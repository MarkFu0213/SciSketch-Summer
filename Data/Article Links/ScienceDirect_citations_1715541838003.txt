Abstract: Summary
Joint injury and osteoarthritis affect millions of people worldwide, but attempts to generate articular cartilage using adult stem/progenitor cells have been unsuccessful. We hypothesized that recapitulation of the human developmental chondrogenic program using pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) may represent a superior approach for cartilage restoration. Using laser-capture microdissection followed by microarray analysis, we first defined a surface phenotype (CD166low/negCD146low/negCD73+CD44lowBMPR1B+) distinguishing the earliest cartilage committed cells (prechondrocytes) at 5–6 weeks of development. Functional studies confirmed these cells are chondrocyte progenitors. From 12 weeks, only the superficial layers of articular cartilage were enriched in cells with this progenitor phenotype. Isolation of cells with a similar immunophenotype from differentiating human PSCs revealed a population of CD166low/negBMPR1B+ putative cartilage-committed progenitors. Taken as a whole, these data define a developmental approach for the generation of highly purified functional human chondrocytes from PSCs that could enable substantial progress in cartilage tissue engineering.

Abstract: Invasion is an important hallmark of cancer involving interactions between the tumor microenvironment and the cancer cells. Hypoxia, low oxygen level, is related to increased invasion and metastasis in many cancers. The aim was to elucidate the effect of hypoxia on invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells (OSCCs), and the applicability of a novel 3-dimentional myoma organotypic invasion model in hypoxia experiments. OSCC cell lines (primary oral carcinoma derived cells UT-SCC-43A, recurrent oral carcinoma cells UT-SCC-43B and aggressive tongue carcinoma cells HSC-3) were studied for their migration and invasion capabilities under normoxia, hypoxia, and in the presence a hypoxia-mimicker cobalt chloride. As expected, the recurrent UT-SCC-43B cells were significantly more aggressive than the primary tumor derived cells. In contrast to tongue carcinoma HSC-3 cells, they only mildly responded to hypoxia in the migration or invasion assays, indicating a cell line specific response of hypoxia on the invasive potential. The modification of the organotypic human tissue-derived matrix via the removal of various yet unidentified soluble factors by rinsing the tissue resulting in stripped matrix substantially changed the invasion pattern of HSC-3 cells and the outcomes of hypoxic treatments. Only in the stripped tissue hypoxia significantly increased invasion, whereas in native intact tissue the induced invasion was not observed. This demonstrates the importance of the soluble factors to the invasion pattern and to the hypoxia response. A metastasis and poor prognosis marker, hypoxia-regulated lysyl oxidase (LOX), was present in the myoma tissue, but could be removed by rinsing. The inhibition of LOX resulted in a decrease in invasion area, but only very mildly in invasion depth. Thus, it may have a role in the modulation of the invasion pattern. Another hypoxia-related poor prognosis marker carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAIX) was induced in HSC-3 cells both by the hypoxic exposure and interestingly in invading HSC-3 cells inside the tissue even in normoxic conditions. In conclusion, this suggests that the intact myoma organotypic model offers optimally hypoxic surroundings, thus being an excellent human tumor microenvironment mimicker.

Abstract: While current PEM fuel cell research is mainly focused on reducing system costs and improving efficiency, less attention is being paid to the possibilities offered by mass-production and economies of scale. PA Consulting Group has identified over-complicated components, fragmented supply chains, and a lack of significant national organisation as rate-limiting processes in the development of the UK fuel cell industry.

Abstract: Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are present in several tissues, e.g. bone marrow, heart muscle, brain and subcutaneous adipose tissue. In invasive infections MSC get in contact with bacteria and bacterial components. Not much is known about how bacterial pathogens interact with MSC and how contact to bacteria influences MSC viability and differentiation potential. In this study we investigated the impact of three different wound infection relevant bacteria, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes, and the cell wall components lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Gram-negative bacteria) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA; Gram-positive bacteria) on viability, proliferation, and osteogenic as well as adipogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (adMSC). We show that all three tested species were able to attach to and internalize into adMSC. The heat-inactivated Gram-negative E. coli as well as LPS were able to induce proliferation and osteogenic differentiation but reduce adipogenic differentiation of adMSC. Conspicuously, the heat-inactivated Gram-positive species showed the same effects on proliferation and adipogenic differentiation, while its cell wall component LTA exhibited no significant impact on adMSC. Therefore, our data demonstrate that osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of adMSC is influenced in an oppositional fashion by bacterial antigens and that MSC-governed regeneration is not necessarily reduced under infectious conditions.

Abstract: Primitive neural stem cells (NSCs) define an early stage of neural induction, thus provide a model to understand the mechanism that controls initial neural commitment. In this study, we investigated primitive NSCs derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). By genome-wide transcriptional profiling, we revealed their unique signature and depicted the molecular changes underlying critical cell fate transitions during early neural induction at a global level. Together with qRT-PCR analysis, our data illustrated that primitive NSCs retained expression of key pluripotency genes Oct4 and Nanog, while exhibiting repression of other pluripotency-related genes Zscan4, Foxp1 and Dusp9 and up-regulation of neural markers Sox1 and Hes1. The early differentiation feature in primitive NSCs was also supported by their intermediate characters on cell cycle profiles. Moreover, re-plating primitive NSCs back to ESC culture condition could reverse them back to ESC stage, as shown by reversible regulation of marker genes, cell cycle profile changes and enhanced embryoid body formation. In addition, our microarray analysis also identified genes differentially expressed in primitive NSCs, and loss-of-function analysis demonstrated that Hes1 and Ccdc141 play important function at this stage, opening up an opportunity to further understand the regulation of early neural commitment.

MicroRNA-31 controls phenotypic modulation of human vascular smooth muscle cells by regulating its target gene cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes,

Abstract: Phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of a variety of proliferative vascular diseases. The cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) has been shown to play an important role in phenotypic modulation of VSMCs. However, the mechanism regulating CREG upstream signaling remains unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been found to play a critical role in cell differentiation via target-gene regulation. This study aimed to identify a miRNA that binds directly to CREG, and may thus be involved in CREG-mediated VSMC phenotypic modulation. Computational analysis indicated that miR-31 bound to the CREG mRNA 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR). miR-31 was upregulated in quiescent differentiated VSMCs and downregulated in proliferative cells stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor and serum starvation, demonstrating a negative relationship with the VSMC differentiation marker genes, smooth muscle α-actin, calponin and CREG. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, CREG and VSMC differentiation marker gene expression levels were shown to be suppressed by a miR-31 mimic, but increased by a miR-31 inhibitor at both protein and mRNA levels. Notably, miR-31 overexpression or inhibition affected luciferase expression driven by the CREG 3′-UTR containing the miR-31 binding site. Furthermore, miR-31-mediated VSMC phenotypic modulation was inhibited in CREG-knockdown human VSMCs. We also determined miR-31 levels in the serum of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), with or without in stent restenosis and in healthy controls. miR-31 levels were higher in the serum of CAD patients with restenosis compared to CAD patients without restenosis and in healthy controls. In summary, these data demonstrate that miR-31 not only directly binds to its target gene CREG and modulates the VSMC phenotype through this interaction, but also can be an important biomarker in diseases involving VSMC phenotypic modulation. These novel findings may have extensive implications for the diagnosis and therapy of a variety of proliferative vascular diseases.

Abstract: Brown adipose tissue is unusual in that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine influences cell destiny in ways generally associated with effects of classical growth factors: regulation of cell proliferation, of apoptosis, and progression of differentiation. The norepinephrine effects are mediated through G-protein-coupled receptors; further mediation of such stimulation to e.g. Erk1/2 activation is in cell biology in general accepted to occur through transactivation of the EGF receptor (by external or internal pathways). We have examined here the significance of such transactivation in brown adipocytes. Stimulation of mature brown adipocytes with cirazoline (α1-adrenoceptor coupled via Gq), clonidine (α2 via Gi) or CL316243 (β3 via Gs) or via β1-receptors significantly activated Erk1/2. Pretreatment with the EGF receptor kinase inhibitor AG1478 had, remarkably, no significant effect on Erk1/2 activation induced by any of these adrenergic agonists (although it fully abolished EGF-induced Erk1/2 activation), demonstrating absence of EGF receptor-mediated transactivation. Results with brown preadipocytes (cells in more proliferative states) were not qualitatively different. Joint stimulation of all adrenoceptors with norepinephrine did not result in synergism on Erk1/2 activation. AG1478 action on EGF-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation showed a sharp concentration–response relationship (IC50 0.3µM); a minor apparent effect of AG1478 on norepinephrine-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation showed nonspecific kinetics, implying caution in interpretation of partial effects of AG1478 as reported in other systems. Transactivation of the EGF receptor is clearly not a universal prerequisite for coupling of G-protein coupled receptors to Erk1/2 signalling cascades.

Abstract: Summary
Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 shedding is associated with increased risk for sexually acquiring HIV. Because Langerhans cells (LCs), the mucosal epithelium resident dendritic cells, are suspected to be one of the initial target cell types infected by HIV following sexual exposure, we examined whether and how HSV-2 affects HIV infection of LCs. Although relatively few HSV-2/HIV-coinfected LCs were detected, HSV-2 dramatically enhanced the HIV susceptibility of LCs within skin explants. HSV-2 stimulated epithelial cell production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including human β defensins and LL-37. LL-37 strongly upregulated the expression of HIV receptors in monocyte-derived LCs (mLCs), thereby enhancing their HIV susceptibility. Culture supernatants of epithelial cells infected with HSV-2 enhanced HIV susceptibility in mLCs, and this effect was abrogated by blocking LL-37 production. These data suggest that HSV-2 enhances sexual transmission of HIV by increasing HIV susceptibility of LCs via epithelial cell production of LL-37.

Abstract: This study aimed at identifying putative modulations of tissue homeostatic parameters in corneal keratinocytes in response to biomechanical cues as basis for innovative cornea biomechanical-tailored biomaterials. Since cornea epithelial biomechanics is already described for contacts on nanostructures, we herein analyzed cell response to mechanical substrate elasticity. Therefore, corneal keratinocytes were established on physiologically-relevant elastic substrates of 40kPa, 130kPa but also on non-physiological stiff substrates of 1.74MPa for 3 days. qPCR revealed that changes in gene expression were only marginal between 40kPa and 130kPa, while significant modulations were seen on 1.74MPa substrates for most tissue-innate biomarkers under study. Gene expression fairly coincided with the protein, with differentiation progression biomarkers involucrin and fillagrin being already significantly increased between elasticities of 40kPa and 130kPa. Regarding focal adhesions, reinforcement was seen for ß1 integrin and phospho- p125FAK between 40kPa and 130kPa, while from 130kPa to 1.74MPa actin redistributed and phospho-p125FAK was strikingly up-regulated. These findings suggest elasticity dependence for differentiation progression and focal adhesion dynamics of corneal keratinocytes, supporting the concept of biomechanics governed regulation of tissue homeostasis. Moreover, this concept in turn can be translated into prospective cornea-tailored biomaterials for therapeutic approaches in ophthalmology.

Abstract: Summary
The immune response against a variety of pathogens can lead to activation of blood formation at ectopic sites, a process termed extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). The underlying mechanisms of EMH have been enigmatic. Investigating splenic EMH in mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), we find that, while cells of the adaptive immune system were dispensable for EMH, natural killer (NK) cells were essential. EMH required recognition of infected cells via activating NK cell receptors Ly49H or NKG2D, and correspondingly, viral interference with NK cell recognition abolished EMH. Surprisingly, development of EMH was not induced by NK cell-derived cytokines but was dependent on perforin-mediated cytotoxicity in order to control virus spread. Spreading virus reduced the numbers of F4/80+ macrophages that were crucial for inflammatory EMH. Hence, whereas MCMV suppresses inflammation-induced EMH, NK cells confine virus spread, thereby protecting extramedullary hematopoietic niches and facilitating EMH.

Abstract: Summary
Copper (Cu) is an essential metal that is toxic at high concentrations. Thus, pathogens often rely on host Cu for growth, but host cells can hyperaccumulate Cu to exert antimicrobial effects. The human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans encodes many Cu-responsive genes, but their role in infection is unclear. We determined that pulmonary C. neoformans infection results in Cu-specific induction of genes encoding the Cu-detoxifying metallothionein (Cmt) proteins. Mutant strains lacking CMTs or expressing Cmt variants defective in Cu-coordination exhibit severely attenuated virulence and reduced pulmonary colonization. Consistent with the upregulation of Cmt proteins, C. neoformans pulmonary infection results in increased serum Cu concentrations and increases and decreases alveolar macrophage expression of the Cu importer (Ctr1) and ATP7A, a transporter implicated in phagosomal Cu compartmentalization, respectively. These studies indicate that the host mobilizes Cu as an innate antifungal defense but C. neoformans senses and neutralizes toxic Cu to promote infection.

Abstract: We present a multi-technique study on in vitro epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human MCF-7 cells cultured on electrospun scaffolds of poly(l-lactic acid) (PLA), with random and aligned fiber orientations. Our aim is to investigate the morphological and genetic characteristics induced by extracellular matrix in tumor cells cultured in different 3D environments, and at different time points. Cell vitality was assessed with AlamarBlue at days 1, 3, 5 and 7. Scanning electron microscopy was performed at culture days 3 and 7. Immunohistochemistry (for E-cadherin, β-catenin, cytokeratins, nucleophosmin, tubulin, Ki-67 and vimentin), immunofluorescence (for F-actin) western blot (for E-cadherin, β-catenin and vimentin) and transmission electron microscopy were carried out at day 7. An EMT gene array followed by PCR analysis confirmed the regulation of selected genes. At day 7, scanning electron microscopy on aligned-PLA revealed spindle-shaped cells gathered in buds and ribbon-like structures, with a higher nucleolar/nuclear ratio and a loss in E-cadherin and β-catenin at immunohistochemistry and western blot. An up-regulation of SMAD2, TGF-β2, TFPI2 and SOX10 was found in aligned-PLA compared to random-PLA cultured cells. The topography of the extracellular matrix has a role in tumor EMT, and a more aggressive phenotype characterizes MCF-7 cells cultured on aligned-PLA scaffold.

Abstract: Recently it has been shown that elevating proton concentration at the cell surface stimulates the formation of membrane invaginations and vesicles accompanied by an enhanced uptake of macromolecules. While the initial induction of inward membrane curvature was rationalized in terms of proton-based increase of charge asymmetry across the membrane, the mechanisms underlying vesicle formation and its scission are still unknown. In light of the critical role of actin in vesicle formation during endocytosis, the present study addresses the involvement of cytoskeletal actin in proton-induced uptake (PIU). The uptake of dextran-FITC is used as a measure for the factual fraction of inward invaginations that undergo scission from the cell's plasma membrane. Our findings show that the rate of PIU in suspended cells is constant, whereas the rate of PIU in adherent cells is gradually increased in time, saturating at the level possessed by suspended cells. This is consistent with pH induced gradual degradation of stress-fibers in adherent cells. Wortmannin and calyculin-A are able to elevate PIU by 25% in adherent cells but not in suspended cells, while cytochalasin-D, rapamycin and latrunculin-A elevate PIU both in adherent and suspended cells. However, extensive actin depolymerization by high concentrations of latrunculin-A is able to inhibit PIU. We conclude that proton-induced membrane vesiculation is restricted by the actin structural resistance to the plasma membrane bending. Nevertheless, a certain degree of cortical actin restructuring is required for the completion of the scission process.

Abstract: Summary
The modular DNA recognition code of the transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) from plant pathogenic bacterial genus Xanthomonas provides a powerful genetic tool to create designer transcription factors (dTFs) targeting specific DNA sequences for manipulating gene expression. Previous studies have suggested critical roles of enhancers in gene regulation and reprogramming. Here, we report dTF activator targeting the distal enhancer of the Pou5f1 (Oct4) locus induces epigenetic changes, reactivates its expression, and substitutes exogenous OCT4 in reprogramming mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Similarly, dTF activator targeting a Nanog enhancer activates Nanog expression and reprograms epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) to iPSCs. Conversely, dTF repressors targeting the same genetic elements inhibit expression of these loci, and effectively block reprogramming. This study indicates that dTFs targeting specific enhancers can be used to study other biological processes such as transdifferentiation or directed differentiation of stem cells.

Abstract: The UK's National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has developed a range of advanced in situ diagnostic techniques to support research into mitigation strategies for critical PEM fuel cell (PEMFC) degradation mechanisms. Recent innovations include a new reference electrode configuration that for the first time allows mapping of the electrode potential across the active area of an operating PEMFC; a novel technique for simultaneous measurement of active catalyst area in each cell in a fuel cell stack; a world-first measurement of the relative humidity profile in the gas channels of a working PEMFC; and a non-invasive thermal imaging technique for detection of hotspots. In addition to providing valuable data on performance and durability, these in situ measurement techniques are being used to validate a 3D fuel cell model under development at NPL, a powerful design optimisation tool that will be available to industry in an accessible software platform.

Abstract: Summary
Deletion of caudal/cdx genes alters hox gene expression and causes defects in posterior tissues and hematopoiesis. Yet, the defects in hox gene expression only partially explain these phenotypes. To gain deeper insight into Cdx4 function, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) combined with gene-expression profiling in zebrafish, and identified the transcription factor spalt-like 4 (sall4) as a Cdx4 target. ChIP-seq revealed that Sall4 bound to its own gene locus and the cdx4 locus. Expression profiling showed that Cdx4 and Sall4 coregulate genes that initiate hematopoiesis, such as hox, scl, and lmo2. Combined cdx4/sall4 gene knockdown impaired erythropoiesis, and overexpression of the Cdx4 and Sall4 target genes scl and lmo2 together rescued the erythroid program. These findings suggest that auto- and cross-regulation of Cdx4 and Sall4 establish a stable molecular circuit in the mesoderm that facilitates the activation of the blood-specific program as development proceeds.

Abstract: Summary
Cell division is a process by which a mother cell divides into genetically identical sister cells, although sister cells often display considerable diversity. In this report, over 350 sister embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were isolated through a microdissection method, and then expression levels of 48 key genes were examined for each sister cell. Our system revealed considerable diversities between sister ESCs at both pluripotent and differentiated states, whereas the similarity between sister ESCs was significantly elevated in a 2i (MEK and GSK3b inhibitors) condition, which is believed to mimic the ground state of pluripotency. DNA methyltransferase 3a/3b were downregulated in 2i-grown ESCs, and the loss of DNA methyltransferases was sufficient to generate nearly identical sister cells. These results suggest that DNA methylation is a major cause of the diversity between sister cells at the pluripotent states, and thus demethylation per se plays an important role in promoting ESC’s self-renewal.

Abstract: The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the principal neurogenic niche present in the adult non-human mammalian brain. Neurons generated in the SVZ migrate along the rostral migratory stream to reach the olfactory bulb. Brain injuries stimulate SVZ neurogenesis and direct migration of new progenitors to the sites of injury. To date, cortical injury-induced adult SVZ neurogenesis in mice remains ambiguous and migration of neural progenitors to the site of injury has not been studied in detail. Here we report that aspiration lesion in the motor cortex induces a transient, but significant increase in the proliferation as well as neurogenesis in the SVZ. New neural progenitors migrate ectopically to the injured area with the assistance of blood vessels and reactive astrocytes. The SVZ origin of these progenitors was further confirmed using lentiviral transduction. In addition, we show that astrocyte-assisted ectopic migration is regulated by CXCR4/SDF-1 signaling pathway. Finally, upon reaching the lesion area, these progenitors differentiate mainly into glial cells and, to a lesser extent, mature neurons. These data provide a detailed account of the changes occurring in the SVZ and the cortex following lesion, and indicate the potential of the endogenous neural progenitors in cortical repair.

Abstract: Previously, it has been shown that heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) can prevent inflammatory damage in experimental autoimmune disease models. Various possible underlying working mechanisms have been proposed. One possibility is that HSP70 induces a tolerogenic phenotype in dendritic cells (DCs) as a result of the direct interaction of the antigen with the DC. Tolerogenic DCs can induce antigen-specific regulatory T cells and dampen pathogenic T cell responses. We show that treatment of murine DCs with either mycobacterial (Mt) or mouse HSP70 and pulsed with the disease-inducing antigen induced suppression of proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA), although mouse HSP70-treated DCs could ameliorate PGIA to a greater extent. In addition, while murine DCs treated with Mt- or mouse HSP70 had no significantly altered phenotype as compared to untreated DCs, HSP70-treated DCs pulsed with pOVA (ovalbumin peptide 323–339) induced a significantly increased production of IL-10 in pOVA-specific T cells. IL-10-producing T cells were earlier shown to be involved in Mt HSP70-induced suppression of PGIA. In conclusion, this study indicates that Mt- and mouse HSP70-treated BMDC can suppress PGIA via an IL-10-producing T cell-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
A network of transcription factors (TFs) determines cell identity, but identity can be altered by overexpressing a combination of TFs. However, choosing and verifying combinations of TFs for specific cell differentiation have been daunting due to the large number of possible combinations of ∼2,000 TFs. Here, we report the identification of individual TFs for lineage-specific cell differentiation based on the correlation matrix of global gene expression profiles. The overexpression of identified TFs—Myod1, Mef2c, Esx1, Foxa1, Hnf4a, Gata2, Gata3, Myc, Elf5, Irf2, Elf1, Sfpi1, Ets1, Smad7, Nr2f1, Sox11, Dmrt1, Sox9, Foxg1, Sox2, or Ascl1—can direct efficient, specific, and rapid differentiation into myocytes, hepatocytes, blood cells, and neurons. Furthermore, transfection of synthetic mRNAs of TFs generates their appropriate target cells. These results demonstrate both the utility of this approach to identify potent TFs for cell differentiation, and the unanticipated capacity of single TFs directly guides differentiation to specific lineage fates.

Abstract: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding and untranslated regions of heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A (HSP70A1A), an inducible molecular chaperone that is responsible for cellular protection against heat stress, have been reported as being associated with heat tolerance. A fragment of the HSP70A1A gene was amplified in Chinese Holstein cattle and eight novel mutations were found. We performed comprehensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analyses of the eight SNPs of the HSP70A1A gene and examined their involvement in heat resistance in 600 Chinese Holstein cattle. Our results revealed the presence of significant differences between individuals carrying haplotype 1 and those without haplotype 1 for most of the heat-tolerance traits. Haplotype 1 increased the risk of heat stress; however, association analysis of its combination with haplotype 2 showed the lowest rectal temperature and red blood cell K+ level, moderate respiratory rate, and the highest red blood cell NKA level, suggesting a heterozygote advantage in the penetration of the phenotype. Protein expression levels in white blood cells among haplotype combinations further confirmed the hypothesis that heterozygotes for haplotypes 1 and 2 are more sensitive to heat stress. We presume that these mutations may be useful in the future as molecular genetic markers to assist selection for heat tolerance in cattle.

Abstract: Background
Continuing efforts in development of non-invasive prenatal genetic tests have focused on the isolation of fetal nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) from maternal blood for decades. Because no fetal cell-specific antibody has been described so far, the present study focused on the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to antigens that are expressed exclusively on fetal NRBCs. Methods: Mice were immunized with fetal erythroid cell membranes and hybridomas screened for Abs using a multi-parameter fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Selected mAbs were evaluated by comparative FACS analysis involving Abs known to bind erythroid cell surface markers (CD71, CD36, CD34), antigen-i, galactose, or glycophorin-A (GPA). Specificity was further confirmed by extensive immunohistological and immunocytological analyses of NRBCs from umbilical cord blood and fetal and adult cells from liver, bone marrow, peripheral blood, and lymphoid tissues. Results: Screening of 690 hybridomas yielded three clones of which Abs from 4B8 and 4B9 clones demonstrated the desired specificity for a novel antigenic structure expressed on fetal erythroblast cell membranes. The antigenic structure identified is different from known surface markers (CD36, CD71, GPA, antigen-i, and galactose), and is not present on circulating adult erythroid cells, except for occasional detectability in adult bone marrow cells. Conclusions:The new mAbs specifically bind the same or highly overlapping epitopes of a surface antigen that is almost exclusively expressed on fetal erythroid cells. The high specificity of the mAbs should facilitate development of simple methods for reliable isolation of fetal NRBCs and their use in non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal genetic status.

Abstract: The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin is required for the induction of transcriptional events that initiate and promote myogenic differentiation. An important effector for calcineurin in striated muscle is the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). The targeting of the enzyme and substrate to specific intracellular compartments by scaffold proteins often confers specificity in phosphatase activity. We now show that the scaffolding protein mAKAP organizes a calcineurin/MEF2 signaling complex in myocytes, regulating gene transcription. A calcineurin/mAKAP/MEF2 complex can be isolated from C2C12 cells and cardiac myocytes, and the calcineurin/MEF2 association is dependent on mAKAP expression. We have identified a peptide comprising the calcineurin binding domain in mAKAP that can disrupt the binding of the phosphatase to the scaffold in vivo. Dominant interference of calcineurin/mAKAP binding blunts the increase in MEF2 transcriptional activity seen during myoblast differentiation, as well as the expression of endogenous MEF2-target genes. Furthermore, disruption of calcineurin binding to mAKAP in cardiac myocytes inhibits adrenergic-induced cellular hypertrophy. Together these data illustrate the importance of calcineurin anchoring by the mAKAP scaffold for MEF2 regulation.

Abstract: The oncoprotein MDM2 (murine double minute 2) is often overexpressed in human tumors and thereby attenuates the function of the tumor suppressor p53. In this study, we investigated the effects of the novel MDM2-inhibitor PXN727 on p53 activation, cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution and radiosensitivity. Since the localization of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) exerts different effects on radioresistance of tumor cells, we investigated the impact of PXN727 on intracellular, membrane, and secreted Hsp70 levels. We could show that PXN727 exerts its effects on wildtype p53 (HCT116 p53+/+, A549) but not p53 depleted (HCT116 p53−/−) or mutated (FaDu) tumor cells. PXN727 activates p53, induces the expression of p21, reduces the proportion of cells in the radioresistant S-phase and induces senescence. Radiosensitivity was significantly increased by PXN727 in HCT116 p53+/+ tumor cells. Furthermore, PXN727 causes a downregulation of Hsp70 membrane expression and an upregulated secretion of Hsp70 in wildtype p53 tumor cells. Our data suggest that re-activation of p53 by MDM2-inhibition modulates Hsp70 membrane expression and secretion which might contribute to the radiosensitizing effect of the MDM2-inhibitor PXN727.

Abstract: Numb is highly expressed throughout the crypt-villus axis of intestinal mucosa and functions as cell fate determinant and integrator of cell-to-cell adhesion. Increased paracellular permeability of intestinal epithelial cells is associated with the epithelial barrier dysfunction of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). The apical junctional complex (AJC) assembly and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation regulate adherens junctions (AJ) and tight junctions (TJ). We determined whether and how Numb modulate the paracellular permeability of intestinal epithelial cells. Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells and their Numb-interfered counterparts were used in the study for physiological, morphological and biological analyses. Numb, expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and located at the plasma membrane of Caco-2 cells in a basolateral to apical distribution, increased in the intestinal epithelial cells with the formation of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Numb expression decreased and accumulated in the cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model. Numb co-localized with E-cadherin, ZO-1 and Par3 at the plasma membrane and interacted with E-cadherin and Par3. Knockdown of Numb in Caco-2 cells altered the F-actin structure during the Ca2+ switch assay, enhanced TNFα-/INF-γ-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction and TJ destruction, and increased the Claudin-2 protein level. Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that NMIIA and F-actin co-localized at the cell surface of Caco-2 cells. Numb knockdown in Caco-2 cells increased F-actin contraction and the abundance of phosphorylated MLC. Numb modulated the intestinal epithelial barrier in a Notch signaling-independent manner. These findings suggest that Numb modulates the paracellular permeability by affecting AJC assembly and MLC phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain blood homeostasis and are the functional units of bone marrow transplantation. To improve the molecular understanding of HSCs and their proximal progenitors, we performed transcriptome analysis within the context of the ImmGen Consortium data set. Gene sets that define steady-state and mobilized HSCs, as well as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), were determined. Genes involved in transcriptional regulation, including a group of putative transcriptional repressors, were identified in multipotent progenitors and HSCs. Proximal promoter analyses combined with ImmGen module analysis identified candidate regulators of HSCs. Enforced expression of one predicted regulator, Hlf, in diverse HSPC subsets led to extensive self-renewal activity ex vivo. These analyses reveal unique insights into the mechanisms that control the core properties of HSPCs.

Abstract: Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are characterized by co-participation of several epigenetic and genetic events during tumorigenesis. Having bypassed cellular senescence barriers during oncogenic transformation, the factors further affecting growth rate of STS cells remain poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the role of gene silencing (DNA promoter methylation of LINE-1, PTEN), genetic aberrations (karyotype, KRAS and BRAF mutations) as well as their contribution to the proliferation rate and migratory potential that underlies “initial” and “final” passage sarcoma cells. Three different cell lines were used, SW982 (synovial sarcoma), U2197 (malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH)) and HT1080 (fibrosarcoma). Increased proliferative potential of final passage STS cells was not associated with significant differences in methylation (LINE-1, PTEN) and mutation status (KRAS, BRAF), but it was dependent on the amount of chromosomal aberrations. Collectively, our data demonstrate that these fairly differentiated/advanced cancer cell lines have still the potential to gain an additional spontaneous growth benefit without external influences and that maintenance of increased proliferative potential towards longevity of STS cells (having crossed senescence barriers) may be independent of overt epigenetic alterations.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding gut microbiota alterations associated with HIV infection and factors that drive these alterations may help explain gut-linked diseases prevalent with HIV. 16S rRNA sequencing of feces from HIV-infected individuals revealed that HIV infection is associated with highly characteristic gut community changes, and antiretroviral therapy does not consistently restore the microbiota to an HIV-negative state. Despite the chronic gut inflammation characteristic of HIV infection, the associated microbiota showed limited similarity with other inflammatory states and instead showed increased, rather than decreased, diversity. Meta-analysis revealed that the microbiota of HIV-infected individuals in the U.S. was most similar to a Prevotella-rich community composition typically observed in healthy individuals in agrarian cultures of Malawi and Venezuela and related to that of U.S. individuals with carbohydrate-rich, protein- and fat-poor diets. By evaluating innate and adaptive immune responses to lysates from bacteria that differ with HIV, we explore the functional drivers of these compositional differences.

Abstract: Summary
Despite extensive ex vivo investigation, the spatiotemporal organization of immune cells interacting with virus-infected cells in tissues remains uncertain. To address this, we used intravital multiphoton microscopy to visualize immune cell interactions with virus-infected cells following epicutaneous vaccinia virus (VV) infection of mice. VV infects keratinocytes in epidermal foci and numerous migratory dermal inflammatory monocytes that outlie the foci. We observed Ly6G+ innate immune cells infiltrating and controlling foci, while CD8+ T cells remained on the periphery killing infected monocytes. Most antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the skin did not interact with virus-infected cells. Blocking the generation of reactive nitrogen species relocated CD8+ T cells into foci, modestly reducing viral titers. Depletion of Ly6G+ and CD8+ cells dramatically increased viral titers, consistent with their synergistic but spatially segregated viral clearance activities. These findings highlight previously unappreciated differences in the anatomic specialization of antiviral immune cell subsets.

Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the protective effects of Cycloartenyl ferulate (CF) against Paraquat (PQ)-induced cytotoxicity and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. The results show that, CF could reverse the PQ-induced growth inhibition and release of lactate dehydrogenase in HK-2 human proximal tubular cells. Treatment with PQ induced apoptosis in HK-2 cells, as evidenced by accumulation of sub-G1 cell population, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and translocation of phosphatidylserine, which were significantly attenuated by co-incubation with CF. Mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway contributed importantly to PQ-induced apoptosis, as revealed by the activation of caspase-3/-9, cleavage of PARP, depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential regulated by Bcl-2 family members, and overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which were also effectively blocked by CF. Moreover, treatments of PQ strongly inhibited the expression of Nrf2 and the downstream effectors, HO1 and NQO1. However, co-treatment with CF effectively reversed this action of PQ. Furthermore, silencing of Nrf2 by the siRNA technique significantly blocked the cytoprotective effects of CF against PQ-induced apoptosis, which suggest the important role of Nrf2 signaling pathway an cell apoptosis induced by PQ. Taken together, this study provides a novel strategy for molecular intervention against PQ-induced nephrotoxicity by using phytochemicals.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterized by early loss of retinal capillary pericytes and microvascular dysfunction. We recently showed that pro-oxidative stress and pro-apoptotic thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) is significantly up-regulated in rat retinas in experimental diabetes and mediates inflammation and apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesize here that TXNIP up-regulation in pericyte plays a causative role in oxidative stress and apoptosis under sustained high glucose exposure in culture. We maintained a rat retinal capillary pericyte cell line (TR-rPCT1) for 5 days under low glucose (LG, 5.5mM) or high glucose (HG, 25mM) with or without anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (5mM, NAC), Azaseine (2μM, AzaS), an inhibitor of TXNIP, and TXNIP siRNA (siTXNIP3, 20nM). The results show that HG increases TXNIP expression in TR-rPCT1, which correlates positively with ROS generation, protein S-nitrosylation, and pro-apoptotic caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, pericyte apoptosis is demonstrated by DNA fragmentation (alkaline comet assay) and a reduction in MTT survival assay. Treatment of TR-rPCT1 with NAC or an inhibition of TXNIP by AzaS or siTXNIP3 each reduces HG-induced ROS, caspase-3 activation and DNA damage demonstrating that TXNIP up-regulation under chronic hyperglycemia is critically involved in cellular oxidative stress, DNA damage and retinal pericyte apoptosis. Thus, TXNIP represents a novel gene and drug target to prevent pericyte loss and progression of DR.

Abstract: Summary
Although the mammalian heart is one of the least regenerative organs in the body, recent evidence indicates that the myocardium undergoes a certain degree of renewal to maintain homeostasis during normal aging. However, the cellular origin of cardiomyocyte renewal has remained elusive due to lack of lineage tracing experiments focusing on putative adult cardiac precursor cells. We have generated triple-transgenic mice based on the tet-cre system to identify descendants of cells that have expressed the stem cell marker Sca1. We found a significant and lasting contribution of Sca1-derived cells to cardiomyocytes during normal aging. Ischemic damage and pressure overload resulted in increased differentiation of Sca1-derived cells to the different cell types present in the heart. Our results reveal a source of cells for cardiomyocyte renewal and provide a possible explanation for the limited contribution of Sca1-derived cells to myocardial repair under pathological conditions.

Abstract: Predicting the prognosis of comatose, post-cardiac-arrest patients is a complex problem in clinical practice. There are several established methods to foretell neurological outcome; however, further prognostic markers are needed. HSP70 (HSPA1A), which increases rapidly in response to severe stress (among others after ischemic or hypoxic events), is a biomarker of cell damage in the ischemic brain and spinal cord. We hypothesized that HSP70 might be a reliable predictor of mortality in post-cardiac-arrest patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of extracellular HSP70 in the systemic inflammatory response over time, as well as the predictive value in cardiac arrest patients. Here, we show that the elevation of HSP70 levels in resuscitated patients and their persistence is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality after a cardiac arrest. Forty-six cardiac arrest patients were successfully cooled to 32–34°C for 24 h, and followed up for 30 days. Twenty-four patients (52.2 %) were alive by the end of follow-up, and 22 patients (47.8 %) died. Forty-six patients with stable cardiovascular disease served as controls. Extracellular HSP70 (measured by ELISA in blood samples) was elevated in all resuscitated patients (1.31 [0.76–2.73] and 1.70 [1.20–2.37] ng/ml for survivors and non-survivors, respectively), compared with the controls (0.59 [0.44–0.83] ng/ml). HSP70 level decreased significantly in survivors, but persisted in non-survivors, and predicted 30-day mortality regardless of age, sex, complications, and the APACHE II score. Extracellular HSP70 could prove useful for estimating prognosis in comatose post-cardiac-arrest patients.

Abstract: Tympanic membrane perforations are common and represent a management challenge to clinicians. Current treatments for chronic perforations involve a graft surgery and require general anaesthesia, including associated costs and morbidities. Bioactive molecules (e.g. growth factors, cytokines) play an important role in promoting TM wound healing following perforation and the use of growth factors as a topical treatment for tympanic membrane perforations has been suggested as an alternative to surgery. However, the choice of bioactive molecules best suited to promote wound healing has yet to be identified. We investigated the effects of hyaluronic acid, vitronectin, TGF-α, IL-24 and their combinations on migration, proliferation and adhesion of cultured human tympanic membrane-derived keratinocytes (hTM), in addition to their possible mechanisms of action. We found that TGF-α, TGF-α/HA and TGF-α/IL-24 promoted wound healing by significantly increasing both migration and proliferation. TGF-α and/or HA treated cells showed comparable cell–cell adhesion whilst maintaining an epithelial cell phenotype. With the use of receptor binding inhibitors for ErbB1 (AG1478) and CD44 (BRIC235), we revealed that the activation of ErbB1 is required for TGF-α/HA-mediated migration and proliferation. These results suggest factors that may be incorporated into a tissue-engineered membrane or directly as topical treatment for tympanic membrane perforations and hence reduce the need for a surgery.

Abstract: Although clusterin (CLU) was originally identified as a secreted glycoprotein that plays cytoprotective role, several intracellular CLU variants have been recently identified in the diverse pathological conditions. The mechanistic basis of these variants is now believed to be alternative splicing and retrotranslocation. Here, we uncovered, an unglycosylated and signal sequence-unprocessed, CLU variant in the cytosol. This variant proved to be a product that cotranslationally rerouted to the cytosol during translocation. Cytosolic CLU was prone to aggregation at peri-nuclear region of cells and induced cell death. Signal sequence is shown to be an important determinant for cytosolic CLU generation and aggregation. These results provide not only a new mechanistic insight into the cytosolic CLU generation but also an idea for therapeutic mislocalization of CLU as a strategy for cancer treatment.

Abstract: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) confers an increased risk of both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), an intracellular polypeptide, can be exposed on the plasma membrane and/or released into the circulation, eliciting both native and immune responses that may contribute to vascular damage. Our aim was to assess if serum anti-Hsp70 antibody levels were cross-sectionally associated with uncomplicated MetS. A cross-sectional case–control study from the nondiabetic cohort of the Casale Monferrato Study was performed. Subjects with established CVD and/or abnormal renal function were excluded. Case subjects (n = 180) were defined as those fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of MetS. Control subjects (n = 136) were completely free of any component of the MetS. Serum anti-Hsp70 levels were measured by immunoenzymatic assay. We found that anti-Hsp70 antibody levels were significantly higher in cases than in control subjects [122.6 (89.5–155.6) vs 107.1 (77.3–152.4) μg/ml, p = 0.04], even after age and sex adjustment. In logistic regression analysis, higher levels of log-anti-Hsp70 conferred greater odds ratio (OR) for MetS, independently of age and sex. There was a statistically significant trend of ORs across quartiles of anti-Hsp70 and values greater than 108.0 μg/ml conferred a 77 % increased OR of MetS as compared with values in the lower quartiles. The strength of the association slightly decreased after further adjustment for apolipoprotein B, smoking, and albumin excretion rate. In conclusion, our results show that serum anti-Hsp70 antibody levels are independently associated with nascent MetS.

Abstract: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are key cellular components for musculoskeletal tissue engineering strategies. Furthermore, recent data suggest that BMSCs are involved in the development of Osteoarthritis (OA) being a frequently occurring degenerative joint disease. Reliable reference genes for the molecular evaluation of BMSCs derived from donors exhibiting OA as a primary co-morbidity have not been reported on yet. Hence, the aim of the study was to identify reference genes suitable for comparative gene expression analyses using OA-BMSCs. Passage 1 bone marrow derived BMSCs were isolated from n=13 patients with advanced stage idiopathic hip osteoarthritis and n=15 age-matched healthy donors. The expression of 31 putative reference genes was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using a commercially available TaqMan® assay. Calculating the coefficient of variation (CV), mRNA expression stability was determined and afterwards validated using geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. Importin 8 (IPO8), TATA box binding protein (TBP), and cancer susceptibility candidate 3 (CASC3) were identified as the most stable reference genes. Notably, commonly used reference genes, e.g. beta-actin (ACTB) and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) were among the most unstable genes. For normalization of gene expression data of OA-BMSCs the combined use of IPO8, TBP, and CASC3 gene is recommended.

Abstract: Recent studies suggested that miRNAs are involved in the development of the pathogenesis of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Rapamycin, a widely used mTOR inhibitor, has been demonstrated to slow down the progression of HIVAN. However, the role of miRNA in the regulation of these processes has not been investigated so far. In the current study, we have used a microarray-based approach in combination with real-time PCR to profile the miRNA expression patterns in rapamycin-treated HIVAN mice (Tg26). Our results demonstrated that 19 miRNAs belonging to 13 different families expressed differentially in renal tissues of rapamycin-receiving Tg26 mice when compared to Tg26 mice-receiving saline only. The patterns of miRNAs expression in rapamycin-receiving Tg26 mice took a reverse turn. These miRNAs were classified into 8 functional categories. In in vitro studies, we examined the expression of specific miRNAs in HIV-1 transduced human podocytes (HIV/HPs). HIV/HPs displayed attenuation of expression of miR-99a, -100a, -199a and miR-200, whereas, rapamycin inhibited this effect of HIV. These findings suggest that rapamycin-mediated up-regulation of specific miRNAs could contribute to amelioration of renal lesions in HIVAN mice.

Abstract: Patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are often treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but only 50% is cured. A possible explanation for treatment failure is therapy resistance of the cancer stem cells (CSCs). The application of compounds specifically targeting these CSCs, in addition to routinely used therapeutics, would likely improve clinical outcome. We demonstrate that the previously described monoclonal antibody K984 recognizes the CD98 cell surface protein, which is specifically expressed by cells forming the squamous basal cell layer, the region where the squamous stem cells reside. Moreover, CD98 is highly resistant to the proteolytic enzymes required for CSC enrichment procedures. We show that CD98high cells, in contrast to CD98low cells, are able to generate tumors in immunodeficient mice, indicating that CD98high cells have stem cell characteristics. Furthermore, the CD98high subpopulation expresses high levels of cell cycle control and DNA repair genes, while the CD98low fraction shows expression patterns that represent the more differentiated cells forming the bulk of the tumor. CD98 is a promising CSC enrichment marker in HNSCC. Our data support the CSC concept in head and neck cancer and the potential relevance of these cells for treatment outcome.

Abstract: The balance between quiescence and proliferation of HSCs is an important regulator of hematopoiesis. Loss of quiescence frequently results in HSCs exhaustion, which underscores the importance of tight regulation of proliferation in these cells. Studies have indicated that cyclin-dependent kinases are involved in the regulation of quiescence in HSCs. BRCA1 plays an important role in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks, cell cycle, apoptosis and transcription. BRCA1 is expressed in the bone marrow. However, the function of BRCA1 in HSCs is unknown. In our study, we generated BRCA1 transgenic mice to investigate the effects of BRCA1 on the mechanisms of quiescence and differentiation in HSCs. The results demonstrate that over-expression of BRCA1 in the bone marrow impairs the development of B lymphocytes. Furthermore, BRCA1 induced an increase in the number of LSKs, LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs and MPPs. A competitive transplantation assay found that BRCA1 transgenic mice failed to reconstitute hematopoiesis. Moreover, BRCA1 regulates the expression of p21waf1/cip1 and p57kip2, which results in a loss of quiescence in LSKs. Together, over-expression of BRCA1 in bone marrow disrupted the quiescent of LSKs, induced excessive accumulation of LSKs, and disrupted differentiation of the HSCs, which acts through the down-regulated of p21waf1/cip1 and p57kip2.

Abstract: Proton efflux via voltage-gated proton channels (Hv1) is considered to mediate the charge compensation necessary to preserve NADPH oxidase activity during the respiratory burst. Using the Hv1 inhibitor Zn2+, we found that the PMA-induced respiratory burst of human neutrophils is inhibited when assessed as extracellular production of O2− and H2O2, in accordance with literature studies, but, surprisingly, unaffected when measured as oxygen consumption or total (extracellular plus intracellular) H2O2 production. Furthermore, we show that inhibiting Hv1 with Zn2+ results in an increased production of intracellular ROS. Similar results, i.e. decreased extracellular and increased intracellular ROS production, were obtained using a human granulocyte-like cell line with severely impaired Hv1 expression. Acidic extracellular pH, which dampens proton efflux, also augmented intracellular production of H2O2. Zinc caused an increase in the rate but not in the extent of depolarization and cytosolic acidification indicating that mechanisms other than proton efflux take part in charge compensation. Our results suggest a hitherto unpredicted mechanism of charge compensation whereby, in the absence of proton efflux, part of O2− generated within gp91phox in the plasma membrane is shunted intracellularly down electrochemical gradient to dampen excessive depolarization. This would preserve NADPH oxidase activity under conditions such as the inflammatory exudate in which the acidic pH hinders charge compensation by proton efflux.

Abstract: Transitions of the cancer cell phenotype between epithelial and mesenchymal states (EMT) are likely to alter the patterns of intercellular communication. In this regard we have previously documented that EMT-like changes trigger quantitative rearrangements in exosomal vesicle emission in A431 cancer cells driven by oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here we report that extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by these cancer cells in their epithelial and mesenchymal states exhibit profound qualitative differences in their proteome. Thus, induction of the EMT-like state through blockade of E-cadherin and EGFR stimulation provoked a mesenchymal shift in cellular morphology and enrichment in the CD44-high/CD24-low immunophenotype, often linked to cellular stemness. This change also resulted in reprogramming of the EV-related proteome (distinct from that of corresponding cells), which contained 30 unique protein signals, and revealed enrichment in pathways related to cellular growth, cell-to-cell signaling, and cell movement. Some of the most prominent EV-related proteins were validated, including integrin α2 and tetraspanin CD9. We propose that changes in cellular differentiation status translate into unique qualitative rearrangements in the cargo of EVs, a process that may have implications for intercellular communication and could serve as source of new biomarkers to detect EMT-like processes in cancer.

Abstract: Partial mutation of intraflagellar transport 80 (IFT80) in humans causes Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) and short-rib polydactyly (SRP) syndrome type III. These diseases are autosomal recessive chondrodysplasias that share clinical similarities, including shortened long bones and constricted thoracic cage. However, the role and mechanism of IFT80 in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation and function remain largely unknown. We hypothesize that IFT80 is required for the formation and function of cilia and plays a critical role in chondrogenic differentiation by regulating Hedgehog (Hh) and Wingless (Wnt) signaling pathways. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the IFT80 expression pattern and found that IFT80 was predominantly expressed in growth plate chondrocytes and during chondrogenic differentiation. Silencing IFT80 impaired cilia formation and chondrogenic differentiation in mouse bone marrow derived stromal cells (BMSCs), and decreased the expression of chondrocyte marker genes—collagen II and aggrecan. Additionally, silencing IFT80 down-regulated Hh signaling activity whereas up-regulated Wnt signaling activity. The overexpression of Gli2 in IFT80-silenced cells promoted chondrogenesis and recovered the chondrogenic deficiency from IFT80 silencing. Overall, our results demonstrate that IFT80 is essential for chondrocyte differentiation by regulating the Hh and Wnt signaling pathways.

Abstract: Using a glutathione S-transferase pull-down liquid chromatography–coupled tandem mass spectrometry approach and immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis, we found that heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) was involved in the complex formed by atypical protein kinase Cι (PKCι) and LC3 in the esophageal cancer cell line KYSE30. Further study indicated that Hsc70 was targeted by autophagic degradation, and knockdown of PKCι down-regulated Hsc70 by promoting autophagy. PKCι knockdown sensitized cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, whereas forced PKCι expression counteracted the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis via Hsc70.

Abstract: The relationship between serum anti-heat shock protein (Hsp)27 antibody and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels and indices of cardiac function were investigated in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or heart valve replacement. The changes in anti-Hsp27 antibody titers and hs-CRP levels were compared among patients undergoing off-pump and on-pump CABG or valvular heart replacement. Fifty-three patients underwent off-pump, on-pump CABG, and heart valvular replacement in each group. Serum anti-Hsp27 titers and hs-CRP values were measured 24 h before and after the operation and at discharge. Echocardiography was performed before surgery and before discharge. The results were compared with values from 83 healthy controls. hs-CRP levels increased and anti-Hsp27 antibody decreased following surgery (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively), although these changes were independent of operative procedure (P = 0.361 and P = 0.120, respectively). Anti-Hsp27 antibody levels were higher at the time of discharge (P = 0.016). Only in coronary patients were anti-Hsp27 antibody levels negatively associated with E/E′ (r = −0.268, P = 0.022), a marker of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. In conclusions, anti-Hsp27 antibody levels are associated with indices of cardiac function in coronary patients. Cardiopulmonary bypass had no significant effect on the induction of changes in anti-Hsp27 levels. Moreover, anti-Hsp27 antibody levels fell in all groups postoperatively; this may be due to the formation of immune complexes of antigen–antibody, and antibody levels were higher at the time of discharge.

Abstract: Background
Increased proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contribute importantly to the formation of both atherosclerotic and restenotic lesions. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of magnolol on VSMC migration.
Methods
The proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) stimulated VSMCs was performed by gelatin zymography. VSMC migration was assessed by wound healing and Boyden chamber methods. Collagen induced VSMC adhesion was determined by spectrofluorimeter and stress fibers formation was evaluated by fluorescence microscope. The expression of signaling molecules involved in stress fibers formation was determined by western blot. The phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC20) was determined by urea-glycerol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine the expression of β1-integrin and collagen type I in the injured carotid arteries of rats on day 35 after vascular injury.
Results
VSMC migration was strongly inhibited by magnolol without affecting MMPs expression. Also, magnolol inhibited β1-integrin expression, FAK phosphorylation and RhoA and Cdc42 activation to inhibit the collagen induced stress fibers formation. Moreover, magnolol inhibited the phosphorylation of MLC20. Our in vivo results showed that magnolol inhibited β1-integrin expression, collagen type I deposition and FAK phosphorylation in injured carotid arteries without affecting MMP-2 activity.
Conclusions
Magnolol inhibited VSMC migration via inhibition of cytoskeletal remodeling pathway to attenuate neointima formation.
General significance
This study provides a rationale for further evaluation of magnolol for the management of atherosclerosis and restenosis.

Abstract: Although previous studies have shown that autoantigens such as Hsps have been implicated by induction of an autoimmune process in the development of atherosclerosis, the exact role of anti-Hsp70 antibody in atherosclerosis is unknown. In the present study, the levels of anti-Hsp70 autoantibodies and oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) were all significantly increased, and they were strongly correlated in an atherosclerosis model. After the endothelial cells were incubated with 20 μg/mL OxLDL for 12 h at 37°C and followed by 90 min recovery, Hsp70 positive staining of OxLDL-treated endothelial cells was observed on the cell surface in immunostaining and flow cytometric analysis. This membrane Hsp70 was not from culture supernatant Hsp70 and binding of extracellular Hsp70 but was defined as endothelial surface membrane Hsp70. Furthermore, only in the OxLDL-treated group, but not in the untreated group, 51Cr-labeled endothelial cells were lysed by anti-Hsp70 antibody (BD091, IgAS) in the presence of either complement or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Control antibodies, including IgNor, mAb to Hsp70 (SPA-810), and mAbs to Factor VIII, α-actin, and CD3 showed no cytotoxic effects. In conclusion, anti-Hsp70 antibodies could be reacting with the endothelial surface membrane Hsp70 induced by OxLDL and were able to mediate endothelial cytotoxicity. There is a possibility that a humoral immune reaction to endothelial surface membrane Hsp70 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Various C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), including Mincle and Dectin-2, function as pattern recognition receptors and play a central role in immunity to fungal pathogens. However, the precise structures of the CLR ligands in various pathogenic fungi have yet to be completely defined. Here we report that Malassezia, an opportunistic skin fungal pathogen, is cooperatively recognized by Mincle and Dectin-2 through distinct ligands. Solvent-based fractionation revealed that Mincle and Dectin-2 recognize lipophilic and hydrophilic components of Malassezia, respectively. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed glyceroglycolipid and unique mannosyl fatty acids linked to mannitol as two Mincle ligands. An O-linked mannobiose-rich glycoprotein was identified as a Malassezia ligand for Dectin-2. Cytokine production in response to the Mincle ligands and the Dectin-2 ligand was abrogated in Mincle−/− and Dectin-2−/− dendritic cells, respectively. These results demonstrate that Mincle and Dectin-2 recognize distinct ligands in Malassezia to induce host immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
XopD, a type III secretion effector from Xanthomonas euvesicatoria (Xcv), the causal agent of bacterial spot of tomato, is required for pathogen growth and delay of host symptom development. XopD carries a C-terminal SUMO protease domain, a host range determining nonspecific DNA-binding domain and two EAR motifs typically found in repressors of stress-induced transcription. The precise target(s) and mechanism(s) of XopD are obscure. We report that XopD directly targets the tomato ethylene responsive transcription factor SlERF4 to suppress ethylene production, which is required for anti-Xcv immunity and symptom development. SlERF4 expression was required for Xcv ΔxopD-induced ethylene production and ethylene-stimulated immunity. XopD colocalized with SlERF4 in subnuclear foci and catalyzed SUMO1 hydrolysis from lysine 53 of SlERF4, causing SlERF4 destabilization. Mutation of lysine 53 prevented SlERF4 sumoylation, decreased SlERF4 levels, and reduced SlERF4 transcription. These data suggest that XopD desumoylates SlERF4 to repress ethylene-induced transcription required for anti-Xcv immunity.

Abstract: CEACAM1 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen Cell Adhesion molecule 1), an activation induced cell surface marker of T-cells, modulates the T-cell immune response by inhibition of the T-cell and IL-2 receptors. Since T-cells undergo activation induced cell death via Fas activation, it was of interest to determine if this pathway was also affected by CEACAM1. Previously, we identified a novel biochemical interaction between CEACAM1 and the armadillo repeats of β-catenin in Jurkat cells, in which two critical residues, H469 and K470 of the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-4L played an essential role; while in other studies, β-catenin was shown to regulate Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. CEACAM1 expression in Jurkat cells leads to the re-distribution of β-catenin to the actin cytoskeleton as well as inhibition of β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation and its degradation after Fas stimulation. As a result, Fas-mediated apoptosis in these cells was inhibited. The K470A mutation of CEACAM1 partially rescued the inhibitory effect, in agreement with the prediction that a CEACAM1–β-catenin interaction pathway is involved. Although CEACAM1 has two ITIMs, they were not tyrosine-phosphorylated upon Fas ligation, indicating an ITIM independent mechanism; however, mutation of the critical residue S508, located between the ITIMs, to aspartic acid and a prerequisite for ITIM activation, abrogates the inhibitory activity of CEACAM1 to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Since Fas-mediated apoptosis is a major form of activation-induced cell death, our finding supports the idea that CEACAM1 is a general inhibitory molecule for T-cell activation utilizing a variety of pathways.

Abstract: Physical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) can control cellular phenotypes via mechanotransduction, which is the process of translation of mechanical stresses into biochemical signals. While current research is clarifying the relationship between mechanotransduction and cytoskeleton or adhesion complexes, the contribution of transcription factors to mechanotransduction is not well understood. The results of this study revealed that the transcription factor NF-κB, a major regulator for immunoreaction and cancer progression, is responsive to substrate stiffness. NF-κB activation was temporarily induced in H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells grown on a stiff substrate but not in cells grown on a soft substrate. Although the activation of NF-κB was independent of the activity of integrin β1, an ECM-binding protein, the activation was dependent on actomyosin contractions induced by phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC). Additionally, the inhibition of MRLC phosphorylation by Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 reduced the activity of NF-κB. We also observed substrate-specific morphology of the cells, with cells grown on the soft substrate appearing more rounded and cells grown on the stiff substrate appearing more spread out. Inhibiting NF-κB activation caused a reversal of these morphologies on both substrates. These results suggest that substrate stiffness regulates NF-κB activity via actomyosin contractions, resulting in morphological changes.

Abstract: Dental pulp inflammation has long been perceived as a negative factor leading to pulp disruption. Previous studies have suggested that the inflammatory reaction might be a prerequisite for the burst of progenitors implicated in pulp repair. To investigate the migration of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) in response to human dental pulp fibroblasts (HDPFs) nemosis, an in vitro model of nemosis-induced inflammation in three-dimensional culture was used in this study. We observed HDPF spheroid formation and that cell–cell adhesion between HDPFs leads to necrosis. Cell death detection and cell counting kit-8 assays showed reduced live cell numbers and increased levels of cell membrane leakage in HDPF spheroids. HDPFs spheroids expressed cyclooxygenase-2 and released an increasing amount of prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-8, indicating inflammation in response to nemosis. The Transwell assays showed that the conditioned medium from HDPFs spheroids significantly induced hDPSCs migration more than the medium from the monolayer. Taken together, these results indicate that HDPFs spheroids induce nemosis and contribute to the migration of hDPSCs. This model might provide a potential research tool for studying interactions between fibroblasts and stem cells, and studies concerning nemosis-targeted stem cells might help treat pulp inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) could provide an infinite source of clinically relevant cells with potential applications in regenerative medicine. However, hPSC lines vary in their capacity to generate specialized cells, and the development of universal protocols for the production of tissue-specific cells remains a major challenge. Here, we have addressed this limitation for the endodermal lineage by developing a defined culture system to expand and differentiate human foregut stem cells (hFSCs) derived from hPSCs. hFSCs can self-renew while maintaining their capacity to differentiate into pancreatic and hepatic cells. Furthermore, near-homogenous populations of hFSCs can be obtained from hPSC lines which are normally refractory to endodermal differentiation. Therefore, hFSCs provide a unique approach to bypass variability between pluripotent lines in order to obtain a sustainable source of multipotent endoderm stem cells for basic studies and to produce a diversity of endodermal derivatives with a clinical value.

Abstract: Src-family tyrosine kinases are aberrantly activated in cancers, and this activation is associated with malignant tumor progression. v-Src, encoded by the v-src transforming gene of the Rous sarcoma virus, is a mutant variant of the cellular proto-oncogene c-Src. Although investigations with temperature sensitive mutants of v-Src have shown that v-Src induces many oncogenic processes, the effects on cell division are unknown. Here, we show that v-Src inhibits cellular proliferation of HCT116, HeLa S3 and NIH3T3 cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that inducible expression of v-Src results in an accumulation of 4N cells. Time-lapse analysis revealed that binucleation is induced through the inhibition of cytokinesis, a final step of cell division. The localization of Mklp1, which is essential for cytokinesis, to the spindle midzone is inhibited in v-Src-expressing cells. Intriguingly, Aurora B, which regulates Mklp1 localization at the midzone, is delocalized from the spindle midzone and the midbody but not from the metaphase chromosomes upon v-Src expression. Mklp2, which is responsible for the relocation of Aurora B from the metaphase chromosomes to the spindle midzone, is also lost from the spindle midzone. These results suggest that v-Src inhibits cytokinesis through the delocalization of Mklp1 and Aurora B from the spindle midzone, resulting in binucleation.

Abstract: The promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is a tumor suppressor protein that regulates a variety of important cellular processes, including gene expression, DNA repair and cell fate decisions. Integral to its function is the ability of PML to form nuclear bodies (NBs) that serve as hubs for the interaction and modification of over 90 cellular proteins. There are seven canonical isoforms of PML, which encode diverse C-termini generated by alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Recruitment of specific cellular proteins to PML NBs is mediated by protein–protein interactions with individual PML isoforms. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen employing peptide sequences unique to PML isoform I (PML-I), we identified an interaction with the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit K (eIF3K), and in the process identified a novel eIF3K isoform, which we term eIF3K-2. We further demonstrate that eIF3K and PML interact both in vitro via pull-down assays, as well as in vivo within human cells by co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunofluorescence. In addition, eIF3K isoform 2 (eIF3K-2) colocalizes to PML bodies, particularly those enriched in PML-I, while eIF3K isoform 1 associates poorly with PML NBs. Thus, we report eIF3K as the first known subunit of the eIF3 translation pre-initiation complex to interact directly with the PML protein, and provide data implicating alternative splicing of both PML and eIF3K as a possible regulatory mechanism for eIF3K localization at PML NBs.

Abstract: Background
Breast cancer is the major cause of cancer-related deaths in females world-wide. Doxorubicin-based therapy has limited efficacy in breast cancer due to drug resistance, which has been shown to be associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the molecular mechanisms linking the EMT and drug resistance in breast cancer cells remain unclear. Dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), a member of the dual specificity phosphatase family, is associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation; however, its role in breast cancer progression is controversial.
Methods
We used cell viability assays, Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining, combined with siRNA interference, to evaluate chemoresistance and the EMT in MCF-7 and adriamycin-resistant MCF-7/ADR breast cancer cells, and investigate the underlying mechanisms.
Results
Knockdown of DUSP4 significantly increased the chemosensitivity of MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR breast cancer cells to doxorubicin, and MCF-7/ADR cells which expressed high levels of DUSP4 had a mesenchymal phenotype. Furthermore, knockdown of DUSP4 reversed the EMT in MCF-7/ADR cells, as demonstrated by upregulation of epithelial biomarkers and downregulation of mesenchymal biomarkers, and also increased the chemosensitivity of MCF-7/ADR cells to doxorubicin.
Conclusions
DUSP4 might represent a potential drug target for inhibiting drug resistance and regulating the process of the EMT during the treatment of breast cancer.

Abstract: The role of Nrf2 in disease prevention and treatment is well documented; however the specific role of Nrf2 in skeletal muscle is not well described. The current study investigated whether Nrf2 plays a protective role in an STZ-induced model of skeletal muscle atrophy. Modulation of Nrf2 through siRNA resulted in a more robust differentiation of C2C12s, whereas increasing Nrf2 with sulforaphane treatment inhibited differentiation. Diabetic muscle atrophy was not dramatically influenced by Nrf2 genotype, since no differences were observed in total atrophy (all fiber types combined) between WT+STZ and KO+STZ animals. Nrf2-KO animals however illustrated alterations in muscle size of Fast, Type II myosin expressing fibers. KO+STZ animals show significant alterations in myosin isoform expression in the GAST. Similarly, KO controls mimic both WT+STZ and KO+STZ muscle alterations in mitochondrial subunit expression. PGC-1α, a well-established player in mitochondrial biogenesis and myosin isoform expression, was decreased in KO control, WT+STZ and KO+STZ SOL muscle. Similarly, PGC-1α protein levels are correlated with Nrf2 levels in C2C12s after modulation by Nrf2 siRNA or sulforaphane treatment. We provide experimental evidence indicating Nrf2 plays a role in myocyte differentiation and governs molecular alterations in contractile and metabolic properties in an STZ-induced model of muscle atrophy.

Abstract: Understanding how to specify rapid differentiation of human neural progenitor towards enriched non-transformed human astrocyte progenitors will provide a critical cell source to further our understanding of how astrocytes play a pivotal role in neural function and development. Human neural progenitors derived from pluripotent embryonic stem cells and propagated in adherent serum-free cultures provide a fate restricted renewable source for quick production of neural cells; however, such cells are highly refractive to astrocytogenesis and show a strong neurogenic bias, similar to neural progenitors from the early embryonic central nervous system (CNS). We found that several astrocytic genes are hypermethylated in such progenitors potentially preventing generation of astrocytes and leading to the proneuronal fate of these progenitors. However, epigenetic modification by Azacytidine (Aza-C) and Trichostatin A (TSA), with concomitant signaling from BMP2 and LIF in neural progenitor cultures shifts this bias, leading to expression of astrocytic markers as early as 5days of differentiation, with near complete suppression of neuronal differentiation. The resultant cells express major astrocytic markers, are amenable to co-culture with neurons, can be propagated as astrocyte progenitors and are cryopreservable. Although previous reports have generated astrocytes from pluripotent cells, the differentiation required extensive culture or selection based on cell surface antigens. The development of a label free and rapid differentiation process will expedite future derivation of astrocytes from various sources pluripotent cells including, but not limited to, human astrocytes associated with various neurological diseases.

Abstract: Erythroleukemia is generally associated with a very poor response and survival to current available therapeutic agents. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been described to play a crucial role in the proliferation and differentiation of leukemia cells, this enzyme seems to play an important role in chemoresistance in different cancer types. Previously, we demonstrated that diosgenin, a plant steroid, induced apoptosis in HEL cells with concomitant COX-2 overexpression. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of cyclopamine and jervine, two steroidal alkaloids with similar structures, on HEL and TF1a human erythroleukemia cell lines and, for the first time, their effect on COX-2 expression. Cyclopamine, but not jervine, inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in these cells. Both compounds induced COX-2 overexpression which was responsible for apoptosis resistance. In jervine-treated cells, COX-2 overexpression was NF-κB dependent. Inhibition of NF-κB reduced COX-2 overexpression and induced apoptosis. In addition, cyclopamine induced apoptosis and COX-2 overexpression via PKC activation. Inhibition of the PKC pathway reduced both apoptosis and COX-2 overexpression in both cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the p38/COX-2 pathway was involved in resistance to cyclopamine-induced apoptosis since p38 inhibition reduced COX-2 overexpression and increased apoptosis in both cell lines.

Abstract: Neurons derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have been used to model a variety of neurological disorders. Different protocols have been used to differentiate hiPSCs into neurons, but their functional maturation process has varied greatly among different studies. Here, we demonstrate that laminin, a commonly used substrate for iPSC cultures, was inefficient to promote fully functional maturation of hiPSC-derived neurons. In contrast, astroglial substrate greatly accelerated neurodevelopmental processes of hiPSC-derived neurons. We have monitored the neural differentiation and maturation process for up to two months after plating hiPSC-derived neuroprogenitor cells (hNPCs) on laminin or astrocytes. We found that one week after plating hNPCs, there were 21-fold more newly differentiated neurons on astrocytes than on laminin. Two weeks after plating hNPCs, there were 12-fold more dendritic branches in neurons cultured on astrocytes than on laminin. Six weeks after plating hNPCs, the Na+ and K+ currents, as well as glutamate and GABA receptor currents, were 3-fold larger in neurons cultured on astrocytes than on laminin. And two months after plating hNPCs, the spontaneous synaptic events were 8-fold more in neurons cultured on astrocytes than on laminin. These results highlight a critical role of astrocytes in promoting neural differentiation and functional maturation of human neurons derived from hiPSCs. Moreover, our data presents a thorough developmental timeline of hiPSC-derived neurons in culture, providing important benchmarks for future studies on disease modeling and drug screening.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and are critical for many cellular pathways. Recent evidence has shown that aberrant miRNA expression profiles and unique miRNA signaling pathways are present in many cancers. Here, we demonstrate that miR-29b is markedly lower expressed in CML patient samples. Bioinformatics analysis reveals a conserved target site for miR-29b in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of ABL1. miR-29b significantly suppresses the activity of a luciferase reporter containing ABL1-3′UTR and this activity is not observed in cells transfected with mutated ABL1-3′UTR. Enforced expression of miR-29b in K562 cells inhibits cell growth and colony formation ability thereby inducing apoptosis through cleavage of procaspase 3 and PARP. Furthermore, K562 cells transfected with a siRNA targeting ABL1 show similar growth and apoptosis phenotypes as cells overexpression of miR-29b. Collectively, our results suggest that miR-29b may function as a tumor suppressor by targeting ABL1 and BCR/ABL1.

Abstract: Summary
Cholera toxin (CT), a virulence factor elaborated by Vibrio cholerae, is sufficient to induce the severe diarrhea characteristic of cholera. The enzymatic moiety of CT (CtxA) increases cAMP synthesis in intestinal epithelial cells, leading to chloride ion (Cl−) efflux through the CFTR Cl− channel. To preserve electroneutrality and osmotic balance, sodium ions and water also flow into the intestinal lumen via a paracellular route. We find that CtxA-driven cAMP increase also inhibits Rab11/exocyst-mediated trafficking of host proteins including E-cadherin and Notch signaling components to cell-cell junctions in Drosophila, human intestinal epithelial cells, and ligated mouse ileal loops, thereby disrupting barrier function. Additionally, CtxA induces junctional damage, weight loss, and dye leakage in the Drosophila gut, contributing to lethality from live V. cholerae infection, all of which can be rescued by Rab11 overexpression. These barrier-disrupting effects of CtxA may act in parallel with Cl− secretion to drive the pathophysiology of cholera.

Abstract: Summary
Members of the phylum Apicomplexa actively enter host cells by a process involving the discharge of the apically localized microneme and rhoptry organelles. To unravel the processes involved in rhoptry organelle biogenesis, we focused on the Toxoplasma gondii armadillo repeats only protein (TgARO), a conserved acylated protein homogenously anchored to the rhoptry membrane. Conditional disruption of TgARO results in the random cytosolic dispersion of rhoptries and a severe defect in T. gondii invasion, with no effects on intracellular growth or host cell egress. Importantly, rhoptry displacement upon ARO depletion can be functionally complemented with wild-type TgARO but not an acylation mutant. TgARO interacts with myosin F, and inhibition of actin polymerization or myosin function also results in rhoptry dispersal, indicating that the apical positioning of rhoptries is an actomyosin-based process. Thus, TgARO mediates the apical localization of rhoptries, which is specifically required for host cell invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Imbalance in gut bacterial composition provokes host proinflammatory responses causing diseases such as colitis. Colonization with a mixture of Clostridium species from clusters IV and XIVa was shown to suppress colitis through the induction of IL-10-producing regulatory T (Treg) cells. We demonstrate that a distinct Clostridium strain from cluster I, Clostridium butyricum (CB), prevents acute experimental colitis in mice through induction of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. However, while CB treatment had no effect on IL-10 production by T cells, IL-10-producing F4/80+CD11b+CD11cint macrophages accumulated in the inflamed mucosa after CB treatment. CB directly triggered IL-10 production by intestinal macrophages in inflamed mucosa via the TLR2/MyD88 pathway. The colitis-preventing effect of CB was negated in macrophage-specific IL-10-deficient mice, suggesting that induction of IL-10 by intestinal macrophages is crucial for the probiotic action of CB. Collectively, CB promotes IL-10 production by intestinal macrophages in inflamed mucosa, thereby preventing experimental colitis in mice.

Abstract: Human adipose derived stem cells (hASCs) can be easily isolated and their plasticity has been well characterized. Several TGF-β superfamily ligands can direct hASCs towards chondrocytes. However, these ligands are difficult to purify and expensive. We have developed a library of Activin/BMP2 chimeric ligands (AB2 ligands) by systematically mixing their sequence segments and have tested their chondrogenic potential in hASCs. Cells cultured in monolayer or in a pellet culture system were incubated with a chemically defined medium supplemented with the chimeric ligands for 4 or 6weeks and showed higher expression levels of type II collagen, aggrecan, and Sox9 mRNAs when compared with control and non-treated cells. Moreover, toluidine blue, alcian blue, and Masson's trichrome staining was markedly increased in treated cells, both in cell pellet and monolayer assays. In addition, immunohistochemical staining for detection of type I collagen, type II collagen, and Sox 9 demonstrated the acquisition of a chondrogenic phenotype in both culture systems. We present here an inexpensive and robust protocol for differentiation of hASCs towards chondrocytes in a reproducible and highly efficient manner. The AB2 ligands employed are easily produced and have properties that may become useful in cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum establishes in the host erythrocyte plasma membrane new permeability pathways that mediate nutrient uptake into the infected cell. These pathways simultaneously allow Na+ influx, causing [Na+] in the infected erythrocyte cytosol to increase to high levels. The intraerythrocytic parasite itself maintains a low cytosolic [Na+] via unknown mechanisms. Here we present evidence that the intraerythrocytic parasite actively extrudes Na+ against an inward gradient via PfATP4, a parasite plasma membrane protein with sequence similarities to Na+-ATPases of lower eukaryotes. Mutations in PfATP4 confer resistance to a potent class of antimalarials, the spiroindolones. Consistent with this, the spiroindolones cause a profound disruption in parasite Na+ homeostasis, which is attenuated in parasites bearing resistance-conferring mutations in PfATP4. The mutant parasites also show some impairment of Na+ regulation. Taken together, our results are consistent with PfATP4 being a Na+ efflux ATPase and a target of the spiroindolones.

Abstract: Summary
RNA interference (RNAi) has been extensively used to identify host factors affecting virus infection but requires exogenous delivery of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), thus limiting the technique to nonphysiological infection models and a single defined cell type. We report an alternative screening approach using siRNA delivery via infection with a replication-competent RNA virus. In this system, natural selection, defined by siRNA production, permits the identification of host restriction factors through virus enrichment during a physiological infection. We validate this approach with a large-scale siRNA screen in the context of an in vivo alphavirus infection. Monitoring virus evolution across four independent screens identified two categories of enriched siRNAs: specific effectors of the direct antiviral arsenal and host factors that indirectly dampened the overall antiviral response. These results suggest that pathogenicity may be defined by the ability of the virus to antagonize broad cellular responses and specific antiviral factors.

Abstract: Coronin 1B has been shown to be critical for cell motility and various actin-dependent processes. To understand its role more extensively, the expression and transcriptional regulation of Coro1b gene during mouse development were explored. Coronin 1B is ubiquitously expressed in the whole embryo but nevertheless shows distinct expression pattern in developing heart. In addition to the localization in endocardium, Coronin 1B is specifically expressed in the endocardial cushion and epicardium where cardiac EMT processes take place as the heart develops. Promoter deletion analysis identified the positions between −1038 and −681 is important for Coro1b basal promoter activity. In addition to a correlation of Coronin 1B localization with Wt1 expression in the epicardium, we also identified putative Wt1 binding sequences within Coro1b promoter. Direct binding of Wt1 to GC-rich sequences within the Coro1b promoter is required for the regulation of Coro1b gene expression. In accordance with the motility defect found in Coronin 1B-knockdown cells, a modest decrease in expression of Coronin 1B in the remaining epicardium of Wt1EGFPCre/EGFPCre mutant embryos was observed. These findings seem to shed light on the role of Wt1 during cell migration and suggest that, at least in part, this involves transcriptional control of Coro1b gene expression.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are thought to originate from the electrically active pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Despite the presence of synaptic-like vesicles and proteins involved in cell secretion it remains unclear whether GIST cells possess regulated release mechanisms. The GIST tumor cell line GIST882 was used as a model cell system, and stimulus-release coupling was investigated by confocal microscopy of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), flow cytometry, and luminometric measurements of extracellular ATP. We demonstrate that GIST cells have an intact intracellular Ca2+-signaling pathway that regulates ATP release. Cell viability and cell membrane integrity was preserved, excluding ATP leakage due to cell death and suggesting active ATP release. The stimulus-secretion signal transduction is at least partly dependent on Ca2+ influx since exclusion of extracellular Ca2+ diminishes the ATP release. We conclude that measurements of ATP release in GISTs may be a useful tool for dissecting the signal transduction pathway, mapping exocytotic components, and possibly for the development and evaluation of drugs. Additionally, release of ATP from GISTs may have importance for tumor tissue homeostasis and immune surveillance escape.

Abstract: The developmental pathway that gives rise to mature adipocytes involves commitment and terminal differentiation. Our previous findings indicate that BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4) induces nearly complete commitment of C3H10T1/2 pluripotent stem cells to the adipocyte lineage and knockdown of lysyl oxidase (Lox) disrupts this commitment process. Here, we found that an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like response is required for adipocyte lineage commitment and that Lox is indispensable for this process. When C3H10T1/2 cells were treated with BMP4, Vim and Cdh2 showed up-regulated expression while Cdh1 and Ocln were down-regulated along with enhanced cell migration, which are EMT-like responses. Silencing of Lox in BMP4-treated C3H10T1/2 cells induced a mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET)-like response associated with the repression of mesenchymal markers, induction of epithelial markers and decreased cell migration. Importantly, blocking the EMT-like response by knocking down Cdh2 or over-expression of Cdh1 impairs adipocyte lineage commitment. EMT is regulated by distinct transcription factors such as Snai1, Snai2 and Twist. In this study, we also found that only Twist was down-regulated after Lox silencing in C3H10T1/2 cells treated with BMP4. This study provides new insights into adipocyte lineage commitment.

Abstract: Upon activation of human neutrophils, superoxide can be produced at two cellular sites; either in the plasma membrane, giving extracellular release of oxidants, or in intracellular organelles, resulting in oxidants being retained in the cell. The involvement of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced activation of the two pools of NADPH-oxidase was investigated using a variety of PLA2 inhibitors and the oxidase activity was measured by luminol/isoluminol-amplified chemiluminescence (CL). Two of the seven inhibitors were without effect, two inhibitors inhibited both intra- and extracellular ROS production equally, and three inhibitors inhibited intracellular but not extracellular CL. Using another technique to measure ROS, PHPA oxidation, we found that intracellular ROS production was unaltered with the three last inhibitors, indicating that PLA2 is not involved in the NADPH-oxidase activity per se, but in the intracellular processing of the radicals necessary for the CL reaction to take place. The PLA2 inhibitors did not abolish the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme necessary for intracellular CL to occur. Instead, we suggest that these PLA2 inhibitors block heterotypic granule fusion and prohibit the colocalization of ROS and MPO needed for intracellular CL activity.

Abstract: The abnormal proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in arterial wall is a major cause of vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty. In this study, we investigated not only the inhibitory effects of camptothecin (CPT) on PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation, but also its molecular mechanism of this inhibition. CPT significantly inhibited proliferation with IC50 value of 0.58 μM and the DNA synthesis of PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMCs in a dose-dependent manner (0.5–2μM ) without any cytotoxicity. CPT induced the cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Also, CPT decreased the expressions of G0/G1-specific regulatory proteins including cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2, cyclin D1 and PCNA in PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMCs. Pre-incubation of VSMCs with CPT significantly inhibited PDGF-BB-induced Akt activation, whereas CPT did not affect PDGF-receptor beta phosphorylation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation and phospholipase C (PLC)-γ1 phosphorylation in PDGF-BB signaling pathway. Our data showed that CPT pre-treatment inhibited VSMC proliferation, and that the inhibitory effect of CPT was enhanced by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, on PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation. In addition, inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002 significantly enhanced the suppression of PCNA expression and Akt activation by CPT. These results suggest that the anti-proliferative activity of CPT is mediated in part by downregulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Abstract: Genomic damage may devastate the potential of progenitor cells and consequently impair early organogenesis. We found that ogg1, a key enzyme initiating the base-excision repair, was enriched in the embryonic heart in zebrafish. So far, little is known about DNA repair in cardiogenesis. Here, we addressed the critical role of ogg1 in cardiogenesis for the first time. ogg1 mainly expressed in the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM), the primary heart tube, and subsequently the embryonic myocardium by in situ hybridisation. Loss of ogg1 resulted in severe cardiac morphogenesis and functional abnormalities, including the short heart length, arrhythmia, decreased cardiomyocytes and nkx2.5+ cardiac progenitor cells. Moreover, the increased apoptosis and repressed proliferation of progenitor cells caused by ogg1 deficiency might contribute to the heart phenotype. The microarray analysis showed that the expression of genes involved in embryonic heart tube morphogenesis and heart structure were significantly changed due to the lack of ogg1. Among those, foxh1 is an important partner of ogg1 in the cardiac development in response to DNA damage. Our work demonstrates the requirement of ogg1 in cardiac progenitors and heart development in zebrafish. These findings may be helpful for understanding the aetiology of congenital cardiac deficits.

Abstract: In this study, mesenchymal stem cells deriving from dental pulp (DPSCs) of normal human impacted third molars, previously characterized for their ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, were used. We observed that: i) DPSCs, undifferentiated or submitted to osteogenic differentiation, express all four subtypes of adenosine receptors (AR) and CD73, corresponding to 5′-ecto-nucleotidase; and ii) AR stimulation with selective agonists elicited a greater osteogenic cell differentiation consequent to A1 receptor (A1R) activation. Therefore, we focused on the activity of this AR. The addition of 15–60nM 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyl-adenosine (CCPA), A1R agonist, to DPSCs at each change of the culture medium significantly increased the proliferation of cells grown in osteogenic medium after 8days in vitro (DIV) without modifying that of undifferentiated DPSCs. Better characterizing the effect of A1R stimulation on the osteogenic differentiation capability of these cells, we found that CCPA increased the: i) expression of two well known and early osteogenic markers, RUNX-2 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), after 3 and 7DIV; ii) ALP enzyme activity at 7DIV and iii) mineralization of extracellular matrix after 21DIV. These effects, abolished by cell pre-treatment with the A1R antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropyl-xanthine (DPCPX), involved the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling as, in differentiating DPSCs, CCPA significantly increased dishevelled protein and inhibited glycogen synthase kinase-3β, both molecules being downstream of Wnt receptor signal pathway. Either siRNA of dishevelled or cell pre-treatment with Dickkopf-1, known inhibitor of Wnt signaling substantially reduced either DPSC osteogenic differentiation or its enhancement promoted by CCPA. Summarizing, our findings indicate that the stimulation of A1R may stimulate DPSC duplication enhancing their osteogenic differentiation efficiency. These effects may have clinical implications possibly facilitating bone tissue repair and remodeling.

Abstract: Numerous epidemiological studies have established acute brain injury as one of the major risk factors for the Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the lack of animal models of AD-like degeneration triggered by a defined injury hampered the development of adequate therapies. Here we report that the surgical damage of the olfactory bulbs triggers the development of several pathologies, including amyloid-β accumulation and strong decrease of neuron density in the cortex and hippocampus as well as significant disturbance of spatial memory. Characteristically, these harmful consequences of the olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) have a peculiar dynamics in time with maximal manifestation in periods of 1–1.5 months and 8 months after the surgery and, hence, exhibit biphasic pattern with almost complete recovery period taking place at 5–6 months after the operation. The quantitative determination of endogenous inducible form of Hsp70 in different brain areas of OBX mice demonstrated characteristic fluctuations of Hsp70 levels depending on the time after the operation and age of mice. Interestingly, maximal induction of Hsp70 synthesis in the hippocampus exhibits clear-cut coincidence with the recovery period in OBX animals. The observed correlation enables to suggest curing effect of Hsp70 synthesis at an earlier period of pathology development and establishes it as a possible therapeutic agent for secondary grave consequences of brain injury, such as AD-like degeneration, for which neuroprotective therapy is urgently needed.

Abstract: The Mediterranean land snail Xeropicta derbentina forms huge populations in Southern France. In order to characterize heat exposure and the induction of the 70-kD heat shock protein (Hsp70) response system during the life cycle of this snail, a selected population from the Vaucluse area, Provence, was investigated encompassing the issues of morphological life cycle parameters (shell size and colouration), the daily courses of heat exposure at different heights above the ground, of shell temperature, and that of the individual Hsp70 levels. The study covered all four seasons of the year 2011. Snails were found to be annual, reaching their final size in August. The shell colouration pattern showed high variation in juveniles (spring) with a strong tendency towards becoming uniformly white at old age in autumn. In all seasons, ambient air temperature decreased with increasing distance from the ground surface during daytime while remaining constantly low in the night. Overall, the Hsp70 level of individuals followed the ambient temperature during diurnal and seasonal variations. Correlation analysis revealed a positive association of individual shell temperature and Hsp70 level for the most part of the life cycle of the snails until late summer, whereas a negative correlation was found for aged animals indicating senescence effects on the capacity of the stress response system.

Abstract: Decrease in expression of the tumor suppressor microRNA-138 (miR-138) correlates well with an increase in telomerase activity in many human cancers. The ability of almost all human cancer cells to grow indefinitely is dependent on presence of telomerase activity. The catalytic component of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) regulates telomerase activity in most of the human cancers including malignant neuroblastoma. We observed an indirect increase in the expression of miR-138 after the transfection with hTERT short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmid in human malignant neuroblastoma SK-N-DZ and SK-N-BE2 cell lines. Transfection with hTERT shRNA plasmid followed by treatment with the flavonoid apigenin (APG) further increased expression of miR-138. Direct transfection with miR-138 mimic was more powerful than transfection with hTERT shRNA plasmid in potentiating efficacy of APG for decreasing cell viability and colony formation capability of both cell lines. Upregulation of miR-138 was also more effective than down regulation of hTERT in enhancing efficacy of APG for induction of apoptosis in malignant neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. We delineated that apoptosis occurred with induction of molecular components of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in SK-N-DZ and SK-N-BE2 cells both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that direct miR-138 overexpression is more powerful than hTERT down regulation in enhancing pro-apoptotic effect of APG for controlling growth of human malignant neuroblastoma in cell culture and animal models.

Abstract: The efficient production of human neocortical neurons from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) is the primary requirement for studying early stages of human cortical development. We used hESC to obtain radial glial cells (hESC-RG) and then compared them with RG cells isolated from human fetal forebrain. Fate of hESC-RG cells critically depends on intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The expression of Pax6 (intrinsic factor) has a similar neurogenic effect on hESC-RG differentiation as reported for human fetal RG cells. Factors from the microenvironment also play a significant role in determining hESC-RG cell fate. In contrast to control cultures, wherein hESC-RG generate mainly astroglia and far fewer neurons, in co-cultures with human fetal forebrain cells, the reverse was found to be true. This neurogenic effect was partly due to soluble factors from human fetal brain cultures. The detected shift towards neurogenesis has significance for developing future efficient neuro-differentiation protocols. Importantly, we established that hESC-RG cells are similar in many respects to human fetal RG cells, including their proliferative capacity, neurogenic potential, and ability to generate various cortical neuronal sub-types. Unlike fetal RG cells, the hESC-RG cells are readily available and can be standardized, features that have considerable practical advantages in research and clinics.

Abstract: Summary
Several human APOBEC3 deaminases can inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro. HIV-1 Vif counteracts this restriction by targeting APOBEC3 for proteasomal degradation. Human APOBEC3H (A3H) is highly polymorphic, with natural variants differing considerably in anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro. To examine HIV-1 adaptation to variation in A3H activity in a natural infection context, we determined the A3H haplotypes and Vif sequences from 76 recently infected HIV-1 patients. We detected A3H-specific Vif changes suggesting viral adaptation. The patient-derived Vif sequences were used to engineer viruses that specifically differed in their ability to counteract A3H. Replication of these Vif-variant viruses in primary T cells naturally expressing active or inactive A3H haplotypes showed that endogenously expressed A3H restricts HIV-1 replication. Proviral DNA from A3H-restricted viruses showed high levels of G-to-A mutations in an A3H-specific GA dinucleotide context. Taken together, our data validate A3H expressed at endogenous levels as a bona fide HIV-1 restriction factor.

Abstract: Summary
After invading host cells, Toxoplasma gondii multiplies within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that is maintained by parasite proteins secreted from organelles called dense granules. Most dense granule proteins remain within the PV, and few are known to access the host cell cytosol. We identify GRA16 as a dense granule protein that is exported through the PV membrane and reaches the host cell nucleus, where it positively modulates genes involved in cell-cycle progression and the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. GRA16 binds two host enzymes, the deubiquitinase HAUSP and PP2A phosphatase, which exert several functions, including regulation of p53 and the cell cycle. GRA16 alters p53 levels in a HAUSP-dependent manner and induces nuclear translocation of the PP2A holoenzyme. Additionally, certain GRA16-deficient strains exhibit attenuated virulence, indicating the importance of these host alterations in pathogenesis. Therefore, GRA16 represents a potentially emerging subfamily of exported dense granule proteins that modulate host function.

Abstract: Summary
The indigenous microbiota of the nasal cavity plays important roles in human health and disease. Patterns of spatial variation in microbiota composition may help explain Staphylococcus aureus colonization and reveal interspecies and species-host interactions. To assess the biogeography of the nasal microbiota, we sampled healthy subjects, representing both S. aureus carriers and noncarriers at three nasal sites (anterior naris, middle meatus, and sphenoethmoidal recess). Phylogenetic compositional and sparse linear discriminant analyses revealed communities that differed according to site epithelium type and S. aureus culture-based carriage status. Corynebacterium accolens and C. pseudodiphtheriticum were identified as the most important microbial community determinants of S. aureus carriage, and competitive interactions were only evident at sites with ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. In vitro cocultivation experiments provided supporting evidence of interactions among these species. These results highlight spatial variation in nasal microbial communities and differences in community composition between S. aureus carriers and noncarriers.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial exposure following birth profoundly impacts mammalian immune system development. Microbiota alterations are associated with increased incidence of allergic and autoimmune disorders with elevated serum IgE as a hallmark. The previously reported abnormally high serum IgE levels in germ-free mice suggests that immunoregulatory signals from microbiota are required to control basal IgE levels. We report that germ-free mice and those with low-diversity microbiota develop elevated serum IgE levels in early life. B cells in neonatal germ-free mice undergo isotype switching to IgE at mucosal sites in a CD4 T-cell- and IL-4-dependent manner. A critical level of microbial diversity following birth is required in order to inhibit IgE induction. Elevated IgE levels in germ-free mice lead to increased mast-cell-surface-bound IgE and exaggerated oral-induced systemic anaphylaxis. Thus, appropriate intestinal microbial stimuli during early life are critical for inducing an immunoregulatory network that protects from induction of IgE at mucosal sites.

Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1/3 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) activation are involved in the apoptotic response triggered by a chimeric cyclic peptide of the interferon-α2b (IFN-α2b) in WISH cells. Since the peptide also induced serine phosphorylation of STAT proteins, in the present study we examined the kinase involved in serine STAT1 phosphorylation and the signaling effectors acting upstream such activation. We first found that p38 MAPK is involved in serine STAT1 phosphorylation, since a reduction of phophoserine-STAT1 levels was evident after incubating WISH cells with cyclic peptide in the presence of a p38 pharmacological inhibitor or a dominant-negative p38 mutant. Next, we demonstrated that the peptide induced activation of protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ). Based on this finding, the role of this kinase was then evaluated. After incubating WISH cells with a PKCδ inhibitor or after decreasing PKCδ expression levels by RNA interference, both peptide-induced serine STAT1 and p38 phosphorylation levels were significantly decreased, indicating that PKCδ functions as an upstream regulator of p38. We also showed that PKCδ and p38 activation stimulated by the peptide was inhibited by a specific pharmacological inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or by a dominant-negative p85 PI3K-regulatory subunit, suggesting that PI3K is upstream in the signaling cascade. In addition, the role of PI3K and PKCδ in cyclic peptide-induced apoptosis was examined. Both signaling effectors were found to regulate the antiproliferative activity and the apoptotic response triggered by the cyclic peptide in WISH cells. In conclusion, we herein demonstrated that STAT1 serine phosphorylation is mediated by the sequential activation of PI3K, PKCδ and p38 MAPK. This signaling cascade contributes to the antitumor effect induced by the chimeric IFN-α2b cyclic peptide in WISH cells.

Abstract: The activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the subsequent overexpression of its downstream targets transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and fibronectin (FN) are among the hallmarks for the progressive diabetic nephropathy. Our previous studies demonstrated that emodin ameliorated renal injury and inhibited extracellular matrix accumulation in kidney and mesangial cells under diabetic condition. However, the molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here, we showed that emodin significantly attenuated high glucose-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation in mesangial cells. Interestingly, emodin also inhibited the DNA-binding activity and transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Furthermore, NF-κB-mediated TGF-β1 and FN expression was significantly decreased by emodin. These results demonstrated that emodin suppressed TGF-β1 and FN overexpression through inhibition of NF-κB activation, suggesting that emodin-mediated inhibition of the NF-κB pathway could protect against diabetic nephropathy.

Abstract: Application of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) to cells epigenetically alters their chromatin structure and induces transcriptional and cellular reparative events. This study investigated the application of two HDACi, valproic acid (VPA) and trichostatin A (TSA) on the induction of repair-associated responses in primary dental pulp cell (DPC) cultures. Flow cytometry demonstrated that TSA (100nM, 400nM) significantly increased cell viability. Neither HDACi was cytotoxic, although cell growth analysis revealed significant anti-proliferative effects at higher concentrations for VPA (>0.5mM) and TSA (>50nM). While high-content-analysis demonstrated that HDACi did not significantly induce caspase-3 or p21 activity, p53-expression was increased by VPA (3mM, 5mM) at 48h. HDACi-exposure induced mineralization per cell dose-dependently to a plateau level (VPA-0.125mM and TSA-25nM) with accompanying increases in mineralization/dentinogenic-associated gene expression at 5 days (DMP-1, BMP-2/-4, Nestin) and 10 days (DSPP, BMP-2/-4). Both HDACis, at a range of concentrations, significantly stimulated osteopontin and BMP-2 protein expression at 10 and 14 days further supporting the ability of HDACi to promote differentiation. HDACi exert different effects on primary compared with transformed DPCs and promote mineralization and differentiation events without cytotoxic effects. These novel data now highlight the potential in restorative dentistry for applying low concentrations of HDACi in vital pulp treatment.

Abstract: Tar-DNA binding protein of 43kDa (TDP-43) has been characterized as a major component of protein aggregates in brains with neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, physiological roles of TDP-43 and early cellular pathogenic effects caused by disease associated mutations in differentiated neurons are still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the physiological roles of TDP-43 and the effects of missense mutations associated with diseases in differentiated cortical neurons. The reduction of TDP-43 by siRNA increased abnormal neurites and decreased cell viability. ALS/FTLD-associated missense mutant proteins (A315T, Q331K, and M337V) were partially mislocalized to the cytosol and neurites when compared to wild-type and showed abnormal neurites similar to those observed in cases of loss of TDP-43. Interestingly, cytosolic expression of wild-type TDP-43 with mutated nuclear localization signals also induced abnormal neurtie morphology and reduction of cell viability. However, there was no significant difference in the effects of cytosolic expression in neuronal morphology and cell toxicity between wild-type and missense mutant proteins. Thus, our results suggest that mislocalization of missense mutant TDP-43 may contribute to loss of TDP-43 function and affect neuronal morphology, probably via dominant negative action before severe neurodegeneration in differentiated cortical neurons.

Abstract: MUPP-1 (multi-PDZ domain protein-1) and PATJ (PALS-1-associated tight junction protein) proteins are closely related scaffold proteins and bind to many common interactors including PALS-1 (protein associated with Lin seven) a member of the Crumbs complex. Our goal is to understand how MUPP-1 and PATJ and their interaction with PALS-1 are regulated in the same cells. We have shown that in MCF10A cells there are at least two different and co-existing complexes, PALS-1/MUPP-1 and PALS-1/PATJ. Surprisingly, MUPP-1 levels inversely correlated with PATJ protein levels by acting on the stabilization of the PATJ/PALS-1 complex. Upon MUPP-1 depletion, the increased amounts of PATJ are in part localized at the migrating front of MCF10A cells and are able to recruit more PAR3 (partition defective 3). All together these data indicate that a precise balance between MUPP-1 and PATJ is achieved in epithelial cells by regulating their association with PALS-1.

Abstract: Summary
After replicating in epithelial cells, alphaherpesviruses such as pseudorabies virus (PRV) invade axons of peripheral nervous system neurons and undergo retrograde transport toward the distant cell bodies. Although several viral proteins engage molecular motors to facilitate transport, the initial steps and neuronal responses to infection are poorly understood. Using compartmented neuron cultures to physically separate axon infection from cell bodies, we found that PRV infection induces local protein synthesis in axons, including proteins involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, intracellular trafficking, signaling, and metabolism. This rapid translation of axonal mRNAs is required for efficient PRV retrograde transport and infection of cell bodies. Furthermore, induction of axonal damage, which also induces local protein synthesis, prior to infection reduces virion trafficking, suggesting that host damage signals and virus particles compete for retrograde transport. Thus, similar to axonal damage, virus infection induces local protein translation in axons, and viruses likely exploit this response for invasion.

Abstract: Homers are scaffolding proteins that modulate diverse cell functions being able to assemble signalling complexes. In this study, the presence, sub-cellular distribution and function of Homer 1 was investigated. Homer 1a and Homer 1b/c are constitutively expressed in cardiac muscle of both mouse and rat and in HL-1 cells, a cardiac cell line. As judged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, Homer 1a displays sarcomeric and peri-nuclear localization. In cardiomyocytes and cultured HL-1 cells, the hypertrophic agonist norepinephrine (NE) induces α1-adrenergic specific Homer 1a over-expression, with a two-to-three-fold increase within 1h, and no up-regulation of Homer 1b/c, as judged by Western blot and qPCR. In HL-1 cells, plasmid-driven over-expression of Homer 1a partially antagonizes activation of ERK phosphorylation and ANF up-regulation, two well-established, early markers of hypertrophy. At the morphometric level, NE-induced increase of cell size is likewise and partially counteracted by exogenous Homer 1a. Under the same experimental conditions, Homer 1b/c does not have any effect on ANF up-regulation nor on cell hypertrophy. Thus, Homer 1a up-regulation is associated to early stages of cardiac hypertrophy and appears to play a negative feedback regulation on molecular transducers of hypertrophy.

Abstract: Tumor cells often exhibit an altered metabolic phenotype. However, it is unclear as to when this switch takes place in ovarian cancer, and the potential for these changes to serve as therapeutic targets in clinical prevention and intervention trials. We used our recently developed and characterized mouse ovarian surface epithelial (MOSE) cancer progression model to study metabolic changes in distinct disease stages. As ovarian cancer progresses, complete oxidation of glucose and fatty acids were significantly decreased, concurrent with increases in lactate excretion and 3H-deoxyglucose uptake by the late-stage cancer cells, shifting the cells towards a more glycolytic phenotype. These changes were accompanied by decreases in TCA flux but an increase in citrate synthase activity, providing substrates for de novo fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Also, uncoupled maximal respiration rates in mitochondria decreased as cancer progressed. Treatment of the MOSE cells with 1.5μM sphingosine, a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, decreased citrate synthase activity, increased TCA flux, decreased cholesterol synthesis and glycolysis. Together, our data confirm metabolic changes during ovarian cancer progression, indicate a stage specificity of these changes, and suggest that multiple events in cellular metabolism are targeted by exogenous sphingosine which may be critical for future prevention trials.

Abstract: Summary
The spontaneous transition of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from latency to productive infection is infrequent, making its analysis in the resulting mixed cell populations difficult. We engineered cells to support this transition efficiently and developed EBV DNA variants that could be visualized and measured as fluorescent signals over multiple cell cycles. This approach revealed that EBV’s productive replication began synchronously for viral DNAs within a cell but asynchronously between cells. EBV DNA amplification was delayed until early S phase and occurred in factories characterized by the absence of cellular DNA and histones, by a sequential redistribution of PCNA, and by localization away from the nuclear periphery. The earliest amplified DNAs lacked histones accompanying a decline in four histone chaperones. Thus, EBV transits from being dependent on the cellular replication machinery during latency to commandeering both that machinery and nuclear structure for its own reproductive needs.

Abstract: Ependymal cells in the lateral ventricular wall are considered to be post-mitotic but can give rise to neuroblasts and astrocytes after stroke in adult mice due to insult-induced suppression of Notch signaling. The transcription factor FoxJ1, which has been used to characterize mouse ependymal cells, is also expressed by a subset of astrocytes. Cells expressing FoxJ1, which drives the expression of motile cilia, contribute to early postnatal neurogenesis in mouse olfactory bulb. The distribution and progeny of FoxJ1-expressing cells in rat forebrain are unknown. Here we show using immunohistochemistry that the overall majority of FoxJ1-expressing cells in the lateral ventricular wall of adult rats are ependymal cells with a minor population being astrocytes. To allow for long-term fate mapping of FoxJ1-derived cells, we used the piggyBac system for in vivo gene transfer with electroporation. Using this method, we found that FoxJ1-expressing cells, presumably the astrocytes, give rise to neuroblasts and mature neurons in the olfactory bulb both in intact and stroke-damaged brain of adult rats. No significant contribution of FoxJ1-derived cells to stroke-induced striatal neurogenesis was detected. These data indicate that in the adult rat brain, FoxJ1-expressing cells contribute to the formation of new neurons in the olfactory bulb but are not involved in the cellular repair after stroke.

Abstract: The AKT and ERK signaling pathways are known to be involved in cell hypertrophy, proliferation, survival and differentiation. Although there is evidence for crosstalk between these two signaling pathways in cellulo, there is less evidence for cross talk in vivo. Here, we show that crosstalk between AKT and ERK signaling in the hearts of TRIM72-overexpressing transgenic mice (TRIM72-Tg) with alpha-MHC promoter regulates and maintains their heart size. TRIM72, a heart- and skeletal muscle-specific protein, downregulates AKT-mTOR signaling via IRS-1 degradation and reduces the size of rat cardiomyocytes and the size of postnatal TRIM72-Tg hearts. TRIM72 expression was upregulated by hypertrophic inducers in cardiomyocytes, while IRS-1 was downregulated by IGF-1. TRIM72 specifically regulated IGF-1-dependent AKT-mTOR signaling, resulting in a reduction of the size of cardiomyocytes. Postnatal TRIM72-Tg hearts were smaller than control-treated hearts with inhibition of AKT-mTOR signaling. However, adult TRIM72-Tg hearts were larger than of control despite the suppression of AKT-mTOR signaling. Activation of ERK, PKC-α, and JNK were observed to be elevated in adult TRIM72-Tg, and these signals were mediated by ET-1 via the ET receptors A and B. Altogether, these results suggest that AKT signaling regulates cardiac hypertrophy in physiological conditions, and ERK signaling compensates for the absence of AKT signaling during TRIM72 overexpression, leading to pathological hypertrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils mediate bacterial clearance through various mechanisms, including the release of mesh-like DNA structures or neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that capture bacteria. Although neutrophils are also recruited to sites of viral infection, their role in antiviral innate immunity is less clear. We show that systemic administration of virus analogs or poxvirus infection induces neutrophil recruitment to the liver microvasculature and the release of NETs that protect host cells from virus infection. After systemic intravenous poxvirus challenge, mice exhibit thrombocytopenia and the recruitment of both neutrophils and platelets to the liver vasculature. Circulating platelets interact with, roll along, and adhere to the surface of adherent neutrophils, forming large, dynamic aggregates. These interactions facilitate the release of NETs within the liver vasculature that are able to protect host cells from poxvirus infection. These findings highlight the role of NETs and early tissue-wide responses in preventing viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
Placental malaria (PM) is a major cause of fetal growth restriction, yet the underlying mechanism is unclear. Complement C5a and C5a receptor levels are increased with PM. C5a is implicated in fetal growth restriction in non-infection-based animal models. In a case-control study of 492 pregnant Malawian women, we find that elevated C5a levels are associated with an increased risk of delivering a small-for-gestational-age infant. C5a was significantly increased in PM and was negatively correlated with the angiogenic factor angiopoietin-1 and positively correlated with angiopoietin-2, soluble endoglin, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of C5a or its receptor in a mouse model of PM resulted in greater fetoplacental vessel development, reduced placental vascular resistance, and improved fetal growth and survival. These data suggest that C5a drives fetal growth restriction in PM through dysregulation of angiogenic factors essential for placental vascular remodeling resulting in placental vascular insufficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying molecular targets of Yersinia virulence effectors, or Yops, during animal infection is challenging because few cells are targeted by Yops in an infected organ, and isolating these sparse effector-containing cells is difficult. YopH, a tyrosine phosphatase, is essential for full virulence of Yersinia. Investigating the YopH-targeted signal transduction pathway(s) in neutrophils during infection of a murine host, we find that several host proteins, including the essential signaling adaptor SLP-76, are dephosphorylated in the presence of YopH in neutrophils isolated from infected tissues. YopH inactivated PRAM-1/SKAP-HOM and the SLP-76/Vav/PLCγ2 signal transduction axes, leading to an inhibition of calcium response in isolated neutrophils. Consistent with a failure to mount a calcium response, IL-10 production was reduced in neutrophils containing YopH from infected tissues. Finally, a yopH mutant survived better in the absence of neutrophils, indicating that neutrophil inactivation by YopH by targeting PRAM-1/SKAP-HOM and SLP-76/Vav/PLCγ2 signaling hubs may be critical for Yersinia survival.
