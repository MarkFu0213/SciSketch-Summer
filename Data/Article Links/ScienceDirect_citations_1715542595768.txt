Abstract: Neurons require adhesive scaffolds for their growth and differentiation. Laminins are a major cell adhesive component of basement membranes and have various biological activities in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Here, we evaluated the biological activities of 5 peptides derived from laminin-111 as a scaffold for mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells and rat neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs). The 5 peptides showed Neuro2a cell attachment activity similar to that of poly-d-lysine. However, when NPCs were cultured on the peptides, 2 syndecan-binding peptides, AG73 (RKRLQVQLSIRT, mouse laminin α1 chain 2719-2730) and C16 (KAFDITYVRLKF, laminin γ1 chain 139–150), demonstrated significantly higher cell attachment and neurite extension activities than other peptides including integrin-binding ones. Long-term cell culture experiments showed that both AG73 and C16 supported the growth of neurons and astrocytes that had differentiated from NPCs. Furthermore, C16 markedly promoted the expression of neuronal markers such as synaptosomal-associated protein-25 and syntaxin 1A. These results indicate that AG73 and C16 are useful for NPC cultures and that C16 can be applied to specialized research on synapses in differentiated neurons. These peptides have the potential for use as valuable biomaterials for NPC research.

Abstract: DNA methylation alters the expression of certain genes without any alteration to the DNA sequence and is a dynamic process during normal hematopoietic differentiation. As an epigenetic regulator, methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) is an important member of the MBD protein family and is acknowledged as a “reader” of DNA methylation. We used a mouse model to study the effects of MBD2 on the early development of T cells. Here, we found that MBD2 deficiency led to retardation of T cell differentiation at the DN3 stage. Meanwhile, decreased proliferative capacity and increased apoptosis were detected in Mbd2−/− DN thymocytes. Furthermore, we found the WNT pathway was significantly down-regulated in Mbd2−/− DN thymocytes: DKK1 (Dickkopf-1) expression was significantly increased, while TCF7 (transcription factor 7) and c-MYC were down-regulated. Thus, these findings established that MBD2 acted as a dominant regulator to imprint DN T cell development via the WNT pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Many diseases are caused by toxic RNA repeats. Herein, we designed a lead small molecule that binds the structure of the r(CUG) repeat expansion [r(CUG)exp] that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and rescues disease biology in patient-derived cells and in vivo. Interestingly, the compound's downstream effects are different in the two diseases, owing to the location of the repeat expansion. In DM1, r(CUG)exp is harbored in the 3′ untranslated region, and the compound has no effect on the mRNA's abundance. In FECD, however, r(CUG)exp is located in an intron, and the small molecule facilitates excision of the intron, which is then degraded by the RNA exosome complex. Thus, structure-specific, RNA-targeting small molecules can act disease specifically to affect biology, either by disabling the gain-of-function mechanism (DM1) or by stimulating quality control pathways to rid a disease-affected cell of a toxic RNA (FECD).

Abstract: Summary
Polymorphisms in MHC-I protein sequences across human populations significantly affect viral peptide binding capacity, and thus alter T cell immunity to infection. In the present study, we assess the relationship between observed SARS-CoV-2 population mortality and the predicted viral binding capacities of 52 common MHC-I alleles. Potential SARS-CoV-2 MHC-I peptides are identified using a consensus MHC-I binding and presentation prediction algorithm called EnsembleMHC. Starting with nearly 3.5 million candidates, we resolve a few hundred highly probable MHC-I peptides. By weighing individual MHC allele-specific SARS-CoV-2 binding capacity with population frequency in 23 countries, we discover a strong inverse correlation between predicted population SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding capacity and mortality rate. Our computations reveal that peptides derived from the structural proteins of the virus produce a stronger association with observed mortality rate, highlighting the importance of S, N, M, and E proteins in driving productive immune responses.

Abstract: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is the root cause of many musculoskeletal disorders of the spine. However, the etiology of IDD is complex and still not well understood. Animal models of IDD would be useful in deciphering the underlying mechanisms. But the existing animal models have their limitations. Therefore, to establish a novel mouse model that can simulate the human IDD process in vivo, we proposed to carefully circumcise the 2 mm-wide tail skin and then compressively sutured the defect with a simple end-to-end suture to exert excessive pressure on the disc. After 1-week, 2-week, and 4-week compression, the mice were sacrificed and the intervertebral discs were harvested for tissue analysis. The radiological, morphological, and molecular modifications of intervertebral discs were measured to characterize this model. Radiologically, the water content of the intervertebral disc decreased significantly after 2-week compression. Morphologically, the nucleus pulposus showed a decrease in volume and the number of notochordal cells. The compressive suture also broke the balance between anabolic and catabolic enzymes in nucleus pulposus, which led to the remodeling of the extracellular matrix in nucleus pulposus as the content of aggrecan and collagen II decreased. The compressive suture could induce intervertebral discs degeneration in a more reasonable way, which was solely influenced by mechanical loading, as the mice caudal vertebrae still moved freely after the operation. This kind of animal model could be adapted as a reliable in vivo mouse IDD model for the research regarding the etiology and treatments of IDD.

Abstract: LncRNA embryonic stem cells expressed 1 (Lncenc1), named after its high expression in naïve embryonic stem cells (nESCs), has been rarely studied in almost all pathological processes. Evidences suggest that Lncenc1 is likely to work in the form of RNA-protein complex. Here, we found that Lncenc1 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was significantly upregulated in response to mouse nerve injury caused by partial sciatic nerve ligation (pSNL). Overexpression of Lncenc1 mediated by adenoviral expression vector promoted the activation of microglia and the production of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β and MCP-1. In contrast, knockdown of Lncenc1 suppressed activation of microglia and production of inflammatory cytokines. In the mechanism exploration, we found that Lncenc1 could bind with the RNA binding protein (RBP) enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), an identified contributor in microglial activation and neuropathic pain. Lncenc1 interacted with EZH2 and downregulated the expression of brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1). Either inhibition of EZH2 or overexpression of BAI1 could reverse the effects of Lncenc1 overexpression on microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Finally, the Lncenc1-siRNA was intrathecally injected into pSNL mice, and its effects on neuropathic pain were evaluated. Knockdown of Lncenc1 attenuated the development and maintenance of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia of pSNL mice, accompanied by an increase in BAI1 expression and decrease in inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, Lncenc1 contributes to neuropathic pain by interacting with EZH2 and downregulating the BAI1 gene in mouse microglia.

Abstract: Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is one of the most common cancers in the oral cavity. Notch signaling is frequently dysregulated in cancer. However, the role of Notch2 in TSCC is not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of abnormal expression of Notch2 in TSCC. The expression of Notch2 was tested in 47 pairs of tissues from tongue cancer and normal samples by using immunohistochemical staining. Tongue cancer cells were transfected with siRNA or plasmid. The proliferation of the cells was tested by the CCK8 assay and colony formation assay. Subcutaneous tumor model was established to observe tumor growth. Transwell assay was used to detect the changes of cell migration and invasion ability. A humanized anti-Notch2 antibody was used to TSCC cells. We found that Notch2 was upregulated in tongue carcinoma tissues. Knocking down the expression of Notch2 by siRNA in the TSCC cell lines decreased proliferation ability both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, migration and invasion abilities were inhibited by knockdown of Notch2 in the TSCC cells. However, overexpression of Notch2 increased tongue cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration. The humanized anti-Notch2 antibody inhibited TSCC cell growth. The results indicated that Notch2 is an oncogene in tongue squamous cell carcinoma and may become the target of a new approach for treating TSCC.

Abstract: Aims/hypothesis
MicroRNA-21 has been implicated in diabetic complication, including diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, there is limited information regarding the biological role of the miR-21 passenger strand (miR-21–3p) in diabetic cardiac fibrosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-21–3p and its target androgen receptor in STZ-induced diabetic cardiac fibrosis.
Methods
The pathological changes and collagen depositions was analyzed by HE, Sirius Red staining and Masson's Trichrome Staining. MiR-21–3p, AR, NLRP3, caspase1 and collagen I expression were analyzed by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, miR one step qRT-PCR, respectively. A luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the interaction between miR-21 and the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of AR.
Results
Our results indicated that miR-21–3p level was up-regulated, while AR was decreased in STZ-induced diabetic cardiac fibrosis tissues and cardiac fibroblast. High glucose triggers cardiac fibroblasts pyroptosis and collagen deposition. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that miR-21–3p mediated the crucial role in diabetic cardiac fibrosis. Our results show that miR-21–3p bound to the 3′UTR of AR post-transcriptionally repressed its expression. We also found AR, which regulates cardiac fibroblasts pyroptosis and collagen deposition through caspase1 signaling.
Conclusions
/interpretation: Taken together, our study showed that miR-21–3p aggravates STZ-induced diabetic cardiac fibrosis through the caspase1 pathways by suppressing AR expression.

Abstract: It has been suggested that the bone marrow microenvironment harbors two distinct populations of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), one with a perivascular location and other present in the endosteum. A better understanding of the biology of these MSC subsets has been pursued in order to refine its clinical application. However, most comparative characterizations of mouse MSC have been performed in normoxia. This can result in misleading interpretations since mouse MSC subsets with low/defective p53 activity are known to be selected during culture in normoxia. Here, we report a comprehensive in vitro characterization of mouse MSC isolated from bone marrow (BM-MSC) and compact bone (CB-MSC) expanded and assayed under hypoxia for their morphology, clonogenic efficiency and differentiation capacity. We found that, under hypoxia, compact bone is richer in absolute numbers of MSC and isolation of MSC from compact bone is associated with a reduced risk of hematopoietic cell carryover. In addition, CB-MSC have higher in vitro osteogenic capacity than BM-MSC, while adipogenic differentiation potential is similar. These findings reinforce the hypothesis of the existence of MSC in bone marrow and compact bone representing functionally distinct cell populations and highlight the compact bone as an efficient source of murine MSC under physiological oxygen concentrations.

Abstract: Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a co-transcription activator, shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Phosphorylation by large tumor suppressor kinases (LATS1/2) is the major determinant of YAP1 subcellular localization. Unphosphorylated YAP1 interacts with transcription factors in the nucleus and regulates gene transcription, while phosphorylated YAP1 is trapped in the cytoplasm and is degraded. We found that when U2OS and HeLa cells are exposed to 42 °C, YAP1 enters the nucleus within 30 min and returns to the cytoplasm at 4 h. SRC and HSP90 are involved in nuclear accumulation and return to the cytoplasm, respectively. Upon heat shock, LATS2 forms aggregates including protein phosphatase 1 and is dephosphorylated and inactivated. SRC activation is necessary for the formation of aggregates, while HSP90 is required for their dissociation. YAP1 is involved in heat shock-induced NF-κB signaling. Mechanistically, YAP1 is implicated in strengthening the interaction between RELA and DPF3, a component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in response to heat shock. Thus, YAP1 plays a role as a thermosensor.

Abstract: Nano-sized Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane vesicles possess unique structural and immunostimulatory effects that could be exploited to regress tumors by alerting the host immune system and reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The current study was conducted to investigate the antitumor activity of the outer membrane vesicles (ST-OMVs) of Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028, in vitro in human colorectal carcinoma (HTC116), breast cancer (MCF-7), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines and in vivo in Ehrlich solid carcinoma-bearing mice model either as a mono-immunotherapy or as an adjuvant to a commonly used conventional chemotherapy. In addition, we investigated the safety of ST-OMVs. Adult Swiss albino female mice with transplanted Ehrlich solid carcinoma were treated with either ST-OMVs, paclitaxel or a combination of both. Tumor volume, growth inhibition rate, quantitative RT-PCR of Bax and VEGF genes expression, histopathology and immune-expression of caspase-3, Beclin-1, CD49b and Ki-67 were all analyzed. Our results showed that ST-OMVs significantly decreased tumor volume, significantly increased tumor growth inhibition rate, up-regulated the immunohistochemical expression of caspase-3, Beclin-1, and CD49b (enhanced recruitment of NK cells). Furthermore, ST-OMVs down-regulated the expression of Ki-67, increased Bax gene expression and decreased VEGF gene expression as detected by qRT-PCR analysis. Histologically, ST-OMVs promoted apoptosis, decreased tumor invasion and mitotic activities. Moreover, ST-OMVs showed a remarkable cytotoxic activity in various investigated in vitro cancer cell lines. Our findings demonstrate potential antitumor activity of ST-OMVs that might be used as a promising safe antitumor immunotherapy or an adjuvant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, resolving some of their problems.

Abstract: Summary
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) latently infects approximately one-fourth of the world’s population. The immune mechanisms that govern progression from latent (LTBI) to active pulmonary TB (PTB) remain poorly defined. Experimentally Mtb-infected non-human primates (NHP) mirror the disease observed in humans and recapitulate both PTB and LTBI. We characterized the lung immune landscape in NHPs with LTBI and PTB using high-throughput technologies. Three defining features of PTB in macaque lungs include the influx of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), an Interferon (IFN)-responsive macrophage population, and activated T cell responses. In contrast, a CD27+ Natural killer (NK) cell subset accumulated in the lungs of LTBI macaques. This NK cell population was also detected in the circulation of LTBI individuals. This comprehensive analysis of the lung immune landscape will improve the understanding of TB immunopathogenesis, providing potential targets for therapies and vaccines for TB control.

Abstract: Summary
COVID-19 patients often develop severe cardiovascular complications, but it remains unclear if these are caused directly by viral infection or are secondary to a systemic response. Here, we examine the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) and smooth muscle cells (hPSC-SMCs). We find that that SARS-CoV-2 selectively infects hPSC-CMs through the viral receptor ACE2, whereas in hPSC-SMCs there is minimal viral entry or replication. After entry into cardiomyocytes, SARS-CoV-2 is assembled in lysosome-like vesicles and egresses via bulk exocytosis. The viral transcripts become a large fraction of cellular mRNA while host gene expression shifts from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism and upregulates chromatin modification and RNA splicing pathways. Most importantly, viral infection of hPSC-CMs progressively impairs both their electrophysiological and contractile function, and causes widespread cell death. These data support the hypothesis that COVID-19-related cardiac symptoms can result from a direct cardiotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Neurotoxicity induced by glutamate (Glu) is often used to study the signaling mechanism of neurological disorders. The identification of specific genetic factors that cause Glu-induced neurotoxicity provides evidence for the common pathways of neuronal apoptosis and inflammation. TRIM27 has been found to induce apoptosis and inflammation. Nevertheless, there is little evidence that TRIM27 is associated with Glu-induced neurotoxicity. We found that TRIM27 expression was increased in epilepsy patients and in HT22 cells following Glu treatment. Glu-mediated cell apoptosis, decreased PPARγ expression, and increased levels of cleaved Caspase-3 and IL-1β expression in HT22 cells were significantly inhibited by TRIM27 knockdown. TRIM27 overexpression significantly induced cell apoptosis and expression of cleaved Caspase-3 and IL-1β, but inhibited PPARγ expression in HT22 cells, which were reversed by ROZ, suggesting the involvement of PPARγ in TRIM27-mediated cell apoptosis and inflammation in HT22 cells. Mechanically, TRIM27 ubiquitinates and degrades PPARγ, following induces cleaved Caspase-3 and IL-1β expression. Clinically, increased expression of TRIM27 in epilepsy patients was associated with decreased PPARγ expression. Taken together, our study suggests that TRIM27-mediated ubiquitination of PPARγ promotes Glu-induced HT22 cell apoptosis and IL-1β release.

Abstract: Summary
Functional analysis of lysine 27-linked ubiquitin chains (K27Ub) is difficult due to the inability to make them through enzymatic methods and due to a lack of model tools and substrates. Here we generate a series of ubiquitin (Ub) tools to study how the deubiquitinase UCHL3 responds to K27Ub chains in comparison to lysine 63-linked chains and mono-Ub. From a crystal structure of a complex between UCHL3 and synthetic K27Ub2, we unexpectedly discover that free K27Ub2 and K27Ub2-conjugated substrates are natural inhibitors of UCHL3. Using our Ub tools to profile UCHL3's activity, we generate a quantitative kinetic model of the inhibitory mechanism and we find that K27Ub2 can inhibit UCHL3 covalently, by binding to its catalytic cysteine, and allosterically, by locking its catalytic loop tightly in place. Based on this inhibition mechanism, we propose that UCHL3 and K27Ub chains likely sense and regulate each other in cells.

Abstract: Summary
Studying the microbial composition of internal organs and their associations with disease remains challenging due to the difficulty of acquiring clinical biopsies. We designed a statistical model to analyze the prevalence of species across sample types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), revealing that species equiprevalent across sample types are predominantly contaminants, bearing unique signatures from each TCGA-designated sequencing center. Removing such species mitigated batch effects and isolated the tissue-resident microbiome, which was validated by original matched TCGA samples. Gene copies and nucleotide variants can further distinguish mixed-evidence species. We, thus, present The Cancer Microbiome Atlas (TCMA), a collection of curated, decontaminated microbial compositions of oropharyngeal, esophageal, gastrointestinal, and colorectal tissues. This led to the discovery of prognostic species and blood signatures of mucosal barrier injuries and enabled systematic matched microbe-host multi-omic analyses, which will help guide future studies of the microbiome’s role in human health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) reversibly nicks chromosomal DNA to relax strain accumulated during transcription, replication, chromatin assembly, and chromosome condensation. The Top1 poison camptothecin targets cancer cells by trapping the enzyme in the covalent complex Top1cc, tethered to cleaved DNA by a tyrosine-3′-phosphate bond. In vitro mechanistic studies point to interfacial inhibition, where camptothecin binding to the Top1-DNA interface stabilizes Top1cc. Here we present a complementary covalent mechanism that is critical in vivo. We observed that camptothecins induce oxidative stress, leading to lipid peroxidation, lipid-derived electrophile accumulation, and Top1 poisoning via covalent modification. The electrophile 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal can induce Top1cc on its own and forms a Michael adduct to a cysteine thiol in the Top1 active site, potentially blocking tyrosine dephosphorylation and 3′ DNA phosphate release. Thereby, camptothecins may leverage a physiological cysteine-based redox switch in Top1 to mediate their selective toxicity to rapidly proliferating cancer cells.

Abstract: Intrinsic protein disorder is an interesting structural feature where fully functional proteins lack a three-dimensional structure in solution. In this work, we estimated the relative content of intrinsic protein disorder in 96 plant proteomes including monocots and eudicots. In this analysis, we found variation in the relative abundance of intrinsic protein disorder among these major clades; the relative level of disorder is higher in monocots than eudicots. In turn, there is an inverse relationship between the degree of intrinsic protein disorder and protein length, with smaller proteins being more disordered. The relative abundance of amino acids depends on intrinsic disorder and also varies among clades. Within the nucleus, intrinsically disordered proteins are more abundant than ordered proteins. Intrinsically disordered proteins are specialized in regulatory functions, nucleic acid binding, RNA processing, and in response to environmental stimuli. The implications of this on plants’ responses to their environment are discussed.

Abstract: Although surgical treatment cures >90% of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients, the remaining patients, including advanced DTC cases, have poor clinical outcomes. These patients with inoperable disease have only two choices of radioactive iodine therapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as lenvatinib, which have a high incidence of treatment-related adverse events and can only prolong progression free survival by approximately 5–15 months. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effects of combination therapy with lenvatinib and radiation (CTLR) for DTC. CTLR synergistically inhibited cell replication and colony formation in vitro and tumor growth in nude mice without apparent toxicities and suppressed the expression of proliferation marker (Ki-67). CTLR also induced apoptosis and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Moreover, quantitative analysis of the intracellular uptake of lenvatinib using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry demonstrated that intracellular uptake of lenvatinib was significantly increased 48 h following irradiation. These data suggest that increased membrane permeability caused by irradiation increases the intracellular concentration of levatinib, contributing to the synergistic effect. This mechanism-based potential of combination therapy suggests a powerful new therapeutic strategy for advanced thyroid cancer with fewer side effects and might be a milestone for developing a regimen in clinical practice.

Abstract: Posterior capsule opacification (PCO), resulting from residual lens epithelial cell (LEC) epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), abnormal proliferation, and migration, is the most common complication of cataract surgery. A recent study determined that extracellular vesicles (EVs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate the EMT process during cutaneous wound healing and tumour metastasis. However, their underlying mechanism in PCO is unclear. In this study, we examined the secreted EVs from a scratch model in vitro. We found that the production of ROS was increased after mechanical injury, especially at the wound edge, and there was an increased viability of LECs, which can be blocked by diphenyleneiodonium, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. Cell viability and migration were increased upon treatment with 1 μM H2O2, but significantly reduced when the concentration of H2O2 increased to 100 μM. Transwell assay showed that both post-surgery LECs and LECs treated with 1 μM H2O2 significantly induced the migration of normal LECs by EV secretion. Extraction and quantification of EVs derived from injured and H2O2-treated LECs showed a similar increase in production. Co-incubation of EVs from both injured and H2O2-treated LECs with normal LECs and organ-cultured mouse lenses activated EMT, which was attenuated by a ROS inhibitor. These results suggest that EVs participate in ROS-induced lens EMT, making EVs a potential target for treating PCO.

Abstract: The cancer/testis antigen lactate dehydrogenase-C4 (LDHC) is a specific isoenzyme of the LDH family that regulates invasion and metastasis in some malignancies; however, little is known regarding its role in progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Thus, we investigated LDHC expression by immunohistochemistry, and analyzed its clinical significance in 88 LUAD specimens. The role and molecular mechanisms subserving LDHC in cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion were explored both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, we found that high LDHC expression was significantly correlated with clinicopathological features of aggressive LUAD and a poor prognosis. Overexpression of LDHC induced LUAD cells to produce lactate and ATP, increased their metastatic and invasive potential—, and accelerated xenograft tumor growth. We further demonstrated that overexpression of LDHC affected the expression of cell proliferation-related proteins (cyclin D1 and c-Myc) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins (MMP-2, MMP-9, E-cadherin, Vimentin, Twist, Slug, and Snail) both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, excessive activation of LDHC enhanced the phosphorylation levels of AKT and GSK-3β, revealing activation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β oncogenic-signaling pathways. Treatment with a PI3K inhibitor reversed the effects of LDHC overexpression by inhibiting cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion, with diminished levels of p-Akt and p-GSK3β. PI3K inhibition also reversed cell proliferation-related and EMT-related proteins in LDHC-overexpressing A549 cells. In conclusion, LDHC promotes proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in LUAD cells via activation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway.

Abstract: Neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) comprising of decondensed chromatin that immobilizes and kills pathogens. In vitro generation of neutrophils on a large scale from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) may be a useful strategy for treating neutropenic patients in future, though it is not in clinical practice yet. Microbial infections lead to major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Despite the importance of NET in preventing infection, efficacy of in vitro-generated neutrophils from HSCs to form NET is not tested. We show that functional neutrophils could be generated in vitro from HSCs/MNCs isolated from umbilical cord blood (UCB) and apheresis-derived peripheral blood (APBL). Neutrophils generated from UCB showed properties comparable to those isolated from peripheral blood. We also show that isolation of HSCs is not absolutely essential for in vitro neutrophil generation. Further, we show that neutrophils generated from HSCs express PADI4 enzyme and their NET-forming ability is comparable to peripheral blood neutrophils. Taken together, our data show that fully functional neutrophils can be generated in vitro from HSCs. NET-forming ability of in vitro-generated neutrophils is an important parameter to determine their functionality and thus, should be studied along with other standard functional assays.

Abstract: Summary
The host response to SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrates significant interindividual variability. In addition to showing more disease in males, the elderly, and individuals with underlying comorbidities, SARS-CoV-2 can seemingly afflict healthy individuals with profound clinical complications. We hypothesize that, in addition to viral load and host antibody repertoire, host genetic variants influence vulnerability to infection. Here we apply human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models and CRISPR engineering to explore the host genetics of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs4702), common in the population and located in the 3′ UTR of the protease FURIN, influences alveolar and neuron infection by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Thus, we provide a proof-of-principle finding that common genetic variation can have an impact on viral infection and thus contribute to clinical heterogeneity in COVID-19. Ongoing genetic studies will help to identify high-risk individuals, predict clinical complications, and facilitate the discovery of drugs.

Abstract: Tropisetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that exerts protective effect against DN. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible molecular mechanisms associated with the renoprotective effects of tropisetron in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Animals were subdivided into 5 equal groups; control, tropisetron, diabetes, tropisetron + diabetes, and glibenclamide + diabetes (n = 7). For induction of type 1 diabetes, a single injection of STZ (55 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to the animals. Diabetic rats were treated with tropisetron (3 mg/kg) and glibenclamide (1 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. According to the conducted analysis, diabetes led to renal dysfunction (reduction in glomerular filtration rate and urine urea and creatinine as well as elevation in plasma urea and creatinine) and abnormalities in antioxidant defense system (reduction in TAC and elevation in MDA), compared with the control group, which was prevented by tropisetron treatment. Reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analysis demonstrated that SIRT1 gene expression decreased while FOXO3a and NF-κB gene expression as well as phosphorylated FOXO3a/total FOXO3a protein ratios and claudin-1 protein level increased in the kidney of diabetic rats compared with the control group. Herein, the results of this research showed that tropisetron treatment reversed these changes. Besides, all these changes were comparable with those produced by glibenclamide as a positive control. Hence, tropisetron ameliorated renal damage due to diabetic nephropathy possibly by suppressing oxidative stress and alteration of SIRT1, FOXO3a, and claudin-1 levels.

Abstract: Summary
As mammals evolved with exposure to particular diets, naturally abundant compounds may have become part of the set of environmental co-determinants that shaped brain structure and function. Here we investigated whether bioactive factors found in apples directly affect hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult mouse. We found that quercetin, the most abundant flavanol in apple peel, was anti-proliferative at high concentrations but pro-neurogenic at low concentrations. This was confirmed in vivo, with intraperitoneally delivered quercetin promoting survival and neuronal differentiation, without affecting proliferation. Using a bioassay-guided fractionation approach we also identified additional pro-neurogenic compounds in apple flesh that were not related to flavonoids. We found that 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid significantly increased neural precursor cell proliferation and neurogenesis. This work shows that both flavonoids and 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid are pro-neurogenic, not only by activating precursor cell proliferation but also by promoting cell-cycle exit, cellular survival, and neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Plant roots are built of concentric cell layers that are thought to respond to microbial infections by employing specific, genetically defined programs. Yet, the functional impact of this radial organization remains elusive, particularly due to the lack of genome-wide techniques for monitoring expression at a cell-layer resolution. Here, cell-type-specific expression of tagged ribosomes enabled the isolation of ribosome-bound mRNA to obtain cell-layer translatomes (TRAP-seq, translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA sequencing). After inoculation with the vascular pathogen Verticillium longisporum, pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora parasitica, or mutualistic endophyte Serendipita indica, root cell-layer responses reflected the fundamentally different colonization strategies of these microbes. Notably, V. longisporum specifically suppressed the endodermal barrier, which restricts fungal progression, allowing microbial access to the root central cylinder. Moreover, localized biosynthesis of antimicrobial compounds and ethylene differed in response to pathogens and mutualists. These examples highlight the power of this resource to gain insights into root-microbe interactions and to develop strategies in crop improvement.

Abstract: The Yangtze River Delta white goat is a sole goat species that can naturally produce superior-quality brush hair. It's worth to mention that study the developmental mechanism of goat hair follicle stem cells is vital for future breed preservation and molecular breeding. In this study, we successfully isolated hair follicle stem cells from the skin tissue of fetal sheep neck spine, and harvested superior-quality and normal-quality brush hair goat tissue. The expression of miR-31-5p in goat hair follicle stem cells was verified by qPCR and Western blot. The effects of overexpression or inhibition of miR-31-5p on the proliferation and apoptosis of hair follicle stem cells were detected by EdU, CCK-8, flow cytometry, etc. miR-31-5p can significantly improve cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis by targeting RASA1 and upregulating MAP3K1 level, whereas miR-31-5p knockdown led to an opposite effect. These results reveal a miR-31-5p-associated regulatory network between miR-31-5p and RASA1/MAP3K1 during the progression of superiorquality brush hair traits.

Abstract: Summary
Mammary gland ductal morphogenesis depends on the differentiation of mammary stem cells (MaSCs) into basal and luminal lineages. The AP-2γ transcription factor, encoded by Tfap2c, has a central role in mammary gland development but its effect in mammary lineages and specifically MaSCs is largely unknown. Here, we utilized an inducible, conditional knockout of Tfap2c to elucidate the role of AP-2γ in maintenance and differentiation of MaSCs. Loss of AP-2γ in the basal epithelium profoundly altered the transcriptomes and decreased the number of cells within several clusters of mammary epithelial cells, including adult MaSCs and luminal progenitors. AP-2γ regulated the expression of genes known to be required for mammary development, including Cebpb, Nfkbia, and Rspo1. As a result, AP-2γ-deficient mice exhibited repressed mammary gland ductal outgrowth and inhibition of regenerative capacity. The findings demonstrate that AP-2γ can regulate development of mammary gland structures potentially regulating maintenance and differentiation of multipotent MaSCs.

Abstract: Chronic stress has been related to multiple diseases. Inflammation is proposed strongly to link stress to stress-related diseases in different organs, such as small intestine, colon, and brain. However, stress cellular effect on the pancreatic tissue, especially the exocrine one, had received relatively little attention. This work aimed to evaluate the cellular effect of chronic immobilization stress on the pancreatic tissue function and structure along with evaluating the sex role in this type of pancreatic injury. Thirty rats were equally divided into 5 groups: control male, control female, stressed male, stressed female, and stressed female with bilateral ovariectomy. Stressed rats were exposed to immobilization for 1 h/day, 6 days/week, for 3 weeks. Rats were then decapitated for further biochemical, histological, histo-morphometric, and immunohistochemical study. The results showed that, in male and female rats, chronic immobilization stress produced hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, with increasing exocrine pancreatic injury markers by increasing oxidative and inflammatory status of the pancreatic tissue, and exhibited a degenerative effect on the pancreatic tissue. However, the stress-induced pancreatic effects were more obvious in male rats and female rats with bilateral ovariectomy than that in female rats. It could be concluded that male animals were more susceptible to stress-induced pancreatic damage than females. The ovarian hormones are responsible, at least partly, for pancreatic tissue protection since the stress-induced pancreatic injury in females was exacerbated by ovariectomy. In this study, inflammatory and oxidative stress differences in both sexes could provide a plausible explanation for sex differences.

Abstract: This study aimed to verify the anti-inflammatory effect of soybean isoflavones (SI) on the inflammatory response induced by Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) of bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs) and to elucidate its possible mechanism. BMECs were pretreated with SI of different concentrations (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 μg/mL) for 0.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24 h. And then, S. agalactiae was used to infect bMECs for 6 h (MOI = 50:1) to establish the inflammation model. Cell viability, growth curves of S. agalactiae, cytotoxicity, and S. agalactiae invasion rate were determined. A proteomics technique was used to further detect differential proteins and enrichment pathways. SI (40 μg/mL) improved the viability of bMECs at 12 h (p < 0.05) and 60 and 80 μg/mL of SI greater (p < 0.01). Moreover, 60 μg/mL of SI protects cells from bacterial damage (p < 0.05). SI could inhibit S. agalactiae growth and internalization into bMECs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, proteomics results showed that 133 proteins were up-regulated and 89 proteins were down-regulated significantly. The differentially significantly expressed proteins (DSEPs) were mainly related to cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration. GO annotation showed that 222 DSEPs were divided into 23 biological processes (BP) terms, 14 cell components (CC) terms, and 12 molecular functions (MF) terms. DSEPs were significantly enriched in 10 pathways, of which the immune pathway was the main enrichment pathway.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 causes a spectrum of COVID-19 disease, the immunological basis of which remains ill defined. We analyzed 85 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals at acute and/or convalescent time points, up to 102 days after symptom onset, quantifying 184 immunological parameters. Acute COVID-19 presented with high levels of IL-6, IL-18, and IL-10 and broad activation marked by the upregulation of CD38 on innate and adaptive lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Importantly, activated CXCR3+cTFH1 cells in acute COVID-19 significantly correlate with and predict antibody levels and their avidity at convalescence as well as acute neutralization activity. Strikingly, intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe COVID-19 display higher levels of soluble IL-6, IL-6R, and IL-18, and hyperactivation of innate, adaptive, and myeloid compartments than patients with moderate disease. Our analyses provide a comprehensive map of longitudinal immunological responses in COVID-19 patients and integrate key cellular pathways of complex immune networks underpinning severe COVID-19, providing important insights into potential biomarkers and immunotherapies.

Abstract: As of today, only acute effects of RF fields have been confirmed to represent a potential health hazard and they are attributed to non-specific heating (≥ 1 °C) under high-level exposure. Yet, the possibility that environmental RF impact living matter in the absence of temperature elevation needs further investigation. Since HSF1 is both a thermosensor and the master regulator of heat-shock stress response in eukaryotes, it remains to assess HSF1 activation in live cells under exposure to low-level RF signals. We thus measured basal, temperature-induced, and chemically induced HSF1 trimerization, a mandatory step on the cascade of HSF1 activation, under RF exposure to continuous wave (CW), Global System for Mobile (GSM), and Wi-Fi-modulated 1800 MHz signals, using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer technique (BRET) probe. Our results show that, as expected, HSF1 is heat-activated by acute exposure of transiently transfected HEK293T cells to a CW RF field at a specific absorption rate of 24 W/kg for 30 min. However, we found no evidence of HSF1 activation under the same RF exposure condition when the cell culture medium temperature was fixed. We also found no experimental evidence that, at a fixed temperature, chronic RF exposure for 24 h at a SAR of 1.5 and 6 W/kg altered the potency or the maximal capability of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to activate HSF1, whatever signal used. We only found that RF exposure to CW signals (1.5 and 6 W/kg) and GSM signals (1.5 W/kg) for 24 h marginally decreased basal HSF1 activity.

Abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common malignant tumor in the world. Radiotherapy is one of the standard therapies for patients with OSCC, but its clinical efficiency is limited due to radioresistance. In this study, we identified a mechanism of such resistance regulated by Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14). USP14 expression was significantly increased in clinical OSCC tissue samples and cell lines, and OSCC patients with high USP14 expression predicted poor overall survival rate. Additionally, a negative correlation between USP14 and LC3B was observed in patients with OSCC. We then found that irradiation (IR)-reduced cell survival of OSCC cells lines was further decreased when USP14 was knocked down. However, USP14 over-expression significantly promoted the cell viability of OSCC cells after IR treatment. Colony formation analysis confirmed thatafter IR treatment,USP14 knockdown markedly decreased the proliferation of OSCC cells, but over-expressing USP14 significantly up-regulated the proliferative activity of OSCC cells. Furthermore, DNA damage caused by IR was enhanced by USP14 knockdown, while been suppressed in OSCC cells with USP14 over-expression. Additionally, IR-inducedapoptosis was further promoted by USP14 knockdown in OSCC cells, which was, however, significantly abolished by USP14 over-expression.Moreover, our in vivo studies showed that IR-reduced tumor growth and tumor weight were further enhanced by USP14 knockdown in OSCC tumor-bearing nude mice. Finally, we found that USP14 knockdown could promote IR-induced autophagy by increasing LC3BII and γH2AX expression levels in IR-treated OSCC cells. However, this event was markedly abolished by ATG5 knockdown, subsequently restoring the cell proliferation in IR-incubated OSCC cells.Finally, we found that USP14-mediated apoptosis was autophagy-dependent in IR-treated OSCC cells. Taken together, these findings suggested that suppressing USP14 could alleviateradioresistancein OSCC both in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis and autophagy, and thus could be served as a promising therapeutic strategy for OSCC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests with a range of severities, but immune signatures of mild and severe disease are still not fully understood. Here, we use mass cytometry and targeted proteomics to profile the innate immune response of patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and of healthy individuals. Sampling at different stages allows us to reconstruct a pseudo-temporal trajectory of the innate response. A surge of CD169+ monocytes associated with an IFN-γ+MCP-2+ signature rapidly follows symptom onset. At later stages, we observe a persistent inflammatory phenotype in patients with severe disease, dominated by high CCL3 and CCL4 abundance correlating with the re-appearance of CD16+ monocytes, whereas the response of mild COVID-19 patients normalizes. Our data provide insights into the dynamic nature of inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients and identify sustained innate immune responses as a likely mechanism in severe patients, thus supporting the investigation of targeted interventions in severe COVID-19.

Abstract: The ubiquitin-like protein FAT10 and the hexokinase protein HK2 play vital regulatory roles in several cellular processes. However, the relationship between these two proteins and their role in the pathogenesis of bladder cancer are not well understood. Here, we found that FAT10 and HK2 protein levels were markedly higher in bladder cancer tissues than in normal adjacent tissues. In addition, RNAi-mediated silencing of FAT10 led to reduced HK2 levels and suppressed bladder cancer progression in vivo and in vitro. The results of our in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that HK2 is critical for FAT10-mediated progression of bladder cancer. The current study demonstrated that FAT10 enhanced the progression of bladder cancer by positively regulating HK2 via the EGFR/AKT pathway. Based on our findings, FAT10 is believed to stabilize EGFR expression by modulating its degradation and ubiquitination. The results of the current study indicate that there is a correlation between FAT10 and HK2 in the progression of bladder cancer. In addition, we identified a new pathway that may be involved in the regulation of HK2. These findings implicate dysfunction of the FAT10, EGFR/AKT, and HK2 regulatory circuit in the progression of bladder cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) replacement holds potential for restoring vision lost to optic neuropathy. Transplanted RGCs must undergo neuroretinal integration to receive afferent visual signals for processing and efferent transmission. To date, retinal integration following RGC transplantation has been limited. We sought to overcome key barriers to transplanted human stem cell-derived RGC integration. Following co-culture ex vivo on organotypic mouse retinal explants, human RGCs cluster and extend bundled neurites that remain superficial to the neuroretina, hindering afferent synaptogenesis. To enhance integration, we increased the cellular permeability of the internal limiting membrane (ILM). Extracellular matrix digestion using proteolytic enzymes achieved ILM disruption while minimizing retinal toxicity and preserving glial reactivity. ILM disruption is associated with dispersion rather than clustering of co-cultured RGC bodies and neurites, and increased parenchymal neurite ingrowth. The ILM represents a significant obstacle to transplanted RGC connectivity and its circumvention may be necessary for functional RGC replacement.

Abstract: Summary
The benzdiimidazole NAB2 rescues α-synuclein-associated trafficking defects associated with early onset Parkinson's disease in a Nedd4-dependent manner. Despite identification of E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 as a putative target of NAB2, its molecular mechanism of action has not been elucidated. As such, the effect of NAB2 on Nedd4 activity and specificity was interrogated through biochemical, biophysical, and proteomic analyses. NAB2 was found to bind Nedd4 (KDapp = 42 nM), but this binding is side chain mediated and does not alter its conformation or ubiquitination kinetics in vitro. Nedd4 co-localizes with trafficking organelles, and NAB2 exposure did not alter its co-localization. Ubiquitin enrichment coupled proteomics revealed that NAB2 stimulates ubiquitination of trafficking-associated proteins, most likely through modulating the substrate specificity of Nedd4, providing a putative protein network involved in the NAB2 mechanism and revealing trafficking scaffold protein TFG as a Nedd4 substrate.

Abstract: The homeostasis of the stem cell niche is regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and the complex and ordered molecular and cellular regulatory mechanisms need to be further explored. In Drosophila testis, germline stem cells (GSCs) rely on hub cells for self-renewal and physical attachment. GSCs are also in contact with somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). Utilizing genetic manipulation in Drosophila, we investigated the role of Wnt6 in vivo and in vitro. In Drosophila testis, we found that Wnt6 is required for GSC differentiation and CySC self-renewal. In Schneider 2 (S2) cells, we found that Wnt6 regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Wnt6 can downregulate the expression levels of Arm, Rac1 and Cdc42 in S2 cells. Notably, Rac1 and Cdc42, which act downstream of the noncanonical Wnt signalling pathway, imitated the phenotypes of Wnt6 in Drosophila testis. Thus, the newly discovered Wnt6-Rac1/Cdc42 signal axis is required for the homeostasis of the stem cell niche in the Drosophila testis.

EGLP-1 lowers body weight better than exendin-4 by reducing food intake and increasing basal energy expenditure in diet-induced obese mice,

Abstract: It is well known that GLP-1 activates GLP-1R to reduce body weight by inhibiting eating. GLP-1 is cleaved by the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) 24.11 into a pentapeptide GLP-1 (32–36) amide, which increases basal energy expenditure and inhibits weight gain in obese mice. It is well known that GLP-1 analogs can reduce weight by suppressing eating. However, there are few reports of reducing weight through the dual effects of inhibiting eating and increasing basic energy. Here, we report the peptide EGLP-1, a GLP-1 analogue, which can reduce food intake and increase basal energy expenditure. In C2C12 myotubes, EGLP-1 can increase both phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and the ratio between phosphorylation of ACC and the total expression of ACC (pACC/ACC). In diet-induced obese mice, EGLP-1 is more effective than exendin-4 in reducing body weight, reducing fat mass and improving hepatic steatosis. At the same time, EGLP-1 can improve hyperglycemia, reduce food intake, and improve insulin resistance, just like exendin-4. In addition, EGLP-1, not exendin-4, can improve physiological parameters associated with lipid metabolism and increase oxygen consumption by increasing uncoupling proteins 3 (UCP3) expression and pACC/ACC ratio in skeletal muscle. Taken together, this data showed that EGLP-1 is able to reduce body weight by reducing food intake and increasing basal energy expenditure, suggesting it may be more effective in treating diabetic and non-diabetic overweight or obese people than pure GLP-1R agonist exendin-4.

Abstract: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the primary cause of visual impairment and vision loss in premature infants, which results from the formation of aberrant retinal neovascularization (NV). An emerging body of evidence has shown that Müller cells are the predominant source of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which also serves as a chemoattractant for monocyte/macrophage lineage. The recruitment of macrophages is increased during retinal NV, and they exert a pro-angiogenic role in ROP. We have shown that lymphocytic microparticles (microvesicles; LMPs) derived from apoptotic human T lymphocytes possess strong angiogenesis-inhibiting properties. Here, we investigated the effect of LMPs on the chemotactic capacity of Müller cells in vitro using rat Müller cell rMC-1 and mouse macrophage RAW 264.7. In addition, the impact of LMPs was determined in vivo using a mouse model of oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy (OIR). The results revealed that LMPs were internalized by rMC-1 and reduced their cell proliferation dose-dependently without inducing cell apoptosis. LMPs inhibited the chemotactic capacity of rMC-1 on RAW 264.7 via reducing the expression of VEGF. Moreover, LMPs attenuated pathological retinal NV and the infiltration of macrophages in vivo. LMPs downregulated ERK1/2 and HIF-1α both in vitro and in vivo. These findings expand our understanding of the effects of LMPs, providing evidence of LMPs as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of retinal NV diseases.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, among which acute myocardial infarction (AMI) frequently occurs in the heart and proceeds from myocardium ischemia and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cell death. Numerous studies on miRNAs indicated their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and treatment targets for heart diseases. Our study investigated the role of miR-17-5p and its regulatory mechanisms during AMI. Echocardiography, MTT, flow cytometry assay, evaluation of caspase-3 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity were conducted to assess cell viability, apoptosis in an MI/R mice model, and an H2O2-induced H9c2 hypoxia cell model, respectively. The expression levels of ER stress response-related biomarkers were detected using qRT-PCR, IHC, and western blotting assays. The binding site of miR-17-5p on Tsg101 mRNA was determined by bioinformatic prediction and luciferase reporter assay. The expression levels of miR-17-5p were notably elevated in MI/R mice and hypoxia cell models, accompanied by enhanced cell apoptosis. Inhibition of miR-17-5p led to decreased apoptosis related to ER stress response in the hypoxia model, which could be counteracted by knockdown of Tsg101 (tumor susceptibility gene 101). Transfection with miR-17-5p mimics downregulated the expression of Tsg101 in H9c2 cells. Luciferase assay demonstrated the binding between miR-17-5p and Tsg101. Moreover, 4-PBA, the inhibitor of the ER stress response, abolished shTsg101 elevated apoptosis in hypoxic H9c2 cells. Our findings investigated the pro-apoptotic role of miR-17-5p during MI/R, disclosed the specific mechanism of miR-17-5p/Tsg101 regulatory axis in ER stress-induced myocardium injury and cardiomyocytes apoptosis, and presented a promising diagnostic biomarker and potential target for therapy of AMI.

Abstract: Summary
The recent development of successful CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T cell therapies has been accompanied by a need to better control potentially fatal toxicities that can arise from adverse immune reactions. Here we present a ligand-controlled CAR system, based on the IKZF3 ZF2 β-hairpin IMiD-inducible degron, which allows for the reversible control of expression levels of type I membrane proteins, including CARs. Testing this system in an established mouse xenotransplantation model for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we validate the ability of the CAR19-degron to target and kill CD19-positive cells displaying complete control/clearance of the tumor. We also demonstrate that the activity of CAR19-degron can be regulated in vivo when dosing a US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, lenalidomide.

Abstract: Summary
Schistosome eggs provoke the formation of granulomas, organized immune aggregates, around them. For the host, the granulomatous response can be both protective and pathological. Granulomas are also postulated to facilitate egg extrusion through the gut lumen, a necessary step for parasite transmission. We used zebrafish larvae to visualize the granulomatous response to Schistosomamansoni eggs and inert egg-sized beads. Mature eggs rapidly recruit macrophages, which form granulomas within days. Beads also induce granulomas rapidly, through a foreign body response. Strikingly, immature eggs do not recruit macrophages, revealing that the eggshell is immunologically inert. Our findings suggest that the eggshell inhibits foreign body granuloma formation long enough for the miracidium to mature. Then parasite antigens secreted through the eggshell trigger granulomas that facilitate egg extrusion into the environment. In support of this model, we find that only mature S. mansoni eggs are shed into the feces of mice and humans.

Abstract: Delayed endothelial healing after drug eluting stent (DES) implantation is a critical clinical problem in treatment of coronary artery diseases. Exosomes exhibit proangiogenic potential in a variety of ischemic diseases. However, the association of exosomes with endothelial regeneration after DES implantation has been rarely reported. In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes on endothelial cells treated with rapamycin and explore the potential mechanisms of MSC-derived exosomes in promoting endothelial regeneration. Exosomes were isolated from MSCs by ultracentrifugation and identified by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western blot assay. The in vitro effects of MSC-derived exosomes on the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells treated with rapamycin were evaluated by integrated experiment, cell counting kit-8, scratch, tube formation, and transwell assays. And the apoptosis of rapamycin-induced endothelial cells loaded with MSC-derived exosomes was detected using TUNEL and Annexin-V FITC and PI double-staining assays. The microRNA (miRNA) cargo of MSC-derived exosomes was identified by high-throughput RNA sequencing. Pro-angiogenic miRNAs and key pathways were further characterized. Our results indicated that MSC-derived exosomes could be ingested into umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and significantly enhanced cell proliferation rate, migratory and tube-forming capabilities in vitro. MSC-derived exosomes also inhibited the apoptosis of HUVECs induced by rapamycin. A distinct class of exosomal miRNAs was further identified, including six miRNAs tightly related to neovasculogenesis. Silencing the expression of exosomal miRNA-21–5p and let-7c-5p attenuated the pro-proliferative and pro-migratory capacity of MSC-derived exosomes. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis indicated that metabolic pathways might contribute to reendothelialization. This study highlights a proregenerative effect of MSC-derived exosomes in vitro, which may be partly explained by the delivery of pro-angiogenic miRNAs to endothelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Determining which immunological mechanisms contribute to the development of broad neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) during HIV-1 infection is a major goal to inform vaccine design. Using samples from a longitudinal HIV-1 acute infection cohort, we found key B cell determinants within the first 14–43 days of viremia that predict the development of bNAbs years later. Individuals who develop neutralization breadth had significantly higher B cell engagement with the autologous founder HIV envelope (Env) within 1 month of initial viremia. A higher frequency of founder-Env-specific naive B cells was associated with increased B cell activation and differentiation and predictive of bNAb development. These data demonstrate that the initial B cell interaction with the founder HIV Env is important for the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies and provide evidence that events within HIV acute infection lead to downstream functional outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by a burst in the upper respiratory portal for high transmissibility. To determine human neutralizing antibodies (HuNAbs) for entry protection, we tested three potent HuNAbs (IC50 range, 0.0007–0.35 μg/mL) against live SARS-CoV-2 infection in the golden Syrian hamster model. These HuNAbs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by competing with human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 for binding to the viral receptor binding domain (RBD). Prophylactic intraperitoneal or intranasal injection of individual HuNAb or DNA vaccination significantly reduces infection in the lungs but not in the nasal turbinates of hamsters intranasally challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Although postchallenge HuNAb therapy suppresses viral loads and lung damage, robust infection is observed in nasal turbinates treated within 1–3 days. Our findings demonstrate that systemic HuNAb suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication and injury in lungs; however, robust viral infection in nasal turbinate may outcompete the antibody with significant implications to subprotection, reinfection, and vaccine.

Abstract: Summary
Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by cyclical mood shifts. Studies indicate that BD patients have a peripheral pro-inflammatory state and alterations in glial populations in the brain. We utilized an in vitro model to study inflammation-related phenotypes of astrocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from BD patients and healthy controls. BD astrocytes showed changes in transcriptome and induced a reduction in neuronal activity when co-cultured with neurons. IL-1β-stimulated BD astrocytes displayed a unique inflammatory gene expression signature and increased secretion of IL-6. Conditioned medium from stimulated BD astrocytes reduced neuronal activity, and this effect was partially blocked by IL-6 inactivating antibody. Our results suggest that BD astrocytes are functionally less supportive of neuronal excitability and this effect is partially mediated by IL-6. We confirmed higher IL-6 in blood in a distinct cohort of BD patients, highlighting the potential role of astrocyte-mediated inflammatory signaling in BD neuropathology.

Abstract: The splicing machinery heavily contributes to biological complexity and especially to the ability of cells to adapt to altered cellular conditions. Hypoxia also plays a key role in the pathophysiology of many disease states. Recent studies have revealed that tumorigenesis and hypoxia are involved in large-scale alterations in alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Fas pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced by excluding exon 6 to produce soluble Fas (sFas) protein that lacks a transmembrane domain and acts by inhibiting Fas mediated apoptosis. In the present study we show that U2AF is involved in hypoxia dependent anti-apoptotic Fas mRNA isoform formation. Our performed studies show that U2AF-RNA interaction is reduced in hypoxic cells, leading to reduction of Fas and increased sFas mRNAs formation. Efficient U2AF-RNA interactions of both subunits are important for Fas exon 6 inclusion into forming mRNA in normoxic and hypoxic cells.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive disorder of unknown etiology, is characterized by pathological lung fibroblast activation and proliferation resulting in abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix proteins within the lung parenchyma. The pathophysiological roles of exosomal microRNAs in pulmonary fibrosis remain unclear; therefore, we aimed to identify and characterize fibrosis-responsive exosomal microRNAs. We used microRNA array analysis and profiled the expression of exosome-derived miRNA in sera of C57BL/6 mice exhibiting bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The effect of microRNAs potentially involved in fibrosis was then evaluated in vivo and in vitro. The expression of exosomal microRNA-16 was increased by up to 8.0-fold on day 14 in bleomycin-treated mice, compared to vehicle-treated mice. MicroRNA-16 mimic administration on day 14 after bleomycin challenge ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis and suppressed lung and serum expression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC). Pretreatment of human lung fibroblasts with the microRNA-16 mimic decreased the expression of rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor) and TGF-β1–induced expression of SPARC. This is the first study reporting the anti-fibrotic properties of microRNA-16 and demonstrating that these effects occur via the mTORC2 pathway. These findings support that microRNA-16 may be a promising therapeutic target for IPF.

Abstract: Summary
Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for type 2 diabetes and is associated with changes in gut metabolites. Previous work uncovered a gut-restricted TGR5 agonist with anti-diabetic properties—cholic acid-7-sulfate (CA7S)—that is elevated following sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Here, we elucidate a microbiome-dependent pathway by which SG increases CA7S production. We show that a microbial metabolite, lithocholic acid (LCA), is increased in murine portal veins post-SG and by activating the vitamin D receptor, induces hepatic mSult2A1/hSULT2A expression to drive CA7S production. An SG-induced shift in the microbiome increases gut expression of the bile acid transporters Asbt and Ostα, which in turn facilitate selective transport of LCA across the gut epithelium. Cecal microbiota transplant from SG animals is sufficient to recreate the pathway in germ-free (GF) animals. Activation of this gut-liver pathway leads to CA7S synthesis and GLP-1 secretion, causally connecting a microbial metabolite with the improvement of diabetic phenotypes.

Abstract: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inheritable form of intellectual disability. FMR1, the gene responsible for FXS, is located on human chromosome Xq27.3 and contains a stretch of CGG trinucleotide repeats in its 5′ untranslated region. FXS is caused by CGG repeats that expand beyond 200, resulting in FMR1 silencing via promoter hypermethylation. The molecular mechanism underlying CGG repeat expansion, a fundamental cause of FXS, remains poorly understood, partly due to a lack of experimental systems. Accumulated evidence indicates that the large chromosomal region flanking a CGG repeat is critical for repeat dynamics. In the present study, we isolated and introduced whole human X chromosomes from healthy, FXS premutation carriers, or FXS patients who carried disease condition-associated CGG repeat lengths, into mouse A9 cells via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. The CGG repeat length-associated methylation status and human FMR1 expression in these monochromosomal hybrid cells mimicked those in humans. Thus, this set of A9 cells containing CGG repeats from three different origins (FXS-A9 panel) may provide a valuable resource for investigating a series of genetic and epigenetic CGG repeat dynamics during FXS pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 proteome shares regions of conservation with endemic human coronaviruses (CoVs), but it remains unknown to what extent these may be cross-recognized by the antibody response. Here, we study cross-reactivity using a highly multiplexed peptide assay (PepSeq) to generate an epitope-resolved view of IgG reactivity across all human CoVs in both COVID-19 convalescent and negative donors. PepSeq resolves epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins that are commonly targeted in convalescent donors, including several sites also recognized in some uninfected controls. By comparing patterns of homologous reactivity between CoVs and using targeted antibody-depletion experiments, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies that cross-recognize pandemic and endemic CoV antigens at two Spike S2 subunit epitopes. We further show that these cross-reactive antibodies preferentially bind endemic homologs. Our findings highlight sites at which the SARS-CoV-2 response appears to be shaped by previous CoV exposures and which have the potential to raise broadly neutralizing responses.

Abstract: Summary
Great advances have been made over the last four decades in therapeutic and diagnostic applications of antibodies. The activity maturation of antibody candidates, however, remains a significant challenge. To address this problem, we present a method that enables the systematic enhancement of the activity of a single-domain antibody through the post-translational installation of non-canonical side chains by chemical mutagenesis. We illustrate this approach by performing a structure-activity relationship study beyond the 20 naturally occurring amino acids on a single-domain antibody designed in silico to inhibit the aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide, a process closely linked to Alzheimer's disease. We found that this approach can improve, by five orders of magnitude, the anti-aggregation activity of the starting single-domain antibody, without affecting its stability. These results show that the expansion of the chemical space available to antibodies through chemical mutagenesis can be exploited for the systematic enhancement of the activity of these molecules.

Abstract: Survival and adaptation to oxidative stress is important for many organisms, and these occur through the activation of many different signaling pathways. In this report, we showed that Caenorhabditis (C.) elegans G protein–coupled receptor kinases modified the ability of the organism to resist oxidative stress. In acute oxidative stress studies using juglone, loss-of-function grk-2 mutants were more resistant to oxidative stress compared with loss-of-function grk-1 mutants and the wild-type N2 animals. This effect was Ce-AKT-1 dependent, suggesting that Ce-GRK2 adjusted C. elegans oxidative stress resistance through the IGF/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathway. Treating C. elegans with a GRK2 inhibitor, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine, resulted in increased acute oxidative stress resistance compared with another selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine. In chronic oxidative stress studies with paraquat, both grk-1 and grk-2 mutants had longer lifespan compared with the wild-type N2 animals in stress. In summary, this research showed the importance of both GRKs, especially GRK2, in modifying oxidative stress resistance.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been well-established to act as regulators and mediators of development and cell fate specification programs. LncRNA Mrhl (meiotic recombination hotspot locus) has been shown to act in a negative feedback loop with WNT signaling to regulate male germ cell meiotic commitment. In our current study, we have addressed the role of Mrhl in development and differentiation using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) as our model system of study. Mrhl is a nuclear-localized, chromatin-bound lncRNA with moderately stable expression in mESCs. Transcriptome analyses and loss-of-function phenotype studies revealed dysregulation of developmental processes, lineage-specific transcription factors and key networks along with aberrance in specification of early lineages during differentiation of mESCs. Genome-wide chromatin occupancy studies suggest regulation of chromatin architecture at key target loci through triplex formation. Our studies thus reveal a role for lncRNA Mrhl in regulating differentiation programs in mESCs in the context of appropriate cues through chromatin-mediated responses.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroinflammation characterizes multiple neurologic diseases, including primary inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis and classical neurodegenerative diseases. Aberrant activation of the innate immune system contributes to disease progression, but drugs modulating innate immunity, particularly within the central nervous system (CNS), are lacking. The CNS-penetrant natural product bryostatin-1 attenuates neuroinflammation by targeting innate myeloid cells. Supplies of natural bryostatin-1 are limited, but a recent scalable good manufacturing practice (GMP) synthesis has enabled access to it and its analogs (bryologs), the latter providing a path to more efficacious, better tolerated, and more accessible agents. Here, we show that multiple synthetically accessible bryologs replicate the anti-inflammatory effects of bryostatin-1 on innate immune cells in vitro, and a lead bryolog attenuates neuroinflammation in vivo, actions mechanistically dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) binding. Our findings identify bryologs as promising drug candidates for targeting innate immunity in neuroinflammation and create a platform for evaluation of synthetic PKC modulators in neuroinflammatory diseases.

Abstract: IL-6-triggered Th17 cell expansion is responsible for the pathogenesis of many immune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Traditionally, IL-6 induces Th17 cell differentiation through JAK-STAT3 signaling. In the present work, PKA inhibition reduces in vitro induction of Th17 cells, while IL-6 stimulation of T cells facilitates the internalization of A3AR and increased cAMP production in a GRK2 dependent manner. Inhibition of GRK2 by paroxetine (PAR) or genetic depletion of GRK2 restored A3AR distribution and prevented Th17 cell differentiation. Furthermore, in vivo PAR treatment effectively reduced the splenic Th17 cell proportion in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) which was accompanied by a significant improvement in clinical manifestations. These results indicate that IL-6-induced Th17 cell differentiation not only occurs through JAK-STAT3-RORγt but is also mediated through GRK2-A3AR-cAMP-PKA-CREB/ICER-RORγt. This elucidates the significance of GRK2-controlled cAMP signaling in the differentiation of Th17 cells and its potential application in treating Th17-driven immune diseases such as RA.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are commonly kept in a primed state but also able to acquire a more immature naive state under specific conditions in vitro. Acquisition of naive state changes several properties of hPSCs and might affect their contribution to embryonic development in vivo. However, the lack of an appropriate animal test system has made it difficult to assess potential differences for chimera formation between naive and primed hPSCs. Here, we report that the developing chicken embryo is a permissive host for hPSCs, allowing analysis of the pluripotency potential of hPSCs. Transplantation of naive-like and primed hPSCs at matched developmental stages resulted in robust chimerism. Importantly, the ability of naive-like but not of primed hPSCs to form chimera was substantially reduced when injected at non-matched developmental stages. We propose that contribution to chick embryogenesis is an informative and versatile test to identify different pluripotent states of hPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The impact of a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) on the drug treatment of intracranial tumors remains controversial. We characterize the BBB integrity in several intracranial tumor models using magnetic resonance imaging, fluorescent dyes, and autoradiography and determine the distribution and efficacy of docetaxel in brain tumors grafted in Abcb1-proficient and Abcb1-deficient mice. Leakiness of the tumor vasculature varies from extensive to absent. Regardless of the extent of leakiness, tumor blood vessels express ATP-binding cassette transporters (Abcb1 and Abcg2). A leaky vasculature results in higher docetaxel tumor levels compared to normal brain. Nevertheless, Abcb1 can reduce drug distribution and efficacy even in leaky models. Thus, BBB leakiness does not ensure the unimpeded access of ATP-binding cassette transporter substrate drugs. Therapeutic responses may be observed, but the full potential of such therapeutics may still be attenuated. Consequently, BBB-penetrable drugs with little to no affinity for efflux transporters are preferred for the treatment of intracranial tumors.

Abstract: Oxidative stress is one of the major and continuous stresses, an organism encounters during its lifetime. Tissues such as the brain, liver and muscles are more prone to damage by oxidative stress due to their metabolic activity, differences in physiological and adaptive processes. One of the defence mechanisms against continuous oxidative stress is a set of small heat shock proteins. αB-Crystallin/HSPB5, a small heat shock protein, gets upregulated under stress and acts as a molecular chaperone. In addition to acting as a molecular chaperone, HSPB5 is shown to have a role in other cytoprotective functions such as inhibition of apoptosis, prevention of oxidative stress and stabilisation of cytoskeletal system. Such protection in vivo, at the organism level, particularly in a tissue-dependent manner, has not been investigated. We have expressed HSPB5 in fat body (liver), neurons and specifically in dopaminergic and motor neurons in Drosophila and investigated its protective effect against paraquat-induced oxidative stress. We observed that expression of HSPB5 in neurons and fat body confers protection against paraquat-induced oxidative stress. Expression in dopaminergic neurons showed a higher protective effect. Our results clearly establish the protective ability of HSPB5 in vivo; the extent of protection, however, varies depending on the tissue in which it is expressed. Interestingly, neuronal expression of HSPB5 resulted in an improvement in negative geotropic behaviour, whereas specific expression in muscle tissue did not show such a beneficial effect.

Abstract: Summary
Tuberculosis (TB) is a heterogeneous disease manifesting in a subset of individuals infected with aerosolized Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Unlike human TB, murine infection results in uniformly high lung bacterial burdens and poorly organized granulomas. To develop a TB model that more closely resembles human disease, we infected mice with an ultra-low dose (ULD) of between 1–3 founding bacteria, reflecting a physiologic inoculum. ULD-infected mice exhibited highly heterogeneous bacterial burdens, well-circumscribed granulomas that shared features with human granulomas, and prolonged Mtb containment with unilateral pulmonary infection in some mice. We identified blood RNA signatures in mice infected with an ULD or a conventional Mtb dose (50–100 CFU) that correlated with lung bacterial burdens and predicted Mtb infection outcomes across species, including risk of progression to active TB in humans. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of the murine TB model and show that ULD infection recapitulates key features of human TB.

Abstract: The hallmark of atherogenesis is characterized as endothelial dysfunction and subsequent macrophage activation. Although our previous study has demonstrated that endothelin-1 (ET-1) plays an important role in atherogenesis, the underlying mechanism remains deeply investigation. Enhanced atherosclerotic plaques were observed in endothelium-specific ET-1 overexpression ApoE−/- mice (eET-1/ApoE−/-) concomitant with increased secretion of pro-inflammatory adhesion molecules and cytokines. The conditional media used for culturing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with AdET-1 infection and subjected to OX-LDL stimulation, was collected and utilized for bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) culturing. RT-PCR analysis showed increased genes expression related to classical M1 macrophages but decreased alternative activated M2 macrophages genes expression in macrophage culturing with the conditional media. Furthermore, consistent regulations of macrophage polarization were observed using isolated exosomes from the conditional media. More importantly, we noticed that miR-33 was enriched in the exosomes derived by HUVECs with AdET-1 infection, while bioinformatics analysis further indicated that miR-33 directly targeted NR4A and miR-33/NR4A axis was required for the effect of endothelial-specific ET-1 overexpression on pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. By contrast, such effects could be reversed by ET-1 knockdown. Taken together, our study indicated that the exosomes derived by HUVECs with AdET-1 infection can transfer miR-33 to macrophages and subsequently promote pro-inflammatory macrophage activation by directly targeting to NR4A. These evidences clearly revealed that miR-33/NR4A axis was the important mechanism underlying the effect of ET-1 on macrophage activation and indicated that ET-1 may act as a promising target for atherosclerosis management.

Abstract: Kidney Ankyrin Repeat-containing Proteins (KANKs) comprise a family of four evolutionary conserved proteins (KANK1 to 4) that localize to the belt of mature focal adhesions (FAs) where they regulate integrin-mediated adhesion, actomyosin contractility, and link FAs to the cortical microtubule stabilization complex (CMSC). The human KANK proteins were first identified in kidney and have been associated with kidney cancer and nephrotic syndrome. Here, we report the distributions and subcellular localizations of the four Kank mRNAs and proteins in mouse tissues. We found that the KANK family members display distinct and rarely overlapping expression patterns. Whereas KANK1 is expressed at the basal side of epithelial cells of all tissues tested, KANK2 expression is mainly observed at the plasma membrane and/or cytoplasm of mesenchymal cells and KANK3 exclusively in vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells. KANK4 shows the least widespread expression pattern and when present, overlaps with KANK2 in contractile cells, such as smooth muscle cells and pericytes. Our findings show that KANKs are widely expressed in a cell type-specific manner, which suggests that they have cell- and tissue-specific functions.

Abstract: The spike protein is a focused target of COVID-19, a pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. A 12-nt insertion at S1/S2 in the spike coding sequence yields a furin cleavage site, which raised controversy views on origin of the virus. Here we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of coronavirus spike proteins and mapped furin recognition motif on the tree. Furin cleavage sites occurred independently for multiple times in the evolution of the coronavirus family, supporting the natural occurring hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Bortezomib (Bort), a chemotherapeutic agent, is widely used for the clinical treatment of cancers. However, Bort-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (BIPN) significantly restricts its clinical application, which is difficult to deal with since the underlying mechanisms of BIPN are unclear. Here, we showed that Bort activates mTORC1 pathway leading to dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal apoptosis. Inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin or knockdown of raptor, regulatory-associated protein of mTORC1, with shRNA dramatically rescued the cells from Bort-caused apoptosis. In addition, we found that Bort-activated mTORC1 pathway was attributed to Bort elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is supported by the evidence that using ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) significantly alleviated Bort-activated mTORC1 pathway. Furthermore, we revealed that upregulation of NOX2 contributed to Bort-elicited ROS overproduction, leading to mTORC1 pathway-dependent apoptosis in DRG neurons. Inhibition of NOX2 with apocynin remarkably diminished Bort-induced overgeneration of ROS, activation of mTORC1 pathway and apoptosis in the cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Bort activation of mTORC1 pathway mediated by NOX2-drived ROS leads to apoptotic death in DRG neurons. Our findings highlight that manipulation of intracellular ROS level or NOX2 or mTORC1 activity may be exploited for prevention of BIPN.

Abstract: Identifying patient mutations driving skeletal development disorders has driven our understanding of bone development. Integrin adhesion deficiency disease is caused by a Kindlin-3 (fermitin family member 3) mutation, and its inactivation results in bleeding disorders and osteopenia. In this study, we uncover a role for Kindlin-3 in the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) down the chondrogenic lineage. Kindlin-3 expression increased with chondrogenic differentiation, similar to RUNX2. BMSCs isolated from a Kindlin-3 deficient patient expressed chondrocyte markers, including SOX9, under basal conditions, which were further enhanced with chondrogenic differentiation. Rescue of integrin activation by a constitutively activated β3 integrin construct increased adhesion to multiple extracellular matrices and reduced SOX9 expression to basal levels. Growth plates from mice expressing a mutated Kindlin-3 with the integrin binding site ablated demonstrated alterations in chondrocyte maturation similar to that seen with the human Kindlin-3 deficient BMSCs. These findings suggest that Kindlin-3 expression mirrors RUNX2 during chondrogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt signaling plays a central role in tissue maintenance and cancer. Wnt activates downstream genes through β-catenin, which interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors. A major question is how this signaling is coordinated relative to tissue organization and renewal. We used a recently described class of small molecules that binds tubulin to reveal a molecular cascade linking stress signaling through ATM, HIPK2, and p53 to the regulation of TCF/LEF transcriptional activity. These data suggest a mechanism by which mitotic and genotoxic stress can indirectly modulate Wnt responsiveness to exert coherent control over cell shape and renewal. These findings have implications for understanding tissue morphogenesis and small-molecule anticancer therapeutics.

Abstract: DEAD-box RNA helicase 46 (DDX46) has recently been identified as a candidate oncogene in several types of human malignancies. To date, the role of DDX46 in gastric cancer has not been determined. The purpose of the current study was to explore the role of DDX46 in gastric cancer and the potential mechanism. DDX46-silecing or overexpressing gastric cancer cell lines were established to validate the role of DDX46. Our results showed that the expression of DDX46 was significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of DDX46 suppressed the proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Whereas, DDX46 overexpression enhanced the cell proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, knockdown of DDX46 markedly suppressed the tumor growth of xenografts. Research into the mechanism revealed that DDX46 depletion inhibited the Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells. Notably, activation of Akt or β-catenin overexpression reversed the DDX46 depletion-mediated anti-cancer effect. In conclusion, these findings indicated that DDX46 exerted an oncogenic role in gastric cancer via regulating the Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. Thus, DDX46 might be utilized as a therapeutic anti-cancer target.

Abstract: Background
NIMA-related kinase-7 (NEK7) is a serine/threonine kinase that drives cell-cycle dynamics by modulating mitotic spindle formation and cytokinesis. It is also a crucial modulator of the pro-inflammatory effects of NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. However, the role of NEK7 in microglia/macrophages post-spinal cord injury (SCI) is not well defined.
Methods
In this study, we performed both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Using an in vivo mouse SCI model, NEK7 siRNAs were administered intraspinally. For in vitro analysis, BV-2 microglia cells with NEK7-siRNA were stimulated with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 2 mM Adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
Results
Here, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of NEK7 and NLRP3 inflammasomes were upregulated in spinal cord tissues of injured mice and BV-2 microglia cells exposed to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Further experiments established that NEK7 and NLRP3 interacted in BV-2 microglia cells, an effect that was eliminated following NEK7 ablation. Moreover, NEK7 ablation suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Although NEK7 inhibition did not significantly improve motor function post-SCI in mice, it was found to attenuate local inflammatory response and inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia/macrophages of the injured spinal cord.
Conclusion
NEK7 amplifies NLRP3 inflammasome pro-inflammatory signaling in BV-2 microglia cells and mice models of SCI. Therefore, agents targeting the NEK7/NLRP3 signaling offers great promise in the treatment of inflammatory response post-SCI.

Abstract: Summary
Being integral primary producers in diverse ecosystems, microalgal genomes could be mined for ecological insights, but representative genome sequences are lacking for many phyla. We cultured and sequenced 107 microalgae species from 11 different phyla indigenous to varied geographies and climates. This collection was used to resolve genomic differences between saltwater and freshwater microalgae. Freshwater species showed domain-centric ontology enrichment for nuclear and nuclear membrane functions, while saltwater species were enriched in organellar and cellular membrane functions. Further, marine species contained significantly more viral families in their genomes (p = 8e–4). Sequences from Chlorovirus, Coccolithovirus, Pandoravirus, Marseillevirus, Tupanvirus, and other viruses were found integrated into the genomes of algal from marine environments. These viral-origin sequences were found to be expressed and code for a wide variety of functions. Together, this study comprehensively defines the expanse of protein-coding and viral elements in microalgal genomes and posits a unified adaptive strategy for algal halotolerance.

Abstract: Rab30 is a poorly characterized small GTPase. Here we show that Rab30 is localised primarily to the TGN and recycling endosomes in a range of cell types, including primary neurons; minor levels of Rab30 were also detected throughout the Golgi stack and early endosomes. Silencing of Rab30 resulted in the dispersal of both early and recycling endosomes and TGN compartments in HeLa cells. By analyzing cargo trafficking in Rab30-silenced and Rab30-overexpressing HeLa cells, we demonstrate that Rab30 plays a role in retrograde trafficking of TGN38 from endosomes to the Golgi, but has no apparent role in the endocytic recycling of the transferrin receptor to the plasma membrane. Five interactive partners with Rab30 were identified by pull-down and MS analysis using GFP-tagged Rab30 mutant, Rab30(Q68L). Two of the interactive partners identified were Arf1 and Arf4, known regulators of endosome to TGN retrograde transport. Knockdown of Arf1 and Arf4 results in GFP-Rab30 decorated tubules arising from the recycling endosomes, suggesting association of Rab30 with tubular carriers. Overall our data demonstrates a role for Rab30 in regulating retrograde transport to the TGN and maintenance of endosomal-TGN organization.

Abstract: Summary
Chordomas are rare spinal tumors addicted to expression of the developmental transcription factor brachyury. In chordomas, brachyury is super-enhancer associated and preferentially downregulated by pharmacologic transcriptional CDK inhibition, leading to cell death. To understand the underlying basis of this sensitivity, we dissect the brachyury transcription regulatory network and compare the consequences of brachyury degradation with transcriptional CDK inhibition. Brachyury defines the chordoma super-enhancer landscape and autoregulates through binding its super-enhancer, and its locus forms a transcriptional condensate. Transcriptional CDK inhibition and brachyury degradation disrupt brachyury autoregulation, leading to loss of its transcriptional condensate and transcriptional program. Compared with transcriptional CDK inhibition, which globally downregulates transcription, leading to cell death, brachyury degradation is much more selective, inducing senescence and sensitizing cells to anti-apoptotic inhibition. These data suggest that brachyury downregulation is a core tenet of transcriptional CDK inhibition and motivates developing strategies to target brachyury and its autoregulatory feedback loop.

Abstract: The Hsp90 molecular chaperone is required for the function of hundreds of different cellular proteins. Hsp90 and a cohort of interacting proteins called cochaperones interact with clients in an ATP-dependent cycle. Cochaperone functions include targeting clients to Hsp90, regulating Hsp90 ATPase activity, and/or promoting Hsp90 conformational changes as it progresses through the cycle. Over the last 20 years, the list of cochaperones identified in human cells has grown from the initial six identified in complex with steroid hormone receptors and protein kinases to about fifty different cochaperones found in Hsp90-client complexes. These cochaperones may be placed into three groups based on shared Hsp90 interaction domains. Available evidence indicates that cochaperones vary in client specificity, abundance, and tissue distribution. Many of the cochaperones have critical roles in regulation of cancer and neurodegeneration. A more limited set of cochaperones have cellular functions that may be limited to tissues such as muscle and testis. It is likely that a small set of cochaperones are part of the core Hsp90 machinery required for the folding of a wide range of clients. The presence of more selective cochaperones may allow greater control of Hsp90 activities across different tissues or during development.

Abstract: Summary
DCP2 is an RNA-decapping enzyme that controls the stability of human RNAs that encode factors functioning in transcription and the immune response. While >1,800 human DCP2 substrates have been identified, compensatory expression changes secondary to genetic ablation of DCP2 have complicated a complete mapping of its regulome. Cell-permeable, selective chemical inhibitors of DCP2 could provide a powerful tool to study DCP2 specificity. Here, we report phage display selection of CP21, a bicyclic peptide ligand to DCP2. CP21 has high affinity and selectivity for DCP2 and inhibits DCP2 decapping activity toward selected RNA substrates in human cells. CP21 increases formation of P-bodies, liquid condensates enriched in intermediates of RNA decay, in a manner that resembles the deletion or mutation of DCP2. We used CP21 to identify 76 previously unreported DCP2 substrates. This work demonstrates that DCP2 inhibition can complement genetic approaches to study RNA decay.

Abstract: Summary
T cells are involved in control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To establish the patterns of immunodominance of different SARS-CoV-2 antigens and precisely measure virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we study epitope-specific T cell responses of 99 convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is probed using 1,925 peptides spanning the entire genome, ensuring an unbiased coverage of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles for class II responses. For HLA class I, we study an additional 5,600 predicted binding epitopes for 28 prominent HLA class I alleles, accounting for wide global coverage. We identify several hundred HLA-restricted SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes. Distinct patterns of immunodominance are observed, which differ for CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and antibodies. The class I and class II epitopes are combined into epitope megapools to facilitate identification and quantification of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Optically controlled chemical reagents, termed “photopharmaceuticals,” are powerful tools for precise spatiotemporal control of proteins particularly when genetic methods, such as knockouts or optogenetics are not viable options. However, current photopharmaceutical scaffolds, such as azobenzenes are intolerant of GFP/YFP imaging and are metabolically labile, posing severe limitations for biological use. We rationally designed a photoswitchable "SBT" scaffold to overcome these problems, then derivatized it to create exceptionally metabolically robust and fully GFP/YFP-orthogonal "SBTub" photopharmaceutical tubulin inhibitors. Lead compound SBTub3 allows temporally reversible, cell-precise, and even subcellularly precise photomodulation of microtubule dynamics, organization, and microtubule-dependent processes. By overcoming the previous limitations of microtubule photopharmaceuticals, SBTubs offer powerful applications in cell biology, and their robustness and druglikeness are favorable for intracellular biological control in in vivo applications. We furthermore expect that the robustness and imaging orthogonality of the SBT scaffold will inspire other derivatizations directed at extending the photocontrol of a range of other biological targets.

Abstract: Radiotherapy is a conventional approach for anti-cancer treatment, killing tumor cells through damaging cellular DNA. While increasing studies have demonstrated that tumors generated the tolerance to radiation and tumor immune system was found to be correlated to radiotherapy resistance. Therefore, it is critical to identify potential immune factors associated with the efficacy of radiotherapy. Here in this study, we evaluated the sensitivities of different tumor cells to radiation and determined HEp-2 cells as the radio-resistant tumor cells for further investigation. IFNgamma as a key regulator of host immune response showed the potential to sensitize tumors to ionizing radiation (IR). Besides, IFNgamma-induced CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) was found to be necessary for effective IR-induced killing of cultured HEp-2 cells. Increased clonogenic survival was observed in CXCL10-depleted HEp-2 cells and CXCL10-KO cells. Additionally, the loss of CXCL10 in HEp-2 cells showed less progression of the G0/G1 phase to G2/M when exposed to IR (8 Gy). Local IR (20 Gy) to nude mice bearing HEp-2 tumors significantly reduced tumor burden, while fewer effects on tumor burden in mice carrying CXCL10-KO tumors were observed. We furtherly evaluated the possible roles the chemokine receptor CXCR3 plays in mediating the sensitivity of cultured HEp-2 cells to IR. Altered expression of CXCR3 in HEp-2 cells affected IR-induced killing of HEp-2 cells. Our data suggest the IFNgamma-activated CXCL10/CXCR3 axis may contribute to the effective radiation-induced killing of HEp-2 cells in vitro.

Abstract: The use of chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR T cells) is an effective therapy for advanced cancer, especially hematological malignancies, and this method has attracted widespread attention in the last several years. The type, number and vitality of the effector cells clearly play important roles in this approach. In this study, to expand the possibility of curing cancer through adoptive cell therapy (ACT), we developed a novel method for effectively obtaining abundant T cells in vitro. The fusion proteins of three cytokines, SA-hIL-2, SA-hIL-7 and SA-hIL-21, were anchored onto biotin magnetic beads to increase the number of cytokines on the surface of the magnetic beads, which increased the local concentration of cytokines and thus promoted the binding of cytokines to T cells. Next, we examined the effects of these modified magnetic beads on the proliferation rate of T cells and CD19 CAR T cells. In this study, we report the expression and purification of the active bifunctional fusion proteins SA-hIL-2, SA-hIL-7 and SA-hIL-21, which were bound to biotin magnetic beads to develop a platform that was employed to increase the local concentration of cytokines. When the cells had been cultured for 14 days, the proliferation rate of the CD3+ T cells in the group that received cytokine-coupled biotin magnetic beads (Beads-SA-CK) was higher than that of the cells in the groups that received soluble cytokines (Soluble-SA-CK) and that of the cells in the standard group (Standard-CK). We speculate that this difference may be the result of the increased expression of Bcl-2 and the increased phosphorylation of Stat5. Moreover, our results preliminarily indicate that compared with the other two treatments, Soluble-SA-CK and Standard-CK, adding cytokine-coupled biotin magnetic beads more effectively increases the proliferation rate of CD19 CAR-T cells. As expected, the CD19 CAR-T cells stimulated by Beads-SA-CK had a stronger anticancer effect than the cells stimulated by the other two treatments. An effective method of preparing abundant T cells in vitro was developed, and it may provide a novel strategy for ACT.

Abstract: In anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) genetic predisposition, ANCA autoantibodies, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), complement activation, and toll-like receptor signaling are implicated in AAV pathogenesis. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), a highly conserved group of small-sized molecular chaperones, take part in protein folding during cellular stress. Although HSPs were initially observed intracellularly, it has been shown that they can be secreted in the extracellular space and modulate the immune response in various autoimmune diseases including AAV. The scope of the present study is to investigate the role of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and 70 (HSP70) in the long renal effects in an ANCA vasculitis cohort. In this cohort of ANCA-associated vasculitis, 29 patients were followed up over 20 years. At diagnosis, immunohistochemistry was performed for HSP60 and HSP70 within the various nephron compartments. Higher renal HSP60 expression was associated with increased interstitial inflammatory infiltrates at diagnosis, while HSP70 expression was associated with a greater extent of interstitial fibrosis at diagnosis. Notably, intense tissue expression of HSP70 at the time of biopsy was associated with a worsened kidney survival. Renal HSP70 expression was associated with poor renal outcomes during long-term follow-up. This finding may indicate a role of HSPs in renal disease progression in ANCA vasculitis. Further validating studies are needed to verify a causative association between HSP70 expression and renal outcomes in ANCA-associated vasculitis.

Abstract: Artificial gravity is a potential countermeasure to attenuate effects of weightlessness during long-term spaceflight, including losses of muscle mass and function, possibly to some extent attributable to disturbed neuromuscular interaction. The 60-day AGBRESA bed-rest study was conducted with 24 participants (16 men, 8 women; 33 ± 9 years; 175 ± 9 cm; 74 ± 10 kg; 8 control group, 8 continuous (cAG) and 8 intermittent (iAG) centrifugation) to assess the impact of bed rest with or without daily 30-min continuous/intermittent centrifugation with 1G at the centre of mass. Fasting blood samples were collected before and on day 6, 20, 40 and 57 during 6° head-down tilt bed rest. Concentrations of circulating markers of muscle wasting (GDF-8/myostatin; slow skeletal muscle troponin T; prostaglandin E2), neurotrophic factors (BDNF; GDNF) and C-terminal Agrin Fragment (CAF) were determined by ELISAs. Creatine kinase activity was assessed by colorimetric enzyme assay. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted with TIME as within-subject, and INTERVENTION and SEX as between-subject factors. The analyses revealed no significant effect of bed rest or sex on any of the parameters. Continuous or intermittent artificial gravity is a safe intervention that does not have a negative impact of the neuromuscular secretome.

Abstract: Purpose
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a highly fatal gynecological cancer. A long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) gastric cancer-associated lncRNA1 (GClnc1) has been revealed to play critical roles in metastasis. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the correlation between GClnc1 and the metastasis and progression of EOC.
Methods
First, 57 paired EOC and paracancerous tissues were collected to detect GClnc1 expression by RT-qPCR. Subsequently, OVC1 and SKOV3 cells with GClnc1 silencing/overexpression were developed to detect changes in cell activity, apoptosis, migration and invasion abilities. Then, the subcellular localization of GClnc1 was detected by nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation, ISH and FISH assays. The binding relationships between GClnc1 and forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2), and between FOXC2 and NOTCH1 were predicted and verified.
Results
GClnc1 was significantly overexpressed in EOC tissues, and knockdown of GClnc1 inhibited cell viability and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, GClnc1 in the nucleus bound to the transcription factor FOXC2, thereby activating the transcription of NOTCH1. NOTCH1 overexpression enhanced the proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of SKOV3 and OVC1 cells. Moreover, NOTCH1 activated the NF-κB/Snail signaling. Finally, in vivo experiments demonstrated that GClnc1 knockdown suppressed the growth and metastasis of SKOV3 and OVC1 cells in vivo.
Conclusions
GClnc1 promoted NOTCH1 transcription by recruiting FOXC2, thereby activating the NF-κB/Snail signaling and promoting EOC cell growth and metastasis.

Abstract: Communication of vascular cells is essential for the control of organotypic functions of blood vessels. In this context, vascular endothelial cells (EC) act as potent regulators of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) functions such as contraction and relaxation. However, the impact of ECs on the gene expression pattern of VSMCs is largely unknown. Here, we investigated changes of the VSMC transcriptome by utilizing 3D human vascular organoids organized as a core of VSMCs enclosed by a monolayer of ECs. Microarray-based analyses indicated that interaction with ECs for 48 h down-regulates expression of genes in VSMCs controlling rate-limiting steps of the cholesterol biosynthesis such as HMGCR, HMGCS1, DHCR24 and DHCR7. Protein analyses revealed a decrease in the abundance of DHCR24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase) and lower cholesterol levels in VSMCs co-cultured with ECs. On the functional level, the blockade of the DHCR24 activity impaired adhesion, migration and proliferation of VSMCs. Collectively, these findings indicate that ECs have the capacity to instruct VSMCs to shut down the expression of DHCR24 thereby limiting their cholesterol biosynthesis, which may support their functional steady state.

Abstract: Chemoresistance is a tremendous challenge to efficacy of systemic chemotherapy which is the preferred treatment for the advanced CRC patients. More tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are recruited into the CRC tumor under chemotherapy, which are highly implicated in the chemoresistance development, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we present that activated HIF1α signaling in CRC cells under chemotherapy drives the expression of HMGB1to promotes macrophage infiltration and in turn chemoresistance development. Chemotherapeutic treatment with 5-FU leads to increased recruitment of macrophages into tumors, which display tumor-protective alternative activation. Mechanistically, tumor HIF1α signaling activated by chemo-induced ROS drives the transcription of HMGB1 to promote more macrophage infiltration into CRC tumor. Furthermore, high levels of GDF15 produced by TAMs impair the chemosensitity of tumor cells via enhancing fatty acids β-oxidation. Together, our current study reveals a new insight into the cross-talking between tumor cells and immune cells, and provides novel drug targets for clinic treatments for CRC.

Abstract: Ovarian metastases exfoliate from the primary tumor and it is thought that aggregation supports their survival in the peritoneal cavity during dissemination but the underlying mechanisms are not clearly identified. We have previously shown that ovarian cancer cells acquire an increasingly glycolytic and metabolic flexible phenotype during progression. In the present study, we investigated how hypoxia, aggregation, and the incorporation of the obese stromal vascular fraction (SVF) affect cellular metabolism and the response to common anti-cancer and anti-diabetic drugs. Our results show a reduction of glucose uptake, lactate secretion, cellular respiration and ATP synthesis in response to hypoxia and aggregation, suggesting that the observed reduced proliferation of cells aggregated into spheroids is the result of a down-regulation of respiration. Recruitment of SVF to spheroids increased the spheroids invasive capacity but reduced respiration only in the most aggressive cells. Further, aggregation and hypoxia reduced the response to the metabolic drugs AICAR and metformin, and the chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin and paclitaxel. Our results suggest that the adaptation of cellular metabolism may contribute to enhanced survival under non-permissive conditions, and that these metabolic alterations may provide targets for future interventions that aim to enhance the survival of women with metastatic ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins exist in distinct multi-protein complexes and play a central role in silencing developmental genes, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that deficiency of retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4), a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) leads to spontaneous differentiation into mesendodermal lineages. We further show that Rbbp4 and core PRC2 share an important number of common genomic targets, encoding regulators involved in early germ layer specification. Moreover, we find that Rbbp4 is absolutely essential for genomic targeting of PRC2 to a subset of developmental genes. Interestingly, we demonstrate that Rbbp4 is necessary for sustaining the expression of Oct4 and Sox2 and that the forced co-expression of Oct4 and Sox2 fully rescues the pluripotency of Rbbp4-null ESCs. Therefore, our study indicates that Rbbp4 links maintenance of the pluripotency regulatory network with repression of mesendoderm lineages.

Abstract: Summary
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses an unprecedented public health crisis. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulation of the immune system. However, the unique signature of early immune responses remains elusive. We characterized the transcriptome of rhesus macaques and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Alarmin S100A8 was robustly induced in SARS-CoV-2-infected animal models as well as in COVID-19 patients. Paquinimod, a specific inhibitor of S100A8/A9, could rescue the pneumonia with substantial reduction of viral loads in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Remarkably, Paquinimod treatment resulted in almost 100% survival in a lethal model of mouse coronavirus infection using the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). A group of neutrophils that contributes to the uncontrolled pathological damage and onset of COVID-19 was dramatically induced by coronavirus infection. Paquinimod treatment could reduce these neutrophils and regain anti-viral responses, unveiling key roles of S100A8/A9 and aberrant neutrophils in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
In humans, lysophosphatidylserines (lyso-PSs) are potent lipid regulators of important immunological processes. Given their structural diversity and commercial paucity, here we report the synthesis of methyl esters of lyso-PS (Me-lyso-PSs) containing medium- to very-long-chain (VLC) lipid tails. We show that Me-lyso-PSs are excellent substrates for the lyso-PS lipase ABHD12, and that these synthetic lipids are acted upon by cellular carboxylesterases to produce lyso-PSs. Next, in macrophages we demonstrate that VLC lyso-PSs orchestrate pro-inflammatory responses and in turn neuroinflammation via a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent pathway. We also show that long-chain (LC) lyso-PSs robustly induce intracellular cyclic AMP production, cytosolic calcium influx, and phosphorylation of the nodal extracellular signal-regulated kinase to regulate macrophage activation via a TLR2-independent pathway. Finally, we report that LC lyso-PSs potently elicit histamine release during the mast cell degranulation process, and that ABHD12 is the major lyso-PS lipase in these immune cells.

Abstract: Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and heat shock proteins (HSPs) are ubiquitous proteins that are functional mediators in both normal and stressed states of the cell. In this study, we performed heat stress (37 °C) experiments on turbot kidney (TK) cells. Heat stress expression patterns of HSP90, as well as the expression and phosphorylation levels of extracellular-regulated signal kinases (ERKs) and the transcription factor HSF1 and c-Fos, were examined. The results show that heat stress activates ERK1/2 and HSF1, and induces HSP90 gene expression in TK cells. Inhibition of ERK activation attenuates heat stress-induced HSP90 gene expression. The double luciferase reporter gene experiment showed that HSF1 is an important transcription factor for heat-induced HSP90 gene expression. Likewise, c-Fos does not directly regulate the heat-induced expression of HSP90 in turbot kidney cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a signaling pathway that regulates the heat shock response in turbot cells. Our results may facilitate an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of the cellular stress response in marine fish.

Abstract: Summary
Serotonin receptor 6 (5-HT6R), a typical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) mainly expressed in the neurogenic area with constitutive activity, is of particular interest as a promising target for emotional impairment. Here, we found that 5-HT6R was highly expressed in human NSCs and activation of the receptor promoted self-renewal of human NSCs, and thus induced the expansion and folding of human cerebral organoids; dysfunction of receptor or inhibition of its constitutive activity resulted in the premature differentiation of NSCs, which ultimately depleted the NSC pool. The following mechanistic study revealed that EPAC-CREB signaling was involved in 5-HT6R regulation. Furthermore, we showed that mice with genetic deletion of 5-HT6R or knockin A268R mutant presented depression-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis for progressive decrease of the NSC pool. Thus, this study indicates that the modulation of 5-HT6R and its constitutive activity may provide a therapeutic alternative to alleviate depression.

Abstract: Summary
Glycans, the most diverse biopolymer, are shaped by evolutionary pressures stemming from host-microbe interactions. Here, we present machine learning and bioinformatics methods to leverage the evolutionary information present in glycans to gain insights into how pathogens and commensals interact with hosts. By using techniques from natural language processing, we develop deep-learning models for glycans that are trained on a curated dataset of 19,299 unique glycans and can be used to study and predict glycan functions. We show that these models can be utilized to predict glycan immunogenicity and the pathogenicity of bacterial strains, as well as investigate glycan-mediated immune evasion via molecular mimicry. We also develop glycan-alignment methods and use these to analyze virulence-determining glycan motifs in the capsular polysaccharides of bacterial pathogens. These resources enable one to identify and study glycan motifs involved in immunogenicity, pathogenicity, molecular mimicry, and immune evasion, expanding our understanding of host-microbe interactions.

Abstract: DNA N6-methyladenine (N6-mA) was recently recognized as a new epigenetic modification in mammalian genome, and ALKBH1 was discovered as its demethylase. Knock-out mice studies revealed that ALKBH1 was indispensable for normal embryonic development. However, the function of ALKBH1 in myogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we found that N6-mA showed a steady increase, going along with a strong decrease of ALKBH1 during skeletal muscle development. Our results also showed that ALKBH1 enhanced proliferation and inhibited differentiation of C2C12 cells. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis and reporter assays further revealed that ALKBH1 accomplished the differentiation inhibiting function by regulating a core set of genes and multiple signaling pathways, including increasing chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 (CXCL14) and activating ERK signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrated that ALKBH1 is critical for the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells, and suggested that N6-mA might be a new epigenetic mechanism for the regulation of myogenesis.

Abstract: Nuclear SOX9 is essential for Sertoli cell differentiation and the development of a testis. Exposure of Sertoli cells to exogenous oestrogen causes cytoplasmic retention of SOX9, inhibiting testis development and promoting ovarian development. The cytoplasmic localisation of SOX9 requires a stabilised microtubule network and a key MAPK complex, ERK1/2, is responsive to oestrogen and known to affect the microtubule network. We hypothesised that oestrogen could stabilise microtubules through the activation of ERK1/2 to promote the cytoplasmic retention of SOX9. Treatment of human testis-derived NT2/D1 cells for 30 min with oestrogen rapidly activated ERK1/2, stabilised the microtubule network and increased cytoplasmic localisation of SOX9. The effects of oestrogen on SOX9 and tubulin were blocked by the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126, demonstrating that ERK1/2 mediates the stabilisation of microtubules and cytoplasmic retention of SOX9 by oestrogen. Together, these data revealed a previously unknown mechanism for oestrogen in impacting MAPK signalling to block SOX9 bioavailability and the differentiation of Sertoli cells.

Abstract: Emerging studies revealed that a poor intrauterine environment elicited by maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) is associated with an increased risk of metabolic diseases in adulthood. Previous research has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) exert pivotal roles in modulating molecular pathways involved in disease pathogenesis and progression. In this respect, we herein examined miRNA profiles in samples of liver from offspring whose mothers were fed either with a 50% food-restricted diet or standard laboratory chow during pregnancy. Our findings enumerated that miR-181a, involved in lipid metabolism, was found to be downregulated in the liver of MNR offspring at 1 day of age when compared to that of control offspring. We also noted that overexpression of miR-181a reduced the lipid droplets after treatment with oleic acid for 48 h, which suppressed the expressions levels of SIRT1, FOXO1, KLF6 and PPARγ in BRL-3A cells, while the opposite results were observed with decreased expression of miR-181a. Furthermore, the luciferase reporter assay confirmed the direct interactions between miR-181a with KLF6 and SIRT1. In adults, the MNR offspring elucidated increased TG content, decreased expression of miR-181a, and increased expressions levels of SIRT1, FOXO1, KLF6, and PPARγ in liver tissues. Collectively, these findings provided novel evidence that MNR could regulate miRNAs expression, which might be related to lipid metabolism in MNR offspring.

Abstract: Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation induces skin damage and photoaging through several deleterious effects, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis of epidermal cells, inflammation, and collagen degradation in fibroblasts. Ergothioneine (EGT) is a naturally occurring amino acid with potential biological properties. We evaluated whether EGT protects against UVB-induced photoaging using a keratinocyte/fibroblast co-culture system. Keratinocytes were pretreated with EGT, irradiated with UVB, and co-cultured with fibroblasts. In keratinocytes, ROS production and apoptosis were assessed. We also analyzed the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, HSP70, proapoptotic proteins, and paracrine cytokines by Western blotting and real-time PCR. Collagen degradation-related genes and senescence were also assessed in fibroblasts. EGT pretreatment of keratinocytes significantly inhibited downregulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and HSP70, and protected keratinocytes by suppressing production of ROS and cleavage of proapoptotic proteins, including caspase-8 and PARP. Furthermore, EGT significantly reduced the paracrine cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. In co-cultures of fibroblasts with EGT-treated keratinocytes, the expression levels of collagen degradation-related genes and fibroblast senescence were significantly decreased; however, synthesis of procollagen type I was significantly increased. Our results confirm that EGT suppresses the modification of collagen homeostasis in fibroblasts by preventing downregulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and HSP70 in keratinocytes following UVB irradiation.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) can be induced by virus infection. In this part, we explored whether Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection could induce ER stress in differentiated THP-1 (dTHP-1) cells. It showed that the mRNA and protein levels of ER stress-related 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78, HSPA5) and mRNA levels of X box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1), activating transcription factor 6(ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) after HTNV infection, were significantly higher than that in uninfected control group. However, the mRNA levels of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94, HSPC4), and inositol-requiring enzyme1 (IRE1) were not significantly different between the infected group and the untreated group in 2 h after virus infection. It is unusual in activating GRP78 but not GRP94. Meanwhile, dTHP-1 cells infected with HTNV at 12 h did not show obvious apoptosis. These results indicated that the HTNV infection could induce the unfolded protein response (UPR) in dTHP-1 cells, without directly leading to cell apoptosis during 12 h after virus infection.

Abstract: Summary
After reprogramming to naive pluripotency, human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) still exhibit very low ability to make interspecies chimeras. Whether this is because they are inherently devoid of the attributes of chimeric competency or because naive PSCs cannot colonize embryos from distant species remains to be elucidated. Here, we have used different types of mouse, human, and rhesus monkey naive PSCs and analyzed their ability to colonize rabbit and cynomolgus monkey embryos. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remained mitotically active and efficiently colonized host embryos. In contrast, primate naive PSCs colonized host embryos with much lower efficiency. Unlike mouse ESCs, they slowed DNA replication after dissociation and, after injection into host embryos, they stalled in the G1 phase and differentiated prematurely, regardless of host species. We conclude that human and non-human primate naive PSCs do not efficiently make chimeras because they are inherently unfit to remain mitotically active during colonization.

Abstract: Summary
Most of our current knowledge regarding early lineage specification and embryo-derived stem cells comes from studies in rodent models. However, key gaps remain in our understanding of these developmental processes from nonrodent species. Here, we report the detailed characterization of pig extraembryonic endoderm (pXEN) cells, which can be reliably and reproducibly generated from primitive endoderm (PrE) of blastocyst. Highly expandable pXEN cells express canonical PrE markers and transcriptionally resemble rodent XENs. The pXEN cells contribute both to extraembryonic tissues including visceral yolk sac as well as embryonic gut when injected into host blastocysts, and generate live offspring when used as a nuclear donor in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). The pXEN cell lines provide a novel model for studying lineage segregation, as well as a source for genome editing in livestock.

Abstract: Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients. To migrate to distant sites, cancer cells would need to adapt their behaviour in response to different tissue environments. Thus, it is essential to study this process in models that can closely replicate the tumour microenvironment. Here, we evaluate the use of organotypic liver and brain slices to study cancer metastasis. Morphological and viability parameters of the slices were monitored daily over 3 days in culture to assess their stability as a realistic 3D tissue platform for in vitro metastatic assays. Using these slices, we evaluated the invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and of a subpopulation that was selected for increased motility. We show that the more aggressive invasion of the selected cells likely resulted not only from their lower stiffness, but also from their lower adhesion to the surrounding tissue. Different invasion patterns in the brain and liver slices were observed for both subpopulations. Cells migrated faster in the brain slices (with an amoeboid-like mode) compared to in the liver slices (where they migrated with mesenchymal or collective migration-like modes). Inhibition of the Ras/MAPK/ERK pathway increased cell stiffness and adhesion forces, which resulted in reduced invasiveness. These results illustrate the potential for organotypic tissue slices to more closely mimic in vivo conditions during cancer cell metastasis than most in vitro models.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal epithelium senses nutritional and microbial stimuli using epithelial sensory enteroendocrine cells (EEC). EECs communicate nutritional information to the nervous system, but whether they also relay signals from intestinal microbes remains unknown. Using in vivo real-time measurements of EEC and nervous system activity in zebrafish, we discovered that the bacteria Edwardsiella tarda activate EECs through the receptor transient receptor potential ankyrin A1 (Trpa1) and increase intestinal motility. Microbial, pharmacological, or optogenetic activation of Trpa1+EECs directly stimulates vagal sensory ganglia and activates cholinergic enteric neurons by secreting the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). A subset of indole derivatives of tryptophan catabolism produced by E. tarda and other gut microbes activates zebrafish EEC Trpa1 signaling. These catabolites also directly stimulate human and mouse Trpa1 and intestinal 5-HT secretion. These results establish a molecular pathway by which EECs regulate enteric and vagal neuronal pathways in response to microbial signals.

Phosphorylation-regulated HMGA1a-P53 interaction unveils the function of HMGA1a acidic tail phosphorylations via synthetic proteins,

Abstract: Summary
As a typical member of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), HMGA1a carries many post-translational modifications (PTMs). To study the undefined function of acidic tail phosphorylations, seven HMGA1a proteins with site-specific modification(s) were chemically synthesized via Ser/Thr ligation. We found that the phosphorylations significantly inhibit HMGA1a-P53 interaction and the phosphorylations can induce conformational change of HMGA1a from an “open state” to a “close state.” Notably, the positively charged lysine-arginine (KR) clusters are responsible for modulating HMGA1a conformation via electrostatic interaction with the phosphorylated acidic tail. Finally, we used a synthetic protein-affinity purification mass spectrometry (SP-AP-MS) methodology to profile the specific interactors, which further supported the function of HMGA1a phosphorylation. Collectively, this study highlights a mechanism for regulating IDPs' conformation and function by phosphorylation of non-protein-binding domain and showcases that the protein chemical synthesis in combination with mass spectrometry can serve as an efficient tool to study the IDPs' PTMs.
