Abstract: We developed shape-stabilized phase change composites (PCCs) for building materials with high heat-storage density by vacuum impregnation of the phase change material (PCM) octadecane into mesoporous SiO2. We examined the effects of the average pore size of mesoporous SiO2 on the melting point and latent heat of the PCCs. Cyclic tests of melting and freezing were performed to evaluate leakage and degradation of the PCCs. The thermophysical properties of the PCCs were measured by differential scanning calorimetry, and the following results were obtained: (1) The impregnation ratio of the composites was above 0.95; therefore, almost all pores were completely filled with PCM. (2) The melting point of the PCMs decreased with decreasing average pore diameter, and the melting point was established as a function of average pore diameter from the Gibbs–Thomson equation, taking into account the existence of a nonfreezing layer on the surface of the pore wall. (3) The octadecane/mesoporous SiO2 composites retained the full amount of impregnated PCM, even after cyclic heating and cooling.

Abstract: Follicular atresia mainly results from apoptosis of granulosa cells (GCs). Our previous microRNA array data indicated that the miRNA let-7g level increases significantly during porcine ovary follicular atresia. It is uncertain if GCs apoptosis is mediated by microRNA let-7g. In this study, the expression levels of the apoptosis-associated genes CASP3, BAX and BIM were significantly upregulated when let-7g mimic was transfected into porcine GCs, and the anti-apoptotic genes BCL-2 and MCL-1 were significantly downregulated. The apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometry, and our results indicated that let-7g significantly enhanced GCs apoptosis. In further studies, we found that overexpression of let-7g induced the expression of FoxO1 in GCs and led to nuclear accumulation of dephosphorylated FoxO1. In addition, the effect of let-7g on FoxO1 expression and dephosphorylation resulted from repression of the expression of the MAP3K1 gene in porcine GCs. The site on MAP3K1 mRNA targeted by let-7g was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. The anti-apoptotic effect of MAP3K1 was validated by silencing MAP3K1 using small interfering RNA technology. In conclusion, our data indicate that let-7g induces porcine GCs apoptosis by inhibiting the MAP3K1 gene, which promotes FoxO1 expression and dephosphorylation with nuclear accumulation.

Abstract: TIMAP (TGF-β inhibited membrane associated protein) is a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunit highly abundant in endothelial cells and it is involved in the maintenance of pulmonary endothelial barrier function. It localizes mainly in the plasma membrane, but it is also present in the nuclei and cytoplasm. Direct interaction of TIMAP with the eukaryotic elongation factor 1 A1 (eEF1A1) is shown by pull-down, LC–MS/MS, Far-Western and immunoprecipitations. In connection with the so called moonlighting functions of the elongation factor, eEF1A is thought to establish protein–protein interactions through a transcription-dependent nuclear export motif, TD-NEM, and to aid nuclear export of TD-NEM containing proteins. We found that a TD-NEM-like motif of TIMAP has a critical role in its specific binding to eEF1A1. However, eEF1A1 is not or not exclusively responsible for the nuclear export of TIMAP. On the contrary, TIMAP seems to regulate membrane localization of eEF1A1 as the elongation factor co-localized with TIMAP in the plasma membrane fraction of control endothelial cells, but it has disappeared from the membrane in TIMAP depleted cells. It is demonstrated that membrane localization of eEF1A1 depends on the phosphorylation state of its Thr residue(s); and ROCK phosphorylated eEF1A1 is a novel substrate for TIMAP-PP1 underlining the complex regulatory role of TIMAP in the endothelium. The elongation factor seems to be involved in the regulation of endothelial cell attachment and spreading as silencing of eEF1A1 positively affected these processes which were monitored by transendothelial resistance measurements.

Abstract: Cathode buffer layer (CBL) is one of the key issues influencing the performance of organic solar cells. In this article, a nanocomposite of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO) together with a conjugated polymer, poly[(9,9-bis(3'-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctyl)-fluorene] (PFN) was developed, and used as the CBL for solution processed inverted organic solar cells (OSC). In comparison with the bare ZnO, PFN or ZnO/PFN stacked layer, the ZnO:PFN nanocomposite CBL employing device showed superior device performance, in particular significantly improved fill factor. Optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC61BM device using ZnO:PFN composite CBLs reached to 3.56% and 7.17%, respectively. Influences of the mixing ratio and the layer thickness of the ZnO:PFN nanocomposite CBL on solar cell performance were carefully studied, and results indicated that ZnO:PFN CBL showed a wide tolerance of blend ratio and layer thickness. In particular, no obvious thickness dependent-device performance was found, even when the CBL layer thickness was higher than 125nm, providing a good printing processibility of the nanocomposite. Photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence, as well as electric conductivity of the ZnO:PFN films were studied, and the results were compared with that of the other three reference CBLs. Results demonstrated that the interaction between ZnO and PFN decreases the work function of the blended film, leading to a more favorable energy level alignment for electron injection at the interface. Analysis on the dark J–V curves of the solar cells revealed that device using ZnO:PFN CBL had the best diode characteristics including lowest reverse saturated current density (J0), ideal factor (n), and series resistance (Rs), and highest shunt resistance (Rsh). Such an improvement was ascribed to the defect passivation by the conjugated polymer, which led to an improved charge carrier selectivity of the CBL and consequently enhanced the FF of the solar cells. In addition, long-term stability of organic solar cells was also improved by using ZnO:PFN nanocomposite as the CBL. The current work provides a valuable guideline for the development of high performance cathode buffer layer material for printable organic solar cells.

Abstract: The present work describes a method for the development of hole-transport material (HTM) free, solution processable perovskite solar cell under ambient air conditions. This study mainly focuses on the working mechanism of the perovskite solar cell using impedance spectroscopy and current–voltage (I–V) techniques. Impedance spectroscopy reveals various interfacial processes in terms of resistive and capacitive elements, which provided an insight into the charge transport through the junction and bulk of the FTO–perovskite solar cell. The study also provides a new architecture of pervoskite solar cell, where in conducting polymer (poly-aniline) as a hole-extraction electrode increases the efficiency by 21% relative to FTO electrode. This article systematically explains the bridging and trapping effects within the perovskite solar cells for the first time.

Abstract: Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) on flexible substrates are ideal for making low-cost PV products available for a wide range of low power applications. In addition to lower material costs, a flexible solar cell also offers economies of scale through high volume roll-to-roll manufacturing. A disadvantage of using flexible polymer substrates, stems from their poor stability and degradation of both electrical and optical qualities when subjected to thermal processing steps required to make high efficiency TiO2 photoelectrodes. This study evaluates the potential of indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated flexible glass, known as Corning® Willow® Glass, as an alternative to polymer substrates for fabricating flexible DSSCs. The strain point and bend radius of this glass allows it to withstand high sintering temperatures and also makes it potentially suitable for roll-to-roll manufacturing. DSSCs fabricated using a 10µm TiO2 mesoporous layer and sensitized with N719 dye demonstrate that flexible glass DSSCs show a power conversion efficiency of 4.53% compared to the 3.09% efficiency value obtained for DSSCs fabricated using commercially available ITO coated thick glass. The enhanced performance of the Willow Glass DSSC is reflected in the improved fill factors (FF). As expected, cells fabricated with similar procedures using fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates yielded a higher power conversion efficiency of 7.42% since its sheet resistance remains substantially lower even after the heat treatment unlike ITO. With FTO, instead of ITO, flexible glass DSSCs could potentially achieve higher efficiencies comparable to standard thicker glass DSSCs. This is expected when suppliers are able to produce FTO coated willow glass with reproducible electrical conductivity. This study demonstrates for the first time that DSSCs can be fabricated using light weight, flexible glass substrates with comparable efficiencies to the standard thicker glass based DSSCs.

Abstract: Developments of metal oxide nanostructures for simultaneous improvements in light harvesting and charge collection can lead to a significant technical progress in various applications such as photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical cells and various types of solar cells. Here we present an array of three-dimensional titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanohelixes infiltrated with TiO2 nanoparticles as a multifunctional photoanode for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The unique geometry and the near-single crystallinity of the vertically aligned TiO2 nanohelix array results simultaneously in strong light scattering and enhanced carrier transport and collection, while maintaining a comparable surface area accessible for dye molecules by the infiltrated TiO2 nanoparticles. Consequently, despite a ~40% reduction in dye loading, the overall photon conversion efficiency of the DSSC with the nanoparticle-infiltrated nanohelix-array photoanode is enhanced by 6.2% in comparison with the DSSC with the conventional nanoparticle photoanode.

Abstract: During bioethanol fermentation process, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell membrane might provide main protection to tolerate accumulated ethanol, and S. cerevisiae cells might also remodel their membrane compositions or structure to try to adapt to or tolerate the ethanol stress. However, the exact changes and roles of S. cerevisiae cell membrane components during bioethanol fermentation still remains poorly understood. This study was performed to clarify changes and roles of S. cerevisiae cell membrane components during bioethanol fermentation. Both cell diameter and membrane integrity decreased as fermentation time lasting. Moreover, compared with cells at lag phase, cells at exponential and stationary phases had higher contents of ergosterol and oleic acid (C18:1) but lower levels of hexadecanoic (C16:0) and palmitelaidic (C16:1) acids. Contents of most detected phospholipids presented an increase tendency during fermentation process. Increased contents of oleic acid and phospholipids containing unsaturated fatty acids might indicate enhanced cell membrane fluidity. Compared with cells at lag phase, cells at exponential and stationary phases had higher expressions of ACC1 and HFA1. However, OLE1 expression underwent an evident increase at exponential phase but a decrease at following stationary phase. These results indicated that during bioethanol fermentation process, yeast cells remodeled membrane and more changeable cell membrane contributed to acquiring higher ethanol tolerance of S. cerevisiae cells. These results highlighted our knowledge about relationship between the variation of cell membrane structure and compositions and ethanol tolerance, and would contribute to a better understanding of bioethanol fermentation process and construction of industrial ethanologenic strains with higher ethanol tolerance.

Abstract: Active layer thickness-dependent internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) of photocurrent within bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices were characterized. These active layers consisted of an electron-donating narrow band-gap polymer and an electron-accepting fullerene derivative. In order to calculate IQE spectra as a function of active layer thickness, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and internal absorptance spectra of active layers with various thicknesses were estimated in these solar cell devices. The transfer matrix method (TMM) was used to calculate the internal absorptance spectra of active layers by using experimental optical constants of thin layers typical for these types of OPV devices including narrow band-gap polymer blend film. In addition, spatially resolved absorptance spectra were used to analyze obtained IPCE spectra as well as OPV device parameters (e.g., short circuit current density) at various active layer thicknesses. Finally, charge-carrier-collecting probability as a function of active layer thickness was suggested with which the relationship between initial exciton generation and final power conversion efficiency can be more quantitatively described.

Abstract: Conversion of sunlight by photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) combines a photonic process similar to photovoltaic cells, and a thermal process similar to conventional thermionic converters. As a result, the upper limit on the conversion efficiency of PETE devices is not the same as the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit that corresponds to the bandgap of the absorbing material, nor to the Carnot efficiency corresponding to its temperature. Here we analyze the upper limit on efficiency of ideal PETE devices in several possible configurations, in comparison to ideal photovoltaic cells and ideal solar thermal converters. Isothermal PETE converters are shown to be restricted to less than the SQ limit, but non-isothermal devices can exceed this limit. The limit of efficiency increases with the flux concentration reaching for example 52% at concentration of 1000 suns. Spectral splitting leads to a modest increase in conversion efficiency to 56% at 1000 suns. Addition of a secondary thermal cycle increases the efficiency limit for all PETE configurations, up to 69.8% and 70.4% for the cases of isothermal PETE and a dual bandgap PETE system at 1000 suns.

Abstract: In this study, shape-stabilized fatty acid eutectics and diatomite composites were prepared by absorbing liquid fatty acid eutectics into diatomite. The thermal properties of the composites were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In the composites, the eutectic mixtures acted as phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage, and the diatomite was used as supporting material. Expanded graphite (EG) was added to help prevent the eutectic mixtures from leakage and enhance thermal conductivity of the composite phase change materials (CPCMs). Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT-IR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electronic microscope (SEM) were used to survey the chemical structure, crystalloid phase and microstructure of the eutectic mixture/diatomite composites. The DSC results showed that the satisfactory sample melts at 26.69°C with a latent heat of 98.26kJkg−1 and solidifies at 21.85°C with a latent heat of 90.03kJkg−1 when the mass ratio of the eutectic mixture to the diatomite is 2:1 with 5% EG. According to the results of the Thermal Conductivity Meter (TCM), the EG could enhance the thermal conductivity of the composites. The thermal reliability of the composites was investigated by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The results indicated that the satisfactory CPCMs have good thermal stability, which can be used as shape-stabilized phase change materials for thermal energy storage.

Abstract: In this work, we hypothesized and demonstrated a new strategy to tune/modulate the electrochemical, microstructural and opto-electronic properties based on the manipulation of the intentionally included external dopant ion (X−) within the sulfonated polyaniline (SPANs). Through our new strategy, we developed a different type of SPANs comprising of internal (fixed) and external (mobile) dopant. The X− included SPANs were prepared through a sequential doping, dedoping and redoping processes and designated as SPAN-R (X−) (where X− is the anion of toluene sulfonic acid (TSA) or camphor sulfonic acid (CSA) or napthalene sulfonic acid (NSA)) by modifying the structure of 4-aminodiphenylamine-2-sulfonic acid with additional polyaniline chains to accommodate X−. SPAN-R(X−) polymers were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, UV–visible spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Atomic force microscopy to elucidate the influence of X− on the electrical, optoelectronic, microstructural properties and surface properties on the performance characteristics of polymer solar cells (PSCs) fabricated with SPAN-R(X−) as a buffer layer. The electrochemical band gap, degree of doping (DD), electrical conductivity and degree of crystallinity (CD) were evaluated and correlated to understand the influence of X− on them. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs featuring SPAN-R(TSA−) as a buffer layer showed a ~3.2 times improvement in the overall PCE, compared with the PSCs having pristine SPAN (not containing X−) as a buffer layer and is higher than that of SPAN-R(CSA−) and SPAN-R(NSA−) based devices. The superior photovoltaic (PV) characteristics observed for SPAN-R(TSA−) is due to the synergistic contributions from appropriate energy-level/work function alignment, higher conductivity, higher DD and induced molecular order with the photoactive layer. Importantly, PSCs with SPAN-R(X−) buffer layer processed at low temperature (30°C) (without thermal treatment) exhibited improved PV characteristics and better air-stability as compared to the device having poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) (thermally annealed at 150°C) as buffer layer. As buffer layers, SPAN-R(X−) polymers, containing fixed and mobile dopants, are most attractive because of low temperature processability and improved solar cell performance.

Abstract: This work aims to develop new composite materials presenting a high energy density accompanied with an optimal sorption capacity for seasonal heat storage. Silica–alumina was selected as host material and various quantities of calcium chloride, barium hydroxide and lithium nitrate were deposited on it by incipient wetness impregnation. The obtained composites were fully characterized in their structural, textural, and surface properties, and the water sorption/desorption heats were determined by TG–DSC analysis for all composites, salts, and support. A detailed analysis of the dehydration steps is reported for the three salts. The heat released and the quantity of adsorbed water were found to depend on various parameters such as the amount of accessible salt, the dispersion of the salt on the surface and/or into the porous matrix, and the hydration level of the deposited salt hydrates. The TG–DSC results revealed that the heat released per gram of material increases with the amount of calcium chloride and lithium nitrate, while it remains nearly constant with the barium hydroxide loading. Due to its high heat of water sorption and low cost, the composite containing 15wt% of calcium chloride (738kJkg−1sample) appears to be the most promising compared to lithium nitrate or barium hydroxide composites (609 and 408kJkg−1sample, respectively). CaCl2/silica–alumina composites reveal to be potential candidates to thermochemically store energy.

Abstract: Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is an oxidative stress-sensitive Ca2+-permeable channel. In monocytes/macrophages, H2O2-induced TRPM2 activation causes cell death and/or production of chemokines that aggravate inflammatory diseases. However, relatively high concentrations of H2O2 are required for activation of TRPM2 channels in vitro. Thus, in the present study, factors that sensitize TRPM2 channels to H2O2 were identified and subsequent physiological responses were examined in U937 human monocytes. Temperature increase from 30°C to 37°C enhanced H2O2-induced TRPM2-mediated increase in intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in TRPM2-expressing HEK 293 cells (TRPM2/HEK cells). The H2O2-induced TRPM2 activation enhanced by the higher temperature was dramatically sensitized by intracellular Fe2+-accumulation following pretreatment with FeSO4. Thus intracellular Fe2+-accumulation sensitizes H2O2-induced TRPM2 activation at around body temperature. Moreover, intracellular Fe2+-accumulation increased poly(ADP-ribose) levels in nuclei by H2O2 treatment, and the sensitization of H2O2-induced TRPM2 activation were almost completely blocked by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, suggesting that intracellular Fe2+-accumulation enhances H2O2-induced TRPM2 activation by increase of ADP-ribose production through poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase pathway. Similarly, pretreatment with FeSO4 stimulated H2O2-induced TRPM2 activation at 37°C in U937 cells and enhanced H2O2-induced ERK phosphorylation and interleukin-8 (CXCL8) production. Although the addition of H2O2 to cells under conditions of intracellular Fe2+-accumulation caused cell death, concentration of H2O2 required for CXCL8 production was lower than that resulting in cell death. These results indicate that intracellular Fe2+-accumulation sensitizes TRPM2 channels to H2O2 and subsequently produces CXCL8 at around body temperature. It is possible that sensitization of H2O2-induced TRPM2 channels by Fe2+ may implicated in hemorrhagic brain injury via aggravation of inflammation, since Fe2+ is released by heme degradation under intracerebral hemorrhage.

Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests that the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are caused by the intraneuronal accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (Aβ). Reuptake of extracellular Aβ is believed to contribute significantly to the intraneuronal Aβ pool in the early stages of AD. Published reports have claimed that the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) mediates Aβ1–42 uptake and lysosomal trafficking in GT1–7 neuronal cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast non-neuronal cells. However, there is no direct evidence supporting the role of LRP1 in Aβ internalization in primary neurons. Our recent study indicated that p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling pathways are involved in regulating α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR)-mediated Aβ1–42 uptake in SH-SY5Y cells. This study was designed to explore the regulation of MAPK signaling pathways on LRP1-mediated Aβ internalization in neurons. We found that extracellular Aβ1–42 oligomers could be internalized into endosomes/lysosomes and mitochondria in cortical neurons. Aβ1–42 and LRP1 were also found co-localized in neurons during Aβ1–42 internalization, and they could form Aβ1–42–LRP1 complex. Knockdown of LRP1 expression significantly decreased neuronal Aβ1–42 internalization. Finally, we identified that p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling pathways regulated the internalization of Aβ1–42 via LRP1. Therefore, these results demonstrated that LRP1, p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 mediated the internalization of Aβ1–42 in neurons and provided evidence that blockade of LRP1 or inhibitions of MAPK signaling pathways might be a potential approach to lowering brain Aβ levels and served a potential therapeutic target for AD.

Abstract: Ultrathin silicon provides a viable pathway towards the realization of photovoltaic devices aimed at reducing material usage, utilizing low quality material and diversifying their application. However, solar cells based on the ultrathin film reported thus far are still far from fully optimized compared with their crystalline, wafer-based counterparts due to insufficient light absorption. Furthermore, fabrication of these ultrathin devices on an inexpensive substrate, such as glass and plastic, is still a critical issue at present. Here we present an approach to fabricate ultrathin, high performance silicon solar cells with a tandem structure on a glass substrate. The strategy involves transferring the ultrathin film to the glass substrate by applying an anodic bonding process, introducing a nanoscale inverted pyramid light trapping structure that is suitable for conformal deposition to enhance light absorption, and engineering doped layers to avoid parasitic optical and electrical losses. We demonstrate a-Si/c-Si tandem solar cells with high efficiencies of up to 13.6%, using a 300nm thick a-Si top cell and a sub-8μm-thick silicon bottom cell. This significant improvement of the efficiency is achieved even without the complicated passivation process normally applied in high-efficiency silicon solar cells. Our results are an important step toward high-efficiency ultrathin solar cells for the future.

Abstract: We briefly review the basic concepts of junction capacitance and the peculiarities related to amorphous semiconductors, paying tribute to Cohen and to his pioneering work. We extend the discussion to very high efficiency silicon heterojunction (SiHET) solar cells where both an amorphous semiconductor, namely hydrogenated amorphous silicon, and heterojunctions are present. By presenting both modeling and experimental results, we demonstrate that the conventional theory of junction capacitance based on the depletion approximation in the space charge region, cannot reproduce the capacitance data obtained on SiHET cells. The experimental temperature dependence is significantly stronger than that of the depletion-layer capacitance, while the bias dependence yields underestimated values of the diffusion potential, leading to strong errors if applied to the determination of band offsets using the procedure proposed precedingly in the literature. We demonstrate that this is not related to the amorphous nature of a-Si:H, but to the existence of a strongly inverted c-Si surface layer that requires minority carriers to be taken into account in the analysis of the junction capacitance.

Abstract: Background and objectives
We undertook the present study to ascertain the contributing risk factors and explore the epidemiological and mycological characteristics of opportunistic candidemia among patients with hematological malignancies.
Design and settings
Observational cross-sectional study in a tertiary care center.
Patients and methods
Consecutive patients with hematological malignancies reporting to the collaborating medical and pediatric units with a febrile episode were recruited and screened for candidemia by blood culture. Recovered Candida isolates were speciated and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed as per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guideline (CLSI) guidelines M44-A. Further analysis was done for potential risk factors and compared between culture positive and negative patients.
Results
Of 150 patients recruited, the majority (n=27) were between 51 and 60years and the male to female ratio was 1.63:1. Fifteen patients (10%) were culture positive. The culture positivity was significantly higher in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) than in non-ALL patients (p=0.03). There was significant association of candidaemia with leucopenia, chemotherapeutic drugs, corticosteroids and presence of indwelling devices. Duration of disease (p=0.032) and duration of hospitalization (p=0.003) were significantly prolonged in culture positive patients. C. tropicalis was the commonest isolate (46.67%), with non- Candida albicans outnumbering C. albicans in all categories of hematological malignancies (2.75:1). All isolates of C. albicans were uniformly sensitive to all the azoles, but only 50% were sensitive to amphotericin B and none to nystatin and flucytosine.
Conclusions
This observational study identifies ALL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as the forms of hematological malignancy predominantly associated with candidemia; specifies risk factors and chemotherapeutic agents predisposing patients towards its occurrence; reports a preponderance of C. tropicalis among the causative agents and finds voriconazole to be the most effective antifungal agent against the recovered isolates. This information could assist in tailoring prophylactic and therapeutic antifungal practices for this infection, according to local epidemiological and mycological characteristics.

Abstract: The morphology, structure, optical and electrical properties of perovskite films treated by two different annealing methods with different annealing temperature ramp and their corresponding device performance have been studied and compared. Annealing temperature ramp significantly influences the surface morphology and optical properties of perovskite films which determines the performance of solar cells which determines the performance of solar cells. The perovskite films treated by one-step direct annealing method tend to exhibit irregular and weak ultraviolet–visible absorption spectrum, which can easily result in great variation in the final performance of solar cells. While multi-step slow annealing is beneficial for preparing highly uniform and well-crystallized perovskite films, and thus these devices present tightly-distributed performance parameters. The best device treated by multi-step slow annealing method showed a short circuit current density of 21.49mA/cm2, an open circuit voltage of 0.988V, a fill factor of 64.86%, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.58%, which is a 57% enhancement of the overall PCE relative to 8.65% of the device treated by one-step annealing method. These findings suggest that optimized slow temperature ramp is necessary to prepare high-efficient and well-reproducible perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: The absence of an effective texturing technique for diamond-wire sawn multi-crystalline silicon (DWS mc-Si) solar cells has hindered commercial upgrading from traditional multi-wire slurry sawn silicon (MWSS mc-Si) solar cells. In this paper, a nano-texture technique has been developed to achieve 18.31% efficient DWS mc-Si solar cells on a pilot production line. Their unique pyramidal nanostructure, which has the most close-packed {111} surface of Si diamond crystal, not only benefits both light-trapping and electric properties but also can effectively remove the saw-marks and amorphous layer of the cells. Therefore, the short-circuit current Isc of a nano-textured DWS mc-Si solar cell is ~324mA higher than that of a micron-textured one, while its open-circuit voltage Voc does not show an evident decrease with the increase of its surface area. The technique has paved the way for the mass production of DWS mc-Si solar cells by satisfying the exact requirements of the PV industry for high efficiency and low cost.

Abstract: The electrochromic, photodegradation, and photoinduced hydrophilicity properties of the WO3/TiO2 core–shell nanostructure as a smart building material for energy-saving are investigated. The core–shell nanostructure exhibits a highly reduced ion intercalation capacity with good reversible electrochemical cycling of intercalation–deintercalation, and shows a higher coloration efficiency (110.8cm2C−1), faster switching speed (0.7s and 2.9s) and better cycling performance than as-deposited WO3 nanowires (NWs). The TiO2 shell layer greatly enhanced the photocatalytic oxidation activity of WO3 NWs, increasing the photoinduced hydrophilic conversion. The enhanced photocatalytic reaction by the core–shell structure was attributed to the multi-electron reduction in the interlayer, caused by the electrons injected from the conduction band of the WO3 NWs. These results suggest that the WO3/TiO2 core–shell nanostructure enhances the electrochromic, photodegradation, and photoinduced hydrophilicity properties due to the increased density of charge separated electron–hole pairs aided by the TiO2 and WO3 interlayer. The WO3/TiO2 core–shell structure was found to possess superior properties giving it good potential for use in energy-saving smart windows.

Abstract: Semiconductor films play a crucial role when it comes to modern solar-based technologies to generate electricity, produce solar fuels, or convert the environmental pollutants to other harmless materials. In this paper, using an interesting simple as well as versatile electrochemical route, a nanocomposite Cu/Zn/Sn oxide semiconductor film was fabricated on a fluorine doped tin oxide glass and investigated as a photocathode of quantum dot solar cells in a sulfide/polysulfide electrolyte solution. X-ray diffraction analyses revealed a composite nature for this electrodeposited film. A broadband light absorption was witnessed and the band gap (1.63eV) was determined through Tauc׳s procedure. Scanning electron micrographs exhibited a non-smooth morphology for this composite film, which provides a greater area for heterogeneous reactions occurring upon the electrode surface. Mott–Schottky and potentiodynamic polarization plots indicated that the fabricated electrode acts as a complex p-type photocathode. The electrochemical impedance studies proved that under light irradiation, by photo-generation of charge carriers (electron-hole), the interfacial charge transfer resistance decreases and the cathodic current becomes consequently enhanced. After coating (photodeposition) with silver, a complicated photoelectrochemical response was finally observed and the findings were explained in detail.

Abstract: To improve the transmittance of Mg–Y based switchable mirrors in the transparent state the surface was coated with a TiO2 thin film using e-beam evaporation and the optical properties were studied. The TiO2 films had a refractive index of ~2.1. As a result of the TiO2 coating with a thickness of ~65nm, the transmittance in the visible range was considerably improved and consequently the visible transmittance in the transparent state reached 68%. This result was consistent with simulation results calculated using complex refractive indices for hydrides of Pd, Mg–Y alloy, and Ta. Thus, it is concluded that TiO2 is one of the best candidates for an antireflection layer to improve the optical properties of switchable mirrors.

Abstract: Here we present for the first time a TiO2/Cu2O all-oxide heterojunction solar cell entirely produced by spray pyrolysis onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) covered glass substrates, using silver as a back contact. A combinatorial approach was chosen to investigate the impact of the TiO2 window layer and the Cu2O light absorber thicknesses. We observe an open circuit voltage up to 350mV and a short circuit current density which is strongly dependent of the Cu2O thickness, reaching a maximum of ~0.4mA/cm2. Optical investigation reveals that a thickness of 300nm spray pyrolysis deposited Cu2O is sufficient to absorb most photons with an energy above the symmetry allowed optical transition of 2.5eV, indicating that the low current densities are caused by strong recombination in the absorber that consists of small Cu2O grains.

Abstract: Light beam induced current (LBIC) measurements of ITO-free organic photovoltaic modules with monolithic series connection are presented. Selective bias illumination is used to extract the light beam generated current from the module. A large variation of the photocurrent is observed among the cells which is unlikely to match the real generated photocurrent. In order to investigate this behavior, a novel approach (filtering approach) is presented in which the photocurrent of the measured cell is reduced while the remaining cells are kept under full illumination. This method enables the detection of the correct photocurrent of each cell and thus to identify the cell which limits the module current if all the cells comprise large parallel resistances. Dark lock-in thermography measurements of the module revealed several shunted cells. In this case the filtering approach overestimates the photocurrent. Numerical simulations of LBIC applied to modules using either selective bias illumination or forward bias voltage were carried out to understand the observed behavior in detail. The results reveal that a reliable detection of the photocurrent is impossible when several cells have rather low parallel resistances. Whereas for selective bias illumination the photocurrent response of the measured cell is an unambiguous function of the cell׳s parallel resistance this is not the case for an applied forward bias voltage.

Abstract: The effect of intense pulsed light (IPL) annealing on the fabrication of OPV buffer layers was investigated. In order to avoid causing damage with the high intensity light, an inverted OPV structure was used. Sol–gel type ZnO was annealed by IPL and used as an electron extraction layer. The effects of controlling a variety of parameters, including the voltage, pulse duration, and distance between the substrate and the light source, on the device fabrication process were studied. In order to obtain better energy level matching between the work function of the cathode and the LUMO of the semiconducting acceptor, polyethylenimine ethoxylated was used. The most homogenous ZnO nanoparticle layer was obtained with 30 IPL pulse treatments, resulting in an optimum electron extraction layer. IPL annealed ZnO devices showed enhanced performance compared to thermally annealed ZnO devices. OPV devices with IPL-treated ZnO coated with PEIE showed a ~10% enhancement in the conversion efficiency compared to devices with thermally annealed ZnO coated with PEIE.

Abstract: Apelin is an adipokine that has a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, which may offer potential for therapy. Because migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a key event in the development of atherosclerosis, understanding its effect on the atherosclerotic vasculature is needed. Here we investigated the effect of apelin on VSMC migration and the possible signaling mechanism. In cultured rat VSMCs, apelin dose- and time-dependently promoted VSMC migration. Apelin increased the phosphorylation of Akt, whereas LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and an Akt1/2 kinase inhibitor blocked the apelin-induced VSMC migration. Apelin dose-dependently induced phosphorylation of Forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) and promoted its translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm, which were blocked by LY294002 and Akt1/2 kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, apelin increased matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) expression and gelatinolytic activity. Overexpression of a constitutively active, phosphorylation-resistant mutant, TM-FoxO3a, in VSMCs abrogated the effect of apelin on MMP-2 expression and VSMC migration. ARP101, an inhibitor of MMP-2, suppressed apelin-induced VSMC migration. Moreover, the levels of apelin, phosphorylated Akt, FoxO3a, and MMP-2 were higher in human carotid-artery atherosclerotic plaque than in adjacent normal vessels. We demonstrate that PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a signaling may be involved in apelin inducing VSMC migration. Phosphorylation of FoxO3a plays a central role in mediating the apelin-induced MMP-2 activation and VSMC migration.

Abstract: We report angle resolved characterization of nanostructured and conventionally textured silicon solar cells. The nanostructured solar cells are realized through a single step, mask-less, scalable reactive ion etching (RIE) texturing of the surface. Photovoltaic properties including short circuit current, open circuit voltage, fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency are each measured as function of the relative incident angle between the solar cell and the light source. The relative incident angle is varied from 0° to 90° in steps of 10° in orthogonal axes, such that each solar cell is characterized at 100 different angle combinations. The angle resolved photovoltaic properties are summarized in terms of the average, angle-dependent electrical power output normalized to the power output at normal incidence and differently textured cells on different silicon substrates are compared in terms of angle resolved performance. The results show a 3% point improvement in average electrical power output normalized with respect to normal incidence power output of RIE textured, multicrystalline Si cells compared to conventional multicrystalline Si cells and above 1% point improvement of RIE textured monocrystalline Si cells compared to conventional monocrystalline Si cells.

Abstract: We report introduction of pn-junction nanorods in a polymer matrix to form hybrid bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. This is a paradigm shift from conventional hybrid solar cells, where quantum dots or nanorods of an inorganic semiconductor and a conjugated polymer form a BHJ. The pn-junctions were formed in n-type CdS nanorods through a controlled cationic exchange process; here p-type Cu2S formed from one end of CdS due to selective reactivity of crystalline planes of the nanorods. Due to an epitaxial attachment between Cu2S and CdS semiconductors in the nanorod, a depletion region hence formed in the pn-junction, which is a classical example of type-II band-alignment at the interface. The junction separated charge carriers under illumination through a drift of minority carriers across the depletion region. Hybrid BHJs based on Cu2S|CdS pn-junction nanorods in a conventional polymer matrix therefore acted as efficient solar cells as compared to similar BHJ devices with nanorods of individual materials, that is Cu2S or CdS. We varied the relative lengths of p- and n-sections of the pn-junctions that in turn controlled charge separation and carrier transport processes to optimize the solar cell performance.

Abstract: A soft chemical route has been employed to synthesize ZnO@CuInS2 (ZnO@CIS) core–shell hexagonal nanopyramids using 2-mercaptopropionic acid as a surface-functionalized agent. The core–shell formation was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations. UV–visible absorption spectrum of the core–shell nanopyramids shows a red shift of the band edge of pure ZnO in the visible region along with broadening of the absorption spectrum. ZnO@CIS nanopyramids can be used as an antireflection coating on Silicon solar cell, exhibit lower reflectance and better light trapping ability than the Silicon solar cell with ZnO nanopyramids. Moreover higher photocurrent is obtained for the n-ZnO/n-CIS core–shell junction due to favorable band bending. The efficiency of the p-Si/n-ZnO solar cell (6.6%) is improved to 10% for p-Si/n-ZnO@n-CIS configuration.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new, updated version of the commonly used semiconductor device simulator PC1D named PC1Dmod 6.1. The new program is based on the previously published command line version cmd-PC1D 6.0, which has implemented several new options related to the device physics, but now uses an updated version of the original PC1D graphical user interface. The program thus provides the possibility for using Fermi–Dirac statistics and a selection of state-of-the-art models for crystalline silicon, including injection-dependent band gap narrowing, carrier mobility and Auger recombination, in a familiar setting. Version 6.1 also has implemented the recently published band gap narrowing model by Yan and Cuevas, which is based on empirical studies of a large selection of both n+ and p+ emitters, in addition to Schenk's model. It has also implemented the mobility model for compensated material by Schindler et al. Finally, the maximum number of nodes, time steps and wavelengths have been increased in order to reduce unnecessary constraints on simulations and external files. The results from the PC1Dmod 6.1 simulations have been compared with those of other simulation tools and with previously published data to verify the correct implementation of the new models. Emitter saturation currents calculated using PC1Dmod 6.1 showed an excellent agreement with those obtained using the emitter recombination calculator EDNA 2, and the new program was able to successfully reproduce previously published experimental data and previous implementations of the models. Both PC1Dmod 6.1 and the command line version cmd-PC1D 6.1 are open source software, and are freely available for download.

Abstract: The investigation is aimed at elaboration of technology for submicron p+-GaAs layer formation on micro/nanotextured n-GaAs substrates by using low-temperature (550°C) diffusion of zinc to take the advantage of optical and recombination properties of textured interface for solar cells. Process duration, surface microrelief morphology (dendrite or quasi-grating (grating-like)) and the substrate doping impurity concentration were varied. Optical, photoelectric and electrical properties of p+–n junction were studied to optimize the process conditions. The highest efficiency was obtained in structures with a quasi-grating surface microrelief, substrate doping close to Nd≃1017cm−3 and process duration about 45min.

Abstract: In organic photovoltaic (OPV), the photoactive layer is the main part, where the energy conversion process takes place. In our work we focus on Si-PCPDTBT:PC70BM (1:2) photoactive blend layers, where Si-PCPDTBT and PC70BM are the poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2,3-d]silole)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3 benzothiadiazole)] and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester, respectively. The mixture of these materials was deposited on the ITO/glass substrate and investigated using different analytical methods such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after the degradation. The different degree degradation of layers measured as % of UV absorbance loss was performed under the illumination at ambient air using a solar simulator (AM 1.5, Xenon arc lamp). SIMS depth profiles reveal a diffusion of atmospheric oxygen through the photoactive layer leading to the photooxidation of organic materials as unveiled from the distribution of selected ions fragments (SO−, NO−, SO2−, NO2− and CO−). AFM and SEM images of the non-degraded sample show a relatively smooth surface. SEM investigations of the degraded layers reveal a homogenous formation of dispersed fibril-like nano-objects at the surface. The formation of such nano-objects may explain the increase of the layer surface oxidation and volatilization during the long-term degradation.

Abstract: In2S3 thin layers can be prepared by Spray-ILGAR® (Ion Layer Gas Reaction) from indium trichloride or from indium triacetylacetonate solutions. In the first case, the film contains a controllable amount of Cl. The concentration of H2O or Cl was varied systematically in the precursor solutions that were used for the deposition of In2S3 buffer layers on commercially available Cu(Ga,In)(S,Se)2 absorbers. The layers were characterized by ultraviolet photo electron spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, modulated surface photovoltage spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, combined with a sequential etching procedure. The latter allowed to estimate an element-specific depth profile. Experimental findings were correlated with the performance of the corresponding solar cells. The presence of H2O or Cl in the precursor solutions has a strong influence on the diffusion of Cu+ and Na+ cations from the absorber into the buffer layer. The open circuit voltage of solar cells with In2S3 buffer layers prepared from Cl-free, H2O-containing precursor solutions was higher by up to 100mV than those from Cl-containing, but H2O-free solutions. For this reason, the average solar energy conversion efficiency of cells of the first buffer type was higher (14.7%) than for solar cells of the second type (12.1%).

Abstract: Herein, we present a versatile way to increase the photopic contrast of electrochromic devices (ECDs), approximately 14%, through the use of binary mixtures of propylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate, and ethylene carbonate that serve the role as plasticizers in the gel electrolyte. The binary plasticizer mixture changed the physical properties of the gel electrolyte medium, including the viscosity and dielectric constant, and also facilitates the diffusion of ions and monomer in the medium leading to an increase in ionic conductivity and the photopic contrast. ECDs were fabricated using a one-step lamination procedure, based on poly(2,2-dimethyl-3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT-Me2) with different polymer gel electrolyte compositions where the electrochromic polymer was electrochemically obtained in situ. Gel electrolytes based on unary or binary plasticizer systems and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) with varying lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTrif) loading were investigated for the effect of solvent on ionic conductivity and the resulting photopic contrast of the ECD. This study demonstrates a relationship between photopic contrast and ionic conductivity, where the system reaches a maximum in photopic contrast the system is also at the maximum ionic conductivity.

Abstract: The amino acid taurine is essential for the function of skeletal muscle and administration is proposed as a treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Taurine homeostasis is dependent on multiple processes including absorption of taurine from food, endogenous synthesis from cysteine and reabsorption in the kidney. This study investigates the cause of reported taurine deficiency in the dystrophic mdx mouse model of DMD. Levels of metabolites (taurine, cysteine, cysteine sulfinate and hypotaurine) and proteins (taurine transporter [TauT], cysteine deoxygenase and cysteine sulfinate dehydrogenase) were quantified in juvenile control C57 and dystrophic mdx mice aged 18 days, 4 and 6 weeks. In C57 mice, taurine content was much higher in both liver and plasma at 18 days, and both cysteine and cysteine deoxygenase were increased. As taurine levels decreased in maturing C57 mice, there was increased transport (reabsorption) of taurine in the kidney and muscle. In mdx mice, taurine and cysteine levels were much lower in liver and plasma at 18 days, and in muscle cysteine was low at 18 days, whereas taurine was lower at 4: these changes were associated with perturbations in taurine transport in liver, kidney and muscle and altered metabolism in liver and kidney. These data suggest that the maintenance of adequate body taurine relies on sufficient dietary intake of taurine and cysteine availability and metabolism, as well as retention of taurine by the kidney. This research indicates dystrophin deficiency not only perturbs taurine metabolism in the muscle but also affects taurine metabolism in the liver and kidney, and supports targeting cysteine and taurine deficiency as a potential therapy for DMD.

Abstract: We report PIN-type narrow-gap (Eg<1.5eV) a-SiGe:H single-junction solar cells containing integrated n-type hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon oxide (μc-SiOx:H) layers that exhibit exceptionally high FFs in this paper. In addition to effectively enhancing the long-wavelength response of the a-SiGe:H single-junction solar cells, the integration of an n-type μc-SiOx:H layer with a small oxygen content to fine-tune the leakage current characteristics can enormously improve the FFs. This opens a new way to improve narrow-gap a-SiGe:H solar cells, in addition to traditional optimization strategies such as material quality optimization and band gap profiling. The highest FF of 70.62% achieved with the proposed approach was for PIN-type a-SiGe:H single-junction solar cells with an average band gap of 1.48eV. The omnipotent properties of μc-SiOx:H layers, including optical enhancement of the long-wavelength response, independent control of longitudinal and lateral conductivity, effective elimination of the leakage current, and so on, make them likely to be extended to other types of solar cells such as microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) or polycrystalline chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) cells, opening up new opportunities for acquiring solar cells with higher performance.

Alpha-synuclein overexpression negatively regulates insulin receptor substrate 1 by activating mTORC1/S6K1 signaling,

Abstract: Alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies, a pathological feature of Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as synucleinopathies. Among the possible mechanisms of α-Syn-mediated neurotoxicity is interference with cytoprotective pathways such as insulin signaling. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 is a docking protein linking IRs to downstream signaling pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K)1; the latter exerts negative feedback control on insulin signaling, which is impaired in Alzheimer's disease. Our previous study found that α-Syn overexpression can inhibit protein phosphatase (PP)2A activity, which is involved in the protective mechanism of insulin signaling. In this study, we found an increase in IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser636 and decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation, which accelerated IRS-1 turnover and reduced insulin-Akt signaling in α-Syn-overexpressing SK-N-SH cells and transgenic mice. The mTOR complex (C)1/S6K1 blocker rapamycin inhibited the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser636 in cells overexpressing α-Syn, suggesting that mTORC1/S6K1 activation by α-Syn causes feedback inhibition of insulin signaling via suppression of IRS-1 function. α-Syn overexpression also inhibited PP2A activity, while the PP2A agonist C2 ceramide suppressed both S6K1 activation and IRS-1 Ser636 phosphorylation upon α-Syn overexpression. Thus, α-Syn overexpression negatively regulated IRS-1 via mTORC1/S6K1 signaling while activation of PP2A reverses this process. These results provide evidence for a link between α-Syn and IRS-1 that may represent a novel mechanism for α-Syn-associated pathogenesis.

Abstract: High reflective mirrors are commonly used in solar concentration devices. It has been shown that photonic mirrors are suitable for this purpose. However, despite their high reflectivity, they absorb radiation and heat up showing degradation. To overcome this problem here we propose to enhance the reflectivity of the mirrors. We report an improved and easy method to design broadband high reflective mirrors and build them from porous silicon multilayers. Those are composed of a continuous arrangement of submirrors reflecting each one at a given wavelength. This method consists in staggering the wavelength distribution following a relation based on the Padé approximant. We simulate the reflectance spectra using the transfer matrix method taking into account the experimental complex refractive index of porous silicon. The comparison between the experimental and the reflectance spectra shows a good agreement. With this technique we have fabricated high quality dielectric mirrors that can be used for concentrated solar energy applications among others.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSn(S1−ySey)4 (CZTSSe, 0≤y≤1) based solar cells relying on earth abundant and low toxic elements are attracting a lot of research interest for photovoltaic applications. Currently, the record efficiency (12.6%) is still far away from the required value (15–18%) for future commercialization. One of the main issues concerning the performance limitation of the devices is certainly the formation of secondary phases, coupled with the off-stoichiometric growth conditions used for high efficiency solar cells. In this work, we prepared Cu-poor and Zn-rich CZTSSe absorbers and solar cells in the whole S–Se compositional range, with the aim of analyzing the formation of secondary phases and their impact on the optoelectronic properties of the devices. The results show that much less secondary phases (especially Zn(S,Se)) are prone to be present on the surface and at the back region of Se-rich CZTSSe absorbers, when compared with other types of kesterites like Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu2ZnSnSe4 and S-rich CZTSSe. CZTSSe solid solutions almost free of secondary phases on the surface and at the back region can be obtained by the appropriate control of different process parameters: thermal treatment (low Ar pressure), composition (simultaneous sulfo-selenization) and surface etching (using (NH4)2S solutions). Based on this absorber with very low secondary phases content, best efficiency of 6.8% for a Se-rich CZTSSe solar cell was achieved using a single-step sulfo-selenization process.

Abstract: Polycrystalline CuIn1−xAlxSe2 (CIASe) thin films have been prepared on bare and Mo-coated substrates by selenization of evaporated Cu–In–Al precursors layers with 0≤x≤0.3 and thicknesses below 1.4µm. X-ray diffraction measurements show several peaks around the (112) reflection corresponding to CIASe phases with different Al contents. This has been attributed to the existence of a depth compositional gradient in the layers with higher Al contents due to a diffusion of Al towards the back contact region. Raman scattering measurements directly performed with the excitation laser spot on both the front and back surfaces from absorbers that were previously mechanically removed from the Mo coated substrates confirm the existence of complex CIASe absorbers with graded Al content, which leads to a corresponding grading of the absorber bandgap. Enrichment of Al content at the back contact region is also accompanied by a decrease of the grain size as shown by cross-sectional Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The best CIASe based solar cells have Jsc, Voc, FF and efficiencies of 29.3mA/cm2, 430mV, 51.1% and 6.5%, respectively, for an overall Al/(In+Al) relative content x~0.2. Comparison of these values with those from equivalent devices made without Al show a significant increase of the device efficiency. These data confirm the existence of a significant improvement of the device performance because of the increased absorber bandgap in the CIASe quaternary alloys.

Abstract: A high contrast, self-standing, and thermoplastic solid polymer electrolyte (PE) with electrochromic property is fabricated by utilizing N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), heptyl viologen (HV(BF4)2), succinonitrile (SN), and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP). Various amounts of the ionic liquid (IL, BMIMBF4) are added into the PE, and the amount of IL is found to play an important role in affecting the ionic conductivity, morphology, and thus electrochemical property of the obtained PE. The IL content in the PE is optimized in order to achieve a better electrochemical and electrochromic properties of the obtained electrochromic device (ECD). The effect of the IL content in PE on the electrochemical and electrochromic properties of the ECD is discussed in terms of the ionic conductivity and morphology of the PE. The optimized ECD, which uses the PE containing 5wt% IL, exhibits a reversible transmittance change of 60.1% at 615nm during the switching between 0 and 0.9V with a promising long-term stability; both the transmittance change and the long-term stability of the ECD using the PE containing 5wt% IL are much better than that using the PE without IL.

Abstract: A layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of poly(butyl viologen) (PBV) and poly(peroxotungstate) was used for preparing a cathodically coloring dual electrochrome WO3–PBV film. A new formulation containing ferrocenecarboxaldehyde and potassium hexacyanoruthenate(II) was employed for the first time and anodically coloring ruthenium purple (RP) thin films were electrodeposited. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared analyses confirmed the RP film structure to be an inorganic coordination polymer: Kx’FexIII[RuII(CN)6]y, wherein Fe3+ and Ru2+ color centers are flanked by CN− ligands. Nanoscale electrical conductivities determined by conducting atomic force microscopy were deduced to be 1.03 and 147.4mScm−1, for the RP and WO3–PBV LbL films respectively, which confirmed their ability to function as mixed conductors, attributes pertinent during optical switching. Reversible bias induced transition between purple and colorless hues was attained in the RP film and between deep blue and colorless states was achieved for the WO3–PBV LbL film with coloration efficiencies of 188 and 380cm2C−1 respectively. A complementarily coloring electrochromic device of WO3–PBV/RP was fabricated with an environmentally benign, inexpensive aqueous electrolyte, which switched between blue, purple, and colorless states. The device exhibited an electrochromic efficiency of 476cm2C−1 at 580nm, an outstanding transmission modulation of 49%, and short switching times (~1s); all under remarkably low operating voltages of ±1V. The WO3–PBV/RP device can deliver high optical contrast under low operating bias, and is highly scalable and durable, which demonstrates it to be ideal for practical optical switching devices like fast changing displays or smart windows.

Abstract: This paper presents the experimental demonstration of silicon solar cells that incorporate an enhanced MIS passivated contact scheme on a phosphorus diffused surface. By depositing intrinsic a-Si:H on an ultrathin SiOx layer and alloying with an overlying aluminium layer, the interface passivation has been vastly improved over that of conventional MIS contacts, whilst maintaining a low contact resistance. This paper focuses on the optimisation of the Al/a-Si:H alloying process and the influence of the tunnelling SiOx layer thickness. A conversion efficiency of 21.0% has been achieved for n-type cells fabricated with a front boron diffusion and a full area rear MIS passivated phosphorus diffusion. The cells exhibit a moderate Voc=666mV and FF=0.805, whereas Jsc 39.3mA/cm2 is relatively low due to a non-optimal antireflection coating and back surface reflector, and hence will be subject to further improvement.

Abstract: Cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II (cN-II) has been reported to be involved in cell survival, nucleotide metabolism and in the cellular response to anticancer drugs. With the aim to further evaluate the role of this enzyme in cell biology, we stably modulated its expression the human glioblastoma cell ADF in which the transient inhibition of cN-II has been shown to induce cell death. Stable cell lines were obtained both with inhibition, obtained with plasmids coding cN-II-targeting short hairpin RNA, and stimulation, obtained with plasmids coding Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP)-fused wild type cN-II or a GFP-fused hyperactive mutant (GFP-cN-II-R367Q), of cN-II expression. Silenced cells displayed a decreased proliferation rate while the over expressing cell lines displayed an increased proliferation rate as evidenced by impedance measurement using the xCELLigence device. The expression of nucleotide metabolism relevant genes was only slightly different between cell lines, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in transfected cells. Cells with decreased cN-II expression were resistant to the nucleoside analog fludarabine confirming the involvement of cN-II in the metabolism of this drug. Finally, we observed sensitivity to cisplatin in cN-II silenced cells and resistance to this same drug in cN-II over-expressing cells indicating an involvement of cN-II in the mechanism of action of platinum derivatives, and most probably in DNA repair. In summary, our findings confirm some previous data on the role of cN-II in the sensitivity of cancer cells to cancer drugs, and suggest its involvement in other cellular phenomenon such as cell proliferation.

Abstract: Oxidised low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is thought to be a significant contributor to the death of macrophage cells observed in advanced atherosclerotic plaques. Using human-derived U937 cells we have examined the effect of cytotoxic oxLDL on oxidative stress and cellular catabolism. Within 3h of the addition of oxLDL, there was a rapid, concentration dependent rise in cellular reactive oxygen species followed by the loss of cellular GSH, and the enzyme activity of both glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and aconitase. The loss of these catabolic enzymes was accompanied by the loss of cellular ATP and lower lactate generation. Addition of the macrophage antioxidant 7,8-dihydroneopterin inhibited the ROS generation, glutathione loss and catabolic inactivation. NOX was shown to be activated by oxLDL addition while apocynin inhibited the loss of GSH and cell viability. The data suggests that oxLDL triggers an excess of ROS production through NOX activation, and catabolic failure through thiol oxidation resulting in cell death.

Abstract: Members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB) family play a critical role in normal cell growth and development. However, many ErbB family members, especially EGFR, are aberrantly expressed or deregulated in tumors and are thought to play crucial roles in cancer development and metastatic progression. In this chapter, we provide an overview of key mechanisms contributing to aberrant EGFR/ErbB signaling in transformed cells, which results in many phenotypic changes associated with the earliest stages of tumor formation, including several hallmarks of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These changes often occur through interaction with other major signaling pathways important to tumor progression, causing a multitude of transcriptional changes that ultimately impact cell morphology, proliferation, and adhesion, all of which are crucial for tumor progression. The resulting mesh of signaling networks will need to be taken into account as new regimens are designed for targeting EGFR for therapeutic intervention. As new insights are gained into the molecular mechanisms of cross talk between EGFR signaling and other signaling pathways, including their roles in therapeutic resistance to anti-EGFR therapies, a continual reassessment of clinical therapeutic regimes and strategies will be required. Understanding the consequences and complexity of EGF signaling and how it relates to tumor progression is critical for the development of clinical compounds and establishing clinical protocols for the treatment of cancer.

Abstract: The high work function metal oxides, tungsten oxide (WOx) and molybdenum oxide (MoOx), were investigated regarding their ability to form a hole-selective contact for a crystalline silicon absorber. We show that in principle both materials have the potential to (i) either replace the p-type amorphous silicon thin films typically used as the high work function contact material in silicon based heterojunction solar cells or (ii) to assist the hole extraction if used as an additional contact layer placed between the p-type amorphous silicon and the TCO electrode. For an integral evaluation of the actual loss mechanisms limiting the contact characteristics both the ability of the contact scheme to passivate the absorber and to selectively extract the excess holes from the absorber are analyzed.

Abstract: Recently, large area hybrid silicon heterojunction cells (SHJ) with nickel/copper (Ni/Cu) plated front contacts were shown to benefit from a simpler processing sequence than n-PERT cells featuring a boron diffused rear emitter. Hybrid refers here to the combination of a diffused front surface field (FSF) and a SHJ rear emitter. In this work, further process simplifications for such hybrid SHJ cells are evaluated. Based on reflectance and adhesion considerations, stacks of tin-doped indium oxide and copper (ITO/Cu) and chromium/silver (Cr/Ag) are tested as alternative to the previously chosen ITO/Ag rear contact stack. Using ITO/Cu/Al as rear contact stack, average efficiencies of 20.8±0.2% are presented on 6-inch wafers. We also demonstrate that the excimer laser annealing step previously employed to form nickel silicides at the front side can be skipped without comprising solder tab adhesion quality.

Abstract: Amorphous molybdenum oxide (MoOx) as a hole collection layer (HCL) in polymer solar cells (PSCs) was prepared by annealing of a peroxo precursor. The power conversion efficiency of PSCs based on a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester was improved to 3.19% by using an MoOx layer prepared by annealing at 200°C in N2 as an alternative for poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). X-ray photoelectron spectra of MoOx layers showed that the peroxide precursor was converted into MoOx by annealing at 100–150°C and that annealing at a high temperature in N2 under unaerated conditions promotes the reduction of Mo6+ species into Mo5+ species. In contrast, ultraviolet photoelectron spectra of an MoOx layer showed that the electric structure of MoOx depends on not the amount of Mo5+ species but the presence or absence of Mo5+ species. These results indicated that an appropriate amount of Mo5+ species in the MoOx layer is important for an efficient MoOx HCL. A stability test revealed the PSCs with MoOx layers had relatively high device stability in air compared to that of PSCs with PEDOT:PSS.

Abstract: In this paper, cheap and efficient photovoltaic cells based on ZnO/Si heterostructure are discussed. These cells contain zinc oxide nanorods (ZnONR) grown by a low temperature hydrothermal method on a p-type silicon surface. The hydrothermal method applied in the present work uses cheap precursors and allows reproducible and controllable growth of 3D systems. As-grown ZnONR on Si surface are uniformly covered by a zinc oxide (ZnO) layer followed by an aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) layer. The latter is deposited on top of the cell as transparent conductive oxide (TCO). Both zinc oxide and aluminum doped zinc oxide layers are grown by a low temperature atomic layer deposition (LT ALD) method. Thickness of ZnO layers is optimized to increase significantly the light-trapping effect and thus the photovoltaic (PV) response. We evaluate impact of ZnO thickness on the PV devices operation. It is found that PV efficiency increases when thickness of the ZnO layer changes from 50nm to 500nm. The best response of solar cells is achieved for a sample containing ZnO layer with a thickness equal to 500nm. The overall photovoltaic response is 10.9% and can be further improved by contact and Si layer optimization.

Abstract: It is currently possible to fabricate crystalline silicon solar cells with the absorber thickness ranging from a few hundreds of micrometres (conventional wafer-based cells) to devices as thin as 1μm. In this work, we use a model single-junction solar cell to calculate the limits of energy conversion efficiency and estimate the optimal absorber thickness. We have found that the limiting efficiency for cells in the thickness range between 40 and 500μm is very similar and close to 29%. In this regard, we argue that decreasing the thickness below around 40μm is counter-productive, as it significantly reduces the maximum achievable efficiency, even when an optimal light trapping is implemented. We analyse the roles of incomplete light trapping and extrinsic (bulk and surface) recombination mechanisms. For a reasonably high material quality, consistent with present-day fabrication techniques, the optimal thickness is always higher than a few tens of micrometres. We identify incomplete light trapping and parasitic losses as a major roadblock for improving the efficiency upon the current record of 25.6% for silicon solar cells. Finally, considering the main parameters that impact the solar cell performance, we quantify the requirements for achieving a given efficiency, which helps us to establish a proper design strategy for high efficiency silicon solar cells.

Abstract: This paper describes the optimization of a technique to make polysilicon/SiOx contacts for silicon solar cells based on doping PECVD intrinsic polysilicon by means of a thermal POCl3 diffusion process. Test structures are used to measure the recombination current density Joc and contact resistivity ρc of the metal/n+ polysilicon/SiOx/silicon structures. The phosphorus diffusion temperature and time are optimized for a range of thicknesses of the SiOx and polysilicon layers. The oxide thickness is found to be critical to obtain a low contact resistivity ρc, with an optimum of about 1.2nm for a thermal oxide and ∼1.4nm for a chemical oxide. A low Joc≤5fA/cm2 has been obtained for polysilicon thicknesses in the range of 32nm–60nm, while ρc increases from 0.016Ωcm2 to 0.070Ω-cm2 due to the bulk resistivity of polysilicon. These polysilicon/SiOx contacts have been applied to the rear of n-type silicon solar cells having a front boron diffusion, achieving Voc=674.6mV, FF=80.4% and efficiency=20.8%, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques developed here to produce high performance solar cells.

Abstract: Broken gap metal oxide tunnel junctions have been created for the first time by sputtering. Using a ceramic ZnO–SnO2 target and a reactively sputtered copper target we deposited ZnSnO3 and Cu2O for the n-type and p-type layers, respectively. The band edges and work functions of these materials are suitable for favorable alignment with the bands of copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) for a tandem CIGS-based solar cell applications. Total junction specific resistivities under 1Ω-cm2 have been achieved with Ohmic current–voltage (I–V) characteristics pointing to a broken gap band alignment. Low temperature I–V measurements confirmed the lack of traps at the interface despite other measurements pointing to an interface where bands overlap. Cu2O films contained copper inclusions, but they were shown, by conductive atomic force microscopy, not to be the dominant paths for conduction across the junction. Post-deposition annealing of junctions demonstrated thermal stability up to 300°C, and the ability to improve conduction and influence device material’s electron affinity by rapid thermal anneal (RTA). Optical transmission over 78% below a band gap of 2.4eV was attained for as-deposited films.

Abstract: We present a method that can be used to quantify and optimize the performance of electrochromic polymers and evaluate how the choice of coating method affects the film characteristics. The mathematical approach, together with a standard experimental procedure to perform it, is described. This method can be applicable to any electrochromic material and deposition technique with the only requirement being that the Beer–Lambert law is followed. Three common (and industrially applicable) coating techniques (namely spray, blade and spin coating), together with three solution processable electrochromic polymers (ECP-Magenta, ECP-Black and ECP-Cyan), were used in the study to illustrate the feasibility of this method. For all the evaluated polymers, the choice of deposition method had a direct effect on the maximum achievable contrast. Spin coated films tended to show the highest contrasts, closely followed by blade coated films and finally spray coated films. When explaining those differences we showed that coloration efficiency, widely used as an electrochromic quality parameter, is not directly related to achievable contrast values. Instead, we have proposed the volumetric redox density. It has been found that higher values of this magnitude translate into higher achievable contrasts.

Abstract: The optical and luminescence properties of CaI2 and NaCl doped with divalent thulium are reported for solar energy applications. These halides strongly absorb solar light from the UV up to 900nm due to the intense Tm2+ 4f13→4f125d1 electronic transitions. Absorption is followed by emission of 1140nm light due to the 2F5/2→2F7/2 transition of the 4f13 configuration that can be efficiently converted to electric power by thin film CuInSe2 (CIS) solar cells. Because of a negligible spectral overlap between absorption and emission spectra, a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) based on these black luminescent materials would not suffer from self-absorption losses. The Tm2+ doped halides may therefore lead to efficient semi-transparent power generating windows that absorb solar light over the whole visible spectrum. It will be shown that the power efficiency of the Tm2+ based LSCs can be up to four times higher compared to LSCs based on organic dyes or quantum dots.

Abstract: Nanoporous NiO/V2O5 hybrid film has been successfully prepared by combining chemical bath deposition (CBD) and electrochemical deposition methods. The electrochemical and optical properties of the hybrid film were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), amperometric i–t, UV–vis spectroscopy and colorimetry analysis. Compared with single V2O5 electrochromic film, the NiO/V2O5 hybrid electrochromic film reveals reasonably good cyclic stability, better transmittance modulation (35% at 776nm) and higher coloration efficiency (30.6C−1cm2 at 776nm). The noticeably improved electrochromic properties are mainly attributed to the introduction of NiO polycrystal substrate with nanoflake-like structure, which helps strengthen the structural stability of V2O5 film and improve the performance of Li+ ions intercalation/deintercalation.

Abstract: Ternary chalcogenide semiconductor Cu2SnS3 (CTS) is an emerging material, attracting increasing interest for the applications in thin film solar cells. Here we report a pulsed laser deposition route to synthesize compact and single phase CTS thin films for the first time. The effects of the annealing temperature on the formation of CTS films were investigated. XRD and Raman studies revealed that the annealed CTS thin films have a polycrystalline nature with a cubic crystal structure, and the crystalline size of the CTS thin films increases as the annealing temperature increases. The direct optical band gap energy of the CTS thin film annealed at 400°C is found to be 1.01eV. Hall effect measurements indicate that the film has a p-type conductivity with a hole mobility of 0.51cm2/Vs. Finally, a thin film solar cell was fabricated with a SLG/Mo/CTS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO/Al structure. A photo-electric conversion efficiency of 0.82% was achieved with a short circuit current density of 11.90mA/cm2. We are successful in achieving the better values of VOC for the CTS solar cells. The route developed here may provide an alternative approach to produce CTS thin film solar cells.

Abstract: Autophagy plays a critical role in response to numerous cellular stresses, such as nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, starvation and organelle damage. The disruption of autophagy pathway affects multiple aspects of cellular stress response. Here we for the first time identified Ccz1 as an essential component for autophagy in Candida albicans. Our experiments demonstrated that loss of CCZ1 gene led to vacuolar fragmentation and disruption of the autophagy pathway. Our results also suggested that Ccz1 functioned in oxidative stress. In the ccz1Δ/Δ mutant, the levels of reactive oxidative species (ROS) sharply increased under H2O2 treatment. Further studies demonstrated that breakdown of the autophagic clearance pathway led to the accumulation of oxidative stress-damaged mitochondria, and consequently elevated cellular ROS levels in the ccz1Δ/Δ mutant. Furthermore, deletion of CCZ1 led to a significant defect in filamentous development at both 30°C and 37°C. The disruption of CCZ1 gene led to decreased capacity of macrophage killing and increased sensitivity to the macrophages. In addition, the ccz1Δ/Δ mutant exhibited attenuated virulence and decreased fungal burdens in the mouse systemic infection model, indicating that CCZ1 might provide a promising target for antifungal drugs development. In summary, our findings provide new insights into the understanding of autophagy-related gene in C. albicans.

Abstract: The copolymerisation of 3,3′″ Dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2″:5″,2′″-quaterthiophene (DHQT) and (R)-(-)-3-(1-pyrrolyl)propyl-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)-α-phenylglycinate (DNBP) was successfully performed electrochemically in acetonitrile (CH3CN) containing tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate ((C4H9)4NBF4) by direct oxidation of monomer mixtures in different feed ratios. Copolymerisation improved the properties of the films of both polymers PDHQT and PDNBP, in respect to the adhesion of PDHQT onto ITO/glass surface and the chromatic contrast of these electrochromic materials. PDHQT, PDNBP and P(DHQT-co-DNBP) films were characterised by FTIR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and spectroelectrochemical techniques. Solutions of PDHQT and its copolymers with DNBP (independently of the feed ratio) in N-methylpyrrolidone are fluorescent with emission bands at 555 and 585nm when excited at 375nm. Reversible changes in the hue and saturation occur in all the copolymer films from yellow or orange in the reduced state to green or blue in the oxidised state, but were dependent on the proportion of the comonomers used to prepare the copolymers. These changes are more significant for P(DHQT-co-DNBP) films deposited onto ITO/glass with 1:5 feed ratio, as shown by the track of the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates and by the electrochromic parameters in which this film (thickness 0.8±0.2μm) presented chromatic contrast (Δ%T) at 660nm of 62%, coloration efficiency (η) of 266cm2C−1 and stability to redox cycling (Δ%T=17% at the 1000th cycle). Therefore, these copolymers are potentially applicable in displays and optoelectronic devices as electrochromic and fluorescent materials.

Abstract: Potential-induced degradation (PID) in photovoltaic (PV) modules based on n-type single crystalline Si solar cell (front junction cell) was experimentally generated by applying negative voltage from an Al plate, which was attached on the front cover glass of the module, to the Si cell. The solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency of the standard n-type Si PV module decreased from 17.8% to 15.1% by applying −1000V at 85°C for 2h. The external quantum efficiency in the range from 400 to 600nm significantly decreased after the PID test, although no change was observed from 800 to 1100nm. PID in n-type Si PV modules can be basically explained by enhanced front surface recombination between electron and hole on the Si cell, whereas the polarity of voltage leading to PID depends on structure of Si cell. An ionomer encapsulant instead of EVA has significantly suppressed PID in n-type Si PV modules.

Abstract: Photo-catalytic oxygen evolution from water oxidation is very important for solar energy utilization and fuel cell production. In this work, cuprous oxide film for photo-catalytic water oxidation and oxygen evolution under visible light was in-situ prepared on a copper foil with an anodization based method. The surface features of cuprous oxide film were characterized with X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The oxygen evolution capacity of as-obtained cuprous oxide film was evaluated with a water photolysis system, and an oxygen yield of 233.27μmol per milligram of cuprous oxide was achieved during 8h of illumination. During the reaction, water was oxidized by the photo-generated holes in cuprous oxide, and the copper/cuprous oxide heterojunction can effectively separate the photo-generated electron–hole pairs, which promote the catalytic activity of cuprous oxide film. The oxygen evolution reaction was driven by the bending of energy band of cuprous oxide caused by the semiconductor-metal contact. The remaining protons by the water oxidation resulted in the acidizing of water.

Abstract: The role of CdCl2 activation in the production of high quality CdTe-based photovoltaic devices remains a subject of much debate. In this study, CdTe-based cells produced in three independent laboratories using different device fabrication technologies are investigated before and after CdCl2 activation with regard to structural changes (recrystallisation and grain growth) and sulphur out-diffusion. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and x-ray diffraction it is demonstrated that CdCl2 activation of the investigated cells produces no statistical structural changes to the CdTe. Additionally, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) performed in the STEM on the same samples illustrates that the change in sulphur diffusion following activation is more limited than expected from previous studies; no change is detectable when the thermal budget for CdTe deposition is significantly greater than that for activation. This suggests that the efficiency enhancement during CdCl2 treatment is not due to sulphur out-diffusion. Lastly, cathodoluminescence microscopy is used to demonstrate in two dimensions how sulphur diffuses into a model sample and the results are found to be consistent with STEM–EDS. Some spectroscopic evidence for enhanced sulphur diffusion along grain boundaries is also observed.

Abstract: Cu–In–Se (CIS) and its based alloys are among the most important solar cell materials. However, there are only limited Cu–In–Se phase equilibria data available. This study determines the liquidus projection of the Cu–In–Se system. Cu–In–Se alloys were prepared from pure constituent elements. The primary solidification phases of as-cast Cu–In–Se alloys were determined. The univariant lines of Cu–In–Se liquidus projection were constructed according to the experimental results determined in this study, those in the literature and the phase diagrams of its three binary constituent systems. There are 15 primary solidification phases in the ternary Cu–In–Se liquidus projection: β1-Cu2Se, Cu, β2-Cu4In, γ-Cu7In3, η′-Cu2In, Cu11In9, In, In4Se3, InSe, In6Se7, In2Se3, Se, CuSe2, CuSe and CuInSe2 phases. A large miscibility gap extends from the Cu–Se side to the In–Se side. There are 16 ternary invariant reactions in this Cu–In–Se liquidus projection involved in the liquid phase. The temperatures of invariant reactions were determined using differential thermal analysis.

Abstract: A comprehensive outdoor study of polymer solar cells and modules for duration of one year was conducted. Different sample geometries and encapsulations were employed in order to study the spread in the lifetimes. The study is a complimentary report to previous work that focused on indoor ageing tests. Comparison of the indoor and outdoor lifetimes was performed by means of the o-diagram, which constitutes the initial steps towards establishing a method for predicting the lifetime of an organic photovoltaic device under real operational conditions based on a selection of accelerated indoor tests. Acceleration factors were determined using the ISOS-protocols, which enabled reproducible data acquisition between different laboratories and operators within the OPV community. A semi-automatic filtering method was employed for processing data acquired in outdoor tests. It was found that the lifetime of the samples tested under outdoor conditions was somewhere between the lifetimes of samples measured in accelerated indoor test conditions of damp heat and light soaking (ISOS-D-3 and ISOS-L-2) and in moderate indoor test conditions (shelf life and high temperature storage). The presented results reveal that while the accelerated ageing studies reveal days and weeks of lifetime for the studied samples, in outdoor real operational conditions the samples demonstrate stability up to months and seasons.

Abstract: This paper reports the gasochromic effect in colloidal nanoparticles of tungsten oxide dihydrate synthesized via a simple electrochemical anodizing of tungsten in an electrolyte composed of 0.02M HCl. The anodizing caused the electrolyte to convert to a light yellowish colloidal solution consisting of tungsten oxide dihydrate. The ultimate gasochromic colloidal solutions were obtained just by addition of different volumes of 0.2g/l PdCl2 solution as a source of hydrogen catalyst into the primary colloidal tungsten dihydrate solution. Different tools involving, X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and furrier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy characterized the colloidal nanoparticles. XRD measurements revealed that the as-prepared nanoparticles are monoclinic WO3·2(H2O) and were converted to monoclinic WO3 by annealing at temperatures above 300°C. XPS showed that the hydroxyl groups and W5+ states are dominant in as-prepared sample and lower after annealing or loading PdCl2. It was observed that the Pd-WO3·2(H2O) solutions which were colorless initially, turned into blue color after dilute hydrogen insertion and then into the colorless state by spontaneously bleaching in ambient air. Moreover, no coloring was observed for colloidal solution composed of monoclinic WO3. The optical absorption spectra of colloidal samples in colored states were composed of three certain distinct absorption peaks located at 1.3, 1.6 and 1.9eV. The intensities of first and third peaks were comparable and dominant at deep blue states but, upon bleaching, the second one gradually overcomes them. We attributed this dynamical behavior to the possible surface and bulk phenomena. Finally, the obtained optical absorption results were compared with the small polaron hopping model.

Abstract: TiO2 nanotubes have demonstrated perspective applications in the photovoltaic field. They can reduce both the transport dimensionality and the recombination of the photoinjected electrons. In this paper, arrays of TiO2 nanotubes were fabricated by anodization of Ti foils in an ethylene glycol solution containing hydrofluoric acid (HF) under a constant voltage. From field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images, we observed the microstructure of titania nanotubes. Images show that, as-anodized, the surface of the nanotubes is covered with a precipitate. Ultrasonic treatment was used to remove this precipitate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that the as-anodized amorphous TiO2 nanotubes are converted to crystalline anatase after the samples have been annealed at 500°C during 2h. Electrochemical behaviour (in terms of charge transfer resistance) was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The annealed samples were characterized by electrochemical tests. A schematic representation of the TiO2 nanotubes consisting of two layers (i.e. dense and nanoporous) is proposed to explain the obtained results.

Abstract: Modified spray method (m-SM) was used to fabricate 8at%-lithium-doped NiO (NiO:8-Li) films using the nickel nitrate [Ni(NO3)2·6H2O] and lithium nitrate (LiNO3) solutions. The NiO:8-Li solutions were sprayed on glass substrates and annealed at various temperatures. It found that the resistivity was decreased and the optical bandgap value were increased as annealing temperature of the NiO:8-Li films was increased from 400°C to 600°C. As the annealing temperature increased, the ratio (fitting area) of Ni3+/Ni2+ in the NiO:8-Li films decreased, which was caused by the increasing in carrier concentration. When the NiO:8-Li films was deposited on ITO glass substrates, the rectifying current–voltage (I–V) properties confirmed that a p–n heterojunction diode characteristic was successfully formed in a NiO:8-Li/ITO structure. The NiO:8-Li/ITO heterojunction parameters such as ideality factor (n), barrier height (φb), and series resistance (Rs) were determined using conventional forward bias I–V characteristics, Cheung׳s and Norde׳s methods. The ideality factor of 3.3, barrier height of ~0.72eV, and the series resistance of ~0.21kΩ were estimated using I–V characteristics.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the fabrication of Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin film absorbers by a four-step solution process based on ZnS, SnS and Cu3SnS4 nanoparticle precursors and their application in thin film solar cells. The influence of ligand-exchange process on the morphologies of the resulting CZTSSe thin films was studied. Ligand exchange with each sequential spun coat layers leads to cracking films which can be avoided by combining ligand-exchanged and non-ligand-exchanged processes. Moreover, a two-step annealing process yields the most homogeneous films. CZTSSe thin films consisting a large grain and fine nanoparticle grain layered structure was formed. The formation of layered structure for the absorbers was found to be due to the existence of high content of carbon left near the back contact and the out diffusion of Cu and Zn from the bottom layer to the surface layer. As a result, solar cell conversion efficiency was improved from 1.2% to 3.0% upon adoption a two-step annealing process. Temperature dependent I–V characteristic analysis reveals the dominant loss mechanism of the solar cells is the strong CZTSSe and CdS buffer interface recombination.

Abstract: The microencapsulation of paraffin as a phase change material (PCM) using poly methyl methacrylate (PMM) as a shell was investigated by means of suspension polymerization. The increase in the emulsion stability by using mixed surfactants was studied. It was observed that a mixed surfactants system induces long-term emulsion stability and monodisperse droplets size distribution. Also, the use of mixed surfactants reduces significantly the buckles in microcapsules significantly. The effect of using pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETRA) as a cross-linker agent on the diverse properties of PCM microcapsules such as morphology, energy storage density, shell permeability and thermal stability has been investigated. Adding PETRA to the system improves the surface morphology and produces microcapsules with a much higher PCM content. For example, the core/shell mass ratio of 2:1 produces microcapsules with regular spheres having smooth surfaces. TGA results show two steps thermal degradation of microcapsules. The mass loss was similar to the non-encapsulated PCM until all the PCM was dissipated (step 1). Following that the microcapsules experienced lower rate of mass loss of the shell, which depends on its thickness (step 2).

Abstract: Polo-like kinases (PLKs) family has long been known to be critical for cell cycle and recent studies have pointed to new dimensions of PLKs function in the nervous system. Our previous study has verified that the levels of PLK3 in the brain are severely downregulated in prion-related diseases. However, the associations of PLKs with prion protein remain unclear. In the present study, we confirmed that PrP protein constitutively interacts with PLK3 as determined by both in vitro and in vivo assays. Both the kinase domain and polo-box domain of PLK3 were proved to bind PrP proteins expressed in mammalian cell lines. Overexpression of PLK3 did not affect the level of wild-type PrP, but significantly decreased the levels of the mutated PrPs in cultured cells. The kinase domain appeared to be responsible for the clearance of abnormally aggregated PrPs, but this function seemed to be independent of its kinase activity. RNA-mediated knockdown of PLK3 obviously aggravated the accumulation of cytosolic PrPs. Moreover, PLK3 overexpression in a scrapie infected cell line caused notable reduce of PrPSc level in a dose-dependent manner, but had minimal effect on the expression of PrPC in its normal partner cell line. Our findings here confirmed the molecular interaction between PLK3 and PrP and outlined the regulatory activity of PLK3 on the degradation of abnormal PrPs, even its pathogenic isoform PrPSc. We, therefore, assume that the recovery of PLK3 in the early stage of prion infection may be helpful to prevent the toxic accumulation of PrPSc in the brain tissues.

Abstract: This paper deals with the thermal performances of shape-stabilized phase change materials (SSPCMs) for energy saving in various fields. Two SSPCMs were prepared by impregnating coconut oil and palm oil, as phase change materials (PCMs), into exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGnP), as a supporting material. Coconut oil and palm oil are types of organic fatty acid ester PCMs made from under-used and renewable feedstocks. However, they have a major drawback, namely their low thermal conductivity. To improve the thermal conductivity of organic fatty acid ester PCMs, xGnP can be effective. Therefore we prepared form-stable organic fatty acid ester PCMs with xGnP, using the vacuum impregnation method. In this study we used coconut oil and palm oil, which have latent heat capacities of 110.4 and 127.3J/g and melting points of 26.78 and 17.26°C, respectively. The organic fatty acid ester PCMs were incorporated into the porous structure of xGnP. The thermal conductivity of the produced SSPCMs were over 400% higher than pure fatty-acid ester PCM. Also, the latent heat were 82.34 and 77.18J/g, respectively. The characteristics of the organic fatty acid ester PCMs were determined by using SEM, DSC, FT-IR, TGA and TCi.

Abstract: In this work, a series of stain steel 15×15cm2 CuInS2 solar cells with efficiencies close to the record one for this kind of devices, are analyzed. Through a careful and comprehensive study of the structural and electronic properties of the CuInS2 layer, we show that in a general fashion the strain originated by the thermal annealing affects the energy band splitting and reduces the short circuit current. Then, through an innovative combination of photoreflectance and Raman scattering analysis, we demonstrate that the presence of CuAu domains in the bulk layer of a CuInS2 is directly related with this strain reduction contributing to the improvement of short circuit current. We propose that the presence Cu–Au phase domains reduce the strain within the CuInS2 layer, and improve the quality of the CIS chalcopyrite crystals, leading to reduced carrier recombination while increasing carriers mobility. As a consequence we conclude that the presence of said domains improves the short circuit current in the studied devices.

Abstract: Past two years have seen the rapid emergence of a new class of solar cell based on mixed organic–inorganic halide perovskites. The optical and optical frequency dielectric properties of these perovskites at ambient temperatures are important both to the design of optimised solar cells and in other areas such as the refinement of electronic band structure calculations. Limited previous information has been published. The experimental optical and related dielectric constants of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films are reported at 297K as determined by detailed analysis of reflectance and transmittance data. Absorption coefficients are also extracted from these data and compared with a range of previously reported values.

Abstract: Fabrication of nanostructure in various typed solar cell is of great importance in terms of the improvement of charge carrier collection and junction area. Here, we report that well-aligned nanopillar arrays are spontaneously developed in the process of the spin coating when a polymer is added to specific porphyrin–fullerene complexes. The nanopillars embedded in the polymers are composed of donor–acceptor assembled systems, based on J-type aggregation of a low-molecular zinc porphyrin derivative and subsequent integration of pyridylated fullerene derivative with coordination and orientation. The diameter and the height of the nanopillars can be controlled by the side chain-length and the concentration of the polymer as well as drying time after the spin coating. Structural, optical, and electrical properties of the nanopillar are also investigated. Finally, improved power conversion efficiency in the porphyrin–fullerene nanopillar is experimentally observed compared to that of the planar thin film prepared under similar conditions.

Abstract: Tubular Si-infiltrated SiCf/SiC composites composed of an inner cellular ceramic and an outer dense ceramic matrix composite (CMC) skin were fabricated by the electrophoretic deposition of matrix phases followed by Si-infiltration for solar receiver applications in concentrated solar energy. Using a combined replica method with the 3D printing of polymeric inks, 3 types of the inner cellular ceramics were produced to examine the permeability and heat transfer properties depending on their structure. To form a gastight dense skin layer, SiC fibers were layered on the cylindrical cellular ceramics by filament winding. The resulting preforms were infiltrated by electrophoretic deposition with SiC and carbon black particles and then by molten Si at 1550°C. The fabrication process, resulting microstructure, and oxidation behavior of the composites at 1400 and 1600°C in air are explained in Part 1. The thermophysical properties will be explained in Part 2. Overall, this hybrid method is a suitable processing technology for fabricating SiCf/SiC-based solar receivers.

Abstract: Cool materials targeted to minimize temperature are employed to lower energy consumption and the heat island effect. UV damage of cool materials appears to be inevitable when they serve as outdoor applications. Among researches into cool materials, the effect of UV irradiation on cooling property and stability of materials have been barely considered. In this work, UV irradiation of high density polyethylene (HDPE)/titanium dioxide (TiO2) composites were performed via the artificial accelerated xenon lamp UV irradiation process. Structural changes were studied by wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). A spectrometer was applied to measure solar reflectance before and after UV irradiation. The advantage of the high solar reflectance of the specimen remained after UV irradiation. The relationship between UV irradiation and solar reflectance was discussed. The solar reflectance after UV irradiation depended on changes of the crystallinity, surface roughness of composite and the structure of TiO2. It was interesting to find that the anatase TiO2 particle could slightly increase the solar reflectance in the near infrared region after UV irradiation, which may provide an approach to achieve high reflectance of polymeric materials in the near infrared region. Finally, the temperature test was conducted to evaluate the effect of UV irradiation on the actual cooling property by a self-designed device, of which, the result was in accordance with the result of solar reflectance.

Abstract: Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are the most numerous cells in the heart and are recognized primarily for their ability to maintain both the structural integrity and the physiological functions of the heart. The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway is reportedly involved in the modulation of CF functions, including apoptosis. Recent studies have indicated that microRNA-101 (miR-101) attenuates the TGF-β signaling pathway, either by inhibiting the expression of TGFβ1 or by targeting transforming growth factor-β receptor type I (TGFβRI). The present study aimed to determine whether miR-101 protects CFs from hypoxia-induced apoptosis and to investigate the mechanisms underlying its protective effects. The CCK-8 test, electron microscopy and TUNEL assay results demonstrated that miR-101a/b significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced CF apoptosis. The results of Western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence assays indicated that miR-101a dramatically inhibited the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of both TGFβRI and p-Smad 3 but not TGFβ1 in CFs. Additionally, miR-101a significantly reversed the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of Bax and Caspase-3, the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and the activation of Caspase-3 in CFs. Moreover, miR-101a markedly inhibited the intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) overload caused by hypoxia. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-101a protects CFs against hypoxia-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway, which may be a potential therapeutic target for heart injury.

Abstract: Photochromic glasses have attracted increasing interests as switchable lenses and radiation dosimeters. Here, we report on a new and cheap photochromatic material, Mn2+ activated borophosphate glass which can be readily prepared by the conventional melt-quenching method. The photochromic properties are characterized by differential absorption spectra, and the photochromism stems from the conversion of Mn2+ to Mn3+ when the glass samples are exposed to gamma-rays. Our results show that the photochromism can be controlled by modifying the glass structure and optical basicity through adding of alkali (Na2O) and alkali-earth (SrO, BaO and CaO) oxides.

Abstract: Color design for large-area hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) semi-transparent glass-to-glass (GTG) photovoltaic (PV) modules has been studied for the application to building integrated PV (BIPV) modules. Three-dimensional color space of CIE (Commission Internationale de l'éclairage) L*a*b* (CIELAB) is adopted for a systematic color analysis. Three kinds of design configurations are invented by combining the transparency of back contacts and laser patterning techniques. In addition, the realization of emotionally stable and esthetic color is challenged using color back encapsulating materials. Transparent back contact (TBC)-type modules with green color are fabricated via the most simplified processes without sacrificing any active area. Bright and esthetic hybrid-type modules are also fabricated using additional laser-scribed patterns and blue encapsulating film. It is found that opaque back contact (OBC)-type module design is the best way to achieve target color together with the highest conversion efficiency. Because color of the back encapsulating materials does not deteriorate the conversion efficiency, the developed design concepts are promising options for large-area semi-transparent BIPV modules.

Abstract: Selective thermal emitters concentrate most of their spontaneous emission in a spectral band much narrower than a blackbody. When used in a thermophovoltaic energy conversion system, they become key elements defining both its overall system efficiency and output power. Selective emitters׳ radiation spectra must be designed to match their accompanying photocell׳s band gap and simultaneously, withstand high temperatures (above 1000K) for long operation times. The advent of nanophotonics has allowed the engineering of very selective emitters and absorbers; however, thermal stability remains a challenge since nanostructures become unstable at temperatures much below the melting point of the used materials. In this paper we explore a hybrid 3D dielectric–metallic structure that combines the higher thermal stability of a monocrystalline 3D silicon scaffold with the optical properties of a thin platinum film conformally deposited on top. We show experimentally that these structures exhibit a selective emission spectrum suitable for TPV applications and that they are thermally stable at temperatures up to 1100K. These structures are ideal in combination with III–V semiconductors in the range Eg=0.4–0.55eV such as InGaAsSb (Eg=0.5–0.6eV) and InAsSbP (Eg=0.3–0.55eV).

Abstract: Insufficient and/or improper protein degradation is associated with the development of various human pathologies. Enzymatic therapy with proteolytic enzymes aimed to improve insufficient proteolytic activity was suggested as a treatment of protease deficiency-induced disorders. Since in many cases human degradome is incapable of degrading the entire target protein(s), other organisms can be used as a source of proteases exhibiting activities distinct from human enzymes, and plants are perspective candidates for this source. In this study recombinant wheat cysteine protease Triticain-α was shown to refold in vitro into an autocatalytically activated proteolytic enzyme possessing glutenase and collagenase activities at acidic (or close to neutral) pH levels at the temperature of human body. Mass-spectrometry analysis of the products of Triticain-α-catalyzed gluten hydrolysis revealed multiple cleavage sites within the sequences of gliadin toxic peptides, in particular, in the major toxic 33-mer α-gliadin-derived peptide initiating inflammatory responses to gluten in celiac disease (CD) patients. Triticain-α was found to be relatively stable in the conditions simulating stomach environment. We conclude that Triticain-α can be exploited as a basic compound for development of (i) pharmaceuticals for oral administration aimed at release of the active enzyme into the gastric lumen for CD treatment, and (ii) topically active pharmaceuticals for wound debridement applications.

Abstract: We demonstrate that n-type black silicon can be passivated efficiently using Atomic Layer Deposited (ALD) Al2O3, reaching maximum surface recombination velocities below 7cm/s. We show that the low surface recombination velocity results from a higher sensitivity of the nanostructures to surface charge and from the absence of surface damage after black silicon etching. The surface recombination velocity is shown to be inversely proportional to the fourth power of the negative charge in contrast to the quadratic dependence observed in planar surfaces. This effect compensates the impact of the increased surface area in the nanostructures and extends the potential of black silicon for instance to n-type Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) cells.

Abstract: A stearic acid (SA)/graphene composite microcapsule, having a core–shell structure, is prepared for the first time using a latex technology for use as a novel composite phase change material (PCM) for thermal energy management. Melted SA is dispersed in water using an anionic surfactant as a stabilizer and cooled to prepare a water-based latex containing negatively charged SA particles. A simple mixing of this latex with an aqueous dispersion of graphene, prepared with aid of a cationic surfactant, results in the self-assembly of graphene on a SA particle surface by an electrostatic interaction, allowing for the encapsulation of SA with graphene to form a core–shell composite microcapsule. The protective graphene shell gives an excellent shape stability to the composite during phase change and a substantial improvement in thermal stability of the active SA core. In addition, the core–shell structure contains a high weight fraction of the active core material due to the ultra-thin graphene shell having high thermal conductivity. This results in a high performance PCM with a large latent heat and an improved thermal conductivity.

Abstract: In many applications such as solar power conversion technologies, radiative heat transfer plays a significant role in the energy balance. For accurate performance predictions of solar power conversion devices the total hemispherical emittance and solar absorptance of surfaces need to be known with high accuracy. Often times the emittance of a surface is calculated from indirect spectral bidirectional or directional-hemispherical reflection measurements at room temperature which can significantly underestimate the total hemispherical emittance. Here, we report a simple steady-state calorimetric method to directly measure the total hemispherical emittance of opaque surfaces at elevated temperatures with a maximum experimental uncertainty of 5%. The method is further expanded to directly measure the solar absorptance of the surface at elevated temperature using a solar simulator. We show experimental total hemispherical emittance and solar absoprtance results for various surfaces such as machine polished copper and stainless steel and several spectrally selective solar absorbers. We describe a methodology to characterize solar absorbers and apply it to a cermet-based spectrally selective solar absorber.

Abstract: Sputtering and subsequent sulfurization (or selenization) is one of the methods that have been extensively employed to fabricate Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin films. However, there are limited reports on the effect of precursor stacking order of the sputtered source materials on the properties of the synthesized CZTSSe films. In this work, the morphology and crystallization process of the CZTSSe films which were prepared by selenizing Cu–ZnS–SnS precursor layers with different stacking sequences and the adhesion property between the as-synthesized CZTSSe layer and Mo substrate have been thoroughly investigated. It has been found that the growth of CZTSSe material and the morphology of the film strongly depend on the location of Cu layer in the precursor film. The formation of CZTSSe starts from the diffusion of Cu–Se to Sn(S,Se) layer to form Cu–Sn–(S,Se) compound, followed by the reaction with Zn(S,Se). The investigation of the morphology of the CZTSSe films has shown that large grains are formed in the film with the precursor stacking order of Mo/SnS/ZnS/Cu, which is attributed to a bottom-to-top growth mechanism. In contrast, the film made from a precursor with a stacking sequence of Mo/ZnS/SnS/Cu is mainly consisted of small grains due to a top-to-bottom growth mechanism. The best CZTSSe solar cell with energy conversion efficiency of 3.35% has been achieved with the selenized Mo/ZnS/SnS/Cu film, which is attributed to a good contact between the absorber layer and the Mo substrate.

Abstract: This study deals with the preparation and characterization of the composites of polyethylene glycol (PEG)/the synthesized polymeric solid-solid phase change material (SSPCM) as novel form stable phase change material (FSPCM) for thermal energy storage. The synthesized SSPCM can play two roles in the FSPCM: the supporting material and the phase change working substance. The influence of PEG content on crystalline properties and phase change behaviors of the FSPCMs was investigated. The polarizing optical microscopy (POM) images of FSPCMs show that all FSPCMs have the spherocrystal morphology, and the spherocrystal size of SSPCM increases with the increasing of PEG percent. The results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicate that the prepared FSPCMs with different PEG contents have high thermal storage density, and the enthalpy efficiency of them is much higher than that of the traditional FSPCMs due to the synergistic phase change effect of PEG and SSPCM. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum and DSC curve of the FSPCMs after thermal cycling are almost the same as those of the original samples, which indicates that the FSPCMs have excellent thermal reliability and reusability. The work not only supplied a kind of novel FSPCMs with high performances, but also proposed a new way to solve the problem of enthalpy decline of traditional FSPCMs and synthesized polymeric SSPCMs compared with solid-liquid PCMs.

Abstract: We investigate the possibility to combine silicon carbide with transition metal carbide (MC) in a nanocomposite type structure in order to enhance the optical properties of this material. Metal carbides have been prepared starting from colloidal oxide, with carbon introduced by sucrose followed by the complete conversion from oxide to carbide at 1550°C through a carbothermal reduction under Ar atmosphere. The optical properties of individual metal carbides (SiC, TiC, ZrC and HfC) were first evaluated through their room temperature reflectance spectra measured from UV–visible to IR region. Emphasis was placed on the TiC compound as well as in the implementation of nanoscale SiC/TiC composite with respect to their intrinsic and spectral emittance properties.

Abstract: Analysis of the degradation routes for poly[(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl] (PCPDTBT)-based solar cells under illumination and in the presence of air have been conducted using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and solar cell device data. After ageing, XPS studies show that PCPDTBT appears as an oxygen-containing polymer, with data indicating that a break-up in the aromatic rings, formation of sulphates at the thiophene ring, chain scission in the polymer backbone and also loss of side chains. XPS studies have also been conducted on Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) films and show a breakage of the fullerene cage, loss of molecular shape and oxidation of carbon atoms in the fullerene cage and side chains after ageing. XPS studies on active layers blends of PCPDTBT and PCBM also show significant changes in the vertical composition during ageing, with increased enrichment of PCPDTBT observed at the top surface and that the use of a processing additive (ODT) has a negative impact on the morphological stability. Based on these studies, it is shown that inverted structures are better suited than non-inverted devices for PCPDTBT:PCBM solar cells. An additional advantage of inverted devices is shown using TOF-SIMS; electrode degradation during ageing experiments leads to migration of indium and tin ions into the active layer in non-inverted devices, but is eliminated for inverted devices.

Abstract: The LexA protein of the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 exhibits a RecA-independent and alkaline pH-dependent autoproteolytic cleavage. The autoproteolytic cleavage of Anabaena LexA occurs at pH 8.5 and above, stimulated by the addition of Ca2+ and in the temperature range of 30–57°C. Mutational analysis of Anabaena LexA protein indicated that the cleavage occurred at the peptide bond between Ala-84 and Gly-85, and optimal cleavage required the presence of Ser-118 and Lys-159, as also observed for LexA protein of Escherichia coli. Cleavage of Anabaena LexA was affected upon deletion of three amino acids, 86GLI. These three amino acids are unique to all cyanobacterial LexA proteins predicted to be cleavable. The absence of RecA-dependent cleavage at physiological pH, which has not been reported for other bacterial LexA proteins, is possibly due to the absence of RecA interacting sites on Anabaena LexA protein, corresponding to the residues identified in E. coli LexA, and low cellular levels of RecA in Anabaena. Exposure to SOS-response inducing stresses, such as UV-B and mitomycin C neither affected the expression of LexA in Anabaena nor induced cleavage of LexA in either Anabaena 7120 or E. coli overexpressing Anabaena LexA protein. Though the LexA may be acting as a repressor by binding to the LexA box in the vicinity of the promoter region of specific gene, their derepression may not be via proteolytic cleavage during SOS-inducing stresses, unless the stress induces increase in cytoplasmic pH. This could account for the regulation of several carbon metabolism genes rather than DNA-repair genes under the regulation of LexA in cyanobacteria especially during high light induced oxidative stress.

Abstract: The effects of prolonged exposure to reverse bias DC electric fields and illumination as a function of temperature in hydrogenated amorphous Si (a-Si:H) photovoltaic p–i–n cells have been investigated. These are strongly affected by the well known Staebler–Wronski effect, occurring during light soaking of a-Si:H photovoltaic cells. In this work we show that the application of a reverse bias stress in presence of illumination not only slows down the solar cell ageing kinetics but even produces an improvement of the cells parameters as a function of stress time. We discuss the effect of temperature, electric field intensity and illumination level. We also show that different types of bottom contact over which the a-Si:H is grown by PECVD have a strong influence on the recovery-improvement kinetics: SnO:F (FTO) transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and molybdenum bottom contacts to the p-type a-Si:H layer are here compared. Finally, we demonstrate that an analogous improvement (reduction) of sheet resistance is observed in single thin films of doped a-Si:H deposited on SiO2 under the application of high intensity electric fields.

Abstract: Since the beginning of PV module production, Soxhlet extraction has been the standard method for the determination of the gel content and the resulting calculation of the degree of crosslinking of the most common PV encapsulant ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). While the method is deemed well established and several pertinent ASTM and ISO standards exist, in practise the actual procedures used in – and trusted by – both industry and R&D institutions vary substantially. To evaluate the reliability of the methods and the comparability of the results, a round-robin test involving seven independent European laboratories – one industrial PV module manufacturer and six R&D facilities – was conducted. The measurements were performed using homogenous, anonymized sample sets, each comprising five differently crosslinked EVA foils. The analysis showed that results obtained for the same samples may deviate significantly, but also that very different analytical procedures can yield comparable values. In a systematic study, the impact of various key parameters of the analytical process (extraction time and solvent, drying conditions, sample size and weight etc.) was investigated. Based on these findings, deviations observed in the round-robin study could be linked to their origins and the main pitfalls were identified. In conclusion, a suggestion for an optimised standard procedure was derived to ensure comparable results at all laboratories.

Abstract: With the projected growth in photovoltaics the demand of glass for the solar industry will far exceed the current supply, and thousands of new float-glass plants will have to be built to meet its needs over the next 20 years. Such expansion will provide an opportunity for the solar industry to obtain products better suited to their needs, such as low-iron glass and borosilicate glass at the lowest possible price. While there are no significant technological hurdles that would prevent the flat glass industry from meeting the solar industry׳s projected needs, to do so will require advance planning and substantial investments.

Abstract: The energy band diagram of the hetero-interface between p-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H(p+)) and n-type crystalline silicon (c-Si(n)) obtained using AFORS-HET one dimensional device simulations reveals that a p+ inversion layer is induced at the hetero-interface, in the c-Si side, with or without the presence of a buffer intrinsic a-Si:H(i) spacer. Such an inversion layer controls the performance of the a-Si:H(p+)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si(n) HIT cell, because it pushes the p/n junction 20nm in the c-Si and acts as the cell effective emitter. The formation of the inversion layer is controlled by the valence band offset and by the positioning of the Fermi energy in the energy band-gap. The latter is influenced by the active doping level in the doped a-Si:H(p+) and by the dangling bond defect density in the a-Si:H bulk and at the a-Si:H/c-Si interface. By inserting an intrinsic a-Si:H spacer, the defect density at the interface is strongly reduced, which not only decreases the interface recombination, but also ensures the proper formation of the inversion layer. The study also suggests that significantly reduced band-gap narrowing in the inversion layer emitter contributes to the higher open circuit voltage achieved in the HIT cell compared to c-Si cell with excellent front surface passivation.

Abstract: Physical characterization and thermal properties of bischofite, a by-product from the non-metallic industry, were determined and compared with those to MgCl2·6H2O with the idea of using it as phase change material in thermal energy storage applications. The melting point and heat of fusion were measured in the temperature range from 30°C to 150°C, where Tfus and ΔHfus were 100°C and 115kJ/kg for bischofite, and 114.5°C and 135kJ/kg for MgCl2·6H2O. The solid heat capacity was determined from 25°C to 60°C, being 2.1kJ/(kgK) at 60°C for both samples. The measurements of the liquid heat capacity of bischofite were done from 115°C to 125°C and the Cp showed linear increase from 1.71kJ/(kgK) to 3.01kJ/(kgK). The thermal stability test (30 heating/cooling cycles) of bischofite and MgCl2·6H2O shows subcooling of about 37K and 29K, respectively. The solid and liquid densities were determined using the pycnometrically method; for bischofite, ρsolid decrease from 1686 (at 30°C) to 1513kg/m3 (at 50°C) and ρliq was 1481kg/m3 (at 115°C). Based on the thermophysical properties evaluated, the energy storage density was evaluated for both materials, being 170J/cm3 for bischofite and 192J/cm3 for MgCl2·6H2O. This study established that bishofite is a promissory PCM with similar thermophysical characteristics to magnesium chloride hydrate, but with a lower cost. Nevertheless, further work is needed to overcome the two main problems found, subcooling and segregation of the material.

Abstract: The poor optical transmittance of common electrodes based on thin metal films in three-terminal parallel tandem solar cells poses a major hindrance to attaining high power conversion efficiency (PCE). High optical transmittance and electrical conductivity of the common electrodes are crucial to achieving high PCE. We report a parallel polymer tandem solar cell that contains a comb-shaped electrode (CSE) based on gold (Au), which provides both high optical transmittance and low electrical resistance. We studied the performance of the tandem cell devices as a function of number of teeth N of the CSEs with tooth dimensions of 50μm (width)×30nm (thickness)×3mm (length). A maximum PCE of 3.72%, which amounts to 85% of the PCE of an ideal tandem cell, was obtained with N=5 in the tandem structure ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PC71BM/PEDOT:PSS+Triton X-100/Au CSE/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/LiF/Al, where ITO is indium tin oxide, P3HT is regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene), PC71BM is [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester, PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid), Triton X-100 is 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenyl-polyethylene glycol, and PTB7 is thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene. The combination of high optical transmittance and low electrical resistance of the Au CSE and the conductivity-enhanced hole transport layer of PEDOT:PSS+Triton X-100 resulted in a 20% higher PCE than that obtained using conventional common electrodes based on 12nm thick Au films. We analyzed the resistance of the combined anode, which consists of the Au CSE and the PEDOT:PSS+Triton X-100 film, theoretically. The theoretical results enabled us to predict the optimum number of teeth required for the Au CSEs to give the maximum PCE in three-terminal parallel tandem cells, and showed excellent agreement with the experimental results.

Abstract: Silicon germanium alloys are of great interest for thin film solar cells, thanks to their adjustable bandgap and stronger absorption when compared to Si. SiGe alloys are herein epitaxially grown on (100) c-Si substrates at 175°C in a standard RF-PECVD reactor from H2/SiH4/GeH4 precursor gas mixture. A linear correlation is found between the GeH4/(SiH4+ GeH4) gas ratio and Ge content in the layer, with epitaxial growth being maintained up to 35% Ge. The alloy composition deduced from spectroscopic ellipsometry shows excellent agreement with Raman spectroscopy, glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy and SIMS-MCs+ analysis. Epitaxial SiGe strain and defects, arising from lattice mismatch, are studied as function of Ge atomic percentage by Raman and transmission electron microscopy. The SiGe electrical quality is investigated by making heterojunctions solar cells stacks, consisting of (p++)c-Si wafer/epi-Si0.63Ge0.27/(n)aSi:H, and comparing their characteristics to pure silicon equivalent devices. External quantum efficiency confirmed a short circuit current of 18.8mA/cm2 with a thin 1.9µm absorber and flat interfaces, along with a fill factor of 77.5% and an open circuit voltage of 416mV, resulting in a conversion efficiency of 6.1%.

Abstract: Detailed ellipsometric studies were carried out to measure the refractive indices (n) and extinction coefficients (k) of the HfMoN(H)/HfMoN(L)/HfON/Al2O3 tandem absorber in the wavelength range of 300–1000nm. The experimentally measured ellipsometric parameters have been fitted with simulated spectra using the Tauc–Lorentz model for generating dispersion of optical constants of the individual layers. Using these n and k values a three layer HfMoN/HfON/Al2O3 spectrally solar selective coating was designed and simulated using Essential Macleod software. The optical constants and thicknesses obtained from the simulation were used to develop the three layer tandem absorber with high absorptance and low emittance. The three layer tandem absorber has been deposited on stainless steel (SS) substrates using a magnetron sputtering system. The spectrophotometric data showed that the three layer tandem absorber exhibits high absorptance of 0.95 with low emittance of 0.14 on SS substrate and these values are similar to that of four layer HfMoN(H)/HfMoN(L)/HfON/Al2O3 tandem absorber.

Abstract: Interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) belongs to a superfamily of proteins characterized by an intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain. This domain harbors three conserved regions called boxes 1-3 that play crucial roles in mediating IL-1 responses. Boxes 1 and 2 are considered to be involved in binding of adapter molecules. Amino acids possibly crucial for IL-1RI signaling were predicted via homology models of the IL-1RI TIR domain based on the crystal structure of IL-1RAPL. The role of ten of these residues was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and a functional luciferase assay reflecting NF-κB activity in transiently transfected Jurkat cells. In particular, the mutants E437K/D438K, E472A/E473A and S465A/S470A/S471A/E472A/E473A showed decreased and the mutant E437A/D438A increased IL-1 responsiveness compared to the mouse IL-1RI wild type. In conclusion, the αC′ helix (Q469-E473 in mouse IL-1RI) is probably involved in heterotypic interactions of IL-1RI with IL-1RAcP or MyD88.
