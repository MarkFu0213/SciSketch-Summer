Abstract: Endothelial cells (ECs) provide nutrients and oxygen essential for tissue homeostasis. Metabolic imbalances and other environmental stimuli, like cytokines or low shear stress, trigger endothelial inflammation, increase permeability, compromise vascular tone, promote cell proliferation, and ultimately cause cell death. These factors contribute to EC dysfunction, which is crucial in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have important functions in the regulation of ECs. In the present review, we discuss the role of miRNAs in various aspects of EC pathology in cardiometabolic diseases like atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome, and in complication of those pathologies, like ischemia. We also discuss the potential therapeutic applications of miRNAs in promoting angiogenesis and neovascularization in tissues where the endothelium is damaged in different cardiometabolic diseases.

Abstract: It is well documented that fatty acids serve as the primary fuel substrate for the contracting myocardium. However, extensive research has identified significant changes in the myocardial oxidation of fatty acids during acute or chronic cardiac stress. As a result, the redistribution or partitioning of fatty acids due to metabolic derangements could have biological implications. Fatty acids can be stored as triacylglycerols, serve as critical components for biosynthesis of phospholipid membranes, and form the potent signaling molecules, diacylglycerol and ceramides. Therefore, the contribution of lipid metabolism to health and disease is more intricate than a balance of uptake and oxidation. In this review, the available data regarding alterations that occur in endogenous cardiac lipid pathways during the pathological stressors of ischemia–reperfusion and pathological hypertrophy/heart failure are highlighted. In addition, changes in endogenous lipids observed in exercise training models are presented for comparison. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Heart Lipid Metabolism edited by G.D. Lopaschuk.

Abstract: The incorporation of glycerol into lipid was measured using SV40 transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from either wild-type (WT) mice or from mice in which the epsilon isoform of diacylglycerol kinase (DGKε) was knocked out (DGKε−/−). We present an explanation for our finding that DGKε−/− MEFs exhibited greater uptake of 3H-glycerol into the cell and a greater incorporation into lipids compared with their WT counterparts, with no change in the relative amounts of various lipids between the DGKε−/− and WT MEFs. Glycerol kinase is more highly expressed in the DGKε−/− cells than in their WT counterparts. In addition, the activity of glycerol kinase is greater in the DGKε−/− cells than in their WT counterparts. Other substrates that enter the cell independent of glycerol kinase, such as pyruvate or acetate, are incorporated into lipid to the same extent between DGKε−/− and WT cell lines. We also show that expression of p53, a transcription factor that increases the synthesis of glycerol kinase, is increased in DGKε−/− MEFs in comparison to WT cells. We conclude that the increased incorporation of glycerol into lipids in DGKε−/− cells is a consequence of up-regulation of glycerol kinase and not a result of an increase in the rate of lipid synthesis. Furthermore, increased expression of the pro-survival gene, p53, in cells knocked out for DGKε suggests that cells over-expressing DGKε would have a greater propensity to become tumorigenic.

Abstract: Plasma high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations negatively correlate with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. HDL is thought to have several atheroprotective functions, which are likely distinct from the epidemiological inverse relationship between HDL-C levels and risk. Specifically, strategies that reduce HDL-C while promoting reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) may have therapeutic value. The major product of the serum opacity factor (SOF) reaction versus HDL is a cholesteryl ester (CE)-rich microemulsion (CERM), which contains apo E and the CE of ~400,000 HDL particles. Huh7 hepatocytes take up CE faster when delivered as CERM than as HDL, in part via the LDL-receptor (LDLR). Here we compared the final RCT step, hepatic uptake and subsequent intracellular processing to cholesterol and bile salts for radiolabeled HDL-, CERM- and LDL-CE by Huh7 cells and in vivo in C57BL/6J mice. In Huh7 cells, uptake from LDL was greater than from CERM (2–4X) and HDL (5–10X). Halftimes for [14C]CE hydrolysis were 3.0±0.2, 4.4±0.6 and 5.4±0.7h respectively for HDL, CERM and LDL-CE. The fraction of sterols secreted as bile acids was ~50% by 8h for all three particles. HDL, CERM and LDL-CE metabolism in mice showed efficient plasma clearance of CERM-CE, liver uptake and metabolism, and secretion as bile acids into the gall bladder. This work supports the therapeutic potential of the SOF reaction, which diverts HDL-CE to the LDLR, thereby increasing hepatic CE uptake, and sterol disposal as bile acids.

Abstract: Triacylglycerol (TAG), a major source of biodiesel production, accumulates in nitrogen-starved Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. However, the metabolic pathway of starch-to-TAG conversion remains elusive because an enzyme that affects the starch degradation is unknown. Here, we isolated a new class of mutant bgal1, which expressed an overaccumulation of starch granules and defective photosynthetic growth. The bgal1 was a null mutant of a previously uncharacterized β-galactosidase-like gene (Cre02.g119700), which decreased total β-galactosidase activity 40% of the wild type. Upon nitrogen starvation, the bgal1 mutant showed decreased TAG accumulation mainly due to the reduced flux of de novo TAG biosynthesis evidenced by increased unsaturation of fatty acid composition in TAG and reduced TAG accumulation by additional supplementation of acetate to the culture media. Metabolomic analysis of the bgal1 mutant showed significantly reduced levels of metabolites following the hydrolysis of starch and substrates for TAG accumulation, whereas metabolites in TCA cycle were unaffected. Upon nitrogen starvation, while levels of glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate and acetyl-CoA remained lower, most of the other metabolites in glycolysis were increased but those in the TCA cycle were decreased, supporting TAG accumulation. We suggest that BGAL1 may be involved in the degradation of starch, which affects TAG accumulation in nitrogen-starved C. reinhardtii.

Abstract: Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is a multifunctional homodimeric protein, and is the key enzyme required for the anabolic conversion of dietary carbohydrates to fatty acids. FAS synthesizes long-chain fatty acids from three substrates: acetyl-CoA as a primer, malonyl-CoA as a 2 carbon donor, and NADPH for reduction. The entire reaction is composed of numerous sequential steps, each catalyzed by a specific functional domain of the enzyme. FAS comprises seven different functional domains, among which the β-ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain carries out the key condensation reaction to elongate the length of fatty acid chain. Acyl tail length controlled fatty acid synthesis in eukaryotes is a classic example of how a chain building multienzyme works. Different hypotheses have been put forward to explain how those sub-units of FAS are orchestrated to produce fatty acids with proper molecular weight. In the present study, molecular dynamic simulation based binding free energy calculation and access tunnels analysis showed that the C16 acyl tail fatty acid, the major product of FAS, fits to the active site on KS domain better than any other substrates. These simulations supported a new hypothesis about the mechanism of fatty acid production ratio: the geometric shape of active site on KS domain might play a determinate role.

Abstract: Cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2α) plays a key role in signaling in mammalian cells by releasing arachidonic acid (AA) from glycerophospholipids (GPLs) but the factors determining the specificity of cPLA2α for AA-containing GPLs are not well understood. Accordingly, we investigated those factors by determining the activity of human cPLA2α towards a multitude of GPL species present in micelles or bilayers. Studies on isomeric PC sets containing a saturated acyl chain of 6 to 24 carbons in the sn1 or sn2 position in micelles showed an abrupt decrease in hydrolysis when the length of the sn1 or sn2 chain exceeded 17 carbons suggesting that the acyl binding cavity on the enzyme is of the corresponding length. Notably, the saturated isomer pairs were hydrolyzed identically in micelles as well as in bilayers suggesting promiscuous binding of acyl chains to the active site of cPLA2α. Such promiscuous binding would explain the previous finding that cPLA2α has both PLA1 and PLA2 activities. Interestingly, increasing the length of either the sn1 or sn2 acyl chain inhibited the hydrolysis in bilayers far more than that in micelles suggesting that with micelles (loosely packed) substrate accommodation at the active site of cPLA2α is rate-limiting, while with bilayers (tightly packed) upward movement of the substrate from the bilayer (efflux) is the rate-limiting step. With the AA-containing PCs, the length of the saturated acyl chain also had a much stronger effect on hydrolysis in bilayers vs. micelles in agreement with this model. In contrast to saturated PCs, a marked isomer preference was observed for AA-containing PCs both in micelles and bilayers. In conclusion, these data significantly help to understand the mode of action and specificity of cPLA2α.

Abstract: PLA2G6 or GVIA calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2β) is identified as one of the NAFLD modifier genes in humans, and thought to be a target for NAFLD therapy. iPLA2β is known to play a house-keeping role in phospholipid metabolism and remodeling. However, its role in NAFLD pathogenesis has not been supported by results obtained from high-fat feeding of iPLA2β–null (PKO) mice. Unlike livers of human NAFLD and genetically obese rodents, fatty liver induced by high-fat diet is not associated with depletion of hepatic phospholipids. We therefore tested whether iPLA2β could regulate obesity and hepatic steatosis in leptin-deficient mice by cross-breeding PKO with ob/ob mice to generate ob/ob–PKO mice. Here we observed an improvement in ob/ob–PKO mice with significant reduction in serum enzymes, lipids, glucose, insulin as well as improved glucose tolerance, and reduction in islet hyperplasia. The improvement in hepatic steatosis measured by liver triglycerides, fatty acids and cholesterol esters was associated with decreased expression of PPARγ and de novo lipogenesis genes, and the reversal of β-oxidation gene expression. Notably, ob/ob livers contained depleted levels of lysophospholipids and phospholipids, and iPLA2β deficiency in ob/ob–PKO livers lowers the former, but replenished the latter particularly phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) that contained arachidonic (AA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. Compared with WT livers, PKO livers also contained increased PE and PC containing AA and DHA. Thus, iPLA2β deficiency protected against obesity and ob/ob fatty liver which was associated with hepatic fatty-acyl phospholipid remodeling. Our results support the deleterious role of iPLA2β in severe obesity associated NAFLD.

Abstract: Expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), a molecule facilitating cholesterol efflux to HDL, is activated by liver X receptor (LXR). In this study, we investigated if inhibition of ERK1/2 can activate macrophage ABCG1 expression and functions. MEK1/2 inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, increased ABCG1 mRNA and protein expression, and activated the natural ABCG1 promoter but not the promoter with the LXR responsive element (LXRE) deletion. Inhibition of ABCG1 expression by ABCG1 siRNA did enhance the formation of macrophage/foam cells and it attenuated the inhibitory effect of MEK1/2 inhibitors on foam cell formation. MEK1/2 inhibitors activated macrophage cholesterol efflux to HDL in vitro, and they enhanced reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in vivo. ApoE deficient (apoE−/−) mice receiving U0126 treatment had reduced sinus lesions in the aortic root which was associated with activated macrophage ABCG1 expression in the lesion areas. MEK1/2 inhibitors coordinated the RXR agonist, but not the LXR agonist, to induce ABCG1 expression. Furthermore, induction of ABCG1 expression by MEK1/2 inhibitors was associated with activation of SIRT1, a positive regulator of LXR activity, and inactivation of SULT2B1 and RIP140, two negative regulators of LXR activity. Taken together, our study suggests that MEK1/2 inhibitors activate macrophage ABCG1 expression/RCT, and inhibit foam cell formation and lesion development by multiple mechanisms, supporting the concept that ERK1/2 inhibition is anti-atherogenic.

Abstract: Cardiolipin and phosphatidic acid-binding protein (CLPABP) is a pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein and is localized on the surface of mitochondria of cultured cells as a large protein–RNA complex. To analyze the physiological functions of CLPABP, we established and characterized a CLPABP knockout (KO) mouse. Although expression levels of CLPABP transcripts in the developmental organs were high, CLPABP KO mice were normal at birth and grew normally when young. However, old male mice presented a fatty phenotype, similar to that seen in metabolic syndrome, in parallel with elevated male- and age-dependent CLPABP gene expression. One of the reasons for this obesity in CLPABP KO mice is dependence on increases in leptin concentration in plasma. The leptin transcripts were also upregulated in the adipose tissue of KO mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. To understand the difference in levels of the transcriptional product, we focused on the effect of CLPABP on the stability of mRNA involving an AU-rich element (ARE) in its 3′UTR dependence on the RNA stabilizer, human antigen R (HuR), which is one of the CLPABP-binding proteins. Increase in stability of ARE-containing mRNAs of leptin by HuR was antagonized by the expression of CLPABP in cultured cells. Depletion of CLPABP disturbed the normal subcellular localization of HuR to stress granules, and overexpression of CLPABP induced instability of leptin mRNA by inhibiting HuR function. Consequently, leptin levels in old male mice might be regulated by CLPABP expression, which might lead to body weight control.

Abstract: Lipids are essential components for life. Their various structural and physical properties influence diverse cellular processes and, thereby, human health. Lipids are not genetically encoded but are synthesized and modified by complex metabolic pathways, supplying energy, membranes, signaling molecules, and hormones to affect growth, physiology, and response to environmental insults. Lipid homeostasis is crucial, such that excess fatty acids (FAs) can be harmful to cells. To prevent such lipotoxicity, cells convert excess FAs into neutral lipids for storage in organelles called lipid droplets (LDs). These organelles do not simply manage lipid storage and metabolism but also are involved in protein quality management, pathogenesis, immune responses, and, potentially, neurodegeneration. In recent years, a major trend in LD biology has centered around the physiology of lipid mobilization via lipophagy of fat stored within LDs. This review summarizes key findings in LD biology and lipophagy, offering novel insights into this rapidly growing field.

Abstract: We have examined the lipids of three isolates, Romboutsia lituseburensis, Romboutsia ilealis, and Romboutsia sp. strain FRIFI, of the newly described genus Romboutsia by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (2D-TLC) and by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). We have found three phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), cardiolipin and phosphatidic acid in all three species. A fourth phospholipid, lysyl-PG, was found in R. lituseburensis and strain FRIFI. Polyprenyl-phosphates were identified in the lipid extracts of all three species. Three glycolipids, mono-, di- and tri-hexosyldiacylglycerol, were common to all three species. An additional glycolipid, tetrahexosyl-diacylglycerol was identified in strain FRIFI. Acylated trihexosyldiacylglycerol and acyl-tetrahexosydiacylglycerol were also found in R. ilealis and strain FRIFI. Remarkably, no alk-1-enyl ether lipids (plasmalogens) were present in Romboutsia as distinct from bacteria of the related genus Clostridium in which these ether lipids are common. We have compared the lipidome of Romboutsia with that recently described for Clostridium difficile, which has plasmalogens, no lysyl-PG, and no tetrahexosyl-diacylglycerol. According to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, Romboutsia spp. and C. difficile are closely related (>95% sequence identity).

Abstract: SND1 is a multifunctional protein participating, among others, in gene transcription and mRNA metabolism. SND1 is overexpressed in cancer cells and promotes viability and tumourigenicity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This study shows that cholesterol synthesis is increased in SND1-overexpressing hepatoma cells. Neither newly synthesised nor extracellularly supplied cholesterol are able to suppress this increase; however, inhibition of cholesterol esterification reverted the activated state of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and cholesterogenesis. These results highlight SND1 as a potential regulator of cellular cholesterol distribution and homeostasis in hepatoma cells, and support the rationale for the therapeutic use of molecules that influence cholesterol management when SND1 is overexpressed.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional inhibitory regulators of gene expression by binding to complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. Extracellular miRNAs are transported by membrane-derived vesicles (exosomes and microparticles), lipoproteins, and other ribonucleoprotein complexes. Extracellular microRNAs are emerging as important mediators of intercellular communications, being involved in the transmission of biological signals between cells. Several miRNAs have been identified as having a primary impact on many biological processes that are of direct relevance to cardiovascular complications of diabetes. Whether the extracellular miRNAs are directly involved in the regulation of these processes is yet to be established. Here, we review recent progresses in extracellular miRNA biology and the role of extracellular miRNA in diabetes induced cardiovascular disease, describing the regulators affecting miRNA transport and the mechanisms for different miRNA transporters. In addition, we discuss the advancement of the research in this field and identify the associated challenges.

Abstract: Lipid droplet formation, which is driven by triglyceride synthesis, requires several droplet-associated proteins. We identified ARAP2 (an ADP-ribosylation factor 6 GTPase-activating protein) in the lipid droplet proteome of NIH-3T3 cells and showed that knockdown of ARAP2 resulted in decreased lipid droplet formation and triglyceride synthesis. We also showed that ARAP2 knockdown did not affect fatty acid uptake but reduced basal glucose uptake, total levels of the glucose transporter GLUT1, and GLUT1 levels in the plasma membrane and the lipid micro-domain fraction (a specialized plasma membrane domain enriched in sphingolipids). Microarray analysis showed that ARAP2 knockdown altered expression of genes involved in sphingolipid metabolism. Because sphingolipids are known to play a key role in cell signaling, we performed lipidomics to further investigate the relationship between ARAP2 and sphingolipids and potentially identify a link with glucose uptake. We found that ARAP2 knockdown increased glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide levels without affecting ceramide levels, and thus speculated that the rate-limiting enzyme in glycosphingolipid synthesis, namely glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), could be modified by ARAP2. In agreement with our hypothesis, we showed that the activity of GCS was increased by ARAP2 knockdown and reduced by ARAP2 overexpression. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of GCS resulted in increases in basal glucose uptake, total GLUT1 levels, triglyceride biosynthesis from glucose, and lipid droplet formation, indicating that the effects of GCS inhibition are the opposite to those resulting from ARAP2 knockdown. Taken together, our data suggest that ARAP2 promotes lipid droplet formation by modifying sphingolipid metabolism through GCS.

Abstract: Cholesterol levels in intracellular membranes are constantly adjusted to match with specific organelle functions. Cholesterol is kept high in the plasma membrane (PM) because it is essential for its barrier function, while low levels are found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where cholesterol mediates feedback control of its own synthesis by sterol-sensor proteins. The ER→Golgi→PM concentration gradient of cholesterol in mammalian cells, and ergosterol in yeast, appears to be sustained by specific intracellular transport processes, which are mostly mediated by lipid transfer proteins (LTPs). Here we review a recently described function of two LTPs, OSBP and its yeast homolog Osh4p, which consists in creating a sterol gradient between membranes by vectorial transport. OSBP also contributes to the formation of ER/Golgi membrane contact sites, which are important hubs for the transfer of several lipid species. OSBP and Osh4p organize a counterflow transport of lipids whereby sterols are exchanged for the phosphoinositide PI4P, which is used as a fuel to drive sterol transport.

Abstract: Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are fatty acids with backbones containing more than one double bond, which are introduced by a series of desaturases that insert double bonds at specific carbon atoms in the fatty acid chain. It has been established that desaturases need flavoprotein-NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 reductase (simplified as cytochrome b5 reductase) and cytochrome b5 to pass through electrons for activation. However, it has remained unclear how this multi-enzyme system works for distinct desaturases. The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans contains seven desaturases (FAT-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7) for the biosynthesis of PUFAS, providing an excellent model in which to characterize different desaturation reactions. Here, we show that RNAi inactivation of predicted cytochrome b5 reductases hpo-19 and T05H4.4 led to increased levels of C18:1n−9 but decreased levels of PUFAs, small lipid droplets, decreased fat accumulation, reduced brood size and impaired development. Dietary supplementation with different fatty acids showed that HPO-19 and T05H4.4 likely affect the activity of FAT-1, FAT-2, FAT-3, and FAT-4 desaturases, suggesting that these four desaturases use the same cytochrome b5 reductase to function. Collectively, these findings indicate that cytochrome b5 reductase HPO-19/T05H4.4 is required for desaturation to biosynthesize PUFAs in C. elegans.

Abstract: Phosphoinositides and soluble inositol phosphates are essential components of a complex intracellular chemical code that regulates major aspects of lipid signaling in eukaryotes. These involvements span a broad array of biological outcomes and activities, and cells are faced with the problem of how to compartmentalize and organize these various signaling events into a coherent scheme. It is in the arena of how phosphoinositide signaling circuits are integrated and, and how phosphoinositide pools are functionally defined and channeled to privileged effectors, that phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) transfer proteins (PITPs) are emerging as critical players. As plant systems offer some unique advantages and opportunities for study of these proteins, we discuss herein our perspectives regarding the progress made in plant systems regarding PITP function. We also suggest interesting prospects that plant systems hold for interrogating how PITPs work, particularly in multi-domain contexts, to diversify the biological outcomes for phosphoinositide signaling.

Abstract: Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption has been associated with reduced cardiovascular risk but molecular mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects are not fully understood. Here we aimed to identify genes and miRNAs expression changes mediated by acute high- and low-polyphenols EVOO intake. Pre- and post-challenge gene and miRNAs expression analysis was performed on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 12 healthy subjects and 12 patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) by using microarray and RT-qPCR. In healthy subjects, acute intake of EVOO rich in polyphenols was able to ameliorate glycaemia and insulin sensitivity, and to modulate the transcription of genes and miRNAs involved in metabolism, inflammation and cancer, switching PBMCs to a less deleterious inflammatory phenotype; weaker effects were observed in patients with MS as well as in healthy subjects following low-polyphenol EVOO challenge. Concluding, our study shows that acute high-polyphenols EVOO intake is able to modify the transcriptome of PBMCs through the modulation of different pathways associated with the pathophysiology of cardio-metabolic disease and cancer. These beneficial effects are maximized in healthy subjects, and by the use of EVOO cultivars rich in polyphenols. Nutrigenomic changes induced by EVOO thus legitimate the well-known beneficial effects of EVOO in promoting human health and, potentially, preventing the onset of cardiovascular disease and cancer.

Abstract: In recent years, endocannabinoids emerged as new players in various reproductive events. Recently, we demonstrated the involvement of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in human cytotrophoblast apoptosis and syncytialization. However, 2-AG impact in hormone production by the syncytiotrophoblast (hST) was never studied. In this work, we demonstrate that 2-AG activates cannabinoid (CB) receptors, exerting an inhibitory action on cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 pathways, and enhancing ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, 2-AG affects the synthesis of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), leptin, aromatase, 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3-β-HSD), and placental protein 13 (PP13). These 2-AG effects are mediated by the activation of CB receptors, in a mechanism that may involve p38, ERK 1/2 and cAMP/PKA pathways, which participate in the regulation of placental proteins expression. To our knowledge, this is the first study that associates the endocannabinoid signalling and endocrine placental function, shedding light on a role for 2-AG in the complex network of molecules that orchestrate the production of placental proteins essential for the gestational success.

Abstract: Sphingolipids and their phosphorylated derivatives are ubiquitous bio-active components of cells. They are structural elements in the lipid bilayer and contribute to the dynamic nature of the membrane. They have been implicated in many cellular processes in yeast and animal cells, including aspects of signaling, apoptosis, and senescence. Although sphingolipids have a better defined role in animal systems, they have been shown to be central to many essential processes in plants including but not limited to, pollen development, signal transduction and in the response to biotic and abiotic stress. A fuller understanding of the roles of sphingolipids within plants has been facilitated by classical biochemical studies and the identification of mutants of model species. Recently the development of powerful mass spectrometry techniques hailed the advent of the emerging field of lipidomics enabling more accurate sphingolipid detection and quantitation. This review will consider plant sphingolipid biosynthesis and function in the context of these new developments.

Abstract: Brite adipocytes recently discovered in humans are of considerable importance in energy expenditure by converting energy excess into heat. This property could be useful in the treatment of obesity, and nutritional aspects are relevant to this important issue. Using hMADS cells as a human cell model which undergoes a white to a brite adipocyte conversion, we had shown previously that arachidonic acid, the major metabolite of the essential nutrient Ω6-linoleic acid, plays a major role in this process. Its metabolites PGE2 and PGF2 alpha inhibit this process via a calcium-dependent pathway, whereas in contrast carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2), a stable analog of prostacyclin, activates white to brite adipocyte conversion. Herein, we show that cPGI2 generates via its cognate cell-surface receptor IP-R, a cyclic AMP-signaling pathway involving PKA activity which in turn induces the expression of UCP1. In addition, cPGI2 activates the pathway of nuclear receptors of the PPAR family, i.e. PPARα and PPARγ, which act separately from IP-R to up-regulate the expression of key genes involved in the function of brite adipocytes. Thus dual pathways are playing in concert for the occurrence of a browning process of human white adipocytes. These results make prostacyclin analogs as a new class of interesting molecules to treat obesity and associated diseases.

Abstract: Bacteria and fungi can undergo symbiotic or pathogenic interactions with plants. Membrane lipids and lipid-derived molecules from the plant or the microbial organism play important roles during the infection process. For example, lipids (phospholipids, glycolipids, sphingolipids, sterol lipids) are involved in establishing the membrane interface between the two organisms. Furthermore, lipid-derived molecules are crucial for intracellular signaling in the plant cell, and lipids serve as signals during plant–microbial communication. These signal lipids include phosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol, lysophospholipids, and free fatty acids derived from phospholipase activity, apocarotenoids, and sphingolipid breakdown products such as ceramide, ceramide-phosphate, long chain base, and long chain base-phosphate. Fatty acids are the precursors for oxylipins, including jasmonic acid, and for azelaic acid, which together with glycerol-3-phosphate are crucial for the regulation of systemic acquired resistance.

Oleate dose-dependently regulates palmitate metabolism and insulin signaling in C2C12 myotubes,

Abstract: Because the protective effect of oleate against palmitate-induced insulin resistance may be lessened in skeletal muscle once cell metabolism is overloaded by fatty acids (FAs), we examined the impact of varying amounts of oleate on palmitate metabolic channeling and insulin signaling in C2C12 myotubes. Cells were exposed to 0.5mM of palmitate and to increasing doses of oleate (0.05, 0.25 and 0.5mM). Impacts of FA treatments on radio-labelled FA fluxes, on cellular content in diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), ceramides, acylcarnitines, on PKCθ, MAPKs (ERK1/2, p38) and NF-ΚB activation, and on insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation were examined. Low dose of oleate (0.05mM) was sufficient to improve palmitate complete oxidation to CO2 (+29%, P<0.05) and to alter the cellular acylcarnitine profile. Insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation was 48% higher in that condition vs. palmitate alone (p<0.01). Although DAG and ceramide contents were significantly decreased with 0.05mM of oleate vs. palmitate alone (−47 and −28%, respectively, p<0.01), 0.25mM of oleate was required to decrease p38 MAPK and PKCθ phosphorylation, thus further improving the insulin signaling (+32%, p<0.05). By contrast, increasing oleate concentration from 0.25 to 0.5mM, thus increasing total amount of FA from 0.75 to 1mM, deteriorated the insulin signaling pathway (−30%, p<0.01). This was observed despite low contents in DAG and ceramides, and enhanced palmitate incorporation into TAG (+27%, p<0.05). This was associated with increased incomplete FA β-oxidation and impairment of acylcarnitine profile. In conclusion, these combined data place mitochondrial β-oxidation at the center of the regulation of muscle insulin sensitivity, besides p38 MAPK and PKCθ.

Abstract: Metabolomics studies of human plasma demonstrate a correlation of lower plasma lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) concentrations with insulin resistance, obesity, and inflammation. This relationship is not unraveled on a molecular level. Here we investigated the effects of the abundant LPC(16:0) and LPC(18:1) on human skeletal muscle cells differentiated to myotubes. Transcriptome analysis of human myotubes treated with 10μM LPC for 24h revealed enrichment of up-regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) target transcripts, including ANGPTL4, PDK4, PLIN2, and CPT1A. The increase in both PDK4 and ANGPTL4 RNA expression was abolished in the presence of either PPARδ antagonist GSK0660 or GSK3787. The induction of PDK4 by LPCs was blocked with siRNA against PPARD. The activation of PPARδ transcriptional activity by LPC was shown as PPARδ-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression and enhanced DNA binding of the PPARδ/RXR dimer. On a functional level, further results show that the LPC-mediated activation of PPARδ can reduce fatty acid-induced inflammation and ER stress in human skeletal muscle cells. The protective effect of LPC was prevented in the presence of the PPARδ antagonist GSK0660. Taking together, LPCs can activate PPARδ, which is consistent with the association of high plasma LPC levels and PPARδ-dependent anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common and devastating malignancies among women worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that malignant progression is also driven by processes involving the sphingolipid molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its binding to cognate receptor subtypes on the cell surface. To investigate the effect of this interaction on the metastatic phenotype, we used the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and the sublines 4175 and 1833 derived from lung and bone metastases in nude mice, respectively. In both metastatic cell lines expression of the S1P3 receptor was strongly upregulated compared to the parental cells and correlated with higher S1P-induced intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), higher cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and microsomal prostaglandin (PG) E2 synthase expression, and consequently with increased PGE2 synthesis. PGE2 synthesis was decreased by antagonists and siRNA against S1P3 and S1P2. Moreover, in parental MDA-MB-231 cells overexpression of S1P3 by cDNA transfection also increased PGE2 synthesis, but only after treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, indicating reversible silencing of the COX-2 promoter. Functionally, the metastatic sublines showed enhanced migration and Matrigel invasion in adapted Boyden chamber assays, which further increased by S1P stimulation. This response was abrogated by either S1P3 antagonism, COX-2 inhibition or PGE2 receptor 2 (EP2) and 4 (EP4) antagonism, but not by S1P2 antagonism. Our data demonstrate that in breast cancer cells overexpression of S1P3 and its activation by S1P has pro-inflammatory and pro-metastatic potential by inducing COX-2 expression and PGE2 signaling via EP2 and EP4.

Abstract: The enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) catalyzes the committed step of the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS) pathway by converting acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Two forms of ACCase exist in nature, a homomeric and heteromic form. The heteromeric form of this enzyme requires four different subunits for activity: biotin carboxylase; biotin carboxyl carrier protein; and α- and β-carboxyltransferases. Heteromeric ACCases (htACCase) can be found in prokaryotes and the plastids of most plants. The plant htACCase is regulated by diverse mechanisms reflected by the biochemical and genetic complexity of this multienzyme complex and the plastid stroma where it resides. In this review we summarize the regulation of the plant htACCase and also describe the structural characteristics of this complex from both prokaryotes and plants.

Abstract: Deciphering many roles played by inositol lipids in signal transduction and membrane function demands experimental approaches that can detect their dynamic accumulation with subcellular accuracy and exquisite sensitivity. The former criterion is met by imaging of fluorescence biosensors in living cells, whereas the latter is facilitated by biochemical measurements from populations. Here, we introduce BRET-based biosensors able to detect rapid changes in inositol lipids in cell populations with both high sensitivity and subcellular resolution in a single, convenient assay. We demonstrate robust and sensitive measurements of PtdIns4P, PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 dynamics, as well as changes in cytoplasmic Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels. Measurements were made during either experimental activation of lipid degradation, or PI 3-kinase and phospholipase C mediated signal transduction. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated synthesis of PtdIns4P that accompanies moderate activation of phospholipase C signaling downstream of both EGF and muscarinic M3 receptor activation. This signaling-induced PtdIns4P synthesis relies on protein kinase C, and implicates a feedback mechanism in the control of inositol lipid metabolism during signal transduction.

Abstract: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) functions as a key component in the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway involved in multiple processes in eukaryotes. The role and regulation of TOR-S6K in lipid metabolism remained unknown in plants. Here we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that TOR-Raptor2-S6K1 is important for thylakoid galactolipid biosynthesis and thylakoid grana modeling in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Genetic suppression of S6K1 caused pale yellow-green leaves, defective thylakoid grana architecture. S6K1 directly interacts with Raptor2, a core component in TOR signaling, and S6K1 activity is regulated by Raptor2 and TOR. Plants with suppressed Raptor2 expression or reduced TOR activity by inhibitors mimicked the S6K1-deficient phenotype. A significant reduction in galactolipid content was found in the s6k1, raptor2 mutant or TOR-inhibited plants, which was accompanied by decreased transcript levels of the set of genes such as lipid phosphate phosphatase α5 (LPPα5), MGDG synthase 1 (MGD1), and DGDG synthase 1 (DGD1) involved in galactolipid synthesis, compared to the control plants. Moreover, loss of LPPα5 exhibited a similar phenotype with pale yellow–green leaves. These results suggest that TOR-Raptor2-S6K1 is important for modulating thylakoid membrane lipid biosynthesis, homeostasis, thus enhancing thylakoid grana architecture and normal photosynthesis ability in rice.

Abstract: Although the key metabolic regulatory functions of mammalian peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) have been thoroughly studied, the molecular mechanisms and metabolic regulation of PPARα activation in fish are less known. In the first part of the present study, Nile tilapia (Nt)PPARα was cloned and identified, and high mRNA expression levels were detected in the brain, liver, and heart. NtPPARα was activated by an agonist (fenofibrate) and by fasting and was verified in primary hepatocytes and living fish by decreased phosphorylation of NtPPARα and/or increased NtPPARα mRNA and protein expression. In the second part of the present work, fenofibrate was fed to fish or fish were fasted for 4weeks to investigate the metabolic regulatory effects of NtPPARα. A transcriptomic study was also performed. The results indicated that fenofibrate decreased hepatic triglyceride and 18C-series fatty acid contents but increased the catabolic rate of intraperitoneally injected [1-14C] palmitate in vivo, hepatic mitochondrial β-oxidation efficiency, the quantity of cytochrome b DNA, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a mRNA expression. Fenofibrate also increased serum glucose, insulin, and lactate concentrations. Fasting had stronger hypolipidemic and gene regulatory effects than those of fenofibrate. Taken together, we conclude that: 1) liver is one of the main target tissues of the metabolic regulation of NtPPARα activation; 2) dephosphorylation is the basal NtPPARα activation mechanism rather than enhanced mRNA and protein expression; 3) activated NtPPARα has a hypolipidemic effect by increasing activity and the number of hepatic mitochondria; and 4) PPARα activation affects carbohydrate metabolism by altering energy homeostasis among nutrients.

In this study, HDL increased endothelial annexin A1 and prevented the decrease of annexin A1 in TNF-α-activated endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo, and above effects were attenuated after knockdown of annexin A1. Annexin A1 modulation affected HDL-mediated inhibition of monocyte adhesion to TNF-α-activated endothelium (45.2±13.7% decrease for annexin A1 RNA interference; 78.7±16.3% decrease for anti-Annexin A1 antibody blocking; 11.2±6.9% increase for Ad-ANXA1 transfection). Additionally, HDL up-regulated annexin A1 through scavenger receptor class B type I, involving ERK, p38MAPK, Akt and PKC signaling pathways, and respective inhibitors of these pathways attenuated HDL-induced annexin A1 expression as well as impaired HDL-mediated inhibition of monocyte–endothelial cell adhesion. Apolipoprotein AI also increased annexin A1 and activated similar signaling pathways. Endothelial annexin A1 from apolipoprotein AI knockout mice was decreased in comparison to that from wild type mice. Finally, HDL-induced annexin A1 inhibited cell surface VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin, and secretion of MCP-1, IL-8, VCAM-1 and E-selectin, thereby inhibiting monocyte adhesion.

Abstract: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays essential role in metabolic- and thermoregulation and displays morphological and functional plasticity in response to environmental and metabolic challenges. BAT is a heterogeneous tissue containing adipocytes and various immune-related cells, however, their interaction in regulation of BAT function is not fully elucidated. Fractalkine is a chemokine synthesized by adipocytes, which recruits fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1)-expressing leukocytes into the adipose tissue. Using transgenic mice, in which the fractalkine receptor, Cx3cr1 gene was replaced by Gfp, we evaluated whether deficiency in fractalkine signaling affects BAT remodeling and function in high-fat-diet - induced obesity. Homo- and heterozygote male CX3CR1-GFP mice were fed with normal or fat enriched (FatED) diet for 10weeks. Interscapular BAT was collected for molecular biological analysis. Heterozygous animals in which fractalkine signaling remains intact, gain more weight during FatED than CX3CR1 deficient gfp/gfp homozygotes. FatED in controls resulted in macrophage recruitment to the BAT with increased expression of proinflammatory mediators (Il1a, b, Tnfa and Ccl2). Local BAT inflammation was accompanied by increased expression of lipogenic enzymes and resulted in BAT “whitening”. By contrast, fractalkine receptor deficiency prevented accumulation of tissue macrophages, selectively attenuated the expression of Tnfa, Il1a and Ccl2, increased BAT expression of lipolytic enzymes (Atgl, Hsl and Mgtl) and upregulated genes involved thermo-metabolism (Ucp1, Pparg Pgc1a) in response to FatED. These results highlight the importance of fractalkine-CX3CR1 interaction in recruitment of macrophages into the BAT of obese mice which might contribute to local tissue inflammation, adipose tissue remodeling and regulation of metabolic-related genes.

Abstract: Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) loss of function reduces adiposity whereas partial mTORC1 inhibition enhances fat deposition. Herein we evaluated how constitutive mTORC1 activation in adipocytes modulates adiposity in vivo. Mice with constitutive mTORC1 activation in adipocytes induced by tuberous sclerosis complex (Tsc)1 deletion and littermate controls were evaluated for body mass, energy expenditure, glucose and fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial function, mRNA and protein contents. Adipocyte-specific Tsc1 deletion reduced visceral, but not subcutaneous, fat mass, as well as adipocyte number and diameter, phenotypes that were associated with increased lipolysis, UCP-1 content (browning) and mRNA levels of pro-browning transcriptional factors C/EBPβ and ERRα. Adipocyte Tsc1 deletion enhanced mitochondrial oxidative activity, fatty acid oxidation and the expression of PGC-1α and PPARα in both visceral and subcutaneous fat. In brown adipocytes, however, Tsc1 deletion did not affect UCP-1 content and basal respiration. Adipocyte Tsc1 deletion also reduced visceral adiposity and enhanced glucose tolerance, liver and muscle insulin signaling and adiponectin secretion in mice fed with purified low- or high-fat diet. In conclusion, adipocyte-specific Tsc1 deletion enhances mitochondrial activity, induces browning and reduces visceral adiposity in mice.

Abstract: Although human plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL) concentrations negatively correlate with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, underlying mechanisms are unknown. Thus, there is continued interest in HDL structure and functionality. Numerous plasma factors disrupt HDL structure while inducing the release of lipid free apolipoprotein (apo) AI. Given that HDL is an unstable particle residing in a kinetic trap, we tested whether HDL could be stabilized by acylation with acetyl and hexanoyl anhydrides, giving AcHDL and HexHDL respectively. Lysine analysis with fluorescamine showed that AcHDL and HexHDL respectively contained 11 acetyl and 19 hexanoyl groups. Tests with biological and physicochemical perturbants showed that HexHDL was more stable than HDL to perturbant-induced lipid free apo AI formation. Like the reaction of streptococcal serum opacity factor against HDL, the interaction of HDL with its receptor, scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1), removes CE from HDL. Thus, we tested and validated the hypothesis that selective uptake of HexHDL-[3H]CE by Chinese Hamster Ovary cells expressing SR-B1 is less than that of HDL-[3H]CE; thus, selective SR-B1 uptake of HDL-CE depends on HDL instability. However, in mice, plasma clearance, hepatic uptake and sterol secretion into bile were faster from HexHDL-[3H]CE than from HDL-[3H]CE. Collectively, our data show that acylation increases HDL stability and that the reaction of plasma factors with HDL and SR-B1-mediated uptake are reduced by increased HDL stability. In vivo data suggest that HexHDL promotes charge-dependent reverse cholesterol transport, by a mechanism that increases hepatic sterol uptake via non SR-B1 receptors, thereby increasing bile acid output.

Regulation of the subcellular trafficking of CD36, a major determinant of cardiac fatty acid utilization,

Abstract: Myocardial uptake of long-chain fatty acids largely occurs by facilitated diffusion, involving primarily the membrane-associated protein CD36. Other putative fatty acid transporters, such as FABPpm, FATP1 and FATP4, also play a role, but their quantitative contribution is much smaller or their involvement is rather permissive. Besides its sarcolemmal localization, CD36 is also present in intracellular compartments (endosomes). CD36 cycles between both pools via vesicle-mediated trafficking, and the relative distribution between endosomes versus sarcolemma determines the rate of cardiac fatty acid uptake. A net translocation of CD36 to the sarcolemma is induced by various stimuli, in particular hormones like insulin and myocyte contractions, so as to allow a proper coordination of the rate of fatty acid uptake with rapid fluctuations in myocardial energy needs. Furthermore, changes in cardiac fatty acid utilization that occur in both acute and chronic cardiac disease appear to be accompanied by concomitant changes in the sarcolemmal presence of CD36. Studies in various animal and cell models suggest that interventions aimed at modulating the sarcolemmal presence or functioning of CD36 hold promise as therapy to rectify aberrant rates of fatty acid uptake in order to fight cardiac metabolic remodeling and restore proper contractile function. In this review we discuss our current knowledge about the role of CD36 in cardiac fatty acid uptake and metabolism in health and disease with focus on the regulation of the subcellular trafficking of CD36 and its selective modulation as therapeutic approach for cardiac disease.

Abstract: Adipogenesis is the process of differentiation of immature mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes. Elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate adipocyte differentiation is key for the development of novel therapies for the control of obesity and related comorbidities. Cytosolic group IVA phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α) is the pivotal enzyme in receptor-mediated arachidonic acid (AA) mobilization and attendant eicosanoid production. Using primary multipotent cells and cell lines predetermined to become adipocytes, we show here that cPLA2α displays a proadipogenic function that occurs very early in the adipogenic process. Interestingly, cPLA2α levels decrease during adipogenesis, but cPLA2α-deficient preadipocytes exhibit a reduced capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, which affects early and terminal adipogenic transcription factors. Additionally, the absence of the phospholipase alters proliferation and cell-cycle progression that takes place during adipogenesis. Preconditioning of preadipocytes with AA increases the adipogenic capacity of these cells. Moreover, animals deficient in cPLA2α show resistance to obesity when fed a high fat diet that parallels changes in the expression of adipogenic transcription factors of the adipose tissue. Collectively, these results show that preadipocyte cPLA2α activation is a hitherto unrecognized factor for adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: In the past decade, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of circulating levels of lipoproteins. Specifically, recent work has uncovered the role of miRNAs in controlling the levels of atherogenic low-density lipoprotein LDL (LDL)-cholesterol by post-transcriptionally regulating genes involved in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, cholesterol biosynthesis, and hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR) expression. Interestingly, several of these miRNAs are located in genomic loci associated with abnormal levels of circulating lipids in humans. These findings reinforce the interest of targeting this subset of non-coding RNAs as potential therapeutic avenues for regulating plasma cholesterol and triglyceride (TAG) levels. In this review, we will discuss how these new miRNAs represent potential pre-disposition factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and putative therapeutic targets in patients with cardiometabolic disorders.

Abstract: Pkh is the yeast ortholog of the mammalian 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). Pkh phosphorylates the activation loop of Ypks, Tpks, Sch9 and also phosphorylates the eisosome components Lsp1 and Pil1, which play fundamental roles upstream of diverse signaling pathways, including the cell wall integrity and sphingosine/long-chain base (LCB) signaling pathways. In S. cerevisiae, two isoforms, ScPkh1 and ScPkh2, are required for cell viability, while only one ortholog exists in C. albicans, CaPkh2. In spite of the extensive information gathered on the role of Pkh in the LCB signaling, the yeast Pkh kinases are not known to bind lipids and previous studies did not identify PH domains in Pkh sequences. We now describe that the C-terminal region of CaPkh2 is required for its intrinsic kinase activity. In addition, we found that the C-terminal region of CaPkh2 enables its interaction with structural and signaling lipids. Our results further show that phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol (3,4 and 4,5)-biphosphates, and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate inhibit Pkh activity, whereas sulfatide binds with high affinity but does not affect the intrinsic activity of CaPkh2. Interestingly, we identified that its human ortholog PDK1 also binds to sulfatide. We propose a mechanism by which lipids and dihydrosphingosine regulate CaPkh2 kinase activity by modulating the interaction of the C-terminal region with the kinase domain, while sulfatide-like lipids support localization CaPkh2 mediated by a C-terminal PH domain, without affecting kinase intrinsic activity.

Abstract: Cholesterol is important for various neuronal functions in the brain. Brain has elaborate regulatory mechanisms to control cholesterol metabolism that are distinct from the mechanisms in periphery. Interestingly, dysregulation of the cholesterol metabolism is strongly associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs acting as post-transcriptional gene regulators. Recently, several microRNAs are demonstrated to be involved in regulating cholesterol metabolism in the brain. This article reviews the regulatory mechanisms of cellular cholesterol homeostasis in the brain. In addition, we discuss the role of microRNAs in brain cholesterol metabolism and their potential implications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Impaired cardiac metabolism in the obese and diabetic heart leads to glucolipotoxicity and ensuing cardiomyopathy. Glucolipotoxicity causes cardiomyocyte injury by increasing energy insufficiency, impairing proteasomal-mediated protein degradation and inducing apoptosis. Proteasome-evading proteins are degraded by autophagy in the lysosome, whose metabolism and function are regulated by master regulator transcription factor EB (TFEB). Limited studies have examined the impact of glucolipotoxicity on intra-lysosomal signaling proteins and their regulators. By utilizing a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, type-1 diabetes (Akita) and ex-vivo model of glucolipotoxicity (H9C2 cells and NRCM, neonatal rat cardiomyocyte), we examined whether glucolipotoxicity negatively targets TFEB and lysosomal proteins to dysregulate autophagy and cause cardiac injury. Despite differential effects of obesity and diabetes on LC3B-II, expression of proteins facilitating autophagosomal clearance such as TFEB, LAMP-2A, Hsc70 and Hsp90 were decreased in the obese and diabetic heart. In-vivo data was recapitulated in H9C2 and NRCM cells, which exhibited impaired autophagic flux and reduced TFEB content when exposed to a glucolipotoxic milieu. Notably, overloading myocytes with a saturated fatty acid (palmitate) but not an unsaturated fatty acid (oleate) depleted cellular TFEB and suppressed autophagy, suggesting a fatty acid specific regulation of TFEB and autophagy in the cardiomyocyte. The effect of glucolipotoxicity to reduce TFEB content was also confirmed in heart tissue from patients with Class-I obesity. Therefore, during glucolipotoxicity, suppression of lysosomal autophagy was associated with reduced lysosomal content, decreased cathepsin-B activity and diminished cellular TFEB content likely rendering myocytes susceptible to cardiac injury.

Abstract: In the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum (SC), ceramides form a diverse and essential pool of lipids. Due to their diversity and the limited availability of synthetic standards it is challenging to quantitatively analyse all SC ceramides independently. We aim to perform a detailed analysis of ceramides on SC harvested from in vivo and ex vivo skin, therefore, a LC/MS method was developed in which all steps from sample acquisition until data analysis were examined and optimized. Improving extraction efficiency of ceramides resulted in an increase in efficiency from 71.5% to 99.3%. It was shown that sample harvesting by tape-stripping in vivo was accurate and precise. A full scan MS method was developed, compatible with all sample types, enabling simultaneously qualitative and quantitative data analysis. A novel three dimensional response model was constructed to quantify all detected ceramides from full scan data using a limited amount of synthetic ceramides. The application is demonstrated on various SC sample types. When ex vivo SC was regenerated during human skin culture, increases are observed in the amount of the ceramide sphingosine subclasses, in mono unsaturated ceramides (which have an cis-double bond in the acyl chain), and ceramides with a short C34 carbon chain (ceramides with a total carbon chain of 34 carbon atoms), compared with native human skin. These changes in ceramide levels are also often encountered in diseased skin.

Abstract: Listeria monocytogenes, the causative organism of the serious food-borne disease listeriosis, has a membrane abundant in branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs). BCFAs are normally biosynthesized from branched-chain amino acids via the activity of branched chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (Bkd), and disruption of this pathway results in reduced BCFA content in the membrane. Short branched-chain carboxylic acids (BCCAs) added as media supplements result in incorporation of BCFAs arising from the supplemented BCCAs in the membrane of L. monocytogenes bkd mutant MOR401. High concentrations of the supplements also effect similar changes in the membrane of the wild type organism with intact bkd. Such carboxylic acids clearly act as fatty acid precursors, and there must be an alternative pathway resulting in the formation of their CoA thioester derivatives. Candidates for this are the enzymes phosphotransbutyrylase (Ptb) and butyrate kinase (Buk), the products of the first two genes of the bkd operon. Ptb from L. monocytogenes exhibited broad substrate specificity, a strong preference for branched-chain substrates, a lack of activity with acetyl CoA and hexanoyl CoA, and strict chain length preference (C3–C5). Ptb catalysis involved ternary complex formation. Additionally, Ptb could utilize unnatural branched-chain substrates such as 2-ethylbutyryl CoA, albeit with lower efficiency, consistent with a potential involvement of this enzyme in the conversion of the carboxylic acid additives into CoA primers for BCFA biosynthesis.

Abstract: Digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) is a major component of thylakoid membranes, occupying approximately 20% of the membrane system. This lipid composition is conserved from cyanobacteria to the chloroplasts of terrestrial plants, suggesting that DGDG is important for the function of photosynthetic membranes. Here we isolated the gene for DGDG synthase in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (7942dgdA) and found that this gene is essential for this species. 7942dgdA could be knocked out only when genes for cyanobacterial or plant DGDG synthases were expressed, indicating that the important factor was not the specific synthetic pathway but the lipid product. Lack of DGDG could not be compensated by the other membrane lipids in S. elongatus PCC 7942 or by glucosylgalactosyldiacylglycerol synthesized by the β-GlcT gene of Chloroflexus aurantiacus. These results reveal that DGDG has an indispensable role in S. elongatus PCC 7942 and that the second galactose molecule is key. Conservation and distribution of the galactolipid synthetic pathway among oxygenic phototrophs is discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Plant Lipid Biology edited by Kent D. Chapman and Ivo Feussner.

Abstract: The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may reduce low-grade inflammation associated with obesity. The relationship between therapeutic response to n-3 PUFAs and modification of the transcriptome in obesity or metabolic syndrome remains to be explored. Blood samples were obtained from women with obesity before and after three-months supplementation with a moderate dose of n-3 PUFAs (1.8g EPA+DHA per day) or from controls. n-3 PUFAs (GC) and plasma concentrations of lipoxins, resolvins, protectin X (GC–MS/MS) and inflammatory markers (ELISA) were measured. Whole blood transcriptome was assayed using microarray. Women supplemented with n-3 PUFAs for 3months had significantly higher levels of EPA and DHA in plasma phosphatidylcholine. n-3 PUFA supplementation, in contrast to placebo, significantly decreased the concentrations of several inflammatory markers (SELE, MCP-1, sVCAM-1, sPECAM-1, and hsCRP), fasting triglycerides and insulin and increased the concentrations of pro-resolving DHA derivatives in plasma. The microarray data demonstrated effects of n-3 PUFAs on PPAR-α, NRF2 and NF-κB target genes. N-3 PUFAs increased DHA-derived pro-resolving mediators in women with obesity. Elevated resolvins and up-regulation of the resolvin receptor occurred in parallel with activation of PPAR-α target genes related to lipid metabolism and of NRF2 up-regulated antioxidant enzymes.

Abstract: Postmenopausal women (PMW) report marginal n−3 PUFA intakes and are at risk of chronic diseases associated with the skeletal, muscular, neuroendocrine, and cardiovascular systems. How n−3 PUFA affect the amounts of endocannabinoids (ECs) and oxylipins (OLs) of metabolic and physiologic importance in PMW is not clear. Based on our recent findings that dietary n−3 PUFA alter gene targets of the EC system and lower pro-inflammatory OL we proceeded to characterize these actions in blood of PMW. Our aim was to determine levels of the ECs, OLs, and global metabolites (GM) in white PMW (75±7y), randomized in a double-masked manner, from baseline to 6mo after receiving a fish oil supplement of n−3 PUFA (720mg 20:5n3+480mg 22:6n3/d, n=20) or placebo (1.8g oleic acid/d, n=20). ECs and OLs in serum were determined by UPLC-MS/MS and GM by GC–MS and LC-MS/MS. Plasma 20:5n3 and 22:6n3 levels increased in PMW given fish oil. EC n−6 acyl-ethanolamides, arachidonate-derived diols were decreased and 20:5n3 and 22:6n3 diols, epoxides, and alcohols were increased in PMW given fish oil. GM analysis revealed that n−3 PUFA supplementation increased renal steroid hormone and proteolytic metabolite levels in PMW. Herein, we confirm that gene targets of the EC system, previously found as modifiable by n−3 PUFA result in changes in the levels of ECs and OLs in PMW. This study shows phenotypic responses (in levels) to n−3 PUFA supplementation in PMW and increases of n−3 acyl-ethanolamide and n−3-derived OL of clinical considerations in aging.

Abstract: Linoleic acid (LA) is known to activate G-protein coupled receptors and connexin hemichannels (Cx HCs) but possible interlinks between these two responses remain unexplored. Here, we evaluated the mechanism of action of LA on the membrane permeability mediated by Cx HCs in MKN28 cells. These cells were found to express connexins, GPR40, GPR120, and CD36 receptors. The Cx HC activity of these cells increased after 5min of treatment with LA or GW9508, an agonist of GPR40/GPR120; or exposure to extracellular divalent cation-free solution (DCFS), known to increase the open probability of Cx HCs, yields an immediate increase in Cx HC activity of similar intensity and additive with LA-induced change. Treatment with a CD36 blocker or transfection with siRNA-GPR120 maintains the LA-induced Cx HC activity. However, cells transfected with siRNA-GPR40 did not show LA-induced Cx HC activity but activity was increased upon exposure to DCFS, confirming the presence of activatable Cx HCs in the cell membrane. Treatment with AKTi (Akt inhibitor) abrogated the LA-induced Cx HC activity. In HeLa cells transfected with Cx43 (HeLa-Cx43), LA induced phosphorylation of surface Cx43 at serine 373 (S373), site for Akt phosphorylation. HeLa-Cx43 but not HeLa-Cx43 cells with a S373A mutation showed a LA-induced Cx HC activity directly related to an increase in cell surface Cx43 levels. Thus, the increase in membrane permeability induced by LA is mediated by an intracellular signaling pathway activated by GPR40 that leads to an increase in membrane levels of Cx43 phosphorylated at serine 373 via Akt.

Abstract: Conjugates of fatty acids and amines, including endocannabinoids, are known to play important roles as endogenous signaling molecules. Among these, the ethanolamine conjugate of the n-3 poly unsaturated long chain fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) (DHA) was shown to possess strong anti-inflammatory properties. Previously, we identified the serotonin conjugate of DHA, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), in intestinal tissues and showed that its levels are markedly influenced by intake of n-3 PUFAs. However, its biological roles remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that DHA-5-HT possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties by attenuating the IL-23-IL-17 signaling cascade in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Transcriptome analysis revealed that DHA-5-HT down-regulates LPS-induced genes, particularly those involved in generating a CD4+ Th17 response. Hence, levels of PGE2, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-23, all pivotal macrophage-produced mediators driving the activation of pathogenic Th17 cells in a concerted way, were found to be significantly suppressed by concentrations as low as 100–500nM DHA-5-HT. Furthermore, DHA-5-HT inhibited the ability of RAW264.7 cells to migrate and downregulated chemokines like MCP-1, CCL-20, and gene-expression of CCL-22 and of several metalloproteinases. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested negative overlap with gene sets linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and positive overlap with gene sets related to the Nrf2 pathway. The specific formation of DHA-5-HT in the gut, combined with increasing data underlining the importance of the IL-23-IL-17 signaling pathway in the etiology of many chronic inflammatory diseases merits further investigation into its potential as therapeutic compound in e.g. IBD or intestinal tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is the form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease posing risk to progress into serious long term complications. Human and pre-clinical models implicate cellular cholesterol dysregulation playing important role in its development. Mouse model studies suggest synergism between dietary cholesterol and fat in contributing to NASH but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our laboratory previously reported the primary importance of hepatic endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol (ER-Chol) in regulating hepatic ER stress by comparing the responses of wild type, Ldlr−/−xLcat+/+ and Ldlr−/−xLcat−/− mice, to a 2% high cholesterol diet (HCD). Here we further investigated the roles of ER-Chol and ER stress in HFHS diet-induced NASH using the same strains. With HFHS diet feeding, both WT and Ldlr−/−xLcat+/+ accumulate ER-Chol in association with ER stress and inflammasome activation but the Ldlr−/−xLcat−/− mice are protected. By contrast, all three strains accumulate cholesterol crystal, in correlation with ER-Chol, albeit less so in Ldlr−/−xLcat−/− mice. By comparison, HCD feeding per se (i) is sufficient to promote steatosis and activate inflammasomes, and (ii) results in dramatic accumulation of cholesterol crystal which is linked to inflammasome activation in Ldlr−/−xLcat−/− mice, independent of ER-Chol. Our data suggest that both dietary fat and cholesterol each independently promote steatosis, cholesterol crystal accumulation and inflammasome activation through distinct but complementary pathways. In vitro studies using palmitate-induced hepatic steatosis in HepG2 cells confirm the key roles by cellular cholesterol in the induction of steatosis and inflammasome activations. These novel findings provide opportunities for exploring a cellular cholesterol-focused strategy for treatment of NASH.

Abstract: Resolution of inflammation is an active process involving a novel category of lipid factors known as specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, which includes Resolvin D1 (RvD1). While accumulating evidence suggests that RvD1 counteracts proinflammatory signaling and promotes resolution, the specific cellular targets and mechanisms of action of RvD1 remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role and molecular mechanisms of RvD1 in ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced sterile liver inflammation. Male C57BL/6 mice underwent 70% hepatic ischemia for 60min, followed by reperfusion. RvD1 (5, 10, and 15μg/kg, i.p.) was administered to the mice 1h before ischemia and then immediately prior to reperfusion. RvD1 attenuated IR-induced hepatocellular damage and the proinflammatory response. In purified Kupffer cells (KCs) from mice exposed to IR, the levels of M1 marker genes (Nos2a and Cd40) increased, while those of M2 marker genes (Arg1, Cd206, and Mst1r) decreased, demonstrating a proinflammatory shift. RvD1 markedly attenuated these changes. Depletion of KCs by liposome clodronate abrogated the effects of RvD1 on proinflammatory mediators and macrophage polarization. In addition, RvD1 attenuated increases in myeloperoxidase activity and Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 mRNA expression. RvD1 markedly augmented the efferocytic activity of KCs, as indicated by increases in F4/80+Gr-1+ cells in the liver. However, antagonist pretreatment or gene silencing of the RvD1 receptor, ALX/FPR2, abrogated the anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions of RvD1. These data indicate that RvD1 ameliorates IR-induced liver injury, and this protection is associated with enhancement of M2 polarization and efferocytosis via ALX/FPR2 activation.

Abstract: Plant oil biosynthesis involves a complex metabolic network with multiple subcellular compartments, parallel pathways, cycles, and pathways that have a dual function to produce essential membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Modern molecular biology techniques provide tools to alter plant oil compositions through bioengineering, however with few exceptions the final composition of triacylglycerol cannot be predicted. One reason for limited success in oilseed bioengineering is the inadequate understanding of how to control the flux of fatty acids through various fatty acid modification, and triacylglycerol assembly pathways of the lipid metabolic network. This review focuses on the mechanisms of acyl flux through the lipid metabolic network, and highlights where uncertainty resides in our understanding of seed oil biosynthesis.

Abstract: Long-chain acyl-CoA esters are important intermediates in lipid metabolism and are synthesized from fatty acids by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSL). The hematophagous insect Rhodnius prolixus, a vector of Chagas' disease, produces glycerolipids in the midgut after a blood meal, which are stored as triacylglycerol in the fat body and eggs. We identified twenty acyl-CoA synthetase genes in R. prolixus, two encoding ACSL isoforms (RhoprAcsl1 and RhoprAcsl2). RhoprAcsl1 transcripts increased in posterior midgut on the second day after feeding, and RhoprAcsl2 was highly transcribed on the tenth day. Both enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant RhoprACSL1 and RhoprACSL2 had broad pH optima (7.5–9.5 and 6.5–9.5, respectively), were inhibited by triacsin C, and were rosiglitazone-insensitive. Both showed similar apparent Km for palmitic and oleic acid (2–6μM), but different Km for arachidonic acid (0.5 and 6μM for RhoprACSL1-Flag and RhoprACSL2-Flag, respectively). The knockdown of RhoprAcsl1 did not result in noticeable phenotypes. However, RhoprACSL2 deficient insects exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in triacylglycerol content in the fat body, and 90% decrease in fatty acid β-oxidation. RhoprAcsl2 knockdown also resulted in 20% increase in lifespan, delayed digestion, 30% reduced oviposition, and 50% reduction in egg hatching. Laid eggs and hatched nymphs showed remarkable alterations in morphology. In summary, R. prolixus ACSL isoforms have distinct roles on lipid metabolism. Although RhoprACSL1 functions remain unclear, we propose that RhoprACSL2 is the main contributor for the formation of the intracellular acyl-CoA pool channeled for β-oxidation in the fat body, and is also required for normal reproduction.

Abstract: N-Acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA) is a lysosomal enzyme, hydrolyzing various bioactive N-acylethanolamines with a preference for palmitoylethanolamide. Human NAAA mRNA was previously reported to consist of multiple 3′-end splice variants. However, their tissue distributions and roles have not been examined yet. In the present study, we first identified four major splice variants (tentatively referred to as a1, a2, b2, and c2) in a human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, which were composed of exons 1–11, exons 1–10 and 12, exons 1–9 and 12, and exons 1–8 and 12, respectively. We next developed quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods to individually quantify these NAAA variants as well as collectively measure all the variants. Among various human prostate cancer cells, the total levels of NAAA mRNAs in androgen-sensitive cells like LNCaP were higher than those in androgen-insensitive cells. In all of these prostate cells and other human cells, variants a1 and b2 showed the highest and lowest expression levels, respectively, among the four variants. Interestingly, ratios of the four variants were different by cell type. Variants a1 and a2 encoded the same full-length NAAA protein, which was catalytically active, while b2 and c2 were translated to C-terminally truncated proteins. As expressed in HEK293 cells these truncated forms were detected as catalytically inactive precursor proteins, but not as mature forms. These results revealed wide distribution of multiple variants of NAAA mRNA in various human cells and suggested that the proteins from some variants are catalytically inactive.

Abstract: The PPAR-RXR complex is one of the most significant and prevalent regulatory systems, controlling lipid metabolism by gene expression. Both proteins are members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, consisting of a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a hinge and a DNA binding domain (DBD). The two proteins form a heterodimer in the nucleus. The ligand-free complex interacts with corepressor proteins and blocks the expression of the genes. With the activating ligands and coactivator segments of regulating proteins, the heterodimer becomes active and allows translation of the genes under its control. We implemented model-independent all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for clarifying the structure changes that the activating ligand and the regulatory peptides impose on the PPAR-RXR system, starting with an LBD up to the PPAR-RXR-DNA complex. The simulations were carried out first with an active state of the protein. Once the relaxed state was attained, it was transformed into the inactive-state, the resulting structure was simulated. As the complex alternates between the active-inactive conformations, most of the changes are noticed at the junction area between the two subunits, located on the surface of a long fused helical structure made of H10–H11 of the proteins. The significant differences between the states included enhanced rigidity of the inactive complex, enhancement of tight contacts. The main drive for the transformation is the relocation of the tip of H12 of the PPAR that drives the carboxylate of the C-terminal towards the junction between H10–H11 of the RXR, leading to rearrangement of the main contact zone of the proteins.

Abstract: Bayberry (Myrica pensylvanica) fruits are covered with a remarkably thick layer of crystalline wax consisting of triacylglycerol (TAG) and diacylglycerol (DAG) esterified exclusively with saturated fatty acids. As the only plant known to accumulate soluble glycerolipids as a major component of surface waxes, Bayberry represents a novel system to investigate neutral lipid biosynthesis and lipid secretion by vegetative plant cells. The assembly of Bayberry wax is distinct from conventional TAG and other surface waxes, and instead proceeds through a pathway related to cutin synthesis (Simpson and Ohlrogge, 2016). In this study, microscopic examination revealed that the fruit tissue that produces and secretes wax (Bayberry knobs) is fully developed before wax accumulates and that wax is secreted to the surface without cell disruption. Comparison of transcript expression to genetically related tissues (Bayberry leaves, M. rubra fruits), cutin-rich tomato and cherry fruit epidermis, and to oil-rich mesocarp and seeds, revealed exceptionally high expression of 13 transcripts for acyl-lipid metabolism together with down-regulation of fatty acid oxidases and desaturases. The predicted protein sequences of the most highly expressed lipid-related enzyme-encoding transcripts in Bayberry knobs are 100% identical to the sequences from Bayberry leaves, which do not produce surface DAG or TAG. Together, these results indicate that TAG biosynthesis and secretion in Bayberry is achieved by both up and down-regulation of a small subset of genes related to the biosynthesis of cutin and saturated fatty acids, and also implies that modifications in gene expression, rather than evolution of new gene functions, was the major mechanism by which Bayberry evolved its specialized lipid metabolism.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has numerous biological functions including protein synthesis, protein folding, and lipid synthesis. The CAX4 gene encodes dolichyl pyrophosphate (Dol-PP) phosphatase, which is involved in protein N-glycosylation. In cax4Δ cells, the N-glycosylation of the vacuolar carboxypeptidase (CPY) was severely affected, and expression of the ER chaperone Kar2p was elevated, which resulted in UPR activation as an adaptive response. The cax4Δ cell growth was reduced, and this could be attributed to the formation of clumped aggregates, high vesiculation of the intracellular membrane, and plasma membrane alterations were depicted using DiOC6 fluorescence. In the cax4 deletion strain, the transcription factors INO2 and INO4 were upregulated, and the negative regulator OPI1 was concomitantly down regulated, which led to the derepression of the phospholipid genes CHO2, OPI3, PSD1, and PSD2 and resulted in increased phospholipid levels. However, the TAG, SE, and LD levels were significantly reduced, and FFA, sterol, and DAG levels were increased. These findings could be attributed to the derepression of the TAG and SE lipases TGL3, TGL4, TGL5, YEH1, and YEH2 and the repression of LRO1, DGA1, ARE1, and ARE2 in cax4Δ cells. Interestingly, the overexpression of SEC59 or CAX4 in cax4Δ cells prevented the ER stress and growth defect, and restored normal level of phospholipids, neutral lipids, and LDs. The current study revealed the disruption of N-glycosylation-induced ER stress, altered lipid homeostasis accounts for pleiotropic phenotype. Thus, CAX4 regulates membrane biogenesis by coordinating lipid homeostasis with protein quality control.

Abstract: Myocardial fuel selection is a key feature of the health and function of the heart, with clear links between myocardial function and fuel selection and important impacts of fuel selection on ischemia tolerance. Radiopharmaceuticals provide uniquely valuable tools for in vivo, non-invasive assessment of these aspects of cardiac function and metabolism. Here we review the landscape of imaging probes developed to provide non-invasive assessment of myocardial fatty acid oxidation (MFAO). Also, we review the state of current knowledge that myocardial fatty acid imaging has helped establish of static and dynamic fuel selection that characterizes cardiac and cardiometabolic disease and the interplay between fuel selection and various aspects of cardiac function.

Abstract: We investigated the expression of miR-192* (miR-192-3p) in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of obese subjects and its function in cultured human adipocytes. This miRNA is a 3′ arm derived from the same pre-miRNA as miR-192 (miR-192-5p) implicated in type 2 diabetes, liver disease and cancers, and is predicted to target key genes in lipid metabolism. In morbidly obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery preceded by a very low calorie diet, miR-192* in VAT correlated negatively (r=−0.387; p=0.046) with serum triglyceride (TG) and positively with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration (r=0.396; p=0.041). In a less obese patient cohort, the miRNA correlated negatively with the body mass index (r=−0.537; p=0.026). To characterize the function of miR-192*, we overexpressed it in cultured adipocytes and analyzed the expression of adipogenic differentiation markers as well as cellular TG content. Reduced TG and expression of the adipocyte marker proteins aP2 (adipocyte protein 2) and perilipin 1 were observed. The function of miR-192* was further investigated by transcriptomic profiling of adipocytes expressing this miRNA, revealing impacts on key lipogenic genes. A number of the mRNA alterations were validated by qPCR. Western analysis confirmed a marked reduction of the lipogenic enzyme SCD (stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase-1), the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A2) and the high-density lipoprotein receptor SCARB1 (scavenger receptor B, type I). SCD and ALDH3A2 were demonstrated to be direct targets of miR-192*. To conclude, the present data identify miR-192* as a novel controller of adipocyte differentiation and lipid homeostasis.

Abstract: Mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids accounts for the majority of cardiac ATP production in the heart. Fatty acid utilization by cardiac mitochondria is controlled at the level of fatty acid uptake, lipid synthesis, mobilization and mitochondrial import and oxidation. Consequently defective mitochondrial function appears to be central to the development of heart failure. Cardiolipin is a key mitochondrial phospholipid required for the activity of the electron transport chain. In heart failure, loss of cardiolipin and tetralinoleoylcardiolipin helps to fuel the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species that are a by-product of inefficient mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III. In this vicious cycle, reactive oxygen species generate lipid peroxides and may, in turn, cause oxidation of cardiolipin catalyzed by cytochrome c leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Hence, preservation of cardiolipin and mitochondrial function may be keys to the prevention of heart failure development. In this review, we summarize cardiac energy metabolism and the important role that fatty acid uptake and metabolism play in this process and how defects in these result in heart failure. We highlight the key role that cardiolipin and sirtuins play in cardiac mitochondrial β-oxidation. In addition, we review the potential of pharmacological modulation of cardiolipin through the polyphenolic molecule resveratrol as a sirtuin-activator in attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, we provide novel experimental evidence that resveratrol treatment increases cardiolipin in isolated H9c2 cardiac myocytes and tetralinoleoylcardiolipin in the heart of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and hypothesize that this leads to improvement in mitochondrial function.

Abstract: Obesity and diabetes are major public health problems, and are linked to the development of heart failure. Emerging data highlight the importance of alterations in cardiac energy metabolism as a major contributor to cardiac dysfunction related to obesity and diabetes. Increased rates of fatty acid oxidation and decreased rates of glucose utilization are two prominent changes in cardiac energy metabolism that occur in obesity and diabetes. This metabolic profile is probably both a cause and consequence of a prominent cardiac insulin resistance, which is accompanied by a decrease in both cardiac function and efficiency, and by the accumulation of potentially toxic lipid metabolites in the heart that can further exaggerate insulin resistance and cardiac dysfunction. The high cardiac fatty acid oxidation rates seen in obesity and diabetes are attributable to several factors, including: 1) increased fatty acid supply and uptake into the cardiomyocyte, 2) increased transcription of fatty acid metabolic enzymes, 3) decreased allosteric control of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and fatty acid oxidation, and 4) increased post-translational acetylation control of various fatty acid oxidative enzymes. Emerging evidence suggests that therapeutic approaches aimed at switching the balance of cardiac energy substrate preference from fatty acid oxidation to glucose use can prevent cardiac dysfunction associated with obesity and diabetes. Modulating acetylation control of fatty acid oxidative enzymes is also a potentially attractive strategy, although presently this is limited to precursors of nicotinamide adenine or nonspecific activators of deacetylation such as resveratrol. This review will focus on the metabolic alterations in the heart that occur in obesity and diabetes, as well as on the molecular mechanisms controlling these metabolic changes.

Abstract: The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is frequently employed as model organism to explore vertebrate embryogenesis but little is known about the lipoxygenase pathway in this lower vertebrate. When we searched the zebrafish genome for lipoxygenase genes we detected seven different genes localized on four different chromosomes. Four of these genes (ALOX2, ALOX3a, ALOX3b, ALOX3c) share a high degree of sequence conservation with the human ALOX5 gene, which encodes for the key enzyme of mammalian leukotriene biosynthesis. Expression profiles of the corresponding transcripts indicated that the ALOX2 gene is high level expressed during zebrafish embryogenesis whereas transcripts originating from the other three paralog genes could not be detected. To functionally compare human ALOX5 with the putative zebrafish ortholog (zebrafish ALOX2) we cloned and expressed the zebrafish enzyme in pro- and eukaryotic expression systems and characterized it as arachidonic acid 5S-lipoxygenating enzyme, which also exhibits leukotriene synthase activity. Mutagenesis studies of the triad determinants (Phe359Trp, Ala424Ile, Asn425Met) altered the reaction specificity from 5S- to dominant 15S-lipoxygenation. The finding that zebrafish expresses a functional ALOX5 together with the observation that most other human leukotriene relevant genes have an ortholog in the zebrafish genome suggests the biological relevance of leukotriene signaling in lower vertebrates.

Abstract: G proteins are peripheral membrane proteins which interact with the inner side of the plasma membrane and form part of the signalling cascade activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Since many signalling proteins do not appear to be homogeneously distributed on the cell surface, they associate in particular membrane regions containing specific lipids. Therefore, protein–lipid interactions play a pivotal role in cell signalling. Our previous results showed that although Gαs and Gαi3 prefer different types of membrane domains they are both co-localized with the D1 receptor. In the present report we characterize the role of cholesterol and sphingolipids in the membrane localization of Gαs, Gαi3 and their heterotrimers, as well as the D1 receptor. We measured the lateral diffusion and membrane localization of investigated proteins using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) detected by lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The treatment with either methyl-β-cyclodextrin or Fumonisin B1 led to the disruption of cholesterol–sphingolipids containing domains and changed the diffusion of Gαi3 and the D1 receptor but not of Gαs. Our results imply a sequestration of Gαs into cholesterol-independent solid-like membrane domains. Gαi3 prefers cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts so it does not bind to those domains and its diffusion is reduced. In turn, the D1 receptor exists in several different membrane localizations, depending on the receptor's conformation. We conclude that the inactive G protein heterotrimers are localized in the low-density membrane phase, from where they displace upon dissociation into the membrane-anchor- and subclass-specific lipid domain.

Abstract: Lateral segregation of plasma membrane lipids is a generally accepted phenomenon. Lateral lipid microdomains of specific composition, structure and biological functions are established as a result of simultaneous action of several competing mechanisms which contribute to membrane organization. Various lines of evidence support the conclusion that among those mechanisms, the membrane potential plays significant and to some extent unique role. Above all, clear differences in the microdomain structure as revealed by fluorescence microscopy could be recognized between polarized and depolarized membranes. In addition, recent fluorescence spectroscopy experiments reported depolarization-induced changes in a membrane lipid order. In the context of earlier findings showing that plasma membranes of depolarized cells are less susceptible to detergents and the cells less sensitive to antibiotics or antimycotics treatment we discuss a model, in which membrane potential-driven re-organization of the microdomain structure contributes to maintaining membrane integrity during response to stress, pathogen attack and other challenges involving partial depolarization of the plasma membrane.

Abstract: Aim
Pancreatic lipase (triacylglycerol lipase EC 3.1.1.3) is an essential enzyme in hydrolysis of dietary fat. Dietary fat, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), regulate pancreatic lipase (PNLIP); however, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is mostly unknown. As PUFA are known to regulate expression of proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and as we identified in-silico putative PPARγ binding sites within the putative PNLIP promoter sequence, we hypothesized that PUFA regulation of PNLIP might be mediated by PPARγ.
Materials and methods
We used in silico bioinformatics tools, reporter luciferase assay, PPARγ agonists and antagonists, PPARγ overexpression in exocrine pancreas AR42J and primary cells to study PPARγ regulation of PNLIP.
Results
Using in silico bioinformatics tools we mapped PPARγ binding sites (PPRE) to the putative promoter region of PNLIP. Reporter luciferase assay in AR42J rat exocrine pancreas acinar cells transfected with various constructs of the putative PNLIP promoter showed that PNLIP transcription is significantly enhanced by PPARγ dose-dependently, reaching maximal levels with multi PPRE sites. This effect was significantly augmented in the presence of PPARγ agonists and reduced by PPARγ antagonists or mutagenesis abrogating PPRE sites. Over-expression of PPARγ significantly elevated PNLIP transcript and protein levels in AR42J cells and in primary pancreas cells. Moreover, PNLIP expression was up-regulated by PPARγ agonists (pioglitazone and 15dPGJ2) and significantly down-regulated by PPARγ antagonists in non-transfected rat exocrine pancreas AR42J cell line cells.
Conclusion
PPARγ transcriptionally regulates PNLIP gene expression. This transcript regulation resolves part of the missing link between dietary PUFA direct regulation of PNLIP.

Abstract: Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is a key enzyme in triacylglycerol (TG) biosynthesis. Here we show that genetic deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of DGAT1 in mice alters cholesterol metabolism. Cholesterol absorption, as assessed by acute cholesterol uptake, was significantly decreased in the small intestine and liver upon DGAT1 deficiency/inhibition. Ablation of DGAT1 in the intestine (I-DGAT1−/−) alone is sufficient to cause these effects. Consequences of I-DGAT1 deficiency phenocopy findings in whole-body DGAT1−/− and DGAT1 inhibitor-treated mice. We show that deficiency/inhibition of DGAT1 affects cholesterol metabolism via reduced chylomicron size and increased trans-intestinal cholesterol excretion. These effects are independent of cholesterol uptake at the apical surface of enterocytes but mediated through altered dietary fatty acid metabolism. Our findings provide insight into a novel role of DGAT1 and identify a pathway by which intestinal DGAT1 deficiency affects whole-body cholesterol homeostasis in mice. Targeting intestinal DGAT1 may represent a novel approach for treating hypercholesterolemia.

Knockdown of triglyceride synthesis does not enhance palmitate lipotoxicity or prevent oleate-mediated rescue in rat hepatocytes,

Abstract: Experiments in a variety of cell types, including hepatocytes, consistently demonstrate the acutely lipotoxic effects of saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate (PA), but not unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleate (OA). PA+OA co-treatment fully prevents PA lipotoxicity through mechanisms that are not well defined but which have been previously attributed to more efficient esterification and sequestration of PA into triglycerides (TGs) when OA is abundant. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tested by experimentally modulating the relative partitioning of PA/OA between TGs and other lipid fates in hepatocytes. In this study, we found that addition of OA to PA-treated hepatocytes enhanced TG synthesis, reduced total PA uptake and PA lipid incorporation, decreased phospholipid saturation and rescued PA-induced ER stress and lipoapoptosis. Knockdown of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), the rate-limiting step in TG synthesis, significantly reduced TG accumulation without impairing OA-mediated rescue of PA lipotoxicity. In both wild-type and DGAT-knockdown hepatocytes, OA co-treatment significantly reduced PA lipid incorporation and overall phospholipid saturation compared to PA-treated hepatocytes. These data indicate that OA's protective effects do not require increased conversion of PA into inert TGs, but instead may be due to OA's ability to compete against PA for cellular uptake and/or esterification and, thereby, normalize the composition of cellular lipids in the presence of a toxic PA load.

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 deficiency reduces lipid accumulation in the heart by activating lipolysis independently of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α,

Abstract: Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) has recently been shown to be a critical control point in the regulation of cardiac metabolism and function. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) is an important regulator of myocardial fatty acid uptake and utilization. The present study used SCD1 and PPARα double knockout (SCD1−/−/PPARα−/−) mice to test the hypothesis that PPARα is involved in metabolic changes in the heart that are caused by SCD1 downregulation/inhibition. SCD1 deficiency decreased the intracellular content of free fatty acids, triglycerides, and ceramide in the heart of SCD1−/− and SCD1−/−/PPARα−/− mice. SCD1 ablation in PPARα−/− mice decreased diacylglycerol content in cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that the reduction of fat accumulation in the heart associated with SCD1 deficiency occurs independently of the PPARα pathway. To elucidate the mechanism of the observed changes, we treated HL-1 cardiomyocytes with the SCD1 inhibitor A939572 and/or PPARα inhibitor GW6471. SCD1 inhibition decreased the level of lipogenic proteins and increased lipolysis, reflected by a decrease in the content of adipose triglyceride lipase inhibitor G0S2 and a decrease in the ratio of phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) at Ser565 to HSL (pHSL[Ser565]/HSL). PPARα inhibition alone did not affect the aforementioned protein levels. Finally, PPARα inhibition decreased the phosphorylation level of 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, indicating lower mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. In summary, SCD1 ablation/inhibition decreased cardiac lipid content independently of the action of PPARα by reducing lipogenesis and activating lipolysis. The present data suggest that SCD1 is an important component in maintaining proper cardiac lipid metabolism.

Malony-CoA inhibits the S113L variant of carnitine-palmitoyltransferase II,

Abstract: Carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPT), located both in the outer (CPT I) and inner membrane (CPT II) of mitochondria, are the key players for an efficient transport of long chain fatty acids into this cell compartment. The metabolite malonyl-CoA is known to inhibit CPT I, but not CPT II. His6-N-hCPT2 (wild type) and His6-N-hCPT2/S113L (variant) were produced recombinantly in prokaryotic host, purified and characterized according to their functional and regulatory properties. The wild type and the variant showed the same enzymatic activity and were both inhibited by malonyl-CoA and malonate in a time-dependent manner. The inhibition was, however, significantly more pronounced in the mutated enzyme. The residual activities were 40% and 5% at temperatures of 4°C and 30°C, respectively. The inhibitory effect proceeded irreversibly with no recovery after post-incubation of palmitoyl-CoA (Pal-CoA) as native substrate. A model of malonyl-CoA and malonate binding to human CPT II was suggested by docking studies to explain the action of the inhibitors regarding to the effect of the mutation on the protein conformation. Results indicated that not only CPT I, but also CPT II can be inhibited by malonyl-CoA. Thus, the complete inhibition of total CPT (i.e. CPT I and CPT II) in muscle homogenates by an established assay is not due to a lack of enzymatically active CPT II, but rather due to an abnormal regulation of the enzyme.

Abstract: The homeostasis of magnesium (Mg2+), an abundant divalent cation indispensable for many biological processes including mitochondrial functions, is underexplored. In yeast, the mitochondrial Mg2+ homeostasis is accurately controlled through the combined effects of importers, Mrs2 and Lpe10, and an exporter, Mme1. However, little is known about this Mg2+ homeostatic process in multicellular organisms. Here, we identified the first mitochondrial Mg2+ transporter in Drosophila, the orthologue of yeast Mme1, dMme1, by homologous comparison and functional complementation. dMme1 can mediate the exportation of mitochondrial Mg2+ when heterologously expressed in yeast. Altering the expression of dMme1, although only resulting in about a 10% change in mitochondrial Mg2+ levels in either direction, led to a significant survival reduction in Drosophila. Furthermore, the reduced survival resulting from dMme1 expression changes could be completely rescued by feeding the dMME1-RNAi flies Mg2+-restricted food or the dMME1-over-expressing flies the Mg2+-supplemented diet. Our studies therefore identified the first Drosophila mitochondrial Mg2+ exporter, which is involved in the precise control of mitochondrial Mg2+ homeostasis to ensure an optimal state for survival.

Abstract: High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are important endogenous inhibitors of inflammatory responses. Functional impairment of HDL might contribute to the excess mortality experienced by patients with liver disease, but the effect of cirrhosis on HDL metabolism and function remain elusive. To get an integrated measure of HDL quantity and quality, we assessed several metrics of HDL function using apolipoprotein (apo) B-depleted sera from patients with compensated cirrhosis, patients with acutely decompensated cirrhosis and healthy controls. We observed that sera of cirrhotic patients showed reduced levels of HDL-cholesterol and profoundly suppressed activities of several enzymes involved in HDL maturation and metabolism. Native gel electrophoresis analyses revealed that cirrhotic serum HDL shifts towards the larger HDL2 subclass. Proteomic assessment of isolated HDL identified several proteins, including apoA-I, apoC-III, apoE, paraoxonase 1 and acute phase serum amyloid A to be significantly altered in cirrhotic patients. With regard to function, these alterations in levels, composition and structure of HDL were strongly associated with metrics of function of apoB-depleted sera, including cholesterol efflux capability, paraoxonase activity, the ability to inhibit monocyte production of cytokines and endothelial regenerative activities. Of particular interest, cholesterol efflux capacity appeared to be strongly associated with liver disease mortality. Our findings may be clinically relevant and improve our ability to monitor cirrhotic patients at high risk.

Abstract: Challenge of the immune system with antigens induces a cascade of processes including activation of naïve T cells, induction of proliferation, differentiation into effector cells and finally contraction via apoptosis. To meet the dynamic requirements of an adequate immune response, T cells must metabolically adapt to actual situations by switching between catabolic and anabolic metabolism. In this context mitochondria are hubs of metabolic regulation. The phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) is crucial for the structural and functional integrity and, thus, the metabolism of mitochondria. The aim of this study was to verify a possible interrelationship between T cell proliferation and CL composition. For this purpose, we adjusted the proliferation of peripheral human T cells from volunteers by stimulation with different concentrations of the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), inhibition with Cyclosporin A (CsA) and exposure of cells to different free fatty acids and subsequently analysed the composition of CL by LC/MS/MS spectroscopy. All of the treatments had significant effects on CL composition. Correlation analysis of the proliferation rate and CL composition revealed that only the amount of incorporated palmitoleic acid and the content of tetralinoleoyl-CL are significantly associated with the proliferation rate. This observation is strongly suggestive of a regulatory function of these particular CL components/species in the process of T cell proliferation. As CL is crucially involved in mitochondrial function one can speculate that changes in CL composition contribute to vital mitochondria-dependent adaptations of energy metabolism in T cells during immune response.

Abstract: Lipid composition affects membrane function, cell proliferation and cell death and is changed in cancer tissues. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive cancer and this study aimed at a comprehensive characterization of hepatic and serum lipids in human HCC. Cholesteryl ester were higher in tumorous tissues (TT) compared to adjacent non-tumorous tissues (NT). Free cholesterol exerting cytotoxic effects was not changed. Phosphatidylethanolamine, -serine (PS) and -inositol but not phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) were reduced in HCC tissues. Saturated species mostly increased and polyunsaturated species were diminished in all of these phospholipids. Ceramide (Cer) was markedly reduced in HCC tissues and higher levels of sphingomyelin suggest impaired sphingomyelinase activity as one of the underlying mechanisms. Importantly, ceramide in NT increased in HCC stage T3. Ceramide released from hepatocytes attracts immune cells and a positive association of the macrophage specific receptor CD163 with NT ceramide was identified. HCC associated lipid changes did not differ in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes. Protein levels of p53 were induced in TT and negatively correlated with Cer d18:1/16:0 and PS 36:1. Of the lipid species changed in HCC tissues only TT Cer d18:1/16:0, Cer d18:1/24:1, PC 38:6 and LPC 22:6 correlated with the respective serum levels. Our study demonstrates a considerably altered hepatic lipidome in HCC tissues. Ceramide was markedly reduced in HCC tissues, and therefore, raising ceramide levels specifically in the tumor represents a reasonable therapeutic approach for the treatment of this malignancy.

Abstract: Lipids comprise the bulk of the meibomian gland secretion (meibum) which is produced by meibocytes. Complex arrays of lipogenic reactions in meibomian glands, which we collectively call meibogenesis, have not been explored on a molecular level yet. Our goals were to elucidate the possible biosynthetic pathways that underlie the generation of meibum, reveal similarities in, and differences between, lipid metabolism in meibomian glands and other organs and tissues, and integrate meibomian gland studies into the field of general metabolomics. Specifically, we have conducted detailed analyses of human and mouse specimens using genomic, immunohistochemical, and lipidomic approaches. Among equally highly expressed genes found in meibomian glands of both species were those related to fatty acid elongation, branching, desaturation, esterification, reduction of fatty acids to alcohols, and cholesterol biosynthesis. Importantly, corresponding lipid products were detected in meibum of both species using lipidomic approaches. For the first time, a cohesive, unifying biosynthetic scheme that connects genomic, lipidomic, and immunohistochemical observations is outlined and discussed.

Abstract: Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) is one of the key proteins in the process of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), and its major function is to uptake high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol from plasma into liver cells. The regulation of SR-BI expression is important for controlling serum lipid content and reducing the risks of cardiovascular diseases. Here we found that SR-BI expression was significantly increased by LDL in vivo and in vitro, and the transcription factor specific protein 1 (Sp1) plays a critical role in this process. Results from co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the activation of SR-BI was associated with Sp1-recruited protein complexes in the promoter region of SR-BI, where histone acetyltransferase p300 was recruited and histone deacetylase HDAC1 was dismissed. As a result, histone acetylation increased, leading to activation of SR-BI transcription. With further investigation, we found that LDL phosphorylated Sp1 through ERK1/2 pathway, which affected Sp1 protein complexes formation in SR-BI promoter. Using mass spectrometry and site directed mutagenesis, a new Sp1 phosphorylation site Ser702 was defined to be associated with Sp1-HDAC1 interaction and may be important in SR-BI activation, shedding light on the knowledge of delicate mechanism of hepatic HDL receptor SR-BI gene modulation by LDL.

Abstract: Plants possess effective mechanisms to quickly respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. The rapid activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes occurs early after the stimulation of plant immune-receptors. Genomes of different plant species encode multiple PLC homologs belonging to one class, PLCζ. Here we determined whether all tomato homologs encode active enzymes and whether they can generate signals that are distinct from one another. We searched the recently completed tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genome sequence and identified a total of seven PLCs. Recombinant proteins were produced for all tomato PLCs, except for SlPLC7. The purified proteins showed typical PLC activity, as different PLC substrates were hydrolysed to produce diacylglycerol. We studied SlPLC2, SlPLC4 and SlPLC5 enzymes in more detail and observed distinct requirements for Ca2+ ions and pH, for both their optimum activity and substrate preference. This indicates that each enzyme could be differentially and specifically regulated in vivo, leading to the generation of PLC homolog-specific signals in response to different stimuli. PLC overexpression and specific inhibition of PLC activity revealed that PLC is required for both specific effector- and more general “pattern”-triggered immunity. For the latter, we found that both the flagellin-triggered response and the internalization of the corresponding receptor, Flagellin Sensing 2 (FLS2) of Arabidopsis thaliana, are suppressed by inhibition of PLC activity. Altogether, our data support an important role for PLC enzymes in plant defence signalling downstream of immune receptors.

Abstract: New onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a metabolic disorder that affects 40% of patients on immunosuppressive agent (IA) treatment, such as rapamycin (also known as sirolimus). IAs negatively modulate insulin action in peripheral tissues including skeletal muscle, liver and white fat. However, the effects of IAs on insulin sensitivity and thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) have not been investigated. We have analyzed the impact of rapamycin on insulin signaling, thermogenic gene-expression and mitochondrial respiration in BAT. Treatment of brown adipocytes with rapamycin for 16h significantly decreased insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein expression and insulin-mediated protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation. Consequently, both insulin-induced glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane and glucose uptake were decreased. Early activation of the N-terminal Janus activated kinase (JNK) was also observed, thereby increasing IRS1 Ser 307 phosphorylation. These effects of rapamycin on insulin signaling in brown adipocytes were partly prevented by a JNK inhibitor. In vivo treatment of rats with rapamycin for three weeks abolished insulin-mediated Akt phosphorylation in BAT. Rapamycin also inhibited norepinephrine (NE)-induced lipolysis, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) and uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 in brown adipocytes. Importantly, basal mitochondrial respiration, proton leak and maximal respiratory capacity were significantly decreased in brown adipocytes treated with rapamycin. In conclusion, we demonstrate, for the first time the important role of brown adipocytes as target cells of rapamycin, suggesting that insulin resistance in BAT might play a major role in NODAT development.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA able to bind specific sequences on target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and thereby to post-transcriptionally modulate gene expression. Being expressed in all vertebrate cell types, miRNAs have emerged as key players in a wide array of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Over the past decade, knowledge concerning the contribution of miRNAs to human pathology has grown with an astonishing pace. In particular, a major involvement of miRNAs in atherosclerosis as a leading cause of global mortality has been supported by ample evidence from in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies. This review aims to summarize and highlight current concepts of miRNA function in the continuum of atherogenesis ranging from risk factors (i.e. dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension), to endothelial dysfunction up to the events leading to plaque rupture. Areas in need for further research and potential perspectives for translational applications will be scrutinized.

Abstract: Integrins are critical receptors in cell migration and adhesion. A number of mechanisms are known to regulate the function of integrins, including phosphorylation, conformational change, and cytoskeletal anchoring. We investigated whether native neuraminidase (Neu, or sialidase) enzymes which modify glycolipids could play a role in regulating integrin-mediated cell migration. Using a scratch assay, we found that exogenously added Neu3 and Neu4 activity altered rates of cell migration. We observed that Neu4 increased the rate of migration in two cell lines (HeLa, A549); while Neu3 only increased migration in HeLa cells. A bacterial neuraminidase was able to increase the rate of migration in HeLa, but not in A549 cells. Treatment of cells with complex gangliosides (GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b) resulted in decreased cell migration rates, while LacCer was able to increase rates of migration in both lines. Importantly, our results show that treatment of cells with inhibitors of native Neu enzymes had a dramatic effect on the rates of cell migration. The most potent compound tested targeted the human Neu4 isoenzyme, and was able to substantially reduce the rate of cell migration. We found that the lateral mobility of integrins was reduced by treatment of cells with Neu3, suggesting that Neu3 enzyme activity resulted in changes to integrin–co-receptor or integrin–cytoskeleton interactions. Finally, our results support the hypothesis that inhibitors of human Neu can be used to investigate mechanisms of cell migration and for the development of anti-adhesive therapies.

Abstract: For optimal growth of a microorganism, the pH of the culture medium should be set at an optimum value. For that reason, growth media require buffering agents. We show in this study that, when grown in a medium supplemented with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), Pseudomonas aeruginosa is able to use this organic compound to produce new phospholipids. We thus pointed out that phosphatidyltris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane as well as diphosphatidyltris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane was detected in membrane lipid extracts of bacteria grown in Tris-buffered medium. Moreover, the amounts of lysoglycerophospholipids in the lipidome of P. aeruginosa grown in Tris-buffered medium increased leading to the presence of lysophosphatidylglycerol and lysophosphatidyltris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane as well as other lysophospholipid derivatives. Finally, we investigated the effect of the presence of these exogenous phospholipids on the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to some antibiotics. We observed a decrease of the minimal inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotic families, i.e., fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, ß-lactams and polymyxins, proving the importance of the buffer choice for growth medium and its impact on the lipidome.

Two functionally distinct pools of eNOS in endothelium are facilitated by myoendothelial junction lipid composition,

Abstract: In resistance arteries, endothelial cells (EC) make contact with smooth muscle cells (SMC), forming myoendothelial junctions (MEJ). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is present in the luminal side of the EC (apical EC) and the basal side of the EC (MEJ). To test if these eNOS pools acted in sync or separately, we co-cultured ECs and SMCs, then stimulated SMCs with phenylephrine (PE). Adrenergic activation causes inositol [1,4,5] triphosphate (IP3) to move from SMC to EC through gap junctions at the MEJ. PE increases MEJ eNOS phosphorylation (eNOS-P) at S1177, but not in EC. Conversely, we used bradykinin (BK) to increase EC calcium; this increased EC eNOS-P but did not affect MEJ eNOS-P. Inhibiting gap junctions abrogated the MEJ eNOS-P after PE, but had no effect on BK eNOS-P. Differential lipid composition between apical EC and MEJ may account for the compartmentalized eNOS-P response. Indeed, DAG and phosphatidylserine are both enriched in MEJ. These lipids are cofactors for PKC activity, which was significantly increased at the MEJ after PE. Because PKC activity also relies on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium release, we used thapsigargin and xestospongin C, BAPTA, and PKC inhibitors, which caused significant decreases in MEJ eNOS-P after PE. Functionally, BK inhibited leukocyte adhesion and PE caused an increase in SMC cGMP. We hypothesize that local lipid composition of the MEJ primes PKC and eNOS-P for stimulation by PE, allowing for compartmentalized function of eNOS in the blood vessel wall.

Abstract: Viroporin p7 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) acts as an ion channel for pH equilibration to stabilize HCV particles; most studies of p7 have focused on this role. However, pH equilibration by p7 via its ion channel activity does not fully explain the importance of p7 in HCV particle production. Indeed, several researchers have suggested p7 to have an unidentified ion channel-independent function. Here, we show that p7 has a novel role as a lipid raft adhesion factor, which is independent of its ion channel activity. We found that p7 targets not only the liquid-disordered (Ld) phase, but also the negatively-charged liquid-ordered (Lo) phase that can be represented as a lipid raft. p7 clusters at the phase boundary of the neutral Ld phase and the negatively-charged Lo phase. Interestingly, p7 targeting the Lo phase facilitates membrane-to-membrane adhesion, and this activity is not inhibited by p7 ion channel inhibitors. Our results demonstrated that HCV p7 has dual roles as a viroporin and as a lipid raft adhesion factor. This ion channel-independent function of p7 might be an attractive target for development of anti-HCV compounds.

Abstract: Retinoic acid (RA) has a variety of biological effects in mammalian cells and tissues. It is well known that RA induces differentiation of human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) HL60 cells, fresh human APL cells, and clinical remission in patients with APL. Retinoylation (acylation of proteins by RA) is a possible pathway for RA action. However, an understanding of the role that retinoylation plays in the actions of RA is lacking. In the current study, several retinoylated proteins were detected in RA-treated HL60 fractions following Mono Q anion exchange chromatography and analysis using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One of the retinoylated proteins was identified as Rho-GDIβ (28kDa) by TOF-MS and co-migration with Rho-GDIβ (28kDa). Truncated Rho-GDIβ (23kDa, N∆19), a product of cleavage by caspase-3, was not retinoylated. RA covalently bound to the Thr2 residue in Rho-GDIβ (5kDa), which is the second product resulting from the cleavage of Rho-GDIβ (28kDa) by caspase-3. RA treatment increased the level of Rho-GDIβ (28kDa) and decreased the level of Rho-GDIβ (23kDa). RA did not induce caspase-3 activity or Rho-GDIβ mRNA expression. It is likely that retinoylation of Rho-GDIβ increases its metabolic stability.

Abstract: Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a delta-9 fatty acid desaturase that catalyzes the synthesis of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). SCD1 is a critical control point regulating hepatic lipid synthesis and β-oxidation. Scd1 KO mice are resistant to the development of diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Using a chronic-binge protocol of ethanol-mediated liver injury, we aimed to determine if these KO mice are also resistant to the development of alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD). Mice fed a low-fat diet (especially low in MUFA) containing 5% ethanol for 10days, followed by a single ethanol (5g/kg) gavage, developed severe liver injury manifesting as hepatic steatosis. This was associated with an increase in de novo lipogenesis and inflammation. Using this model, we show that Scd1 KO mice are resistant to the development of AFLD. Scd1 KO mice do not show accumulation of hepatic triglycerides, activation of de novo lipogenesis nor elevation of cytokines or other pro-inflammatory markers. Incubating HepG2 cells with a SCD1 inhibitor induced a similar resistance to the effect of ethanol, confirming a role for SCD1 activity in mediating ethanol-induced hepatic injury. Taken together, our study shows that SCD1 is a key player in the development of AFLD and associated deleterious effects, and suggests SCD1 inhibition as a therapeutic option for the treatment of this hepatic disease.

Abstract: N-Acylethanolamines form a class of lipid mediators and include an endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide), analgesic and anti-inflammatory palmitoylethanolamide, and appetite-suppressing oleoylethanolamide. In animal tissues, N-acylethanolamines are synthesized from N-acylated ethanolamine phospholipids directly by N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D or through multi-step pathways via N-acylethanolamine lysophospholipids. We previously reported that glycerophosphodiesterase (GDE) 4, a member of the GDE family, has lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activity hydrolyzing N-acylethanolamine lysophospholipids to N-acylethanolamines. Recently, GDE7 was shown to have lysoPLD activity toward lysophosphatidylcholine to produce lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Here, we examined the reactivity of GDE7 with N-acylethanolamine lysophospholipids as well as the requirement of divalent cations for its catalytic activity. When overexpressed in HEK293 cells, recombinant GDE7 proteins of human and mouse showed lysoPLD activity toward N-palmitoyl, N-oleoyl, and N-arachidonoyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamines and N-palmitoyl-lysoplasmenylethanolamine to generate their corresponding N-acylethanolamines and LPAs. However, GDE7 hardly hydrolyzed glycerophospho-N-palmitoylethanolamine. Overexpression of GDE7 in HEK293 cells increased endogenous levels of N-acylethanolamines and LPAs. Interestingly, GDE7 was stimulated by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ but not by millimolar concentrations of Mg2+, while GDE4 was stimulated by Mg2+ but was insensitive to Ca2+. GDE7 was widely distributed in various tissues of humans and mice with the highest levels in their kidney tissues. These results suggested that GDE7 is a novel Ca2+-dependent lysoPLD, which is involved in the generation of both N-acylethanolamines and LPAs.

Abstract: A leading hypothesis of N-acyl ethanolamine (NAE) biosynthesis, including the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide (AEA), is that it depends on hydrolysis of N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPE) by a NAPE-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). Thus, deletion of NAPE-PLD should attenuate NAE levels. Previous analyses of two different NAPE-PLD knockout (KO) strains produced contradictory data on the importance of NAPE-PLD to AEA biosynthesis. Here, we examine this hypothesis with a strain of NAPE-PLD KO mice whose lipidome is uncharacterized. Using HPLC/MS/MS, over 70 lipids, including the AEA metabolite, N-arachidonoyl glycine (NAGly), the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) and prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGF2α), and over 60 lipoamines were analyzed in 8 brain regions of KO and wild-type (WT) mice. Lipidomics analysis of this third NAPE-PLD KO strain shows a broad range of lipids that were differentially affected by lipid species and brain region. Importantly, all 6 NAEs measured were significantly reduced, though the magnitude of the effect varied by fatty acid saturation length and brain region. 2-AG levels were only impacted in the brainstem, where levels were significantly increased in KO mice. Correspondingly, levels of arachidonic acid were significantly decreased exclusively in brainstem. NAGly levels were significantly increased in 4 brain regions and levels of PGE2 increased in 6 of 8 brain regions in KO mice. These data indicate that deletion of NAPE-PLD has far broader effects on the lipidome than previously recognized. Therefore, behavioral characteristics of suppressing NAPE-PLD activity may be due to a myriad of effects on lipids and not simply due to reduced AEA biosynthesis.

Abstract: Whole body docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) synthesis from α-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3) is considered to be very low, however, the daily synthesis-secretion of DHA may be sufficient to supply the adult brain. The current study aims to assess whether whole body DHA synthesis-secretion kinetics are different when comparing plasma ALA versus eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) as the precursor. Male Long Evans rats (n=6) were fed a 2% ALA in total fat diet for eight weeks, followed by surgery to implant a catheter into each of the jugular vein and carotid artery and 3h of steady-state infusion with a known amount of 2H-ALA and 13C-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n3). Blood samples were collected at thirty-minute intervals and plasma enrichment of 2H- and 13C EPA, n−3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-3, 22:5n-3) and DHA were determined for assessment of synthesis-secretion kinetic parameters. Results indicate a 13-fold higher synthesis-secretion coefficient for DHA from EPA as compared to ALA. However, after correcting for the 6.6 fold higher endogenous plasma ALA concentration, no significant differences in daily synthesis-secretion (nmol/day) of DHA (97.6±28.2 and 172±62), DPAn-3 (853±279 and 1139±484) or EPA (1587±592 and 1628±366) were observed from plasma unesterified ALA and EPA sources, respectively. These results suggest that typical diets which are significantly higher in ALA compared to EPA yield similar daily DHA synthesis-secretion despite a significantly higher synthesis-secretion coefficient from EPA.

Abstract: Obesity and a western diet have been linked to high levels of bile acids and the development of colon cancer. Specifically, increased levels of the bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA), an established tumor promoter, has been shown to correlate with increased development of colorectal adenomas and progression to carcinoma. Herein we investigate the mechanism by which DCA leads to EGFR-MAPK activation, a candidate mechanism by which DCA may promote colorectal tumorigenesis. DCA treated colon cancer cells exhibited strong and prolonged activation of ERK1/2 when compared to EGF treatment alone. We also showed that DCA treatment prevents EGFR degradation as opposed to the canonical EGFR recycling observed with EGF treatment. Moreover, the combination of DCA and EGF treatment displayed synergistic activity, suggesting DCA activates MAPK signaling in a non-canonical manner. Further evaluation showed that DCA treatment increased intracellular calcium levels and CAMKII phosphorylation, and that blocking calcium with BAPTA-AM abrogated MAPK activation induced by DCA, but not by EGF. Finally we showed that DCA-induced CAMKII leads to MAPK activation through the recruitment of c-Src. Taken together, we demonstrated that DCA regulates MAPK activation through calcium signaling, an alternative mechanism not previously recognized in human colon cancer cells. Importantly, this mechanism allows for EGFR to escape degradation and thus achieve a constitutively active state, which may explain its tumor promoting effects.

Abstract: Long-term exposure of beta cells to saturated fatty acids impairs insulin secretion and increases apoptosis. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids protect beta-cells from the long-term negative effects of saturated fatty acids. We aimed to identify the mechanisms underlying this protective action of unsaturated fatty acids. To address the aim, insulin-secreting MIN6 cells were exposed to palmitate in the absence or presence of oleate and analyzed by using nano-LC MS/MS based proteomic approach. Important findings were validated by using alternative approaches. Proteomic analysis identified 34 proteins differentially expressed in the presence of palmitate compared to control samples. These proteins play a role in insulin processing, mitochondrial function, metabolism of biomolecules, calcium homeostasis, exocytosis, receptor signaling, ER protein folding, antioxidant activity and anti-apoptotic function. When oleate was also present during culture, expression of 15 proteins was different from the expression in the presence of palmitate alone. Most of the proteins affected by oleate are targets of the ER stress response and play a pro-survival role in beta cells such as protein folding and antioxidative defence. We conclude that restoration of pro-survival pathways of the ER stress response is a major mechanism underlying the protective effect of unsaturated fatty acids in beta-cells treated with saturated fatty acids.

Abstract: Apolipophorin III (apoLp-III), an insect homologue of human apolipoprotein E (apoE), is a widely used model protein in studies on protein–lipid interactions, and anti-Legionella activity of Galleria mellonella apoLp-III has been documented. Interestingly, exogenous choline-cultured Legionella dumoffii cells are considerably more susceptible to apoLp-III than non-supplemented bacteria. In order to explain these differences, we performed, for the first time, a detailed analysis of L. dumoffii lipids and a comparative lipidomic analysis of membranes of bacteria grown without and in the presence of exogenous choline. 31P NMR analysis of L. dumoffii phospholipids (PLs) revealed a considerable increase in the phosphatidylcholine (PC) content in bacteria cultured on choline medium and a decrease in the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content in approximately the same range. The interactions of G. mellonella apoLp-III with lipid bilayer membranes prepared from PLs extracted from non- and choline-supplemented L. dumoffii cells were examined in detail by means of attenuated total reflection- and linear dichroism-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, the kinetics of apoLp-III binding to liposomes formed from L. dumoffii PLs was analysed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy using fluorescently labelled G. mellonella apoLp-III. Our results indicated enhanced binding of apoLp-III to and deeper penetration into lipid membranes formed from PLs extracted from the choline-supplemented bacteria, i.e. characterized by an increased PC/PE ratio. This could explain, at least in part, the higher susceptibility of choline-cultured L. dumoffii to G. mellonella apoLp-III.

Abstract: Aim
Atypical angiopoietin-like 8 (ANGPTL8), also known as betatrophin, is known to regulate lipid metabolism. However, its mechanism of action remains elusive.
Methods
HepG2, 3T3-L1, and NIT-1 cells were cultured in amino acid-complete MEM or histidine-free MEM to detect ANGPTL8 expression. The three cell types were treated with or without recombinant ANGPTL8 to investigate its role in lipid metabolism. Hydrodynamic tail vein gene delivery was also used to examine the role of ANGPTL8 in mice.
Results
ANGPTL8 is significantly up-regulated in amino acid-deprived cultured cells in vitro. The activation of ANGPTL8 gene transcription was mediated through the RAS/c-RAF/MAPK signaling pathway rather than the general GCN2/ATF4 pathways. ANGPTL8 activated the ERK signal transduction pathway in hepatocytes, adipocytes, and pancreatic β-cells, up-regulating early growth response transcription factor (Egr1) and down-regulating adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL).
Conclusion
ANGPTL8 is a stress-response protein that regulates fat metabolism by suppressing ATGL expression, revealing a mechanistic connection between ANGPTL8 and lipid homeostasis in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue depots have distinct features and contribute differentially to the development of metabolic dysfunction. We show here that adipocyte differentiation in subcutaneous stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) is increased compared to visceral SVF, however this increased differentiation capacity seems not to be due to changes in the number of adipocyte precursor cells. Rather, we demonstrate that secreted heat-sensitive factors from the SVF can inhibit adipocyte differentiation and that this effect is higher in visceral than in subcutaneous SVF, suggesting that visceral SVF is a source of secreted factors that can inhibit adipocyte formation. In order to explore secreted proteins that potentially inhibit differentiation in visceral preadipocytes we analyzed the secretome of both SVFs which led to the identification of 113 secreted proteins with an overlap of 42%. Further expression analysis in both depots revealed 16 candidates that were subsequently analyzed in a differentiation screen using an adenoviral knockdown system. From this analysis we were able to identify two potential inhibitory candidates, namely decorin (Dcn) and Sparc-like 1 (Sparcl1). We could show that ablation of either candidate enhanced adipogenesis in visceral preadipocytes, while treatment of primary cultures with recombinant Sparcl1 and Dcn blocked adipogenesis in a dose dependent manner. In conclusion, our data suggests that the differences in adipogenesis between depots might be due to paracrine and autocrine feedback mechanisms which could in turn contribute to metabolic homeostasis.

Cystathionine γ lyase–hydrogen sulfide increases peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activity by sulfhydration at C139 site thereby promoting glucose uptake and lipid storage in adipocytes,

Abstract: Adipocytes express the cystathionine γ lyase (CSE)–hydrogen sulfide (H2S) system. CSE–H2S promotes adipogenesis but ameliorates adipocyte insulin resistance. We investigated the mechanism of how CSE–H2S induces these paradoxical effects. First, we confirmed that an H2S donor or CSE overexpression promoted adipocyte differentiation. Second, we found that H2S donor inhibited but CSE inhibition increased phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. H2S replacing isobutylmethylxanthine in the differentiation program induced adipocyte differentiation in part. Inhibiting PDE activity by H2S induced peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) protein and mRNA expression. Of note, H2S directly sulfhydrated PPARγ protein. Sulfhydrated PPARγ increased its nuclear accumulation, DNA binding activity and adipogenesis gene expression, thereby increasing glucose uptake and lipid storage, which were blocked by the desulfhydration reagent DTT. H2S induced PPARγ sulfhydration, which was blocked by mutation of the C139 site of PPARγ. In mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4weeks, the CSE inhibitor decreased but H2S donor increased adipocyte numbers. In obese mice fed an HFD for 13weeks, H2S treatment increased PPARγ sulfhydration in adipose tissues and attenuated insulin resistance but did not increase obesity. In conclusion, CSE–H2S increased PPARγ activity by direct sulfhydration at the C139 site, thereby changing glucose into triglyceride storage in adipocytes. CSE–H2S-mediated PPARγ activation might be a new therapeutic target for diabetes associated with obesity.

Abstract: Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LTs) cause bronchoconstriction in anaphylaxis and asthma. They are formed by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) from arachidonic acid (AA) yielding the unstable leukotriene A4 (LTA4) that is subsequently conjugated with glutathione (GSH) by LTC4 synthase (LTC4S). Cys-LT receptor antagonists and LTC4S inhibitors have been developed, but only the former have reached the market. High structural homology to related enzymes and lack of convenient test systems due to instability of added LTA4 have hampered the development of LTC4S inhibitors. We present smart cell-free and cell-based assay systems based on in situ-generated LTA4 that allow studying LTC4S activity and investigating LTC4S inhibitors. Co-incubations of microsomes from HEK293 cells expressing LTC4S with isolated 5-LOX efficiently converted exogenous AA to LTC4 (~1.3μg/200μg protein). Stimulation of HEK293 cells co-expressing 5-LOX and LTC4S with Ca2+-ionophore A23187 and 20μM AA resulted in strong LTC4 formation (~250ng/106 cells). MK-886, a well-known 5-LOX activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that also acts on LTC4S, consistently inhibited LTC4 formation in all assay types (IC50=3.1–3.5μM) and we successfully confirmed TK04a as potent LTC4S inhibitor in these assay systems (IC50=17 and 300nM, respectively). We demonstrated transcellular LTC4 biosynthesis between neutrophils or 5-LOX-expressing HEK293 cells that produce LTA4 from AA and HEK293 cells expressing LTC4S that transform LTA4 to LTC4. In conclusion, our assay approaches are advantageous as the substrate LTA4 is generated in situ and are suitable for studying enzymatic functionality of LTC4S including site-directed mutations and evaluation of LTC4S inhibitors.

Cholesterol-dependent conformational changes of P-glycoprotein are detected by the 15D3 monoclonal antibody,

Abstract: The 15D3 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) binds an uncharacterized extracellular epitope of the ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter human P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Depletion of cell plasma membrane cholesterol by using methyl-β-cyclodextrin or other chemically modified β-cyclodextrins decreased the Pgp binding affinity of 15D3 mAb. UIC2 mAb, which is known to distinguish two conformers of this ABC transporter, binds only a fraction of cell surface Pgps. UIC2 mAb non-reactive pools of Pgp can be identified with other extracellular mAbs such as 15D3. Cyclosporin A (CsA) can shift non-reactive Pgps into their UIC2-reactive conformation: a phenomenon called the “UIC2 shift”. Competition studies proposed these two mAbs share overlapping epitopes and can reveal conformational changes of Pgp that correlate (r=0.97) with the cholesterol content of cells. An apparent increase in competition of these mAbs suggested a conformational change similar to those found in the presence of CsA. However, the reason turned out not to be the UIC2-shift because cholesterol removal from the plasma membrane (PM) reduced the amount of detectable Pgps by 15D3 mAb. This study showed that 15D3 mAb bound to a conformation sensitive epitope of Pgp that was responsive to PM cholesterol levels. These conformational changes were gradual and not as great as the changes observed between the two conformers recognized by the UIC2 mAb.

Abstract: When exposed to constant low temperatures (CLTs), insects often suffer from cumulative physiological injuries that can severely compromise their fitness and survival. Yet, mortality can be considerably lowered when the cold stress period is interrupted by periodic warm interruption(s), referred to as fluctuating thermal regimes, FTRs. In this study, we have shown that FTRs strongly promoted cold tolerance of Drosophila melanogaster adults. We then assessed whether this marked phenotypic shift was associated with detectable physiological changes, such as synthesis of cryoprotectants and/or membrane remodeling. To test these hypotheses, we conducted two different time-series Omics analyzes in adult flies submitted to CLTs vs. FTRs: metabolomics (GC/MS) and lipidomics (LC/ESI/MS) targeting membrane phospholipids. We observed increasing levels in several polyhydric alcohols (arabitol, erythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol), sugars (fructose, mannose) and amino acids (serine, alanine, glutamine) in flies under CLT. Prolonged exposure to low temperature was also associated with a marked deviation of metabolic homeostasis and warm interruptions as short as 2h were sufficient to periodically return the metabolic system to functionality. Lipidomics revealed an increased relative proportion of phosphatidylethanolamines and a shortening of fatty acyl chains in flies exposed to cold, likely to compensate for the ordering effect of low temperature on membranes. We found a remarkable correspondence in the time-course of changes between the metabolic and phospholipids networks, both suggesting a fast homeostatic regeneration during warm intervals under FTRs. In consequence, we suggest that periodic opportunities to restore system-wide homeostasis contribute to promote cold tolerance under FTRs.

Abstract: Using 14C-labeled epoxiconazole as a tracer, cuticular permeability of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves was quantitatively measured in order to compare different wax and cutin mutants (wax2, cut1, cer5, att1, bdg, shn3 and shn1) to the corresponding wild types (Col-0 and Ws). Mutants were characterized by decreases or increases in wax and/or cutin amounts. Permeances [ms−1] of Arabidopsis cuticles either increased in the mutants compared to wild type or were not affected. Thus, genetic changes in wax and cutin biosynthesis in some of the investigated Arabidopsis mutants obviously impaired the coordinated cutin and wax deposition at the outer leaf epidermal cell wall. As a consequence, barrier properties of cuticles were significantly decreased. However, increasing cutin and wax amounts by genetic modifications, did not automatically lead to improved cuticular barrier properties. As an alternative approach to the radioactive transport assay, changes in chlorophyll fluorescence were monitored after foliar application of metribuzine, an herbicide inhibiting electron transport in chloroplasts. Since both, half-times of photosynthesis inhibition as well as times of complete inhibition, in fact correlated with 14C-epoxiconazole permeances, different rates of decline of photosynthetic yield between mutants and wild type must be a function of foliar uptake of the herbicide across the cuticle. Thus, monitoring changes in chlorophyll fluorescence, instead of conducting radioactive transport assays, represents an easy-to-handle and fast alternative evaluating cuticular barrier properties of different genotypes.

Abstract: Monoglyceride lipases (MGLs) are a group of α/β-hydrolases that catalyze the hydrolysis of monoglycerides (MGs) into free fatty acids and glycerol. This reaction serves different physiological functions, namely in the last step of phospholipid and triglyceride degradation, in mammalian endocannabinoid and arachidonic acid metabolism, and in detoxification processes in microbes. Previous crystal structures of MGLs from humans and bacteria revealed conformational plasticity in the cap region of this protein and gave insight into substrate binding. In this study, we present the structure of a MGL from Saccharomyces cerevisiae called Yju3p in its free form and in complex with a covalently bound substrate analog mimicking the tetrahedral intermediate of MG hydrolysis. These structures reveal a high conservation of the overall shape of the MGL cap region and also provide evidence for conformational changes in the cap of Yju3p. The complex structure reveals that, despite the high structural similarity, Yju3p seems to have an additional opening to the substrate binding pocket at a different position compared to human and bacterial MGL. Substrate specificities towards MGs with saturated and unsaturated alkyl chains of different lengths were tested and revealed highest activity towards MG containing a C18:1 fatty acid.

Abstract: We describe two new hypolipidemic patients with very low plasma triglyceride and apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels with plasma lipid profiles similar to abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) patients. In these patients, we identified two previously uncharacterized missense mutations in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) gene, R46G and D361Y, and studied their functional effects. We also characterized three missense mutations (H297Q, D384A, and G661A) reported earlier in a familial hypobetalipoproteinemia patient. R46G had no effect on MTP expression or function and supported apoB secretion. H297Q, D384A, and G661A mutants also supported apoB secretion similarly to WT MTP. Contrary to these four missense mutations, D361Y was unable to support apoB secretion. Functional analysis revealed that this mutant was unable to bind protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) or transfer lipids. The negative charge at residue 361 was critical for MTP function as D361E was able to support apoB secretion and transfer lipids. D361Y most likely disrupts the tightly packed middle α-helical region of MTP, mitigates PDI binding, abolishes lipid transfer activity, and causes ABL. On the other hand, the hypolipidemia in the other two patients was not due to MTP dysfunction. Thus, in this study of five missense mutations spread throughout MTP's three structural domains found in three hypolipidemic patients, we found that four of the mutations did not affect MTP function. Thus, novel mutations that cause severe hypolipidemia probably exist in other genes in these patients, and their recognition may identify novel proteins involved in the synthesis and/or catabolism of plasma lipoproteins.

Abstract: Microalgae have received much attention as a next-generation source of biomass energy. However, most of the fatty acids (FAs) from microalgae are multiply unsaturated; thus, the biofuels derived from them are fluid, but vulnerable to oxidation. In this study, we attempted to synthesize cyclopropane FAs in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by expressing the cfa gene for cyclopropane FA synthase from Escherichia coli with the aim of producing FAs that are fluid and stable in response to oxidization. We successfully synthesized cyclopropane FAs in Synechocystis with a yield of ~30% of total FAs. Growth of the transformants was altered, particularly at low temperatures, but photosynthesis and respiration were not significantly affected. C16:1∆9 synthesis in the desA−/desD− strain by expression of the desC2 gene for sn-2 specific ∆9 desaturase positively affected growth at low temperatures via promotion of various cellular processes, with the exceptions of photosynthesis and respiration. Estimation of the apparent activities of desaturases suggested that some acyl-lipid desaturases might recognize the lipid side chain.

Abstract: Encysted embryos (cysts) of the crustacean Artemia franciscana exhibit enormous tolerance to adverse conditions encompassing high doses of radiation, years of anoxia, desiccation and extreme salinity. So far, several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to this extremophilia, however, none were sought in the lipid profile of the cysts. Here in, we used high resolution shotgun lipidomics suited for detailed quantitation and analysis of lipids in uncharacterized biological membranes and samples and assembled the total, mitochondrial and mitoplastic lipidome of Artemia franciscana cysts. Overall, we identified and quantitated 1098 lipid species dispersed among 22 different classes and subclasses. Regarding the mitochondrial lipidome, most lipid classes exhibited little differences from those reported in other animals, however, Artemia mitochondria harboured much less phosphatidylethanolamine, plasmenylethanolamines and ceramides than mitochondria of other species, some of which by two orders of magnitude. Alternatively, Artemia mitochondria exhibited much higher levels of phosphatidylglycerols and phosphatidylserines. The identification and quantitation of the total and mitochondrial lipidome of the cysts may help in the elucidation of actionable extremophilia-affording proteins, such as the ‘late embryogenesis abundant’ proteins, which are known to interact with lipid membranes.

Abstract: Dysfunction of VAMP-associated protein (VAP) is associated with neurodegeneration, both Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. Here we summarize what is known about the intracellular interactions of VAP in humans and model organisms. VAP is a simple, small and highly conserved protein on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is the sole protein on that large organelle that acts as a receptor for cytoplasmic proteins. This may explain the extremely wide range of interacting partners of VAP, with components of many cellular pathways binding it to access the ER. Many proteins that bind VAP also target other intracellular membranes, so VAP is a component of multiple molecular bridges at membrane contact sites between the ER and other organelles. So far approximately 100 proteins have been identified in the VAP interactome (VAPome), of which a small minority have a “two phenylalanines in an acidic tract” (FFAT) motif as it was originally defined. We have analyzed the entire VAPome in humans and yeast using a simple algorithm that identifies many more FFAT-like motifs. We show that approximately 50% of the VAPome binds directly or indirectly via the VAP-FFAT interaction. We also review evidence on pathogenesis in genetic disorders of VAP, which appear to arise from reduced overall VAP levels, leading to ER stress. It is not possible to identify one single interaction that underlies disease. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: The cellular lipid landscape edited by Tim P. Levine and Anant K.
