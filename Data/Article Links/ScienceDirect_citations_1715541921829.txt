Abstract: DOG1, a Ca2+-activated Cl− channel (CaCC), was identified in 2004 to be robustly expressed in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). It was rapidly included as a tumor marker in routine diagnostics, but the functional role remained unknown. CaCCs are important regulators of normal physiological functions, but also implicated in tumorigenesis, cancer progression, metastasis, cell migration, apoptosis, proliferation and viability in several malignancies. We therefore investigated whether DOG1 plays a role in the three latter in GIST by utilizing in vitro cell model systems. Confocal microscopy identified different subcellular localizations of DOG1 in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant cells. Electrophysiological studies confirmed that DOG1-specific pharmacological agents possess potent activating and inhibiting properties. Proliferation assays showed small effects up to 72h, and flow cytometric analysis of adherent cells with 7-AAD/Annexin V detected no pharmacological effects on viable GIST cells. However, inhibition of DOG1 conveyed pro-apoptotic effects among early apoptotic imatinib-resistant cells. In conclusion, DOG1 generates Cl− currents in GIST that can be regulated pharmacologically, with small effects on cell viability and proliferation in vitro. Inhibition of DOG1 might act pro-apoptotic on some early apoptotic GIST cell populations. Further studies are warranted to fully illuminate the function of DOG1 and its potential as therapeutic target.

Abstract: Everolimus is an orally administered mTOR inhibitor. The effect, and mechanism of action, of everolimus on lung cancers with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation remain unclear. Four gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant cell lines were used in the present work. Growth inhibition was determined using the MTT assay. Transgenic mice carrying the EGFR L858R mutation were treated with everolimus (10mg/kg/day), or vehicle alone, from 5 to 20 weeks of age, and were then sacrificed. To evaluate the efficacy of everolimus in prolonging survival, everolimus (10mg/kg/day) or vehicle was administered from 5 weeks of age. The four cell lines were similarly sensitive to everolimus. Expression of phosphorylated (p) mTOR and pS6 were suppressed upon treatment with everolimus in vitro, whereas the pAKT level increased. The numbers of lung tumors with a long axis exceeding 1mm in the everolimus-treated and control groups were 1.9±0.9 and 9.4±3.2 (t-test, p<0.001), respectively. pS6 was suppressed during everolimus treatment. Although apoptosis and autophagy were not induced in everolimus-treated EGFR transgenic mice, angiogenesis was suppressed. The median survival time in the everolimus-treated group (58.0 weeks) was significantly longer than that in the control group (31.2 weeks) (logrank test, p<0.001). These findings suggest that everolimus had an indirect effect on tumor formation by inhibiting angiogenesis and might be effective to treat lung tumors induced by an activating EGFR gene mutation.

Abstract: Summary
Cornification and epidermal barrier defects are associated with a number of clinically diverse skin disorders. However, a suitable in vitro model for studying normal barrier function and barrier defects is still lacking. Here, we demonstrate the generation of human epidermal equivalents (HEEs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). HEEs are structurally similar to native epidermis, with a functional permeability barrier. We exposed a pure population of hESC/iPSC-derived keratinocytes, whose transcriptome corresponds to the gene signature of normal primary human keratinocytes (NHKs), to a sequential high-to-low humidity environment in an air/liquid interface culture. The resulting HEEs had all of the cellular strata of the human epidermis, with skin barrier properties similar to those of normal skin. Such HEEs generated from disease-specific iPSCs will be an invaluable tool not only for dissecting molecular mechanisms that lead to epidermal barrier defects but also for drug development and screening.

Abstract: Summary
Recognition of fungal pathogens by C-type lectin receptor (CLR) dectin-1 on human dendritic cells is essential for triggering protective antifungal TH1 and TH17 immune responses. We show that Fonsecaea monophora, a causative agent of chromoblastomycosis, a chronic fungal skin infection, evades these antifungal responses by engaging CLR mincle and suppressing IL-12, which drives TH1 differentiation. Dectin-1 triggering by F. monophora activates transcription factor IRF1, which is crucial for IL12A transcription via nucleosome remodeling. However, simultaneous F. monophora binding to mincle induces an E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2-dependent degradation pathway, via Syk-CARD9-mediated PKB signaling, that leads to loss of nuclear IRF1 activity, hence blocking IL12A transcription. The absence of IL-12 leads to impaired TH1 responses and promotes TH2 polarization. Notably, mincle is similarly exploited by other chromoblastomycosis-associated fungi to redirect TH responses. Thus, mincle is a fungal receptor that can suppress antifungal immunity and, as such, is a potential therapeutic target.

miR-125b/Ets1 axis regulates transdifferentiation and calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells in a high-phosphate environment,

Abstract: Objectives
Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contributes to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Accumulated evidences suggested that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to osteoblast-like cells transdifferentiation (VOT) plays a crucial role in promoting vascular calcification. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression via repression of the target mRNAs. In the present work, we sought to determine the role of miRNAs in VSMCs phenotypic transition and calcification induced by β-glycerophosphoric acid.
Approach and results
Primary cultured rat aortic VSMCs were treated with β-glycerophosphoric acid for different periods of time. In VSMCs, after β-glycerophosphoric acid treatment, the expressions of cbf β1, osteocalcin and osteopontin were significantly increased and SM-22β expression was decreased. ALP activity was induced by β-glycerophosphoric acid in a time or dose dependent manner. Calcium deposition was detected in VSMCs incubated with calcification media; then, miR-125b expression was detected by real-time RT PCR. miR-125b expression was significantly decreased in VSMCs after incubated with β-glycerophosphoric acid. Overexpression of miR-125b could inhibit β-glycerophosphoric acid-induced osteogenic markers expression and calcification of VSMCs whereas knockdown of miR-125b promoted the phenotypic transition of VSMCs and calcification. Moreover, miR-125b targeted Ets1 and regulated its protein expression in VSMCs. Downregulating Ets1 expression by its siRNA inhibited β-glycerophosphoric acid-induced the VSMCs phenotypic transition and calcification.
Conclusion
Our study suggests that down-regulation of miR-125b after β-glycerophosphoric acid treatment facilitates VSMCs transdifferentiation and calcification through targeting Ets1.

Abstract: Despite the development of chemoresistance as a major concern in prostate cancer therapy, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this report, we demonstrate that DU145-derived prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) progress slowly with more cells accumulating in the G1 phase in comparison to DU145 non-PCSCs. Consistent with the important role of the AKT pathway in promoting G1 progression, DU145 PCSCs were less sensitive to growth factor-induced activation of AKT in comparison to non-PCSCs. In response to etoposide (one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs), DU145 PCSCs survived significantly better than non-PCSCs. In addition to etoposide, PCSCs demonstrated increased resistance to docetaxel, a taxane drug that is commonly used to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer. Etoposide produced elevated levels of γH2AX and triggered a robust G2/M arrest along with a coordinated reduction of the G1 population in PCSCs compared to non-PCSCs, suggesting that elevated γH2AX plays a role in the resistance of PCSCs to etoposide-induced cytotoxicity. We have generated xenograft tumors from DU145 PCSCs and non-PCSCs. Consistent with the knowledge that PCSCs produce xenograft tumors with more advanced features, we were able to demonstrate that PCSC-derived xenograft tumors displayed higher levels of γH2AX and p-CHK1 compared to non-PCSC-produced xenograft tumors. Collectively, our research suggests that the elevation of DNA damage response contributes to PCSC-associated resistance to genotoxic reagents.

Abstract: Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) has been implicated in the regulation of DNA damage responses in stem cells with dysfunctional telomeres. However, it is unclear whether Exo1-mediated DNA maintenance pathways play a role in the maintenance of genomic stability and the self-renewal of tissue stem cells in mice with functional telomeres. Here, we analyzed the proliferative capacity of neural stem cells (NSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from Exo1−/− mice. Our study shows that Exo1 deficiency impairs the maintenance of genomic stability and proliferative capacity in NSCs but not HSCs. In line with these results, we detected a decrease in proliferation and an up-regulation of p21 expression levels in Exo1-deficient NSCs but not Exo1-deficient HSCs. Our data provide experimental evidence that Exo1 deficiency has a differential impact on the homeostasis and proliferative capacity of tissue stem cells in the brain and bone marrow, suggesting that different tissue stem cells utilize distinct mechanisms for maintaining their genomic stability. Our current study provides important insight into the role of Exo1-mediated DNA maintenance pathways in the maintenance of genomic stability and the proliferative capacity of tissue stem cells.

Abstract: AlphaII-spectrin, a basic component of the spectrin-based scaffold which organizes and stabilizes membrane microdomains in most animal cells, has been recently implicated in cell adherence and actin dynamics. Here we investigated the contribution of αΙΙ-spectrin to neuritogenesis, a highly complex cellular process which requires continuous actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cross-talk between extracellular cues and their cell surface receptors, including cell adhesion molecules. Using RNA interference-mediated gene silencing to down-regulate αΙΙ-spectrin expression in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, we observed major changes in neurite morphology and cell shape: (1) reduced mean length and a higher number of neurites per cell; occasional long neurites were thinner and displayed abnormal adhesiveness during cell migration resulting in frequent breaks; similar persisting adhesiveness and breaks were also observed in trailing edges of cell bodies; (2) irregular polygonal cell shape in parallel with loss of cortical F-actin from neuronal cell bodies; (3) reduction in protein levels of αΙ- and βΙ-spectrins, but not βΙΙ-spectrin (4) decreased global expression of adhesion molecule L1 and spectrin-binding adapter ankyrin-B, which links L1 to the plasma membrane. Remarkably, αΙΙ-spectrin depletion affected L1 – but not NCAM – cell surface expression, and L1 clustering at growth cones. This study demonstrates that αΙΙ-spectrin is implicated in normal morphology and adhesive properties of neuron cell bodies and neurites, and in cell surface expression and organization of adhesion molecule L1.

Abstract: In the adult subventricular zone (neurogenic niche), neural stem cells double-positive for two markers of subsets of neural stem cells in the adult central nervous system, glial fibrillary acidic protein and CD133, lie in proximity to fractones and to blood vessel basement membranes, which contain the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan. Here, we demonstrate that perlecan deficiency reduces the number of both GFAP/CD133-positive neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and new neurons integrating into the olfactory bulb. We also show that FGF-2 treatment induces the expression of cyclin D2 through the activation of the Akt and Erk1/2 pathways and promotes neurosphere formation in vitro. However, in the absence of perlecan, FGF-2 fails to promote neurosphere formation. These results suggest that perlecan is a component of the neurogenic niche that regulates FGF-2 signaling and acts by promoting neural stem cell self-renewal and neurogenesis.

Abstract: An elevated heat-shock protein (HSP) content protects cells and tissues, including skeletal muscles, from certain stressors. We determined if heat stress and the elevated HSP content that results is correlated with protection of contractile characteristics of isolated fast and slow skeletal muscles when contracting at elevated temperatures. To elevate muscle HSP content, one hindlimb of Sprague–Dawley rats (21–28 days old, 70–90 g) was subjected to a 15 min 42°C heat-stress. Twenty-four hours later, both extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles were removed, mounted in either 20°C or 42°C Krebs-Ringer solution, and electrically stimulated. Controls consisted of the same muscles from the contra-lateral (non-stressed) hindlimbs as well as muscles from other (unstressed) animals. Isolated muscles were twitched and brought to tetanus every 5 min for 30 min. As expected, HSP content was elevated in muscles from the heat-stressed limbs when compared with controls. Regardless of prior treatment, both EDL and soleus twitch tensions were lower at 42°C when compared with 20 °C. In addition, when incubated at 42 °C, both muscles showed a drop in twitch tension between 5 and 30 min. For tetanic tension, both muscles also showed an increase in tension between 5 and 30 min when stimulated at 20°C regardless of treatment but when stimulated at 42°C no change was observed. No protective effect of an elevated HSP content was observed for either muscle. In conclusion, although heat stress caused an elevation in HSP content, no protective effects were conferred to isolated contracting muscles.

Abstract: Summary
Polysaccharide A (PSA), the archetypical immunomodulatory molecule of the gut commensal Bacteroides fragilis, induces regulatory T cells to secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). The cellular mediators of PSA’s immunomodulatory properties are incompletely understood. In a mouse model of colitis, we find that PSA requires both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms to generate protection. Plasmacytoid DCs (PDCs) exposed to PSA do not produce proinflammatory cytokines, but instead they specifically stimulate IL-10 secretion by CD4+ T cells and efficiently mediate PSA-afforded immunoprotection. PSA induces and preferentially ligates Toll-like receptor 2 on PDCs but not on conventional DCs. Compared with other TLR2 ligands, PSA is better at enhancing PDC expression of costimulatory molecules required for protection against colitis. PDCs can thus orchestrate the beneficial immunoregulatory interaction of commensal microbial molecules, such as PSA, through both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms.

Abstract: Background
We have previously reported that β-catenin is post-translationally modified with a single O-linked attachment of β-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc). We showed that O-GlcNAc regulated β-catenin's subcellular localization and transcriptional activity.
Objective
The objectives of this investigation were to identify the putative O-GlcNAc sites of β-catenin and the relevance of identified sites in the regulation of β-catenin's localization and transcriptional activity.
Method
Missense mutations were introduced to potential O-GlcNAc sites of pEGFP-C2-N-Terminal- or pEGFP-C2-Wild Type-β-catenin by site-directed mutagenesis. We determined the levels of O-GlcNAc-β-catenin, subcellular localization, interaction with binding partners and transcriptional activity of the various constructs.
Results
Serine 23 of β-catenin was determined as a site for O-GlcNAc modification which regulated its subcellular distribution, its interactions with cellular partners and consequently its transcriptional activity.
Significance
O-GlcNAcylation of Serine 23 is a novel regulatory modification for β-catenin's subcellular localization and transcriptional activity. This study is the first report to characterize site specific regulation of β-catenin by the O-GlcNAc modification.

Abstract: Metabolic and oxidative stresses induce physiological adaptation processes, disrupting a finely tuned, coordinated network of gene expression. To better understand the interplay between the mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes, we examined how two distinct metabolic stressors alter the expression profile of human dermal fibroblasts. Primary fibroblast cultures were obtained from skin biopsies of 17 healthy subjects. Metabolic stress was evoked by growing subcultured cells in glucose deprived, galactose enriched (GAL) or lipid reduced, cholesterol deficient (RL) media, and compared to parallel-cultured fibroblasts grown in standard (STD) medium. This was followed by mRNA expression profiling and assessment of >1000 miRNAs levels across all three conditions. The miRNA expression levels were subsequently correlated to the mRNA expression profile. Metabolic stress by RL and GAL both produced significant, strongly correlated mRNA/miRNA changes. At the single gene level four miRNAs (miR-129-3p, miR-146b-5p, miR-543 and miR-550a) showed significant and comparable expression changes in both experimental conditions. These miRNAs appeared to have a significant physiological effect on the transcriptome, as nearly 10% of the predicted targets reported changes at mRNA level. The two distinct metabolic stressors induced comparable changes in the miRNome profile, suggesting a common defensive response of the fibroblasts to altered homeostasis. The differentially expressed miR-129-3p, miR-146b-5p, miR-543 and miR-550a regulated multiple genes (e.g. NGEF, NOVA1, PDE5A) with region- and age-specific transcription in the human brain, suggesting that deregulation of these miRNAs might have significant consequences on CNS function. The overall findings suggest that analysis of stress-induced responses of peripheral fibroblasts, obtained from patients with psychiatric disorders is a promising avenue for future research endeavors.

Abstract: Increasing temperatures and glacier melting at the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) are causing rapid changes in shallow coastal and shelf systems. Climate change-related rising water temperatures, enhanced ice scouring, as well as coastal sediment runoff, in combination with changing feeding conditions and microbial community composition, will affect all elements of the nearshore benthic ecosystem, a major component of which is the Antarctic soft-shelled clam Laternula elliptica. A 454-based RNA sequencing was carried out on tissues and hemocytes of L. elliptica, resulting in 42,525 contigs, of which 48 % was assigned putative functions. Changes in the expression of putative stress response genes were then investigated in hemocytes and siphon tissue of young and old animals subjected to starvation and injury experiments in order to investigate their response to sedimentation (food dilution and starvation) and iceberg scouring (injury). Analysis of antioxidant defense (Le-SOD and Le-catalase), wound repair (Le-TIMP and Le-chitinase), and stress and immune response (Le-HSP70, Le-actin, and Le-theromacin) genes revealed that most transcripts were more clearly affected by injury rather than starvation. The upregulation of these genes was particularly high in the hemocytes of young, fed individuals after acute injury. Only minor changes in expression were detected in young animals under the selected starvation conditions and in older individuals. The stress response of L. elliptica thus depends on the nature of the environmental cue and on age. This has consequences for future population predictions as the environmental changes at the WAP will differentially impact L. elliptica age classes and is bound to alter population structure.

Abstract: Contraction of 3D collagen matrices by fibroblasts frequently is used as an in vitro model of wound closure. Different iterations of the model – all conventionally referred to as “contraction” – involve different morphological patterns. During floating matrix contraction, cells initially are round without stress fibers and subsequently undergo spreading. During stressed matrix contraction, cells initially are spread with stress fibers and subsequently undergo shortening. In the current studies, we used siRNA silencing of myosin IIA (MyoIIA) and myosin IIB (MyoIIB) to test the roles of myosin II isoforms in fibroblast interactions with 3D collagen matrices and collagen matrix contraction. We found that MyoIIA but not MyoIIB was required for cellular global inward contractile force, formation of actin stress fibers, and morphogenic cell clustering. Stressed matrix contraction required MyoIIA but not MyoIIB. Either MyoIIA or MyoIIB was sufficient for floating matrix contraction (FMC) stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor. Neither MyoIIA or MyoIIB was necessary for FMC stimulated by serum. Our findings suggest that myosin II-dependent motor mechanisms for collagen translocation during extracellular matrix remodeling differ depending on cell tension and growth factor stimulation.

Abstract: Promising renal replacement therapies include the development of a bioartificial kidney using functional human kidney cell models. In this study, human conditionally immortalized proximal tubular epithelial cell (ciPTEC) lines originating from kidney tissue (ciPTEC-T1 and ciPTEC-T2) were compared to ciPTEC previously isolated from urine (ciPTEC-U). Subclones of all ciPTEC isolates formed tight cell layers on Transwell inserts as determined by transepithelial resistance, inulin diffusion, E-cadherin expression and immunocytochemisty. Extracellular matrix genes collagen I and -IV α1 were highly present in both kidney tissue derived matured cell lines (p<0.001) compared to matured ciPTEC-U, whereas matured ciPTEC-U showed a more pronounced fibronectin I and laminin 5 gene expression (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). Expression of the influx carrier Organic Cation Transporter 2 (OCT-2), and the efflux pumps P-glycoprotein (P-gp), Multidrug Resistance Protein 4 (MRP4) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) were confirmed in the three cell lines using real-time PCR and Western blotting. The activities of OCT-2 and P-gp were sensitive to specific inhibition in all models (p<0.001). The highest activity of MRP4 and BCRP was demonstrated in ciPTEC-U (p<0.05). Finally, active albumin reabsorption was highest in ciPTEC-T2 (p<0.001), while Na+-dependent phosphate reabsorption was most abundant in ciPTEC-U (p<0.01). In conclusion, ciPTEC established from human urine or kidney tissue display comparable functional PTEC specific transporters and physiological characteristics, providing ideal human tools for bioartificial kidney development.

Abstract: The abnormal activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway frequently occurs in colorectal cancer. The nuclear translocation of β-catenin activates the transcription of target genes that promote cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. The pro-inflammatory mediator leukotriene D4 (LTD4) exerts its effects through the CysLT1 receptor. We previously reported an upregulation of CysLT1R in patients with colon cancer, suggesting the importance of leukotrienes in colon cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of LTD4 on Wnt/β-catenin signaling and its effects on proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells. LTD4 stimulation led to an increase in β-catenin expression, β-catenin nuclear translocation and the subsequent transcription of MYC and CCND1. Furthermore, LTD4 significantly reduced the expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin at the plasma membrane and increased the migration and proliferation of HCT116 colon cancer cells. The effects of LTD4 can be blocked by the inhibition of CysLT1R. Furthermore, LTD4 induced the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK)-3β activity, indicating a crosstalk between the G-protein-coupled receptor CysLT1 and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In conclusion, LTD4, which can be secreted from macrophages and leukocytes in the tumor microenvironment, induces β-catenin translocation and the activation of β-catenin target genes, resulting in the increased proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells.

Abstract: Drug resistance and metastasis remain major challenges in the treatment of high-risk hepatoblastoma (HB) and require the development of alternative therapeutic strategies. Modulation of apoptosis in HB cells enhances the sensitivity of these cells towards various drugs and has been discussed to enforce treatment. We investigated the impact of apoptosis sensitisers, BH3-mimetics, on the interaction between the host and HB to reduce tumour growth and dissemination while enhancing immunity. BH3-mimetics, such as obatoclax and ABT-737, enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect of TRAIL and TNF-α resistant HB cells (HepT1 and HUH6). Tumour cell migration was inhibited by ABT-737 and more markedly by obatoclax. In an orthotopic model of HB, tumour uptake was reduced when the cells were pretreated with low concentrations of obatoclax. Only 1 of 7 mice developed HB in the liver, compared with an incidence of 0.8 in the control group. In summary, our study showed that apoptosis sensitisers had broader effects on HB cells than expected including migration and susceptibility to cytokines in addition to the known effects on drug sensitization. Sensitising HB to apoptosis may also allow resistant HB to be targeted by immune cells and prevent tumour cell dissemination.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of the functional network of transcription factors establishing and maintaining pluripotency is key for the development of biomedical applications of stem cells. Nanog plays an important role in early development and is essential to induce natural pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Inducible gain-of-function systems allowing a precise control over time and dosage of Nanog activity would be highly desirable to study its vital role in the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency at molecular level. Here we engineered a recombinant cell permeable version of Nanog by fusing it with the cell penetrating peptide TAT. Nanog-TAT can be readily expressed in and purified from E. coli and binds to a consensus Nanog DNA sequence. At cellular level it enhances proliferation and self-renewal of ESCs in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Nanog-TAT together with LIF acts synergistically as judged by enhanced clonogenicity and activation of an Oct4-promoter-driven GFP reporter gene. Furthermore Nanog-TAT, in the absence of LIF, promotes pluripotency by inhibiting endodermal specification in a Stat3-independent manner. Our results demonstrate that Nanog protein transduction is an attractive tool allowing control over dose and time of addition to the cells for studying the molecular control of pluripotency without genetic manipulation.

Tetracyclines cause cell stress-dependent ATF4 activation and mTOR inhibition,

Abstract: Tetracyclines have long been used as valuable broad-spectrum antibiotics. The high antibacterial activity of tetracyclines, combined with their good tolerability, has led to their widespread use in treating various infectious diseases. However, similar to other antibiotics, tetracyclines are also known for their adverse effects on different human tissues, including hepatic steatosis. We observed that tetracyclines, including doxycycline and minocycline, caused enhanced expression of the liver chalone inhibin βE in HepG2 cells, mediated by the cell stress-regulated transcription factor ATF4. ATF4 and its target genes ATF3, CHOP, and inhibin βE are involved in cell cycle control, cell survival, cell metabolism, and modulation of cytokine expression. Furthermore, we observed that long term tetracycline incubation also caused inhibition of the mTOR complex, a central regulator of cell metabolism, further contributing to the observed cell-cycle arrest and autophagy in doxycycline- and minocycline-treated cell lines. ATF4 activation and mTOR inhibition link two crucial regulators of the cellular stress response and cell metabolism to the effects of tetracyclines on eukaryotic cell metabolism, and may help to understand the antibiotic-independent influence of these drugs on human tissues. Since the observed effects of tetracyclines on human cells were also found to be dependent on the magnesium ion concentrations supplied, the data further indicate the importance of magnesium supplementation to reduce or prevent side effects of long term treatment with tetracyclines.

Abstract: Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive bone marrow failure (BMF) during childhood, aside from numerous congenital abnormalities. FA mouse models have been generated; however, they do not fully mimic the hematopoietic phenotype. As there is mounting evidence that the hematopoietic impairment starts already in utero, a human pluripotent stem cell model would constitute a more appropriate system to investigate the mechanisms underlying BMF in FA and its developmental basis. Using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology, we have created a knockout of FANCA in human embryonic stem cells (hESC). We introduced a selection cassette into exon 2 thereby disrupting the FANCA coding sequence and found that whereas mono-allelically targeted cells retain an unaltered proliferation potential, disruption of the second allele causes a severe growth disadvantage. As a result, heterogeneous cultures arise due to the presence of cells still carrying an unaffected FANCA allele, quickly outgrowing the knockout cells. When pure cultures of FANCA knockout hESC are pursued either through selection or single cell cloning, this rapidly results in growth arrest and such cultures cannot be maintained. These data highlight the importance of a functional FA pathway at the pluripotent stem cell stage.

Abstract: Interaction between tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts plays essential roles in tumor progression. However, its detailed molecular mechanism remains unclear. To understand the mechanism, we investigated molecules mediating this interaction using the three-dimensional (3D) co-culture system of Panc-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells with normal fibroblasts. When the two kinds of cells were placed on the top of collagen gel, the tumor cells scattered into the fibroblast layer, apparently undergoing epithelial‐mesenchymal transition. When fibroblasts were placed within collagen gel, Panc-1 cells actively invaded into the collagen gel, extending a microtubule-based long protrusion. Although transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) individually stimulated the tumor cell invasion into collagen gel without fibroblasts, TGF-β signaling inhibitors (SB431542 and LY2157299) significantly enhanced the Panc-1 cell invasion in the 3D co-culture with fibroblasts. Experiments with HGF/Met signaling inhibitors or with the fibroblast conditioned medium revealed that HGF was a major invasion-promoting factor secreted from fibroblasts and SB431542 increased the HGF secretion by blocking the HGF-suppressing activity of cancer cell-derived TGF-β. These results indicate that HGF and TGF-β are critical regulators for both tumor–stroma interaction and tumor invasion. The results also suggest that TGF-β signaling inhibitors may promote tumor progression under some pathological conditions.

Abstract: The successful commercialisation of any new technology is inherently dependent on its ability to compete head-to-head with incumbent product. In pursuit of price parity, the fuel cell industry has historically focused on reducing unit cost, increasing durability and longevity, and volume production. While these are all important, many fuel cell developers have yet to address the exorbitant costs and time-consuming processes required to develop new applications which ultimately encumber profitability, sway allocation decisions, and influence which markets to pursue. This article outlines a radical approach that can dramatically lower the total cost burden of product development, as well as reduce fuel cell unit cost and improve longevity and durability, enabling a more economical path to fuel cell product commercialisation.

Abstract: Summary
In this article, we show that mouse embryonic stem cell- or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 3D retinal tissue developed a structured outer nuclear layer (ONL) with complete inner and outer segments even in an advanced retinal degeneration model (rd1) that lacked ONL. We also observed host-graft synaptic connections by immunohistochemistry. This study provides a “proof of concept” for retinal sheet transplantation therapy for advanced retinal degenerative diseases.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 32 (HSP32) is a stress response protein that can be induced by heat stress in the liver, and its induction can act as an important cellular defence mechanism against heat-induced liver injury. To investigate the functional role of HSP32 in protecting liver tissue against heat stress in mice and the mechanism by which it achieves this protective effect, HSP32 expression and carbon monoxide (CO) contents in a model of mice subjected to acute, transient heat exposure were examined. Furthermore, functional and histological parameters of liver damage and the possible involvement of oxidative stress to induce oxidative deterioration of liver functions and caspase-3 expression were also investigated in this study. We found that heat treatment of mice produced severe hepatic injury, whereas upregulation of HSP32 with hemin pretreatment prevented mice from liver damage. In contrast, addition of Sn-protoporphyrin (SnPP) to inhibit HSP32 expression completely reversed its hepatoprotective effect. It is concluded that upregulation of HSP32 by hemin could alleviate acute heat-induced hepatocellular damage in mice, and its by-product CO seems to play a more important role in hepatoprotective mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can result in viral chronicity or clearance. Although host genetics and particularly genetic variation in the interferon lambda (IFNL) locus are associated with spontaneous HCV clearance and treatment success, the mechanisms guiding these clinical outcomes remain unknown. Using a laser capture microdissection-driven unbiased systems virology approach, we isolated and transcriptionally profiled HCV-infected and adjacent primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) approaching single-cell resolution. An innate antiviral immune signature dominated the transcriptional response but differed in magnitude and diversity between HCV-infected and adjacent cells. Molecular signatures associated with more effective antiviral control were determined by comparing donors with high and low infection frequencies. Cells from donors with clinically unfavorable IFNL genotypes were infected at a greater frequency and exhibited dampened antiviral and cell death responses. These data suggest that early virus-host interactions, particularly host genetics and induction of innate immunity, critically determine the outcome of HCV infection.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a frequent clinical picture characterised by hepatic inflammation, lipid accumulation and fibrosis. When untreated, NASH bears a high risk of developing liver cirrhosis and consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma requiring liver transplantation in its end-stage. However, donor organ scarcity has prompted the search for alternatives, of which hepatocyte or stem cell-derived hepatocyte transplantation are regarded auspicious options of treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are able to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells and thus may represent an alternative cell source to primary hepatocytes. In addition these cells feature anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative characteristics, which might favour liver recovery from NASH. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefit of hepatocyte-like cells derived from human bone marrow MSC in a mouse model of diet-induced NASH. Seven days post-transplant, human hepatocyte-like cells were found in the mouse liver parenchyma. Triglyceride depositions were lowered in the liver but restored to normal in the blood. Hepatic inflammation was attenuated as verified by decreased expression of the acute phase protein serum amyloid A, inflammation-associated markers (e.g. lipocalin 2), as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα. Moreover, the proliferation of host hepatocytes that indicate the regenerative capacity in livers receiving cell transplants was enhanced. Transplantation of MSC-derived human hepatocyte-like cells corrects NASH in mice by restoring triglyceride depositions, reducing inflammation and augmenting the regenerative capacity of the liver.

Abstract: Summary
Using time-lapse imaging, we have identified a series of bottlenecks that restrict growth of early-passage human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and that are relieved by karyotypically abnormal variants that are selected by prolonged culture. Only a minority of karyotypically normal cells divided after plating, and these were mainly cells in the later stages of cell cycle at the time of plating. Furthermore, the daughter cells showed a continued pattern of cell death after division, so that few formed long-term proliferating colonies. These colony-forming cells showed distinct patterns of cell movement. Increasing cell density enhanced cell movement facilitating cell:cell contact, which resulted in increased proportion of dividing cells and improved survival postplating of normal hESCs. In contrast, most of the karyotypically abnormal cells reentered the cell cycle on plating and gave rise to healthy progeny, without the need for cell:cell contacts and independent of their motility patterns.

Abstract: The mechanisms controlling the switch between the pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory states of endothelial cells are still poorly understood. In this paper, we show that: (a) COX-2 expression induced by VEGF-A is NFAT2-dependent; and (b) the integrin profile in endothelial cells induced by the pro-angiogenic VEGF-A is distinct from that brought on by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Two groups of integrin subunits specifically upregulated over time by both cytokines were identified using RT-PCR and Western Immunoblotting. The first group included α4, α5, α6, and β5 subunits that were upregulated by VEGF-A; the second group consisted of αV and β3 induced by TNF-α. Both cytokines significantly enhanced the expression of β1 and modulated α2 mRNA. In contrast to TNF-α, VEGF-A induction of integrin subunits depended on the activation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. Both calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporineA and 11R-VIVIT) and downregulation of NFAT2 with specific siRNA decreased induction of integrin subunits. This process of induction could be increased by upregulation of NFAT2 by pBJ5-NFAT2 transfection. This suggests that NFAT2 mediates VEGF-induced upregulation of integrin subunit synthesis by providing a constant supply of newly synthesized “refreshed” mature integrin receptors, particularly α2β1, α5β1, α4β1, α6β1 and αVβ5, which are involved at different stages of angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Yersinia pestis is an arthropod-borne bacterial pathogen that evolved recently from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, an enteric pathogen transmitted via the fecal-oral route. This radical ecological transition can be attributed to a few discrete genetic changes from a still-extant recent ancestor, thus providing a tractable case study in pathogen evolution and emergence. Here, we determined the genetic and mechanistic basis of the evolutionary adaptation of Y. pestis to flea-borne transmission. Remarkably, only four minor changes in the bacterial progenitor, representing one gene gain and three gene losses, enabled transmission by flea vectors. All three loss-of-function mutations enhanced cyclic-di-GMP-mediated bacterial biofilm formation in the flea foregut, which greatly increased transmissibility. Our results suggest a step-wise evolutionary model in which Y. pestis emerged as a flea-borne clone, with each genetic change incrementally reinforcing the transmission cycle. The model conforms well to the ecological theory of adaptive radiation.

Abstract: Normal thyrocytes grown as reconstituted follicles in collagen gel were evaluated for drug effects of small molecule kinase inhibitors on growth factor-induced cell migration in a 3D context. MEK inhibition by U0126 only partially antagonized EGF/serum-induced cell migration from the basal follicular surface into the matrix. Combined treatment with U0126 and LY294002, a PI3K blocker, was necessary to abolish migration. However, exposure to only LY294002 facilitated the response to EGF by breakdown of the original follicular structure. In the same time EGF promoted thyroid cell survival that was compromised by LY294002 in absence of EGF. Cells treated with EGF and LY294002 retained the ability to form follicles. The findings indicate that dual inhibition of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways is required to fully block matrix invasion of EGF-stimulated thyroid cells. Conversely, single drug treatment with PI3K inhibitor adversely promotes invasiveness probably by destabilizing the follicular epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
The availability of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offers the opportunity to generate lineage-specific cells to investigate mechanisms of human diseases specific to brain regions. Here, we report a differentiation paradigm for hPSCs that enriches for hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) granule neurons. This differentiation paradigm recapitulates the expression patterns of key developmental genes during hippocampal neurogenesis, exhibits characteristics of neuronal network maturation, and produces PROX1+ neurons that functionally integrate into the DG. Because hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in schizophrenia (SCZD), we applied our protocol to SCZD patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We found deficits in the generation of DG granule neurons from SCZD hiPSC-derived hippocampal NPCs with lowered levels of NEUROD1, PROX1, and TBR1, reduced neuronal activity, and reduced levels of spontaneous neurotransmitter release. Our approach offers important insights into the neurodevelopmental aspects of SCZD and may be a promising tool for drug screening and personalized medicine.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is characterized by aggressive local invasion and early metastasis formation. Active migration of the pancreatic cancer cells is essential for these processes. We have shown previously that the pancreatic cancer cells lines CFPAC1 and IMIM-PC2 show high migratory activity, and we have investigated herein the reason for this observation. Cell migration was assessed using a three-dimensional, collagen-based assay and computer-assisted cell tracking. The expression of receptor tyrosine kinases was determined by flow-cytometry and cytokine release was measured by an enzyme-linked immunoassay. Receptor function was blocked by antibodies or pharmacological enzyme inhibitors. Both cells lines express the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as well as its family-member ErbB2 and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)α, whereas only weak expression was detected for ErbB3 and no expression of PDGFRβ. Pharmacological inhibition of the EGFR or ErbB2 significantly reduced the migratory activity in both cell lines, as did an anti-EGFR antibody. Interestingly, combination of the latter with an anti-PDGFR antibody led to an even more pronounced reduction. Both cell lines release detectable amounts of EGF. Thus, the high migratory activity of the investigated pancreatic cancer cell lines is due to autocrine EGFR activation and possibly of other receptor tyrosine kinases.

Abstract: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor which controls the expression of various genes involved in immune responses. However, it is not clear whether NF-κB activation is critical for phagocytosis when Staphylococcus aureus is the pathogen. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we investigated whether NF-κB cascade genes are altered in a mouse leukemic monocyte macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) when the cells were stimulated to activate a host innate immune response against live S. aureus or heat-inactivated S. aureus (HISA). NF-κB cascade genes such as Nfκb1, Nfκbiz, Nfκbie, Rel, Traf1 and Tnfaip3 were up-regulated by all treatments at one hour after incubation. NF-κB play an important role in activating phagocytosis in RAW 264.7 cells infected with S. aureus. Inhibition of NF-κB significantly blocked phagocytosis of fluorescently labeled S. aureus and decreased the expression of NFκB1, IL1α, IL1β and TLR2 in this cell line. Our results demonstrate that S. aureus may activate the NF-κB pathway and that NF-κB activation is required for phagocytosis of S. aureus by macrophages.

Abstract: An altered metabolism during ovarian cancer progression allows for increased macromolecular synthesis and unrestrained growth. However, the metabolic phenotype of cancer stem or tumor-initiating cells, small tumor cell populations that are able to recapitulate the original tumor, has not been well characterized. In the present study, we compared the metabolic phenotype of the stem cell enriched cell variant, MOSE-LFFLv (TIC), derived from mouse ovarian surface epithelial (MOSE) cells, to their parental (MOSE-L) and benign precursor (MOSE-E) cells. TICs exhibit a decrease in glucose and fatty acid oxidation with a concomitant increase in lactate secretion. In contrast to MOSE-L cells, TICs can increase their rate of glycolysis to overcome the inhibition of ATP synthase by oligomycin and can increase their oxygen consumption rate to maintain proton motive force when uncoupled, similar to the benign MOSE-E cells. TICs have an increased survival rate under limiting conditions as well as an increased survival rate when treated with AICAR, but exhibit a higher sensitivity to metformin than MOSE-E and MOSE-L cells. Together, our data show that TICs have a distinct metabolic profile that may render them flexible to adapt to the specific conditions of their microenvironment. By better understanding their metabolic phenotype and external environmental conditions that support their survival, treatment interventions can be designed to extend current therapy regimens to eradicate TICs.

Abstract: Posttranslational histone modifications are essential features in epigenetic regulatory networks. One of these modifications has remained largely understudied: regulated histone proteolysis. In analogy to the histone H3 clipping during early mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation, we report for the first time that also in human embryonic stem cells this phenomenon takes place in the two different analyzed cell lines. Employing complementary techniques, different cleavage sites could be identified, namely A21, R26 and residue 31. The enzyme responsible for this cleavage is found to be a serine protease. The formation of cleaved H3 follows a considerably variable pattern, depending on the timeframe, culture conditions and culture media applied. Contrary to earlier findings on H3 clipping, our results disconnect the link between declining Oct4 expression and H3 cleavage.

High levels of the type III inorganic phosphate transporter PiT1 (SLC20A1) can confer faster cell adhesion,

Abstract: The inorganic phosphate transporter PiT1 (SLC20A1) is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. We recently showed that overexpression of human PiT1 was sufficient to increase proliferation of two strict density-inhibited cell lines, murine fibroblastic NIH3T3 and pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, and allowed the cultures to grow to higher cell densities. In addition, upon transformation NIH3T3 cells showed increased ability to form colonies in soft agar. The cellular regulation of PiT1 expression supports that cells utilize the PiT1 levels to control proliferation, with non-proliferating cells showing the lowest PiT1 mRNA levels. The mechanism behind the role of PiT1 in increased cell proliferation is not known. We, however, found that compared to control cells, cultures of NIH3T3 cells overexpressing PiT1 upon seeding showed increased cell number after 24h and had shifted more cells from G0/G1 to S+G2/M within 12h, suggesting that an early event may play a role. We here show that expression of human PiT1 in NIH3T3 cells led to faster cell adhesion; this effect was not cell type specific in that it was also observed when expressing human PiT1 in MC3T3-E1 cells. We also show for NIH3T3 that PiT1 overexpression led to faster cell spreading. The final total numbers of attached cells did, however, not differ between cultures of PiT1 overexpressing cells and control cells of neither cell type. We suggest that the PiT1-mediated fast adhesion potentials allow the cells to go faster out of G0/G1 and thereby contribute to their proliferative advantage within the first 24h after seeding.

Abstract: To study epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) resistance mechanisms, we established a novel gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cell line derived from an EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer cell line (PC-9) pretreated with 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (designated PC9-GR). We found that gefitinib substantially suppressed the EGFR signaling pathway, whereas ERK was reactivated after several hours in PC9-GR but not in PC-9. The combination of gefitinib with ERK inhibition (by U0126) restored gefitinib susceptibility in PC9-GR, but PI3K-Akt inhibition with LY294002 did not. Although the levels of phosphorylated Src were up-regulated simultaneously with ERK reactivation, neither ERK suppression using U0126 nor an ERK-specific siRNA induced Src phosphorylation. Furthermore, dual inhibition of EGFR and Src restored gefitinib sensitivity in PC9-GR in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our results indicate that Src-mediated ERK reactivation may play a role in a novel gefitinib resistance mechanism, and that the combined use of gefitinib with a Src inhibitor may be a potent strategy to overcome this resistance.

Abstract: An essential step for therapeutic and research applications of stem cells is their ability to differentiate into specific cell types. Neuronal cells are of great interest for medical treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic injuries of central nervous system (CNS), but efforts to produce these cells have been met with only modest success. In an attempt of finding new approaches, atmospheric-pressure room-temperature microplasma jets (MPJs) are shown to effectively direct in vitro differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) predominantly into neuronal lineage. Murine neural stem cells (C17.2-NSCs) treated with MPJs exhibit rapid proliferation and differentiation with longer neurites and cell bodies eventually forming neuronal networks. MPJs regulate ~75% of NSCs to differentiate into neurons, which is a higher efficiency compared to common protein- and growth factors-based differentiation. NSCs exposure to quantized and transient (~150ns) micro-plasma bullets up-regulates expression of different cell lineage markers as β-Tubulin III (for neurons) and O4 (for oligodendrocytes), while the expression of GFAP (for astrocytes) remains unchanged, as evidenced by quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy and Western Blot assay. It is shown that the plasma-increased nitric oxide (NO) production is a factor in the fate choice and differentiation of NSCs followed by axonal growth. The differentiated NSC cells matured and produced mostly cholinergic and motor neuronal progeny. It is also demonstrated that exposure of primary rat NSCs to the microplasma leads to quite similar differentiation effects. This suggests that the observed effect may potentially be generic and applicable to other types of neural progenitor cells. The application of this new in vitro strategy to selectively differentiate NSCs into neurons represents a step towards reproducible and efficient production of the desired NSC derivatives.

Abstract: In this study, we examined the role(s) of syndecan-4 in regulating the formation of an actin geodesic dome structure called a cross-linked actin network (CLAN) in which syndecan-4 has previously been localized. CLANs have been described in several different cell types, but they have been most widely studied in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells where they may play a key role in controlling intraocular pressure by regulating aqueous humor outflow from the eye. In this study we show that a loss of cell surface synedcan-4 significantly reduces CLAN formation in HTM cells. Analysis of HTM cultures treated with or without dexamethasone shows that laminin 5 deposition within the extracellular matrix is increased by glucocorticoid treatment and that a laminin 5-derived, syndecan-4-binding peptide (PEP75), induces CLAN formation in TM cells. This PEP75-induced CLAN formation was inhibited by heparin and the broad spectrum PKC inhibitor Ro-31–7549. In contrast, the more specific PKCα inhibitor Gö 6976 had no effect, thus excluding PKCα as a downstream effector of syndecan-4 signaling. Analysis of PKC isozyme expression showed that HTM cells also expressed both PKCγ and PKCε. Cells treated with a PKCε agonist formed CLANs while a PKCα⧸γ agonist had no effect. These data suggest that syndecan-4 is essential for CLAN formation in HTM cells and that a novel PKCε-mediated signaling pathway can regulate formation of this unique actin structure.

Abstract: Summary
Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a leading cause of infection-related mortality in humans. All GAS serotypes express the Lancefield group A carbohydrate (GAC), comprising a polyrhamnose backbone with an immunodominant N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) side chain, which is the basis of rapid diagnostic tests. No biological function has been attributed to this conserved antigen. Here we identify and characterize the GAC biosynthesis genes, gacA through gacL. An isogenic mutant of the glycosyltransferase gacI, which is defective for GlcNAc side-chain addition, is attenuated for virulence in two infection models, in association with increased sensitivity to neutrophil killing, platelet-derived antimicrobials in serum, and the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL-37. Antibodies to GAC lacking the GlcNAc side chain and containing only polyrhamnose promoted opsonophagocytic killing of multiple GAS serotypes and protected against systemic GAS challenge after passive immunization. Thus, the Lancefield antigen plays a functional role in GAS pathogenesis, and a deeper understanding of this unique polysaccharide has implications for vaccine development.

Abstract: Summary
The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a widespread molecular weapon deployed by many Proteobacteria to target effectors/toxins into both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. We report that Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil bacterium that triggers tumorigenesis in plants, produces a family of type VI DNase effectors (Tde) that are distinct from previously known polymorphic toxins and nucleases. Tde exhibits an antibacterial DNase activity that relies on a conserved HxxD motif and can be counteracted by a cognate immunity protein, Tdi. In vitro, A. tumefaciens T6SS could kill Escherichia coli but triggered a lethal counterattack by Pseudomonas aeruginosa upon injection of the Tde toxins. However, in an in planta coinfection assay, A. tumefaciens used Tde effectors to attack both siblings cells and P. aeruginosa to ultimately gain a competitive advantage. Such acquired T6SS-dependent fitness in vivo and conservation of Tde-Tdi couples in bacteria highlights a widespread antibacterial weapon beneficial for niche colonization.

Abstract: The muscle-specific variant of neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS-I), is developmentally regulated in mouse suggesting a role of NO during myogenesis. In chick embryo, a good model of development, we found that the expression of NOS-I is up-regulated, but only in the early phase of development. Through a pharmacological intervention in ovo we found that NO signalling plays a relevant role during embryonic development. The inhibition of NOS-I decreased the growth of embryo, in particular of muscle tissue, while the restoring of physiological NO levels, via administration of a NO donor, reversed this effect. We found a selective action of NO, produced by NOS-I, on regulatory factors involved in myogenic differentiation in the early phase of chick embryo development: inhibition of NO generation leads to a decreased expression of the Myocyte enhancer factor 2a (Mef2a), Mef2c, Myogenin and Myosin, which was reversed by the administration of a NO donor. NO had no effects on Myf5 and MyoD, the myogenic regulatory factors necessary for myogenic determination. The action of NO on the myogenic regulatory factors was mediated via generation of cyclic GMP (cGMP) and activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG). Finally we found in myoblasts in vitro that the activation of Mef2c was the key event mediating the NO-induced modulation of myogenesis. Our results identify NO produced by NOS-I as a key messenger in the early phase of embryonic development of chicken, acting as a critical determinant of myogenesis through its physiological cGMP/PKG pathway.

Abstract: 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) is involved in organelle homeostasis by degrading mitochondria in maturing red blood cells and by eliminating excess peroxisomes in liver. Furthermore, 12/15-LOX contributes to diseases by exacerbating oxidative stress-related injury, notably in stroke. Nonetheless, it is unclear what the consequences are of abolishing 12/15-LOX activity. Mice in which the alox15 gene has been ablated do not show an obvious phenotype, and LOX enzyme inhibition is not overtly detrimental. We show here that liver histology is also unremarkable. However, electron microscopy demonstrated that 12/15-LOX knockout surprisingly leads to increased macroautophagy in the liver. Not only macroautophagy but also mitophagy and pexophagy were increased in hepatocytes, which otherwise showed unaltered fine structure and organelle morphology. These findings were substantiated by immunofluorescence showing significantly increased number of LC3 puncta and by Western blotting demonstrating a significant increase for LC3-II protein in both liver and brain homogenates of 12/15-LOX knockout mice. Inhibition of 12/15-LOX activity by treatment with four structurally different inhibitors had similar effects in cultured HepG2 hepatoma cells and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with significantly increased autophagy discernable already after 2 hours. Hence, our study reveals a link between ablation or inhibition of 12/15-LOX and stimulation of macroautophagy. The enhanced macroautophagy may be related to the known tissue-protective effects of LOX ablation or inhibition under various diseased conditions caused by oxidative stress and ischemia. This could provide an important cleaning mechanism of cells and tissues to prevent accumulation of damaged mitochondria and other cellular components.

Abstract: Naturally occurring pterostilbene (PTER) and isothiocyanate (ITC) attract great attention due to their wide range of biological properties, including anti-cancer, anti-leukemic, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. A novel class of hybrid compound synthesized by introducing an ITC moiety on PTER backbone was evaluated for its anti-cancer efficacy in hormone-dependent breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) in vitro and Ehrlich ascitic tumor bearing mice model in vivo. The novel hybrid molecule showed significant in vitro anti-cancer activity (IC50=25±0.38) when compared to reference compound PTER (IC50=65±0.42). The conjugate molecule induced both S and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest as indicated by flow cytometry analysis. In addition, the conjugate induced cell death was characterized by changes in cell morphology, DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase-9, release of cytochrome-c into cytosol and increased Bax: Bcl-2 ratio. The conjugate also suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK. The conjugate induced cell death was significantly increased in presence of A6730 (a potent Akt1/2 kinase inhibitor) and PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor). Moreover, the conjugated PTER inhibited tumor growth in Ehrlich ascitic cell induced tumor bearing mice as observed by reduction in tumor volume compared to untreated animals. Collectively, the pro-apoptotic effect of conjugate is mediated through the activation of caspases, and is correlated with the blockade of the Akt and ERK signaling pathways in MCF-7 cells.

Abstract: Activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program promotes cell invasion and metastasis, and is reversed through mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) after formation of distant metastases. Here, we show that an imbalance of gene products encoded by the transcriptional factor C/EBPβ, LAP (liver-enriched activating protein) and LIP (liver-enriched inhibitory protein), can regulate both EMT- and MET-like phenotypic changes in mouse mammary epithelial cells. By using tetracycline repressive LIP expression constructs, we found that SCp2 cells, a clonal epithelial line of COMMA1-D cells, expressed EMT markers, lost the ability to undergo alveolar-like morphogenesis in 3D Matrigel, and acquired properties of benign adenoma cells. Conversely, we found that inducible expression of LAP in SCg6 cells, a clonal fibroblastic line of COMMA1-D cells, began to express epithelial keratins with suppression of proliferation. The overexpression of the C/EBPβ gene products in these COMMA1-D derivatives was suppressed by long-term cultivation on tissue culture plastic, but gene expression was maintained in cells grown on Matrigel or exposed to proteasome inhibitors. Thus, imbalances of C/EBPβ gene products in mouse mammary epithelial cells, which are affected by contact with basement membrane, are defined as a potential regulator of metastatic potential.

Abstract: Angiosarcomas are rare soft-tissue sarcomas of endothelial cell origin. They can be sporadic or caused by therapeutic radiation, hence secondary breast angiosarcomas are an important subgroup of patients. Assessing the molecular biology of angiosarcomas and identify specific targets for treatment is challenging. There is currently great interest in the role of angiogenesis and of angiogenic factors associated with tumor pathogenesis and as targets for treatment of angiosarcomas. A primary cell line derived from a skin fragment of a irradiation-induced angiosarcoma patient was obtained and utilized to evaluate cell biomarkers CD31, CD34, HIF-1alpha and VEGFRs expression by immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence, drugs cytotoxicity by cell counting and VEGF release by ELISA immunoassay. In addition to previous biomarkers, FVIII and VEGF were also evaluated on tumor specimens by immunohistochemistry to further confirm the diagnosis. We targeted the VEGF–VEGFR-2 axis of tumor angiogenesis with two different class of vascular targeted drugs; caprelsa, the VEGFR-2/EGFR/RET inhibitor and bevacizumab the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody. We found the same biomarkers expression either in tumor specimens and in the cell line derived from tumor. In vitro experiments demonstrated that angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in the progression of this tumor as cells displayed high level of VEGFR-2, HIF-1 alpha strongly accumulated into the nucleus and the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF was released by cells in culture medium. The evaluation of caprelsa and bevacizumab cytotoxicity demonstrated that both drugs were effective in inhibiting tumor proliferation. Due to these results, we started to treat the patient with pazopanib, which was the unique tyrosine kinase inhibitor available in Italy through a compassionate supply program, obtaining a long lasting partial response. Our data suggest that the study of the primary cell line could help physicians in choosing a therapeutic approach for patient that almost in vitro shows chances of success and that the anti-angiogenetic agents are a reliable therapeutic opportunity for angiosarcomas patients.

Abstract: The neuropeptide VGF (non-acronymic), which has antidepressant-like effects, enhances adult hippocampal neurogenesis as well as synaptic activity and plasticity in the hippocampus, however the interaction between these processes and the mechanism underlying this regulation remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that VGF-derived peptide TLQP-62 specifically enhances the generation of early progenitor cells in nestin-GFP mice. Specifically, TLQP-62 significantly increases the number of Type 2a neural progenitor cells (NPCs) while reducing the number of more differentiated Type 3 cells. The effect of TLQP-62 on proliferation rather than differentiation was confirmed using NPCs in vitro; TLQP-62 but not scrambled peptide PEHN-62 increases proliferation in a cell line as well as in primary progenitors from adult hippocampus. Moreover, TLQP-62 but not scrambled peptide increases Cyclin D mRNA expression. The proliferation of NPCs induced by TLQP-62 requires synaptic activity, in particular through NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The activation of glutamate receptors by TLQP-62 activation induces phosphorylation of CaMKII through NMDA receptors and protein kinase D through metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Furthermore, pharmacological antagonists to CaMKII and PKD inhibit TLQP-62-induced proliferation of NPCs indicating that these signaling molecules downstream of glutamate receptors are essential for the actions of TLQP-62 on neurogenesis. We also show that TLQP-62 gradually activates Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)-receptor TrkB in vitro and that Trk signaling is required for TLQP-62-induced proliferation of NPCs. Understanding the precise molecular mechanism of how TLQP-62 influences neurogenesis may reveal mechanisms by which VGF-derived peptides act as antidepressant-like agents.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza A virus RNA synthesis is catalyzed by the viral polymerase comprised of the PA, PB1, and PB2 proteins. We show that the host DDX21 RNA helicase restricts influenza A virus by binding PB1 and inhibiting polymerase assembly, resulting in reduced viral RNA and protein synthesis. Later during infection, the viral NS1 protein overcomes this restriction by binding to DDX21 and displacing PB1. DDX21 binds to a region of the NS1 N-terminal domain that also participates in other critical functions. A virus mutant whose NS1 protein is unable to bind DDX21 exhibits reduced viral protein synthesis at both late and early times of infection, a phenotype converted to wild-type upon DDX21 knockdown. As sequential interaction of PB1 and NS1 with DDX21 leads to temporal regulation of viral gene expression, influenza A virus likely uses the DDX21-NS1 interaction not only to overcome restriction, but also to regulate the viral life cycle.

Abstract: Recent methodological advances have improved the ease and efficiency of generating human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), but this now typically results in a greater number of hiPSC clones being derived than can be wholly characterized. It is therefore imperative that methods are developed which facilitate rapid selection of hiPSC clones most suited for the downstream research aims. Here we describe a combination of procedures enabling the simultaneous screening of multiple clones to determine their genomic integrity as well as their cardiac differentiation potential within two weeks of the putative reprogrammed colonies initially appearing. By coupling splinkerette-PCR with Ion Torrent sequencing, we could ascertain the number and map the proviral integration sites in lentiviral-reprogrammed hiPSCs. In parallel, we developed an effective cardiac differentiation protocol that generated functional cardiomyocytes within 10 days without requiring line-specific optimization for any of the six independent human pluripotent stem cell lines tested. Finally, to demonstrate the scalable potential of these procedures, we picked 20 nascent iPSC clones and performed these independent assays concurrently. Before the clones required passaging, we were able to identify clones with a single integrated copy of the reprogramming vector and robust cardiac differentiation potential for further analysis.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold great promise for in vitro generation of disease-relevant cell types, such as mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons involved in Parkinson’s disease. Although iPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons have been generated, detailed genetic and epigenetic characterizations of such neurons are lacking. The goal of this study was to examine the authenticity of iPSC-derived DA neurons obtained by established protocols. We FACS purified mdDA (Pitx3Gfp/+) neurons derived from mouse iPSCs and primary mdDA (Pitx3Gfp/+) neurons to analyze and compare their genetic and epigenetic features. Although iPSC-derived DA neurons largely adopted characteristics of their in vivo counterparts, relevant deviations in global gene expression and DNA methylation were found. Hypermethylated genes, mainly involved in neurodevelopment and basic neuronal functions, consequently showed reduced expression levels. Such abnormalities should be addressed because they might affect unambiguous long-term functionality and hamper the potential of iPSC-derived DA neurons for in vitro disease modeling or cell-based therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons generated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) self-organize into functional neuronal assemblies in vitro, generating synchronous network activities. Intriguingly, PSC-derived neuronal assemblies develop spontaneous activities that are independent of external stimulation, suggesting the presence of thus far undetected intrinsically active neurons (IANs). Here, by using mouse embryonic stem cells, we provide evidence for the existence of IANs in PSC-neuronal networks based on extracellular multielectrode array and intracellular patch-clamp recordings. IANs remain active after pharmacological inhibition of fast synaptic communication and possess intrinsic mechanisms required for autonomous neuronal activity. PSC-derived IANs are functionally integrated in PSC-neuronal populations, contribute to synchronous network bursting, and exhibit pacemaker properties. The intrinsic activity and pacemaker properties of the neuronal subpopulation identified herein may be particularly relevant for interventions involving transplantation of neural tissues. IANs may be a key element in the regulation of the functional activity of grafted as well as preexisting host neuronal networks.

Abstract: ANKHD1 is a multiple ankyrin repeat containing protein, recently identified as a novel member of the Hippo signaling pathway. The present study aimed to investigate the role of ANKHD1 in DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. ANKHD1 and YAP1 were found to be highly expressed in prostate cancer cells, and ANKHD1 silencing decreased cell growth, delayed cell cycle progression at the S phase, and reduced tumor xenograft growth. Moreover, ANKHD1 knockdown downregulated YAP1 expression and activation, and reduced the expression of CCNA2, a YAP1 target gene. These findings indicate that ANKHD1 is a positive regulator of YAP1 and promotes cell growth and cell cycle progression through Cyclin A upregulation.

Abstract: This study was performed to identify the potential role of Alpha-2 Heremans Schmid Glycoprotein (AHSG) in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) tumorigenesis using an HNSCC cell line model. HNSCC cell lines are unique among cancer cell lines, in that they produce endogenous AHSG and do not rely, solely, on AHSG derived from serum. To produce our model, we performed a stable transfection to down-regulate AHSG in the HNSCC cell line SQ20B, resulting in three SQ20B sublines, AH50 with 50% AHSG production, AH20 with 20% AHSG production and EV which is the empty vector control expressing wild-type levels of AHSG. Utilizing these sublines, we examined the effect of AHSG depletion on cellular adhesion, proliferation, migration and invasion in a serum-free environment. We demonstrated that sublines EV and AH50 adhered to plastic and laminin significantly faster than the AH20 cell line, supporting the previously reported role of exogenous AHSG in cell adhesion. As for proliferative potential, EV had the greatest amount of proliferation with AH50 proliferation significantly diminished. AH20 cells did not proliferate at all. Depletion of AHSG also diminished cellular migration and invasion. TGF-β was examined to determine whether levels of the TGF-β binding AHSG influenced the effect of TGF-β on cell signaling and proliferation. Whereas higher levels of AHSG blunted TGF-β influenced SMAD and ERK signaling, it did not clearly affect proliferation, suggesting that AHSG influences on adhesion, proliferation, invasion and migration are primarily due to its role in adhesion and cell spreading. The previously reported role of AHSG in potentiating metastasis via protecting MMP-9 from autolysis was also supported in this cell line based model system of endogenous AHSG production in HNSCC. Together, these data show that endogenously produced AHSG in an HNSCC cell line, promotes in vitro cellular properties identified as having a role in tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Using a viral model of the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS), we show that intraspinal transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursor cells (hNPCs) results in sustained clinical recovery, although hNPCs were not detectable beyond day 8 posttransplantation. Improved motor skills were associated with a reduction in neuroinflammation, decreased demyelination, and enhanced remyelination. Evidence indicates that the reduced neuroinflammation is correlated with an increased number of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the spinal cords. Coculture of hNPCs with activated T cells resulted in reduced T cell proliferation and increased Treg numbers. The hNPCs acted, in part, through secretion of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2. These findings indicate that the transient presence of hNPCs transplanted in an animal model of MS has powerful immunomodulatory effects and mediates recovery. Further investigation of the restorative effects of hNPC transplantation may aid in the development of clinically relevant MS treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients are at high risk of contracting pneumococcal infection. To address this risk, they receive pneumococcal vaccines, and antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment. To assess the impact of SCD and these interventions on pneumococcal genetic architecture, we examined the genomes of more than 300 pneumococcal isolates from SCD patients over 20 years. Modern SCD strains retained invasive capacity but shifted away from the serotypes used in vaccines. These strains had specific genetic changes related to antibiotic resistance, capsule biosynthesis, metabolism, and metal transport. A murine SCD model coupled with Tn-seq mutagenesis identified 60 noncapsular pneumococcal genes under differential selective pressure in SCD, which correlated with aspects of SCD pathophysiology. Further, virulence determinants in the SCD context were distinct from the general population, and protective capacity of potential antigens was lost over time in SCD. This highlights the importance of understanding bacterial pathogenesis in the context of high-risk individuals.

Abstract: Evidence is emerging that podocytes are able to endocytose proteins such as albumin using kinetics consistent with a receptor-mediated process. To date the role of the fatty acid moiety on albumin uptake kinetics has not been delineated and the receptor responsible for uptake is yet to be identified. Albumin uptake studies were carried out on cultured human podocytes exposed to FITC-labelled human serum albumin either carrying fatty acids (HSA+FA) or depleted of them (HSA−FA). Receptor-mediated endocytosis of FITC-HSA+FA over 60min was 5 times greater than that of FITC-HSA−FA. 24h exposure of podocytes to albumin up-regulated nephrin expression and induced the activation of caspase-3. These effects were more pronounced in response to HSA−FA. Individually, anti-CD36 antibodies had no effect upon endocytosis of FITC-HSA. However, a cocktail of 2 antibodies reduced uptake by nearly 50%. Albumin endocytosis was enhanced in the presence of the CD36 specific inhibitor sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO) while knock-down of CD36 using CD36siRNA had no effect on uptake. These data suggest that receptor-mediated endocytosis of albumin by podocytes is regulated by the fatty acid moiety, although, some of the detrimental effects are induced independently of it. CD36 does not play a direct role in the uptake of albumin.

Abstract: Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are highly hydrophilic, low complexity proteins whose expression has been correlated with desiccation tolerance in anhydrobiotic organisms. Here, we report the identification of three new mitochondrial LEA proteins in anhydrobiotic embryos of Artemia franciscana, AfrLEA3m_47, AfrLEA3m_43, and AfrLEA3m_29. These new isoforms are recognized by antibody raised against recombinant AfrLEA3m, the original mitochondrial-targeted LEA protein previously reported from these embryos; mass spectrometry confirms all four proteins share sequence similarity. The corresponding messenger RNA (mRNA) species for the four proteins are readily amplified from total complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared from embryos. cDNA sequences of the four mRNAs are quite similar, but each has a stretch of sequence that is absent in at least one of the others, plus multiple single base pair differences. We conclude that all four mitochondrial LEA proteins are products of independent genes. Each possesses a mitochondrial targeting sequence, and indeed Western blots performed on extracts of isolated mitochondria clearly detect all four isoforms. Based on mass spectrometry and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis migration, the cytoplasmic-localized AfrLEA2 exists primarily as a homodimer in A. franciscana. Quantification of protein expression for AfrLEA2, AfrLEA3m, AfrLEA3m_43, and AfrLEA3m_29 as a function of development shows that cellular concentrations are highest in diapause embryos and decrease during development to low levels in desiccation-intolerant nauplius larvae. When adjustment is made for mitochondria matrix volume, the effective concentrations of cytoplasmic versus mitochondrial group 3 LEA proteins are similar in vivo, and the values provide guidance for the design of in vitro functional studies with these proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The CADUCEUS trial of cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) has shown that it may be possible to regenerate injured heart muscle previously thought to be permanently scarred. The mechanisms of benefit are known to be indirect, but the mediators have yet to be identified. Here we pinpoint exosomes secreted by human CDCs as critical agents of regeneration and cardioprotection. CDC exosomes inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation of cardiomyocytes, while enhancing angiogenesis. Injection of exosomes into injured mouse hearts recapitulates the regenerative and functional effects produced by CDC transplantation, whereas inhibition of exosome production by CDCs blocks those benefits. CDC exosomes contain a distinctive complement of microRNAs, with particular enrichment of miR-146a. Selective administration of a miR-146a mimic reproduces some (but not all) of the benefits of CDC exosomes. The findings identify exosomes as key mediators of CDC-induced regeneration, while highlighting the potential utility of exosomes as cell-free therapeutic candidates.

Abstract: Correct formation of the corneal endothelium is essential for continued development of the anterior segment of the eye. Corneal endothelial development is initiated at E12 when precursor peri-ocular mesenchyme cells migrate into the space between the lens and the presumptive corneal epithelium and begin to respond to signals from the lens, undergoing a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) that is complete by E15.5. To study the initiation of MET, peri-ocular mesenchyme cell lines were derived from E12.5 and E13.5 murine embryos. These cells expressed key transcription factors, Foxc1 and Pitx2, as well as Slug and Tsc22, genes involved in MET. We have shown that all these genes must be down-regulated by E13.5 for differentiation to proceed. Lens-derived signals play a role in this down-regulation with Tgfβ2 specifically down-regulating Foxc1 and Pitx2. Over-expression and knock-down of Foxc1 significantly and similarly affected the expression of Pitx2, Tsc22 and Slug while Foxc1 was shown to play a role in mediating the lens effects on Slug. Thus, for the progression of initial corneal endothelial development, the key transcription factors, Foxc1 and Pitx2, as well as genes involved in MET, Slug and Tsc-22, must be down-regulated, a process driven by the lens and Foxc1.

Abstract: Tendon injuries are common in sports and are frequent reasons for orthopedic consultations. The management of damaged tendons is one of the most challenging problems in orthopedics. Mechano-growth factor (MGF), a recently discovered growth repair factor, plays positive roles in tissue repair through the improvement of cell proliferation and migration and the protection of cells against injury-induced apoptosis. However, it remains unclear whether MGF has the potential to accelerate tendon repair. We used a scratch wound assay in this study to demonstrate that MGF-C25E (a synthetic mechano-growth factor E peptide) promotes the migration of rat tenocytes and that this promotion is accompanied by an elevation in the expression of the following signaling molecules: focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2). Inhibitors of the FAK and ERK1/2 pathways inhibited the MGF-C25E-induced tenocyte migration, indicating that MGF-C25E promotes tenocyte migration through the FAK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The analysis of the mechanical properties showed that the Young's modulus of tenocytes was decreased through treatment of MGF-C25E, and an obvious formation of pseudopodia and F-actin was observed in MGF-C25E-treated tenocytes. The inhibition of the FAK or ERK1/2 signals restored the decrease in Young's modulus and inhibited the formation of pseudopodia and F-actin. Overall, our study demonstrated that MGF-C25E promotes rat tenocyte migration by lessening cell stiffness and increasing pseudopodia formation via the FAK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Background
Ovarian teratocarcinoma (OVTC) arises from germ cells and contains a high percentage of cancer stem/progenitor cells (CSPCs), which promote cancer development through their ability to self-renew. Androgen and androgen receptor (androgen/AR) signaling has been reported to participate in cancer stemness in some types of cancer; however, this phenomenon has never been studied in OVTC.
Methods
Ovarian teratocarcinoma cell line PA1 was manipulated to overexpress or knockdown AR by lentiviral deliver system. After analyzing of AR expression in PA1 cells, cell growth assay was assessed at every given time point. In order to determine ligand effect on AR actions, luciferase assay was performed to evaluate endogenous and exogenous AR function in PA1 cells. CD133 stem cell marker antibody was used to identify CSPCs in PA1 cells, and AR expression level in enriched CSPCs was determined. To assess AR effects on CD133+ population progression, stem cell functional assays (side population, sphere formation assay, CD133 expression) were used to analyze role of AR in PA1 CSPCs. In tissue specimen, immunohistochemistry staining was used to carry out AR and CD133 staining in normal and tumor tissue.
Results
We examined androgen/AR signaling in OVTC PA1 cells, a CSPCs-rich cell line, and found that AR, but not androgen, promoted cell growth. We also examined the effects of AR on CSPCs characteristics and found that AR expression was more abundant in CD133+ cells, a well-defined ovarian cancer stem/progenitor marker, than in CD133− populations. Moreover, results of the sphere formation assay revealed that AR expression was required to maintain CSPCs populations. Interestingly, this AR-governed self-renewal capacity of CSPCs was only observed in CD133+ cells. In addition, we found that AR-mediated CSPCs enrichment was accompanied by down-regulation of p53 and p16. Finally, co-expression of AR and CD133 was more abundant in OVTC lesions than in normal ovarian tissue.
Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that AR itself might play a ligand-independent role in the development of OVTC.

Abstract: Summary
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) strategies to purify distinct cell types from the pool of fetal human myofiber-associated (hMFA) cells were developed. We demonstrate that cells expressing the satellite cell marker PAX7 are highly enriched within the subset of CD45−CD11b−GlyA−CD31−CD34−CD56intITGA7hi hMFA cells. These CD45−CD11b−GlyA−CD31−CD34−CD56intITGA7hi cells lack adipogenic capacity but exhibit robust, bipotent myogenic and osteogenic activity in vitro and engraft myofibers when transplanted into mouse muscle. In contrast, CD45−CD11b−GlyA−CD31−CD34+ fetal hMFA cells represent stromal constituents of muscle that do not express PAX7, lack myogenic function, and exhibit adipogenic and osteogenic capacity in vitro. Adult muscle likewise contains PAX7+ CD45−CD11b−GlyA−CD31−CD34−CD56intITGA7hi hMFA cells with in vitro myogenic and osteogenic activity, although these cells are present at lower frequency in comparison to their fetal counterparts. The ability to directly isolate functionally distinct progenitor cells from human muscle will enable novel insights into muscle lineage specification and homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Epidermal stem cells have been in clinical application as a source of culture-generated grafts. Although applications for such cells are increasing due to aging populations and the greater incidence of diabetes, current keratinocyte grafting technology is limited by immunological barriers and the time needed for culture amplification. We studied the feasibility of using human fetal skin cells for allogeneic transplantation and showed that fetal keratinocytes have faster expansion times, longer telomeres, lower immunogenicity indicators, and greater clonogenicity with more stem cell indicators than adult keratinocytes. The fetal cells did not induce proliferation of T cells in coculture and were able to suppress the proliferation of stimulated T cells. Nevertheless, fetal keratinocytes could stratify normally in vitro. Experimental transplantation of fetal keratinocytes in vivo seeded on an engineered plasma scaffold yielded a well-stratified epidermal architecture and showed stable skin regeneration. These results support the possibility of using fetal skin cells for cell-based therapeutic grafting.

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) transplantation improves healing of injured and diseased skeletal muscle, although the mechanisms of benefit are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether MSCs and/or their trophic factors were able to regulate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and activity in different cells of the muscle tissue. MSCs in co-culture with C2C12 cells or their conditioned medium (MSC-CM) up-regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and function in the myoblastic cells; these effects were concomitant with the down-regulation of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and -2 and with increased cell motility. In the single muscle fiber experiments, MSC-CM administration increased MMP-2/9 expression in Pax-7+ satellite cells and stimulated their mobilization, differentiation and fusion. The anti-fibrotic properties of MSC-CM involved also the regulation of MMPs by skeletal fibroblasts and the inhibition of their differentiation into myofibroblasts. The treatment with SB-3CT, a potent MMP inhibitor, prevented in these cells, the decrease of α-smooth actin and type-I collagen expression induced by MSC-CM, suggesting that MSC-CM could attenuate the fibrogenic response through mechanisms mediated by MMPs. Our results indicate that growth factors and cytokines released by these cells may modulate the fibrotic response and improve the endogenous mechanisms of muscle repair/regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The cytosolic sensor MDA5 is crucial for antiviral innate immune defense against various RNA viruses including measles virus; as such, many viruses have evolved strategies to antagonize the antiviral activity of MDA5. Here, we show that measles virus escapes MDA5 detection by targeting the phosphatases PP1α and PP1γ, which regulate MDA5 activity by removing an inhibitory phosphorylation mark. The V proteins of measles virus and the related paramyxovirus Nipah virus interact with PP1α/γ, preventing PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of MDA5 and thereby its activation. The PP1 interaction with the measles V protein is mediated by a conserved PP1-binding motif in the C-terminal region of the V protein. A recombinant measles virus expressing a mutant V protein deficient in PP1 binding is unable to antagonize MDA5 and is growth impaired due to its inability to suppress interferon induction. This identifies PP1 antagonism as a mechanism employed by paramyxoviruses for evading innate immune recognition.

Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a novel gasotransmitter that plays multiple biological roles in various body systems. In addition to its endogenous production, H2S is produced by bacteria colonizing digestive organs, including the oral cavity. H2S was previously shown to enhance pro-apoptotic effects in cancer cell lines, although the mechanisms involved remain unclear. To properly assess the anti-cancer effects of H2S, however, investigations of apoptotic effects in normal cells are also necessary. The aims of this study were (1) to compare the susceptibility to H2S-induced apoptosis between the oral cancer cell line Ca9-22 and oral keratinocytes that were derived from healthy gingiva, and (2) to identify candidate genes involved in the induction of apoptosis by H2S. The susceptibility to H2S-induced apoptosis in Ca9-22 cells was significantly higher than that in keratinocytes. H2S exposure in Ca9-22 cells, but not keratinocytes, enhanced the expression of pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 1 (PHLDA1), which was identified through a differential display method. In addition, PHLDA1 expression increased during actinomycin D-induced apoptosis in Ca9-22 cells. Knockdown of PHLDA1 expression by small interfering RNA in Ca9-22 cells led to expression of active caspase 3, thus indicating apoptosis induction. The tongue cancer cell line SCC-25, which expresses PHLDA1 at a high level, showed similar effects. Our data indicate that H2S is an anti-cancer compound that may contribute to the low incidence of oral cancer. Furthermore, we demonstrated the role of PHLDA1 as an apoptosis suppressor.

Abstract: The aims of the present study are to investigate the clinicopathological correlations of JK-1(FAM134B) expression and its relationship to carcinogenesis in a colorectal adenoma–adenocarcinoma model. JK-1(FAM134B) protein expression was studied in a colon cancer cell line by Western blot and immunocytochemistry. JK-1(FAM134B) expression profiles at mRNA and protein levels were investigated in cancer tissues from 236 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma and 32 patients with colorectal adenoma using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The findings were then correlated with the clinicopathological features of these tumours. JK-1(FAM134B) protein was demonstrated in the colon cancer cells by Western blot. The protein was located in the nuclei of the tumour cells at both cellular and tissue levels. In colorectal adenocarcinomas, lower levels of JK-1(FAM134B) protein expression were associated with younger age (p=0.032), larger tumour size (p=0.004), advanced cancer stages (p=0.016) and higher rates of cancer recurrence (p=0.04). Also, lower levels of JK-1(FAM134B) mRNA expression were associated with advanced cancer stages (p=0.02) and presence of lymphovascular invasion (p=0.014). Higher JK-1(FAM134B) mRNA and protein expression levels were identified in adenomas and non-neoplastic mucosae, compared to carcinomas (p=0.005). To conclude, JK-1(FAM134B) mRNA expression and JK1 (FAM134B) protein levels varied with the different stages of progression of colorectal tumours. The expression levels of the gene were associated with clinicopathological features in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma suggesting that JK-1(FAM134B) gene has roles in controlling some steps in the development of the invasive phenotypes from colorectal adenoma to early staged as well as advanced staged colorectal adenocarcinomas.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclic activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway controls cell fusion-mediated somatic cell reprogramming. TCFs belong to a family of transcription factors that, in complex with β-catenin, bind and transcriptionally regulate Wnt target genes. Here, we show that Wnt/β-catenin signaling needs to be off during the early reprogramming phases of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into iPSCs. In MEFs undergoing reprogramming, senescence genes are repressed and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition is favored. This is correlated with a repressive activity of TCF1, which contributes to the silencing of Wnt/β-catenin signaling at the onset of reprogramming. In contrast, the Wnt pathway needs to be active in the late reprogramming phases to achieve successful reprogramming. In conclusion, continued activation or inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is detrimental to the reprogramming of MEFs; instead, temporal perturbation of the pathway is essential for efficient reprogramming, and the “Wnt-off” state can be considered an early reprogramming marker.

Abstract: The MB49 bladder cancer cell vaccine was effective against bladder cancer in the mice model in previous studies. However, part of the tumors regrew as the vaccine could not eliminate the cancer stem cells (CSCs). MB49 bladder cancer stem cells (MCSCs) were isolated by a combination of the limited dilution method and the serum free culture medium method. MCSCs possessed higher expression of CD133, CD44, OCT4, NANOG, and ABCG2, the ability of differentiation, higher proliferative abilities, lower susceptibility to chemotherapy, greater migration in vitro, and stronger tumorigenic abilities in vivo. Then streptavidin–mouse granulocyte macrophage–colony stimulating factor (SA–mGM–CSF) MCSCs vaccine was prepared. SA–mGM–CSF MCSCs vaccine extended the survival of the mice and inhibited the growth of tumor in protective, therapeutic, memorial and specific immune response experiments. The level of immunoglobulin G and the ratio of dendritic cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were highest in the experimental group when compared to those in other four control groups, as well as for the cytotoxicity assay. We demonstrated that SA–mGM–CSF MCSCs vaccine induces an antitumor immune response to metastatic bladder cancer.

Abstract: Coiled‐coil alpha‐helical rod protein 1 (CCHCR1) is suggested as a candidate biomarker for psoriasis for more than a decade but its function remains poorly understood because of the inconsistent findings in the literature. CCHCR1 protein is suggested to be localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, or centrosome and to regulate various cellular functions, including steroidogenesis, proliferation, differentiation, and cytoskeleton organization. In this study, we attempted to find a consensus between these findings by identifying the interaction partners of CCHCR1 using co-immunoprecipiation with a stable cell line expressing EGFP-tagged CCHCR1. Out of more than 100 co-immunoprecipitants identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), the enhancer of mRNA-decapping protein 4 (EDC4), which is a processing body (P-body) component, was particularly found to be the major interacting partner of CCHCR1. Confocal imaging confirmed the localization of CCHCR1 in P-bodies and its N-terminus is required for this subcellular localization, suggesting that CCHCR1 is a novel P-body component. As P-bodies are the site for mRNA metabolism, our findings provide a molecular basis for the function of CCHCR1, any disruption of which may affect the transcriptome of the cell, and causing abnormal cell functions.

Abstract: Cancer cells in poorly vascularized tumor regions need to adapt to an unfavorable metabolic microenvironment. As distance from supplying blood vessels increases, oxygen and nutrient concentrations decrease and cancer cells react by stopping cell cycle progression and becoming dormant. As cytostatic drugs mainly target proliferating cells, cancer cell dormancy is considered as a major resistance mechanism to this class of anti-cancer drugs. Therefore, substances that target cancer cells in poorly vascularized tumor regions have the potential to enhance cytostatic-based chemotherapy of solid tumors. With three-dimensional growth conditions, multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) reproduce several parameters of the tumor microenvironment, including oxygen and nutrient gradients as well as the development of dormant tumor regions. We here report the setup of a 3D cell culture compatible high-content screening system and the identification of nine substances from two commercially available drug libraries that specifically target cells in inner MCTS core regions, while cells in outer MCTS regions or in 2D cell culture remain unaffected. We elucidated the mode of action of the identified compounds as inhibitors of the respiratory chain and show that induction of cell death in inner MCTS core regions critically depends on extracellular glucose concentrations. Finally, combinational treatment with cytostatics showed increased induction of cell death in MCTS. The data presented here shows for the first time a high-content based screening setup on 3D tumor spheroids for the identification of substances that specifically induce cell death in inner tumor spheroid core regions. This validates the approach to use 3D cell culture screening systems to identify substances that would not be detectable by 2D based screening in otherwise similar culture conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Herpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), encode multiple microRNAs (miRNA) whose targets are just being uncovered. Moreover, miRNA function during the virus life cycle is relatively unknown. We find that HCMV miRs UL112-1, US5-1, and US5-2 target multiple components of the host secretory pathway, including VAMP3, RAB5C, RAB11A, SNAP23, and CDC42. A HCMV miR UL112-1, US5-1, and US5-2 triple mutant displayed aberrant morphogenesis of the virion assembly compartment (VAC), increased secretion of noninfectious particles, and increased IL-6 release from infected cells. Ectopic expression of miRs UL112-1, US5-1, and US5-2 or siRNAs directed against RAB5C, RAB11A, SNAP23, and CDC42 caused the loss of Golgi stacks with reorganization into structures that resemble the VAC and a decrease in cytokine release. These observations indicate that multiple HCMV miRNAs coordinately regulate reorganization of the secretory pathway to control cytokine secretion and facilitate formation of the VAC for efficient infectious virus production.

Measles Virus Suppresses RIG-I-like Receptor Activation in Dendritic Cells via DC-SIGN-Mediated Inhibition of PP1 Phosphatases,

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cells (DCs) are targets of measles virus (MV) and play central roles in viral dissemination. However, DCs express the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I and Mda5 that sense MV and induce type I interferon (IFN) production. Given the potency of this antiviral response, RLRs are tightly regulated at various steps, including dephosphorylation by PP1 phosphatases, which induces their activation. We demonstrate that MV suppresses RIG-I and Mda5 by activating the C-type lectin DC-SIGN and inducing signaling that prevents RLR dephosphorylation. MV binding to DC-SIGN leads to activation of the kinase Raf-1, which induces the association of PP1 inhibitor I-1 with GADD34-PP1 holoenzymes, thereby inhibiting phosphatase activity. Consequently, GADD34-PP1 holoenzymes are unable to dephosphorylate RIG-I and Mda5, hence suppressing type I IFN responses and enhancing MV replication. Blocking DC-SIGN signaling allows RLR activation and suppresses MV infection of DCs. Thus, MV subverts DC-SIGN to control RLR activation and escape antiviral responses.

Abstract: Summary
Despite over a decade of intense research, the identity and differentiation potential of human adult cardiac progenitor cells (aCPC) remains controversial. Cardiospheres have been proposed as a means to expand aCPCs in vitro, but the identity of the progenitor cell within these 3D structures is unknown. We show that clones derived from cardiospheres could be subdivided based on expression of thymocyte differentiation antigen 1 (THY-1/CD90) into two distinct populations that exhibit divergent cardiac differentiation potential. One population, which is CD90+, expressed markers consistent with a mesenchymal/myofibroblast cell. The second clone type was CD90− and could form mature, functional myocytes with sarcomeres albeit at a very low rate. These two populations of cardiogenic clones displayed distinct cell surface markers and unique transcriptomes. Our study suggests that a rare aCPC exists in cardiospheres along with a mesenchymal/myofibroblast cell, which demonstrates incomplete cardiac myocyte differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Werner syndrome (WS) patients exhibit premature aging predominantly in mesenchyme-derived tissues, but not in neural lineages, a consequence of telomere dysfunction and accelerated senescence. The cause of this lineage-specific aging remains unknown. Here, we document that reprogramming of WS fibroblasts to pluripotency elongated telomere length and prevented telomere dysfunction. To obtain mechanistic insight into the origin of tissue-specific aging, we differentiated iPSCs to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs). We observed recurrence of premature senescence associated with accelerated telomere attrition and defective synthesis of the lagging strand telomeres in MSCs, but not in NPCs. We postulate this “aging” discrepancy is regulated by telomerase. Expression of hTERT or p53 knockdown ameliorated the accelerated aging phenotypein MSC, whereas inhibition of telomerase sensitized NPCs to DNA damage. Our findings unveil a role for telomerase in the protection of accelerated aging in a specific lineage of stem cells.

High glucose increases Cdk5 activity in podocytes via transforming growth factor-β1 signaling pathway,

Abstract: Podocytes are highly specialized and terminally differentiated glomerular cells that play a vital role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), who is an atypical but essential member of the Cdk family of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases, has been shown as a key regulator of podocyte differentiation, proliferation and morphology. Our previous studies demonstrated that the expression of Cdk5 was significantly increased in podocytes of diabetic rats, and was closely related with podocyte injury of DN. However, the mechanisms of how expression and activity of Cdk5 are regulated under the high glucose environment have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we showed that high glucose up-regulated the expression of Cdk5 and its co-activator p35 with a concomitant increase in Cdk5 kinase activity in conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes in vitro. When exposed to 30mM glucose, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) was activated. Most importantly, we found that SB431542, the Tgfbr1 inhibitor, significantly decreased the expression of Cdk5 and p35 and Cdk5 kinase activity in high glucose-treated podocytes. Moreover, high glucose increased the expression of early growth response-1 (Egr-1) via TGF-β1-ERK1/2 pathway in podocytes and inhibition of Egr-1 by siRNA decreased p35 expression and Cdk5 kinase activity. Furthermore, inhibition of Cdk5 kinase activity effectively alleviated podocyte apoptosis induced by high glucose or TGF-β1. Thus, the TGF-β1-ERK1/2-Egr-1 signaling pathway may regulate the p35 expression and Cdk5 kinase activity in high glucose-treated podocytes, which contributes to podocyte injury of DN.

Abstract: Summary
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a form of X-linked leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene. Although PLP1 proteins with missense mutations have been shown to accumulate in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in disease model animals and cell lines transfected with mutant PLP1 genes, the exact pathogenetic mechanism of PMD has not previously been clarified. In this study, we established induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two PMD patients carrying missense mutation and differentiated them into oligodendrocytes in vitro. In the PMD iPSC-derived oligodendrocytes, mislocalization of mutant PLP1 proteins to the ER and an association between increased susceptibility to ER stress and increased numbers of apoptotic oligodendrocytes were observed. Moreover, electron microscopic analysis demonstrated drastically reduced myelin formation accompanied by abnormal ER morphology. Thus, this study demonstrates the involvement of ER stress in pathogenic dysmyelination in the oligodendrocytes of PMD patients with the PLP1 missense mutation.

Abstract: The structure of a tissue engineering scaffold plays an important role in modulating tissue growth. A novel gelatin–chitosan (Gel–Cs) scaffold with a unique structure produced by three-dimensional printing (3DP) technology combining with vacuum freeze-drying has been developed for tissue-engineering applications. The scaffold composed of overall construction, micro-pore, surface morphology, and effective mechanical property. Such a structure meets the essential design criteria of an ideal engineered scaffold. The favorable cell–matrix interaction supports the active biocompatibility of the structure. The structure is capable of supporting cell attachment and proliferation. Cells seeded into this structure tend to maintain phenotypic shape and secreted large amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM) and the cell growth decreased the mechanical properties of scaffold. This novel biodegradable scaffold has potential applications for tissue engineering based upon its unique structure, which acts to support cell growth.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms of transcriptional regulation underlying human primordial germ cell (PGC) differentiation are largely unknown. The transcriptional repressor Prdm1/Blimp-1 is known to play a critical role in controlling germ cell specification in mice. Here, we show that PRDM1 is expressed in developing human gonads and contributes to the determination of germline versus neural fate in early development. We show that knockdown of PRDM1 in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) impairs germline potential and upregulates neural genes. Conversely, ectopic expression of PRDM1 in hESCs promotes the generation of cells that exhibit phenotypic and transcriptomic features of early PGCs. Furthermore, PRDM1 suppresses transcription of SOX2. Overexpression of SOX2 in hESCs under conditions favoring germline differentiation skews cell fate from the germline to the neural lineage. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PRDM1 serves as a molecular switch to modulate the divergence of neural or germline fates through repression of SOX2 during human development.

Abstract: The application of nanotechnology for drug targeting underlines the importance of controlling the kinetics and cellular sites of delivery for optimal therapeutic outcomes. Here we examined the effect of particle size on internalization and degradation of surface-bound fibronectin by fibroblasts using polystyrene nanoparticles (NPs; 51nm) and microparticles (MPs; 1 μm). Fibronectin was strongly bound by NPs and MPs as assessed by immuno-dot blot analysis (5.1 ±0.4×10– 5pg fibronectin per μm2 of NP surface; 4.2±±0.3×10–5pg fibronectin per μm2 of MP surface; p>0.2). We estimated that ~193 fibronectin molecules bound to a MP compared with 0.6 fibronectin molecules per NP, indicating that ~40% of nanoparticles were not bound by fibronectin. One hour after incubation, fibronectin-coated NPs and MPs were rapidly internalized by Rat-2 fibroblasts. MPs and NPs were engulfed partly by receptor-mediated endocytosis as indicated by decreased uptake when incubated at 4°C, or by depletion of ATP with sodium azide. Pulse-chase experiments showed minimal exocytosis of NPs and MPs. Internalization of NPs and MPs was inhibited by jasplakinolide, whereas internalization of MPs but not NPs was inhibited by latrunculin B and by integrin-blocking antibodies. Extraction of plasma membrane cholesterol with methyl β-cyclodextrin inhibited internalization of fibronectin-coated NPs but not MPs. Biotinylated fibronectin internalized by cells was extensively degraded on MPs but not NPs. Particle size affects actin and clathrin-dependent internalization mechanisms leading to fibronectin degradation on MPs but not NPs. Thus either prolonged, controlled release or an immediate delivery of drugs can be achieved by adjusting the particle size along with matrix proteins such as FN.

Abstract: Quinolinic acid (QUIN) is a glutamate agonist which markedly enhances the vulnerability of neural cells to excitotoxicity. QUIN is produced from the amino acid tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway (KP). Dysregulation of this pathway is associated with neurodegenerative conditions. In this study we treated striatal astrocytes in culture with QUIN and assayed the endogenous phosphorylating system associated with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin as well as cytoskeletal remodeling. After 24h incubation with 100µM QUIN, cells were exposed to 32P-orthophosphate and/or protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase dependent of Ca2+/calmodulin II (PKCaMII) or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, H89 (20μM), KN93 (10μM) and staurosporin (10nM), respectively. Results showed that hyperphosphorylation was abrogated by PKA and PKC inhibitors but not by the PKCaMII inhibitor. The specific antagonists to ionotropic NMDA and non-NMDA (50µM DL-AP5 and CNQX, respectively) glutamate receptors as well as to metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGLUR; 50µM MCPG), mGLUR1 (100µM MPEP) and mGLUR5 (10µM 4C3HPG) prevented the hyperphosphorylation provoked by QUIN. Also, intra and extracellular Ca2+ quelators (1mM EGTA; 10µM BAPTA-AM, respectively) prevented QUIN-mediated effect, while Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel type L (L-VDCC) (blocker: 10µM verapamil) is not implicated in this effect. Morphological analysis showed dramatically altered actin cytoskeleton with concomitant change of morphology to fusiform and/or flattened cells with retracted cytoplasm and disruption of the GFAP meshwork, supporting misregulation of actin cytoskeleton. Both hyperphosphorylation and cytoskeletal remodeling were reversed 24h after QUIN removal. Astrocytes are highly plastic cells and the vulnerability of astrocyte cytoskeleton may have important implications for understanding the neurotoxicity of QUIN in neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Widely found in animal and plant-associated proteobacteria, type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are potentially capable of facilitating diverse interactions with eukaryotes and/or other bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes three distinct T6SS haemolysin coregulated protein (Hcp) secretion islands (H1, H2, and H3-T6SS), each involved in different aspects of the bacterium’s interaction with other organisms. Here we describe the characterization of a P. aeruginosa H3-T6SS-dependent phospholipase D effector, PldB, and its three tightly linked cognate immunity proteins. PldB targets the periplasm of prokaryotic cells and exerts an antibacterial activity. Surprisingly, PldB also facilitates intracellular invasion of host eukaryotic cells by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, revealing it to be a trans-kingdom effector. Our findings imply a potentially widespread T6SS-mediated mechanism, which deploys a single phospholipase effector to influence both prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic hosts.

Abstract: Many cell lines, despite the fact that they are easy to culture, tend to lose some of their in vivo characteristics in vitro, we therefore decided to investigate whether culturing HK-2 cells on kidney derived micro-scaffolds (KMS) could improve proximal tubule functionality to these cells. Kidney derived micro-scaffolds (KMS) have been prepared that, due to the fact that they are only 300µm in depth, allow for transfer of gasses and nutrients via diffusion whilst maintaining the kidney's intricate microstructure. Culturing HK-2 on KMS shows significant increase in expression of AQP-1, ATP1B1, SLC23A1 and SLC5A2 after 1, 2 and 3 weeks compared with HK-2 grown under standard tissue culture conditions. Additionally, very high levels of expression of CCL-2 (15–30 fold increase) and LRP-2 (25–200 fold increase) were observed when the HK-2 were grown on KMS compared with HK-2 grown under standard tissue culture conditions. Furthermore, HK-2 cells grown under standard conditions released higher levels of Il-6 and Il-8 compared with primary tubule cells (Asterand AS-9-2) and secreted no MCP-1 or RANTES as opposed to primary cells that released MCP-1 and RANTES following stimulation. However, HK-2 grown on KMS showed both a marked decrease in Il-6/Il-8 secretion in line with the primary cells and secreted MCP-1 as well. These results show that the micro-environment of the KMS assists in restoring in vivo like properties to the HK-2 cells.

Abstract: Insulin stimulated glucose uptake requires the colocalization of myosin IIA (MyoIIA) and the insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) at the plasma membrane for proper GLUT4 fusion. MyoIIA facilitates filamentous actin (F-actin) reorganization in various cell types. In adipocytes F-actin reorganization is required for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. What is not known is whether MyoIIA interacts with F-actin to regulate insulin-induced GLUT4 fusion at the plasma membrane. To elucidate the relationship between MyoIIA and F-actin, we examined the colocalization of MyoIIA and F-actin at the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation as well as the regulation of this interaction. Our findings demonstrated that MyoIIA and F-actin colocalized at the site of GLUT4 fusion with the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation. Furthermore, inhibition of MyoII with blebbistatin impaired F-actin localization at the plasma membrane. Next we examined the regulatory role of calcium in MyoIIA-F-actin colocalization. Reduced calcium or calmodulin levels decreased colocalization of MyoIIA and F-actin at the plasma membrane. While calcium alone can translocate MyoIIA it did not stimulate F-actin accumulation at the plasma membrane. Taken together, we established that while MyoIIA activity is required for F-actin localization at the plasma membrane, it alone is insufficient to localize F-actin to the plasma membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Genetically engineered human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been proposed as a source for transplantation therapies and are rapidly becoming valuable tools for human disease modeling. However, many applications are limited due to the lack of robust differentiation paradigms that allow for the isolation of defined functional tissues. Here, using an endogenous LGR5-GFP reporter, we derived adult stem cells from hPSCs that gave rise to functional human intestinal tissue comprising all major cell types of the intestine. Histological and functional analyses revealed that such human organoid cultures could be derived with high purity and with a composition and morphology similar to those of cultures obtained from human biopsies. Importantly, hPSC-derived organoids responded to the canonical signaling pathways that control self-renewal and differentiation in the adult human intestinal stem cell compartment. This adult stem cell system provides a platform for studying human intestinal disease in vitro using genetically engineered hPSCs.

Traction force microscopy in rapidly moving cells reveals separate roles for ROCK and MLCK in the mechanics of retraction,

Abstract: Retraction is a major rate-limiting step in cell motility, particularly in slow moving cell types that form large stable adhesions. Myosin II dependent contractile forces are thought to facilitate detachment by physically pulling up the rear edge. However, retraction can occur in the absence of myosin II activity in cell types that form small labile adhesions. To investigate the role of contractile force generation in retraction, we performed traction force microscopy during the movement of fish epithelial keratocytes. By correlating changes in local traction stress at the rear with the area retracted, we identified four distinct modes of retraction. “Recoil” retractions are preceded by a rise in local traction stress, while rear edge is temporarily stuck, followed by a sharp drop in traction stress upon detachment. This retraction type was most common in cells generating high average traction stress. In “pull” type retractions local traction stress and area retracted increase concomitantly. This was the predominant type of retraction in keratocytes and was observed mostly in cells generating low average traction stress. “Continuous” type retractions occur without any detectable change in traction stress, and are seen in cells generating low average traction stress. In contrast, to many other cell types, “release” type retractions occur in keratocytes following a decrease in local traction stress. Our identification of distinct modes of retraction suggests that contractile forces may play different roles in detachment that are related to rear adhesion strength. To determine how the regulation of contractility via MLCK or Rho kinase contributes to the mechanics of detachment, inhibitors were used to block or augment these pathways. Modulation of MLCK activity led to the most rapid change in local traction stress suggesting its importance in regulating attachment strength. Surprisingly, Rho kinase was not required for detachment, but was essential for localizing retraction to the rear. We suggest that in keratocytes MLCK and Rho kinase play distinct, complementary roles in the respective temporal and spatial control of rear detachment that is essential for maintaining rapid motility.

Abstract: Recombinant chimeras of small heat shock proteins (sHsp) HspB1, HspB5, and HspB6 containing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) attached to their C-terminal ends were constructed and purified. Some properties of these chimeras were compared with the corresponding properties of the same chimeras containing EYFP attached to the N-terminal end of sHsp. The C-terminal fluorescent chimeras of HspB1 and HspB5 tend to aggregate and form a heterogeneous mixture of oligomers. The apparent molecular weight of the largest C-terminal chimeric oligomers was higher than that of the corresponding N-terminal chimeras or of the wild-type proteins; however, both homooligomers of N-terminal chimeras and homooligomers of C-terminal chimeras contained fewer subunits than the wild-type HspB1 or HspB5. Both N-terminal and C-terminal chimeras of HspB6 form small oligomers with an apparent molecular weight of 73–84 kDa. The C-terminal chimeras exchange their subunits with homologous wild-type proteins. Heterooligomers formed by the wild-type HspB1 (or HspB5) and the C-terminal chimeras of HspB6 differ in size and composition from heterooligomers formed by the corresponding wild-type proteins. As a rule, the N-terminal chimeras possess similar or slightly higher chaperone-like activity than the corresponding wild-type proteins, whereas the C-terminal chimeras always have a lower chaperone-like activity than the wild-type proteins. It is concluded that attachment of EYFP to either N-terminal or C-terminal ends of sHsp affects their oligomeric structure, their ability to form heterooligomers, and their chaperone-like activity. Therefore, the data obtained with fluorescent chimeras of sHsp expressed in the cell should be interpreted with caution.

Abstract: Summary
We investigated the homeostatic behavior of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) temporally defined according to their divisional histories using an HSPC-specific GFP label-retaining system. We show that homeostatic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lose repopulating potential after limited cell divisions. Once HSCs exit dormancy and accrue divisions, they also progressively lose the ability to return to G0 and functional activities associated with quiescent HSCs. In addition, dormant HSPCs phenotypically defined as multipotent progenitor cells display robust stem cell activity upon transplantation, suggesting that temporal quiescence is a greater indicator of function than cell-surface phenotype. Our studies suggest that once homeostatic HSCs leave dormancy, they are slated for extinction. They self-renew phenotypically, but they lose self-renewal activity. As such, they question self-renewal as a characteristic of homeostatic, nonperturbed HSCs in contrast to self-renewal demonstrated under stress conditions.

Abstract: Epithelial scattering occurs when cells disassemble cell–cell junctions, allowing individual epithelial cells to act in a solitary manner. Epithelial scattering occurs frequently in development, where it accompanies epithelial–mesenchymal transitions and is required for individual cells to migrate and invade. While migration and invasion have received extensive research focus, how cell–cell junctions are detached remains poorly understood. An open debate has been whether disruption of cell–cell interactions occurs by remodeling of cell–cell adhesions, increased traction forces through cell substrate adhesions, or some combination of both processes. Here we seek to examine how changes in adhesion and contractility are coupled to drive detachment of individual epithelial cells during hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor-induced EMT. We find that HGF signaling does not alter the strength of cell–cell adhesion between cells in suspension, suggesting that changes in cell–cell adhesion strength might not accompany epithelial scattering. Instead, cell–substrate adhesion seems to play a bigger role, as cell–substrate adhesions are stronger in cells treated with HGF and since rapid scattering in cells treated with HGF and TGFβ is associated with a dramatic increase in focal adhesions. Increases in the pliability of the substratum, reducing cells ability to generate traction on the substrate, alter cells׳ ability to scatter. Further consistent with changes in substrate adhesion being required for cell–cell detachment during EMT, scattering is impaired in cells expressing both active and inactive RhoA mutants, though in different ways. In addition to its roles in driving assembly of both stress fibers and focal adhesions, RhoA also generates myosin-based contractility in cells. We therefore sought to examine how RhoA-dependent contractility contributes to cell–cell detachment. Inhibition of Rho kinase or myosin II induces the same effect on cells, namely an inhibition of cell scattering following HGF treatment. Interestingly, restoration of myosin-based contractility in blebbistatin-treated cells results in cell scattering, including global actin rearrangements. Scattering is reminiscent of HGF-induced epithelial scattering without a concomitant increase in cell migration or decrease in adhesion strength. This scattering is dependent on RhoA, as blebbistatin-induced scattering is reduced in cells expressing dominant-negative RhoA mutants. This suggests that induction of myosin-based cellular contractility may be sufficient for cell–cell detachment during epithelial scattering.

Abstract: The cytokine interferon-α (IFNα) belongs to the group of type I interferons already used in cancer therapy. This drug possesses radio- and chemo-sensitizing, and shows anti-angiogenic properties. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a unique population of tumor cells that initiate secondary tumors, and are responsible for metastasis formation. Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have an especially poor prognosis, with 5-year survival rates of only ~1% and median survival of 4–6 months. PDAC is characterized by the presence of CSC. In this work we demonstrate for the first time that IFNα up-regulates the expression of the CSC markers CD24, CD44 and CD133 in in vitro and in vivo models of PDAC. We showed the IFNα effects on the migration and invasion of PDAC cells, which is associated with the level of the CSC marker expression. In vivo, this drug inhibits tumor growth but promotes metastasis formation in the early stage of tumor growth. We propose that IFNα may enhance the enrichment of CSC in PDAC tumors. Additionally we also suggest that in combination therapy of solid tumors with IFNα, this drug should be given to patients prior to chemotherapy to achieve the CSC activation.

Abstract: Circulating leukocytes can be used as an effective model to understand the heat stress response of different cattle types and buffaloes. This investigation aimed to determine the temporal profile of HSPs (HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90) expression in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of Murrah buffaloes, Holstein–Friesian (HF), and Sahiwal cows in response to sublethal heat shock at 42 °C. The viability data indicated HF PBMCs to be the most affected to the heat shock, whereas Sahiwal PBMCs were least affected, indicating its better survivability during the heat stress condition. The qRT-PCR expression data showed significant increase in mRNA expression of the analyzed HSPs genes after heat stimuli to the PBMCs under in vitro condition. In each case, the HSPs were most upregulated at 2 h after the heat stress. Among the HSPs, HSP70 was relatively more expressed followed by HSP60 indicating the action of molecular chaperones to stabilize the native conformation of proteins. However, PBMCs from different cattle types and buffaloes showed difference in the extent of transcriptional response. The level of expression of HSPs throughout the time period of heat stress was highest in buffaloes, followed by HF and Sahiwal cows. The higher abundance of HSP70 mRNA at each time point after heat stress showed prolonged effect of heat stress in HF PBMCs. The data presented here provided initial evidence of transcriptional differences in PBMCs of different cattle types and buffaloes and warrant further research.

Abstract: In mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the integrity of the blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB), formed by tight junctions (TJs) between adjacent microvascular endothelial cells near the basement membrane of capillaries and the accessory structures, is important for relatively independent activities of the cellular constituents inside the spinal cord. The barrier function of the BSCB are tightly regulated and coordinated by a variety of physiological or pathological factors, similar with but not quite the same as its counterpart, the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Herein, angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), an identified ligand of the endothelium-specific tyrosine kinase receptor Tie-2, was verified to regulate barrier functions, including permeability, junction protein interactions and F-actin organization, in cultured spinal cord microvascular endothelial cells (SCMEC) of rat through the activity of Akt. Besides, these roles of Ang1 in the BSCB in vitro were found to be accompanied with an increasing expression of epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8), an F-actin bundling protein. Furthermore, the silencing of Eps8 by lentiviral shRNA resulted in an antagonistic effect vs. Ang1 on the endothelial barrier function of SCMEC. In summary, the Ang1–Akt pathway serves as a regulator in the barrier function modulation of SCMEC via the actin-binding protein Eps8.

Abstract: Two distinct types of embryonic pluripotent stem cells can be established from either the inner cell mass (ICM) of preimplantation blastocyst (leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-dependent embryonic stem cell, ESC, called naive state) or the epiblast of postimplantation fetuses (fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)-dependent epiblast stem cells, EpiSC, called primed state). Here, we report that naive pluripotent stem cell was established from the ICM, but maintained its self-renewal by treatment with FGF2 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) when they were exposed FGF2 during establishment. This cell line is competent to contribute to chimeric animals, including germ cells, at high efficiency. The ERK1/2, SMAD2/3, and JAK/STAT3 pathways are essential to maintain self-renewal. Inhibition of ERK1/2 or SMAD2/3 initiates transition to a naive state ESC-like state, whereas inhibition of JAK/STAT3 promotes a primed EpiSC-like character. Our present results could provide novel insights into understanding the growth factor environment and ICM plasticity, and mechanisms which orchestrate the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells and the capacity for chimeric contributions.

Abstract: In vivo and in vitro effects of TIS21 gene on the mature T cell activation and antitumor activities were explored by employing MO5 melanoma orthograft and splenocytes isolated from the TIS21-knockout (KO)22KO: TIS21 gene homozygote knockout. mice. Proliferation and survival of mature T cells were significantly increased in the KO than the wild type (WT)33WT: TIS21 gene wild type. cells, indicating that TIS21 inhibits the rate of mature T cell proliferation and its survival. In MO5 melanoma orthograft model, the KO mice recruited much more CD8+ T cells into the tumors at around day 14 after tumor cell injection along with reduced tumor volumes compared with the WT. The increased frequency of granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells in splenocytes of the KO mice compared with the WT may account for antitumor-immunity of TIS21 gene in the melanoma orthograft. In contrast, reduced frequencies of CD107a+ CD8+ T cells in the splenocytes of KO mice may affect the loss of CD8+ T cell infiltration in the orthograft at around day 19. These results indicate that TIS21 exhibits antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in mature T cells, and differentially affects the frequencies of granzyme B+ CD8+ T-cells and CD107a+ CD8+ T-cells, thus transiently regulating in vivo anti-tumor immunity.

Abstract: Stem cells in adult organism are responsible for cell turnover and tissue regeneration. The study of stem cell stress response contributes to our knowledge on the mechanisms of damaged tissue repair. Previously, we demonstrated that sublethal heat shock (HS) induced apoptosis in human embryonic stem cells. This study aimed to investigate HS response of human adult stem cells. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cultivated in vitro were challenged with sublethal HS. It was found that sublethal HS did not affect the cell viability assessed by annexin V/propidium staining. However, MSCs subjected to severe HS exhibited features of stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS): irreversible cell cycle arrest, altered morphology, increased expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, and induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 protein. High level of Hsp70 accumulation induced by sublethal HS did not return to the basal level, at least, after 72 h of the cell recovery when most cells exhibited SIPS hallmarks. MSCs survived sublethal HS, and resumed proliferation sustained the properties of parental MSCs: diploid karyotype, replicative senescence, expression of the cell surface markers, and capacity for multilineage differentiation. Our results showed for the first time that in human MSCs, sublethal HS induced premature senescence rather than apoptosis or necrosis. MSC progeny that survived sublethal HS manifested stem cell properties of the parental cells: limited replicative life span and multilineage capacity.

Abstract: Previous studies demonstrated that androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the male-dominant diseases. Glucose-regulated protein 78kDa (GRP78/Bip), which has a role in cancer development, is one of the androgen response genes in prostate cell lines. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of AR on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress signaling in human hepatoma. AR and GRP78 expressions were examined in human liver tissue panels. Human hepatoma cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA targeting AR and cells over-expressing AR were generated. The expressions of ER-stress molecules and AR were measured by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. The effect of AR on ER-stress responsive gene expression was examined by reporter assay. Strong positive correlation between AR mRNA and GRP78 mRNA was observed in stage I/II-HCCs. AR enhanced ER-stress responsive element activities and GRP78 expression, and regulated ER-stress response in hepatocytes. Sorafenib strongly induced significant apoptosis in HepG2 cells by the inhibition of AR and inhibition of the downstream GRP78. AR seems a co-regulator of GRP78 especially in earlier-stage HCC. AR plays a critical role in controlling ER-stress, providing new therapeutic options against HCC.

Abstract: Summary
The microenvironment is a critical mediator of stem cell survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The majority of preclinical studies involving transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into the CNS have focused on injured or degenerating microenvironments, leaving a dearth of information as to how NSCs differentially respond to intact versus damaged CNS. Furthermore, single, terminal histological endpoints predominate, providing limited insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of NSC engraftment and migration. We investigated the early and long-term engraftment dynamics of human CNS stem cells propagated as neurospheres (hCNS-SCns) following transplantation into uninjured versus subacutely injured spinal cords of immunodeficient NOD-scid mice. We stereologically quantified engraftment, survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation at 1, 7, 14, 28, and 98 days posttransplantation, and identified injury-dependent alterations. Notably, the injured microenvironment decreased hCNS-SCns survival, delayed and altered the location of proliferation, influenced both total and fate-specific migration, and promoted oligodendrocyte maturation.

Abstract: Metallothioneins (MTs) are a family of low molecular weight, cysteine-rich, metal-binding proteins that have a wide range of functions in cellular homeostasis and immunity. MTs can be induced by a variety of conditions including metals, glucocorticoids, endotoxin, acute phase cytokines, stress, and irradiation. In addition to their important immunomodulatory functions, MTs can protect essential cellular compartments from toxicants, serve as a reservoir of essential heavy metals, and regulate cellular redox potential. Many of the roles of MTs in the neuroinflammation, intestinal inflammation, and stress response have been investigated and were the subject of a session at the 6th International Congress on Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine in Sheffield, UK. Like the rest of the cell stress response, there are therapeutic opportunities that arise from an understanding of MTs, and these proteins also provide potential insights into the world of the heat shock protein.
