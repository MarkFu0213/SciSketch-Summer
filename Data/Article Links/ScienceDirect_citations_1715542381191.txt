Abstract: Summary
A-to-I RNA editing, catalyzed by ADAR proteins, is widespread in eukaryotic transcriptomes. Studies showed that, in C. elegans, ADR-2 can actively deaminate dsRNA, whereas ADR-1 cannot. Therefore, we set out to study the effect of each of the ADAR genes on the RNA editing process. We performed comprehensive phenotypic, transcriptomics, proteomics, and RNA binding screens on worms mutated in a single ADAR gene. We found that ADR-1 mutants exhibit more-severe phenotypes than ADR-2, and some of them are a result of non-editing functions of ADR-1. We also show that ADR-1 significantly binds edited genes and regulates mRNA expression, whereas the effect on protein levels is minor. In addition, ADR-1 primarily promotes editing by ADR-2 at the L4 stage of development. Our results suggest that ADR-1 has a significant role in the RNA editing process and in altering editing levels that affect RNA expression; loss of ADR-1 results in severe phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) affects gene expression and polyadenylation site (PAS) choice. Here, we report that the CPA and termination factor PCF11 modulates gene expression on the basis of gene size. Although downregulation of PCF11 leads to inhibition of short gene expression, long genes are upregulated because of suppressed intronic polyadenylation (IPA) enriched in large introns. We show that this regulatory scheme, named PCF11-mediated expression regulation through IPA (PEIPA), takes place in cell differentiation, during which downregulation of PCF11 is coupled with upregulation of long genes with functions in cell morphology, adhesion, and migration. PEIPA targets distinct gene sets in different cell contexts with similar rules. Furthermore, PCF11 is autoregulated through a conserved IPA site, the removal of which leads to global activation of PASs close to gene promotors. Therefore, PCF11 uses distinct mechanisms to regulate genes of different sizes, and its autoregulation maintains homeostasis of PAS usage in the cell.

Abstract: Summary
The nature of obesity-associated islet inflammation and its impact on β cell abnormalities remains poorly defined. Here, we explore immune cell components of islet inflammation and define their roles in regulating β cell function and proliferation. Islet inflammation in obese mice is dominated by macrophages. We identify two islet-resident macrophage populations, characterized by their anatomical distributions, distinct phenotypes, and functional properties. Obesity induces the local expansion of resident intra-islet macrophages, independent of recruitment from circulating monocytes. Functionally, intra-islet macrophages impair β cell function in a cell-cell contact-dependent manner. Increased engulfment of β cell insulin secretory granules by intra-islet macrophages in obese mice may contribute to restricting insulin secretion. In contrast, both intra- and peri-islet macrophage populations from obese mice promote β cell proliferation in a PDGFR signaling-dependent manner. Together, these data define distinct roles and mechanisms for islet macrophages in the regulation of islet β cells.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the human central and peripheral nervous systems. n-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22: 6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as well as apelin have anti-inflammatory effects in various cells. At the same time, apelin has anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects. The study was conducted to determine the effect of DHA on the distribution of apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) in the central nervous system in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model. DHA treatment decreased the return time and total down time in the Parkinson group which were measured by pole test. Besides, the ambulatory activity, distance and total locomotor activity were increased by DHA in the PD model of animals. The time mice remained on the rotating rod mile was also significantly increased by DHA treatment in MPTP injected animals. The apelin expression in the pons of mice in the Parkinson, DHA and Parkinson + DHA groups were lower compared to the Control group. When apelin and apelin receptor expressions in cerebrum were examined, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. When apelin receptor expression in cerebellum was examined, the difference between the Control and Parkinson + DHA, Parkinson and Parkinson + DHA, DHA and Parkinson + DHA groups were statistically significant. Apelin receptor expressions in pons of the Parkinson, DHA and Parkinson + DHA groups were lower compared to the Control group. Apelin protein levels of cerebellum and pons were found to be decreased in DHA group compare with Control group. In conclusion; DHA has been implicated in the expression of the apelin receptor and has reduced the expression of APJ receptor.

Abstract: Summary
Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) enzymes (Tet1/2/3) mediate 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylation, which can facilitate DNA demethylation and thereby impact gene expression. Studied mostly for how mutant isoforms impact cancer, the normal roles for Tet enzymes during organogenesis are largely unknown. By analyzing compound mutant zebrafish, we discovered a requirement for Tet2/3 activity in the embryonic heart for recruitment of epicardial progenitors, associated with development of the atrial-ventricular canal (AVC). Through a combination of methylation, hydroxymethylation, and transcript profiling, the genes encoding the activin A subunit Inhbaa (in endocardium) and Sox9b (in myocardium) were implicated as demethylation targets of Tet2/3 and critical for organization of AVC-localized extracellular matrix (ECM), facilitating migration of epicardial progenitors onto the developing heart tube. This study elucidates essential DNA demethylation modifications that govern gene expression changes during cardiac development with striking temporal and lineage specificities, highlighting complex interactions in multiple cell populations during development of the vertebrate heart.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-based studies of human ribonucleases traditionally rely on methods that deplete proteins slowly. We engineered cells in which the 3′→5′ exoribonucleases of the exosome complex, DIS3 and EXOSC10, can be rapidly eliminated to assess their immediate roles in nuclear RNA biology. The loss of DIS3 has the greatest impact, causing the substantial accumulation of thousands of transcripts within 60 min. These transcripts include enhancer RNAs, promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), and products of premature cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA). These transcripts are unaffected by the rapid loss of EXOSC10, suggesting that they are rarely targeted to it. More direct detection of EXOSC10-bound transcripts revealed its substrates to prominently include short 3′ extended ribosomal and small nucleolar RNAs. Finally, the 5′→3′ exoribonuclease, XRN2, has little activity on exosome substrates, but its elimination uncovers different mechanisms for the early termination of transcription from protein-coding gene promoters.

Abstract: Summary
Progression of DNA replication depends on the ability of the replisome complex to overcome nucleoprotein barriers. During eukaryotic replication, the CMG helicase translocates along the leading-strand template and unwinds the DNA double helix. While proteins bound to the leading-strand template efficiently block the helicase, the impact of lagging-strand protein obstacles on helicase translocation and replisome progression remains controversial. Here, we show that CMG and replisome progressions are impaired when proteins crosslinked to the lagging-strand template enhance the stability of duplex DNA. In contrast, proteins that exclusively interact with the lagging-strand template influence neither the translocation of isolated CMG nor replisome progression in Xenopus egg extracts. Our data imply that CMG completely excludes the lagging-strand template from the helicase central channel while unwinding DNA at the replication fork, which clarifies how two CMG helicases could freely cross one another during replication initiation and termination.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancers are ubiquitous and critical gene-regulatory elements. However, quantitative understanding of the role of DNA looping in the regulation of enhancer action and specificity is limited. We used the Escherichia coli NtrC enhancer-σ54 promoter system as an in vivo model, finding that NtrC activation is highly sensitive to the enhancer-promoter (E-P) distance in the 300–6,000 bp range. DNA loops formed by Lac repressor were able to strongly regulate enhancer action either positively or negatively, recapitulating promoter targeting and insulation. A single LacI loop combining targeting and insulation produced a strong shift in specificity for enhancer choice between two σ54 promoters. A combined kinetic-thermodynamic model was used to quantify the effect of DNA-looping interactions on promoter activity and revealed that sensitivity to E-P distance and to control by other loops is itself dependent on enhancer and promoter parameters that may be subject to regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms that pattern and maintain dendritic arbors are key to understanding the principles that govern nervous system assembly. The activity of presynaptic axons has long been known to shape dendrites, but activity-independent functions of axons in this process have remained elusive. Here, we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the axons of the ALA neuron control guidance and extension of the 1° dendrites of PVD somatosensory neurons independently of ALA activity. PVD 1° dendrites mimic ALA axon guidance defects in loss-of-function mutants for the extracellular matrix molecule MIG-6/Papilin or the UNC-6/Netrin pathway, suggesting that axon-dendrite adhesion is important for dendrite formation. We found that the SAX-7/L1CAM cell adhesion molecule engages in distinct molecular mechanisms to mediate extensions of PVD 1° dendrites and maintain the ALA-PVD axon-dendritic fascicle, respectively. Thus, axons can serve as critical scaffolds to pattern and maintain dendrites through contact-dependent but activity-independent mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
As integral regulators in plant development and stress response, microRNAs (miRNAs) themselves need to be tightly regulated. Here, we show that tocopherols (vitamin E), lipid-soluble antioxidants synthesized from tyrosine in chloroplasts, positively regulate the biogenesis of miRNAs. Tocopherols are required for the accumulation of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP), a retrograde inhibitor of the nuclear exoribonucleases (XRN), which may protect primary miRNAs from being degraded and promote mature miRNA production. Such regulation is involved in heat-induced accumulation of miR398 and plant acquisition of heat tolerance. Our study reveals a chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling mechanism that favors miRNA biogenesis under heat and possibly other environmental perturbations.

Abstract: Summary
The neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau, MAPT, is central to the pathogenesis of many dementias. Autosomal-dominant mutations in MAPT cause inherited frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. Using human stem cell models of FTD due to MAPT mutations, we find that tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and mislocalizes to cell bodies and dendrites in cortical neurons, recapitulating a key early event in FTD. Mislocalized tau in the cell body leads to abnormal microtubule movements in FTD-MAPT neurons that grossly deform the nuclear membrane. This results in defective nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is corrected by microtubule depolymerization. Neurons in the post-mortem human FTD-MAPT cortex have a high incidence of nuclear invaginations, indicating that tau-mediated nuclear membrane dysfunction is an important pathogenic process in FTD. Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport in FTD point to important commonalities in the pathogenic mechanisms of tau-mediated dementias and ALS-FTD due to TDP-43 and C9orf72 mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of cell-surface markers specific to human pancreatic β cells would allow in vivo analysis and imaging. Here we introduce a biomarker, ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-3 (NTPDase3), that is expressed on the cell surface of essentially all adult human β cells, including those from individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. NTPDase3 is expressed dynamically during postnatal human pancreas development, appearing first in acinar cells at birth, but several months later its expression declines in acinar cells while concurrently emerging in islet β cells. Given its specificity and membrane localization, we utilized an NTPDase3 antibody for purification of live human β cells as confirmed by transcriptional profiling, and, in addition, for in vivo imaging of transplanted human β cells. Thus, NTPDase3 is a cell-surface biomarker of adult human β cells, and the antibody directed to this protein should be a useful new reagent for β cell sorting, in vivo imaging, and targeting.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 encodes four “accessory proteins” (Vif, Vpr, Vpu, and Nef), dispensable for viral replication in vitro but essential for viral pathogenesis in vivo. Well characterized cellular targets have been associated with Vif, Vpu, and Nef, which counteract host restriction and promote viral replication. Conversely, although several substrates of Vpr have been described, their biological significance remains unclear. Here, we use complementary unbiased mass spectrometry-based approaches to demonstrate that Vpr is both necessary and sufficient for the DCAF1/DDB1/CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated degradation of at least 38 cellular proteins, causing systems-level changes to the cellular proteome. We therefore propose that promiscuous targeting of multiple host factors underpins complex Vpr-dependent cellular phenotypes and validate this in the case of G2/M cell cycle arrest. Our model explains how Vpr modulates so many cell biological processes and why the functional consequences of previously described Vpr targets, identified and studied in isolation, have proved elusive.

Abstract: Summary
Self-renewal and pluripotency of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) state are established and maintained by multiple regulatory networks that comprise transcription factors and epigenetic regulators. While much has been learned regarding transcription factors, the function of epigenetic regulators in these networks is less well defined. We conducted a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated loss-of-function genetic screen that identified two epigenetic regulators, TAF5L and TAF6L, components or co-activators of the GNAT-HAT complexes for the mouse ESC (mESC) state. Detailed molecular studies demonstrate that TAF5L/TAF6L transcriptionally activate c-Myc and Oct4 and their corresponding MYC and CORE regulatory networks. Besides, TAF5L/TAF6L predominantly regulate their target genes through H3K9ac deposition and c-MYC recruitment that eventually activate the MYC regulatory network for self-renewal of mESCs. Thus, our findings uncover a role of TAF5L/TAF6L in directing the MYC regulatory network that orchestrates gene expression programs to control self-renewal for the maintenance of mESC state.

Abstract: Summary
Selective autophagy recycles damaged organelles and clears intracellular pathogens to prevent their aberrant accumulation. How ULK1 kinase is targeted and activated during selective autophagic events remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used chemically inducible dimerization (CID) assays in tandem with CRISPR KO lines to systematically analyze the molecular basis of selective autophagosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that ectopic placement of NDP52 on mitochondria or peroxisomes is sufficient to initiate selective autophagy by focally localizing and activating the ULK1 complex. The capability of NDP52 to induce mitophagy is dependent on its interaction with the FIP200/ULK1 complex, which is facilitated by TBK1. Ectopically tethering ULK1 to cargo bypasses the requirement for autophagy receptors and TBK1. Focal activation of ULK1 occurs independently of AMPK and mTOR. Our findings provide a parsimonious model of selective autophagy, which highlights the coordination of ULK1 complex localization by autophagy receptors and TBK1 as principal drivers of targeted autophagosome biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful chromosome segregation relies on the ability of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to delay anaphase onset until chromosomes are attached to the mitotic spindle via their kinetochores. MPS1 kinase is recruited to kinetochores to initiate SAC signaling and is removed from kinetochores once stable microtubule attachments have been formed to allow normal mitotic progression. Here, we show that a helical fragment within the kinetochore-targeting N-terminal extension (NTE) module of MPS1 is required for interactions with kinetochores and forms intramolecular interactions with its adjacent tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. Bypassing this NTE-TPR interaction results in high MPS1 levels at kinetochores due to loss of regulatory input into MPS1 localization, inefficient MPS1 delocalization upon microtubule attachment, and SAC silencing defects. These results show that SAC responsiveness to attachments relies on regulated intramolecular interactions in MPS1 and highlight the sensitivity of mitosis to perturbations in the dynamics of the MPS1-NDC80-C interactions.

Abstract: Osteochondral tissue has a complex layered structure that is not self-repairing after a cartilage defect. Therefore, constructing a biomimetic gradient scaffold that meets the specific structural requirements of osteochondral tissue is a major challenge in the field of cartilage tissue engineering. In this study, chitosan/Sodium β-glycerophosphate/Gelatin (Cs/GP/Gel) biomimetic gradient scaffolds were prepared by regulating the mass ratio of single layer raw materials. The same ratio of Cs/GP/Gel hybrid scaffold material was used as the control. Physical properties such as water absorption, porosity and the degradation rate of the material were compared to optimize the proportion of scaffold materials. P3 Bone Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BMSCs) were inoculated on the gradient and the control scaffolds to investigate its biocompatibility. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results show that 3:1:2, 6:1:3.5, 9:1:5, 12:1:6.5, 15:1:8 Cs/GP/Gel gradient scaffolds had excellent three-dimensional porous structures. Channels were also shown to have been interconnected, and the walls of the pores were folded. In the longitudinal dimension, gradient scaffolds had an obvious stratified structure and pore gradient gradualism, that effectively simulated the natural physiological stratified structure of real cartilage. The diameter of the pores in the control scaffold was uniform and without any pore gradient. Gradient scaffolds had good water absorption (584.24 ± 3.79˜677.47 ± 1.70%), porosity (86.34 ± 5.10˜95.20 ± 2.86%) and degradation (86.09 ± 2.46˜92.48 ± 3.86%). After considering the physical properties assessed, the Cs/GP/Gel gradient scaffold with a ratio of 9:1:5 was found to be the most suitable material to support osteochondral tissue. BMSCs were subsequently inoculated on the proportional gradient and hybrid scaffolds culture. These cells survived, distributed and extended well on the gradient and hybrid scaffold material. The biomimetic gradient scaffold designed and prepared in this study provides an important foundation for the development of new gradient composite biomedical materials for osteochondral repair.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription of the proto-oncogene SPHK1 is regulated by KHPS1, an antisense RNA that activates SPHK1 expression by forming a triple-helical RNA-DNA-DNA structure at the SPHK1 enhancer. Triplex-mediated tethering of KHPS1 to its target gene is required for recruitment of E2F1 and p300 and transcription of the RNA derived from the SPHK1 enhancer (eRNA-Sphk1). eRNA-Sphk1 evicts CTCF, which insulates the enhancer from the SPHK1 promoter, thus facilitating SPHK1 expression. Genomic deletion of the triplex-forming sequence attenuates SPHK1 expression, leading to decreased cell migration and invasion. Replacement of the triplex-forming region (TFR) of KHPS1 by the TFR of the lncRNA MEG3 tethers KHPS1 to the MEG3 target gene TGFBR1, underscoring the interchangeability and anchoring function of sequences involved in triplex formation. Altogether, the results reveal a triplex-driven feedforward mechanism involving lncRNA-dependent induction of eRNA, which enhances expression of specific target genes.

Abstract: Summary
Filamentous aggregates (fibrils) are regarded as the final stage in the assembly of amyloidogenic proteins and are formed in many neurodegenerative diseases. Accumulation of aggregates occurs as a result of an imbalance between their formation and removal. Here we use single-aggregate imaging to show that large fibrils assembled from full-length tau are substrates of the 26S proteasome holoenzyme, which fragments them into small aggregates. Interestingly, although degradation of monomeric tau is not inhibited by adenosine 5’-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS), fibril fragmentation is predominantly dependent on the ATPase activity of the proteasome. The proteasome holoenzyme also targets fibrils assembled from α-synuclein, suggesting that its fibril-fragmenting function may be a general mechanism. The fragmented species produced by the proteasome shows significant toxicity to human cell lines compared with intact fibrils. Together, our results indicate that the proteasome holoenzyme possesses a fragmentation function that disassembles large fibrils into smaller and more cytotoxic species.

Abstract: Summary
In the mouse retina, more than 30 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) subtypes have been classified based on a combined metric of morphological and functional characteristics. RGCs arise from a common pool of retinal progenitor cells during embryonic stages and differentiate into mature subtypes in adult retinas. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling formation and maturation of such remarkable cellular diversity remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that T-box transcription factor T-brain 1 (Tbr1) is expressed in two groups of morphologically and functionally distinct RGCs: the orientation-selective J-RGCs and a group of OFF-sustained RGCs with symmetrical dendritic arbors. When Tbr1 is genetically ablated during retinal development, these two RGC groups cannot develop. Ectopically expressing Tbr1 in M4 ipRGCs during development alters dendritic branching and density but not the inner plexiform layer stratification level. Our data indicate that Tbr1 plays critical roles in regulating the formation and dendritic morphogenesis of specific RGC types.

Abstract: Synovial sarcoma (SS) is an aggressive subgroup of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) with high grade and high risk of metastasis. However, there are no systemic therapies available that target SS. Therefore, transformative therapy is needed for SS. To establish a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model, a patient tumor with high grade SS from a lower extremity was grown orthotopically in the right biceps femoris muscle of mice. To test the efficacy of drugs, the PDOX models were randomized into five groups: Group 1 (G1), control-without treatment; Group 2 (G2), doxorubicin (DOX); Group 3 (G3), temozolomide (TEM); Group 4 (G4), gemcitabine (GEM) combined with docetaxel (DOC); and Group 5 (G5), pazopanib (PAZ). Tumor size and body weight were measured twice a week for each treatment group. A significant growth inhibition was found on day 14 in each treatment group compared to the untreated control, except for DOX. However, PAZ was significantly more effective than both TEM and GEM + DOC. In addition, PAZ significantly regressed the tumor volume on day 14 compared to day 0. No change was found in body weight on day 14 compared to day 0 in any treatment group. The present study demonstrated the precision of the SS PDOX models for individualizing SS therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Tight junctions contribute to epithelial barrier function by selectively regulating the quantity and type of molecules that cross the paracellular barrier. Experimental approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of tight junctions are typically global, tissue-scale measures. Here, we introduce Zinc-based Ultrasensitive Microscopic Barrier Assay (ZnUMBA), which we used in Xenopus laevis embryos to visualize short-lived, local breaches in epithelial barrier function. These breaches, or leaks, occur as cell boundaries elongate, correspond to visible breaks in the tight junction, and are followed by transient localized Rho activation, or Rho flares. We discovered that Rho flares restore barrier function by driving concentration of tight junction proteins through actin polymerization and ROCK-mediated localized contraction of the cell boundary. We conclude that Rho flares constitute a damage control mechanism that reinstates barrier function when tight junctions become locally compromised because of normally occurring changes in cell shape and tissue tension.

Abstract: Extracellular stimuli evoke a robust increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) throughout the cell to trigger various cellular responses, such as gene expression and apoptosis. This robust expansion of [Ca2+]c is called Ca2+ propagation. To date, it is thought that intracellular second messengers, such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and intracellular Ca2+, and clusters of IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) regulate Ca2+ propagation. However, little is known about how the elevation in the [Ca2+]c spreads throughout the cell, especially in non-polar cell, including HeLa cell. In this study, we developed a novel multi lines analysis tool. This tool revealed that the velocity of Ca2+ propagation was inconstant throughout cell and local concentration of intracellular Ca2+ did not contribute to the velocity of Ca2+ propagation. Our results suggest that intracellular Ca2+ propagation is not merely the result of diffusion of intracellular Ca2+, and that, on the contrary, intracellular Ca2+ propagation seems to be regulated by more complicated processes.

Abstract: Summary
Microprocessor, composed of DROSHA and its cofactor DGCR8, initiates microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis by processing the primary transcripts of miRNA (pri-miRNAs). Here we investigate the mechanism by which Microprocessor selects the cleavage site with single-nucleotide precision, which is crucial for the specificity and functionality of miRNAs. By testing ∼40,000 pri-miRNA variants, we find that for some pri-miRNAs the cleavage site is dictated mainly by the mGHG motif embedded in the lower stem region of pri-miRNA. Structural modeling and deep-sequencing-based complementation experiments show that the double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) of DROSHA recognizes mGHG to place the catalytic center in the appropriate position. The mGHG motif as well as the mGHG-recognizing residues in DROSHA dsRBD are conserved across eumetazoans, suggesting that this mechanism emerged in an early ancestor of the animal lineage. Our findings provide a basis for the understanding of miRNA biogenesis and rational design of accurate small-RNA-based gene silencing.

Abstract: Summary
Anxiety disorders are associated with body weight changes in humans. However, the mechanisms underlying anxiety-induced weight changes remain poorly understood. Using Emx1Cre/+ mice, we deleted the gene for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the cortex, hippocampus, and some amygdalar subregions. The resulting mutant mice displayed impaired GABAergic transmission and elevated anxiety. They were leaner when fed either a chow diet or a high-fat diet, owing to higher sympathetic activity, basal metabolic rate, brown adipocyte thermogenesis, and beige adipocyte formation, compared to control mice. BDNF re-expression in the amygdala rescued the anxiety and metabolic phenotypes in mutant mice. Conversely, anxiety induced by amygdala-specific Bdnf deletion or administration of an inverse GABAA receptor agonist increased energy expenditure. These results reveal that increased activities in anxiogenic circuits can reduce body weight by promoting adaptive thermogenesis and basal metabolism via the sympathetic nervous system and suggest that amygdalar GABAergic neurons are a link between anxiety and metabolic dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
We systematically investigated the landscape of tumor-suppressor gene (TSG) inactivation events in 33 cancer types by quantitatively measuring their global and local genomic features and their transcriptional and signaling footprints. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas data, we identified with high confidence 337 TSG × cancer events in 30 cancer types, of which 277 were unique events. The majority (91.0%) of these events had a significant downstream impact measured by reduced expression of the TSG itself (cis-effect), disturbance of the transcriptome (trans-effect), or combinatorial effects. Importantly, the transcriptomic changes associated with TSG inactivation events were stronger than the cancer lineage difference, and the same TSGs inactivated in different cancer types tended to cluster together. Several TSGs (e.g., RB1, TP53, and CDKN2A) involved in the regulation of the cell-cycle-formed clusters. Finally, we constructed subnetworks of the TSG × cancer inactivation events, including the local genes frequently disturbed upon the inactivation events.

Abstract: Summary
Several large-scale genome-wide association studies genetically linked IRGM to Crohn’s disease and other inflammatory disorders in which the IRGM appears to have a protective function. However, the mechanism by which IRGM accomplishes this anti-inflammatory role remains unclear. Here, we reveal that IRGM/Irgm1 is a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We show that IRGM expression, which is increased by PAMPs, DAMPs, and microbes, can suppress the pro-inflammatory responses provoked by the same stimuli. IRGM/Irgm1 negatively regulates IL-1β maturation by suppressing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mechanistically, we show that IRGM interacts with NLRP3 and ASC and hinders inflammasome assembly by blocking their oligomerization. Further, IRGM mediates selective autophagic degradation of NLRP3 and ASC. By suppressing inflammasome activation, IRGM/Irgm1 protects from pyroptosis and gut inflammation in a Crohn’s disease experimental mouse model. This study for the first time identifies the mechanism by which IRGM is protective against inflammatory disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) emerge from hemogenic endothelium (HE) within the ventral portion of the dorsal aorta during vertebrate development. In zebrafish, Notch signaling induces HE specification from posterior lateral plate mesoderm (PLPM) cells as they migrate over the ventral surface of the somite. During migration, PLPM cells make close contact with Notch-ligand-expressing somitic cells to acquire HE identity. Herein, we show in zebrafish that the small GTPase Rap1b regulates HSC development by potentiating Notch-mediated HE specification. PLPM cells migrate toward the midline along the somite boundary where fibronectin accumulates. Rap1b stimulates integrin β1 to enhance PLPM cell adhesion to fibronectin localized at the somite boundary. Rap1b-induced integrin-β1-mediated adhesion to fibronectin leads to the spreading of PLPM cells to facilitate their physical contact with the Notch-ligand-expressing somitic cells, thereby promoting Notch-mediated HE specification. Thus, we have revealed an unexpected role of Rap1-induced integrin-mediated cell adhesion in HSC development.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells without mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) do not form tumors unless they reconstitute oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by mitochondria acquired from host stroma. To understand why functional respiration is crucial for tumorigenesis, we used time-resolved analysis of tumor formation by mtDNA-depleted cells and genetic manipulations of OXPHOS. We show that pyrimidine biosynthesis dependent on respiration-linked dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is required to overcome cell-cycle arrest, while mitochondrial ATP generation is dispensable for tumorigenesis. Latent DHODH in mtDNA-deficient cells is fully activated with restoration of complex III/IV activity and coenzyme Q redox-cycling after mitochondrial transfer, or by introduction of an alternative oxidase. Further, deletion of DHODH interferes with tumor formation in cells with fully functional OXPHOS, while disruption of mitochondrial ATP synthase has little effect. Our results show that DHODH-driven pyrimidine biosynthesis is an essential pathway linking respiration to tumorigenesis, pointing to inhibitors of DHODH as potential anti-cancer agents.

Abstract: The regulatory role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) in both cancerous and noncancerous cells have been widely reported. This study aimed to evaluate the role of lncRNA GAS5 in heart failure caused by myocardial infarction. We reported that silence of lncRNA GAS5 attenuated hypoxia-triggered cell death, as cell viability was increased and apoptosis rate was decreased. This phenomenon was coupled with the down-regulated expression of p53, Bax and cleaved caspase-3, as well as the up-regulated expression of CyclinD1, CDK4 and Bcl-2. At the meantime, the expression of four heart failure-related miRNAs was altered when lncRNA GAS5 was silenced (miR-21 and miR-142-5p were up-regulated; miR-30b and miR-93 were down-regulated). RNA immunoprecipitation assay results showed that lncRNA GAS5 worked as a molecular sponge for miR-142-5p. More interestingly, the protective actions of lncRNA GAS5 silence on hypoxia-stimulated cells were attenuated by miR-142-5p suppression. Besides, TP53INP1 was a target gene for miR-142-5p. Silence of lncRNA GAS5 promoted the activation of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathways in a miR-142-5p-dependent manner. Collectively, this study demonstrated that silence of lncRNA GAS5 protected H9c2 cells against hypoxia-induced injury possibly via sponging miR-142-5p, functionally releasing TP53INP1 mRNA transcripts that are normally targeted by miR-142-5p.

Abstract: Summary
The classic view of nucleosome organization at active promoters is that two well-positioned nucleosomes flank a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR). However, this view has been recently disputed by contradictory reports as to whether wider (≳150 bp) NDRs instead contain unstable, micrococcal nuclease-sensitive (“fragile”) nucleosomal particles. To determine the composition of fragile particles, we introduce CUT&RUN.ChIP, in which targeted nuclease cleavage and release is followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We find that fragile particles represent the occupancy of the RSC (remodeling the structure of chromatin) nucleosome remodeling complex and RSC-bound, partially unwrapped nucleosomal intermediates. We also find that general regulatory factors (GRFs) bind to partially unwrapped nucleosomes at these promoters. We propose that RSC binding and its action cause nucleosomes to unravel, facilitate subsequent binding of GRFs, and constitute a dynamic cycle of nucleosome deposition and clearance at the subset of wide Pol II promoter NDRs.

Abstract: Summary
Spatial firing of hippocampal place cells varies depending on the animal’s behavior relative to its goals. Here, rats were trained to approach visually guided reward ports in a two-dimensional open field. Hippocampal place cells encoded two independent pieces of information, spatial representation and goal-directed representation, by amplifying firing rates within their place fields specifically while the animal was moving toward a specific goal location. Irrespective of running speed and direction, substantial place-selective firing was observed that sustained a basal spatial map independent of goal-directed signals. When animals were allowed to freely forage in the field, in-field firing rates similarly increased when the animals transiently ran toward remembered goal locations. Disruption of medial septal activity significantly decreased goal-directed firing while maintaining spatial representation patterns. The findings indicate that the integrated encoding of spatial and goal-directed signals by hippocampal circuits is crucial for flexible spatial navigation to a goal location.

Abstract: Summary
Biological systems must possess mechanisms that prevent inappropriate responses to spurious environmental inputs. Caenorhabditis elegans has two breakdown pathways for the short-chain fatty acid propionate: a canonical, vitamin B12-dependent pathway and a propionate shunt that is used when vitamin B12 levels are low. The shunt pathway is kept off when there is sufficient flux through the canonical pathway, likely to avoid generating shunt-specific toxic intermediates. Here, we discovered a transcriptional regulatory circuit that activates shunt gene expression upon propionate buildup. Nuclear hormone receptor 10 (NHR-10) and NHR-68 function together as a “persistence detector” in a type 1, coherent feed-forward loop with an AND-logic gate to delay shunt activation upon propionate accumulation and to avoid spurious shunt activation in response to a non-sustained pulse of propionate. Together, our findings identify a persistence detector in an animal, which transcriptionally rewires propionate metabolism to maintain homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have the worst prognosis and distant metastasis-free survival among all major subtypes of breast cancer. The poor clinical outlook is further exacerbated by a lack of effective targeted therapies for TNBC. Here we show that ectopic expression and therapeutic delivery of the secreted protein Tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen-like 1 (Tinagl1) suppresses TNBC progression and metastasis through direct binding to integrin α5β1, αvβ1, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and subsequent simultaneous inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and EGFR signaling pathways. Moreover, Tinagl1 protein level is associated with good prognosis and reversely correlates with FAK and EGFR activation status in TNBC. Our results suggest Tinagl1 as a candidate therapeutic agent for TNBC by dual inhibition of integrin/FAK and EGFR signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
High-throughput methodologies have enabled routine generation of RNA target sets and sequence motifs for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Nevertheless, quantitative approaches are needed to capture the landscape of RNA-RBP interactions responsible for cellular regulation. We have used the RNA-MaP platform to directly measure equilibrium binding for thousands of designed RNAs and to construct a predictive model for RNA recognition by the human Pumilio proteins PUM1 and PUM2. Despite prior findings of linear sequence motifs, our measurements revealed widespread residue flipping and instances of positional coupling. Application of our thermodynamic model to published in vivo crosslinking data reveals quantitative agreement between predicted affinities and in vivo occupancies. Our analyses suggest a thermodynamically driven, continuous Pumilio-binding landscape that is negligibly affected by RNA structure or kinetic factors, such as displacement by ribosomes. This work provides a quantitative foundation for dissecting the cellular behavior of RBPs and cellular features that impact their occupancies.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression, but their joint functions in coordinating cell fate decisions are poorly understood. Here we show that the expression and activity of the RBP TDP-43 and the long isoform of the lncRNA Neat1, the scaffold of the nuclear compartment “paraspeckles,” are reciprocal in pluripotent and differentiated cells because of their cross-regulation. In pluripotent cells, TDP-43 represses the formation of paraspeckles by enhancing the polyadenylated short isoform of Neat1. TDP-43 also promotes pluripotency by regulating alternative polyadenylation of transcripts encoding pluripotency factors, including Sox2, which partially protects its 3′ UTR from miR-21-mediated degradation. Conversely, paraspeckles sequester TDP-43 and other RBPs from mRNAs and promote exit from pluripotency and embryonic patterning in the mouse. We demonstrate that cross-regulation between TDP-43 and Neat1 is essential for their efficient regulation of a broad network of genes and, therefore, of pluripotency and differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Trophoblast stem (TS) cells are increasingly used as a model system for studying placentation and placental disorders. However, practical limitations of genetic manipulation have posed challenges for genetic analysis using TS cells. Here, we report the generation of mouse parthenogenetic haploid TS cells (haTSCs) and show that supplementation with FGF4 and inhibition of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) enable the maintenance of their haploidy and developmental potential. The resulting haTSCs have 20 chromosomes, exhibit typical expression features of TS cells, possess the multipotency to differentiate into specialized trophoblast cell types, and can chimerize E13.5 and term placentas. We also demonstrate the capability of the haTSCs to undergo genetic manipulation and facilitate genome-wide screening in the trophoblast lineage. We expect that haTSCs will offer a powerful tool for studying functional genomics and placental biology.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular recordings in vivo remains the best technique to link single-neuron electrical properties to network function. Yet existing methods are limited in accuracy, throughput, and duration, primarily via washout, membrane damage, and movement-induced failure. Here, we introduce flexible quartz nanopipettes (inner diameters of 10–25 nm and spring constant of ∼0.08 N/m) as nanoscale analogs of traditional glass microelectrodes. Nanopipettes enable stable intracellular recordings (seal resistances of 500 to ∼800 MΩ, 5 to ∼10 cells/nanopipette, and duration of ∼1 hr) in anaesthetized and awake head-restrained mice, exhibit minimal diffusional flux, and facilitate precise recording and stimulation. When combined with quantum-dot labels and microprisms, nanopipettes enable two-photon targeted electrophysiology from both somata and dendrites, and even paired recordings from neighboring neurons, while permitting simultaneous population imaging across cortical layers. We demonstrate the versatility of this method by recording from parvalbumin-positive (Pv) interneurons while imaging seizure propagation, and we find that Pv depolarization block coincides with epileptic spread. Flexible nanopipettes present a simple method to procure stable intracellular recordings in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome is the most abundant RNA-protein complex in a cell, and many copies of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) have to be maintained. However, arrays of tandemly repeated rDNA genes can lose the copies by intra-repeat recombination. Loss of the rDNA copies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is counteracted by gene amplification whereby the number of rDNA repeats stabilizes around 150 copies, suggesting the presence of a monitoring mechanism that counts and adjusts the number. Here, we report that, in response to rDNA copy loss, the upstream activating factor (UAF) for RNA polymerase I that transcribes the rDNA is released and directly binds to a RNA polymerase II-transcribed gene, SIR2, whose gene products silence rDNA recombination, to repress. We show that the amount of UAF determines the rDNA copy number that is stably maintained. UAF ensures rDNA production not only by rDNA transcription activation but also by its copy-number maintenance.

Multisite Phosphorylation of S6K1 Directs a Kinase Phospho-code that Determines Substrate Selection,

Abstract: Summary
Multisite phosphorylation of kinases can induce on-off or graded regulation of catalytic activity; however, its influence on substrate specificity remains unclear. Here, we show that multisite phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) alters target selection. Agonist-inducible phosphorylation of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) by S6K1 in monocytes and adipocytes requires not only canonical phosphorylation at Thr389 by mTORC1 but also phosphorylation at Ser424 and Ser429 in the C terminus by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). S6K1 phosphorylation at these additional sites induces a conformational switch and is essential for high-affinity binding and phosphorylation of EPRS, but not canonical S6K1 targets, e.g., ribosomal protein S6. Unbiased proteomic analysis identified additional targets phosphorylated by multisite phosphorylated S6K1 in insulin-stimulated adipocytes—namely, coenzyme A synthase, lipocalin 2, and cortactin. Thus, embedded within S6K1 is a target-selective kinase phospho-code that integrates signals from mTORC1 and Cdk5 to direct an insulin-stimulated, post-translational metabolon determining adipocyte lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Viral-genetic tracing techniques have enabled mesoscale mapping of neuronal connectivity by teasing apart inputs to defined neuronal populations in regions with heterogeneous cell types. We previously observed input biases to output-defined ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTA-DA) neurons. Here, we further dissect connectivity in the VTA by defining input-output relations of neurochemically and output-defined neuronal populations. By expanding our analysis to include input patterns to subtypes of excitatory (vGluT2-expressing) or inhibitory (GAD2-expressing) populations, we find that the output site, rather than neurochemical phenotype, correlates with whole-brain inputs of each subpopulation. Lastly, we find that biases in input maps to different VTA neurons can be generated using publicly available whole-brain output mapping datasets. Our comprehensive dataset and detailed spatial analysis suggest that connection specificity in the VTA is largely a function of the spatial location of the cells within the VTA.

Abstract: Summary
Specialized adult somatic cells, such as cardiomyocytes (CMs), are highly differentiated with poor renewal capacity, an integral reason underlying organ failure in disease and aging. Among the least renewable cells in the human body, CMs renew approximately 1% annually. Consistent with poor CM turnover, heart failure is the leading cause of death. Here, we show that an active version of the Hippo pathway effector YAP, termed YAP5SA, partially reprograms adult mouse CMs to a more fetal and proliferative state. One week after induction, 19% of CMs that enter S-phase do so twice, CM number increases by 40%, and YAP5SA lineage CMs couple to pre-existing CMs. Genomic studies showed that YAP5SA increases chromatin accessibility and expression of fetal genes, partially reprogramming long-lived somatic cells in vivo to a primitive, fetal-like, and proliferative state.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteriophage λN protein, a model anti-termination factor, binds nascent RNA and host Nus factors, rendering RNA polymerase resistant to all pause and termination signals. A 3.7-Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure and structure-informed functional analyses reveal a multi-pronged strategy by which the intrinsically unstructured λN directly modifies RNA polymerase interactions with the nucleic acids and subverts essential functions of NusA, NusE, and NusG to reprogram the transcriptional apparatus. λN repositions NusA and remodels the β subunit flap tip, which likely precludes folding of pause or termination RNA hairpins in the exit tunnel and disrupts termination-supporting interactions of the α subunit C-terminal domains. λN invades and traverses the RNA polymerase hybrid cavity, likely stabilizing the hybrid and impeding pause- or termination-related conformational changes of polymerase. λN also lines upstream DNA, seemingly reinforcing anti-backtracking and anti-swiveling by NusG. Moreover, λN-repositioned NusA and NusE sequester the NusG C-terminal domain, counteracting ρ-dependent termination. Other anti-terminators likely utilize similar mechanisms to enable processive transcription.

High-Molecular-Weight Hyaluronan Is a Hippo Pathway Ligand Directing Cell Density-Dependent Growth Inhibition via PAR1b,

Abstract: Summary
High-molecular-weight hyaluronan, a major component of the extracellular matrix, is anti-oncogenic, whereas low-molecular-weight hyaluronan is pro-oncogenic, though the mechanisms underlying the size-dependent opposite bioactivities of hyaluronan remain uncertain. We show here that treatment with high-molecular-weight hyaluronan stimulates tumor-suppressive Hippo signaling in breast epithelial cells. Mechanistically, clustering of the CD44 extracellular domain by high-molecular-weight hyaluronan leads to recruitment of the polarity-regulating kinase PAR1b by the CD44 intracellular domain, which results in disruption of the Hippo signaling-inhibitory PAR1b-MST complex. Once liberated from PAR1b, MST activates Hippo signaling. Conversely, low-molecular-weight hyaluronan, which is produced by hyaluronidase-mediated degradation of high-molecular-weight hyaluronan, inhibits Hippo signaling by competing with high-molecular-weight hyaluronan for CD44 binding. Triple-negative breast cancers with higher hyaluronidase-2 expression show poorer prognosis than those with lower hyaluronidase-2 expression. Consistently, decreased hyaluronidase-2 is associated with reduced tumorigenicity in a tumor xenograft model. Hence, perturbation of high-molecular-weight hyaluronan-mediated Hippo signaling activation contributes to cancer aggressiveness.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in tumor cells promotes cancer progression by suppressing cancer immunity. The retinoblastoma protein RB is a tumor suppressor known to regulate the cell cycle, DNA damage response, and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that RB interacts with nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) protein p65 and that their interaction is primarily dependent on CDK4/6-mediated serine-249/threonine-252 (S249/T252) phosphorylation of RB. RNA-seq analysis shows a subset of NF-κB pathway genes including PD-L1 are selectively upregulated by RB knockdown or CDK4/6 inhibitor. S249/T252-phosphorylated RB inversely correlates with PD-L1 expression in patient samples. Expression of a RB-derived S249/T252 phosphorylation-mimetic peptide suppresses radiotherapy-induced upregulation of PD-L1 and augments therapeutic efficacy of radiation in vivo. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function of hyperphosphorylated RB in suppressing NF-κB activity and PD-L1 expression and suggest that the RB-NF-κB axis can be exploited to overcome cancer immune evasion triggered by conventional or targeted therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Viral vectors enable foreign proteins to be expressed in brains of non-genetic species, including non-human primates. However, viruses targeting specific neuron classes have proved elusive. Here we describe viral promoters and strategies for accessing GABAergic interneurons and their molecularly defined subsets in the rodent and primate. Using a set intersection approach, which relies on two co-active promoters, we can restrict heterologous protein expression to cortical and hippocampal somatostatin-positive and parvalbumin-positive interneurons. With an orthogonal set difference method, we can enrich for subclasses of neuropeptide-Y-positive GABAergic interneurons by effectively subtracting the expression pattern of one promoter from that of another. These methods harness the complexity of gene expression patterns in the brain and significantly expand the number of genetically tractable neuron classes across mammals.

Abstract: The application of mechanical stimuli to cells often induce increases in intracellular calcium, affecting the regulation of a variety of cell functions. Although the mechanism of mechanotransduction-induced calcium increases has not been fully resolved, the involvement of mechanosensitive ion channels in the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum has been reported. Here, we demonstrate that voltage-gated L-type calcium channels play a critical role in the mechanosensitive calcium response in H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes. The intracellular calcium level in H9c2 cells increased in a reproducible dose-dependent manner in response to uniaxial stretching. The stretch-activated calcium response (SICR) completely disappeared in calcium-free medium, whereas thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid, inhibitors of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, partially reduced the SICR. These findings suggest that both calcium influx across the cell membrane and calcium release from the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum are involved in the SICR. Nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil, inhibitors of L-type calcium channels, reduced the SICR in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, small interfering RNA against the L-type calcium channel α1c subunit diminished the SICR dramatically. Nifedipine also diminished the mechanosensitivity of Langendorff-perfused rat heart. These results suggest that the SICR in H9c2 cardiomyocytes involves the activation of L-type calcium channels and subsequent calcium release from the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum.

Abstract: Summary
PARP-1 synthesizes long poly(ADP-ribose) chains (PAR) at DNA damage sites to recruit DNA repair factors. Among proteins relocated on damaged DNA, the RNA-binding protein FUS is one of the most abundant, raising the issue about its involvement in DNA repair. Here, we reconstituted the PARP-1/PAR/DNA system in vitro and analyzed at the single-molecule level the role of FUS. We demonstrate successively the dissociation of FUS from mRNA, its recruitment at DNA damage sites through its binding to PAR, and the assembly of damaged DNA-rich compartments. PARG, an enzyme family that hydrolyzes PAR, is sufficient to dissociate damaged DNA-rich compartments in vitro and initiates the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of FUS in cells. We anticipate that, consistent with previous models, FUS facilitates DNA repair through the transient compartmentalization of DNA damage sites. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of FUS after the PARG-mediated compartment dissociation may participate in the formation of cytoplasmic FUS aggregates.

Abstract: The liver is involved in a wide range of activities in vertebrates and some other animals, including metabolism, protein synthesis, detoxification, and the immune system. Until now, various methods have been devised to study liver diseases; however, each method has its own limitations. In situ liver perfusion machinery, originally developed in rats, has been successfully adapted to mice, enabling the study of liver diseases. Here we describe the protocol, which is a simple but widely applicable method for investigating the liver diseases. The liver is perfused in situ by cannulation of the portal vein and suprahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC), with antegrade closed circuit circulation completed by clamping the infrahepatic IVC. In situ liver perfusion can be utilized to evaluate immune cell migration and function, hemodynamics and related cellular reactions in each type of hepatic cells, and the metabolism of toxic or other compounds by changing the composition of the circulating media. In situ liver perfusion method maintains liver function and cell viability for up to 2 h. This study also describes an optional protocol using density-gradient centrifugation for the separation of different types of hepatic cells, allowing the determination of changes in each cell type. In summary, this method of in situ liver perfusion will be useful for studying liver diseases as a complement to other established methods.

Abstract: Summary
A truncating mutation in the mouse Srrm4 gene, which encodes a neuronal splicing factor, causes alternative splicing defects selectively in the ear. The mechanism by which splicing is preserved in the brain of these mice is not known. Here, we show that SRRM3 limits the Srrm4 mutation-associated defects to the ear and that, in cortical neurons, overlapping SRRM3-SRRM4 activity regulates the development of interneuronal inhibition. In vitro, SRRM3 and SRRM4 regulate the same splicing events, but a mutation in mouse Srrm3 causes tremors and mild defects in neuronal alternative splicing, demonstrating unique SRRM3 roles in vivo. Mice harboring mutations in both Srrm3 and Srrm4 die neonatally and exhibit severe splicing defects. In these mice, splicing alterations prevent inactivation of the gene repressor REST, which maintains immature excitatory GABAergic neurotransmission by repressing K-Cl cotransporter 2. Thus, our data reveal that SRRM3 and SRRM4 act redundantly to regulate GABAergic neurotransmission by inactivating REST.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells heavily depend on the amino acid glutamine to meet the demands associated with growth and proliferation. Due to the rapid consumption of glutamine, cancer cells frequently undergo glutamine starvation in vivo. We and others have shown that p53 is a critical regulator in metabolic stress resistance. To better understand the molecular mechanisms by which p53 activation promotes cancer cell adaptation to glutamine deprivation, we identified p53-dependent genes that are induced upon glutamine deprivation by using RNA-seq analysis. We show that Slc7a3, an arginine transporter, is significantly induced by p53. We also show that increased intracellular arginine levels following glutamine deprivation are dependent on p53. The influx of arginine has minimal effects on known metabolic pathways upon glutamine deprivation. Instead, we found arginine serves as an effector for mTORC1 activation to promote cell growth in response to glutamine starvation. Therefore, we identify a p53-inducible gene that contributes to the metabolic stress response.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic beta cells have been shown to be heterogeneous at multiple levels. However, spatially interrogating transcriptional heterogeneity in the intact tissue has been challenging. Here, we developed an optimized protocol for single-molecule transcript imaging in the intact pancreas and used it to identify a sub-population of “extreme” beta cells with elevated mRNA levels of insulin and other secretory genes. Extreme beta cells contain higher ribosomal and proinsulin content but lower levels of insulin protein in fasted states, suggesting they may be tuned for basal insulin secretion. They exhibit a distinctive intra-cellular polarization pattern, with elevated mRNA concentrations in an apical ER-enriched compartment, distinct from the localization of nascent and mature proteins. The proportion of extreme cells increases in db/db diabetic mice, potentially facilitating the required increase in basal insulin. Our results thus highlight a sub-population of beta cells that may carry distinct functional roles along physiological and pathological timescales.

Abstract: Summary
The hepatic TCA cycle supports oxidative and biosynthetic metabolism. This dual responsibility requires anaplerotic pathways, such as pyruvate carboxylase (PC), to generate TCA cycle intermediates necessary for biosynthesis without disrupting oxidative metabolism. Liver-specific PC knockout (LPCKO) mice were created to test the role of anaplerotic flux in liver metabolism. LPCKO mice have impaired hepatic anaplerosis, diminution of TCA cycle intermediates, suppressed gluconeogenesis, reduced TCA cycle flux, and a compensatory increase in ketogenesis and renal gluconeogenesis. Loss of PC depleted aspartate and compromised urea cycle function, causing elevated urea cycle intermediates and hyperammonemia. Loss of PC prevented diet-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance but depleted NADPH and glutathione, which exacerbated oxidative stress and correlated with elevated liver inflammation. Thus, despite catalyzing the synthesis of intermediates also produced by other anaplerotic pathways, PC is specifically necessary for maintaining oxidation, biosynthesis, and pathways distal to the TCA cycle, such as antioxidant defenses.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1, also called B7-H1) is an immune checkpoint protein that inhibits immune function through its binding of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor. Clinically approved antibodies block extracellular PD-1 and PD-L1 binding, yet the role of intracellular PD-L1 in cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we discovered that intracellular PD-L1 acts as an RNA binding protein that regulates the mRNA stability of NBS1, BRCA1, and other DNA damage-related genes. Through competition with the RNA exosome, intracellular PD-L1 protects targeted RNAs from degradation, thereby increasing cellular resistance to DNA damage. RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA-seq experiments demonstrated that PD-L1 regulates RNA stability genome-wide. Furthermore, we developed a PD-L1 antibody, H1A, which abrogates the interaction of PD-L1 with CMTM6, thereby promoting PD-L1 degradation. Intracellular PD-L1 may be a potential therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in cancer through the inhibition of DNA damage response and repair.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosome organization has a key role in transcriptional regulation, yet the precise mechanisms establishing nucleosome locations and their effect on transcription are unclear. Here, we use an induced degradation system to screen all yeast ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers. We characterize how rapid clearance of the remodeler affects nucleosome locations. Specifically, depletion of Sth1, the catalytic subunit of the RSC (remodel the structure of chromatin) complex, leads to rapid fill-in of nucleosome-free regions at gene promoters. These changes are reversible upon reintroduction of Sth1 and do not depend on DNA replication. RSC-dependent nucleosome positioning is pivotal in maintaining promoters of lowly expressed genes free from nucleosomes. In contrast, we observe that upon acute stress, the RSC is not necessary for the transcriptional response. Moreover, RSC-dependent nucleosome positions are tightly related to usage of specific transcription start sites. Our results suggest organizational principles that determine nucleosome positions with and without RSC and how these interact with the transcriptional process.

Abstract: Summary
Animals must adjust their metabolism as they progress through development in order to meet the needs of each stage in the life cycle. Here, we show that the dHNF4 nuclear receptor acts at the onset of Drosophila adulthood to direct an essential switch in lipid metabolism. Lipid stores are consumed shortly after metamorphosis but contribute little to energy metabolism. Rather, dHNF4 directs their conversion to very long chain fatty acids and hydrocarbons, which waterproof the animal to preserve fluid homeostasis. Similarly, HNF4α is required in mouse hepatocytes for the expression of fatty acid elongases that contribute to a waterproof epidermis, suggesting that this pathway is conserved through evolution. This developmental switch in Drosophila lipid metabolism promotes lifespan and desiccation resistance in adults and suppresses hallmarks of diabetes, including elevated glucose levels and intolerance to dietary sugars. These studies establish dHNF4 as a regulator of the adult metabolic state.

Abstract: Summary
Fc receptor for IgM (FcμR)-deficient mice display dysregulated function of neutrophils, dendritic cells, and B cells. The relevance of FcμR to human T cells is still unknown. We show that FcμR is mostly stored inside the cell and that surface expression is tightly regulated. Decreased surface expression on T cells from elderly individuals is associated with alterations in the methylation pattern of the FCMR gene. Binding and internalization of IgM stimulate transport of FcμR to the cell surface to ensure sustained IgM uptake. Concurrently, IgM accumulates within the cell, and the surface expression of other receptors increases, among them the T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory molecules. This leads to enhanced TCR signaling, proliferation, and cytokine release, in response to low, but not high, doses of antigen. Our findings indicate that FcμR is an important regulator of T cell function and reveal an additional mode of interaction between B and T cells.

Abstract: Summary
The conversion of lipolysis-derived fatty acids into ketone bodies (ketogenesis) is a crucial metabolic adaptation to prolonged periods of food scarcity. The process occurs primarily in liver mitochondria and is initiated by fatty-acid-mediated stimulation of the ligand-operated transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α). Here, we present evidence that mast cells contribute to the control of fasting-induced ketogenesis via a paracrine mechanism that involves secretion of histamine into the hepatic portal circulation, stimulation of liver H1 receptors, and local biosynthesis of the high-affinity PPAR-α agonist, oleoylethanolamide (OEA). Genetic or pharmacological interventions that disable any one of these events, including mast cell elimination, deletion of histamine- or OEA-synthesizing enzymes, and H1 blockade, blunt ketogenesis without affecting lipolysis. The results reveal an unexpected role for mast cells in the regulation of systemic fatty-acid homeostasis, and suggest that OEA may act in concert with lipolysis-derived fatty acids to activate liver PPAR-α and promote ketogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
SUFU alterations are common in human Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subgroup medulloblastoma (MB). However, its tumorigenic mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, we report that loss of Sufu alone is unable to induce MB formation in mice, due to insufficient Gli2 activation. Simultaneous loss of Spop, an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting Gli2, restores robust Gli2 activation and induces rapid MB formation in Sufu knockout background. We also demonstrated a tumor-promoting role of Sufu in Smo-activated MB (∼60% of human SHH MB) by maintaining robust Gli activity. Having established Gli2 activation as a key driver of SHH MB, we report a comprehensive analysis of its targetome. Furthermore, we identified Atoh1 as a target and molecular accomplice of Gli2 that activates core SHH MB signature genes in a synergistic manner. Overall, our work establishes the dual role of SUFU in SHH MB and provides mechanistic insights into transcriptional regulation underlying Gli2-mediated SHH MB tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which is a highly heterogeneous process. Here we report the cell fate continuum during somatic cell reprogramming at single-cell resolution. We first develop SOT to analyze cell fate continuum from Oct4/Sox2/Klf4- or OSK-mediated reprogramming and show that cells bifurcate into two categories, reprogramming potential (RP) or non-reprogramming (NR). We further show that Klf4 contributes to Cd34+/Fxyd5+/Psca+ keratinocyte-like NR fate and that IFN-γ impedes the final transition to chimera-competent pluripotency along the RP cells. We analyze more than 150,000 single cells from both OSK and chemical reprograming and identify additional NR/RP bifurcation points. Our work reveals a generic bifurcation model for cell fate decisions during somatic cell reprogramming that may be applicable to other systems and inspire further improvements for reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
An insufficient adaptive beta-cell compensation is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Primary cilia function as versatile sensory antennae regulating various cellular processes, but their role on compensatory beta-cell replication has not been examined. Here, we identify a significant enrichment of downregulated, cilia-annotated genes in pancreatic islets of diabetes-prone NZO mice as compared with diabetes-resistant B6-ob/ob mice. Among 327 differentially expressed mouse cilia genes, 81 human orthologs are also affected in islets of diabetic donors. Islets of nondiabetic mice and humans show a substantial overlap of upregulated cilia genes that are linked to cell-cycle progression. The shRNA-mediated suppression of KIF3A, essential for ciliogenesis, impairs division of MIN6 beta cells as well as in dispersed primary mouse and human islet cells, as shown by decreased BrdU incorporation. These findings demonstrate the substantial role of cilia-gene regulation on islet function and T2D risk.

Abstract: Summary
Contrasting with fish or amphibian, retinal regeneration from Müller glia is largely limited in mammals. In our quest toward the identification of molecular cues that may boost their stemness potential, we investigated the involvement of the Hippo pathway effector YAP (Yes-associated protein), which is upregulated in Müller cells following retinal injury. Conditional Yap deletion in mouse Müller cells prevents cell-cycle gene upregulation that normally accompanies reactive gliosis upon photoreceptor cell death. We further show that, in Xenopus, a species endowed with efficient regenerative capacity, YAP is required for their injury-dependent proliferative response. In the mouse retina, where Müller cells do not spontaneously proliferate, YAP overactivation is sufficient to induce their reprogramming into highly proliferative cells. Overall, we unravel a pivotal role for YAP in tuning Müller cell proliferative response to injury and highlight a YAP-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) axis by which Müller cells exit their quiescence state, a critical step toward regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Biliary tract carcinomas (BTCs) are among the most aggressive malignancies and have a poor prognosis. Here, we successfully established organoid lines derived from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater. These organoids derived from BTCs were cultured stably for >1 year and closely recapitulated the histopathology, gene expression, and genetic alterations evident in the primary tumors. Gene expression profiling of the organoids revealed that SOX2 could be a potential prognostic biomarker for patients with BTC. We screened a compound library consisting of drugs used clinically for their ability to suppress organoids derived from BTCs and found that the antifungal drugs amorolfine and fenticonazole significantly suppressed the growth of organoids derived from BTCs with minimal toxicity to normal biliary epithelial cells. Patient-derived organoids may be a powerful research tool for the clarification of molecular pathogenesis and the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic drugs for refractory cancers.

Abstract: Summary
TNF-α is a pleiotropic cytokine that has the potential to induce apoptosis under inflammation. How endothelial cells (ECs) are spared from this fate in inflammatory environments where TNF-α is present is not known. Here, we show that TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) ensures EC survival and maintains vascular integrity upon TNF-α stimulation. Endothelial-specific TAK1 knockout mice exhibit intestinal and liver hemorrhage due to EC apoptosis, leading to vascular destruction and rapid death. This EC apoptosis was induced by TNF-α from myeloid cells responding to intestinal microbiota. TNF-α secretion associated with inflammation also induced vascular defects in inflamed organs. Additionally, we determined that TAK1 deletion in tumor ECs resulted in blood vessel and hence tumor regression. Our results illuminate mechanisms ensuring survival of intestinal and liver ECs under physiological conditions and ECs of other organs under inflammatory conditions that could be exploited for anti-angiogenic therapy to treat cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The spread of mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV), which causes neurological disorders and microcephaly, highlights the need for countermeasures against sudden viral epidemics. Here, we tested the concept that drugs targeting host proteostasis provide effective antivirals. We show that different cytosolic Hsp70 isoforms are recruited to ZIKV-induced compartments and are required for virus replication at pre- and post-entry steps. Drugs targeting Hsp70 significantly reduce replication of different ZIKV strains in human and mosquito cells, including human neural stem cells and a placental trophoblast cell line, at doses without appreciable toxicity to the host cell. By targeting several ZIKV functions, including entry, establishment of active replication complexes, and capsid assembly, Hsp70 inhibitors are refractory to the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Importantly, these drugs protected mouse models from ZIKV infection, reducing viremia, mortality, and disease symptoms. Hsp70 inhibitors are thus attractive candidates for ZIKV therapeutics with the added benefit of a broad spectrum of action.

Abstract: Summary
B cell development is a highly regulated process that requires stepwise rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes to generate a functional B cell receptor (BCR). The polycomb group protein BMI1 is required for B cell development, but its function in developing B cells remains poorly defined. We demonstrate that BMI1 functions in a cell-autonomous manner at two stages during early B cell development. First, loss of BMI1 results in a differentiation block at the pro-B cell to pre-B cell transition due to the inability of BMI1-deficient cells to transcribe newly rearranged Igh genes. Accordingly, introduction of a pre-rearranged Igh allele partially restored B cell development in Bmi1−/− mice. In addition, BMI1 is required to prevent premature p53 signaling, and as a consequence, Bmi1−/− large pre-B cells fail to properly proliferate. Altogether, our results clarify the role of BMI1 in early B cell development and uncover an unexpected function of BMI1 during VDJ recombination.

Abstract: Summary
We comprehensively analyzed clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic data of a cohort of 465 primary triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). PIK3CA mutations and copy-number gains of chromosome 22q11 were more frequent in our Chinese cohort than in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We classified TNBCs into four transcriptome-based subtypes: (1) luminal androgen receptor (LAR), (2) immunomodulatory, (3) basal-like immune-suppressed, and (4) mesenchymal-like. Putative therapeutic targets or biomarkers were identified among each subtype. Importantly, the LAR subtype showed more ERBB2 somatic mutations, infrequent mutational signature 3 and frequent CDKN2A loss. The comprehensive profile of TNBCs provided here will serve as a reference to further advance the understanding and precision treatment of TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
Muscle LIM protein (MLP) has long been regarded as a muscle-specific protein. Here, we report that MLP expression is induced in adult rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) upon axotomy, and its expression is correlated with their ability to regenerate injured axons. Specific knockdown of MLP in RGCs compromises axon regeneration, while overexpression in vivo facilitates optic nerve regeneration and regrowth of sensory neurons without affecting neuronal survival. MLP accumulates in the cell body, the nucleus, and in axonal growth cones, which are significantly enlarged by its overexpression. Only the MLP fraction in growth cones is relevant for promoting axon extension. Additional data suggest that MLP acts as an actin cross-linker, thereby facilitating filopodia formation and increasing growth cone motility. Thus, MLP-mediated effects on actin could become a therapeutic strategy for promoting nerve repair.

Wnt pathway activation induced asparaginase sensitivity in distinct treatment-resistant subtypes of acute leukemia, but not in normal hematopoietic progenitors. Sensitization to asparaginase was mediated by Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins (Wnt/STOP), which inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-dependent protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, a catabolic source of asparagine. Inhibiting the alpha isoform of GSK3 phenocopied this effect, and pharmacologic GSK3α inhibition profoundly sensitized drug-resistant leukemias to asparaginase. Our findings provide a molecular rationale for activation of Wnt/STOP signaling to improve the therapeutic index of asparaginase.

Abstract: Summary
N7-methylguanosine (m7G) is a positively charged, essential modification at the 5′ cap of eukaryotic mRNA, regulating mRNA export, translation, and splicing. m7G also occurs internally within tRNA and rRNA, but its existence and distribution within eukaryotic mRNA remain to be investigated. Here, we show the presence of internal m7G sites within mammalian mRNA. We then performed transcriptome-wide profiling of internal m7G methylome using m7G-MeRIP sequencing (MeRIP-seq). To map this modification at base resolution, we developed a chemical-assisted sequencing approach that selectively converts internal m7G sites into abasic sites, inducing misincorporation at these sites during reverse transcription. This base-resolution m7G-seq enabled transcriptome-wide mapping of m7G in human tRNA and mRNA, revealing distribution features of the internal m7G methylome in human cells. We also identified METTL1 as a methyltransferase that installs a subset of m7G within mRNA and showed that internal m7G methylation could affect mRNA translation.

Abstract: Summary
Large cohorts of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from healthy donors are a potentially powerful tool for investigating the relationship between genetic variants and cellular behavior. Here, we integrate high content imaging of cell shape, proliferation, and other phenotypes with gene expression and DNA sequence datasets from over 100 human iPSC lines. By applying a dimensionality reduction approach, Probabilistic Estimation of Expression Residuals (PEER), we extracted factors that captured the effects of intrinsic (genetic concordance between different cell lines from the same donor) and extrinsic (cell responses to different fibronectin concentrations) conditions. We identify genes that correlate in expression with intrinsic and extrinsic PEER factors and associate outlier cell behavior with genes containing rare deleterious non-synonymous SNVs. Our study, thus, establishes a strategy for examining the genetic basis of inter-individual variability in cell behavior.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) maintains the integrity of the proteome by selectively degrading misfolded or mis-assembled proteins, but the rules that govern how conformationally defective proteins in the secretory pathway are selected from the structurally and topologically diverse constellation of correctly folded membrane and secretory proteins for efficient degradation by cytosolic proteasomes is not well understood. Here, we combine parallel pooled genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 forward genetic screening with a highly quantitative and sensitive protein turnover assay to discover a previously undescribed collaboration between membrane-embedded cytoplasmic ubiquitin E3 ligases to conjugate heterotypic branched or mixed ubiquitin (Ub) chains on substrates of endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). These findings demonstrate that parallel CRISPR analysis can be used to deconvolve highly complex cell biological processes and identify new biochemical pathways in protein quality control.

Abstract: Summary
The immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus features a dynamic chromatin landscape to promote class switch recombination (CSR), yet the mechanisms that regulate this landscape remain poorly understood. CHD4, a component of the chromatin remodeling NuRD complex, directly binds H3K9me3, an epigenetic mark present at the Igh locus during CSR. We find that CHD4 is essential for early B cell development but is dispensable for the homeostatic maintenance of mature, naive B cells. However, loss of CHD4 in mature B cells impairs CSR because of suboptimal targeting of AID to the Igh locus. Additionally, we find that CHD4 represses p53 expression to promote B cell proliferation. This work reveals distinct roles for CHD4 in B cell development and CSR and links the H3K9me3 epigenetic mark with AID recruitment to the Igh locus.

Abstract: Summary
The chromatin-associated protein WDR5 is a promising target for pharmacological inhibition in cancer. Drug discovery efforts center on the blockade of the “WIN site” of WDR5, a well-defined pocket that is amenable to small molecule inhibition. Various cancer contexts have been proposed to be targets for WIN site inhibitors, but a lack of understanding of WDR5 target genes and of the primary effects of WIN site inhibitors hampers their utility. Here, by the discovery of potent WIN site inhibitors, we demonstrate that the WIN site links WDR5 to chromatin at a small cohort of loci, including a specific subset of ribosome protein genes. WIN site inhibitors rapidly displace WDR5 from chromatin and decrease the expression of associated genes, causing translational inhibition, nucleolar stress, and p53 induction. Our studies define a mode by which WDR5 engages chromatin and forecast that WIN site blockade could have utility against multiple cancer types.

Abstract: Summary
Sarcomatoid urothelial bladder cancer (SARC) displays a high propensity for distant metastasis and is associated with short survival. We report a comprehensive genomic analysis of 28 cases of SARC and 84 cases of conventional urothelial carcinoma (UC), with the TCGA cohort of 408 muscle-invasive bladder cancers serving as the reference. SARCs show a distinct mutational landscape, with enrichment of TP53, RB1, and PIK3CA mutations. They are related to the basal molecular subtype of conventional UCs and could be divided into epithelial-basal and more clinically aggressive mesenchymal subsets on the basis of TP63 and its target gene expression levels. Other analyses reveal that SARCs are driven by downregulation of homotypic adherence genes and dysregulation of the EMT network, and nearly half exhibit a heavily infiltrated immune phenotype. Our observations have important implications for prognostication and the development of more effective therapies for this highly lethal variant of bladder cancer.

Abstract: Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, which significantly reduces the life expectancy. Early detection of melanoma can reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with skin cancer. Dermoscopic images acquired by dermoscopic instruments are used in computational analysis for skin cancer detection. However, some image quality limitations such as noises, shadows, artefacts exist that could compromise the robustness of the skin image analysis. Hence, developing an automatic intelligent system for skin cancer diagnosis with accurate detection rate is crucial. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in dermoscopic images of skin lesions. Our experiment is conducted on a graphics processing unit (GPU) to speed up the training and deployment process. To enhance the quality of images, we employ different pre-processing steps. We also apply data augmentation methodology such as horizontal and vertical flipping techniques to address the class skewness problem. Both pre-processing and data augmentation could help to improve the final accuracy.

Abstract: Summary
The greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, degrades wax and plastic molecules. Despite much interest, the genetic basis of these hallmark traits remains poorly understood. Herein, we assembled high-quality genome and transcriptome data from G. mellonella to investigate long-chain hydrocarbon wax metabolism strategies. Specific carboxylesterase and lipase and fatty-acid-metabolism-related enzymes in the G. mellonella genome are transcriptionally regulated during feeding on beeswax. Strikingly, G. mellonella lacking intestinal microbiota successfully decomposes long-chain fatty acids following wax metabolism, although the intestinal microbiome performs a supplementary role in short-chain fatty acid degradation. Notably, final wax derivatives were detected by gas chromatography even in the absence of gut microbiota. Our findings provide insight into wax moth adaptation and may assist in the development of unique wax-degradation strategies with a similar metabolic approach for a plastic molecule polyethylene biodegradation using organisms without intestinal microbiota.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical plasticity peaks early in life and tapers in adulthood, as exemplified in the primary visual cortex (V1), wherein brief loss of vision in one eye reduces cortical responses to inputs from that eye during the critical period but not in adulthood. The synaptic locus of cortical plasticity and the cell-autonomous synaptic factors determining critical periods remain unclear. We here demonstrate that the immunoglobulin protein Synaptic Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (SynCAM 1/Cadm1) is regulated by visual experience and limits V1 plasticity. Loss of SynCAM 1 selectively reduces the number of thalamocortical inputs onto parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons, impairing the maturation of feedforward inhibition in V1. SynCAM 1 acts in PV+ interneurons to actively restrict cortical plasticity, and brief PV+-specific knockdown of SynCAM 1 in adult visual cortex restores juvenile-like plasticity. These results identify a synapse-specific, cell-autonomous mechanism for thalamocortical visual circuit maturation and closure of the visual critical period.

Abstract: Summary
Proximity-dependent biotin labeling (BioID) may identify new targets for cancers driven by difficult-to-drug oncogenes such as Ras. Therefore, BioID was used with wild-type (WT) and oncogenic mutant (MT) H-, K-, and N-Ras, identifying known interactors, including Raf and PI3K, as well as a common set of 130 novel proteins proximal to all Ras isoforms. A CRISPR screen of these proteins for Ras dependence identified mTOR, which was also found proximal to MT Ras in human tumors. Oncogenic Ras directly bound two mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) components, mTOR and MAPKAP1, to promote mTORC2 kinase activity at the plasma membrane. mTORC2 enabled the Ras pro-proliferative cell cycle transcriptional program, and perturbing the Ras-mTORC2 interaction impaired Ras-dependent neoplasia in vivo. Combining proximity-dependent proteomics with CRISPR screening identified a new set of functional Ras-associated proteins, defined mTORC2 as a new direct Ras effector, and offers a strategy for finding new proteins that cooperate with dominant oncogenes.

Abstract: Summary
Fatty acid uptake is the first step in fatty acid utilization, but it remains unclear how the process is regulated. Protein palmitoylation is a fatty acyl modification that plays a key regulatory role in protein targeting and trafficking; however, its function in regulating fatty acid metabolism is unknown. Here, we show that two of the Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif-containing palmitoyl acyltransferases, DHHC4 and DHHC5, regulate fatty acid uptake. DHHC4 and DHHC5 function at different subcellular localizations to control the palmitoylation, plasma membrane localization, and fatty acid uptake activity of the scavenger receptor CD36. Depletion of either DHHC4 or DHHC5 in cells disrupts CD36-dependent fatty acid uptake. Furthermore, both Dhhc4−/− and adipose-specific Dhhc5 knockout mice show decreased fatty acid uptake activity in adipose tissues and develop severe hypothermia upon acute cold exposure. These findings demonstrate a critical role of DHHC4 and DHHC5 in regulating fatty acid uptake.

Abstract: Summary
Quantitative imaging of oxygen distributions in tissue can provide invaluable information about metabolism in normal and diseased states. Two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM) has been developed to perform measurements of oxygen in vivo with micron-scale resolution in 3D; however, the method’s potential has not yet been fully realized due to the limitations of current phosphorescent probe technology. Here, we report a new sensor, Oxyphor 2P, that enables oxygen microscopy twice as deep (up to 600 μm below the tissue surface) and with ∼60 times higher speed than previously possible. Oxyphor 2P allows longitudinal oxygen measurements without having to inject the probe directly into the imaged region. As proof of principle, we monitored oxygen dynamics for days following micro-stroke induced by occlusion of a single capillary in the mouse brain. Oxyphor 2P opens up new possibilities for studies of tissue metabolic states using 2PLM in a wide range of biomedical research areas.

Abstract: Summary
Macroautophagy/autophagy is a key catabolic recycling pathway that requires fine-tuned regulation to prevent pathologies and preserve homeostasis. Here, we report a new post-transcriptional pathway regulating autophagy involving the Pat1-Lsm (Lsm1 to Lsm7) mRNA-binding complex. Under nitrogen-starvation conditions, Pat1-Lsm binds a specific subset of autophagy-related (ATG) transcripts and prevents their 3′ to 5′ degradation by the exosome complex, leading to ATG mRNA stabilization and accumulation. This process is regulated through Pat1 dephosphorylation, is necessary for the efficient expression of specific Atg proteins, and is required for robust autophagy induction during nitrogen starvation. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first example of ATG transcript regulation via 3′ binding factors and exosomal degradation.

Abstract: Summary
The recent work of Besseling and Bringmann (2016) identified a molecular intervention for C. elegans in which premature segregation of maternal and paternal chromosomes in the fertilized oocyte can produce viable animals exhibiting a non-Mendelian inheritance pattern. Overexpression in embryos of a single protein regulating chromosome segregation (GPR-1) provides a germline derived clonally from a single parental gamete. We present a collection of strains and cytological assays to consistently generate and track non-Mendelian inheritance. These tools allow reproducible and high-frequency (>80%) production of non-Mendelian inheritance, the facile and simultaneous homozygosis for all nuclear chromosomes in a single generation, the precise exchange of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes between strains, and the assessments of non-canonical mitosis events. We show the utility of these strains by demonstrating a rapid assessment of cell lineage requirements (AB versus P1) for a set of genes (lin-2, lin-3, lin-12, and lin-31) with roles in C. elegans vulval development.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), despite having damaging roles, serve as signaling molecules regulating diverse biological and physiological processes. Employing in vivo genetic studies in Drosophila, we show that besides causing G1-S arrest by activation of Dacapo, ROS can simultaneously inhibit cell growth by regulating the expression of 4EBP and S6K. This is achieved by triggering a signaling cascade that includes Ask1, JNK, and FOXO independent of the Tsc-TOR growth regulatory pathway. Qualitative and quantitative differences in the types of ROS molecules generated dictate whether cells undergo G1-S arrest only or experience blocks in both cell proliferation and growth. Importantly, during normal development, this signaling cascade is triggered by ecdysone in late larval fat body cells to restrict their growth prior to pupation by antagonizing insulin signaling. The present work reveals an unexpected role of ROS in systemic control of growth in response to steroid hormone signaling to establish organismal size.

Abstract: Limited self-restorative ability of the cartilage has necessitated the use of cell and tissue engineering based therapies. Recent advances in the isolation, expansion and characterization of articular cartilage derived chondroprogenitors(CPs) has gained popularity in its role for cartilage repair. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a reliable biological scaffold for in-vitro and in-vivo studies with reported therapeutic applications in cartilage and bone pathologies. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether human allogeneic PRP could serve as a biological scaffold for chondroprogenitors (CPs) in cartilage repair. CPs were isolated from the superficial layer of three osteoarthritic knee joints by fibronectin adhesion assay and characterized using flow cytometric analysis. Allogeneic citrated blood was harvested from three subjects to obtain PRP. CPs at a concentration of one million cells per ml were gelled with PRP using calcium chloride. The PRP-CP scaffolds were subjected for adipogeneic, osteogenic, chondrogeneic differentiation and processed for post differentiation-staining studies (Oil Red O, Von Kossa, Alcian blue staining), immunofluorescence (collagen II) and live dead assays (Calcein AM-Ethidium Homodimer). We show that PRP was able to sustain CP cell viability and differentiate towards adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineage under appropriate culture conditions. We also noted positive extracellular matrix production in PRP-CP scaffolds cultured without chondrogenic supplementation. Our results suggest that PRP could be a promising bio-active scaffold due to its synergistic effect in supporting cell proliferation, maintaining cell viability and favoring extracellular matrix production. PRP can be used as biological scaffold for the delivery of CPs in cartilage healing.

Abstract: Summary
The role of stress-induced increases in SUMO2/3 conjugation during the heat shock response (HSR) has remained enigmatic. We investigated SUMO signal transduction at the proteomic and functional level during the HSR in cells depleted of proteostasis network components via chronic heat shock factor 1 inhibition. In the recovery phase post heat shock, high SUMO2/3 conjugation was prolonged in cells lacking sufficient chaperones. Similar results were obtained upon inhibiting HSP90, indicating that increased chaperone activity during the HSR is critical for recovery to normal SUMO2/3 levels post-heat shock. Proteasome inhibition likewise prolonged SUMO2/3 conjugation, indicating that stress-induced SUMO2/3 targets are subsequently degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Functionally, we suggest that SUMOylation can enhance the solubility of target proteins upon heat shock, a phenomenon that we experimentally observed in vitro. Collectively, our results implicate SUMO2/3 as a rapid response factor that coordinates proteome degradation and assists the maintenance of proteostasis upon proteotoxic stress.

Abstract: Summary
Excessive levels of saturated fatty acids are toxic to cells, although the basis for this lipotoxicity remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome, lipidome, and genetic interactions of human leukemia cells exposed to palmitate. Palmitate treatment increased saturated glycerolipids, accompanied by a transcriptional stress response, including upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. A comprehensive genome-wide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen identified >350 genes modulating lipotoxicity. Among previously unknown genetic modifiers of lipotoxicity, depletion of RNF213, a putative ubiquitin ligase mutated in Moyamoya vascular disease, protected cells from lipotoxicity. On a broader level, integration of our comprehensive datasets revealed that changes in di-saturated glycerolipids, but not other lipid classes, are central to lipotoxicity in this model. Consistent with this, inhibition of ER-localized glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity protected from all aspects of lipotoxicity. Identification of genes modulating the response to saturated fatty acids may reveal novel therapeutic strategies for treating metabolic diseases linked to lipotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Cholesterol is highly enriched at the plasma membrane (PM), and lipid transfer proteins may deliver cholesterol to the PM in a nonvesicular manner. Here, through a mini-screen, we identified the oxysterol binding protein (OSBP)-related protein 2 (ORP2) as a novel mediator of selective cholesterol delivery to the PM. Interestingly, ORP2-mediated enrichment of PM cholesterol was coupled with the removal of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) from the PM. ORP2 overexpression or deficiency impacted the levels of PM cholesterol and PI(4,5)P2, and ORP2 efficiently transferred both cholesterol and PI(4,5)P2 in vitro. We determined the structure of ORP2 in complex with PI(4,5)P2 at 2.7 Å resolution. ORP2 formed a stable tetramer in the presence of PI(4,5)P2, and tetramerization was required for ORP2 to transfer PI(4,5)P2. Our results identify a novel pathway for cholesterol delivery to the PM and establish ORP2 as a key regulator of both cholesterol and PI(4,5)P2 of the PM.

Abstract: Summary
The BCR-ABL1 fusion protein is the cause of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and of a significant fraction of adult-onset B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases. Using mouse models and patient-derived samples, we identified an essential role for γ-catenin in the initiation and maintenance of BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL but not CML. The selectivity was explained by a partial γ-catenin dependence of MYC expression together with the susceptibility of B-ALL, but not CML, to reduced MYC levels. MYC and γ-catenin enabled B-ALL maintenance by augmenting BIRC5 and enforced BIRC5 expression overcame γ-catenin loss. Since γ-catenin was dispensable for normal hematopoiesis, these lineage- and disease-specific features of canonical Wnt signaling identified a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL.

Abstract: Most fungi have multiple chitin synthases (CSs) that may make chitin at different sites on the cell surface, at different times during growth, and in response to cell wall stress. The structure-based model for CS function is for transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane to the non-reducing end of a growing chitin chain, which is concomitantly translocated through a transmembrane channel formed by the synthase. Two aspects of CS mechanism are investigated: how chains might be initiated, and what governs how long they can get. First, it is shown that CSs incorporate free GlcNAc into di-N-acetylchitobiose and into insoluble chitin in a UDP-GlcNAc-dependent manner, and therefore that GlcNAc primes chitin synthesis. Second, average lengths of insoluble chitin chains were measured by determining the molar ratio of priming GlcNAc to chain-extending, UDP-GlcNAc-derived GlcNAc, and showed dependence on UDP-GlcNAc concentration, approaching a maximum at higher concentrations of substrate. These results, together with previous findings that 2-acylamido GlcN analogues prime formation of chitin oligosaccharides and stimulate chitin synthesis are discussed in the context of the structure-based model, and lead to the following proposals. 1) CSs may “self-prime” by hydrolyzing UDP-GlcNAc to yield GlcNAc. 2) A CS’s active site is not continuously occupied by a nascent chitin chain, rather, CSs can release chitin chains, then re-initiate, and therefore synthesize chitin chains in bursts. 3) The length of chitin chains made by a given CS will impact that CS’s contribution to construction of the fungal cell wall.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is an important mediator of metabolism and cell death. Identification of components of the highly conserved mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter has opened it up to genetic analysis in model organisms. Here, we report a comprehensive genetic characterization of all known uniporter components conserved in Drosophila. While loss of pore-forming MCU or EMRE abolishes fast mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, this results in only mild phenotypes when young, despite shortened lifespans. In contrast, loss of the MICU1 gatekeeper is developmentally lethal, consistent with unregulated Ca2+ uptake. Mutants for the neuronally restricted regulator MICU3 are viable with mild neurological impairment. Genetic interaction analyses reveal that MICU1 and MICU3 are not functionally interchangeable. More surprisingly, loss of MCU or EMRE does not suppress MICU1 mutant lethality, suggesting that this results from uniporter-independent functions. Our data reveal the interplay among components of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and shed light on their physiological requirements in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Cytosolic DNA activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), an innate immune sensor pivotal in anti-microbial defense, senescence, auto-immunity, and cancer. cGAS is considered to be a sequence-independent DNA sensor with limited access to nuclear DNA because of compartmentalization. However, the nuclear envelope is a dynamic barrier, and cGAS is present in the nucleus. Here, we identify determinants of nuclear cGAS localization and activation. We show that nuclear-localized cGAS synthesizes cGAMP and induces innate immune activation of dendritic cells, although cGAMP levels are 200-fold lower than following transfection with exogenous DNA. Using cGAS ChIP-seq and a GFP-cGAS knockin mouse, we find nuclear cGAS enrichment on centromeric satellite DNA, confirmed by imaging, and to a lesser extent on LINE elements. The non-enzymatic N-terminal domain of cGAS determines nucleo-cytoplasmic localization, enrichment on centromeres, and activation of nuclear-localized cGAS. These results reveal a preferential functional association of nuclear cGAS with centromeres.

Abstract: Summary
The awake cortex exhibits diverse non-rhythmic network states. However, how these states emerge and how each state impacts network function is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that model networks of spiking neurons with moderate recurrent interactions display a spectrum of non-rhythmic asynchronous dynamics based on the level of afferent excitation, from afferent input-dominated (AD) regimes, characterized by unbalanced synaptic currents and sparse firing, to recurrent input-dominated (RD) regimes, characterized by balanced synaptic currents and dense firing. The model predicted regime-specific relationships between different neural biophysical properties, which were all experimentally validated in the somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake mice. Moreover, AD regimes more precisely encoded spatiotemporal patterns of presynaptic activity, while RD regimes better encoded the strength of afferent inputs. These results provide a theoretical foundation for how recurrent neocortical circuits generate non-rhythmic waking states and how these different states modulate the processing of incoming information.

Abstract: Summary
Combinatorial interactions among transcription factors (TFs) play essential roles in generating gene expression specificity and diversity in metazoans. Using yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) assays on nearly all sequence-specific Drosophila TFs, we identified 1,983 protein-protein interactions (PPIs), more than doubling the number of currently known PPIs among Drosophila TFs. For quality assessment, we validated a subset of our interactions using MITOMI and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. We combined our interactome with prior PPI data to generate an integrated Drosophila TF-TF binary interaction network. Our analysis of ChIP-seq data, integrating PPI and gene expression information, uncovered different modes by which interacting TFs are recruited to DNA. We further demonstrate the utility of our Drosophila interactome in shedding light on human TF-TF interactions. This study reveals how TFs interact to bind regulatory elements in vivo and serves as a resource of Drosophila TF-TF binary PPIs for understanding tissue-specific gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The plasticity of a preexisting regulatory circuit compromises the effectiveness of targeted therapies, and leveraging genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cells may overcome such adaptations. Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is characterized by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiency caused by fumarate hydratase (FH) nullizyogosity. To identify metabolic genes that are synthetically lethal with OXPHOS deficiency, we conducted a genetic loss-of-function screen and found that phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) inhibition robustly blocks the proliferation of FH mutant cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PGD inhibition blocks glycolysis, suppresses reductive carboxylation of glutamine, and increases the NADP+/NADPH ratio to disrupt redox homeostasis. Furthermore, in the OXPHOS-proficient context, blocking OXPHOS using the small-molecule inhibitor IACS-010759 enhances sensitivity to PGD inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Together, our study reveals a dependency on PGD in OXPHOS-deficient tumors that might inform therapeutic intervention in specific patient populations.

Abstract: Summary
During cerebellar development, granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) proliferate by transducing Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling via the primary cilium. Precise regulation of ciliogenesis, thus, ensures proper GNP pool expansion. Here, we report that Atoh1, a transcription factor required for GNPs formation, controls the presence of primary cilia, maintaining GNPs responsiveness to SHH. Loss of primary cilia abolishes the ability of Atoh1 to keep GNPs in a proliferative state. Mechanistically, Atoh1 promotes ciliogenesis by transcriptionally regulating Cep131, which facilitates centriolar satellite (CS) clustering to the basal body. Importantly, ectopic expression of Cep131 counteracts the effects of Atoh1 loss in GNPs by restoring proper localization of CS and ciliogenesis. This Atoh1-CS-primary cilium-SHH pro-proliferative pathway is also conserved in SHH-type medulloblastoma, a pediatric brain tumor arising from the GNPs. Together, our data reveal how Atoh1 modulates the primary cilium to regulate GNPs development.

Noncanonical Modulation of the eIF2 Pathway Controls an Increase in Local Translation during Neural Wiring,

Abstract: Summary
Local translation is rapidly regulated by extrinsic signals during neural wiring, but its control mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that the extracellular cue Sema3A induces an initial burst in local translation that precisely controls phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α via the unfolded protein response (UPR) kinase PERK. Strikingly, in contrast to canonical UPR signaling, Sema3A-induced eIF2α phosphorylation bypasses global translational repression and underlies an increase in local translation through differential activity of eIF2B mediated by protein phosphatase 1. Ultrasensitive proteomics analysis of axons reveals 75 proteins translationally controlled via the Sema3A-p-eIF2α pathway. These include proteostasis- and actin cytoskeleton-related proteins but not canonical stress markers. Finally, we show that PERK signaling is needed for directional axon migration and visual pathway development in vivo. Thus, our findings reveal a noncanonical eIF2 signaling pathway that controls selective changes in axon translation and is required for neural wiring.

Regulation of Ca2+ signaling by acute hypoxia and acidosis in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells,

Abstract: Aims
The effects of acute (100 s) hypoxia and/or acidosis on Ca2+ signaling parameters of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) are explored here for the first time.
Methods and results
1) hiPSC-CMs express two cell populations: rapidly-inactivating ICa myocytes (τi<40 ms, in 4–5 day cultures) and slowly-inactivating ICa (τi  ≥ 40 ms, in 6–8 day cultures). 2) Hypoxia suppressed ICa by 10–20% in rapidly- and 40–55% in slowly-inactivating ICa cells. 3) Isoproterenol enhanced ICa in hiPSC-CMs, but either enhanced or did not alter the hypoxic suppression. 4) Hypoxia had no differential suppressive effects in the two cell-types when Ba2+ was the charge carrier through the calcium channels, implicating Ca2+-dependent inactivation in O2 sensing. 5) Acidosis suppressed ICa by ∼35% and ∼25% in rapidly and slowly inactivating ICa cells, respectively. 6) Hypoxia and acidosis suppressive effects on Ca-transients depended on whether global or RyR2-microdomain were measured: with acidosis suppression was ∼25% in global and ∼37% in RyR2 Ca2+-microdomains in either cell type, whereas with hypoxia suppression was ∼20% and ∼25% respectively in global and RyR2-microdomaine in rapidly and ∼35% and ∼45% respectively in global and RyR2-microdomaine in slowly-inactivating cells.
Conclusions
Variability in ICa inactivation kinetics rather than cellular ancestry seems to underlie the action potential morphology differences generally attributed to mixed atrial and ventricular cell populations in hiPSC-CMs cultures. The differential hypoxic regulation of Ca2+-signaling in the two-cell types arises from differential Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the Ca2+-channel caused by proximity of Ca2+-release stores to the Ca2+ channels.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ play important roles in development, physiology, and tumorigenesis and are negatively controlled by the Hippo pathway. It is yet unknown why the YAP/ TAZ proteins are frequently activated in human malignancies in which the Hippo pathway is still active. Here, by a gain-of-function cancer metastasis screen, we discovered OTUB2 as a cancer stemness and metastasis-promoting factor that deubiquitinates and activates YAP/TAZ. We found OTUB2 to be poly-SUMOylated on lysine 233, and this SUMOylation enables it to bind YAP/TAZ. We also identified a yet-unknown SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in YAP and TAZ required for their association with SUMOylated OTUB2. Importantly, EGF and oncogenic KRAS induce OTUB2 poly-SUMOylation and thereby activate YAP/TAZ. Our results establish OTUB2 as an essential modulator of YAP/TAZ and also reveal a novel mechanism via which YAP/TAZ activity is induced by oncogenic KRAS.

Abstract: Summary
FTO, an mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase, was reported to promote leukemogenesis. Using structure-based rational design, we have developed two promising FTO inhibitors, namely FB23 and FB23-2, which directly bind to FTO and selectively inhibit FTO's m6A demethylase activity. Mimicking FTO depletion, FB23-2 dramatically suppresses proliferation and promotes the differentiation/apoptosis of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line cells and primary blast AML cells in vitro. Moreover, FB23-2 significantly inhibits the progression of human AML cell lines and primary cells in xeno-transplanted mice. Collectively, our data suggest that FTO is a druggable target and that targeting FTO by small-molecule inhibitors holds potential to treat AML.
