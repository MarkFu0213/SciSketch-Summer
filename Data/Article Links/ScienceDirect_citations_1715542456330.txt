Abstract: Summary
Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are degraded by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Although ERAD components involved in degradation of luminal substrates are well characterized, much less is known about quality control of membrane proteins. Here, we analyzed the degradation pathways of two short-lived ER membrane model proteins in mammalian cells. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide library screen, we identified an ERAD branch required for quality control of a subset of membrane proteins. Using biochemical and mass spectrometry approaches, we showed that this ERAD branch is defined by an ER membrane complex consisting of the ubiquitin ligase RNF185, the ubiquitin-like domain containing proteins TMUB1/2 and TMEM259/Membralin, a poorly characterized protein. This complex cooperates with cytosolic ubiquitin ligase UBE3C and p97 ATPase in degrading their membrane substrates. Our data reveal that ERAD branches have remarkable specificity for their membrane substrates, suggesting that multiple, perhaps combinatorial, determinants are involved in substrate selection.

Abstract: Coptisine is an alkaloid with many biological functions, but studies on its mechanism in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury are less reported. Hypoxia–reoxygenation (H/R) -treated cardiomyocytes injury and I/R-induced myocardial tissues damage were created in rat models with or without the pre-treatment of coptisine. The proliferation and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and changes of myocardial tissues were observed after the pre-treatment of coptisine. The pre-treatment of coptisine promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of H/R-injured cardiomyocytes, and alleviated the myocardial tissue injury caused by I/R in rats. Moreover, coptisine promoted the expressions of anti-apoptotic proteins and inhibited the expressions of pro-apoptotic proteins in vivo and in vitro. The current study found that coptisine had protective effects on I/R-induced myocardial damage, which may provide a new insight into the treatment of I/R.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial tube formation on a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) is a well-established in vitro model for studying the processes of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. However, to date, the organizing principles that underlie the morphogenesis of this network and that shape the initial process of cells’ finding one another remain elusive. Here, we identify a mechanism that allows cells to form networks by mechanically reorganizing and stiffening their extracellular matrix, independent of chemical guidance cues. Interestingly, we find that this cellular self-organization strongly depends on the connectivity, plasticity, and topology of the surrounding matrix; cell contractility; and cell density. Cells rearrange the matrix and form bridges of matrix material that are stiffer than their surroundings, thus creating a durotactic track for the initiation of cell protrusions and cell-cell contacts. This contractility-based communication via strain stiffening and matrix rearrangement might be a general organizing principle during tissue development or regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Intake of fructose-containing sugars is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome. Compared with other sugars, dietary fructose is uniquely metabolized by fructokinase. However, the tissue-specific role of fructokinase in sugar-induced metabolic syndrome, and the specific roles of glucose and fructose in driving it, is not fully understood. Here, we show that in mice receiving excess fructose-glucose solutions, whole-body deletion of fructokinase, and thus full blockade of fructose metabolism, is sufficient to prevent metabolic syndrome. This protection is not only due to reduced fructose metabolism, but also due to decreased sugar intake. Furthermore, by using tissue-specific fructokinase-deficient mice, we determined that while sugar intake is controlled by intestinal fructokinase activity, metabolic syndrome is driven by fructose metabolism in the liver. Our findings show a two-pronged role for fructose metabolism in sugar-induced metabolic syndrome, one arm via the intestine that mediates sugar intake and a second arm in the liver that drives metabolic dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Epicardial cells are cardiac progenitors that give rise to the majority of cardiac fibroblasts, coronary smooth muscle cells, and pericytes during development. An integral phase of epicardial fate transition is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that confers motility. We uncover an essential role for the protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in epicardial invasion and differentiation. Using scRNA-seq, we show that epicardial-specific deletion of Prmt1 reduced matrix and ribosomal gene expression in epicardial-derived cell lineages. PRMT1 regulates splicing of Mdm4, which is a key controller of p53 stability. Loss of PRMT1 leads to accumulation of p53 that enhances Slug degradation and blocks EMT. During heart development, the PRMT1-p53 pathway is required for epicardial invasion and formation of epicardial-derived lineages: cardiac fibroblasts, coronary smooth muscle cells, and pericytes. Consequently, this pathway modulates ventricular morphogenesis and coronary vessel formation. Altogether, our study reveals molecular mechanisms involving the PRMT1-p53 pathway and establish its roles in heart development.

Abstract: Summary
Adult stem cells are essential for tissue regeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying the activation of quiescent adult stem cells remain elusive. Using skeletal muscle stem cells, also called satellite cells (SCs), we demonstrate prevalent intron retention (IR) in the transcriptome of quiescent SCs (QSCs). Intron-retained transcripts found in QSCs are essential for fundamental functions including RNA splicing, protein translation, cell-cycle entry, and lineage specification. Further analysis reveals that phosphorylated Dek protein modulates IR during SC quiescence exit. While Dek protein is absent in QSCs, Dek overexpression in vivo results in a global decrease of IR, quiescence dysregulation, premature differentiation of QSCs, and undermined muscle regeneration. Moreover, IR analysis on hundreds of public RNA-seq data show that IR is conserved among quiescent adult stem cells. Altogether, we illustrate IR as a conserved post-transcriptional regulation mechanism that plays an important role during stem cell quiescence exit.

Abstract: Summary
The loss of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is a primary driver of age-related tissue dysfunction. Recent studies have revealed that the failure of proteostasis with age is triggered by developmental and reproductive cues that repress the activity of proteostasis-related pathways in early adulthood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, reduced mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function during development can override signals that promote proteostasis collapse in aged tissues. However, it is unclear precisely how these beneficial effects are mediated. Here, we reveal that in response to ETC impairment, the PP2A complex generates a dephosphorylated, mitochondrial stress-specific variant of the transcription factor HSF-1. This results in the selective induction of small heat shock proteins in adulthood, thereby protecting against age-related proteostasis collapse. We propose that mitochondrial signals early in life can protect the aging cytosolic proteome by tailoring HSF-1 activity to preferentially drive the expression of non-ATP-dependent chaperones.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular differentiation requires dramatic changes in chromatin organization, transcriptional regulation, and protein production. To understand the regulatory connections between these processes, we generated proteomic, transcriptomic, and chromatin accessibility data during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into postmitotic neurons and found extensive associations between different molecular layers within and across differentiation time points. We observed that SOX2, as a regulator of pluripotency and neuronal genes, redistributes from pluripotency enhancers to neuronal promoters during differentiation, likely driven by changes in its protein interaction network. We identified ATRX as a major SOX2 partner in neurons, whose co-localization correlated with an increase in active enhancer marks and increased expression of nearby genes, which we experimentally confirmed for three loci. Collectively, our data provide key insights into the regulatory transformation of SOX2 during neuronal differentiation, and we highlight the significance of multi-omic approaches in understanding gene regulation in complex systems.

Abstract: Summary
At the presynaptic active zone, action-potential-triggered neurotransmitter release requires that fusion-competent synaptic vesicles are placed next to Ca2+ channels. The active zone resident proteins RIM, RBP, and Munc13 are essential contributors for vesicle priming and Ca2+-channel recruitment. Although the individual contributions of these scaffolds have been extensively studied, their respective functions in neurotransmission are still incompletely understood. Here, we analyze the functional interactions of RIMs, RBPs, and Munc13s at the genetic, molecular, functional, and ultrastructural levels in a mammalian synapse. We find that RBP, together with Munc13, promotes vesicle priming at the expense of RBP’s role in recruiting presynaptic Ca2+ channels, suggesting that the support of RBP for vesicle priming and Ca2+-secretion coupling is mutually exclusive. Our results demonstrate that the functional interaction of RIM, RBP, and Munc13 is more profound than previously envisioned, acting as a functional trio that govern basic and short-term plasticity properties of neurotransmission.

Abstract: Summary
BAX is a pro-apoptotic protein that transforms from a cytosolic monomer into a toxic oligomer that permeabilizes the mitochondrial outer membrane. How BAX monomers assemble into a higher-order conformation, and the structural determinants essential to membrane permeabilization, remain a mechanistic mystery. A key hurdle has been the inability to generate a homogeneous BAX oligomer (BAXO) for analysis. Here, we report the production and characterization of a full-length BAXO that recapitulates physiologic BAX activation. Multidisciplinary studies revealed striking conformational consequences of oligomerization and insight into the macromolecular structure of oligomeric BAX. Importantly, BAXO enabled the assignment of specific roles to particular residues and α helices that mediate individual steps of the BAX activation pathway, including unexpected functionalities of BAX α6 and α9 in driving membrane disruption. Our results provide the first glimpse of a full-length and functional BAXO, revealing structural requirements for the elusive execution phase of mitochondrial apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
STING gain-of-function causes autoimmunity and immunodeficiency in mice and STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) in humans. Here, we report that STING gain-of-function in mice prevents development of lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches. We show that the absence of secondary lymphoid organs is associated with diminished numbers of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), including lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells. Although wild-type (WT) α4β7+ progenitors differentiate efficiently into LTi cells, STING gain-of-function progenitors do not. Furthermore, STING gain-of-function impairs development of all types of ILCs. Patients with STING gain-of-function mutations have fewer ILCs, although they still have lymph nodes. In mice, expression of the STING mutant in RORγT-positive lineages prevents development of lymph nodes and reduces numbers of LTi cells. RORγT lineage-specific expression of STING gain-of-function also causes lung disease. Since RORγT is expressed exclusively in LTi cells during fetal development, our findings suggest that STING gain-of-function prevents lymph node organogenesis by reducing LTi cell numbers in mice.

Abstract: Summary
The level of SETD2-mediated H3K36me3 is inversely correlated with that of EZH2-catalyzed H3K27me3. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether these two enzymatic activities are molecularly intertwined. Here, we report that SETD2 delays prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis via its substrate EZH2. We show that SETD2 methylates EZH2 which promotes EZH2 degradation. SETD2 deficiency induces a Polycomb-repressive chromatin state that enables cells to acquire metastatic traits. Conversely, mice harboring nonmethylated EZH2 mutant or SETD2 mutant defective in binding to EZH2 develop metastatic PCa. Furthermore, we identify that metformin-stimulated AMPK signaling converges at FOXO3 to stimulate SETD2 expression. Together, our results demonstrate that the SETD2-EZH2 axis integrates metabolic and epigenetic signaling to restrict PCa metastasis.

Abstract: Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 from rattlesnakes (rsTRPA1) and boas (bTRPA1) was previously proposed to underlie thermo-sensitive infrared sensing based on transcript enrichment in infrared-sensing neurons and hyper-thermosensitivity expressed in Xenopus oocytes. It is unknown how these TRPA1s show thermosensitivities that overwhelm other thermoreceptors, and why rsTRPA1 is more thermosensitive than bTRPA1. Here, we show that snake TRPA1s differentially require Ca2+ for hyper-thermosensitivity and that predisposition to cytosolic Ca2+ potentiation correlates with superior thermosensitivity. Extracellularly applied Ca2+ upshifted the temperature coefficients (Q10s) of both TRPA1s, for which rsTRPA1, but not bTRPA1, requires cytosolic Ca2+. Intracellular Ca2+ chelation and substitutive mutations of the conserved cytosolic Ca2+-binding domain lowered rsTRPA1 thermosensitivity comparable to that of bTRPA1. Thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+ or calmodulin little affected rsTRPA1 activity or thermosensitivity, implying the importance of precise spatiotemporal action of Ca2+. Remarkably, a single rattlesnake-mimicking substitution in the conserved but presumably dormant cytosolic Ca2+-binding domain of bTRPA1 substantially enhanced thermosensitivity through cytosolic Ca2+ like rsTRPA1, indicating the capability of this single site in the determination of both cytosolic Ca2+ dependence and thermosensitivity. Collectively, these data suggest that Ca2+ is essential for the hyper-thermosensitivity of these TRPA1s, and cytosolic potentiation by permeating Ca2+ may contribute to the natural variation of infrared senses between rattlesnakes and boas.

Abstract: Summary
A comprehensive understanding of the phenotype of persistent HIV-infected cells, transcriptionally active and/or transcriptionally inactive, is imperative for developing a cure. The relevance of cell-surface glycosylation to HIV persistence has never been explored. We characterize the relationship between cell-surface glycomic signatures and persistent HIV transcription in vivo. We find that the cell surface of CD4+ T cells actively transcribing HIV, despite suppressive therapy, harbors high levels of fucosylated carbohydrate ligands, including the cell extravasation mediator Sialyl-LewisX (SLeX), compared with HIV-infected transcriptionally inactive cells. These high levels of SLeX are induced by HIV transcription in vitro and are maintained after therapy in vivo. Cells with high-SLeX are enriched with markers associated with HIV susceptibility, signaling pathways that drive HIV transcription, and pathways involved in leukocyte extravasation. We describe a glycomic feature of HIV-infected transcriptionally active cells that not only differentiates them from their transcriptionally inactive counterparts but also may affect their trafficking abilities.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of pancreatic β-cells to respond to increased demands for insulin during metabolic stress critically depends on proper ribosome homeostasis and function. Excessive and long-lasting stimulation of insulin secretion can elicit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response, and β-cell apoptosis. Here we show that the diabetes susceptibility gene JAZF1 is a key transcriptional regulator of ribosome biogenesis, global protein, and insulin translation. JAZF1 is excluded from the nucleus, and its expression levels are reduced upon metabolic stress and in diabetes. Genetic deletion of Jazf1 results in global impairment of protein synthesis that is mediated by defects in ribosomal protein synthesis, ribosomal RNA processing, and aminoacyl-synthetase expression, thereby inducing ER stress and increasing β-cell susceptibility to apoptosis. Importantly, JAZF1 function and its pleiotropic actions are impaired in islets of murine T2D and in human islets exposed to metabolic stress. Our study identifies JAZF1 as a central mediator of metabolic stress in β-cells.

Abstract: Leaf senescence is a developmental process by which a plant actively remobilizes nutrients from aged and photosynthetically inefficient leaves to young growing ones by disassembling organelles and degrading macromolecules. Senescence is accelerated by age and environmental stresses such as prolonged darkness. Phytochrome B (phyB) inhibits leaf senescence by inhibiting phytochrome-interacting factor 4 (PIF4) and PIF5 in prolonged darkness. However, it remains unknown whether phyB mediates the temperature signal that regulates leaf senescence. We found the light-activated form of phyB (Pfr) remains active at least four days after a transfer to darkness at 20°C but is inactivated more rapidly at 28°C. This faster inactivation of Pfr further increases PIF4 protein levels at the higher ambient temperature. In addition, PIF4 mRNA levels rise faster after the transfer to darkness at high ambient temperature via a mechanism that depends on ELF3 but not phyB. Increased PIF4 protein then binds to the ORE1 promoter and activates its expression together with ABA and ethylene signaling, accelerating leaf senescence at high ambient temperature. Our results support a role for the phy-PIF signaling module in integrating not only light signaling but also temperature signaling in the regulation of leaf senescence.

Abstract: The Gustatory system enables animals to detect toxic bitter chemicals, which is critical for insects to survive food induced toxicity. Cucurbitacin is widely present in plants such as cucumber and gourds that acts as an anti-herbivore chemical and an insecticide. Cucurbitacin has a harmful effect on insect larvae as well. Although various beneficial effects of cucurbitacin such as alleviating hyperglycemia have also been documented, it is not clear what kinds of molecular sensors are required to detect cucurbitacin in nature. Cucurbitacin B, a major bitter component of bitter melon, was applied to induce action potentials from sensilla of a mouth part of the fly, labellum. Here we identify that only Gr33a is required for activating bitter-sensing gustatory receptor neurons by cucurbitacin B among available 26 Grs, 23 Irs, 11 Trp mutants, and 26 Gr-RNAi lines. We further investigated the difference between control and Gr33a mutant by analyzing binary food choice assay. We also measured toxic effect of Cucurbitacin B over 0.01 mM range. Our findings uncover the molecular sensor of cucurbitacin B in Drosophila melanogaster. We propose that the discarded shell of Cucurbitaceae can be developed to make a new insecticide.

However, the role of YAP in macrophages during atherosclerosis and its mechanism of YAP activation remain unknown. Here, we find that YAP overexpression in myeloid cells aggravates atherosclerotic lesion size and infiltration of macrophages, whereas YAP deficiency reduces atherosclerotic plaque. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a downstream effector of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), triggers YAP ubiquitination at K252, which interrupts the interaction between YAP and angiomotin and results in enhanced YAP nuclear translocation. The recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra reduces atherosclerotic lesion formation, which is abrogated by YAP overexpression. YAP level is increased in human and mouse atherosclerotic vessels, and plasma IL-1β level in patients with STEMI is correlated with YAP protein level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These findings elucidate a mechanism of YAP activation, which might be a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Liquid-liquid phase-separated (LLPS) states are key to compartmentalizing components in the absence of membranes; however, it is unclear whether LLPS condensates are actively and specifically organized in the subcellular space and by which mechanisms. Here, we address this question by focusing on the ParABS DNA segregation system, composed of a centromeric-like sequence (parS), a DNA-binding protein (ParB), and a motor (ParA). We show that parS and ParB associate to form nanometer-sized, round condensates. ParB molecules diffuse rapidly within the nucleoid volume but display confined motions when trapped inside ParB condensates. Single ParB molecules are able to rapidly diffuse between different condensates, and nucleation is strongly favored by parS. Notably, the ParA motor is required to prevent the fusion of ParB condensates. These results describe a novel active mechanism that splits, segregates, and localizes non-canonical LLPS condensates in the subcellular space.

Abstract: Summary
Afadin, a scaffold protein controlling the activity of the nectin family of cell adhesion molecules, regulates important morphogenetic processes during development. In the central nervous system, afadin has critical roles in neuronal migration, axonal elongation, and synapse formation. Here we examine the role of afadin in development of spinal motor circuits. Afadin elimination in motor neuron progenitors results in striking locomotor behavior: left-right limb alternation is substituted by synchronous activation, characteristic of bound gait. We find that afadin function at the neuroepithelium is required for structural organization of the spinal midline and central canal morphogenesis. Perturbation of afadin results in formation of two central canals, aberrant contralateral wiring of different classes of spinal premotor interneurons, and loss of left-right limb alternation, highlighting important developmental principles controlling the assembly of spinal motor circuits.

Abstract: Summary
G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels are essential effectors of inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. GIRK channels have been implicated in diseases with abnormal neuronal excitability, including epilepsy and addiction. GIRK channels are tetramers composed of either the same subunit (e.g., homotetramers) or different subunits (e.g., heterotetramers). Compounds that specifically target subsets of GIRK channels in vivo are lacking. Previous studies have shown that alcohol directly activates GIRK channels through a hydrophobic pocket located in the cytoplasmic domain of the channel. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a GIRK1-selective activator, termed GiGA1, that targets the alcohol pocket. GiGA1 activates GIRK1/GIRK2 both in vitro and in vivo and, in turn, mitigates the effects of a convulsant in an acute epilepsy mouse model. These results shed light on the structure-based development of subunit-specific GIRK modulators that could provide potential treatments for brain disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are important immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Dysfunctions of gene-deficient microglia contribute to the development and progression of multiple CNS diseases. Microglia replacement by nonself cells has been proposed to treat microglia-associated disorders. However, some attempts have failed due to low replacement efficiency, such as with the traditional bone marrow transplantation approach. In this study, we develop three efficient strategies for microglia replacement: microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (mrBMT), microglia replacement by peripheral blood (mrPB), and microglia replacement by microglia transplantation (mrMT). mrBMT and mrPB allow microglia-like cells to efficiently replace resident microglia in the whole CNS. On the other hand, mrMT achieves microglia replacement in brain regions of interest. In summary, the present study offers effective tactics for microglia replacement with diverse application scenarios, which potentially opens up a window on treating microglia-associated CNS disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid rafts form signaling platforms on biological membranes with incompletely characterized role in immune response to infection. Here we report that lipid-raft microdomains are essential components of phagolysosomal membranes of macrophages and depend on flotillins. Genetic deletion of flotillins demonstrates that the assembly of both major defense complexes vATPase and NADPH oxidase requires membrane microdomains. Furthermore, we describe a virulence mechanism leading to dysregulation of membrane microdomains by melanized wild-type conidia of the important human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus resulting in reduced phagolysosomal acidification. We show that phagolysosomes with ingested melanized conidia contain a reduced amount of free Ca2+ ions and that inhibition of Ca2+-dependent calmodulin activity led to reduced lipid-raft formation. We identify a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human FLOT1 gene resulting in heightened susceptibility for invasive aspergillosis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Collectively, flotillin-dependent microdomains on the phagolysosomal membrane play an essential role in protective antifungal immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Characterizing the tissue-specific binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) is essential to reconstruct gene regulatory networks and predict functions for non-coding genetic variation. DNase-seq footprinting enables the prediction of genome-wide binding sites for hundreds of TFs simultaneously. Despite the public availability of high-quality DNase-seq data from hundreds of samples, a comprehensive, up-to-date resource for the locations of genomic footprints is lacking. Here, we develop a scalable footprinting workflow using two state-of-the-art algorithms: Wellington and HINT. We apply our workflow to detect footprints in 192 ENCODE DNase-seq experiments and predict the genomic occupancy of 1,515 human TFs in 27 human tissues. We validate that these footprints overlap true-positive TF binding sites from ChIP-seq. We demonstrate that the locations, depth, and tissue specificity of footprints predict effects of genetic variants on gene expression and capture a substantial proportion of genetic risk for complex traits.

Abstract: Summary
Evolutionarily conserved SCAN (named after SRE-ZBP, CTfin51, AW-1, and Number 18 cDNA)-domain-containing zinc finger transcription factors (ZSCAN) have been found in both mouse and human genomes. Zscan4 is transiently expressed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in preimplantation embryos and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming. However, little is known about the mechanism of Zscan4 underlying these processes of cell fate control. Here, we show that Zscan4f, a representative of ZSCAN proteins, is able to recruit Tet2 through its SCAN domain. The Zscan4f-Tet2 interaction promotes DNA demethylation and regulates the expression of target genes, particularly those encoding glycolytic enzymes and proteasome subunits. Zscan4f regulates metabolic rewiring, enhances proteasome function, and ultimately promotes iPSC generation. These results identify Zscan4f as an important partner of Tet2 in regulating target genes and promoting iPSC generation and suggest a possible and common mechanism shared by SCAN family transcription factors to recruit ten-eleven translocation (TET) DNA dioxygenases to regulate diverse cellular processes, including reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal hyperactivity is an early primary dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in humans and animal models, but effective neuronal hyperactivity-directed anti-AD therapeutic agents are lacking. Here we define a previously unknown mode of ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) control of neuronal hyperactivity and AD progression. We show that a single RyR2 point mutation, E4872Q, which reduces RyR2 open time, prevents hyperexcitability, hyperactivity, memory impairment, neuronal cell death, and dendritic spine loss in a severe early-onset AD mouse model (5xFAD). The RyR2-E4872Q mutation upregulates hippocampal CA1-pyramidal cell A-type K+ current, a well-known neuronal excitability control that is downregulated in AD. Pharmacologically limiting RyR2 open time with the R-carvedilol enantiomer (but not racemic carvedilol) prevents and rescues neuronal hyperactivity, memory impairment, and neuron loss even in late stages of AD. These AD-related deficits are prevented even with continued β-amyloid accumulation. Thus, limiting RyR2 open time may be a hyperactivity-directed, non-β-amyloid-targeted anti-AD strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Auditory inner hair cells (IHCs) convert sound vibrations into receptor potentials that drive synaptic transmission. For the precise encoding of sound qualities, receptor potentials are shaped by K+ conductances tuning the properties of the IHC membrane. Using patch-clamp and computational modeling, we unravel this membrane specialization showing that IHCs express an exclusive repertoire of six voltage-dependent K+ conductances mediated by Kv1.8, Kv7.4, Kv11.1, Kv12.1, and BKCa channels. All channels are active at rest but are triggered differentially during sound stimulation. This enables non-saturating tuning over a far larger potential range than in IHCs expressing fewer current entities. Each conductance contributes to optimizing responses, but the combined activity of all channels synergistically improves phase locking and the dynamic range of intensities that IHCs can encode. Conversely, hypothetical simpler IHCs appear limited to encode only certain aspects (frequency or intensity). The exclusive channel repertoire of IHCs thus constitutes an evolutionary adaptation to encode complex sound through multifaceted receptor potentials.

Abstract: Secreted factors (secretome) of Wharton’s jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSCs) have therapeutic impacts. This study was conducted to investigate the impact of WJMSCs-derived secretome (WJMSCs-Se) in apoptosis and the growth of HT-29 cells. HT-29 cells treated with 25 or 50 μg/mL WJMSCs-Se for 24 h. Colony formation and MTT test was used to assess the proliferation and cytotoxicity of the HT-29 cells. Annexin V/PI staining was done for the assessment of apoptosis. The mRNA expression of important apoptosis-related genes was also examined. In the WJMSCs-Se-treated HT-29 cells, colony numbers and viability percentages were significantly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. Apoptotic and necrotic indexes of WJMSCs-Se-treated HT-29 cells considerably enhanced in comparison to the control. The Caspase-9 and -3 activities were significantly increased in the WJMSCs-Se-exposed HT-29 cells. The mRNA expression of Caspase-9, Caspase-3, and Bax/ Bcl-2 ratio was considerably elevated in the WJMSCs-Se-treated HT-29 cells. Caspase-8 activity and expression of the p53 gene were not affected by the WJMSCs-Se. Taken together, we concluded that WJSCs-Se significantly prevented cell growth and enhanced colon cancer cell death in a concentration-dependent manner mainly through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Local translation allows spatial control of gene expression. Here, we performed a dual protein-mRNA localization screen, using smFISH on 523 human cell lines expressing GFP-tagged genes. 32 mRNAs displayed specific cytoplasmic localizations with local translation at unexpected locations, including cytoplasmic protrusions, cell edges, endosomes, Golgi, the nuclear envelope, and centrosomes, the latter being cell-cycle-dependent. Automated classification of mRNA localization patterns revealed a high degree of intercellular heterogeneity. Surprisingly, mRNA localization frequently required ongoing translation, indicating widespread co-translational RNA targeting. Interestingly, while P-body accumulation was frequent (15 mRNAs), four mRNAs accumulated in foci that were distinct structures. These foci lacked the mature protein, but nascent polypeptide imaging showed that they were specialized translation factories. For β-catenin, foci formation was regulated by Wnt, relied on APC-dependent polysome aggregation, and led to nascent protein degradation. Thus, translation factories uniquely regulate nascent protein metabolism and create a fine granular compartmentalization of translation.

Abstract: Summary
The meninges are a multilayered structure composed of fibroblasts, blood and lymphatic vessels, and immune cells. Meningeal fibroblasts secrete a variety of factors that control CNS development, yet strikingly little is known about their heterogeneity or development. Using single-cell sequencing, we report distinct transcriptional signatures for fibroblasts in the embryonic dura, arachnoid, and pia. We define new markers for meningeal layers and show conservation in human meninges. We find that embryonic meningeal fibroblasts are transcriptionally distinct between brain regions and identify a regionally localized pial subpopulation marked by the expression of μ-crystallin. Developmental analysis reveals a progressive, ventral-to-dorsal maturation of telencephalic meninges. Our studies have generated an unparalleled view of meningeal fibroblasts, providing molecular profiles of embryonic meningeal fibroblasts by layer and yielding insights into the mechanisms of meninges development and function.

Abstract: Summary
Rigosertib is a styryl benzyl sulfone that inhibits growth of tumor cells and acts as a RAS mimetic by binding to Ras binding domains of RAS effectors. A recent study attributed rigosertib’s mechanism of action to microtubule binding. In that study, rigosertib was obtained from a commercial vendor. We compared the purity of clinical-grade and commercially sourced rigosertib and found that commercially sourced rigosertib contains approximately 5% ON01500, a potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization. Clinical-grade rigosertib, which is free of this impurity, does not exhibit tubulin-binding activity. Cell lines expressing mutant β-tubulin have also been reported to be resistant to rigosertib. However, our study showed that these cells failed to proliferate in the presence of rigosertib at concentrations that are lethal to wild-type cells. Rigosertib induced a senescence-like phenotype in the small percentage of surviving cells, which could be incorrectly scored as resistant using short-term cultures.

Abstract: Summary
Development of specific antiviral agents is an urgent unmet need for SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This study focuses on host proteases that proteolytically activate the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, critical for its fusion after binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as antiviral targets. We first validate cleavage at a putative furin substrate motif at SARS-CoV-2 spikes by expressing it in VeroE6 cells and find prominent syncytium formation. Cleavage and the syncytium are abolished by treatment with the furin inhibitors decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (CMK) and naphthofluorescein, but not by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor camostat. CMK and naphthofluorescein show antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2-infected cells by decreasing virus production and cytopathic effects. Further analysis reveals that, similar to camostat, CMK blocks virus entry, but it further suppresses cleavage of spikes and the syncytium. Naphthofluorescein acts primarily by suppressing viral RNA transcription. Therefore, furin inhibitors may be promising antiviral agents for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiated cells can re-enter the cell cycle to repair tissue damage via a series of discrete morphological and molecular stages coordinated by the cellular energetics regulator mTORC1. We previously proposed the term “paligenosis” to describe this conserved cellular regeneration program. Here, we detail a molecular network regulating mTORC1 during paligenosis in both mouse pancreatic acinar and gastric chief cells. DDIT4 initially suppresses mTORC1 to induce autodegradation of differentiated cell components and damaged organelles. Later in paligenosis, IFRD1 suppresses p53 accumulation. Ifrd1−/− cells do not complete paligenosis because persistent p53 prevents mTORC1 reactivation and cell proliferation. Ddit4−/− cells never suppress mTORC1 and bypass the IFRD1 checkpoint on proliferation. Previous reports and our current data implicate DDIT4/IFRD1 in governing paligenosis in multiple organs and species. Thus, we propose that an evolutionarily conserved, dedicated molecular network has evolved to allow differentiated cells to re-enter the cell cycle (i.e., undergo paligenosis) after tissue injury.

Abstract: Summary
PARP inhibitors (PARPi) cause synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient tumors. Whether specific vulnerabilities to PARPi exist beyond BRCA mutations and related defects in homology-directed repair (HDR) is not well understood. Here, we identify the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIP12 as negative regulator of PARPi sensitivity. We show that TRIP12 controls steady-state PARP1 levels and limits PARPi-induced cytotoxic PARP1 trapping. Upon loss of TRIP12, elevated PARPi-induced PARP1 trapping causes increased DNA replication stress, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TRIP12 binds PARP1 via a central PAR-binding WWE domain and, using its carboxy-terminal HECT domain, catalyzes polyubiquitylation of PARP1, triggering proteasomal degradation and preventing supra-physiological PARP1 accumulation. Further, in cohorts of breast and ovarian cancer patients, PARP1 abundance is negatively correlated with TRIP12 expression. We thus propose TRIP12 as regulator of PARP1 stability and PARPi-induced PARP trapping, with potential implications for PARPi sensitivity and resistance.

Abstract: Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a major taste enhancer that is used as a food additive. Vitamin C (Vit C) and Nigella sativa oil (NSO) are known for their potent antioxidant activities.
Objective
This study investigates the adverse effect of MSG on the thyroid gland and cerebellum of adult male albino rats and the protection against MSG-mediated toxicity provided by Vit C and NSO.
Design
Fifty rats were divided into five groups that were treated via oral gavage. Group I (control) rats received distilled water, Group II rats were treated with MSG (6 mg/gm body weight/day), Group III rats were treated with MSG and Vit C (100 mg/kg body weight /day), Group IV rats were treated with MSG and NSO (50 mg/kg body weight two times per week), and Group V rats were treated with MSG together with both Vit C and NSO with MSG. After 60 days of treatment, rats were euthanized and histological sections were prepared from the thyroid gland and the cerebellum for routine staining and immunohistochemical detection of glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP), Caspase-3 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), respectively. Cerebellar tissue was also evaluated to determine glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels; GSH was also measured in thyroid tissue. Serum levels of fT3, fT4 and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) were also evaluated.
Results
Microscopic examination of cerebellar tissues revealed significant cerebellar injury and cellular apoptosis among the rats in Group II. The thyroid glands of Group II rats were notable for degenerating follicles, loss of colloid, sloughed follicular cells and congested blood vessels. The cerebellar and thyroid tissues from rats in treatment Groups III, IV and V revealed significantly less pathology. Cerebellar and thyroid tissues from Group II rats that were treated with MSG alone revealed intense GFAP and caspase-3 (cerebellar) and PCNA (thyroid) immunoreactivity. Furthermore, cerebellar tissues from rats received MSG alone (Group II) were notable for decreased levels of GSH and increased levels of MDA; thyroid tissue from rats in Group II also demonstrated decreased levels of GSH. Likewise, serum fT3 and fT4 levels were significantly decreased, while serum TSH was significantly increased among rats in Group II. Combined administration of Vit C and NSO together with MSG (Group V) revealed some variations in oxidative parameters compared to those in the Group I control rats.
Conclusions
Oral intake of MSG resulted in degenerative changes in neurons and astrocytes in cerebellum and, also degeneration of the thyroid glands of albino rats. Concomitant administration of Vit C and NSO may limit MSG-induced damage to the cerebellum and thyroid glands and thereby provide significant protection against the oxidative damage induced by MSG.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic cancer is a rare but fatal form of cancer, the fourth highest in absolute mortality. Known risk factors include obesity, diet, and type 2 diabetes; however, the low incidence rate and interconnection of these factors confound the isolation of individual effects. Here, we use epidemiological analysis of prospective human cohorts and parallel tracking of pancreatic cancer in mice to dissect the effects of obesity, diet, and diabetes on pancreatic cancer. Through longitudinal monitoring and multi-omics analysis in mice, we found distinct effects of protein, sugar, and fat dietary components, with dietary sugars increasing Mad2l1 expression and tumor proliferation. Using epidemiological approaches in humans, we find that dietary sugars give a MAD2L1 genotype-dependent increased susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. The translation of these results to a clinical setting could aid in the identification of the at-risk population for screening and potentially harness dietary modification as a therapeutic measure.

Abstract: Summary
Rett syndrome (RTT), mainly caused by mutations in methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), is one of the most prevalent intellectual disorders without effective therapies. Here, we used 2D and 3D human brain cultures to investigate MeCP2 function. We found that MeCP2 mutations cause severe abnormalities in human interneurons (INs). Surprisingly, treatment with a BET inhibitor, JQ1, rescued the molecular and functional phenotypes of MeCP2 mutant INs. We uncovered that abnormal increases in chromatin binding of BRD4 and enhancer-promoter interactions underlie the abnormal transcription in MeCP2 mutant INs, which were recovered to normal levels by JQ1. We revealed cell-type-specific transcriptome impairment in MeCP2 mutant region-specific human brain organoids that were rescued by JQ1. Finally, JQ1 ameliorated RTT-like phenotypes in mice. These data demonstrate that BRD4 dysregulation is a critical driver for RTT etiology and suggest that targeting BRD4 could be a potential therapeutic opportunity for RTT.

Abstract: Summary
The cerebellum is involved in the control of voluntary and autonomic rhythmic behaviors, yet it is unclear to what extent it coordinates these in concert. We studied Purkinje cell activity during unperturbed and perturbed respiration in lobules simplex, crus 1, and crus 2. During unperturbed (eupneic) respiration, complex spike and simple spike activity encode the phase of ongoing sensorimotor processing. In contrast, when the respiratory cycle is perturbed by whisker stimulation, mice concomitantly protract their whiskers and advance their inspiration in a phase-dependent manner, preceded by increased simple spike activity. This phase advancement of respiration in response to whisker stimulation can be mimicked by optogenetic stimulation of Purkinje cells and prevented by cell-specific genetic modification of their AMPA receptors, hampering increased simple spike firing. Thus, the impact of Purkinje cell activity on respiratory control is context and phase dependent, highlighting a coordinating role for the cerebellar hemispheres in aligning autonomic and sensorimotor behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
During aging, there is a progressive loss of volume and function in skeletal muscle that impacts mobility and quality of life. The repair of skeletal muscle is regulated by tissue-resident stem cells called satellite cells (or muscle stem cells [MuSCs]), but in aging, MuSCs decrease in numbers and regenerative capacity. The transcriptional networks and epigenetic changes that confer diminished regenerative function in MuSCs as a result of natural aging are only partially understood. Herein, we use an integrative genomics approach to profile MuSCs from young and aged animals before and after injury. Integration of these datasets reveals aging impacts multiple regulatory changes through significant differences in gene expression, metabolic flux, chromatin accessibility, and patterns of transcription factor (TF) binding activities. Collectively, these datasets facilitate a deeper understanding of the regulation tissue-resident stem cells use during aging and healing.

Abstract: Small hepatocytes (SH) have been identified in regenerative organs and have been proposed to be hepatocyte progenitor cells. Their characteristic presence in birds, and their maturation into functional and mature hepatocytes, have not yet been elucidated. We previously demonstrated the appearance of chicken SH, which express CD44, in a model of chicken hepatopathy treated with bile duct ligation (BDL). We expanded on our previous research and performed a detailed study of the ultrastructure of chicken SH. Four weeks after BDL, we observed chicken SH with high electron density cytoplasm and with colony formation. In the chicken SH, electron microscopical analysis found no formation of tight junctions and no glycogen. Ultrastructural analysis also revealed the existence of various types of chicken SH with characteristics lying between those of chicken SH with colony formation and mature hepatocytes. The analysis of immunoelectron microscopy showed CD44 expressed on the surface of the extensive SH-like cells in the hepatic lamina. These results suggest that the expression of CD44 changes according to the differentiated stage of SH in a chicken BDL model.

Abstract: Summary
RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) contains a disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) whose length enigmatically correlates with genome size. The CTD is crucial to eukaryotic transcription, yet the functional and evolutionary relevance of this variation remains unclear. Here, we investigate how CTD length and disorder influence transcription. We find that length modulates the size and frequency of transcriptional bursting. Disorder is highly conserved and facilitates CTD-CTD interactions, an ability we show is separable from protein sequence and necessary for efficient transcription. We build a data-driven quantitative model, simulations of which recapitulate experiments and support that CTD length promotes initial polymerase recruitment to the promoter and slows down its release from it and that CTD-CTD interactions enable recruitment of multiple polymerases. Our results reveal how these parameters provide access to a range of transcriptional activity, offering a new perspective for the mechanistic significance of CTD length and disorder in transcription across eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) causes severe infections even in healthy individuals by escaping surveillance and killing from polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the first-line leukocytes in bacterial infections; moreover, the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains further limits treatment options. We therefore assess whether multilineage mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), best known for immunomodulation toward T cells, could be therapeutic for highly virulent bacterial infections via modulation of PMNs. We find that both bone marrow MSCs and placental MSCs (PMSCs) preserve in vitro PMN survival, but only PMSCs significantly enhance multiple PMN bactericidal functions, including phagocytosis, through secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). PMSC treatment of hvKP-infected mice suppresses T and natural killer (NK) cell responses as expected but can preferentially recruit PMNs and enhance antibacterial functions to allow for disease survival; IL-1β knockdown in PMSCs significantly decreases hvKP clearance, worsening survival and resulting in 100% lethality. Our data strongly implicate the possible use of PMSCs for infections of PMN-resistant hvKP strains.

Abstract: Summary
Cytosine base editors (CBEs) generate C-to-T nucleotide substitutions in genomic target sites without inducing double-strand breaks. However, CBEs such as BE3 can cause genome-wide off-target changes via sgRNA-independent DNA deamination. By leveraging the orthogonal R-loops generated by SaCas9 nickase to mimic actively transcribed genomic loci that are more susceptible to cytidine deaminase, we set up a high-throughput assay for assessing sgRNA-independent off-target effects of CBEs in rice protoplasts. The reliability of this assay was confirmed by the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 10 base editors in regenerated rice plants. The R-loop assay was used to screen a series of rationally designed A3Bctd-BE3 variants for improved specificity. We obtained 2 efficient CBE variants, A3Bctd-VHM-BE3 and A3Bctd-KKR-BE3, and the WGS analysis revealed that these new CBEs eliminated sgRNA-independent DNA off-target edits in rice plants. Moreover, these 2 base editor variants were more precise at their target sites by producing fewer multiple C edits.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial cell (EC)-derived signals contribute to organ regeneration, but angiocrine metabolic communication is not described. We found that EC-specific loss of the glycolytic regulator pfkfb3 reduced ischemic hindlimb revascularization and impaired muscle regeneration. This was caused by the reduced ability of macrophages to adopt a proangiogenic and proregenerative M2-like phenotype. Mechanistically, loss of pfkfb3 reduced lactate secretion by ECs and lowered lactate levels in the ischemic muscle. Addition of lactate to pfkfb3-deficient ECs restored M2-like polarization in an MCT1-dependent fashion. Lactate shuttling by ECs enabled macrophages to promote proliferation and fusion of muscle progenitors. Moreover, VEGF production by lactate-polarized macrophages was increased, resulting in a positive feedback loop that further stimulated angiogenesis. Finally, increasing lactate levels during ischemia rescued macrophage polarization and improved muscle reperfusion and regeneration, whereas macrophage-specific mct1 deletion prevented M2-like polarization. In summary, ECs exploit glycolysis for angiocrine lactate shuttling to steer muscle regeneration from ischemia.

Abstract: Summary
Morphogen gradients specify cell fates during development, with a classic example being the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) gradient’s conserved role in embryonic dorsal-ventral axis patterning. Here, we elucidate how the BMP gradient is interpreted in the Drosophila embryo by combining live imaging with computational modeling to infer transcriptional burst parameters at single-cell resolution. By comparing burst kinetics in cells receiving different levels of BMP signaling, we show that BMP signaling controls burst frequency by regulating the promoter activation rate. We provide evidence that the promoter activation rate is influenced by both enhancer and promoter sequences, whereas Pol II loading rate is primarily modulated by the enhancer. Consistent with BMP-dependent regulation of burst frequency, the numbers of BMP target gene transcripts per cell are graded across their expression domains. We suggest that graded mRNA output is a general feature of morphogen gradient interpretation and discuss how this can impact on cell-fate decisions.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) robustly proliferate while maintaining multilineage potential in vivo; however, an incomplete understanding of spatiotemporal cues governing their generation has impeded robust production from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in vitro. Using the zebrafish model, we demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin-1-beta (IL1β) signaling drives HSPC production in response to metabolic activity. Genetic induction of active IL1β or pharmacologic inflammasome stimulation increased HSPC number as assessed by in situ hybridization for runx1/cmyb and flow cytometry. Loss of inflammasome components, including il1b, reduced CD41+ HSPCs and prevented their expansion in response to metabolic cues. Cell ablation studies indicated that macrophages were essential for initial inflammasome stimulation of Il1rl1+ HSPCs. Significantly, in human iPSC-derived hemogenic precursors, transient inflammasome stimulation increased multilineage hematopoietic colony-forming units and T cell progenitors. This work establishes the inflammasome as a conserved metabolic sensor that expands HSPC production in vivo and in vitro.

Abstract: The Congjiang Xiang pig is a rare Chinese miniature breed whose epididymal histologic features through the postnatal development are poorly understood. To clarify the histomorphological differences between each region of epididymis during postnatal development, 24 male Congjiang Xiang pigs aged from neonatal (15 d), peri-puberty (30 d), puberty (60 d) to adult (180 d) stages, were examined. Postnatal differentiation of the different regions (I–V) of the epididymis started from birth and continued until maturity that showed regional variations. Developmental progression was disto-proximal. At the neonatal stage, Wolffian duct differentiation starts in the distal region, then ascends to the middle region which forms regions V, IV and III, respectively. A simple lined cuboidal in the epidydimal epithelial, which gradually differentiated into a pseudostratified columnar with stereocilia from neonatal to post-pubertal. After puberty cell rearrangement occurred in the epithelium, differentiation accelerated, and spermatozoon seen in the lumen, especially the lumen of region II. In region III, both halo and apical cells were frequently observed. At the post-pubertal stage, clear cells were frequently observed in Region IV-V, and the epididymal duct was markedly increased in size and fully packed with spermatozoa. The information presented in this study will be helpful for future evaluations of Congjiang Xiang pig fertility.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an endocrine hormone produced by the liver that regulates nutrient and metabolic homeostasis. FGF21 production is increased in response to macronutrient imbalance and signals to the brain to suppress sugar intake and sweet-taste preference. However, the central targets mediating these effects have been unclear. Here, we identify FGF21 target cells in the hypothalamus and reveal that FGF21 signaling to glutamatergic neurons is both necessary and sufficient to mediate FGF21-induced sugar suppression and sweet-taste preference. Moreover, we show that FGF21 acts directly in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) to specifically regulate sucrose intake, but not non-nutritive sweet-taste preference, body weight, or energy expenditure. Finally, our data demonstrate that FGF21 affects neuronal activity by increasing activation and excitability of neurons in the VMH. Thus, FGF21 signaling to glutamatergic neurons in the VMH is an important component of the neurocircuitry that functions to regulate sucrose intake.

Abstract: Summary
Signals driving aberrant self-renewal in the heterogeneous leukemia stem cell (LSC) pool determine aggressiveness of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We report that a positive modulator of canonical WNT signaling pathway, RSPO-LGR4, upregulates key self-renewal genes and is essential for LSC self-renewal in a subset of AML. RSPO2/3 serve as stem cell growth factors to block differentiation and promote proliferation of primary AML patient blasts. RSPO receptor, LGR4, is epigenetically upregulated and works through cooperation with HOXA9, a poor prognostic predictor. Blocking the RSPO3-LGR4 interaction by clinical-grade anti-RSPO3 antibody (OMP-131R10/rosmantuzumab) impairs self-renewal and induces differentiation in AML patient-derived xenografts but does not affect normal hematopoietic stem cells, providing a therapeutic opportunity for HOXA9-dependent leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Protein secretion in eukaryotes and prokaryotes involves a universally conserved protein translocation channel formed by the Sec61 complex. Unrelated small-molecule natural products and synthetic compounds inhibit Sec61 with differential effects for different substrates or for Sec61 from different organisms, making this a promising target for therapeutic intervention. To understand the mode of inhibition and provide insight into the molecular mechanism of this dynamic translocon, we determined the structure of mammalian Sec61 inhibited by the Mycobacterium ulcerans exotoxin mycolactone via electron cryo-microscopy. Unexpectedly, the conformation of inhibited Sec61 is optimal for substrate engagement, with mycolactone wedging open the cytosolic side of the lateral gate. The inability of mycolactone-inhibited Sec61 to effectively transport substrate proteins implies that signal peptides and transmembrane domains pass through the site occupied by mycolactone. This provides a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanism of Sec61 inhibitors and reveals novel features of translocon function and dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
VSV fusion machinery, like that of many other enveloped viruses, is triggered at low pH in endosomes after virion endocytosis. It was suggested that some histidines could play the role of pH-sensitive switches. By mutating histidine residues H22, H60, H132, H162, H389, H397, H407, and H409, we demonstrate that residues H389 and D280, facing each other in the six-helix bundle of the post-fusion state, and more prominently H407, located at the interface between the C-terminal part of the ectodomain and the fusion domain, are crucial for fusion. Passages of recombinant viruses bearing mutant G resulted in the selection of compensatory mutations. Thus, the H407A mutation in G resulted in two independent compensatory mutants, L396I and S422I. Together with a crystal structure of G, presented here, which extends our knowledge of G pre-fusion structure, this indicates that the conformational transition is initiated by refolding of the C-terminal part of the G ectodomain.

Abstract: Summary
Cranial irradiation (IR), an effective tool to treat malignant brain tumors, triggers a chronic pro-inflammatory microglial response, at least in the adult brain. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing, combined with histology, we show that the microglial response in the juvenile mouse hippocampus is rapid but returns toward normal within 1 week. The response is characterized by a series of temporally distinct homeostasis-, sensome-, and inflammation-related molecular signatures. We find that a single microglial cell simultaneously upregulates transcripts associated with pro- and anti-inflammatory microglial phenotypes. Finally, we show that juvenile and adult irradiated microglia are already transcriptionally distinct in the early phase after IR. Our results indicate that microglia are involved in the initial stages but may not be responsible for driving long-term inflammation in the juvenile brain.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are vital for the maintenance of immune homeostasis, while their dysfunction constitutes a cardinal feature of autoimmunity. Under steady-state conditions, mitochondrial metabolism is critical for Treg function; however, the metabolic adaptations of Tregs during autoimmunity are ill-defined. Herein, we report that elevated mitochondrial oxidative stress and a robust DNA damage response (DDR) associated with cell death occur in Tregs in individuals with autoimmunity. In an experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) mouse model of autoimmunity, we found a Treg dysfunction recapitulating the features of autoimmune Tregs with a prominent mtROS signature. Scavenging of mtROS in Tregs of EAE mice reversed the DDR and prevented Treg death, while attenuating the Th1 and Th17 autoimmune responses. These findings highlight an unrecognized role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in defining Treg fate during autoimmunity, which may facilitate the design of novel immunotherapies for diseases with disturbed immune tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
A long-standing conundrum is how mitotic chromosomes can compact, as required for clean separation to daughter cells, while maintaining close parallel alignment of sister chromatids. Pursuit of this question, by high resolution 3D fluorescence imaging of living and fixed mammalian cells, has led to three discoveries. First, we show that the structural axes of separated sister chromatids are linked by evenly spaced “mini-axis” bridges. Second, when chromosomes first emerge as discrete units, at prophase, they are organized as co-oriented sister linear loop arrays emanating from a conjoined axis. We show that this same basic organization persists throughout mitosis, without helical coiling. Third, from prophase onward, chromosomes are deformed into sequential arrays of half-helical segments of alternating handedness (perversions), accompanied by correlated kinks. These arrays fluctuate dynamically over <15 s timescales. Together these discoveries redefine the foundation for thinking about the evolution of mitotic chromosomes as they prepare for anaphase segregation.

Abstract: The migration, dedifferentiation, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are responsible for intimal hyperplasia, but the mechanism of this process has not been elucidated. WD repeat domain 1 (WDR1) promotes actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin-mediated depolymerization of actin filaments (F-actin). The role of WDR1 in neointima formation and progression is still unknown. A model of intimal thickening was constructed by ligating the left common carotid artery in Wdr1 deletion mice, and H&E staining showed that Wdr1 deficiency significantly inhibits neointima formation. We also report that STAT3 promotes the proliferation and migration of VSMCs by directly promoting WDR1 transcription. Mechanistically, we clarified that WDR1 promotes the proliferation and migration of VSMCs and neointima formation is regulated by the activation of the JAK2/STAT3/WDR1 axis.

Abstract: Summary
Stimulation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis in humans has emerged as an attractive target to improve metabolic health. Pharmacological stimulations targeting the β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR), the adrenergic receptor believed to mediate BAT thermogenesis, have historically performed poorly in human clinical trials. Here we report that, in contrast to rodents, human BAT thermogenesis is not mediated by the stimulation of β3-AR. Oral administration of the β3-AR agonist mirabegron only elicited increases in BAT thermogenesis when ingested at the maximal allowable dose. This led to off-target binding to β1-AR and β2-AR, thereby increasing cardiovascular responses and white adipose tissue lipolysis, respectively. ADRB2 was co-expressed with UCP1 in human brown adipocytes. Pharmacological stimulation and inhibition of the β2-AR as well as knockdown of ADRB1, ADRB2, or ADRB3 in human brown adipocytes all confirmed that BAT lipolysis and thermogenesis occur through β2-AR signaling in humans (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02811289).

Abstract: Summary
Transposable elements (TEs) comprise nearly half of the human genome and are often transcribed or exhibit cis-regulatory properties with unknown function in specific processes such as heart development. In the case of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), a TE subclass, experimental interrogation is constrained as many are primate-specific or human-specific. Here, we use primate pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes that mimic fetal cardiomyocytes in vitro to discover hundreds of ERV transcripts from the primate-specific MER41 family, some of which are regulated by the cardiogenic transcription factor TBX5. The most significant of these are located within BANCR, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) exclusively expressed in primate fetal cardiomyocytes. Functional studies reveal that BANCR promotes cardiomyocyte migration in vitro and ventricular enlargement in vivo. We conclude that recently evolved TE loci such as BANCR may represent potent de novo developmental regulatory elements that can be interrogated with species-matching pluripotent stem cell models.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding factors that shape the immune landscape across hematological malignancies is essential for immunotherapy development. We integrated over 8,000 transcriptomes and 2,000 samples with multilevel genomics of hematological cancers to investigate how immunological features are linked to cancer subtypes, genetic and epigenetic alterations, and patient survival, and validated key findings experimentally. Infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes was associated with TP53 and myelodysplasia-related changes in acute myeloid leukemia, and activated B cell-like phenotype and interferon-γ response in lymphoma. CIITA methylation regulating antigen presentation, cancer type-specific immune checkpoints, such as VISTA in myeloid malignancies, and variation in cancer antigen expression further contributed to immune heterogeneity and predicted survival. Our study provides a resource linking immunology with cancer subtypes and genomics in hematological malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
DNA:RNA hybrids play key roles in both physiological and disease states by regulating chromatin and genome organization. Their homeostasis during cell differentiation and cell plasticity remains elusive. Using an isogenic human stem cell platform, we systematically characterize R-loops, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility in pluripotent cells and their lineage-differentiated derivatives. We confirm that a portion of R-loops formed co-transcriptionally at pluripotency genes in pluripotent stem cells and at lineage-controlling genes in differentiated lineages. Notably, a subset of R-loops maintained after differentiation are associated with repressive chromatin marks on silent pluripotency genes and undesired lineage genes. Moreover, in reprogrammed pluripotent cells, cell-of-origin-specific R-loops are initially present but are resolved with serial passaging. Our analysis suggests a multifaceted role of R-loops in cell fate determination that may serve as an additional layer of modulation on cell fate memory and cell plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic analyses in budding yeast have helped define the foundational principles of eukaryotic gene expression. However, in the absence of empirical methods for defining coding regions, these analyses have historically excluded specific classes of possible coding regions, such as those initiating at non-AUG start codons. Here, we applied an experimental approach to globally annotate translation initiation sites in yeast and identified 149 genes with alternative N-terminally extended protein isoforms initiating from near-cognate codons upstream of annotated AUG start codons. These isoforms are produced in concert with canonical isoforms and translated with high specificity, resulting from initiation at only a small subset of possible start codons. The non-AUG initiation driving their production is enriched during meiosis and induced by low eIF5A, which is seen in this context. These findings reveal widespread production of non-canonical protein isoforms and unexpected complexity to the rules by which even a simple eukaryotic genome is decoded.

Abstract: Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide threat to humans, and neutralizing antibodies have therapeutic potential. We have purified more than 1,000 memory B cells specific to SARS-CoV-2 S1 or its RBD (receptor binding domain) and obtain 729 paired heavy- and light-chain fragments. Among these, 178 antibodies test positive for antigen binding, and the majority of the top 17 binders with EC50 below 1 nM are RBD binders. Furthermore, we identify 11 neutralizing antibodies, eight of which show IC50 within 10 nM, and the best one, 414-1, with IC50 of 1.75 nM. Through epitope mapping, we find three main epitopes in RBD recognized by these antibodies, and epitope-B antibody 553-15 could substantially enhance the neutralizing abilities of most of the other antibodies. We also find that 515-5 could cross neutralize the SARS-CoV pseudovirus. Altogether, our study provides 11 potent human neutralizing antibodies for COVID-19 as therapeutic candidates.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that mediate antiviral and antitumor responses and require the transcriptional regulator Eomesodermin (Eomes) for early development. However, the role of Eomes and its molecular program in mature NK cell biology is unclear. To address this, we develop a tamoxifen-inducible, type-1-ILC-specific (Ncr1-targeted) cre mouse and combine this with Eomes-floxed mice. Eomes deletion after normal NK cell ontogeny results in a rapid loss of NK cells (but not ILC1s), with a particularly profound effect on penultimately mature stage III NK cells. Mechanisms responsible for stage III reduction include increased apoptosis and impaired maturation from stage II precursors. Induced Eomes deletion also decreases NK cell cytotoxicity and abrogates in vivo rejection of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-class-I-deficient cells. However, other NK cell functional responses, and stage IV NK cells, are largely preserved. These data indicate that mature NK cells have distinct Eomes-dependent and -independent stages.

Abstract: Summary
Despite their apparent lack of catalytic activity, pseudokinases are essential signaling molecules. Here, we describe the structural and dynamic properties of pseudokinase domains from the Wnt-binding receptor tyrosine kinases (PTK7, ROR1, ROR2, and RYK), which play important roles in development. We determined structures of all pseudokinase domains in this family and found that they share a conserved inactive conformation in their activation loop that resembles the autoinhibited insulin receptor kinase (IRK). They also have inaccessible ATP-binding pockets, occluded by aromatic residues that mimic a cofactor-bound state. Structural comparisons revealed significant domain plasticity and alternative interactions that substitute for absent conserved motifs. The pseudokinases also showed dynamic properties that were strikingly similar to those of IRK. Despite the inaccessible ATP site, screening identified ATP-competitive type-II inhibitors for ROR1. Our results set the stage for an emerging therapeutic modality of “conformational disruptors” to inhibit or modulate non-catalytic functions of pseudokinases deregulated in disease.

Abstract: Summary
The collection of T cell receptors (TCRs) generated by somatic recombination is large but unknown. We generate large TCR repertoire datasets as a resource to facilitate detailed studies of the role of TCR clonotypes and repertoires in health and disease. We estimate the size of individual human recombined and expressed TCRs by sequence analysis and determine the extent of sharing between individual repertoires. Our experiments reveal that each blood sample contains between 5 million and 21 million TCR clonotypes. Three individuals share 8% of TCRβ- or 11% of TCRα-chain clonotypes. Sorting by T cell phenotypes in four individuals shows that 5% of naive CD4+ and 3.5% of naive CD8+ subsets share their TCRβ clonotypes, whereas memory CD4+ and CD8+ subsets share 2.3% and 0.4% of their clonotypes, respectively. We identify the sequences of these shared TCR clonotypes that are of interest for studies of human T cell biology.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cell plasticity, including transdifferentiation, is thought to be a key driver of therapy failure, tumor dormancy, and metastatic dissemination. Although melanoma cells have been shown to adopt various phenotypic features in vitro, direct in vivo evidence of metastatic cell plasticity remains sparse. Here, we combine lineage tracing in a spontaneous metastatic mouse model of melanoma, advanced imaging, and single-cell RNA sequencing approaches to search for pathophysiologically relevant melanoma cellular states. We identify melanoma cells in intravascular niches of various metastatic organs. These cells are quiescent, are negative for characteristic melanoma markers, and acquire endothelial cell features. We replicate the endothelial transdifferentiation (EndT) finding in another mouse model and provide evidence of EndT in BRAFV600E-metastatic biopsies from human lung, brain, and small intestine, thus highlighting the clinical relevance of these findings. The tumor-vasculature pattern described herein may contribute to melanoma dormancy within metastatic organs and represent a putative target for therapies.

Abstract: Autologous fibrin has been widely used in surgical procedures for both soft and hard tissue repair. There are different protocols and devices to obtain this matrix, with varying centrifugal time, gravity force, speed, angle of the sample tube and spinning radius. The aim of this study was to compare three methods of obtaining autologous fibrin: L-PRF using the Intra-Spin L-PRF centrifuge (Dohan protocol), the advanced PRF (A-PRF) using the Intra-Spin L-PRF centrifuge and autologous leukocyte fibrin (ALF), using the Kasvi centrifuge. Venous blood was collected from 7 healthy volunteers, which were submitted to the 3 different methods of centrifugation. The membranes were tissue-processed and evaluated by immunohistochemistry for CD3, CD20, CD68 and CD138. For CD68+, a lower number of cells was immunolabelled in the L-PRF group when compared to the other groups (A-PRF and ALF). For CD3+, a lower number of immunolabellated cells was observed in the ALF group when compared to the remaining groups (p < 0.05). In the A-PRF group, the CD20+ cell count was lower than in the remaining groups. No difference was observed in CD138+ cell counts between the groups. The 3 protocols tested are suitable for obtaining autologous fibrin membranes.

Abstract: Extracellular influx of calcium or release of calcium from intracellular stores have been shown to activate mammalian TRPA1 as well as to sensitize and desensitize TRPA1 electrophilic activation. Calcium binding sites on both intracellular N- and C-termini have been proposed. Here, we demonstrate based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and bilayer patch-clamp studies, a direct calmodulin-independent action of calcium on the purified human TRPA1 (hTRPA1), causing structural changes and activation without immediate subsequent desensitization of hTRPA1 with and without its N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (N-ARD).

Abstract: Summary
Glucose hypometabolism in cortical structures after functional disconnection is frequently reported in patients with white matter diseases such as subcortical stroke. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms have been poorly elucidated. Here we show, in an animal model of internal capsular infarct, that GABA-synthesizing reactive astrocytes in distant cortical areas cause glucose hypometabolism via tonic inhibition of neighboring neurons. We find that reversal of aberrant astrocytic GABA synthesis, by pharmacological inhibition and astrocyte-specific gene silencing of MAO-B, reverses the reduction in cortical glucose metabolism. Moreover, induction of aberrant astrocytic GABA synthesis by cortical injection of putrescine or adenovirus recapitulates cortical hypometabolism. Furthermore, MAO-B inhibition causes a remarkable recovery from post-stroke motor deficits when combined with a rehabilitation regimen. Collectively, our data indicate that cortical glucose hypometabolism in subcortical stroke is caused by aberrant astrocytic GABA and MAO-B inhibition and that attenuating cortical hypometabolism can be a therapeutic approach in subcortical stroke.

Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that metabolic dysfunctions are at the roots of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In particular, defects in cerebral glucose metabolism, which have been often noted even before the occurrence of clinical symptoms and histopathological lesions, are now regarded as critical contributors to the pathogenesis of AD. Hence, the stimulation of energy metabolism, by enhancing the availability of specific metabolites, might be an alternative way to improve ATP synthesis and to positively affect AD progression. For instance, glutamate may serve as an intermediary metabolite for ATP synthesis through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation. We have recently shown that two transporters are critical for the anaplerotic use of glutamate: the Na+-dependent Excitatory Amino Acids Carrier 1 (EAAC1) and the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger 1 (NCX1). Therefore, in the present study, we established an AD-like phenotype by perturbing glucose metabolism in both primary rat cortical neurons and retinoic acid (RA)-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, and we explored the potential of glutamate to halt cell damage by monitoring neurotoxicity, AD markers, ATP synthesis, cytosolic Ca2+ levels and EAAC1/NCX1 functional activities. We found that glutamate significantly increased ATP production and cell survival, reduced the increase of AD biomarkers (amyloid β protein and the hyperphosphorylated form of tau protein), and recovered the increase of NCX reverse-mode activity. The RNA silencing of either EAAC1 or NCX1 caused the loss of the beneficial effects of glutamate, suggesting the requirement of a functional interplay between these transporters for glutamate-induced protection. Remarkably, our results indicate, as proof‐of‐principle, that facilitating the use of alternative fuels, like glutamate, may be an effective approach to overcome deficits in glucose utilization and significantly slow down neuronal degenerative process in AD.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptically released glutamate is largely cleared by glutamate transporters localized on perisynaptic astrocyte processes. Therefore, the substantial variability of astrocyte coverage of individual hippocampal synapses implies that the efficacy of local glutamate uptake and thus the spatial fidelity of synaptic transmission is synapse dependent. By visualization of sub-diffraction-limit perisynaptic astrocytic processes and adjacent postsynaptic spines, we show that, relative to their size, small spines display a stronger coverage by astroglial transporters than bigger neighboring spines. Similarly, glutamate transients evoked by synaptic stimulation are more sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of glutamate uptake at smaller spines, whose high-affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are better shielded from remotely released glutamate. At small spines, glutamate-induced and NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ entry is also more strongly increased by uptake inhibition. These findings indicate that spine size inversely correlates with the efficacy of local glutamate uptake and thereby likely determines the probability of synaptic crosstalk.

Abstract: Summary
Pausing by RNA polymerase (RNAP) during transcription elongation, in which a translocating RNAP uses a “stepping” mechanism, has been studied extensively, but pausing by RNAP during initial transcription, in which a promoter-anchored RNAP uses a “scrunching” mechanism, has not. We report a method that directly defines the RNAP-active-center position relative to DNA with single-nucleotide resolution (XACT-seq; “crosslink-between-active-center-and-template sequencing”). We apply this method to detect and quantify pausing in initial transcription at 411 (∼4,000,000) promoter sequences in vivo in Escherichia coli. The results show initial-transcription pausing can occur in each nucleotide addition during initial transcription, particularly the first 4 to 5 nucleotide additions. The results further show initial-transcription pausing occurs at sequences that resemble the consensus sequence element for transcription-elongation pausing. Our findings define the positional and sequence determinants for initial-transcription pausing and establish initial-transcription pausing is hard coded by sequence elements similar to those for transcription-elongation pausing.

Abstract: Objective
We try to examine the role of transmembrane protein 92 (TMEM92) in the progression of breast carcinoma (BC) and assess its prognostic value. Moreover, the effects of TMEM92 on BC cell phenotypes was explored.
Methods
The levels of TMEM92 in BC tissues were evaluated using bioinformatics analysis according to the Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases. mRNA levels of TMEM92 in BC cells were measured by qRT-PCR. Kaplan-Meier methods together with log-rank tests were used to conduct survival analysis, and chi-square tests were employed to assess the relationship between TMEM92 levels and clinicopathological parameters. Cox regression analysis was carried out to identify the independent prognosticators. Small interference RNA targeted to TMEM92 and plasmid vectors pcDNA3.1-TMEM92 were respectively used to silence and over-express TMEM92. Protein levels of molecules in this study were tested by western blot. Cell viability, invasiveness and motility of BC cells were determined by cell counting kit 8, clone formation assay and Transwell assay, appropriately.
Results
The data showed that TMEM92 was upregulated in BC tissues or cells in comparison with control. High expression of TMEM92 was notably correlated with stage and metastasis, and led to a poor overall survival. Moreover, cox multivariate analysis model demonstrated that TMEM92 can be seen as an independent prognostic factor. Functional experiments demonstrated that downregulation of TMEM92 showed a significantly inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-231 cell viability, invasiveness and motility, whereas overexpression of TMEM92 could promote the changes of these phenotypes. Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed that depletion of TMEM92 inactivated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process with raised E-cadherin protein levels, while declined N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail levels. However, enhancement of TMEM92 showed the opposite outcomes on these EMT-related markers.
Conclusion
TMEM92 had an independent prognostic value for BC patients, and might act as an oncogene to facilitate tumor cells growth, invasiveness and motility by modulating the EMT relative proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The accumulation of senescent cells can drive many age-associated phenotypes and pathologies. Consequently, it has been proposed that removing senescent cells might extend lifespan. Here, we generated two knockin mouse models targeting the best-characterized marker of senescence, p16Ink4a. Using a genetic lineage tracing approach, we found that age-induced p16High senescence is a slow process that manifests around 10–12 months of age. The majority of p16High cells were vascular endothelial cells mostly in liver sinusoids (LSECs), and to lesser extent macrophages and adipocytes. In turn, continuous or acute elimination of p16High senescent cells disrupted blood-tissue barriers with subsequent liver and perivascular tissue fibrosis and health deterioration. Our data show that senescent LSECs are not replaced after removal and have important structural and functional roles in the aging organism. In turn, delaying senescence or replacement of senescent LSECs could represent a powerful tool in slowing down aging.

Abstract: Summary
Combinatorial action of transcription factors (TFs) with partially overlapping expression is a widespread strategy to generate novel gene-expression patterns and, thus, cellular diversity. Known mechanisms underlying combinatorial activity require co-expression of TFs within the same cell. Here, we describe the mechanism by which two TFs that are never co-expressed generate a new, intersectional expression pattern in C. elegans embryos: lineage-specific priming of a gene by a transiently expressed TF generates a unique intersection with a second TF acting on the same gene four cell divisions later; the second TF is expressed in multiple cells but only activates transcription in those where priming occurred. Early induction of active transcription is necessary and sufficient to establish a competent state, maintained by broadly expressed regulators in the absence of the initial trigger. We uncover additional cells diversified through this mechanism. Our findings define a mechanism for combinatorial TF activity with important implications for generation of cell-type diversity.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic lineage tracing unravels cell fate and plasticity in development, tissue homeostasis, and diseases. However, it remains technically challenging to trace temporary or transient cell fate, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor metastasis. Here, we generated a genetic fate-mapping system for temporally seamless tracing of transient cell fate. Highlighting its immediate application, we used it to study EMT gene activity from the local primary tumor to a distant metastatic site in vivo. In a spontaneous breast-to-lung metastasis model, we found that primary tumor cells activated vimentin and N-cadherin in situ, but only N-cadherin was activated and functionally required during metastasis. Tumor cells that have ever expressed N-cadherin constituted the majority of metastases in lungs, and functional deletion of N-cad significantly reduced metastasis. The seamless genetic recording system described here provides an alternative way for understanding transient cell fate and plasticity in biological processes.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is a core event in apoptosis signaling. However, the underlying mechanism of BAX and BAK pore formation remains incompletely understood. We demonstrate that mitochondria are globally and dynamically targeted by endolysosomes (ELs) during MOMP. In response to pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein signaling and pharmacological MOMP induction, ELs increasingly form transient contacts with mitochondria. Subsequently, ELs rapidly accumulate within the entire mitochondrial compartment. This switch-like accumulation period temporally coincides with mitochondrial BAX clustering and cytochrome c release. Remarkably, interactions of ELs with mitochondria control BAX recruitment and pore formation. Knockdown of Rab5A, Rab5C, or USP15 interferes with EL targeting of mitochondria and functionally uncouples BAX clustering from cytochrome c release, while knockdown of the Rab5 exchange factor Rabex-5 impairs both BAX clustering and cytochrome c release. Together, these data reveal that EL-mitochondrial inter-organelle communication is an integral regulatory component of functional MOMP execution during cellular apoptosis signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL6) and its downstream effector STAT3 constitute a key oncogenic pathway, which has been thought to be functionally connected to estrogen receptor α (ER) in breast cancer. We demonstrate that IL6/STAT3 signaling drives metastasis in ER+ breast cancer independent of ER. STAT3 hijacks a subset of ER enhancers to drive a distinct transcriptional program. Although these enhancers are shared by both STAT3 and ER, IL6/STAT3 activity is refractory to standard ER-targeted therapies. Instead, inhibition of STAT3 activity using the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib decreases breast cancer invasion in vivo. Therefore, IL6/STAT3 and ER oncogenic pathways are functionally decoupled, highlighting the potential of IL6/STAT3-targeted therapies in ER+ breast cancer.

Abstract: Transient receptor potential V4 (TRPV4), a plasma membrane calcium channel, is implicated as a contributor to the initiation of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Paclitaxel (PTX) is a commonly used anticancer drug that causes CIPN and lithium has been shown to prevent CIPN. However, the direct effect of PTX and lithium on TRPV4 is not clear. This study investigated these actions using biochemical, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approaches using a neuronal cell line (SH-SY5Y). The addition of pharmacologically appropriate levels of PTX increased the expression of TRPV4, TRPV4 currents, and TRPV4-dependent calcium fluxes. Prolonged exposure to PTX amplified the acute effects of TRPV4 expression, currents, and calcium fluxes. Pretreatment with lithium (1 mM) decreased TRPV4 currents and calcium fluxes in the absence and presence of PTX. These findings enhance our understanding of the properties and regulation of TRPV4, the cellular mechanisms of PTX-induced neuropathy, and the mechanism of lithium for prevention of CIPN.

Abstract: Summary
The developmental mechanisms that orchestrate differentiation of specific nephron segments are incompletely understood, and the factors that maintain their terminal differentiation after nephrogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, the transcription factor AP-2β is shown to be required for the differentiation of distal tubule precursors into early stage distal convoluted tubules (DCTs) during nephrogenesis. In contrast, its downstream target KCTD1 is essential for terminal differentiation of early stage DCTs into mature DCTs, and impairment of their terminal differentiation owing to lack of KCTD1 leads to a severe salt-losing tubulopathy. Moreover, sustained KCTD1 activity in the adult maintains mature DCTs in this terminally differentiated state and prevents renal fibrosis by repressing β-catenin activity, whereas KCTD1 deficiency leads to severe renal fibrosis. Thus, the AP-2β/KCTD1 axis links a developmental pathway in the nephron to the induction and maintenance of terminal differentiation of DCTs that actively prevents their de-differentiation in the adult and protects against renal fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
The availability of an autologous transplantable auxiliary liver would dramatically affect the treatment of liver disease. Assembly and function in vivo of a bioengineered human liver derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has not been previously described. By improving methods for liver decellularization, recellularization, and differentiation of different liver cellular lineages of human iPSCs in an organ-like environment, we generated functional engineered human mini livers and performed transplantation in a rat model. Whereas previous studies recellularized liver scaffolds largely with rodent hepatocytes, we repopulated not only the parenchyma with human iPSC-hepatocytes but also the vascular system with human iPS-endothelial cells, and the bile duct network with human iPSC-biliary epithelial cells. The regenerated human iPSC-derived mini liver containing multiple cell types was tested in vivo and remained functional for 4 days after auxiliary liver transplantation in immunocompromised, engineered (IL2rg−/−) rats.

Abstract: Summary
T cells are central to all currently effective cancer immunotherapies, but the characteristics defining therapeutically effective anti-tumor T cells have not been comprehensively elucidated. Here, we delineate four phenotypic qualities of effective anti-tumor T cells: cell expansion, differentiation, oxidative stress, and genomic stress. Using a CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screen of primary T cells we measured the multi-phenotypic impact of disrupting 25 T cell receptor-driven kinases. We identified p38 kinase as a central regulator of all four phenotypes and uncovered transcriptional and antioxidant pathways regulated by p38 in T cells. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 improved the efficacy of mouse anti-tumor T cells and enhanced the functionalities of human tumor-reactive and gene-engineered T cells, paving the way for clinically relevant interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) increases the risk for mortality and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) attenuates the progression of DKD, especially in patients with advanced kidney disease. Herein, we show that in diabetes, mTORC1 activity is increased in renal proximal tubule cells (RPTCs) along with enhanced tubule-interstitial fibrosis; this is prevented by SGLT2i. Constitutive activation of mTORC1 in RPTCs induces renal fibrosis and failure and abolishes the renal-protective effects of SGLT2i in diabetes. On the contrary, partial inhibition of mTORC1 in RPTCs prevents fibrosis and the decline in renal function. Stimulation of mTORC1 in RPTCs turns on a pro-fibrotic program in the renal cortex, whereas its inhibition in diabetes reverses the alterations in gene expression. We suggest that RPTC mTORC1 is a critical node that mediates kidney dysfunction in diabetes and the protective effects of SGLT2i by regulating fibrogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Protein synthesis inhibitors (e.g., cycloheximide) block mitotic entry, suggesting that cell cycle progression requires protein synthesis until right before mitosis. However, cycloheximide is also known to activate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which can delay mitotic entry through a G2/M checkpoint. Here, we ask whether checkpoint activation or a requirement for protein synthesis is responsible for the cycloheximide effect. We find that p38 inhibitors prevent cycloheximide-treated cells from arresting in G2 phase and that G2 duration is normal in approximately half of these cells. The Wee1 inhibitor MK-1775 and Wee1/Myt1 inhibitor PD0166285 also prevent cycloheximide from blocking mitotic entry, raising the possibility that Wee1 and/or Myt1 mediate the cycloheximide-induced G2 arrest. Thus, protein synthesis during G2 phase is not required for mitotic entry, at least when the p38 checkpoint pathway is abrogated. However, M phase progression is delayed in cycloheximide-plus-kinase-inhibitor-treated cells, emphasizing the different requirements of protein synthesis for timely entry and completion of mitosis.

Abstract: Summary
Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks) constitute a mammalian STE20-like serine/threonine kinase subfamily. Recent studies provide substantial evidence for MAP4K family kinases in the Hippo pathway regulation, suggesting a broad role of MAP4Ks in human physiology and diseases. However, a comprehensive analysis of the regulators and effectors for this key kinase family has not been fully achieved. Using a proteomic approach, we define the protein-protein interaction network for human MAP4K family kinases and reveal diverse cellular signaling events involving this important kinase family. Through it, we identify a STRIPAK complex component, STRN4, as a generic binding partner for MAP4Ks and a key regulator of the Hippo pathway in endometrial cancer development. Taken together, the results of our study not only generate a rich resource for further characterizing human MAP4K family kinases in numerous biological processes but also dissect the STRIPAK-mediated regulation of MAP4Ks in the Hippo pathway.

Abstract: Summary
DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are highly toxic DNA lesions that threaten genomic integrity. Recent findings highlight that SPRTN, a specialized DNA-dependent metalloprotease, is a central player in proteolytic cleavage of DPCs. Previous studies suggest that SPRTN deubiquitination is important for its chromatin association and activation. However, the regulation and consequences of SPRTN deubiquitination remain unclear. Here we report that, in response to DPC induction, the deubiquitinase VCPIP1/VCIP135 is phosphorylated and activated by ATM/ATR. VCPIP1, in turn, deubiquitinates SPRTN and promotes its chromatin relocalization. Deubiquitination of SPRTN is required for its subsequent acetylation, which promotes SPRTN relocation to the site of chromatin damage. Furthermore, Vcpip1 knockout mice are prone to genomic instability and premature aging. We propose a model where two sequential post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate SPRTN chromatin accessibility to repair DPCs and maintain genomic stability and a healthy lifespan.

Abstract: Summary
Brain states modulate the membrane potential dynamics of neurons, influencing the functional repertoire of the network. Pyramidal cells (PCs) in the hippocampal CA3 are necessary for rapid memory encoding, which preferentially occurs during exploratory behavior in the high-arousal theta state. However, the relationship between the membrane potential dynamics of CA3 PCs and theta has not been explored. Here we characterize the changes in the membrane potential of PCs in relation to theta using electrophysiological recordings in awake mice. During theta, most PCs behave in a stereotypical manner, consistently hyperpolarizing time-locked to the duration of theta. Additionally, PCs display lower membrane potential variance and a reduced firing rate. In contrast, during large irregular activity, PCs show heterogeneous changes in membrane potential. This suggests coordinated hyperpolarization of PCs during theta, possibly caused by increased inhibition. This could lead to a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the small population of PCs active during theta, as observed in ensemble recordings.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate regulation of innate immunity is necessary for the host to efficiently respond to invading pathogens and avoid excessive harmful immune pathology. Here we identified OTUD3 as an acetylation-dependent deubiquitinase that restricts innate antiviral immune signaling. OTUD3 deficiency in mice results in enhanced innate immunity, a diminished viral load, and morbidity. OTUD3 directly hydrolyzes lysine 63 (Lys63)-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS and thus shuts off innate antiviral immune response. Notably, the catalytic activity of OTUD3 relies on acetylation of its Lys129 residue. In response to virus infection, the acetylated Lys129 is removed by SIRT1, which promptly inactivates OTUD3 and thus allows timely induction of innate antiviral immunity. Importantly, acetyl-OTUD3 levels are inversely correlated with IFN-β expression in influenza patients. These findings establish OTUD3 as a repressor of MAVS and uncover a previously unknown regulatory mechanism by which the catalytic activity of OTUD3 is tightly controlled to ensure timely activation of antiviral defense.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrent copy-number alterations, mutations, and transcript fusions of the genes encoding CDKs/cyclins are characterized in >10,000 tumors. Genomic alterations of CDKs/cyclins are dominantly driven by copy number aberrations. In contrast to cell-cycle-related CDKs/cyclins, which are globally amplified, transcriptional CDKs/cyclins recurrently lose copy numbers across cancers. Although mutations and transcript fusions are relatively rare events, CDK12 exhibits recurrent mutations in multiple cancers. Among the transcriptional CDKs, CDK7 and CDK12 show the most significant copy number loss and mutation, respectively. Their genomic alterations are correlated with increased sensitivities to DNA-damaging drugs. Inhibition of CDK7 preferentially represses the expression of genes in the DNA-damage-repair pathways and impairs the activity of homologous recombination. Low-dose CDK7 inhibitor treatment sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibitor-induced DNA damage and cell death. Our analysis provides genomic information for identification and prioritization of drug targets for CDKs and reveals rationales for treatment strategies.

Abstract: Summary
We recently used CRISPRi/a-based chemical-genetic screens and cell biological, biochemical, and structural assays to determine that rigosertib, an anti-cancer agent in phase III clinical trials, kills cancer cells by destabilizing microtubules. Reddy and co-workers (Baker et al., 2020, this issue of Molecular Cell) suggest that a contaminating degradation product in commercial formulations of rigosertib is responsible for the microtubule-destabilizing activity. Here, we demonstrate that cells treated with pharmaceutical-grade rigosertib (>99.9% purity) or commercially obtained rigosertib have qualitatively indistinguishable phenotypes across multiple assays. The two formulations have indistinguishable chemical-genetic interactions with genes that modulate microtubule stability, both destabilize microtubules in cells and in vitro, and expression of a rationally designed tubulin mutant with a mutation in the rigosertib binding site (L240F TUBB) allows cells to proliferate in the presence of either formulation. Importantly, the specificity of the L240F TUBB mutant for microtubule-destabilizing agents has been confirmed independently. Thus, rigosertib kills cancer cells by destabilizing microtubules, in agreement with our original findings.

Abstract: Background
The osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) is impaired in multiple myeloma (MM). We investigated the effects of sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC) on osteoblast differentiation ability of BMSCs from MM.
Methods
Clinical bone marrow samples were collected. Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) was used to identify surface markers of BMSCs. BMSCs were treated with different concentrations of SCC and cell viability was detected by MTT assay. Relative mRNA and protein expressions of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), SMAD2/3, osteogenic differentiation indicators (RUNX2 and OCN) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was stained for activity detection. Formation of calcium nodus of BMSCs was examined by Alizarin Red S staining.
Results
CD90 and CD105 were high-expressed, but CD34 and CD45 were not expressed in BMSCs. BMSCs in MM group showed a lower expression of TGF-β1 and a lower degree of osteogenic differentiation. SCC enhanced activities of BMSCs, ALP activity, and formation of calcium nodus, activated TGF-β1, SMAD2/3 pathway and increased RUNX2 and OCN expressions in BMSCs. Silencing TGF-β1 reversed the effects of SCC on BMSCs in MM.
Conclusion
SCC could effectively improve the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in MM through regulating TGF-β1.

Abstract: Summary
Cells coordinate interphase-to-mitosis transition, but recurrent cytogenetic lesions appear at common fragile sites (CFSs), termed CFS expression, in a tissue-specific manner after replication stress, marking regions of instability in cancer. Despite such a distinct defect, no model fully provides a molecular explanation for CFSs. We show that CFSs are characterized by impaired chromatin folding, manifesting as disrupted mitotic structures visible with molecular fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes in the presence and absence of replication stress. Chromosome condensation assays reveal that compaction-resistant chromatin lesions persist at CFSs throughout the cell cycle and mitosis. Cytogenetic and molecular lesions are marked by faulty condensin loading at CFSs, a defect in condensin-I-mediated compaction, and are coincident with mitotic DNA synthesis (MIDAS). This model suggests that, in conditions of exogenous replication stress, aberrant condensin loading leads to molecular defects and CFS expression, concomitantly providing an environment for MIDAS, which, if not resolved, results in chromosome instability.

Abstract: Canine tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) shows a higher metastasis rate than non-tonsillar oral SCC (NTSCC). The mechanisms of metastasis for TSCC have been less studied, because both TSCC and NTSCC cell lines are few. In this study, 6 cloned TSCC (TSCCLN#1-#6), which were from a metastatic lymph node, and 2 cloned NTSCC (oSCC-1 and -4) cell lines, which were from the primary lesion, were established, and their characteristics were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that increased expression level of Vimentin in TSCC cell lines and increased expression levels of mesenchymal markers including Vimentin, Snail, and Slug in NTSCC cell lines corelated with the malignant phenotypes such as the cell growth and colony formation abilities in vitro. However, expression levels of mesenchymal markers and in vitro characteristics were unrelated to tumorigenic ability in nude mice. Additionally, the expression levels of E-cadherin and Vimentin were also evaluated by immunohistochemistry using the formalin-fixed paraffin embedded canine oral SCC tissues, and the results show that the expression level of Vimentin in TSCC was higher than in NTSCC. In conclusion, the cell lines established in this study might contribute to elucidating the mechanisms involved in TSCC metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
In response to respiratory insults, airway submucosal glands secrete copious mucus strands to increase mucociliary clearance and protect the lung. However, in cystic fibrosis, stimulating submucosal glands has the opposite effect, disrupting mucociliary transport. In cystic fibrosis (CF) pigs, loss of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channels produced submucosal gland mucus that was abnormally acidic with an increased protein concentration. To test whether these variables alter mucus, we produced a microfluidic model of submucosal glands using mucus vesicles from banana slugs. Acidic pH and increased protein concentration decreased mucus gel volume and increased mucus strand elasticity and tensile strength. However, once mucus strands were formed, changing pH or protein concentration largely failed to alter the biophysical properties. Likewise, raising pH or apical perfusion did not improve clearance of mucus strands from CF airways. These findings reveal mechanisms responsible for impaired mucociliary transport in CF and have important implications for potential treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Cell fate transitions are key to development and homeostasis. It is thus essential to understand the cellular mechanisms controlling fate transitions. Cell division has been implicated in fate decisions in many stem cell types, including neuronal and epithelial progenitors. In other stem cells, such as embryonic stem (ES) cells, the role of division remains unclear. Here, we show that exit from naive pluripotency in mouse ES cells generally occurs after a division. We further show that exit timing is strongly correlated between sister cells, which remain connected by cytoplasmic bridges long after division, and that bridge abscission progressively accelerates as cells exit naive pluripotency. Finally, interfering with abscission impairs naive pluripotency exit, and artificially inducing abscission accelerates it. Altogether, our data indicate that a switch in the division machinery leading to faster abscission regulates pluripotency exit. Our study identifies abscission as a key cellular process coupling cell division to fate transitions.

Abstract: In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence of asprosin (ASP) in the liver, kidneys, heart, stomach, testicles and brain and to determine the serum and tissue asprosin levels in diabetic rats. A total of 14 male Wistar Albino rats were divided into two groups, each containing 7 rats: (I) control group and (II) experimental diabetes group. Control rats received no treatment and the rats in the experiment group received single-dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (50 mg/kg) dissolved in 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer (pH: 4.5) intraperitoneally. Serum levels of asprosin were measured using ELISA method. The presence of asprosin in hepatic, renal, cardiac, gastric, testicular and brain tissues was investigated using immunohistochemical staining. Asprosin was detected in hepatocytes in the liver, cortical distal tubule cells in the kidney, cardiomyocytes in heart, surface epithelial cells of stomach fundus, interstitial Leydig cells in testes and cortical neurons of the brain. Compared to control group, it was found that diabetic rats had decreased asprosin levels in liver, kidney and heart tissues, increased levels in gastric and testicular tissues and no significant changes in brain tissue. Serum asprosin levels of diabetic rats were found to be decreased compared to the control group. This is the first study in the literature that reports the presence of asprosin in liver, kidney, heart, stomach, testis and brain tissues in rats. The aim of the study is to determine the presence of ASP, a newly discovered adipokine, in various tissues and to examine tissue and serum level changes in STZ-induced diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Many genes and pathways have been linked to aging, yet our understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms is still lacking. Here, we measure changes in the transcriptome, histone modifications, and DNA methylome in three metabolic tissues of adult and aged mice. Transcriptome and methylome changes dominate the liver aging footprint, whereas heart and muscle globally increase chromatin accessibility, especially in aging pathways. In mouse and human data from multiple tissues and regulatory layers, age-related transcription factor expression changes and binding site enrichment converge on putative aging modulators, including ZIC1, CXXC1, HMGA1, MECP2, SREBF1, SREBF2, ETS2, ZBTB7A, and ZNF518B. Using Mendelian randomization, we establish possible epidemiological links between expression of some of these transcription factors or their targets, including CXXC1, ZNF518B, and BBC3, and longevity. We conclude that conserved modulators are at the core of the molecular footprint of aging, and variation in tissue-specific expression of some may affect human longevity.

Abstract: Summary
Rapid alterations in cellular metabolism allow tissues to maintain homeostasis during changes in energy availability. The central metabolic regulator acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) is robustly phosphorylated during cellular energy stress by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to relieve its suppression of fat oxidation. While ACC2 can also be hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3), the physiological consequence thereof is poorly understood. We find that ACC2 phosphorylation and hydroxylation occur in an inverse fashion. ACC2 hydroxylation occurs in conditions of high energy and represses fatty acid oxidation. PHD3-null mice demonstrate loss of ACC2 hydroxylation in heart and skeletal muscle and display elevated fatty acid oxidation. Whole body or skeletal muscle-specific PHD3 loss enhances exercise capacity during an endurance exercise challenge. In sum, these data identify an unexpected link between AMPK and PHD3, and a role for PHD3 in acute exercise endurance capacity and skeletal muscle metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient release of promoter-proximally paused RNA Pol II into productive elongation is essential for gene expression. Recently, we reported that the Integrator complex can bind paused RNA Pol II and drive premature transcription termination, potently attenuating the activity of target genes. Premature termination requires RNA cleavage by the endonuclease subunit of Integrator, but the roles of other Integrator subunits in gene regulation have yet to be elucidated. Here we report that Integrator subunit 8 (IntS8) is critical for transcription repression and required for association with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). We find that Integrator-bound PP2A dephosphorylates the RNA Pol II C-terminal domain and Spt5, preventing the transition to productive elongation. Thus, blocking PP2A association with Integrator stimulates pause release and gene activity. These results reveal a second catalytic function associated with Integrator-mediated transcription termination and indicate that control of productive elongation involves active competition between transcriptional kinases and phosphatases.
