Abstract: Introduction
Prophylaxis is the treatment of choice for patients with severe hemophilia. Low adherence may limit the effectiveness of the prophylactic regimen, thereby compromising outcomes.
Objective
The objective of this study was to validate the Brazilian version of the VERITAS-Pro prophylaxis adherence scale, originally an American questionnaire that can be answered by the individual responsible for prophylaxis as well as by an observer.
Methods
The scale has 24 questions divided into six subscales: Routine, Dosage, Plan, Remember, Skip and Communicate. Participants were recruited at a blood center in southeastern Brazil for validation and reliability analyses. Validation measures included the results obtained using analog visual scales of adherence, interval between medication dispensed by the treatment center pharmacy and the percentage of recommended doses administered and infusions registered in the patients’ logs.
Results
The study included 32 individuals responsible for prophylaxis and five observers. The internal consistency was very good for the VERITAS-Pro total score, excellent for the Remember, Skip and Communicate subscales, good for the Dosage subscale, and acceptable for the Routine and Plan subscales. Twelve participants answered the questionnaire on more than one occasion to evaluate reproducibility. The intraclass correlation coefficient was excellent. Regarding convergent validity, the VERITAS-Pro scores were moderately correlated with the global adherence scale and with infusion log records, but showed a weak correlation with pharmacy dispensation records.
Conclusion
The Brazilian version of VERITAS-Pro is a valid and reliable instrument, enabling the understanding of specific factors related to non-adherence and allowing targeted interventions for proper treatment.

Abstract: Background
It is held that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) accelerates the growth rate in children with Gaucher disease, but its effect on final height has not been established with certainty. This study presents final heights of Gaucher patients followed up for 15years.
Methods
The study included 41 adults with non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease. The final height of the patients and age at puberty was compared to their mid-parental target height and to their siblings' heights.
Results
Mean final height standard deviation score (HSDS) in the patients was −0.22, but none of the patients was abnormally short (HSDS of less than −2.2). Mean age at menarche of the female patients (14.7years) was significantly delayed compared to that of their mothers (P=0.0005), and mean age at first shaving in the boys was 16years.
Conclusion
Our study showed that the mean final height of Gaucher patients fell below the mean of the 2000 CDC growth charts, but the patients were not of short stature (height less than the 3rd percentile). ERT treatment did not significantly impact the mean final HSDS. The onset of puberty, as indicated by the age at menarche, was delayed in girls with Gaucher disease.

Abstract: Background
Anemia during childhood is one of the biggest public health problems worldwide, including Brazil. Insufficient or abnormal production of hemoglobin, loss of iron and excessive destruction of red blood cells are the most common causes of anemia. Among the reasons of anemia, iron deficiency accounts for 50% of anemia cases in developing countries. Affected individuals present a wide range of clinical problems, including delayed neuropsychomotor progression, impaired cellular immunity and reduction of intellectual capacity. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anemia in children attending public schools in the metropolitan region of Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil.
Method
A retrospective study was conducted of 409 children aged 8–12 years old included in an extension project of the Universidade Federal do Paraná. The results of complete blood count and hemoglobin electrophoresis of all children were evaluated. Anemia was considered when the hemoglobin levels were <11.5g/dL.
Results
The prevalence of anemia was found to be 2.2% of the population studied, with hypochromic microcytic anemia being the most common type. Seven children had sickle cell trait and one had β-thalassemia.
Conclusion
The prevalence of anemia in this study was considered normal according the World Health Organization classification, which is different from the data found in other Brazilian regions.

Abstract: Introduction
Pre-transfusion tests, essential for the release of blood components, may be affected by drugs. Monoclonal antibodies represent a class of medications increasingly used in the clinical practice, with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (daratumumab) being a promising resource in the treatment of refractory myeloma. This monoclonal antibody recognizes CD38 in myeloma cells and interferes with pre-transfusion tests by causing panreactivity in indirect antiglobulin tests thereby clinically masking alloantibodies. Dithiothreitol is a reagent that breaks disulfide bonds and effectively destroys antigenic sites for CD38 on red blood cells. This study reports the immunohematological findings of pre-transfusion tests of patients with multiple myeloma receiving daratumumab and on solutions to prevent the interference of this monoclonal antibody.
Methods
Serum samples from five patients on anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody treatment were evaluated. Tests performed included ABO/RhD typing, indirect antiglobulin test, direct antiglobulin test and eluate test. A daily evaluation was performed to determine the shelf life of dithiothreitol-treated red blood cells when stored in Alsever's solution.
Results
No interference in the ABO/RhD typing results was noted but in all samples, a panreactivity was observed in indirect antiglobulin tests. Regarding the direct antiglobulin test, two samples presented positive results but negative eluates. In all samples, treatment of reagent red blood cells with 0.2M dithiothreitol offset interference by anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies. Dithiothreitol-treated red blood cells stored in Alsever's solution were stable for up to 15 days.
Conclusion
Treatment of reagent red blood cells with dithiothreitol can be efficient and accessible to offset the interference of the anti-CD38 drug in pre-transfusion tests. The number of costly serological workups can be reduced by having stored dithiothreitol red blood cells with this proving to be a useful reagent for investigating anti-CD38.

Abstract: Background
Due to laboratory logistic issues, our center has traditionally scheduled peripheral blood stem cell harvests based on timing from the start of mobilization. This has proved to be useful in some cases, but also resulted in many fruitless harvests due to poor mobilization. In order to improve the efficiency of collections and compare the effectiveness of peripheral blood CD34+ cells as a predictor with data from other reports, this study analyzed the implementation of this routine.
Methods
Peripheral blood and leukapheresis samples were quantified by flow cytometry and the association between these parameters was assessed.
Results
Sixty-six consecutive leukapheresis samples were collected from 34 patients after the collection of peripheral blood samples for CD34+ quantification. A moderate positive correlation was observed between peripheral blood CD34+ cell count and total CD34+ cell count/kg (r=0.596; p-value<0.001). A multivariable regression model also confirmed this association and allowed the estimation that for every increase in five CD34+ cells/μL in the peripheral blood, a mean increase of 0.38×106CD34+cells/kg could be predicted. Demographic characteristics, baseline comorbidities and mobilization regimen did not influence final CD34+ cell count in this sample.
Conclusions
As observed in other centers, quantification of peripheral blood CD34+ progenitor cells is a strong predictor of effectiveness to guide stem cell harvesting. Due to the results of this study, a modification in the peripheral blood stem cell harvesting logistics was implemented at our center in order to incorporate this routine.

Abstract: The selective autophagic removal of mitochondria called mitophagy is an essential physiological signaling for clearing damaged mitochondria and thus maintains the functional integrity of mitochondria and cells. Defective mitophagy is implicated in several diseases, placing mitophagy as a target for drug development. The identification of key regulators of mitophagy as well as chemical modulators of mitophagy requires sensitive and reliable quantitative approaches. Since mitophagy is a rapidly progressing event and sub-microscopic in nature, live cell image-based detection tools with high spatial and temporal resolution is preferred over end-stage assays. We describe two approaches for measuring mitophagy in mammalian cells using stable cells expressing EGFP-LC3 – Mito-DsRed to mark early phase of mitophagy and Mitochondria-EGFP – LAMP1-RFP stable cells for late events of mitophagy. Both the assays showed good spatial and temporal resolution in wide-field, confocal and super-resolution microscopy with high-throughput adaptable capability. A limited compound screening allowed us to identify a few new mitophagy inducers. Compared to the current mitophagy tools, mito-Keima or mito-QC, the assay described here determines the direct delivery of mitochondrial components to the lysosome in real time mode with accurate quantification if monoclonal cells expressing a homogenous level of both probes are established. Since the assay described here employs real-time imaging approach in a high-throughput mode, the platform can be used both for siRNA screening or compound screening to identify key regulators of mitophagy at decisive stages.

Abstract: The HBS1L-MYB intergenic region (chr6q23) regulates erythroid cell proliferation, maturation, and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression. An enhancer element within this locus, highlighted by a 3-bp deletion polymorphism (rs66650371), is known to interact with the promoter of the neighboring gene, MYB, to increase its expression, thereby regulating HbF production. RNA polymerase II binding and a 50-bp transcript from this enhancer region reported in ENCODE datasets suggested the presence of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). We characterized a novel 1283bp transcript (HMI-LNCRNA; chr6:135,096,362–135,097,644; hg38) that was transcribed from the enhancer region of MYB. Within erythroid cells, HMI-LNCRNA was almost exclusively present in nucleus, and was much less abundant than the mRNA for MYB. HMI-LNCRNA expression was significantly higher in erythroblasts derived from cultured adult peripheral blood CD34+ cells which expressed more HBB, compared to erythroblasts from cultured cord blood CD34+ cells which expressed much more HBG. Down-regulation of HMI-LNCRNA in HUDEP-2 cells, which expressed mostly HBB, significantly upregulated HBG expression both at the mRNA (200-fold) and protein levels, and promoted erythroid maturation. No change was found in the expression of BCL11A and other key transcription factors known to modulate HBG expression. HMI-LNCRNA plays an important role in regulating HBG expression, and its downregulation can result in a significant increase in HbF. HMI-LNCRNA might be a potential therapeutic target for HbF induction treatment in sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia.

Abstract: Background
The Brazilian elderly population is growing exponentially, making prevention and treatment of chronic diseases a priority in this age group. Anemia in older adults is underdiagnosed, undervalued and associated with high morbimortality.
Objective
To assess the prevalence of anemia in the elderly residents of a long-term care institution and to correlate this with individual patient history, the use of polypharmacy and mortality.
Method
A retrospective study was carried out of data extracted from medical records of patients treated in 2014 at the Hospital Geriátrico e de Convalescentes Dom Pedro II under the Preventive Actions Program.
Results
Data were collected from 88 female (48%) and 95 male (52%) elderly residents at a long-term care institution. Patient ages ranged from 60 to 102 years with a mean age of 76.3 years. Overall, 76 participants were diagnosed with anemia, representing 41% of the sample. Of those diagnosed, 35 were women (46%) and 41 were men (54%).
Conclusion
Anemia in the elderly is a clinical condition associated with increased morbimortality. However, the disorder remains underdiagnosed, resulting in higher risks for older adults. The present study found 76 patients with anemia among the 183 residents at the long-term care institution. The patient profile of this population with anemia is non-smokers, male, aged between 70 and 79 years, with normochromic/normocytic anemia and taking multiple medications.

(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2531137918300531)
Abstract: Background
Refractory or unexplained iron deficiency anemia accounts for about 15% of all cases. The endoscopic gastrointestinal workup sometimes fails to establish the cause of iron deficiency anemia and a considerable proportion of patients regardless of risk category fail to respond to oral iron supplementation. The aim of the present study was to assess the etiological role of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult Egyptian patients with unexplained or refractory iron deficiency anemia.
Methods
A case controlled study was composed of 104 iron deficiency anemia cases and 70 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Patients were diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia according to hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation. Upper and lower endoscopies were performed and active H. pylori infection was investigated by testing for the H. pylori antigen in stool specimens. Hematological response to H. pylori treatment with triple therapy together with iron therapy (n=32) or only iron therapy (n=32) were assessed in patients with H. pylori infection.
Results
H. pylori infection was more prevalent in patients with unexplained or refractory iron deficiency anemia (61.5%). Of the different hematological parameters investigated, there was a significant correlation only between H. pylori infection and mean corpuscular volume (p-value 0.046). Moreover, there was a significant correlation between receiving triple therapy together with iron supplementation and improvements in the hematological parameters [hemoglobin (p-value<0.001), mean corpuscular volume (p-value<0.001), iron (p-value<0.001) and serum ferritin (p-value<0.001)] compared to receiving iron supplementation alone.
Conclusions
Failing to test for H. pylori infection could lead to a failure to identify a treatable cause of anemia and could lead to additional and potentially unnecessary investigations. Furthermore, treatment of H. pylori infection together with iron supplementation gives a more rapid and satisfactory response.

Abstract: Background
Bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) implantation effectively restored rats’ erectile dysfunction (ED). Long noncoding RNA (LncRNA)-myocardial infarction-associated transcript (MIAT) has been reported to play an important role in regulating endothelial cells (ECs) function via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that induced BM-MSCs differentiation into ECs. However, the molecular functions and biological roles of lncRNA MIAT in ED remained unclear.
Methods
The rat model of ED was established. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used to detect the expression of lncRNA MIAT, von Willebrand factor (vWF), vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and VEGF following BM-MSCs transfection. Erectile function was evaluated by intra-cavernous pressure/mean artery pressure (ICP/MAP). Furthermore, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and RNA pull down as well as luciferase reporter assay were carried out to examine the interaction among lncRNA MIAT, miR-200a and VEGF.
Results
BM-MSCs restored ED by upregulating lncRNA MIAT. LncRNA MIAT was upregulated in a time-dependent manner during BM-MSCs differentiation into ECs. LncRNA MIAT regulated VEGF via targeting miR-200a, thereby promoting BM-MSCs differentiation into ECs. LncRNA MIAT knockdown in vivo abolished the effect of BM-MSCs on ED.
Conclusion
LncRNA MIAT promoted BM-MSCs differentiation into ECs and restored ED via miR-200a.

Abstract: Objectives
To determine the frequency of folic acid deficiency in consecutive serum folate determinations and to determine whether there was a significant decrease in serum folate deficiency after folate was added to wheat flour.
Methods
A retrospective descriptive observational study was performed of consecutive folate measurements at the Hospital Privado Universitario, Cordoba, Argentina.
Results
Two cohorts were analyzed: 1197 folate measurements between 2001 and 2008 (before supplementation) and 3335 folate measurements from 2009 to 2014 (after supplementation). Folate deficiency was found in 84/1197 (7%) subjects in the pre-supplementation group and in 58/3335 (1.73%) after supplementation. The prevalence of folate deficiency was 12% between 2001 and 2003 when folate was not added to flour compared to 4% in 2004–2007 (p-value<0.0001) when folate was added to the flour but no widespread use was documented.
Conclusions
In the studied population, the prevalence of serum folic acid deficiency after folate supplementation was low at 1.73%. There was a significant decrease in folate deficiency after folate was added to wheat flour. Given the low prevalence of folic acid deficiency observed in this and similar studies, and the observed change with supplementation, we conclude that routine measurement of serum folate is of limited clinical use.

Abstract: Background
Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells containing RNA remnants. Their population kinetics has been documented under various in vivo and in vitro conditions, including after storage of red blood cells in blood banks. The purpose of this study was to describe the influence of blood bank storage on the kinetics of reticulocyte disappearance by in vitro culturing.
Method
Samples of reticulocyte-enriched fractions (Percoll density-gradient) were obtained over different storage times from six red blood cell units stored in additive solution-1 (AS-1). Reticulocyte fractions were then cultured in enriched media at 37°C and analyzed by flow cytometry with thiazole orange taking into account hemolysis.
Results
Density-gradient enriched reticulocyte fractions were obtain from standard red blood cell units with <1% of reticulocytes. An exponential drop of reticulocytes was observed in cultures. The time taken for reticulocyte disappearance in cultures was shorter with increased blood bank storage time (144±46h at 0.5 weeks of storage and 15±14h in the sixth week). High fluorescence reticulocytes disappeared completely in 42.5±8.5h, medium fluorescence reticulocytes in 73.4±20.8h and low fluorescence reticulocytes in 269.9±98.8h in red blood cell units stored for half a week. These times significantly decreased in red blood cell units stored for more time.
Conclusion
In vitro reticulocyte disappearance was significantly faster after prolonged storage of red blood cell units at 4°C. The in vitro half-life at 0.5 weeks of storage was not significantly different from the values reported for fresh venous blood, but after the sixth week of storage, the half-lives were shorter. The possible explanation is that blood bank storage does not cause irreversible damage to the human reticulocyte maturational machinery.

Abstract: Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF/KLF1) is an erythroid-specific transcription factor whose activity is essential for erythropoiesis. The underlying mechanisms for EKLF specifically restricted to erythroid cells are of great interest but remain incompletely understood. To explore the epigenetic regulation of EKLF expression by promoter DNA methylation, we investigated the methylation status of the EKLF promoter and EKLF gene expression from a panel of human tissues. We observed that erythroid-specific hypomethylation of the EKLF promoter in adult erythroid cells was positively associated with EKLF expression. Demethylation of the EKLF promoter by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine led to elevated EKLF expression in non-erythroid cells. We further uncovered that EKLF promoter DNA methylation reduced the binding affinity for the transcription factors GATA1 and c-myb (MYB), which in turn silenced EKLF expression. These results suggest that hypomethylation of the EKLF promoter has functional significance in the establishment and maintenance of erythroid-specific gene expression.

Abstract: Poor adherence of transfusion-dependent patients to chelation treatment is often the cause of persistent iron overload and ensuing morbidity. However, a tool to assess patient compliance with therapy is lacking in clinical practice. Labile plasma iron (LPI, the redox-active component of non-transferrin bound iron) has been studied as an indicator of systemic iron overload and of chelation efficacy, and may particularly reflect recent iron equilibrium. We considered the use of LPI as a potential indicator for recent chelation treatment in 18 transfusion-dependent pediatric patients. Samples were collected under chelation treatment or after a short interruption of the treatment, and LPI was measured by the FeROS assay (Aferrix, Tel Aviv, Israel). LPI was significantly higher after a short-term interruption of the chelation (median of 0.4 μM off-therapy [range:0–4] vs 0 μM on-therapy [range:0–2.8] (p < .001)). Conversely, serum iron, serum ferritin and calculated transferrin saturation were not significantly higher in the “off-therapy” samples compared to “on-therapy”. In addition, in multivariate logistic regression analysis LPI was the variable most significantly associated with recent chelation treatment (p = .001). We conclude that LPI could serve as a useful indicator of compliance to chelation therapy.

Abstract: Background
Pyruvate kinase deficiency is a hereditary disease that affects the glycolytic pathway of the red blood cell, causing nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. The disease is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait and shows a marked variability in clinical expression. This study reports on the molecular characterization of ten Brazilian pyruvate kinase-deficient patients and the genotype–phenotype correlations.
Method
Sanger sequencing and in silico analysis were carried out to identify and characterize the genetic mutations. A non-affected group of Brazilian individuals were also screened for the most commonly reported variants (c.1456C>T and c.1529G>A).
Results
Ten different variants were identified in the PKLR gene, of which three are reported here for the first time: p.Leu61Gln, p.Ala137Val and p.Ala428Thr. All the three missense variants involve conserved amino acids, providing a rationale for the observed enzyme deficiency. The allelic frequency of c.1456C>T was 0.1% and the 1529G>A variant was not found.
Conclusion
This is the first comprehensive report on molecular characterization of pyruvate kinase deficiency from South America. The results allowed us to correlate the severity of the clinical phenotype with the identified variants.

Abstract: Mammalian Lst8 interacts with the kinase domain of mTOR and stabilizes its interaction with Raptor regulating cell growth through the mTOR-S6K1 signalling pathway. Fission yeast Wat1, an ortholog of mammalian Lst8 is also an essential component of TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR Complex 2 (TORC2) that control protein kinases essential for metabolic pathways. Here, we show that in response to osmotic stress, the Wat1 protein undergoes hyper-phosphorylation at S116 position. Wat1 interacts with the C-terminal region of Tor1 that also contain kinase domain. Co-immunoprecipitation and molecular modelling studies suggest that Wat1-Tor1 interaction is stabilized by FATC domain of Tor1 protein present at the C-terminal region. We have also demonstrated a physical interaction of Wat1 with Gad8, an AGC family protein kinase that is dependent on phosphorylation of Wat1 at S116 residue. Wat1 phosphorylation is required for the maintenance of vacuolar integrity and sexual differentiation. Collectively, our study reveals Wat1 phosphorylation regulates Gad8 function in a manner dependent on Tor1 interaction.

Abstract: Introduction
The estimated involvement of the central nervous system in patients with multiple myeloma is rare at about 1%. The infiltration can be identified at the time multiple myeloma is diagnosed or during its progression. However, it is more common in refractory disease or during relapse.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study reviewed data from medical records of patients followed up at the Gammopathy Outpatient Clinic of Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São Paulo from January 2008 to December 2016.
Results
Twenty patients were included, with a median follow-up of 33.5 months after central nervous system infiltration. The prevalence was 7%. The median age at diagnosis of multiple myeloma was 56.1 years, with 70% of participants being female. Sixteen patients had central nervous system infiltration at diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Seventeen patients had exclusive osteodural lesions and three had infiltrations of the leptomeninge, of which one had exclusive involvement and two had associated osteodural lesions. The median overall survival was 40.3 months after central nervous system involvement. The median overall survival in the group with central nervous system infiltration at relapse was 7.4 months. The patients with leptomeningeal involvement had a median overall survival of 5.8 months.
Conclusion
Central nervous system infiltration is a rare condition, but it should be considered as a possibility in patients with multiple myeloma and neurological symptoms. The best treatment regimen for this condition remains unknown and, in most cases, the prognosis is unfavorable.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate, in a large prospective multicenter study, whether 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose-positron emission tomography is sufficiently accurate to identify clinically important bone marrow involvement by Hodgkin's lymphoma to replace routine bone marrow biopsy in a developing tropical country.
Methods
Patients newly diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma were recruited from six cancer centers in Brazil. All were staged by the results of positron emission tomography/computed tomography that were centrally reviewed and by iliac crest bone marrow biopsy. Patients were classified as having marrow disease if they had lymphoma identified by marrow biopsy histology or had focal 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose marrow uptake that resolved following chemotherapy.
Results
A total of 246 participants were recruited from six different centers and 62 (25.2%) were judged to have Hodgkin's lymphoma in the bone marrow. Positron emission tomography and biopsies were concordant in 206 patients (83%). Positron emission tomography correctly identified marrow disease in 59/62 patients (95.1%) and marrow biopsy in 25/62 patients (40.3%). In 22/62 (35.4%) patients, the two techniques were concordant in the diagnosis of marrow involvement. Of the forty discordant results, positron emission tomography found bone marrow involvement in 37 patients, upstaging 22 to stage IV and having an impact on therapeutic decision in nine cases given their reallocation from early to advanced stage. Three false negative positron emission tomography results were obtained with bone marrow biopsy giving positive findings. All three cases were classified as stage IV regardless of bone marrow findings implying no modification in the clinical management. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of positron emission tomography for detecting bone marrow disease were 95%, 100% and 98% and for bone marrow biopsy they were 40%, 100% and 84%, respectively.
Conclusion
We conclude that positron emission tomography can replace marrow biopsy in Brazilian patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma without compromising clinical management.

Abstract: The Gaucher Outcome Survey (GOS) is an international disease-specific registry established in 2010 for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Gaucher disease (GD), regardless of GD type or treatment status. For insight into how GD management varies among countries, we analyzed treatment patterns in GOS. As of October 30, 2015, data on GD-specific treatment (enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy, or chemical chaperone therapy) received at any time were available for 647 patients. At analysis, velaglucerase alfa (316/573, 55.1%) and imiglucerase (184/573, 32.1%) were the treatments most widely used. Of the 647 treated patients, 446 (68.9%) had been treated for >5years and 368 (56.9%) had received only one GD-specific drug therapy. There were 377 patients who received velaglucerase alfa. Velaglucerase alfa was most widely used at 60U/kg every other week (134/492 dose entries, 27.2%), but there were differences in dosing between the three highest-enrolling countries (defined as >100 GOS patients enrolled in each), with most patients in Israel receiving <20U/kg, most patients in the United Kingdom receiving 20 to <40U/kg, and most in the United States receiving 60U/kg. This analysis provides a foundation upon which to examine real-life outcomes data from different treatment regimens globally.

Abstract: The ESCRT pathway functions at different subcellular membranes to induce their negative curvature, and it has been largely characterized in model eukaryotes belonging to Opisthokonta. But searches of the genomes of many nonopisthokonts belonging to various supergroups indicate that some of them may harbour fewer ESCRT components. Of the genomes explored thus far, one of the most minimal set of ESCRT components was identified in the human pathogen Giardia lamblia, which belongs to Excavata. Here we report that an ESCRT-mediated pathway most likely operates at the peripheral vesicles, which are located at the cell periphery and the bare zone of this protist. Functional comparison of all the identified putative giardial ESCRT components, with the corresponding well-characterized orthologues from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicated that only some of the ESCRT components could functionally substitute for the corresponding yeast proteins. While GlVps25, GlVps2, and all three paralogues of GlVps4, tested positive in functional complementation assays, GlVps22, GlVps20, and GlVps24 did not. Binary interactions of either GlVps22 or GlVps25, with other ESCRT-II components from Giardia or yeast indicate that the giardial Vps36 orthologue is either completely missing or highly diverged. Interactions within the giardial ESCRT-III components also differ from those in yeast; while GlVps46a interacts preferentially with Vps24 compared to Vps2, GlVps46b, like the yeast orthologue, interacts with both.

Abstract: Up to now, there are no reliable biochemical markers or imaging that could reveal early tissue damage in Gaucher disease. Therefore, we addressed whether elastography technique can serve as a tool for evaluating patients with Gaucher disease. The study included 42 patients with Gaucher disease type I and 33 patients with liver cirrhosis as well as 22 healthy volunteers. Ultrasound and Doppler examination was performed on each participant prior to apply transient and 2D shear wave elastography. In Gaucher disease the median stiffness of the spleen as assessed by transient elastography (TE) and shear wave elastography (SWE) was 35KPa and 22KPa respectively in contrast to the median stiffness of healthy controls (16.95 and 17.5KPa, p=0.0028 and p=0.0002, respectively) and of patients with cirrhosis (45KPa and 34.5KPa, p=0.015 and p<0.0001 respectively). The liver stiffness in GD as measured by TE and SWE had median values of 7.1KPa and 7KPa respectively, slightly higher than in the healthy controls, but much smaller than for the cirrhotic patients (medians of 24.2KPa and 21KPa). In conclusion, a transient and shear wave elastography show a significant promise as noninvasive and reproducible tools to differentiate Gaucher disease from healthy controls and among those with splenomegaly from cirrhotic patients.

Abstract: Identifying sickle cell disease patients at high risk of complications could lead to personalized treatment and better prognosis but despite many advances prediction of the clinical course of these patients remains elusive. We propose a system-type approach to discover profiles of multiple, common biomarkers that correlate with morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease. We used cluster analysis to discover 17 signatures of 17 common circulating biomarkers in 2320 participants of the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, and evaluated the association of these signatures with risk for stroke, pain, leg ulceration, acute chest syndrome, avascular necrosis, seizure, death, and trend of fetal hemoglobin and hemolysis using longitudinally collected data. The analysis shows that some of the signatures are associated with reduced risk for complications, while others are associated with increased risk for complications. We also show that these signatures repeat in two more contemporary studies of sickle cell disease and correlate with recently discovered biomarkers of pulmonary vascular disease. With replication and further study, these biomarker signatures could become an important and affordable precision medicine tool to aid treatment and management of the disease.

Abstract: Background
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a curative treatment for many patients with hematological disorders. Donor–recipient genetic disparity, especially involving the human leukocyte antigen system is a critical factor for transplant outcome.
Objective
To evaluate retrospectively donor characteristics and correlations with the occurrence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, disease-free survival and overall survival in a Brazilian population submitted to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between 1994 and 2012 in a single center.
Results
Three hundred and forty-seven consecutive transplantations were included. Related transplants (81.2%) were significantly more common than unrelated transplants (18.7%); donor and recipient median ages were 34 (range: 1–61) and 33 (range: 3–65) years respectively with donor HLAs being matched for 333 (95.9%) patients. Donor gender, cytomegalovirus status and ABO incompatibility did not influence the five-year overall survival. In univariate analyses, overall survival was negatively influenced by the presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (33% vs. 47%, respectively; p-value=0.04), unrelated transplant (41.5% vs. 50.9%, respectively; p-value=0.045) and donors aged over 40 years (41% vs. 52%, respectively; p-value=0.03). Older donors were associated with a higher rate of acute (52% vs. 65.8%; p-value=0.03) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (60% vs. 43%, respectively; p-value=0.015). In multivariate analyses, acute graft-versus-host disease [relative risk (RR): 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1–29; p-value=0.008] and older donors (RR: 1.6; 95% CI 1.11–2.24; p-value=0.013) were associated with higher transplant-related mortality.
Conclusions
In transplant patients, to have a donor older than 40 years of age seems to significantly increase the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease and transplant-related mortality with no impact on disease-free survival and overall survival. In spite of the rather small cohort of patients, these findings are similar to what is described in the literature suggesting that a younger donor should be chosen whenever possible.

Abstract: Developing red blood cells exhibit multiple, redundant systems for regulating and coordinating the uptake of iron, the synthesis of heme, and the formation of hemoglobin during terminal differentiation. We recently described the roles of poly rC-binding protein (PCBP1) and nuclear coactivator 4 (NCOA4) in mediating the flux of iron through ferritin in developing erythroid cells, with PCBP1, an iron chaperone, delivering iron to ferritin and NCOA4, an autophagic cargo receptor, directing ferritin to the lysosome for degradation and iron release. Ferritin iron flux is critical, as mice lacking these factors develop microcytic anemia. Here we report that these processes are regulated by cellular iron levels in a murine model of ex vivo terminal differentiation. PCBP1 delivers iron to ferritin via a direct protein-protein interaction. This interaction is developmentally regulated, enhanced by iron deprivation, and inhibited by iron excess, both in developing cells and in vitro. NCOA4 activity also exhibited developmental regulation and regulation by cellular iron levels. Excess iron uptake during differentiation triggered lysosomal degradation of NCOA4, which was dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2. Thus, developing red blood cells express a series of proteins that both mediate and regulate the flux of iron to the mitochondria.

Abstract: Gaucher disease is characterized by multi-organ infiltration of phospholipid-laden macrophages. Bone involvement is characterized by typical deformities, osteopenia/osteoporosis, pathological fractures, and bone marrow infiltration (avascular osteonecrosis, infarction). Estimation of skeletal disease includes bone quality that contributes substantially to bone strength. We studied 23 type 1 Gaucher patients (median age 22years, range 3–73) on Enzyme Replacement Therapy from 2months to 26years (median 7years); 4 patients had pathological fractures, 10 bone infarctions, 6 avascular osteonecrosis. We noninvasively assessed bone quality by trabecular microarchitecture and macroscopic geometry, using two innovative dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry tools: Trabecular Bone Score (TBS) and Hip Structural Analysis (HSA). Bone quality parameters distinguished the patients with skeletal complications. TBS was significantly lower in patients with avascular osteonecrosis (p=0.049) and pathological fractures (p=0.024), while it could not identify those with bone infarctions. Among HSA parameters, the Cross Sectional Area of the intertrochanteric region and the Buckling Ratio of the narrow neck allowed the distinction of patients with avascular osteonecrosis. BMD was low in 11 patients (50%); neither BMD nor HSA were associated with pathological fractures. The combined evaluation of bone quality and bone quantity is useful to identify GD patients with more severe skeletal involvement.

Abstract: Background
The selection of compatible human leukocyte antigen platelets has been associated with improved platelet increments. Therefore, an effective strategy would be the selection of donors who are genetically compatible according to the human leukocyte antigen system. Nonetheless, this is costly as it concerns a highly polymorphic system, which requires a large bank of genotyped donors.
Methods
This study evaluated the feasibility of virtual crossmatching using EpVix software, which simplifies the identification of compatible donors or donors with acceptable incompatibilities.
Results
Forty-three oncohematological patients were evaluated, in 96 platelet transfusion episodes with 16.3% of the patients being found to be refractory to platelet transfusions. Eight alloimmunized, multitransfused patients were selected to evaluate human leukocyte antigen compatibility against a bank of 336 platelet donors. At least partially compatible donors were found for all patients. The number of compatible donors was found to be inversely proportional to the human leukocyte antigen-panel reactive antibody score of each patient. It was noted that five patients with scores of 15% or less had at least 190 compatible donors; four fully compatible donors were found for two other patients with scores greater than 80% and only one patient (score of 93%) did not have a fully compatible donor. However, for this last patient, 40 donors were partially compatible according to the software.
Conclusion
The results showed the effectiveness of the use of the EpVix tool to identify potential platelet donors for multitransfused and/or alloimmunized patients, even with a small number of human leukocyte antigen genotyped donors available.

Insulin downregulates C3 gene expression in human HepG2 cells through activation of PPARγ,

Abstract: C3 is an acute phase protein, and thus its plasma concentration increases quickly and drastically during the onset of inflammation. Insulin plays a complex role in inflammation. Elevated level of plasma C3 was shown to correlate with heightened fasting insulin levels and insulin resistance and appears to be a risk factor for the cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. The main source of plasma C3 is liver. Nothing is known about effects of insulin on C3 gene expression and protein secretion by hepatocytes. In light of these data we asked if insulin is capable of regulating C3 production in hepatocytes. Here we show that insulin downregulates C3 gene expression in human hepatoma cells HepG2 through activation of PI3K, mTORC1, p38 and MEK1/2 signaling pathways. Transcription factors PPARα, PPARγ, HNF4α and NF-κB are important contributors to this process. Insulin activates PPARγ through PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway, which results in PPARγ binding to DR4 and DR0 cis-acting elements within the C3 promoter and subsequent displacement of HNF4α and PPARα from these sites. As a result PPARα/NF-κB complex, which exists on C3 promoter, is broken down and C3 gene expression is downregulated. The data obtained can potentially be used to explain the molecular mechanism underlying the correlation between heightened level of plasma C3 and insulin resistance in humans.

The Children's Hospital Oakland Hip Evaluation Scale is a disease-specific tool for the clinical and functional assessment of the hip in sickle cell disease.
Objectives
To translate the tool into Brazilian Portuguese and evaluate the interobserver and test–retest reliability.
Methods
Eighteen patients diagnosed with sickle cell disease and a mean age of 49±11.9 years participated in the study. The scale was applied by two evaluators who did not speak to each other regarding their understanding of the tool and who had no prior training. Interobserver and test–retest reliability of individual items and of the total score were evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient and the Bland–Altman method.
Results
When the overall score for each hip was considered, the test–retest intraclass correlation coefficient score for the right hip was 0.95 (0.89–0.98) and for the left hip it was 0.96 (0.91–0.98). Considering all assignments (total score), the score was 0.96 (0.90–0.98). The test–retest intraclass correlation coefficient varied from 0.76 to 1 for 18 of the 27 items (excellent) and from 0.53 to 0.75 for nine items (moderate). When the overall score for each hip was considered, the interobserver intraclass correlation coefficient for both hips was 0.94 (0.86–0.98). Considering all assignments, the total score was 0.94 (0.86–0.98). The interobserver intraclass correlation coefficient varied from 0.48 to 0.75 for 18 out of 27 items (moderate) and varied from 0.77 to 1 for the remaining nine items (excellent).
Conclusion
The results demonstrate that the Brazilian version of the Children's Hospital Oakland Hip Evaluation Scale presented adequate interobserver and test–retest reliability and that the version can be used to evaluate clinical function in sickle cell disease patients, producing consistent, standardized and reproducible results.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) has phenotypic variability. Increased GD awareness especially among at-risk Ashkenazi Jews (AJ) and availability of non-invasive diagnosis induced trend to prenatal screening. We retrospectively assessed pediatric (<16years) Israeli AJ GD patients to ascertain demographics and phenotype at presentation and over-time because many were identified by large-scale screening. 55/67 patients born since 01/01/2000 are AJ with non-neuronopathic GD: 28 (50.9%) are N370S/N370S; 24 (43.6%) are N370S/other; 3 (3.5%) have no N370S allele. 30 (54.5%) diagnosed by screening; 10 (18.2%) with sibling diagnosed by screening. Of 19 (34.5%) receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), 4/19 (21.1%) were by screening (N370S/N370S; N370S/L444P, N370S/84GG, N370S/IVS2+1); 15/19 (78.9%) diagnosed by symptoms and/or symptomatic sibling. 4/19 (21.1%) began ERT at age <2years; 9/19 (47.4%) at 3–5years; 6/19 (31.6%) at 6–12years. 49% presented with height/weight growth percentiles ≤25%, but group means were comparable up to 12years follow-up including 10 receiving ERT (8 for >5years). 22% presented with anemia, 20% with thrombocytopenia; at last follow-up 4% and 6%, respectively, remained cytopenic. We present a new demographic profile for pediatric GD because many identified by screening had/have few GD signs/symptoms. Nonetheless, early diagnosis is important, especially for non-N370S, non-mild genotypes.

Abstract: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a treatment for malignant and non-malignant disorders. However, sometimes the numbers of donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are limiting, which can compromise the success of HCT. We recently published that collection and processing of mouse bone marrow (BM) and human cord blood cells in a hypoxic atmosphere of 3% O2 or in ambient air (~21% O2) in the presence of cyclosporine A yields increased numbers of HSC. We now show that collection and processing of mouse BM cells in ambient air in the presence of specific combinations of anti-oxidants and/or inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes can also enhance the collection of HSC, information of potential relevance for enhanced efficacy of HCT.

Abstract: Objective
To identify barriers to the self-care practice of young people with sickle cell disease.
Method
This qualitative study was conducted with 17 individuals with sickle cell disease aged between 13 and 24 years in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil in March and April 2017. An interview investigated the barriers to self-care practice and the feelings associated with sickle cell disease. Data were transcribed and analyzed according to Bardin's perspective using the following steps: (1) pre-analysis, (2) exploration of the material, and (3) treatment of the results (inference and interpretation).
Results
Five thematic categories emerged: (1) feelings: anger, sadness, and fear; (2) bullying and stigmatization: challenges regarding walking, speaking, or behaving, as well as patient labels; (3) cognitive factors: doubts related to medication, hydration, heredity and maternity; (4) medication compliance: fear of the side effects suffered and anger triggered by the obligation to use the medication; (5) family issues: complaints of not earning the mothers’ trust to live independently.
Conclusion
The barriers to self-care in young people with sickle cell disease indicate difficulties related to emotional, behavioral, and environmental aspects. Understanding these factors will favor a better adaptation of youths to the context of sickle cell disease.

Abstract: The nuclear envelope has a stereotypic morphology consisting of a flat double layer of the inner and outer nuclear membrane, with interspersed nuclear pores. Underlying and tightly linked to the inner nuclear membrane is the nuclear lamina, a proteinous layer of intermediate filament proteins and associated proteins. Physiological, experimental or pathological alterations in the constitution of the lamina lead to changes in nuclear morphology, such as blebs and lobulations. It has so far remained unclear whether the morphological changes depend on the differentiation state and the specific lamina protein. Here we analysed the ultrastructural morphology of the nuclear envelope in intestinal stem cells and differentiated enterocytes in adult Drosophila flies, in which the proteins Lam, Kugelkern or a farnesylated variant of LamC were overexpressed. Surprisingly, we detected distinct morphological features specific for the respective protein. Lam induced envelopes with multiple layers of membrane and lamina, surrounding the whole nucleus whereas farnesylated LamC induced the formation of a thick fibrillary lamina. In contrast, Kugelkern induced single-layered and double-layered intranuclear membrane structures, which are likely be derived from infoldings of the inner nuclear membrane or of the double layer of the envelope.

Abstract: Aim
To evaluate the intraobserver and interobserver agreement for bone marrow burden (BMB) scores for individual examinations and for the change in BMB score over time in the same patient.
Methods
A total of 119 sets of MR images of the lumbar spine and femora from 60 patients with Gaucher disease were included. Each set of MR images was scored using the BMB score independently by two experienced MSK radiologists. One radiologist performed a second read four weeks later. Intraobserver and interobserver agreement was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis and weighted kappa scores.
Results
BMB scores (n=119) demonstrated fair intraobserver agreement (weighted kappa=0.53) with a mean difference of −0.20 and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) of (−3.41, 3.01). Inter observer agreement was poor with weighted kappa 0.28 with mean difference of −0.16 and 95% LOA of (−4.45, 4.11). Change in BMB scores over time (n=59) demonstrated poor/fair intraobserver agreement (weighted kappa 0.41, mean difference−0.20 and 95% LOA (−4.35, 3.94)). Interobserver agreement was poor (weighted kappa 0.25, mean difference −0.12 with wide 95% LOA (−6.23, 5.99)).
Conclusion
Significant interobserver, and to a lesser extent intraobserver, variation occurs with blinded BMB scoring of Gaucher disease.

Abstract: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an evolutionarily conserved adaptive reaction that increases cell survival under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions. ER stress–associated neuronal cell death pathways play roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has an important role in neuroprotection against neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated whether NPY has a protective role in ER stress–induced neuronal cell death in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells. An ER stress–inducing chemical, tunicamycin, increased the activities of caspase-3 and -4, whereas pretreatment with NPY decreased caspase-3 and -4 activities during the ER stress response. In addition, NPY suppressed the activation of three major ER stress sensors during the tunicamycin-induced ER stress response. NPY-mediated activation of PI3K increased nuclear translocation of XBP1s, which in turn induced expression of Grp78/BiP. Taken together, our data indicated that NPY plays a protective role in ER stress–induced neuronal cell death through activation of the PI3K–XBP1 pathway, and that NPY signaling can serve as therapeutic target for ER stress–mediated neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Orphan drug clinical trials often are adversely affected by a lack of high quality treatment efficacy data that can be reliably compared across large patient cohorts derived from multiple governmental and country jurisdictions. It is critical that these patient data be captured with limited corporate involvement. For some time, there have been calls to develop collaborative, non-proprietary, patient-centric registries for post-market surveillance of aspects related to orphan drug efficacy. There is an urgent need for the development and sustainable deployment of these ‘independent’ registries that can capture comprehensive clinical, genetic and therapeutic information on patients with rare diseases. We therefore extended an open-source registry platform, the Rare Disease Registry Framework (RDRF) to establish an Independent Rare Disease Registry (IRDR). We engaged with an established rare disease community for Gaucher disease to determine system requirements, methods of data capture, consent, and reporting. A non-proprietary IRDR model is presented that can serve as autonomous data repository, but more importantly ensures that the relevant data can be made available to appropriate stakeholders in a secure, timely and efficient manner to improve clinical decision-making and the lives of those with a rare disease.

Abstract: The human LEM-domain protein family is involved in fundamental aspects of nuclear biology. The LEM-domain interacts with the barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), which itself binds DNA. LEM-domain proteins LAP2, emerin and MAN1 are proteins of the inner nuclear membrane; they have important functions: maintaining the integrity of the nuclear lamina and regulating gene expression at the nuclear periphery. LEM4/ANKLE-2 has been proposed to participate in nuclear envelope reassembly after mitosis and to mediate dephosphorylation of BAF through binding to phosphatase PP2A. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create several cell lines deficient in LEM4/ANKLE-2. By using time-lapse video microscopy, we show that absence of this protein severely compromises the post mitotic re-association of the nuclear proteins BAF, LAP2α and LaminA to chromosomes. These defects give rise to a strong mechanical instability of the nuclear envelope in telophase and to a chromosomal instability leading to increased number of hyperploid cells. Reintroducing LEM4/ANKLE-2 in the cells by transfection could efficiently restore the telophase association of BAF and LAP2α to the chromosomes. This rescue phenotype was abolished for N- or C-terminally truncated mutants that had lost the capacity to bind PP2A. We demonstrate also that, in addition to binding to PP2A, LEM4/ANKLE-2 binds BAF through its LEM-domain, providing further evidence for a generic function of this domain as a principal interactor of BAF.

Abstract: Background
Several studies have demonstrated that platelet counts in Helicobacter pylori-positive patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura improved significantly after successful eradication of the infection. However, depending of the geographical region of the study the results have been highly divergent.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of H. pylori eradication therapy on platelet count in a cohort of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura patients from northeastern Brazil.
Method
H. pylori status was determined in 28 chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura patients using the rapid urease test and histology. H. pylori-positive patients received standard triple therapy for one week. The effect of the eradication therapy was evaluated using the 13C-urea breath test two to three months after treatment.
Results
The prevalence of H. pylori infection was similar to that found in the general population. Twenty-two patients (78.5%) were H. pylori-positive. Fifteen were treated, 13 (86%) of whom successfully. At six months, 4/13 (30%) displayed increased platelet counts, which remained throughout follow-up (12 months). Platelet response was not associated to mean baseline platelet count, duration of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, gender, age, previous use of medication, or splenectomy.
Conclusions
H. pylori eradication therapy showed relatively low platelet recovery rates, comparable with previous studies from southeastern Brazil. The effect of H. pylori eradication on platelet counts remained after one year of follow-up suggesting that treating H. pylori infection might be worthwhile in a subset of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura patients.

Abstract: Background
Peripheral blood stem cell concentrations are traditionally adjusted to 20–40×106leukocytes/mL prior to freezing. This low cell concentration at cryopreservation implies larger volumes with more dimethyl sulfoxide being used, and higher cost and toxicity at the time of transplant. Higher cell concentrations have been reported but this is not widely accepted. Moreover, the influence of cell concentration on engraftment has not been well documented. Therefore, this study retrospectively analyzed the influence of peripheral blood stem cell concentration at freezing on engraftment after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Method
Leukapheresis products were plasma-depleted and cryopreserved with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 6% hydroxyethylamide solution and 4% albumin in a −80°C freezer. Individual patient data from hospital records were reviewed.
Results
Fifty consecutive patients with oncological diseases underwent 88 leukaphereses. Median age was six years (range: 1–32 years) and median weight was 19kg (range: 8–94kg). Median leukocyte concentration was 109×106/mL at collection and 359×106 (range: 58–676×106) at freezing with 78% viability (range: 53–95%); leukocyte recovery after thawing was 95% (range: 70–100%). In multivariate analysis, cell concentration (p-value=0.001) had a negative impact on engraftment. Patients infused with bags frozen with <200×106leukocytes/mL engrafted after a median of nine days (range: 8–12 days), 200–400×106leukocytes/mL after 11 days (range: 9–20 days); 400–600×106leukocytes/mL after 12 days (range: 8–19 days) and with cell concentrations >600×106leukocytes/mL, engraftment was after 14 days (range: 13–22 days).
Conclusion
In patients with adequate CD34 cell collections, total leukocyte concentrations of 282×106/mL, freezing with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide and 6% hydroxyethylamide solution without a controlled-rate freezer, and storing cells at −80°C yielded excellent engraftment. Further increases in cell concentration may delay engraftment, without affecting safety.

Abstract: Dysfunctional organellar protein quality control machinery leads to protein misfolding associated cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, metabolic and secretory disorders. To understand organellar homeostasis, suitable tools are required which can sense changes in their respective protein folding capacity upon exposure to environmental and pharmacological perturbations. Herein, we have assessed protein folding capacity of cellular organelles using a metastable sensor selectively targeted to cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi and peroxisomes. Microscopy and biochemical data revealed that these sensors report both acute and organelle-specific cellular insults. It also provided insights into contrasting refolding capacities of cellular organelles to recover from proteotoxic challenges. Further, we used these metastable sensors to evaluate pharmacological modulation of organellar protein folding capacity by small molecules. We observed pyrazole based scaffolds increased organellar protein folding capacity through upregulation of chaperones, mainly HSP90 and its co-chaperone HOP which coordinate refolding of misfolded/aggregated species. Overall, our data highlights the potential use of organelle-specific metastable sensors to understand protein folding capacity of sub-cellular compartments and assess pharmacological correction of their proteostasis imbalance. This study also provides additional avenue for use of these organelle-specific metastable sensors in drug discovery programs for identification of novel pharmacophores and drug repositioning of promising scaffolds for protein conformational diseases associated with different cellular organelles.

Abstract: The congenital dyserythropoietic anemias are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I (CDA1) can present in utero with hydrops fetalis, but more often it presents in childhood or adulthood with moderate macrocytic anemia, jaundice, and progressive iron-overload. CDA1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with biallelic pathogenic variants in CDAN1 or C15orf41. This case report documents a severe fetal presentation of CDA1 where we identified two novel compound heterozygous mutations in CDAN1 and describes the associated pathologic findings and levels of iron-regulatory proteins hepcidin, erythroferrone, and GDF15.

Abstract: Objective
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between hematological parameters, serum iron, and vitamin B12 levels in adult hospitalized Palestinian patients infected with Helicobacter pylori.
Methods
This case–control study included 150 adult (18–50 years old) patients infected with H. pylori and 150 healthy adults. A complete blood count was performed, and serum iron and vitamin B12 levels of the patients were measured, statistically analyzed and compared with the control group. All parameters in cases were reassessed after the triple treatment of omeprazole 20mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1g b.i.d., and clarithromycin 500mg b.i.d. for 14 successive days. The triple treatment was the same for males and females.
Results
The results revealed that the mean levels of hemoglobin, red cell count, white cell count and hematocrit were significantly lower and the red blood cell distribution width significantly higher in cases compared to controls, while no significant differences were found for mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and platelet count. Serum vitamin B12 and iron levels were significantly lower in cases compared to controls (262.5±100.0 vs. 378.2±160.6pg/mL and 71.6±24.8 vs. 80.1±20.7μg/dL, respectively). Vitamin B12 and serum iron increased significantly and was restored to close to normal levels after medical treatment.
Conclusions
H. pylori infection appears to cause decreases in vitamin B12, iron levels and some hematological parameters. However, these were almost normalized after treatment with omeprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin. H. pylori is associated with vitamin B12 and iron deficiency, thus, this may be a useful marker and a possible therapeutic agent of anemic patients with gastritis.

Abstract: Sickle cell nephropathy begins with hyperfiltration and microalbuminuria and may progress to renal failure. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of losartan on glomerular function and albumin excretion in sickle cell anemia (SCA). Individuals with SCA on hydroxyurea with persistent albuminuria were enrolled in a 1-year study of losartan. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measured by iohexol clearance, albumin excretion rate (AER), and fractional clearance of dextran were assessed at baseline, short-term (1–2month), and long-term (≥12month) intervals. Twelve subjects (6 microalbuminuria, 6 macroalbuminuria) completed short-term studies; 8 completed long-term studies. Baseline GFR was 112ml/min/1.73m2 (71–147ml/min/1.73m2). AER decreased significantly at the short-term (median decrease –134 mcg/min, p=0.0063). GFR was not significantly-different at short-term or long-term intervals. Dextran clearance improved for diameters smaller than albumin (<36Å) but not larger sizes. Losartan therapy for ≥1year in sickle nephropathy results in lower albumin excretion with stable GFR. Filtration of neutral molecules ≥36Å was not changed by losartan, suggesting that the effect of losartan is a mechanism other than alteration of glomerular filtration size-selectivity.

Abstract: Bone effects are the most frequent cause of disability in Gaucher disease (GD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has improved the study of bone involvement making it possible to measure the extent of infiltration and to identify localized complications and other lesions. Here we describe the results of our analysis of all bone lesions registered in MRI studies performed in our GD Clinic. A retrospective study was undertaken for all patients with types 1 and 3 GD who underwent MRI evaluation and correlated with clinical, molecular, and other follow-up information obtained from the Spanish GD Registry. 350 MRI studies of 131 GD patients were reviewed (males 53.4%). Mean age: 37.5years (range 13-74yr), 94.6% (124) were GD1 patients. 113/131 (86.3%) of patients presented with at least one bone effect (bone infiltration, bone crisis, avascular necrosis) were 79.4%, while 28.8% showed another bone lesion such as neuronopathic-like arthropathy, hemangioma, other ischemic phenomena, infection-related lesions, secondary neoplasia and tissue infiltration. MRI is a routinely-used tool for the evaluation of GD lesions which improves the assessment of patients before and during therapy, identifies GD complications and finds other concomitant lesions. This work provides a new evaluation of MRI assessment in this complex rare disease.

Abstract: Heterozygote GBA (glucosylceramidase beta) mutations increase the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). Data based on the measured frequencies of GBA mutated alleles in the healthy population suggest that severe GBA mutations are associated with even higher risk for PD. These data, however, are prone to methodological biases resulting from the rarity of severe mutations and from ethnic-dependent differences in allele frequencies. To overcome these biases, we traced 13 Gaucher disease (GD) patients who were compound heterozygotes for one mild (N370S) and one severe GBA mutation and who reported a parent with PD. We determined the GBA mutation status of all parents and examined them whenever possible. While 50% of the parents carried a mild GBA mutation, we hypothesized that PD cases would be more likely to carry a severe mutation. We found that 10/13 PD parents had a severe mutation and only 3/10 carried a mild mutation (binomial test P<0.05). Using an unbiased methodology, we show that carriers of severe GBA mutations are at higher risk for PD relative to carriers of the mild mutations.

Abstract: Objective
Follicular and mantle cell lymphoma are low-grade B-cell malignancies that lack good responses to chemoimmunotherapy. This study aimed to assess retrospectively clinicopathological features and to determine independent prognostic factors for follicular and mantle cell lymphoma patients treated at two Brazilian medical centers: the Hematology and Hemotherapy Center of the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp), a public university hospital, and AC. Camargo Cancer Center, a specialized cancer center.
Methods
Two hundred and twenty-seven follicular and 112 mantle cell lymphoma cases were diagnosed between 1999 and 2016. Archived paraffin blocks were retrieved and reviewed. Corresponding demographics and clinical data were recovered from medical charts. Outcome analyses considered both overall and event-free survival.
Results
For follicular lymphoma treated with the R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, prednisone) and R-CVP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine sulfate, prednisone) regimens, both B-symptoms (p-value<0.01 for overall and event-free survival) and high-risk Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (p-value<0.01 for overall survival) were independently associated to worse prognosis. Maintenance with rituximab improved the prognosis (p-value<0.01 for overall survival). For mantle cell lymphoma, B-symptoms (p-value=0.03 for overall survival and event-free survival) and bone marrow infiltration (p-value=0.01 for overall survival) independently predicted reduced survival, and rituximab at induction increased both event-free and overall survival (p-value<0.01 in both analyses). Combinations of these deleterious features could identify extremely poor prognostic subgroups. The administration of rituximab was more frequent in the AC. Camargo Cancer Center, which was the institution associated with better overall survival for both neoplasias.
Conclusion
This study represents the largest cohort of follicular and mantle cell lymphoma in South America thus far. Some easily assessable clinical variables were able to predict prognosis and should be considered in low-income centers. In addition, the underuse of rituximab in the Brazilian public health system should be reconsidered in future health policies.

Abstract: Tissues and organs undergo extensive remodelling to reach their final morphology and physiological activity. The genetic programs underlying tissue formation are well studied, but less is known about how this formation is influenced by extrinsic forces derived from other concomitant morphogenetic events. Here we address this question in Drosophila melanogaster. We analyse tissue organisation in the embryonic epidermis at stage 10 by computational tissue segmentation methods to provide a quantitative description of packing. We find that the epidermis adopts different organisations along the dorso-ventral axis that correlate with differences in cell density. We analyse the contribution of three morphogenetic events that take place right before or concomitant to this period of embryogenesis, neuroblast delamination, asynchronous postblastoderm cell divisions and germ band extension, and we find that they all exert an influence on the packing of the epidermis. We previously described that the apical determinant Crumbs accumulates differentially in the epidermis along the dorso-ventral axis. Here we find that this differential accumulation of Crumbs correlates with the differential tissue packing. Perturbation of the three mentioned morphogenetic events also modulate Crumbs differential accumulation, suggesting that Crb could act as a read-out of tissue organisation. We also previously showed that Crb plays a role in regulating cell architecture. Now we find that it is also required for proper packing of the embryonic epidermis. In summary, here we uncover an intimate relationship between morphogenetic events and cell packing within a tissue that is dependent on surrounding cell density. Furthermore we find that this morphogenetically-regulated tissue packing modulates the key cell polarity protein Crumbs, which in turn is required for tissue packing, suggesting that it may participate in the molecular mechanism/s underlying the described tissue organisation.

Abstract: We evaluated retrospectively, efficacy and safety of taliglucerase alfa for Gaucher disease in a Brazilian population. Thirteen patients were included for efficacy analysis only one of them naïve to enzyme replacement therapy. All the parameters evaluated remained stable throughout treatment (mean duration 3,5years). Only three patients (out of 35) had to discontinue treatment due to a serious adverse event. In conclusion, treatment with taliglucerase alfa was found to be safe and efficient.

Abstract: Objective
To determine the mortality rate of children, adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Methods
The number of deaths, the mortality rate and the causes of deaths in patients with sickle cell anemia who were treated and followed up at our institution for 15 years were determined and compared to data available for the Brazilian population.
Results
The overall number of deaths was 281 patients with a mortality rate of 16.77%. Survival probability was significantly higher in females. The number of deaths and the mortality rate were age-specific with a significant increase in the 19- to 29-year-old age group. The remaining life expectancy of the patients with sickle cell anemia was less than that of Brazilians at large. The gap between the two was about 20 years for ages between one and five years with this gap decreasing to ten years after the age of 65 years. The most common causes of death were infection, acute chest syndrome, overt stroke, organ damage and sudden death during painful crises.
Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Brazilian study in a single institution in Rio de Janeiro; the mortality rate was 18.87% among adult patients with sickle cell anemia. The mortality rates in children and adults are higher than those reported in developed countries of the northern hemisphere.

Abstract: Background
Chikungunya virus, an arbovirus that belongs to the Alphavirus genus of the Togaviridae family, causes a febrile illness accompanied by rash and arthralgia. It is estimated that during outbreaks, the prevalence of Chikungunya virus RNA in viremic blood donations varies between 0.4 and 2.1%; therefore, this virus may be transmitted by transfusion. In Brazil, Chikungunya virus has been claimed to cause extensive outbreaks, however, the seroprevalence of anti-Chikungunya virus IgG among Brazilian blood donors is unknown.
Methods
Eight hundred and ninety-seven blood samples were collected from volunteer blood donors in two distant localities long after the Chikungunya virus first appeared in Brazil. In 2015, 442 samples were collected from the Hemotherapy Service of Macapá, Amapá in the northern Brazilian Amazon. To evaluate the dissemination course of the virus in Brazil, in 2016, 455 blood samples were collected from the southeastern region (Blood Center of Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo). All samples were tested for the presence of anti-Chikungunya virus IgG and viral RNA.
Results
One sample (0.2%) obtained from the Hemotherapy Center of Macapá tested positive for anti-Chikungunya virus IgG and no sample from the Blood Center of Ribeirão Preto was seroreactive to anti-Chikungunya virus IgG. All blood donations were Chikungunya virus RNA negative.
Conclusions
This study, performed during 2015–2016, indicates that the transfusion risk of Chikungunya virus in this period was low. However, due to the constant advance of this virus in Brazil, further studies during outbreaks are needed to evaluate the presence of Chikungunya virus RNA in blood donations and the respective transfusion-transmission risk.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by mutations in the GBA gene encoding lysosomal enzyme, β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GCase deficiency results in accumulation of its substrates in cells of macrophage lineage, affecting multiple organ systems. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human GCase is the standard of care to treat GD. In GD, it is well established that there are immune alterations, clinically presenting as lymphadenopathy, gammopathies, and predisposition to hematological cancers. We examined the effect of ERT on immune dysregulations in treatment-naïve GD patients longitudinally after the initiation of ERT. Immunophenotyping was performed in peripheral blood samples obtained before and after ERT. T and B lymphocyte subsets, NK, NKT and dendritic cells were evaluated. In all treatment naïve patients at baseline, transitional B cells, characterized by CD21low expression were markedly elevated. After establishment of stable-dose therapy, CD21low cells were significantly reduced and subsequent increase in CD21Hi B lymphocytes indicated improved B cell maturation. Class-switching and memory B cell defects which were noted prior to treatment were found to be normalized. An increase in dendritic cells also resulted after the treatment. Our data shows that GD affects across various immune cell types and ERT or its effects directly improve affected immunological parameters.

Abstract: Lipids in extracellular matrices (ECM) contribute to barrier function and stability of epithelial tissues such as the pulmonary alveoli and the skin. In insects, skin waterproofness depends on the outermost layer of the extracellular cuticle termed envelope that contains cuticulin, an unidentified water-repellent complex molecule composed of proteins, lipids and catecholamines. Based on live-imaging analyses of fruit fly larvae, we find that initially envelope units are assembled within putative vesicles harbouring the ABC transporter Snu and the extracellular protein Snsl. In a second step, the content of these vesicles is distributed to cuticular lipid-transporting nanotubes named pore canals and to the cuticle surface in dependence of Snu function. Consistently, the surface of snu and snsl mutant larvae is depleted from lipids and cuticulin. By consequence, these animals suffer uncontrolled water loss and penetration of xenobiotics. Our data allude to a two-step model of envelope i.e. barrier formation. The proposed mechanism in principle parallels the events occurring during differentiation of the lipid-based ECM by keratinocytes in the vertebrate skin suggesting establishment of analogous mechanisms of skin barrier formation in vertebrates and invertebrates.

Abstract: Background
The large diversity of red blood cell antigens favors, especially in multi-transfused patients, the occurrence of autoimmunization and alloimmunization with the risk of hemolytic transfusion reactions. Thus, this study aimed to determine the rates of alloimmunization and autoimmunization in these individuals, as well as the types of alloantibodies and their systems, clinical and epidemiological aspects and the frequency of autoimmunity in alloimmunized and non-alloimmunized patients.
Methods
In a retrospective study, 153 multi-transfused patients from 2006 to 2014 were evaluated. Sixty-eight had onco-hematological diseases, 64 had hemoglobinopathies and 21 had chronic renal failure. Descriptive analyses were carried out with the proportions being compared using the chi-square test, with the significance level set at 5%.
Results
The Rh system was the most frequently involved (53.11%) and anti-E and anti-K (Kell system) were the most prevalent alloantibodies (21.87% each). Autoantibodies were found in ten patients (6.54%) with the percentages of autoimmunization in alloimmunized and non-alloimmunized individuals being 29.16% and 2.32%, respectively (p=0.0001). There was a significant difference between autoimmunization and the number of transfusions (16.21% in 6–10 vs. 5.26% <6 vs. 2.56% >10; p=0.0203) and diseases (19.04% in chronic renal failure vs. 6.25% in hemoglobinopathies vs. 2.94% in onco-hematological diseases; p=0.0329).
Conclusion
The results show a strong correlation between alloimmunization and autoimmunization. Moreover, they reinforce the need for further studies on the clinical and epidemiological profile of multi-transfused patients in relation to alloimmunity and autoimmunity, especially the latter, for a better understanding of its etiopathogenesis and physiopathogenesis.

Abstract: Chronic systemic inflammation is a pathophysiological feature of sickle cell disease (SCD). Considering that regular exercise exerts multiple beneficial health effects including anti-inflammatory actions, we investigated whether a treadmill training program could minimize the inflammatory state in transgenic sickle cell (SS) mice. To test this hypothesis, SS mice were subjected to a treadmill training protocol of 1h/day, 5days a week for 8weeks. Exercise training increased the percent of venous oxyhemoglobin and sharply decreased the percent of carboxyhemoglobin suggesting that exercise training may limit the proportion of erythrocytes that were deoxygenated in the venous circulation. Exercise training attenuated systemic inflammation as attested by a significant drop in white blood cell (WBC) count and plasma Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio. There was reduction in interleukin-1β and endothelin-1 mRNA expression in trained sickle mice. The spleen/body mass ratio was significantly decreased in trained sickle mice and there was a strong correlation between the magnitude of congestion and the relative spleen mass in all animals (trained and untrained). We conclude that moderate intensity exercise training, without any noticeable complications, may be associated with limited baseline blood deoxygenation and inflammation in sickle cell mice, and reduce sequestration of sickle erythrocytes/congestion in the spleen.

Abstract: The anaphylatoxins produced by an unbridled complement cascade in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) can alter the leukocyte environment in tissues and peripheral blood, causing clinically significant eosinophilia. While the membrane attack complex and C5a anaphlatoxin can be suppressed with anti-C5 biologics, the production of C3a is still capable of driving a destructive hypereosinophilic syndrome in spite of anticomplement therapy. The side-effects of glucocorticoids in treating hypereosinophilic syndrome limit their therapeutic index in long-term treatment and this behooves the use of alternative strategies. While use of the anti-IL-5 antibody, mepolizumab, has been reported for treatment of primary hypereosinophilic syndromes off-label, its usage in the setting of complement-driven thrombotic microangiopathy has not been attempted. We report mepolizumab's rapid resolution of a glucocorticoid-resistant hypereosinophilic syndrome that caused multi-organ dysfunction in a patient with a complex immune diathesis. The patient's long standing TTP/aHUS disease activity, shown to have direct correlation with his eosinophil count, improved with anti-IL-5 therapy, suggesting a reciprocal enhancement between the conditions.

Abstract: Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency, a genetic disorder responsible for chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, is the second most common red blood cell glycolytic enzymopathy. We report three patients from two unrelated families of Czech and Slovak origin with macrocytic hemolytic anemia due to GPI deficiency. The first patient had 15% of residual GPI activity resulting from two new heterozygous missense mutations c.478T>C and c.1414C>T leading to substitutions p.(Ser160Pro) and p.(Arg472Cys). Two other patients (siblings) inherited the same c.1414C>T p.(Arg472Cys) mutation in a homozygous constitution and lost approximately 89% of their GPI activity. Erythroid hyperplasia with dysplastic features was observed in the bone marrow of all three patients. Low hepcidin/ferritin ratio and elevated soluble transferrin receptor detected in our GPI-deficient patients suggest disturbed balance between erythropoiesis and iron metabolism contributing to iron overload.

Abstract: Mismatch repair (MMR) system, a conserved DNA repair pathway, plays crucial role in DNA recombination and is involved in gametogenesis. The impact of alterations in MMR family of proteins (bacterial MutS and MutL homologues) on mammalian fertility is well documented. However, an insight to the role of MMR in reproduction of non-mammalian organisms is limited. Hence, in the present study, we analysed the impact of mlh1 (a MutL homologue) on meiotic crossing over/recombination and fertility in a genetically tractable model, Drosophila melanogaster. Using mlh1e00130 hypomorphic allele, we report female specific adverse reproductive outcome for reduced mlh1 in Drosophila: mlh1e00130 homozygous females had severely reduced fertility while males were fertile. Further, mlh1e00130 females contained small ovaries with large number of early stages as well as significantly reduced mature oocytes, and laid fewer eggs, indicating discrepancies in egg production and ovulation. These observations contrast the sex independent and/or male specific sterility and normal follicular development as well as ovulation reported so far for MMR family proteins in mammals. However, analogous to the role(s) of mlh1 in meiotic crossing over and DNA repair processes underlying mammalian fertility, ovarian follicles from mlh1e00130 females contained significantly increased DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and reduced synaptonemal complex foci. In addition, large proportion of fertilized eggs display discrepancies in egg activation and fail to proceed beyond stage 5 of embryogenesis. Hence, reduction of the Mlh1 protein level leads to defective oocytes that fail to complete embryogenesis after fertilization thereby reducing female fertility.

Abstract: Taliglucerase alfa is an enzyme replacement therapy approved for treatment of Gaucher disease (GD) in children and adults in several countries. This multicenter extension study assessed the efficacy and safety of taliglucerase alfa in pediatric patients with GD who were treatment-naïve (n=10) or switched from imiglucerase (n=5). Patients received taliglucerase alfa 30 or 60U/kg (treatment-naïve) or the same dose as previously treated with imiglucerase every other week. In treatment-naïve patients, taliglucerase alfa 30 and 60U/kg, respectively, reduced mean spleen volume (−18.6 multiples of normal [MN] and −26.0MN), liver volume (−0.8MN and −0.9MN), and chitotriosidase activity (−72.7% and −84.4%), and increased mean Hb concentration (+2.0g/dL and +2.3g/dL) and mean platelet count (+38,200/mm3 and +138,250/mm3) from baseline through 36 total months of treatment. In patients previously treated with imiglucerase, these disease parameters remained stable through 33 total months of treatment with taliglucerase alfa. Most adverse events were mild/moderate; treatment was well tolerated. These findings extend the taliglucerase alfa safety and efficacy profile and demonstrate long-term clinical improvement in treatment-naïve children receiving taliglucerase alfa and maintenance of disease stability in children switched to taliglucerase alfa. Treatment was well-tolerated, with no new safety signals. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01411228.

Abstract: DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) mediates de novo DNA methylation. Mutations in DNMT3A are associated with hematological malignancies, most frequently acute myeloid leukemia. DNMT3A mutations are hypothesized to establish a pre-leukemic state, rendering cells vulnerable to secondary oncogenic mutations and malignant transformation. However, the mechanisms by which DNMT3A mutations contribute to leukemogenesis are not well-defined. Here, we successfully created four DNMT3A-mutated K562 cell lines with frameshift mutations resulting in truncated DNMT3A proteins. DNMT3A-mutated cell lines exhibited significantly impaired growth and increased apoptotic activity compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Consistent with previous studies, DNMT3A-mutated cells displayed impaired differentiation capacity. RNA-seq was used to compare transcriptomes of DNMT3A-mutated and WT cells; DNMT3A ablation resulted in downregulation of genes involved in spliceosome function, causing dysfunction of RNA splicing. Unexpectedly, we observed DNMT3A-mutated cells to exhibit marked genomic instability and an impaired DNA damage response compared to WT. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNMT3A-mutated K562 cells may be used to model effects of DNMT3A mutations in human cells. Our findings implicate aberrant splicing and induction of genomic instability as potential mechanisms by which DNMT3A mutations might predispose to malignancy.

Abstract: Limited information is available on the hematological characterization of the α-thalassemia carrier in pediatric age. The objective of this report was to evaluate the red cell indices according to the α-globin genotype in a cohort of children evaluated in Sardinia. Moreover, we verified the frequency of different α-globin genotypes in this cohort. A total of 453 subjects were investigated for hematological indices and for the most common α-globin defects present in Sardinia. Of them, 352 with HbA2≤3.2%, and no iron deficiency anemia were taken into consideration to evaluate the red cell indices according to the α-globin genotype in pediatric age. A total of 11 different α-genotypes were detected, confirming the wide heterogeneity of α-thalassemia in Sardinia. Moreover, our results showed that the hematological parameters in normal children may be conditioned by the clinically occult coinheritance of mild α-thalassemia alleles as already described in the adult population while microcytosis and hypocromia in children without iron deficiency should suggest the coexistence of two α-globin defects. We concluded that recognizing the α-globin gene mutations for a particular population with their particular red cell indices may help pediatricians to perform a correct diagnosis distinguishing among physiological and pathological types of microcytosis and hypocromia.

Abstract: Chronic presence of mutant, misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) initiates ER stress and induces the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). In Gaucher disease (GD), resulting from mutations in the GBA1 gene, encoding lysosomal acid β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), a certain fraction of the mutant variants is retained in the ER and activates the UPR. We have previously shown UPR activation in GD derived fibroblasts, in fibroblasts that derived from carriers of GD mutations and in Drosophila models of carriers of GD mutations. In the present work we extended our studies to include a large collection of fibroblasts, EBV-transformed B-cells and white blood cells (WBCs) that derived from GD patients. The results showed UPR activation in all tested cells. They also indicated that transcription of the GBA1 gene is upregulated through activation of the UPR-induced CHOP transcription factor. Transcription of the MAN2B gene, encoding alpha-mannosidase and of the ACP gene, encoding acid phosphatase was also elevated presumably through CHOP activation. Our results highlight the existence of chronic stress in GD derived cells due to the presence of ER-retained mutant GCase, which leads to upregulation of GBA1 expression.

Abstract: Both patients with non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease (GD) and heterozygous GBA mutation carrier are at increased risk for Parkinson disease (PD). The risk for PD in these groups does not linearly increase with glucosylceramide (GC) accumulation or with acid β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. This observation, together with other clinical systemic observations raises the possibility that extra-cellular GC actually has beneficial, anti-inflammatory, properties. Based on this hypothesis, we suggest here that the administration of supplementary oral GC to GBA carriers at risk for PD may slow inflammatory-driven secondary neuronal death. Such a treatment may act synergistically in GBA carriers once given in combination with an agent that prevent the primary pathologic process that leads to cell death. Ambroxol hydrochloride, a pharmacological chaperone, which reduces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by accumulation of mutant misfolded GCase could serve as such an agent. The efficacy of this combined therapy, derived from clinical observations, in vivo and in vitro studies, should be evaluated in clinical trials.

Abstract: Eliglustat, an oral substrate reduction therapy, is a first-line therapy for adults with Gaucher disease type 1 and a compatible CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype. Clinicians have requested more information about frequency, timing, and duration of adverse events associated with eliglustat. Adverse event data as of January 31, 2013 for all patients who received at least one dose of eliglustat were pooled from four eliglustat clinical trials (393 patients representing 535 patient-years of exposure). The following 10 adverse events noted in the eliglustat US Prescribing Information (USPI) and EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) were evaluated with regard to frequency, drug-relatedness, severity, seriousness, duration, and timing of onset: headache, arthralgia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, flatulence, abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, back pain, and extremity pain. Of 393 patients, 334 experienced one or more adverse events. Most patients (92%) continued taking eliglustat; 3% withdrew from a trial due to an adverse event. Among the 10 adverse events evaluated, none was reported as serious and none resulted in discontinuing treatment; most were mild or moderate, reported only once, and not considered eliglustat-related. The majority of adverse events noted in the eliglustat USPI and SmPC were non-serious, occasional, non-severe, and did not lead to drug discontinuation.

Abstract: Sideroblastic anemias are heterogeneous rare hematological disorders, representing diverse phenotypes. In this study, the genetic cause of congenital, transfusion dependent anemia in four unrelated families consisting of eighteen individuals, with one affected member was investigated. Probands were suspected to rare anemias, including sideroblastic anemia. Whole exome sequencing in probands followed by segregation analysis in families was performed. Two novel frame shift mutations and one previously reported missense mutation in SLC25A38 gene was identified in these families. Mutations and their recessive mood of inheritance in each family were confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. These findings suggest that sideroblastic anemia must be considered a possible etiology in cases with unexplained hemolytic anemia. Furthermore, mutations in SLC25A38 gene could be a prevalent cause of congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA) in the Iranian population. Considering that parents of all affected individuals had consanguineous marriage and belong to sub populations, where consanguineous marriage is prevalent, it is important to perform carrier screening and genetic counseling in these families and their close relatives as prevention strategy in populations at risk.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD), one of the most prevalent lysosomal storage diseases, is associated with glucocerebroside accumulation in cells of the monocyte-macrophage system in various organs, including the liver. Evaluating and managing liver disease in patients with Gaucher disease may be challenging. While hepatic involvement is common in Gaucher disease, its severity, and clinical significance span a wide spectrum, ranging from sub-clinical involvement to liver cirrhosis with its associated complications including portal hypertension. Apart from liver involvement in Gaucher disease, patients with may also suffer from other comorbidities involving the liver. That Gaucher disease itself can mimic hepatic lesions, affect laboratory tests used to characterize liver disease, and may be associated with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, complicates the diagnostic approach even more. Better understanding of liver involvement in Gaucher disease can spare patients unnecessary invasive testing, and assist physicians in decision making when evaluating patients with Gaucher disease suspected for significant liver disease. This review describes the various clinical manifestations, laboratory and imaging abnormalities that may be encountered when following patients with Gaucher disease for liver involvement. The mechanism for liver disease are discussed, as well as the possible hepato-protective effect of glucocerebroside, and the a diagnostic and treatment approaches.

Abstract: Aplastic anemia or bone marrow failure often develops as an effect of chemotherapeutic drug application for the treatment of various pathophysiological conditions including cancer. The long-term bone marrow injury affects the basic hematopoietic population including hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). The present study aimed in unearthing the underlying mechanisms of chemotherapeutics mediated bone marrow aplasia with special focus on altered redox status and associated effects on hematopoietic microenvironment and epigenetic status of hematopoietic cells. The study involves the development of busulfan and cyclophosphamide mediated mouse model for aplastic anemia, characterization of the disease with blood and marrow analysis, cytochemical examinations of bone marrow, flowcytometric analysis of hematopoietic population and microenvironmental components, determination of ROS generation, apoptosis profiling, expressional studies of Notch-1 signaling cascade molecules, investigation of epigenetic modifications including global CpG methylation of DNA, phosphorylation of histone-3 with their effects on bone marrow kinetics and expressional analysis of the anti-oxidative molecules viz; SOD-2 and Sdf-1. Severe hematopoietic catastrophic condition was observed during aplastic anemia which involved peripheral blood pancytopenia, marrow hypocellularity and decreased hematopoietic stem/progenitor population. Generation of ROS was found to play a central role in the cellular devastation in aplastic marrow which on one hand can be correlated with the destruction of hematopoiesis supportive niche components and alteration of vital Notch-1 signaling and on other hand was found to be associated with the epigenetic chromatin modifications viz; global DNA CpG hypo-methylation, histone-3 phosphorylation promoting cellular apoptosis. Decline of anti-oxidant components viz; Sdf-1 and SOD-2 hinted towards the irreversible nature of the oxidative damage during marrow aplasia. Collectively, the findings hinted towards the mechanistic correlation among ROS generation, microenvironmental impairment and epigenetic alterations that led to hematopoietic catastrophe under aplastic stress. The findings may potentiate successful therapeutic strategy development for the dreadful condition concerned.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) may worsen during pregnancy, leading to the discussion of continuing treatment during pregnancy. We examined fetal outcomes of pregnancies reported in the Gaucher Outcome Survey, an international GD-specific registry established in 2010. A total of 453 pregnancies were reported. Most pregnancies (336/453, 74.2%) were in women who did not receive GD-specific treatment during pregnancy, while enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was received during 117/453 (25.8%) pregnancies. No pregnancies exposed to substrate reduction therapy were reported. The percentage of normal outcomes (live birth delivered at term with no congenital abnormalities) was similar in untreated and treated pregnancies (92.9% vs. 91.4%). The percentage of spontaneous abortions in untreated pregnancies was 3.6% (95% CI, 1.9%– 6.2%) compared with 6.9% (95% CI, 3.0%–13.1%) in treated pregnancies (p=0.1866). In women who received velaglucerase alfa <1month prior to conception and/or during pregnancy, 34/36 (94.4%) pregnancies had normal outcomes and 2 (5.6%) ended in spontaneous abortion. Normal outcomes were observed in the 20 pregnancies with velaglucerase alfa exposure starting <1month prior to conception and continuing through all trimesters. These observations, in addition to information in the literature, suggest that continuation of ERT during pregnancy may be appropriate for GD patients.

Abstract: The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) is a membrane antiporter that has been identified in the plasma membrane, the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope and in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In humans, three genes have been identified, encoding unique NCX proteins. Although extensively studied, the NCX’s sub-cellular localization and mechanisms regulating the activity of different subtypes are still ambiguous. Here we investigated the subcellular localization of the NCX subtype 3 (NCX3) and its impact on the cell cycle. Two phenotypes, switching from one to the other during the cell cycle, were detected. One phenotype was NCX3 in the plasma membrane during S and M phase, and the other was NCX3 in the ER membrane during resting and interphase. Glycosylation of NCX3 at the N45 site was required for targeting the protein to the plasma membrane, and the N45 site functioned as an on-off switch for the translocation of NCX3 to either the plasma membrane or the membrane of the ER. Introduction of an N-glycosylation deficient NCX3 mutant led to an arrest of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. This was accompanied by accumulation of de-glycosylated NCX3 in the cytosol (that is in the ER), where it transported calcium ions (Ca2+) from the cytosol to the ER. These results, obtained in transfected HEK293T and HeLa and confirmed endogenously in SH-SY5Y cells, suggest that cells can use a dynamic Ca2+ signaling toolkit in which the NCX3 sub-cellular localization changes in synchrony with the cell cycle.

Abstract: Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of glucocerebrosidase and accumulation of glucocerebroside. Three major sub-types have been described, type 2 is an acute neurological form that exhibits serious general symptoms and poor prognosis, compared with the other types. This case was a girl diagnosed with type 2 Gaucher disease at 12months of age who presented with poor weight gain from infancy, stridor, hypertonia, hepatosplenomegaly, trismus and an eye movement disorder. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was administered, but she had frequent myoclonus and developmental regression. She needed artificial ventilation because of respiratory failure. She died at 11years of age. An autopsy demonstrated infiltrating CD68-positive large cells containing abundant lipids in alveoli, while in the liver, kidney and bone marrow CD68-positive cells were small and round. In the bone marrow, myelodysplastic changes were present without Gaucher cells. The infiltration of Gaucher cells in alveoli was marked, suggesting that ERT was relatively ineffective in pulmonary involvement, particularly intra-alveolar. Additional treatments are necessary to improve the neurological and pulmonary prognosis of type 2Gaucher disease.

Abstract: Introduction
Mutations in the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia 1 gene are the leading cause of resistance to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Mutations have been detected throughout the extension of the kinase domain of this gene and it is important to investigate their positions because there may be a difference in clinical relevance.
Objective
To evaluate mutations in the transcripts of the BCR-ABL1 gene in Brazilian patients with chronic myeloid leukemia under tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in the Hospital de Clínicas of the Universidade Federal do Paraná.
Methods
This retrospective observational cross-sectional study analyzed mutation data of BCR-ABL1 gene transcripts. Three hundred and thirty peripheral blood samples from 193 patients were evaluated with the search for mutations being achieved by Sanger sequencing.
Results
Sixteen mutation types were identified in 48/193 (24.87%) patients with T315I (20.83%) being the most common. Furthermore, four polymorphisms (T240T, K247R, E275E and Y275Y) were identified. The highest incidence of mutations (19/53: 35.85%) occurred in the P-loop of the tyrosine kinase domain, whereas no mutation was found in the A-loop. In 43/48 (89.58%) patients only one mutation was found and more than one mutation was found in 5/48 (10.42%). The simultaneous presence of two mutations (E189G/V299L and E255K/T315I) was observed in 2/5 patients while the different mutations were seen in sequential samples of the other three patients (Y253Y/T315I, T315I/E255K and E255K/T315I).
Conclusions
This molecular characterization contributed to the identification of the resistance profile to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Brazilian patients, thus enabling the use of adequate therapeutic strategies in a timely manner.

Abstract: Background
Hematologic neoplasms are associated with mutations in hematopoietic cells and chromosomal abnormalities. During aging, about 2–3% of the elderly have chromosomal abnormalities arising from clonal mosaicism, the immune system is impaired and the bone marrow loses its ability to replace blood cells.
Objective
To describe the epidemiological and cytogenetic profile of hematological malignancies, highlighting the frequency of chromosomal alterations in these neoplasms associated with aging.
Method
A retrospective cross-sectional study with analysis of karyotype exams results was performed in the Cytogenetic Laboratory of thee Blood Center of the Faculdade de Medicina de Marilia (FAMEMA) between 1998 and 2016. Blood samples from child and adult patients with different hematological malignancies treated in the Onco-hematology Outpatient Clinics of the local blood center and hospitals, and external clinics were tested.
Results
Karyotype exam results of 746 patients with a mean age of 54.7 years (±23.1) were analyzed. The elderly had the highest frequency of hematological malignancies (50.9%), followed by adults (38.3%) and young people (10.7%); elderly women had the highest percentage (55.0%). Normal karyotypes (46,XX/46,XY) were more common (61.8%) compared to abnormal karyotypes, especially among the elderly (56.4%). Myeloproliferative neoplasms were an exception with 67.4% of abnormal karyotypes.
Conclusion
There is a higher frequency of hematological malignancies among the elderly. It is possible to conclude that failures in genomic mechanisms and hematopoiesis with aging lead to the formation of cells with the chromosomal alterations found in hematological malignancies.

Abstract: We report data from a prospective, observational study (ZAGAL) evaluating miglustat 100mg three times daily orally. in treatment-naïve patients and patients with type 1 Gaucher Disease (GD1) switched from previous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Clinical evolution, changes in organ size, blood counts, disease biomarkers, bone marrow infiltration (S-MRI), bone mineral density by broadband ultrasound densitometry (BMD), safety and tolerability annual reports were analysed. Between May 2004 and April 2016, 63 patients received miglustat therapy; 20 (32%) untreated and 43 (68%) switched. At the time of this report 39 patients (14 [36%] treatment-naïve; 25 [64%] switch) remain on miglustat. With over 12-year follow-up, hematologic counts, liver and spleen volumes remained stable. In total, 80% of patients achieved current GD1 therapeutic goals. Plasma chitotriosidase activity and CCL-18/PARC concentration showed a trend towards a slight increase. Reductions on S-MRI (p=0.042) with an increase in BMD (p<0.01) were registered. Gastrointestinal disturbances were reported in 25/63 (40%), causing miglustat suspension in 11/63 (17.5%) cases. Thirty-eight patients (60%) experienced a fine hand tremor and two a reversible peripheral neuropathy.

Abstract: Background
Cytokines are key immune mediators in physiological and disease processes, whose increased levels have been associated with the physiopathology of hematopoietic malignancies, such as myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Methods
This study examined the plasma cytokine profiles of patients with essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera and of healthy subjects, and analyzed correlations with JAK2 V617F status and clinical-hematological parameters.
Results
The proinflammatory cytokine levels were increased in myeloproliferative neoplasm patients, and the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation was associated with high IP-10 levels in primary myelofibrosis patients.
Conclusions
Essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, and polycythemia vera patients exhibited different patterns of cytokine production, as revealed by cytokine network correlations. Together, these findings suggest that augmented cytokine levels are associated with the physiopathology of myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Abstract: Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) promote tolerance in solid organ transplants and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). pDCs originate from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. Following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT), pDC reconstitution in the BM and PB gradually attain levels similar to those in healthy individuals. We have investigated the recovery of pDC following allo-HSCT as a means to predict successful marrow engraftment. We retrospectively studied immune reconstitution of pDC in the BM of 48 patients following allo-HSCT for initial diagnoses of leukemia or other malignancies. Multi-parameter flow cytometry was used to detect the CD45+CD123bright HLA-DR+ CD4low pDCs in BM aspirates at 2–14months (median 6months) post allo-HSCT. Percentages of pDCs were analyzed along with engraftment, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), event-free survival, relapse and death over a period of up to 39months (median 30) following HSCT. We report that higher levels of pDCs in the BM post-HSCT are associated with successful engraftment, less severity of aGVHD, lower relapse rate, higher event-free survival and overall survival (P value <0.05 for all). pDC levels detected at a shorter time interval 2–8months (median 5months) following HSCT also showed similar results. We conclude that pDC numbers are associated with HSCT engraftment and overall survival. Flow cytometry offers rapid quantification of pDCs as an early predictor of outcome following HSCT.

Abstract: Background
Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is characterized by abnormally shaped, adhesive RBCs that interact with white blood cells and the endothelium, leading to chronic hemolysis, vasculopathy and a prothrombotic state. About 10% of subjects with a thrombotic event in the general population will have an associated antiphospholipid (aPL) antibody. One proposed mechanism for the thrombophilic nature of aPL antibodies is the disruption of the potent anticoagulant annexin A5 or Annexin A5 resistance (A5R). We designed a pilot study assessing the presence of aPL antibodies and disruption of A5R in pediatric sickle cell subjects.
Methods
39 subjects with SCA participated in this study. A5R, DRVVT, anti-β2GP1, anti-β2GP1, anti-phosphatidylserine and anti-cardiolipin antibody assays were performed.
Results
There was a high prevalence of abnormal A5R despite a low prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed an association with silent infarcts (p=0.015), lower hemoglobin (p=0.037), older age (p=0.047) and abnormal A5R.
Conclusion
We report an association between annexin A5 resistance and presence of silent infarct, low hemoglobin, and older age in a subgroup of SCA subjects. A potential role for perturbed A5R in the pathophysiology of SCA needs to be evaluated further.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial apoptosis regulators and executioners may regulate differentiation, without being involved in cell death. However, the involved factors and their roles in differentiation and apoptosis are still not fully determined. In the present study, we compared mitochondrial pathway of cell death during early neural differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Our results demonstrated that ROS generation, cytosolic cytochrome c release, caspases activation and rise in p53 protein level occurred upon either neural or apoptosis induction in hESCs. However, unlike apoptosis, no remarkable increase in apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) level at early stages of differentiation was observed. Also the caspase-like activity of caspase-9 and caspase-3/7 were seen less than apoptosis. The results suggest that low levels of Apaf-1 as an adaptor protein might be considered as a possible regulatory barrier by which differentiating cells control cell death upon rise in ROS production and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Better understanding of mechanisms via which mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway promote neural differentiation can result in development of novel therapeutic approaches.

Melanopsin and rhodopsin mediate UVA-induced immediate pigment darkening: Unravelling the photosensitive system of the skin,

Abstract: The mammalian skin has a photosensitive system comprised by several opsins, including rhodopsin (OPN2) and melanopsin (OPN4). Recently, our group showed that UVA (4.4 kJ/m2) leads to immediate pigment darkening (IPD) in murine normal and malignant melanocytes. We show the role of OPN2 and OPN4 as UVA sensors: UVA-induced IPD was fully abolished when OPN4 was pharmacologically inhibited by AA9253 or when OPN2 and OPN4 were knocked down by siRNA in both cell lines. Our data, however, demonstrate that phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway, a classical OPN4 pathway, is not involved in UVA-induced IPD in either cell line. Nonetheless, in both cell types we have shown that: a) intracellular calcium signal is necessary for UVA-induced IPD; b) the involvement of CaMK II, whose inhibition, abolished the UVA-induced IPD; c) the role of CAMK II/NOS/sGC/cGMP pathway in the process since inhibition of either NOS or sGC abolished the UVA-induced IPD. Taken altogether, we show that OPN2 and OPN4 participate in IPD induced by UVA in murine normal and malignant melanocytes through a conserved common pathway. Interestingly, upon knockdown of OPN2 or OPN4, the UVA-driven IPD is completely lost, which suggests that both opsins are required and cooperatively signal in murine both cell lines. The participation of OPN2 and OPN4 system in UVA radiation-induced response, if proven to take place in human skin, may represent an interesting pharmacological target for the treatment of depigmentary disorders and skin-related cancer.

Abstract: Objective
To evaluate the nutritional status and caloric and protein intake during the hospitalization of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Methods
A retrospective study was performed based on clinical and nutritional data of patients undergoing autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from March 2015 to March 2017. The mean caloric and protein intake were evaluated in three different intervals (P1: from admission to the day before transplantation, P2: from the transplantation day to the day before engraftment, P3: from the engraftment day to the day of hospital discharge). Body mass index, weight loss, gastrointestinal symptoms and use of nutritional therapy were also evaluated.
Results
Thirty-five patients were included in this study (25 autologous and ten allogeneic). The majority (62.6%) were overweight at admission. The median and percentage weight loss were 3.2kg and 4.6%, respectively. A nutritional supplement was provided to 33 patients for a median of nine days. The most prevalent gastrointestinal symptoms were nausea (91.4%), vomiting (88.6%) and diarrhea (80%). The mean caloric and protein intake and adequacy of patients were 1569.0±443.3Kcal (73.6±22.1%) and 66±22.8g (61.9±20%), respectively. The allogeneic group presented lower intake and caloric and protein adequacy throughout hospitalization, in particular in P2, compared to the autologous patients.
Conclusion
The patients presented deterioration of nutritional status during hospitalization with the reduction in food intake being greater in patients submitted to allogeneic transplantation.

Abstract: Background
This study investigated the influence of two conditioning regimens on the chimerical status of 104 patients with acquired severe aplastic anemia.
Methods
Patients were monitored for at least 18 months after related bone marrow transplantation and reaching partial or complete hematologic recovery. Group I patients (n=55) received 200mg/kg cyclophosphamide alone and Group II (n=49) received 120mg/kg cyclophosphamide associated with 12mg/kg busulfan. Patients were classified in three chimerism levels according to the percentage of donor cells in the peripheral blood.
Results
Chimerism ≤50% occurred in 36.4% of Group I and none of Group II; chimerism 51–90% was found in 20.0% of Group I and 10.2% of Group II; and chimerism >90% was found in 43.6% of Group I versus 89.8% of Group II. A significant association (p-value<0.001) was found between conditioning type and chimerism levels. A higher number of infused cells was associated with higher levels of chimerism only in Group I (p-value=0.013). Multivariate analysis showed that chimerism >90% is associated with the cyclophosphamide plus busulfan conditioning (p-value<0.001) and higher number of infused cells (p-value=0.009), suggesting that these factors are predictive of graft outcome. Regarding hematological recovery, higher chimerism levels were associated with higher neutrophil (p-value=0.003) and platelet counts (p-value<0.001) in Group I only. These results show that myeloablative conditioning favors full donor chimerism and non-myeloablative conditioning predisposes to mixed chimerism or autologous recovery of hematopoiesis.
Conclusion
These data show that autologous recovery depends on the intensity of immunosuppression and that the immunosuppressive function of cyclophosphamide alone can induce this type of hematopoietic recovery.

Abstract: Competitive endogenous messenger RNA (ceRNA) affects transcription of other RNA molecules by competitively binding common microRNAs. Previous studies have shown that TP53INP1 functions as a suppressor in tumor metastasis. Our study elucidated StarD13 messenger RNA as a ceRNA in regulating migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. MicroRNA-125b was identified to induce metastasis of MCF-7 cells and bind with both StarD13 3′UTR and TP53INP1 3′UTR. Therefore, a ceRNA interaction between StarD13 and TP53INP1 mediated by competitively binding to miR-125b was indicated. Importantly, a microRNA-125b binding site at 4546–4560 nt on StarD13 was verified more vital for this ceRNA interaction. Indirectly regulation of SPARC in inducing metastasis of breast cancer cells by StarD13 via competitively binding with TP53INP1 was further confirmed. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a ceRNA regulatory network which could give a better understanding of metastatic mechanisms of breast cancer.

Abstract: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Systemic corticosteroids decrease ACS severity, but the risk of readmission for vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) has limited their use. The efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as a safer alternative is currently unknown. An observational, historic cohort study compared patients with SCD with ACS who received ICS at admission (ICS) to those who did not (non-ICS). Outcome measures included rates of transfusion, oxygen requirement, BiPAP initiation, PICU transfer, intubation, readmission, hospital cost, and length of stay. One hundred twenty patients with SCD (55 non-ICS, 65 ICS) were included. A significantly higher proportion of the non-ICS group had bilateral infiltrates, but fewer had asthma. More children in the ICS group had BiPAP initiated, however transfer to the PICU, intubation, transfusion rates, oxygen requirement, hospital cost, length of stay, and readmission rates did not differ between groups. Regression analysis did not reveal any differences in outcomes, nor were outcomes changed when patients were separated based on the presence or absence of asthma. In this observational cohort study, ICS did not demonstrate a significant reduction in ACS morbidity, though ICS use should be studied in a prospective manner.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is a common lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of acid β-glucosidase, due to mutations in the GBA gene. To explore the clinical and molecular characteristics of GD patients from Southern China, GBA gene were analyzed by nest PCR and direct Sanger-sequencing. Novel missense mutations were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells by plasmid system for functional verification. Among the 22 GD patients, 19 patients were classified as type 1 and three as type 2. Over 60% of the type 1 patient had the onset before two years of age and about 42% of them died before three years of age. Six type 1 patients with L444P homozygous genotype, presented with early onset and severe hepatosplenomegaly. Four novel mutations Y22C, F109L, L149F and c.983_990delCCCACTGG were identified. The GBA activities in vitro of novel mutants Y22C, F109L and L149F were 20.2%, 6.9% and 6.5% of the wild-type, respectively. L444P mutation accounted for 47.7% of the mutant alleles. Our results revealed that type 1 GD tends to present with a severe phenotype among southern Chinese. L444P was the most prevalent mutation and L444P homozygous genotype was associated with severe type 1 GD. Three novel missense mutations identified were pathogenic.

Abstract: GAEC1 (gene amplified in oesophageal cancer 1) is a transforming oncogene with tumorigenic potential observed in both oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer. Nonetheless, there has been a lack of study done on this gene to understand how this gene exert its oncogenic properties in cancer. This study aims to identify novel mutation sites in GAEC1. To do so, seventy-nine matched colorectal cancers were tested for GAEC1 mutation via Sanger sequencing. The mutations noted were investigated for the correlations with the clinicopathological parameters of the patients with the cancer. Additionally, GAEC1 copy number aberration (CNA), mRNA and protein expression were determined with the use of droplet digital (dd) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR and Western blot (confirmed with immunofluorescence analysis). GAEC1 mutation was noted in 8.8% (n = 7/79) of the cancer tissues including one missense mutation, four loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and two substitutions. These mutations were significantly associated with cancer perforation (p = 0.021). GAEC1 mutation is frequently associated with increased GAEC1 protein expression. Nevertheless, GAEC1 mRNA and protein are only weakly associated. Taken together, GAEC1 mutation affects GAEC1 expression and is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. This further strengthens the role of GAEC1 as an oncogene.

Abstract: Background
The structure and function of platelet factor XI (FXI) protein and the presence of F11 mRNA in platelets are controversial. Although platelets are anucleated cells they contain spliceosome components and pre-mRNAs. Three platelet proteins have been demonstrated to be spliced upon platelet activation.
Objective
To determine whether FXI is also spliced upon activation and to discern the localization of FXI in platelets.
Methods
Localization of FXI in platelets was assessed by confocal immunofluorescence staining. ELISA, chromogenic assay and western blot analyses were used to measure antigen levels, activity levels and size of FXI in platelets, respectively. Splicing patterns of F11 mRNA were assessed in three states of platelet activation: activated platelets, resting platelets and αIIbβ3-integrin activated platelets.
Results
Platelet FXI was exhibited in platelet granules. Activated platelets exhibited higher levels of mature F11 mRNA and protein and lower levels of F11 pre-mRNA compared to resting or αIIbβ3-integrin activated platelets.
Conclusions
We confirmed the presence of FXI in platelets and showed that it is localized in granules but is not restricted to the same α-granule subtype as von-Willebrand factor and p-selectin. Our study also shows that F11 is present in platelets as pre-mRNA and is spliced upon platelet activation.

Abstract: Recently, miR-22 was found to be differentially expressed in different skeletal muscle growth period, indicated that it might have function in skeletal muscle myogenesis. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-22 was the most in skeletal muscle and was gradually up-regulated during mouse myoblast cell (C2C12 myoblast cell line) differentiation. Overexpression of miR-22 repressed C2C12 myoblast proliferation and promoted myoblast differentiation into myotubes, whereas inhibition of miR-22 showed the opposite results. During myogenesis, we predicted and verified transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1), a key receptor of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, was a target gene of miR-22. Then, we found miR-22 could regulate the expression of TGFBR1 and down-regulate the Smad3 signaling pathway. Knockdown of TGFBR1 by siRNA suppressed the proliferation of C2C12 cells but induced its differentiation. Conversely, overexpression of TGFBR1 significantly promoted proliferation but inhibited differentiation of the myoblast. Additionally, when C2C12 cells were treated with different concentrations of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), the level of miR-22 in C2C12 cells was reduced. The TGFBR1 protein level was significantly elevated in C2C12 cells treated with TGF-β1. Moreover, miR-22 was able to inhibit TGF-β1-induced TGFBR1 expression in C2C12 cells. Altogether, we demonstrated that TGF-β1 inhibited miR-22 expression in C2C12 cells and miR-22 regulated C2C12 cell myogenesis by targeting TGFBR1.

Abstract: Background
Diarrhea is frequently seen in autologous stem cell transplantation. Although toxicity related to conditioning is the most common cause, infectious pathogens can play a distinctive role particularly in certain regions and environments.
Methods
The role of enteropathogens was investigated in 47 patients submitted to autologous stem cell transplantation at a Brazilian center between May 2011 and May 2013. All patients who presented with diarrhea consented to stool sample analysis to identify the etiological agents including coccidia, Strongyloides sp., Clostridium difficile and other pathogenic bacteria.
Results
Thirty-nine patients (83%) had diarrhea, among whom seven (17.5%) presented with coccidia, three (7.5%) with Candida sp., one (2.5%) with C. difficile, and one (2.5%) with Giardia lamblia. There was a tendency toward a higher incidence of diarrhea in older patients (p-value=0.09) and those who received conditioning with lomustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (p-value=0.083). Furthermore, the number of days of neutropenia was higher in patients with diarrhea (p-value=0.06).
Conclusions
The high frequency of diarrhea caused by coccidia shows the importance of investigating and correctly identifying etiological agents and highlights the possible varieties of intestinal infections in patients who undergo autologous stem cell transplantation.

Abstract: Among the lysosomal storage disorders, Gaucher disease (GD) features some of the most striking alterations in the immune system, including increased levels of cytokines and chemokines. Although studies have demonstrated the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for GD, the ideal dosage remains controversial. In this study, we report differences in levels of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a, and IFN-y) and chemokines (IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1) in patients with GD type 1 treated with different ERT dosages and treatment durations. Patients were recruited from two ERT centers in Brazil and divided into two groups according to treatment facility. Comparison between groups showed that patients in group 1 had received ERT for longer (p=0.0078) and at higher doses (p=0.0002) than those in group 2. Patients in group 1 exhibited decreased levels of IL-6 (p=0.0006), TNF-α (p<0.0001), IFN-γ (p<0.0001), IL-8 (p=0.0083), IP-10 (p<0.0001), and MCP-1 (p<0.0001) when compared to patients in group 2. Otherwise, patients in both groups were clinically similar, with no differences in hemoglobin, platelet, or leukocyte counts. Our data suggest that in GD type 1 the dosage and duration of therapy may be associated with establishment of peripheral tolerance and, consequently, decreased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Abstract: Purpose
To assess hepatic and splenic apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in children with Gaucher disease type I with diffusion-weighted MR imaging and to correlate hepatic and splenic ADC with parameters of disease severity.
Subjects and methods
Prospective study was conducted upon 25 children (11 treated and 14 untreated) with Gaucher disease and 12 age and sex matched control children. They underwent diffusion-weighted MR imaging of abdomen. Hepatic and splenic ADC and volume were calculated.
Results
There was statistically difference in hepatic and splenic apparent diffusion coefficient (P=0.001) between patients and controls. The cutoff ADC of liver and spleen used to differentiate patients from controls were 0.47 and 0.39×10−3mm2 with area and curve of 0.947 and 0.886 respectively. There was significant difference in hepatic and splenic ADC between untreated and treated patients (P=0.003 and 0.001). Hepatic ADC correlated with splenic volume (r=−0.721), hepatic volume (r=−0.555) and chitotriosidase (r=−0.413). Splenic ADC correlated with splenic volume (r=−0.652), hepatic volume (r=−0.544) and chitotriosidase (r=−0.355).
Conclusion
Hepatic and splenic ADC can detect hepatic and splenic infiltration in Gaucher disease and correlated with some parameters of disease severity.

Abstract: Bone marrow (BM) in subjects with Gaucher disease (GD) displays accumulation of Gaucher cells (GC), i.e. glucocerebroside-laden macrophages. Following the assumption that macrophage proliferation and perturbation in GD modulates local inflammation-associated phenomena including angiogenesis, BM biopsies from 11 untreated GD patients and 36 controls were investigated for morphology and angiogenesis-associated features. These included microvascular density, (MVD), vessel structure and pericyte coverage, expression of VEGF-A and angiopoietins (ANGPT1 and 2). In GD BM, cellularity was higher, and GC clustered in cohesive but poorly demarcated areas, leaving irregular islands with normal hematopoiesis. MVD was 2.6-fold higher in GD marrows than in controls (p<0.001). In GC-rich areas, MVD was 1.4-fold higher (p=0.026), and vessel architecture was abnormal compared with GC-poor areas. MVD correlated with BM cellularity, particularly in GC-rich areas. Moreover, 30±17% of GD BM vessels were pericyte-coated, significantly fewer than in controls (48±16%; p<0.001). Expression of ANGPT1 and 2 was significantly higher in GD BM vessel walls than in controls (7.2- and 13.2-fold higher), whereas VEGF expression was 20-fold lower (p<0.05 for all). Thus, human GD BM shows increased angiogenesis with defective pericyte coating and skewed VEGF/ANGPT1 and 2 balances, presumably related to local accumulation of GC.

Abstract: We conducted the first nation-wide cohort study of sickle cell disease (SCD) in Italy, a Southern European country exposed to intense recent flux migration from endemic areas for SCD. We evaluate the impact of hydroxyurea on a total of 652 pediatric and adult patients from 33 Reference Centers for SCD (mean age 24.5±15years, 51.4% males). Hydroxyurea median treatment duration was 7years (range: <1year to 29years) at a mean therapeutic dose of 18±4.7mg/kg/day. Hydroxyurea was associated with a significant increase in mean total and fetal hemoglobin and a significant decrease in mean hemoglobin S, white blood and platelet counts, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Hydroxyurea was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of acute chest syndrome (−29.3%, p<0.001), vaso-occlusive crisis (−34.1%, p<0.001), hospitalization (−53.2%, p<0.001), and bone necrosis (−6.9%, p<0.001). New silent cerebral infarction (SCI) occurred during treatment (+42.4%, p<0.001) but not stroke (+0.5%, p=0.572). These observations were generally consistent upon stratification for age, descent (Caucasian or African), genotype (βS/βS, βS/β0 or βS/β+) and duration of treatment (< or ≥10years). There were no new safety concerns observed compared to those commonly reported in the literature. Our study, conducted on a large population of patients with different descent and compound state supports the benefits of hydroxyurea therapy as a treatment option.

Abstract: Intron-22 (Inv22) and intron-1 (Inv1) inversions account for approximately one half of all severe cases of hemophilia A (SHA) worldwide. Inhibitor development against exogenous factor VIII (FVIII) represents a major complication in HA. The causative F8 mutation is considered the most decisive factor conditioning inhibitor development. We aimed to investigate prevalence of Inv22 and Inv1 mutations, and its association as risk factors for developing inhibitors to FVIII. We investigated Inv22 and Inv1 in 255 SHA Mexican patients from 193 unrelated families using the inverse shifting–polymerase chain reaction (IS–PCR). We analyzed the association between inversions and inhibitor development via logistic regression introducing as covariates the populations, the inversions, F8-haplotypes and the age of patients at enrollment. Inv22 was found in 91/193 (47.2%: 38.9% exhibited Inv22-1 and 8.3% Inv22-2), and Inv1 in 2/193 (1.0%) independent families. Absolute inhibitor prevalence (IP) for Inv22 in unrelated patients was 15% (10–19). The cohorts and age of patients were independent predictors of inhibitor risk, but not inversions or haplotypes. Inversions presence in our population was associated to a moderate risk of developing inhibitors. Inv1 was found for the first time in two Mexican families. A relevant genetic component was observed by the strong concordance among brother-pairs.
