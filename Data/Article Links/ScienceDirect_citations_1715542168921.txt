Abstract: Challenges of cell-based cancer therapy include effectively homing therapeutic cells to the disease site and producing a controlled response in recognition of the microenvironment. While stem cells have been intensively studied for treating cancer as they naturally home towards sites of injury, they have drawbacks due to their pluripotency. In this paper we have shown that a stable HEK293 cell line expressing VEGFR2 and CarQ (an engineered Ca2+-sensitive RhoA) can home towards a cell colony expressing VEGF. Upon VEGF binding to VEGFR2, a Ca2+ signal is produced that in turn activates CarQ-mediated cell blebbing. With the addition of VSVG, these homing cells can further initiate pH-dependent fusion upon reaching the cell colony. This protein system can form the basis of engineering cells for therapeutic intervention by homing and inhibiting tumour growth by pH-dependent fusion.

Abstract: Summary
T cells undergo metabolic reprogramming with major changes in cellular energy metabolism during activation. In patients with mitochondrial disease, clinical data were marked by frequent infections and immunodeficiency, prompting us to explore the consequences of oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction in T cells. Since cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a critical regulator of OXPHOS, we created a mouse model with isolated dysfunction in T cells by targeting a gene, COX10, that produces mitochondrial disease in humans. COX dysfunction resulted in increased apoptosis following activation in vitro and immunodeficiency in vivo. Select T cell effector subsets were particularly affected; this could be traced to their bioenergetic requirements. In summary, the findings presented herein emphasize the role of COX particularly in T cells as a metabolic checkpoint for cell fate decisions following T cell activation, with heterogeneous effects in T cell subsets. In addition, our studies highlight the utility of translational models that recapitulate human mitochondrial disease for understanding immunometabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to respond to available nutrients is critical for all living cells. The AMP-activated protein kinase (SNF1 in yeast) is a central regulator of metabolism that is activated when energy is depleted. We found that SNF1 activity in the nucleus is regulated by controlled relocalization of the SNF1 activator Std1 into puncta. This process is regulated by glucose through the activity of the previously uncharacterized protein kinase Vhs1 and its substrate Sip5, a protein of hitherto unknown function. Phosphorylation of Sip5 prevents its association with Std1 and triggers Std1 accretion. Reversible Std1 puncta formation occurs under non-stressful, ambient conditions, creating non-amyloid inclusion bodies at the nuclear-vacuolar junction, and it utilizes cellular chaperones similarly to the aggregation of toxic or misfolded proteins such as those associated with Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and CJD diseases. Our results reveal a controlled, non-pathological, physiological role of protein aggregation in the regulation of a major metabolic cellular pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by reduced levels of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN is part of a multiprotein complex that facilitates the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). SMN has also been found to associate with mRNA-binding proteins, but the nature of this association was unknown. Here, we have employed a combination of biochemical and advanced imaging methods to demonstrate that SMN promotes the molecular interaction between IMP1 protein and the 3′ UTR zipcode region of β-actin mRNA, leading to assembly of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes that associate with the cytoskeleton to facilitate trafficking. We have identified defects in mRNP assembly in cells and tissues from SMA disease models and patients that depend on the SMN Tudor domain and explain the observed deficiency in mRNA localization and local translation, providing insight into SMA pathogenesis as a ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-assembly disorder.

Abstract: Summary
The growth cone is an essential structure for nerve growth. Although its membrane and cytoskeleton are likely to interact coordinately during nerve growth, the mechanisms are unknown due to their close proximity. Here, we used superresolution microscopy to simultaneously observe vesicles and F-actin in growth cones. We identified a novel vesicular generation mechanism that is independent of clathrin and dependent on endophilin-3- and dynamin-1 and that occurs proximal to the leading edge simultaneously with fascin-1-dependent F-actin bundling. In contrast to conventional clathrin-dependent endocytosis, which occurs distal from the leading edge at the basal surfaces of growth cones, this mechanism was distinctly observed at the apical surface using 3D imaging and was involved in mediating axon growth. Reduced endophilin or fascin inhibited this endocytic mechanism. These results suggest that, at the leading edge, vesicles are coordinately generated and transported with actin bundling during nerve growth.

Abstract: Summary
Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) are an essential component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that shields the brain against toxins and immune cells. While BBB dysfunction exists in neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease (HD), it is not known if BMECs themselves are functionally compromised to promote BBB dysfunction. Further, the underlying mechanisms of BBB dysfunction remain elusive given limitations with mouse models and post-mortem tissue to identify primary deficits. We undertook a transcriptome and functional analysis of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BMECs (iBMEC) from HD patients or unaffected controls. We demonstrate that HD iBMECs have intrinsic abnormalities in angiogenesis and barrier properties, as well as in signaling pathways governing these processes. Thus, our findings provide an iPSC-derived BBB model for a neurodegenerative disease and demonstrate autonomous neurovascular deficits that may underlie HD pathology with implications for therapeutics and drug delivery.

Abstract: Summary
Plant multisubunit RNA polymerase V (Pol V) transcription recruits Argonaute-small interfering RNA (siRNA) complexes that specify sites of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) for gene silencing. Pol V’s largest subunit, NRPE1, evolved from the largest subunit of Pol II but has a distinctive C-terminal domain (CTD). We show that the Pol V CTD is dispensable for catalytic activity in vitro yet essential in vivo. One CTD subdomain (DeCL) is required for Pol V function at virtually all loci. Other CTD subdomains have locus-specific effects. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, the 3′→ 5′ exoribonuclease RRP6L1 was identified as an interactor with the DeCL and glutamine-serine (QS)-rich subdomains located downstream of an Argonaute-binding subdomain. Experimental evidence indicates that RRP6L1 trims the 3′ ends of Pol V transcripts sliced by Argonaute 4 (AGO4), suggesting a model whereby the CTD enables the spatial and temporal coordination of AGO4 and RRP6L1 RNA processing activities.

Abstract: Summary
Plasma metabolite concentrations reflect the activity of tissue metabolic pathways and their quantitative determination may be informative about pathogenic conditions. We searched for plasma lipid species whose concentrations correlate with various parameters of glucose homeostasis and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Shotgun lipidomic analysis of the plasma of mice from different genetic backgrounds, which develop a pre-diabetic state at different rates when metabolically stressed, led to the identification of a group of sphingolipids correlated with glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. Quantitative analysis of these and closely related lipids in the plasma of individuals from two population-based prospective cohorts revealed that specific long-chain fatty-acid-containing dihydroceramides were significantly elevated in the plasma of individuals who will progress to diabetes up to 9 years before disease onset. These lipids may serve as early biomarkers of, and help identify, metabolic deregulation in the pathogenesis of T2D.

Abstract: Summary
Neuromodulatory cells transduce environmental information into long-lasting behavioral responses. However, the mechanisms governing how neuronal cells influence behavioral plasticity are difficult to characterize. Here, we adapted the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) approach in C. elegans to profile ribosome-associated mRNAs from three major tissues and the neuromodulatory dopaminergic and serotonergic cells. We identified elc-2, an Elongin C ortholog, specifically expressed in stress-sensing amphid neuron dual ciliated sensory ending (ADF) serotonergic sensory neurons, and we found that it plays a role in mediating a long-lasting change in serotonin-dependent feeding behavior induced by heat stress. We demonstrate that ELC-2 and the von Hippel-Lindau protein VHL-1, components of an Elongin-Cullin-SOCS box (ECS) E3 ubiquitin ligase, modulate this behavior after experiencing stress. Also, heat stress induces a transient redistribution of ELC-2, becoming more nuclearly enriched. Together, our results demonstrate dynamic regulation of an E3 ligase and a role for an ECS complex in neuromodulation and control of lasting behavioral states.

Abstract: Summary
Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is an oxidative stress-responsive kinase that is regulated by various interacting molecules and post-translational modifications. However, how these molecules and modifications cooperatively regulate ASK1 activity remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that tripartite motif 48 (TRIM48) orchestrates the regulation of oxidative stress-induced ASK1 activation. A pull-down screen identified a TRIM48-interacting partner, protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which negatively regulates ASK1 activation by enhancing its interaction with thioredoxin (Trx), another ASK1-negative regulator. TRIM48 facilitates ASK1 activation by promoting K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of PRMT1. TRIM48 knockdown suppressed oxidative stress-induced ASK1 activation and cell death, whereas forced expression promoted cancer cell death in mouse xenograft model. These results indicate that TRIM48 facilitates oxidative stress-induced ASK1 activation and cell death through ubiquitination-dependent degradation of PRMT1. This study provides a cell death mechanism fine-tuned by the crosstalk between enzymes that engage various types of post-translational modifications.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin regulation is a principal mechanism governing animal development, yet it is unclear to what extent structural changes in chromatin underlie tissue regeneration. Non-mammalian vertebrates such as zebrafish activate cardiomyocyte (CM) division after tissue damage to regenerate lost heart muscle. Here, we generated transgenic zebrafish expressing a biotinylatable H3.3 histone variant in CMs and derived cell-type-specific profiles of histone replacement. We identified an emerging program of putative enhancers that revise H3.3 occupancy during regeneration, overlaid upon a genome-wide reduction of H3.3 from promoters. In transgenic reporter lines, H3.3-enriched elements directed gene expression in subpopulations of CMs. Other elements increased H3.3 enrichment and displayed enhancer activity in settings of injury- and/or Neuregulin1-elicited CM proliferation. Dozens of consensus sequence motifs containing predicted transcription factor binding sites were enriched in genomic regions with regeneration-responsive H3.3 occupancy. Thus, cell-type-specific regulatory programs of tissue regeneration can be revealed by genome-wide H3.3 profiling.

Abstract: Summary
Ca2+ dynamics and oxidative signaling are fundamental mechanisms for mitochondrial bioenergetics and cell function. The MCU complex is the major pathway by which these signals are integrated in mitochondria. Whether and how these coactive elements interact with MCU have not been established. As an approach toward understanding the regulation of MCU channel by oxidative milieu, we adapted inflammatory and hypoxia models. We identified the conserved cysteine 97 (Cys-97) to be the only reactive thiol in human MCU that undergoes S-glutathionylation. Furthermore, biochemical, structural, and superresolution imaging analysis revealed that MCU oxidation promotes MCU higher order oligomer formation. Both oxidation and mutation of MCU Cys-97 exhibited persistent MCU channel activity with higher [Ca2+]m uptake rate, elevated mROS, and enhanced [Ca2+]m overload-induced cell death. In contrast, these effects were largely independent of MCU interaction with its regulators. These findings reveal a distinct functional role for Cys-97 in ROS sensing and regulation of MCU activity.

Abstract: Summary
Low inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability causes terminal differentiation of the root apical meristem (RAM), a phenomenon known as root meristem exhaustion or determined growth. Here, we report that the CLE14 peptide acts as a key player in this process. Low Pi stress induces iron mobilization in the RAM through the action of LPR1/LPR2, causing expression of CLE14 in the proximal meristem region. CLV2 and PEPR2 receptors perceive CLE14 and trigger RAM differentiation, with concomitant downregulation of SHR/SCR and PIN/AUXIN pathway. Our results reveal multiple steps of the molecular mechanism of one of the most physiologically important root nutrient responses.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1)/Smad4 signaling plays a pivotal role in maintenance of the dynamic balance between bone formation and resorption. The microRNA miR-155 has been reported to exert a significant role in the differentiation of macrophage and dendritic cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether miR-155 regulates osteoclast differentiation through TGFβ1/Smad4 signaling. Here, we present that TGFβ1 elevated miR-155 levels during osteoclast differentiation through the stimulation of M-CSF and RANKL. Additionally, we found that silencing Smad4 attenuated the upregulation of miR-155 induced by TGFβ1. The results of luciferase reporter experiments and ChIP assays demonstrated that TGFβ1 promoted the binding of Smad4 to the miR-155 promoter at a site located in 454 bp from the transcription start site in vivo, further verifying that miR-155 is a transcriptional target of the TGFβ1/Smad4 pathway. Subsequently, TRAP staining and qRT-PCR analysis revealed that silencing Smad4 impaired the TGFβ1-mediated inhibition on osteoclast differentiation. Finally, we found that miR-155 may target SOCS1 and MITF to suppress osteoclast differentiation. Taken together, we provide the first evidence that TGFβ1/Smad4 signaling affects osteoclast differentiation by regulation of miR-155 expression and the use of miR-155 as a potential therapeutic target for osteoclast-related diseases shows great promise.

Abstract: Summary
Building an integrated view of cellular responses to environmental cues remains a fundamental challenge due to the complexity of intracellular networks in mammalian cells. Here, we introduce an integrative biochemical and genetic framework to dissect signal transduction events using multiple data types and, in particular, to unify signaling and transcriptional networks. Using the Toll-like receptor (TLR) system as a model cellular response, we generate multifaceted datasets on physical, enzymatic, and functional interactions and integrate these data to reveal biochemical paths that connect TLR4 signaling to transcription. We define the roles of proximal TLR4 kinases, identify and functionally test two dozen candidate regulators, and demonstrate a role for Ap1ar (encoding the Gadkin protein) and its binding partner, Picalm, potentially linking vesicle transport with pro-inflammatory responses. Our study thus demonstrates how deciphering dynamic cellular responses by integrating datasets on various regulatory layers defines key components and higher-order logic underlying signaling-to-transcription pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a tyrosine kinase collagen adhesion receptor that mediates cell migration through association with non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA). Because DDR1 is implicated in cancer fibrosis, we hypothesized that DDR1 interacts with NMIIA to enable collagen compaction by traction forces. Mechanical splinting of rat dermal wounds increased DDR1 expression and collagen alignment. In periodontal ligament of DDR1 knockout mice, collagen mechanical reorganization was reduced >30%. Similarly, cultured cells with DDR1 knockdown or expressing kinase-deficient DDR1d showed 50% reduction of aligned collagen. Tractional remodeling of collagen was dependent on DDR1 clustering, activation, and interaction of the DDR1 C-terminal kinase domain with NMIIA filaments. Collagen remodeling by traction forces, DDR1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and myosin light chain phosphorylation were increased on stiff versus soft substrates. Thus, DDR1 clustering, activation, and interaction with NMIIA filaments enhance the collagen tractional remodeling that is important for collagen compaction in fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Investigation of cell-cycle kinetics in mammalian pancreatic β cells has mostly focused on transition from the quiescent (G0) to G1 phase. Here, we report that centromere protein A (CENP-A), which is required for chromosome segregation during the M-phase, is necessary for adaptive β cell proliferation. Receptor-mediated insulin signaling promotes DNA-binding activity of FoxM1 to regulate expression of CENP-A and polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1) by modulating cyclin-dependent kinase-1/2. CENP-A deposition at the centromere is augmented by PLK1 to promote mitosis, while knocking down CENP-A limits β cell proliferation and survival. CENP-A deficiency in β cells leads to impaired adaptive proliferation in response to pregnancy, acute and chronic insulin resistance, and aging in mice. Insulin-stimulated CENP-A/PLK1 protein expression is blunted in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes. These data implicate the insulin-FoxM1/PLK1/CENP-A pathway-regulated mitotic cell-cycle progression as an essential component in the β cell adaptation to delay and/or prevent progression to diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of ER Ca2+ homeostasis triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and drives ER-PM contact sites formation in order to refill ER-luminal Ca2+. Recent studies suggest that the ER stress sensor and mediator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) PERK regulates intracellular Ca2+ fluxes, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here, using proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), we identified the actin-binding protein Filamin A (FLNA) as a key PERK interactor. Cells lacking PERK accumulate F-actin at the cell edges and display reduced ER-PM contacts. Following ER-Ca2+ store depletion, the PERK-FLNA interaction drives the expansion of ER-PM juxtapositions by regulating F-actin-assisted relocation of the ER-associated tethering proteins Stromal Interaction Molecule 1 (STIM1) and Extended Synaptotagmin-1 (E-Syt1) to the PM. Cytosolic Ca2+ elevation elicits rapid and UPR-independent PERK dimerization, which enforces PERK-FLNA-mediated ER-PM juxtapositions. Collectively, our data unravel an unprecedented role of PERK in the regulation of ER-PM appositions through the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages play critical roles in the initiation of tumor cell motility. To capture the cellular interactions of the tumor microenvironment with high-resolution imaging, we directly visualized tumor cells and their interactions with macrophages in zebrafish. Live imaging in zebrafish revealed that macrophages are dynamic, yet maintain sustained contact with tumor cells. In addition, the recruitment of macrophages to tumor cells promotes tumor cell dissemination. Using a Cre/LoxP strategy, we found that macrophages transfer cytoplasm to tumor cells in zebrafish and mouse models. Remarkably, macrophage cytoplasmic transfer correlated with melanoma cell dissemination. We further found that macrophages transfer cytoplasm to tumor cells upon cell contact in vitro. Thus, we present a model in which macrophage/tumor cell contact allows for the transfer of cytoplasmic molecules from macrophages to tumor cells corresponding to increased tumor cell motility and dissemination.

Abstract: Summary
The G protein-coupled receptor Smoothened (Smo) is the signal transducer of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway. Smo signals through G protein-dependent and -independent routes, with G protein-independent canonical signaling to Gli effectors requiring Smo accumulation in the primary cilium. The mechanisms controlling Smo activation and trafficking are not yet clear but likely entail small-molecule binding to pockets in its extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and/or transmembrane bundle. Here, we demonstrate that the cytosolic phospholipase cPLA2α is activated through Gβγ downstream of Smo to release arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid binds Smo and synergizes with CRD-binding agonists, promoting Smo ciliary trafficking and high-level signaling. Chemical or genetic cPLA2α inhibition dampens Smo signaling to Gli, revealing an unexpected contribution of G protein-dependent signaling to canonical pathway activity. Arachidonic acid displaces the Smo transmembrane domain inhibitor cyclopamine to rescue CRD agonist-induced signaling, suggesting that arachidonic acid may target the transmembrane bundle to allosterically enhance signaling by CRD agonist-bound Smo.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity represents chronic inflammatory states promoted by pro-inflammatory M1-macrophage infiltration into white adipose tissue (WAT), thereby inducing insulin resistance. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of an ER stress protein, CHOP, in determining adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) polarity and systemic insulin sensitivity. A high-fat diet (HFD) enhances ER stress with CHOP upregulation in adipocytes. CHOP deficiency prevents HFD-induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance with ATM M2 predomination and Th2 cytokine upregulation in WAT. Whereas ER stress suppresses Th2 cytokine expression in cultured adipocytes, CHOP knockdown inhibits this downregulation. In contrast, macrophage responsiveness to Th1/Th2 cytokines is unchanged regardless of whether CHOP is expressed. Furthermore, bone marrow transplantation experiments showed recipient CHOP to be the major determinant of ATM polarity. Thus, CHOP in adipocytes plays important roles in ATM M1 polarization by altering WAT micro-environmental conditions, including Th2 cytokine downregulation. This molecular mechanism may link adipose ER stress with systemic insulin resistance.

Abstract: Phospholipase C-zeta (PLCZ1), a strong candidate of egg-activating sperm factor, can induce Ca2+ oscillations and cause egg activation. For the application of PLCZ1 to clinical use, we examined the pattern of Ca2+ responses and developmental rate by comparing PLCZ1 RNA injection methods with the other current methods, such as cytosolic aspiration, electrical stimulation and ionomycin treatment in human oocytes. We found that the pattern of Ca2+ oscillations after PLCZ1 RNA injection exhibited similar characteristics to that after ICSI treatment. We also determined the optimal concentration of human PLCZ1 RNA to activate the human oocytes. Our findings suggest that human PLCZ1 RNA is a better therapeutic agent to rescue human oocytes from failed activation, leading to normal and efficient development.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is a major human health crisis that promotes insulin resistance and, ultimately, type 2 diabetes. The molecular mechanisms that mediate this response occur across many highly complex biological regulatory levels that are incompletely understood. Here, we present a comprehensive molecular systems biology study of hepatic responses to high-fat feeding in mice. We interrogated diet-induced epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic alterations using high-throughput omic methods and used a network modeling approach to integrate these diverse molecular signals. Our model indicated that disruption of hepatic architecture and enhanced hepatocyte apoptosis are among the numerous biological processes that contribute to early liver dysfunction and low-grade inflammation during the development of diet-induced metabolic syndrome. We validated these model findings with additional experiments on mouse liver sections. In total, we present an integrative systems biology study of diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance that uncovered molecular features promoting the development and maintenance of metabolic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Intimate communication between neural and vascular cells is critical for normal brain development and function. Germinal matrix (GM), a key primordium for the brain reward circuitry, is unique among brain regions for its distinct pace of angiogenesis and selective vulnerability to hemorrhage during development. A major neonatal condition, GM hemorrhage can lead to cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, and mental retardation. Here we identify a brain-region-specific neural progenitor-based signaling pathway dedicated to regulating GM vessel development. This pathway consists of cell-surface sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors, an intracellular cascade including Gα co-factor Ric8a and p38 MAPK, and target gene integrin β8, which in turn regulates vascular TGF-β signaling. These findings provide insights into region-specific specialization of neurovascular communication, with special implications for deciphering potent early-life endocrine, as well as potential gut microbiota impacts on brain reward circuitry. They also identify tissue-specific molecular targets for GM hemorrhage intervention.

Abstract: Summary
How the developmental potential of differentiating stem cell progeny becomes rapidly and stably restricted following asymmetric stem cell division is unclear. In the fly larval brain, earmuff (erm) uniquely functions to restrict the developmental potential of intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) generated by asymmetrically dividing neural stem cells (neuroblasts). Here we demonstrate that the histone deacetylase Hdac1/Rpd3 functions together with self-renewal transcriptional repressors to maintain the erm immature INP enhancer in an inactive but poised state in neuroblasts. Within 2 hr of immature INP birth, downregulation of repressor activities alleviates Rpd3-mediated repression on the erm enhancer, enabling acetylation of multiple histone proteins and activating Erm expression. Erm restricts the developmental potential in immature INPs by repressing genes encoding neuroblast transcriptional activators. We propose that poising the fast-activating enhancers of master regulators of differentiation through continual histone deacetylation in stem cells enables self-renewal and rapid restriction of developmental potential following asymmetric division.

The Replication Protein Cdc6 Suppresses Centrosome Over-Duplication in a Manner Independent of Its ATPase Activity,

Abstract: The Cdc6 protein is essential for the initiation of chromosomal replication and functions as a licensing factor to maintain chromosome integrity. During the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, Cdc6 has been found to inhibit the recruitment of pericentriolar material (PCM) proteins to the centrosome and to suppress centrosome over-duplication. In this report, we analyzed the correlation between these two functions of Cdc6 at the centrosome. Cdc6 depletion increased the population of cells showing centrosome over-duplication and premature centrosome separation; Cdc6 expression reversed these changes. Deletion and fusion experiments revealed that the 18 amino acid residues (197–214) of Cdc6, which were fused to the Cdc6-centrosomal localization signal, suppressed centrosome over-duplication and premature centrosome separation. Cdc6 mutant proteins that showed defective ATP binding or hydrolysis did not exhibit a significant difference in suppressing centrosome over-duplication, compared to the wild type protein. In contrast to the Cdc6-mediated inhibition of PCM protein recruitment to the centrosome, the independence of Cdc6 on its ATPase activity for suppressing centrosome over-duplication, along with the difference between the Cdc6 protein regions participating in the two functions, suggested that Cdc6 controls centrosome duplication in a manner independent of its recruitment of PCM proteins to the centrosome.

Abstract: Summary
ATG4B stimulates autophagy by promoting autophagosome formation through reversible modification of ATG8. We identify ATG4B as a substrate of mammalian sterile20-like kinase (STK) 26/MST4. MST4 phosphorylates ATG4B at serine residue 383, which stimulates ATG4B activity and increases autophagic flux. Inhibition of MST4 or ATG4B activities using genetic approaches or an inhibitor of ATG4B suppresses autophagy and the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Furthermore, radiation induces MST4 expression, ATG4B phosphorylation, and autophagy. Inhibiting ATG4B in combination with radiotherapy in treating mice with intracranial GBM xenograft markedly slows tumor growth and provides a significant survival benefit. Our work describes an MST4-ATG4B signaling axis that influences GBM autophagy and malignancy, and whose therapeutic targeting enhances the anti-tumor effects of radiotherapy.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the distinctive roles of the monocytes and macrophages on osteogenic differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ADMSCs) in 3D spheroid co-cultures. We hypothesized that monocytes or macrophages (subtypes pro-inflammatory M1 and pro-wound healing M2) would affect the osteogenic differentiation of ADMSCs in 3D spheroids and that cell–cell interactions between monocytes/macrophages and ADMSCs play an important role in the osteogenic differentiation process of ADMSCs. The obtained results indicated that the osteogenic differentiation of ADMSCs was inhibited by monocytes and both macrophage subtypes in 3D spheroids. Monocytes and M2 macrophages had a stronger inhibiting effect than M1 macrophages. Cell-cell interactions mediated by N-cadherin likely played a role in the inhibiting effect of monocytes/macrophages on the osteogenic differentiation of ADMSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Rewiring of synaptic circuitry pertinent to memory formation has been associated with morphological changes in dendritic spines and with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Here, we mechanistically link these processes by uncovering a signaling pathway involving the serotonin 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), the hyaluronan receptor CD44, and the small GTPase Cdc42. We highlight a physical interaction between 5-HT7R and CD44 (identified as an MMP-9 substrate in neurons) and find that 5-HT7R stimulation increases local MMP-9 activity, triggering dendritic spine remodeling, synaptic pruning, and impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP). The underlying molecular machinery involves 5-HT7R-mediated activation of MMP-9, which leads to CD44 cleavage followed by Cdc42 activation. One important physiological consequence of this interaction includes an increase in neuronal outgrowth and elongation of dendritic spines, which might have a positive effect on complex neuronal processes (e.g., reversal learning and neuronal regeneration).

Abstract: Summary
Motile cells navigate through complex tissue environments that include both attractive and repulsive cues. In response to tissue wounding, neutrophils, primary cells of the innate immune response, exhibit bidirectional migration that is orchestrated by chemokines and their receptors. Although progress has been made in identifying signals that mediate the recruitment phase, the mechanisms that regulate neutrophil reverse migration remain largely unknown. Here, we visualize bidirectional neutrophil migration to sterile wounds in zebrafish larvae and identify specific roles for the chemokine receptors Cxcr1 and Cxcr2 in neutrophil recruitment to sterile injury and infection. Notably, we also identify Cxcl8a/Cxcr2 as a specific ligand-receptor pair that orchestrates neutrophil chemokinesis in interstitial tissues during neutrophil reverse migration and resolution of inflammation. Taken together, our findings identify distinct receptors that mediate bidirectional leukocyte motility during interstitial migration depending on the context and type of tissue damage in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Effective development of host cells for therapeutic protein production is hampered by the poor characterization of cellular transfection. Here, we employed a multi-omics-based systems biotechnology approach to elucidate the genotypic and phenotypic differences between a wild-type and recombinant antibody-producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. At the genomic level, we observed extensive rearrangements in specific targeted loci linked to transgene integration sites. Transcriptional re-wiring of DNA damage repair and cellular metabolism in the antibody producer, via changes in gene copy numbers, was also detected. Subsequent integration of transcriptomic data with a genome-scale metabolic model showed a substantial increase in energy metabolism in the antibody producer. Metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics analyses revealed an elevation in long-chain lipid species, potentially associated with protein transport and secretion requirements, and a surprising stability of N-glycosylation profiles between both cell lines. Overall, the proposed knowledge-based systems biotechnology framework can further accelerate mammalian cell-line engineering in a targeted manner.

Abstract: Summary
The proteasome holoenzyme is activated by its regulatory particle (RP) consisting of two subcomplexes, the lid and the base. A key event in base assembly is the formation of a heterohexameric ring of AAA-ATPases, which is guided by at least four RP assembly chaperones in mammals: PAAF1, p28/gankyrin, p27/PSMD9, and S5b. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we analyzed the non-AAA structure of the p28-bound human RP at 4.5 Å resolution and determined seven distinct conformations of the Rpn1-p28-AAA subcomplex within the p28-bound RP at subnanometer resolutions. Remarkably, the p28-bound AAA ring does not form a channel in the free RP and spontaneously samples multiple “open” and “closed” topologies at the Rpt2-Rpt6 and Rpt3-Rpt4 interfaces. Our analysis suggests that p28 assists the proteolytic core particle to select a specific conformation of the ATPase ring for RP engagement and is released in a shoehorn-like fashion in the last step of the chaperone-mediated proteasome assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue stores energy in the form of triglycerides. The ability to regulate triglyceride synthesis and breakdown based on nutrient status (e.g., fed versus fasted) is critical for physiological homeostasis and dysregulation of this process can contribute to metabolic disease. Whereas much is known about hormonal control of this cycle, transcriptional regulation is not well understood. Here, we show that the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) is critical for the control of adipocyte lipid turnover. Mice lacking Klf15 in adipose tissue (AK15KO) display decreased adiposity and are protected from diet-induced obesity. Mechanistic studies suggest that adipose KLF15 regulates key genes of triglyceride synthesis and inhibits lipolytic action, thereby promoting lipid storage in an insulin-dependent manner. Finally, AK15KO mice demonstrate accelerated lipolysis and altered systemic energetics (e.g., locomotion, ketogenesis) during fasting conditions. Our study identifies adipose KLF15 as an essential regulator of adipocyte lipid metabolism and systemic energy balance.

Abstract: Summary
In individuals, heterogeneous drug-response phenotypes result from a complex interplay of dose, drug specificity, genetic background, and environmental factors, thus challenging our understanding of the underlying processes and optimal use of drugs in the clinical setting. Here, we use mass-spectrometry-based quantification of molecular response phenotypes and logic modeling to explain drug-response differences in a panel of cell lines. We apply this approach to cellular cholesterol regulation, a biological process with high clinical relevance. From the quantified molecular phenotypes elicited by various targeted pharmacologic or genetic treatments, we generated cell-line-specific models that quantified the processes beneath the idiotypic intracellular drug responses. The models revealed that, in addition to drug uptake and metabolism, further cellular processes displayed significant pharmacodynamic response variability between the cell lines, resulting in cell-line-specific drug-response phenotypes. This study demonstrates the importance of integrating different types of quantitative systems-level molecular measurements with modeling to understand the effect of pharmacological perturbations on complex biological processes.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphorylation plays an essential role in microRNA (miRNA) processing by regulating co-factors of the miRNA biogenesis machinery. HYL1 (Hyponastic Leaves 1), a core co-factor in plant miRNA biogenesis, is a short-lived phosphoprotein. However, the precise balance and regulatory mechanism of the stability and phosphorylation of HYL1 remain unclear. Here, we show that a highly conserved PP4 (Protein Phosphatase 4) and SMEK1 (Suppressor of MEK 1) complex dephosphorylates HYL1 to promote miRNA biogenesis, by antagonizing the MAPK cascade in Arabidopsis. The smek1 mutants exhibit defective miRNA biogenesis due to accelerated degradation of HYL1. SMEK1 stabilizes HYL1 in a dual manner: SMEK1, as a suppressor, inhibits MAPK activation to attenuate HYL1 phosphorylation; SMEK1 assembles a functional PP4 to target HYL1 for dephosphorylation. Moreover, the protein level of SMEK1 is increased in response to abscisic acid. Our results provide insights into the delicate balance between a protein kinase and a phosphatase during miRNA biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Although it is well established that tumor-associated macrophages take part in each step of cancer progression, less is known about the distinct role of the so-called metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs) at the metastatic site. Previous studies reported that Caveolin-1 (Cav1) has both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive functions. However, the role of Cav1 in bone-marrow-derived cells is unknown. Here, we describe Cav1 as an anti-metastatic regulator in mouse models of lung and breast cancer pulmonary metastasis. Among all the recruited inflammatory cell populations, we show that MAMs uniquely express abundant levels of Cav1. Using clodronate depletion of macrophages, we demonstrate that macrophage Cav1 signaling is critical for metastasis and not for primary tumor growth. In particular, Cav1 inhibition does not affect MAM recruitment to the metastatic site but, in turn, favors angiogenesis. We describe a mechanism by which Cav1 in MAMs specifically restrains vascular endothelial growth factor A/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGF-A/VEGFR1) signaling and its downstream effectors, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1).

Abstract: Summary
Although NOD2 is the major inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility gene, its role in colorectal tumorigenesis is poorly defined. Here, we show that Nod2-deficient mice are highly susceptible to experimental colorectal tumorigenesis independent of gut microbial dysbiosis. Interestingly, the expression of inflammatory genes and the activation of inflammatory pathways, including NF-κB, ERK, and STAT3 are significantly higher in Nod2−/− mouse colons during colitis and colorectal tumorigenesis, but not at homeostasis. Consistent with higher inflammation, there is greater proliferation of epithelial cells in hyperplastic regions of Nod2−/− colons. In vitro studies demonstrate that, while NOD2 activates the NF-κB and MAPK pathways in response to MDP, it inhibits TLR-mediated activation of NF-κB and MAPK. Notably, NOD2-mediated downregulation of NF-κB and MAPK is associated with the induction of IRF4. Taken together, NOD2 plays a critical role in the suppression of inflammation and tumorigenesis in the colon via downregulation of the TLR signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Sex hormones regulate many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including asthma. As adults, asthma prevalence is 2-fold greater in women compared to men. The number of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) is increased in patients with asthma, and we investigate how testosterone attenuates ILC2 function. In patients with moderate to severe asthma, we determine that women have an increased number of circulating ILC2 compared to men. ILC2 from adult female mice have increased IL-2-mediated ILC2 proliferation versus ILC2 from adult male mice, as well as pre-pubescent females and males. Further, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, a hormone downstream of testosterone, decreases lung ILC2 numbers and IL-5 and IL-13 expression from ILC2. In vivo, testosterone attenuated Alternaria-extract-induced IL-5+ and IL-13+ ILC2 numbers and lung eosinophils by intrinsically decreasing lung ILC2 numbers, as well as by decreasing expression of IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), ILC2-stimulating cytokines. Collectively, these findings provide a foundational understanding of sexual dimorphism in ILC2 function.

Abstract: Summary
MyoD is a master regulator of myogenesis. Chromatin modifications required to trigger MyoD expression are still poorly described. Here, we demonstrate that the histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1a is recruited on the MyoD core enhancer upon muscle differentiation. Depletion of Lsd1 in myoblasts precludes the removal of H3K9 methylation and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II on the core enhancer, thereby preventing transcription of the non-coding enhancer RNA required for MyoD expression (CEeRNA). Consistently, Lsd1 conditional inactivation in muscle progenitor cells during embryogenesis prevented transcription of the CEeRNA and delayed MyoD expression. Our results demonstrate that LSD1 is required for the timely expression of MyoD in limb buds and identify a new biological function for LSD1 by showing that it can activate RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of enhancers.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity has become a global issue, and the overconsumption of food is thought to be a major contributor. However, the regulatory neural circuits that regulate palatable food consumption remain unclear. Here, we report that somatostatin (SOM) neurons and GABAergic (VGAT) neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) play specific roles in regulating feeding. Optogenetic stimulation of BF SOM neurons increased fat and sucrose intake within minutes and promoted anxiety-like behaviors. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of projections from BF SOM neurons to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) selectively resulted in fat intake. In addition, activation of BF VGAT neurons rapidly induced general food intake and gnawing behaviors. Whole-brain mapping of inputs and outputs showed that BF SOM neurons form bidirectional connections with several brain areas important in feeding and regulation of emotion. Collectively, these results suggest that BF SOM neurons play a selective role in hedonic feeding.

Abstract: Summary
Death of cochlear hair cells, which do not regenerate, is a cause of hearing loss in a high percentage of the population. Currently, no approach exists to obtain large numbers of cochlear hair cells. Here, using a small-molecule approach, we show significant expansion (>2,000-fold) of cochlear supporting cells expressing and maintaining Lgr5, an epithelial stem cell marker, in response to stimulation of Wnt signaling by a GSK3β inhibitor and transcriptional activation by a histone deacetylase inhibitor. The Lgr5-expressing cells differentiate into hair cells in high yield. From a single mouse cochlea, we obtained over 11,500 hair cells, compared to less than 200 in the absence of induction. The newly generated hair cells have bundles and molecular machinery for transduction, synapse formation, and specialized hair cell activity. Targeting supporting cells capable of proliferation and cochlear hair cell replacement could lead to the discovery of hearing loss treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Bone metastasis is a major health threat to breast cancer patients. Tumor-derived Jagged1 represents a central node in mediating tumor-stromal interactions that promote osteolytic bone metastasis. Here, we report the development of a highly effective fully human monoclonal antibody against Jagged1 (clone 15D11). In addition to its inhibitory effect on bone metastasis of Jagged1-expressing tumor cells, 15D11 dramatically sensitizes bone metastasis to chemotherapy, which induces Jagged1 expression in osteoblasts to provide a survival niche for cancer cells. We further confirm the bone metastasis-promoting function of osteoblast-derived Jagged1 using osteoblast-specific Jagged1 transgenic mouse model. These findings establish 15D11 as a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention or treatment of bone metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer. Bcl-2 and p53 represent two important nodes in apoptosis signaling pathways. We find that concomitant p53 activation and Bcl-2 inhibition overcome apoptosis resistance and markedly prolong survival in three mouse models of resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mechanistically, p53 activation negatively regulates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and activates GSK3 to modulate Mcl-1 phosphorylation and promote its degradation, thus overcoming AML resistance to Bcl-2 inhibition. Moreover, Bcl-2 inhibition reciprocally overcomes apoptosis resistance to p53 activation by switching cellular response from G1 arrest to apoptosis. The efficacy, together with the mechanistic findings, reveals the potential of simultaneously targeting these two apoptosis regulators and provides a rational basis for clinical testing of this therapeutic approach.

Abstract: Summary
Yeast use the ring-shaped Dam1 complex to slide down depolymerizing microtubules to move chromosomes, but current models suggest that other eukaryotes do not have a sliding ring. We visualized Ndc80 and Ska complexes on microtubules by electron microscopic tomography to identify the structure of the human kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Ndc80 recruits the Ska complex so that the V shape of the Ska dimer interacts along protofilaments. We identify a mutant of the Ndc80 tail that is deficient in Ska recruitment to kinetochores and in orienting Ska along protofilaments in vitro. This mutant Ndc80 binds microtubules with normal affinity but is deficient in clustering along protofilaments. We propose that Ska is recruited to kinetochores by clusters of Ndc80 proteins and that our structure of Ndc80 and Ska complexes on microtubules suggests a mechanism for metazoan kinetochores to couple the depolymerization of microtubules to power the movement of chromosomes.

Abstract: Oleanolic acid (OA) has neurotrophic effects on neurons, although its use as a neurological drug requires further research. In the present study, we investigated the effects of OA and OA derivatives on the neuronal differentiation of rat hippocampal neural progenitor cells. In addition, we investigated whether the class II histone deacetylase (HDAC) 5 mediates the gene expression induced by OA. We found that OA and OA derivatives induced the formation of neurite spines and the expression of synapse-related molecules. OA and OA derivatives stimulated HDAC5 phosphorylation, and concurrently the nuclear export of HDCA5 and the expression of HDAC5 target genes, indicating that OA and OA derivatives induce neural differentiation and synapse formation via a pathway that involves HDAC5 phosphorylation.

Abstract: In this study, qRT-PCR was employed to identify that miR-186 expression level in NSCLC tissues are highly associated with lymph node metastasis. In addition, through the application of western blotting, luciferase assay and qRT-PCR, it was found that miR-186 targeted 3′UTR of cdc42 mRNA and down-regulated cdc42 protein level in a post-transcriptional manner. Transwell assay indicated that cdc42 partially reversed the effect of miR-186 mimics. Besides, miR-186 was proved to regulate EMT by influencing biomarkers of this process and cell adhesion ability. Thus, miR-186 is a potential target for NSCLC therapy. miR-186 is proposed to be one of tumor-suppressors and may serve as a therapeutic target in NSCLC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Cognitive vocal control is indispensable for human language. Frontal lobe areas are involved in initiating purposeful vocalizations, but their functions remain elusive. We explored the respective roles of frontal lobe areas in initiating volitional vocalizations. Macaques were trained to vocalize in response to visual cues. Recordings from the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) revealed single-neuron and population activity differences. Pre-vocal activity appeared first after the go cue in vlPFC, showing onset activity that was tightly linked to vocal reaction times. However, pre-vocal ACC onset activity was not indicative of call timing; instead, ramping activity reaching threshold values betrayed call onset. Neurons in preSMA showed weakest correlation with volitional call initiation and timing. These results suggest that vlPFC encodes the decision to produce volitional calls, whereas downstream ACC represents a motivational preparatory signal, followed by a general motor priming signal in preSMA.

Abstract: Neurons undergo dramatic changes in their gene expression profiles in response to synaptic stimulation. The coupling of neuronal excitation to gene transcription is well studied and is mediated by signaling pathways activated by cytoplasmic and nuclear calcium transients. Despite this, the minimum synaptic activity required to induce gene expression remains unknown. To address this, we used cultured hippocampal neurons and cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescence in situ hybridization (catFISH) that allows detection of nascent transcripts in the cell nucleus. We found that a single burst of action potentials, consisting of 24.4±5.1 action potentials during a 6.7±1.9s depolarization of 19.5±2.0mV causing a 9.3±0.9s somatic calcium transient, is sufficient to activate transcription of the immediate early gene arc (also known as Arg3.1). The total arc mRNA yield produced after a single burst-induced nuclear calcium transient was very small and, compared to unstimulated control neurons, did not lead to a significant increase in arc mRNA levels measured using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) of cell lysates. Significantly increased arc mRNA levels became detectable in hippocampal neurons that had undergone 5–8 consecutive burst-induced nuclear calcium transients at 0.05–0.15Hz. These results indicate that a single burst-induced nuclear calcium transient can activate gene expression and that transcription is rapidly shut off after synaptic stimulation has ceased.

Abstract: Summary
Srs2 is a superfamily 1 (SF1) helicase and antirecombinase that is required for genome integrity. However, the mechanisms that regulate Srs2 remain poorly understood. Here, we visualize Srs2 as it acts upon single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) bound by the Rad51 recombinase. We demonstrate that Srs2 is a processive translocase capable of stripping thousands of Rad51 molecules from ssDNA at a rate of ∼50 monomers/s. We show that Srs2 is recruited to RPA clusters embedded between Rad51 filaments and that multimeric arrays of Srs2 assemble during translocation on ssDNA through a mechanism involving iterative Srs2 loading events at sites cleared of Rad51. We also demonstrate that Srs2 acts on heteroduplex DNA joints through two alternative pathways, both of which result in rapid disruption of the heteroduplex intermediate. On the basis of these findings, we present a model describing the recruitment and regulation of Srs2 as it acts upon homologous recombination intermediates.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity-induced white adipose tissue (WAT) fibrosis is believed to accelerate WAT dysfunction. However, the cellular origin of WAT fibrosis remains unclear. Here, we show that adipocyte platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α-positive (PDGFRα+) progenitors adopt a fibrogenic phenotype in obese mice prone to visceral WAT fibrosis. More specifically, a subset of PDGFRα+ cells with high CD9 expression (CD9high) originates pro-fibrotic cells whereas their CD9low counterparts, committed to adipogenesis, are almost completely lost in the fibrotic WAT. PDGFRα pathway activation promotes a phenotypic shift toward PDGFRα+CD9high fibrogenic cells, driving pathological remodeling and altering WAT function in obesity. These findings translated to human obesity as the frequency of CD9high progenitors in omental WAT (oWAT) correlates with oWAT fibrosis level, insulin-resistance severity, and type 2 diabetes. Collectively, our data demonstrate that in addition to representing a WAT adipogenic niche, different PDGFRα+ cell subsets modulate obesity-induced WAT fibrogenesis and are associated with loss of metabolic fitness.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular metabolite balance and mitochondrial function are under circadian control, but the pathways connecting the molecular clock to these functions are unclear. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) enables preferential utilization of lipids as fuel during exercise and is a major driver of exercise endurance. We show here that the circadian repressors CRY1 and CRY2 function as co-repressors for PPARδ. Cry1−/−;Cry2−/− myotubes and muscles exhibit elevated expression of PPARδ target genes, particularly in the context of exercise. Notably, CRY1/2 seem to repress a distinct subset of PPARδ target genes in muscle compared to the co-repressor NCOR1. In vivo, genetic disruption of Cry1 and Cry2 enhances sprint exercise performance in mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that CRY1 and CRY2 modulate exercise physiology by altering the activity of several transcription factors, including CLOCK/BMAL1 and PPARδ, and thereby alter energy storage and substrate selection for energy production.

Abstract: The transient receptor potential canonical channel 5 (TRPC5) is a Ca2+-permeable ion channel, which is predominantly expressed in the brain. TRPC5-deficient mice exhibit a reduced innate fear response and impaired motor control. In addition, outgrowth of hippocampal and cerebellar neurons is retarded by TRPC5. However, pharmacological evidence of TRPC5 function on cellular or organismic levels is sparse. Thus, there is still a need for identifying novel and efficient TRPC5 channel modulators. We, therefore, screened compound libraries and identified the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone and N-[3-(adamantan-2-yloxy)propyl]-3-(6-methyl-1,1-dioxo-2H-1λ6,2,4-benzothiadiazin-3-yl)propanamide (BTD) as novel TRPC5 activators. Comparisons with closely related chemical structures from the same libraries indicate important substructures for compound efficacy. Methylprednisolone activates TRPC5 heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells with an EC50 of 12μM, while BTD-induced half-maximal activation is achieved with 5-fold lower concentrations, both in Ca2+ assays (EC50=1.4μM) and in electrophysiological whole cell patch clamp recordings (EC50=1.3 μM). The activation resulting from both compounds is long lasting, reversible and sensitive to clemizole, a recently established TRPC5 inhibitor. No influence of BTD on homotetrameric members of the remaining TRPC family was observed. On the main sensory TRP channels (TRPA1, TRPV1, TRPM3, TRPM8) BTD exerts only minor activity. Furthermore, BTD can activate heteromeric channel complexes consisting of TRPC5 and its closest relatives TRPC1 or TRPC4, suggesting a high selectivity of BTD for channel complexes bearing at least one TRPC5 subunit.

Abstract: The spermatozoon of the Carib grackle, Quiscalus lugubris, a member of the family Icteridae, is generally similar in organization to the passerine-type of spermatozoon, in being highly elongated and displaying a helical structure of the acrosome, nucleus and principal piece of the tail. There are subtle variations in acrosomal structural features between this organelle in the grackle and that in some of the very few passerine species of birds in which the spermatozoon has been studied. The proximal centriole is present, and, thus, the Carib grackle is the third passeridan bird in which this organelle, hitherto regarded as absent in passerine birds, has been described in the spermatozoon. The spermatozoon of this bird also possesses a granular helix, which feature has been found variably even in the scanty available reports on passerine spermatozoa. It is advocated that the spermatozoon be studied in many more species of this large clade of birds. This report provides a basis for the study of spermiogenesis in the Carib grackle, with the aim of exposing, inter alia, a number of developmental features and processes of certain organelles that have received attention, recently, in the spermatozoa of passerine birds.

Abstract: Summary
While the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) gene functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of cancer types, we explored its oncogenic role in breast tumorigenesis. The MEN1 gene product menin is involved in H3K4 trimethylation and co-activates transcription. We integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to identify menin target genes. Our analysis revealed that menin-dependent target gene promoters display looping to distal enhancers that are bound by menin, FOXA1 and GATA3. In this fashion, MEN1 co-regulates a proliferative breast cancer-specific gene expression program in ER+ cells. In primary mammary cells, MEN1 exerts an anti-proliferative function by regulating a distinct expression signature. Our findings clarify the cell-type-specific functions of MEN1 and inform the development of menin-directed treatments for breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Binge eating (BE) is a common aberrant form of eating behavior, characterized by overconsumption of food in a brief period of time. Recurrent episodes of BE constitute the BE disorder, which mostly affects females and is associated with early-life adversities. Here, we show that corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)-induced prenatal stress (PNS) in late gestation predisposes female offspring to BE-like behavior that coincides with hypomethylation of hypothalamic miR-1a and downstream dysregulation of the melanocortin system through Pax7/Pax3. Moreover, exposing the offspring to a methyl-balanced diet during adolescence prevents the dysregulation and predisposition from being triggered. We demonstrate that gestational programming, per se, will not lead to BE-like behavior, but pre-existing alterations due to prenatal programming are revealed only when challenged during adolescence. We provide experimental evidence for long-term epigenetic abnormalities stemming from PNS in predisposing female offspring to BE disorder as well as a potential non-invasive prevention strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Although optimizing decisions between drives to avoid pain and to obtain reward are critical for survival, understanding the neuronal circuit activity that regulates choice during approach-avoidance conflicts is limited. Here, we recorded neuronal activity in the infralimbic (IL) cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc) during an approach-avoidance task. In this task, disruption of approach by a pain-predictive cue (PPC-avoidance) is extinguished by experience and reinstated in a model of chronic pain. In the IL-NAc circuit, the activity of distinct subpopulations of neurons predicts the extent of PPC-avoidance observed. Furthermore, chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations establish that IL-NAc circuitry regulates PPC-avoidance behavior. Our results indicate that IL-NAc circuitry is engaged during approach-avoidance conflicts, and modifications of this circuit by experience and chronic pain determine whether approach or avoidance occurs.

Abstract: Summary
Basement membranes (BMs) are specialized extracellular matrices required for tissue organization and organ formation. We study the role of laminin and its integrin receptor in the regulation of tissue migration during Drosophila oogenesis. Egg production in Drosophila involves the collective migration of follicle cells (FCs) over the BM to shape the mature egg. We show that laminin content in the BM increases with time, whereas integrin amounts in FCs do not vary significantly. Manipulation of integrin and laminin levels reveals that a dynamic balance of integrin-laminin amounts determines the onset and speed of FC migration. Thus, the interplay of ligand-receptor levels regulates tissue migration in vivo. Laminin depletion also affects the ultrastructure and biophysical properties of the BM and results in anterior-posterior misorientation of developing follicles. Laminin emerges as a key player in the regulation of collective cell migration, tissue stiffness, and the organization of anterior-posterior polarity in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome participates in numerous physiologic functions and communicates intimately with the host immune system. Antimicrobial peptides are critical components of intestinal innate immunity. We report a prominent role for antimicrobials secreted by pancreatic acini in shaping the gut microbiome that is essential for intestinal innate immunity, barrier function, and survival. Deletion of the Ca2+ channel Orai1 in pancreatic acini of adult mice resulted in 60%–70% mortality within 3 weeks. Despite robust activation of the intestinal innate immune response, mice lacking acinar Orai1 exhibited intestinal bacterial outgrowth and dysbiosis, ultimately causing systemic translocation, inflammation, and death. While digestive enzyme supplementation was ineffective, treatments constraining bacterial outgrowth (purified liquid diet, broad-spectrum antibiotics) rescued survival, feeding, and weight gain. Pancreatic levels of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) were reduced, and supplement of synthetic CRAMP prevented intestinal disease. These findings reveal a critical role for antimicrobial pancreatic secretion in gut innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
We performed genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic characterizations of uterine carcinosarcomas (UCSs). Cohort samples had extensive copy-number alterations and highly recurrent somatic mutations. Frequent mutations were found in TP53, PTEN, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, FBXW7, and KRAS, similar to endometrioid and serous uterine carcinomas. Transcriptome sequencing identified a strong epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene signature in a subset of cases that was attributable to epigenetic alterations at microRNA promoters. The range of EMT scores in UCS was the largest among all tumor types studied via The Cancer Genome Atlas. UCSs shared proteomic features with gynecologic carcinomas and sarcomas with intermediate EMT features. Multiple somatic mutations and copy-number alterations in genes that are therapeutic targets were identified.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza is a worldwide health and financial burden posing a significant risk to the immune-compromised, obese, diabetic, elderly, and pediatric populations. We identified increases in glucose metabolism in the lungs of pediatric patients infected with respiratory pathogens. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we found metabolic changes occurring after influenza infection in primary human respiratory cells and validated infection-associated increases in c-Myc, glycolysis, and glutaminolysis. We confirmed these findings with a metabolic drug screen that identified the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 as a regulator of infectious virus production. BEZ235 treatment ablated the transient induction of c-Myc, restored PI3K/mTOR pathway homeostasis measured by 4E-BP1 and p85 phosphorylation, and reversed infection-induced changes in metabolism. Importantly, BEZ235 reduced infectious progeny but had no effect on the early stages of viral replication. BEZ235 significantly increased survival in mice, while reducing viral titer. We show metabolic reprogramming of host cells by influenza virus exposes targets for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) induces necroptosis, a type of regulated necrosis, through its kinase domain and receptor interacting protein (RIP) homotypic interaction motif (RHIM). In addition, RIPK3 has been shown to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. However, the relative contribution of these signaling pathways to RIPK3-dependent inflammation in distinct immune effectors is unknown. To investigate these questions, we generated RIPK3-GFP reporter mice. We found that colonic CD11c+CD11b+CD14+ mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) expressed the highest level of RIPK3 in the lamina propria. Consequently, deletion of the RIPK3 RHIM in CD11c+ cells alone was sufficient to impair dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-1β expression, leading to severe intestinal inflammation. In contrast, mice expressing kinase inactive RIPK3 were not hypersensitive to DSS. Thus, a key physiological function of RIPK3 is to promote reparative cytokine expression through intestinal CD11c+ MNPs in a kinase- and necroptosis-independent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Adenoviruses (Ads) are large human-pathogenic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses presenting an enormous natural diversity associated with a broad variety of diseases. However, only a small fraction of adenoviruses has been explored in basic virology and biomedical research, highlighting the need to develop robust and adaptable methodologies and resources. We developed a method for high-throughput direct cloning and engineering of adenoviral genomes from different sources utilizing advanced linear-linear homologous recombination (LLHR) and linear-circular homologous recombination (LCHR). We describe 34 cloned adenoviral genomes originating from clinical samples, which were characterized by next-generation sequencing (NGS). We anticipate that this recombineering strategy and the engineered adenovirus library will provide an approach to study basic and clinical virology. High-throughput screening (HTS) of the reporter-tagged Ad library in a panel of cell lines including osteosarcoma disease-specific cell lines revealed alternative virus types with enhanced transduction and oncolysis efficiencies. This highlights the usefulness of this resource.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanism by which inflammation influences the adaptive response to vaccines is not fully understood. Here, we examine the role of lymph node macrophages (LNMs) in the induction of the cytokine storm triggered by inactivated influenza virus vaccine. Following vaccination, LNMs undergo inflammasome-independent necrosis-like death that is reliant on MyD88 and Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) expression and releases pre-stored interleukin-1α (IL-1α). Furthermore, activated medullary macrophages produce interferon-β (IFN-β) that induces the autocrine secretion of IL-1α. We also found that macrophage depletion promotes lymph node-resident dendritic cell (LNDC) relocation and affects the capacity of CD11b+ LNDCs to capture virus and express co-stimulatory molecules. Inhibition of the IL-1α-induced inflammatory cascade reduced B cell responses, while co-administration of recombinant IL-1α increased the humoral response. Stimulation of the IL-1α inflammatory pathway might therefore represent a strategy to enhance antigen presentation by LNDCs and improve the humoral response against influenza vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of the ATPase cycle of the HSP90 chaperone promotes ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of its client proteins, which include many oncogenic protein kinases. This provides the rationale for HSP90 inhibitors as cancer therapeutics. However, the mechanism by which HSP90 ATPase inhibition triggers ubiquitylation is not understood, and the E3 ubiquitin ligases involved are largely unknown. Using a siRNA screen, we have identified components of two independent degradation pathways for the HSP90 client kinase CRAF. The first requires CUL5, Elongin B, and Elongin C, while the second requires the E3 ligase HECTD3, which is also involved in the degradation of MASTL and LKB1. HECTD3 associates with HSP90 and CRAF in cells via its N-terminal DOC domain, which is mutationally disrupted in tumor cells with activated MAP kinase signaling. Our data implicate HECTD3 as a tumor suppressor modulating the activity of this important oncogenic signaling pathway.

Abstract: Dietary supplements have exhibited myriads of positive health effects on human health conditions and with the advent of new technological advances, including in the fields of proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics, biological and pharmacological activities of dietary supplements are being evaluated for their ameliorative effects in human ailments. Recent interests in understanding and discovering the molecular targets of phytochemical-gene-protein-metabolite dynamics resulted in discovery of a few protein signature candidates that could potentially be used to assess the effects of dietary supplements on human health. Persimmon (Diospyros kaki) is a folk medicine, commonly used as dietary supplement in China, Japan, and South Korea, owing to its different beneficial health effects including anti-diabetic implications. However, neither mechanism of action nor molecular biomarkers have been discovered that could either validate or be used to evaluate effects of persimmon on human health. In present study, Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic studies were accomplished to discover proteomic molecular signatures that could be used to understand therapeutic potentials of persimmon leaf extract (PLE) in diabetes amelioration. Saliva, serum, and urine samples were analyzed and we propose that salivary proteins can be used for evaluating treatment effectiveness and in improving patient compliance. The present discovery proteomics study demonstrates that salivary proteomic profile changes were found as a result of PLE treatment in prediabetic subjects that could specifically be used as potential protein signature candidates.

Abstract: Summary
Telomeres employ TRF2 to protect chromosome ends from activating the DNA damage sensor MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN), thereby repressing ATM-dependent DNA damage checkpoint responses. How TRF2 prevents MRN activation at dysfunctional telomeres is unclear. Here, we show that the phosphorylation status of NBS1 determines the repair pathway choice of dysfunctional telomeres. The crystal structure of the TRF2-NBS1 complex at 3.0 Å resolution shows that the NBS1 429YQLSP433 motif interacts specifically with the TRF2TRFH domain. Phosphorylation of NBS1 serine 432 by CDK2 in S/G2 dissociates NBS1 from TRF2, promoting TRF2-Apollo/SNM1B complex formation and the protection of leading-strand telomeres. Classical-NHEJ-mediated repair of telomeres lacking TRF2 requires phosphorylated NBS1S432 to activate ATM, while interaction of de-phosphorylated NBS1S432 with TRF2 promotes alternative-NHEJ repair of telomeres lacking POT1-TPP1. Our work advances understanding of how the TRF2TRFH domain orchestrates telomere end protection and reveals how the phosphorylation status of the NBS1S432 dictates repair pathway choice of dysfunctional telomeres.

Abstract: Summary
Potentially harmful stimuli are detected at the skin by nociceptor sensory neurons that drive rapid protective withdrawal reflexes and pain. We set out to define, at a millisecond timescale, the relationship between the activity of these sensory neurons and the resultant behavioral output. Brief optogenetic activation of cutaneous nociceptors was found to activate only a single action potential in each fiber. This minimal input was used to determine high-speed behavioral responses in freely behaving mice. The localized stimulus generated widespread dynamic repositioning and alerting sub-second behaviors whose nature and timing depended on the context of the animal and its position, activity, and alertness. Our findings show that the primary response to injurious stimuli is not limited, fixed, or localized, but is dynamic, and that it involves recruitment and gating of multiple circuits distributed throughout the central nervous system at a sub-second timescale to effectively both alert to the presence of danger and minimize risk of harm.

Abstract: Summary
The integrated stress response (ISR) is a homeostatic mechanism induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In acute/transient ER stress, decreased global protein synthesis and increased uORF mRNA translation are followed by normalization of protein synthesis. Here, we report a dramatically different response during chronic ER stress. This chronic ISR program is characterized by persistently elevated uORF mRNA translation and concurrent gene expression reprogramming, which permits simultaneous stress sensing and proteostasis. The program includes PERK-dependent switching to an eIF3-dependent translation initiation mechanism, resulting in partial, but not complete, translational recovery, which, together with transcriptional reprogramming, selectively bolsters expression of proteins with ER functions. Coordination of transcriptional and translational reprogramming prevents ER dysfunction and inhibits “foamy cell” development, thus establishing a molecular basis for understanding human diseases associated with ER dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical and genetic heterogeneity associated with retinal diseases makes stem-cell-based therapies an attractive strategy for personalized medicine. However, we have limited understanding of the timing of key events in the developing human retina, and in particular the factors critical for generating the unique architecture of the fovea and surrounding macula. Here we define three key epochs in the transcriptome dynamics of human retina from fetal day (D) 52 to 136. Coincident histological analyses confirmed the cellular basis of transcriptional changes and highlighted the dramatic acceleration of development in the fovea compared with peripheral retina. Human and mouse retinal transcriptomes show remarkable similarity in developmental stages, although morphogenesis was greatly expanded in humans. Integration of DNA accessibility data allowed us to reconstruct transcriptional networks controlling photoreceptor differentiation. Our studies provide insights into human retinal development and serve as a resource for molecular staging of human stem-cell-derived retinal organoids.

Abstract: Summary
From birth onward, the lungs are exposed to the external environment and therefore harbor a complex immunological milieu to protect this organ from damage and infection. We investigated the homeostatic role of the epithelium-derived alarmin interleukin-33 (IL-33) in newborn mice and discovered the immediate upregulation of IL-33 from the first day of life, closely followed by a wave of IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), which coincided with the appearance of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and their early polarization to an IL-13-dependent anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. ILC2s contributed to lung quiescence in homeostasis by polarizing tissue resident AMs and induced an M2 phenotype in transplanted macrophage progenitors. ILC2s continued to maintain the M2 AM phenotype during adult life at the cost of a delayed response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice. These data highlight the homeostatic role of ILC2s in setting the activation threshold in the lung and underline their implications in anti-bacterial defenses.

Abstract: Nitrogen is one of the most important mineral elements for plant growth. We studied the functional roles of Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 18 (OsDOF18) in controlling ammonium uptake. The growth of null mutants of OsDOF18 was retarded in a medium containing ammonium as the sole nitrogen source. In contrast, those mutants grew normally in a medium with nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. The gene expression was induced by ammonium but not by nitrate. Uptake of ammonium was lower in osdof18 mutants than in the wild type, while that of nitrate was not affected by the mutation. This indicated that OsDOF18 is involved in regulating ammonium transport. Among the 10 ammonium transporter genes examined here, expression of OsAMT1;1, OsAMT1;3, OsAMT2;1, and OsAMT4;1 was reduced in osdof18 mutants, demonstrating that the ammonium transporter genes function downstream of OsDOF18. Genes for nitrogen assimilation were also affected in the mutants. These results provide evidence that OsDOF18 mediates ammonium transport and nitrogen distribution, which then affects nitrogen use efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is considered incurable with currently available treatments, highlighting the need for therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers. Here, we report a unique role for Bcl-2-associated athanogene 2 (BAG2), which is significantly overexpressed in TNBC, in regulating the dual functions of cathepsin B as either a pro- or anti-oncogenic enzyme. Silencing BAG2 suppresses tumorigenesis and lung metastasis and induces apoptosis by increasing the intracellular mature form of cathepsin B, whereas BAG2 expression induces metastasis by blocking the auto-cleavage processing of pro-cathepsin B via interaction with the propeptide region. BAG2 regulates pro-cathepsin B/annexin II complex formation and facilitates the trafficking of pro-cathespin-B-containing TGN38-positive vesicles toward the cell periphery, leading to the secretion of pro-cathepsin B, which induces metastasis. Collectively, our results uncover BAG2 as a regulator of the oncogenic function of pro-cathepsin B and a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target that may reduce the burden of metastatic breast cancer.

Abstract: Single-cell derived bovine induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated by the introduction of piggyBac transposons with CAG promoting transcription factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc). In the study, the bovine iPSCs colony from single cell could passage more than 50 passages after enzymatic dissociation into single cells. These bovine iPSCs cells kept the normal karyotype and displayed dome shaped clones similar to mouse embryonic stem cells. They showed pluripotency in many ways, including their expression of pluripotency markers, such as OCT3/4, NANOG, SOX2, SSEA1, SSEA4, and AP in immunofluorescence assay, Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc in RT-PCR. Additionally, single-cell derived bovine iPSCs formed embryoid bodies and teratomas that all subsequently gave rise to differentiated cells from all three embryonic germ layers. The results showed that our reprogramming method could obtain high efficiency single-cell cloning bovine iPSCs, and the efficiency of single cell cloning is 40%.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian embryos transiently exhibit aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), a metabolic adaptation also observed in cancer cells. The role of this particular type of metabolism during vertebrate organogenesis is currently unknown. Here, we provide evidence for spatiotemporal regulation of glycolysis in the posterior region of mouse and chicken embryos. We show that a posterior glycolytic gradient is established in response to graded transcription of glycolytic enzymes downstream of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. We demonstrate that glycolysis controls posterior elongation of the embryonic axis by regulating cell motility in the presomitic mesoderm and by controlling specification of the paraxial mesoderm fate in the tail bud. Our results suggest that glycolysis in the tail bud coordinates Wnt and FGF signaling to promote elongation of the embryonic axis.

Abstract: Summary
Telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1) is essential to the maintenance of telomere chromatin structure and integrity. However, how telomere integrity is maintained, especially in response to damage, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify Nek7, a member of the Never in Mitosis Gene A (NIMA) kinase family, as a regulator of telomere integrity. Nek7 is recruited to telomeres and stabilizes TRF1 at telomeres after damage in an ATM activation-dependent manner. Nek7 deficiency leads to telomere aberrations, long-lasting γH2AX and 53BP1 foci, and augmented cell death upon oxidative telomeric DNA damage. Mechanistically, Nek7 interacts with and phosphorylates TRF1 on Ser114, which prevents TRF1 from binding to Fbx4, an Skp1-Cul1-F box E3 ligase subunit, thereby alleviating proteasomal degradation of TRF1, leading to a stable association of TRF1 with Tin2 to form a shelterin complex. Our data reveal a mechanism of efficient protection of telomeres from damage through Nek7-dependent stabilization of TRF1.

Abstract: Summary
The anti-FcRH5/CD3 T cell-dependent bispecific antibody (TDB) targets the B cell lineage marker FcRH5 expressed in multiple myeloma (MM) tumor cells. We demonstrate that TDBs trigger T cell receptor activation by inducing target clustering and exclusion of CD45 phosphatase from the synapse. The dimensions of the target molecule play a key role in the efficiency of the synapse formation. The anti-FcRH5/CD3 TDB kills human plasma cells and patient-derived myeloma cells at picomolar concentrations and results in complete depletion of B cells and bone marrow plasma cells in cynomolgus monkeys. These data demonstrate the potential for the anti-FcRH5/CD3 TDB, alone or in combination with inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, in the treatment of MM and other B cell malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the pathways that lead to vasculogenic cells, and being able to identify their progenitors and lineage-restricted cells, is critical to the establishment of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) models for vascular diseases and development of vascular therapies. Here, we find that mesoderm-derived pericytes (PCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) originate from a clonal mesenchymal progenitor mesenchymoangioblast (MB). In clonogenic cultures, MBs differentiate into primitive PDGFRβ+CD271+CD73− mesenchymal progenitors, which give rise to proliferative PCs, SMCs, and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells. MB-derived PCs can be further specified to CD274+ capillary and DLK1+ arteriolar PCs with a proinflammatory and contractile phenotype, respectively. SMC maturation was induced using a MEK inhibitor. Establishing the vasculogenic lineage tree, along with identification of stage- and lineage-specific markers, provides a platform for interrogating the molecular mechanisms that regulate vasculogenic cell specification and diversification and manufacturing well-defined mural cell populations for vascular engineering and cellular therapies from hPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) trafficking and function underpin excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity and shape neuronal networks. It is well established that the transcription, translation, and endocytosis/recycling of iGluRs are all regulated by neuronal activity, but much less is known about the activity dependence of iGluR transport through the secretory pathway. Here, we use the kainate receptor subunit GluK2 as a model iGluR cargo to show that the assembly, early secretory pathway trafficking, and surface delivery of iGluRs are all controlled by neuronal activity. We show that the delivery of de novo kainate receptors is differentially regulated by modulation of GluK2 Q/R editing, PKC phosphorylation, and PDZ ligand interactions. These findings reveal that, in addition to short-term regulation of iGluRs by recycling/endocytosis and long-term modulation by altered transcription/translation, the trafficking of iGluRs through the secretory pathway is under tight activity-dependent control to determine the numbers and properties of surface-expressed iGluRs.

Abstract: Summary
Dbf4-dependent kinases (DDKs) are required for the initiation of DNA replication, their essential targets being the MCM2-7 proteins. We show that, in Xenopus laevis egg extracts and human cells, hyper-phosphorylation of DNA-bound Mcm4, but not phosphorylation of Mcm2, correlates with DNA replication. These phosphorylations are differentially affected by the DDK inhibitors PHA-767491 and XL413. We show that DDK-dependent MCM phosphorylation is reversed by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) targeted to chromatin by Rif1. Loss of Rif1 increased MCM phosphorylation and the rate of replication initiation and also compromised the ability of cells to block initiation when challenged with replication inhibitors. We also provide evidence that Rif1 can mediate MCM dephosphorylation at replication forks and that the stability of dephosphorylated replisomes strongly depends on Chk1 activity. We propose that both replication initiation and replisome stability depend on MCM phosphorylation, which is maintained by a balance of DDK-dependent phosphorylation and Rif1-mediated dephosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Combinatorial control of gene expression is presumed to be mediated by molecular interactions between coincident transcription factors (TFs). While information on the genome-wide locations of TFs is available, the genes they regulate and whether they function combinatorially often remain open questions. Here, we developed a mechanistic, rather than statistical, modeling approach to elucidate TF control logic from gene expression data. Applying this approach to hundreds of genes in 85 datasets measuring the transcriptional responses of murine fibroblasts and macrophages to cytokines and pathogens, we found that stimulus-responsive TFs generally function sequentially in logical OR gates or singly. Logical AND gates were found between NF-κB-responsive mRNA synthesis and MAPKp38-responsive control of mRNA half-life, but not between temporally coincident TFs. Our analyses identified the functional target genes of each of the pathogen-responsive TFs and prompt a revision of the conceptual underpinnings of combinatorial control of gene expression to include sequentially acting molecular mechanisms that govern mRNA synthesis and decay.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome frameshifting during translation of bacterial dnaX can proceed via different routes, generating a variety of distinct polypeptides. Using kinetic experiments, we show that –1 frameshifting predominantly occurs during translocation of two tRNAs bound to the slippery sequence codons. This pathway depends on a stem-loop mRNA structure downstream of the slippery sequence and operates when aminoacyl-tRNAs are abundant. However, when aminoacyl-tRNAs are in short supply, the ribosome switches to an alternative frameshifting pathway that is independent of a stem-loop. Ribosome stalling at a vacant 0-frame A-site codon results in slippage of the P-site peptidyl-tRNA, allowing for –1-frame decoding. When the –1-frame aminoacyl-tRNA is lacking, the ribosomes switch into –2 frame. Quantitative mass spectrometry shows that the –2-frame product is synthesized in vivo. We suggest that switching between frameshifting routes may enrich gene expression at conditions of aminoacyl-tRNA limitation.

Abstract: Summary
The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and aberrant SWI/SNF complexes contribute to human disease. The Snf5/SMARCB1/INI1 subunit of SWI/SNF is a tumor suppressor frequently lost in pediatric rhabdoid cancers. We examined the effects of Snf5 loss on the composition, nucleosome binding, recruitment, and remodeling activities of yeast SWI/SNF. The Snf5 subunit is shown by crosslinking-mass spectrometry (CX-MS) and subunit deletion analysis to interact with the ATPase domain of Snf2 and to form a submodule consisting of Snf5, Swp82, and Taf14. Snf5 promotes binding of the Snf2 ATPase domain to nucleosomal DNA and enhances the catalytic and nucleosome remodeling activities of SWI/SNF. Snf5 is also required for SWI/SNF recruitment by acidic transcription factors. RNA-seq analysis suggests that both the recruitment and remodeling functions of Snf5 are required in vivo for SWI/SNF regulation of gene expression. Thus, loss of SNF5 alters the structure and function of SWI/SNF.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia (pain hypersensitivity) are cardinal signs of inflammation. Although the mechanism underlying thermal hyperalgesia is well understood, the cellular and molecular basis of mechanical hyperalgesia is poorly described. Here, we have identified a subset of peptidergic C-fiber nociceptors that are insensitive to noxious mechanical stimuli under normal conditions but become sensitized to such stimuli when exposed to the inflammatory mediator nerve growth factor (NGF). Strikingly, NGF did not affect mechanosensitivity of other nociceptors. We show that these mechanoinsensitive “silent” nociceptors are characterized by the expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3 (CHRNA3) and that the mechanically gated ion channel PIEZO2 mediates NGF-induced mechanosensitivity in these neurons. Retrograde tracing revealed that CHRNA3+ nociceptors account for ∼50% of all peptidergic nociceptive afferents innervating visceral organs and deep somatic tissues. Hence, our data suggest that NGF-induced “un-silencing” of CHRNA3+ nociceptors significantly contributes to the development of mechanical hyperalgesia during inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Breast cancer stem cells (bCSCs) have been implicated in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance; however, the molecular mechanisms that define this state are unclear. We have performed two microRNA (miRNA) gain- and loss-of-function screens to identify miRNAs that regulate the choice between bCSC self-renewal and differentiation. We find that micro-RNA (miR)-600 silencing results in bCSC expansion, while its overexpression reduces bCSC self-renewal, leading to decreased in vivo tumorigenicity. miR-600 targets stearoyl desaturase 1 (SCD1), an enzyme required to produce active, lipid-modified WNT proteins. In the absence of miR-600, WNT signaling is active and promotes self-renewal, whereas overexpression of miR-600 inhibits the production of active WNT and promotes bCSC differentiation. In a series of 120 breast tumors, we found that a low level of miR-600 is correlated with active WNT signaling and a poor prognosis. These findings highlight a miR-600-centered signaling network that governs bCSC-fate decisions and influences tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
How metabolism is rewired during embryonic development is still largely unknown, as it remains a major technical challenge to resolve metabolic activities or metabolite levels with spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we investigated metabolic changes during development of organogenesis-stage mouse embryos, focusing on the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). We measured glycolytic labeling kinetics from 13C-glucose tracing experiments and detected elevated glycolysis in the posterior, more undifferentiated PSM. We found evidence that the spatial metabolic differences are functionally relevant during PSM development. To enable real-time quantification of a glycolytic metabolite with spatiotemporal resolution, we generated a pyruvate FRET-sensor reporter mouse line. We revealed dynamic changes in cytosolic pyruvate levels as cells transit toward a more anterior PSM state. Combined, our approach identifies a gradient of glycolytic activity across the PSM, and we provide evidence that these spatiotemporal metabolic changes are intrinsically linked to PSM development and differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) family kinases are central cellular regulators highly conserved in all eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis, the GSK3-like kinase BIN2 phosphorylates a range of proteins to control broad developmental processes, and BIN2 is degraded through unknown mechanism upon receptor kinase-mediated brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Here we identify KIB1 as an F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes the degradation of BIN2 while blocking its substrate access. Loss-of-function mutations of KIB1 and its homologs abolished BR-induced BIN2 degradation and caused severe BR-insensitive phenotypes. KIB1 directly interacted with BIN2 in a BR-dependent manner and promoted BIN2 ubiquitination in vitro. Expression of an F-box-truncated KIB1 caused BIN2 accumulation but dephosphorylation of its substrate BZR1 and activation of BR responses because KIB1 blocked BIN2 binding to BZR1. Our study demonstrates that KIB1 plays an essential role in BR signaling by inhibiting BIN2 through dual mechanisms of blocking substrate access and promoting degradation.

Abstract: The Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) forms the primary site of pathology in several blinding retinopathies. RPE cultures are being continuously refined so that dynamic disease processes in this important monolayer can be faithfully studied outside the eye over longer periods. The RPE substrate, which mimics the supportive Bruch’s membrane (BrM), plays a key role in determining how well in-vitro cultures recapitulate native RPE cells. Here, we evaluate how two different types of BrM substrates; (1) a commercially-available polyester transwell membrane, and (2) a novel electrospun scaffold developed in our laboratory, could support the generation of realistic RPE tissues in culture. Our findings reveal that both substrates were capable of supporting long-lasting RPE monolayers with structural and functional specialisations of in-situ RPE cells. These cultures were used to study autofluorescence and barrier formation, as well as activities such as outer-segment internalisation/trafficking and directional secretion of key proteins; the impairment of which underlies retinal disease. Hence, both substrates fulfilled important criteria for generating authentic in-vitro cultures and act as powerful tools to study RPE pathophysiology. However, RPE grown on electrospun scaffolds may be better suited to studying complex RPE-BrM interactions such as the formation of drusen-like deposits associated with early retinal disease.

Abstract: Summary
TRAIL is a potent inducer of apoptosis and has been studied almost exclusively in this context. However, TRAIL can also induce NFκB-dependent expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Surprisingly, whereas inhibition of caspase activity blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis, but not cytokine production, knock down or deletion of caspase-8 suppressed both outcomes, suggesting that caspase-8 participates in TRAIL-induced inflammatory signaling in a scaffold role. Consistent with this, introduction of a catalytically inactive caspase-8 mutant into CASP-8 null cells restored TRAIL-induced cytokine production, but not cell death. Furthermore, affinity precipitation of the native TRAIL receptor complex revealed that pro-caspase-8 was required for recruitment of RIPK1, via FADD, to promote NFκB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production downstream. Thus, caspase-8 can serve in two distinct roles in response to TRAIL receptor engagement, as a scaffold for assembly of a Caspase-8-FADD-RIPK1 “FADDosome” complex, leading to NFκB-dependent inflammation, or as a protease that promotes apoptosis.

Abstract: In the Arabidopsis genome, approximately 80 MAP3Ks (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases) have been identified. However, only a few of them have been characterized, and the functions of most MAP3Ks are largely unknown. In this paper, we report the function of MAP3K16 and several other MAP3Ks, MAP3K14/15/17/18, whose expression is salt-inducible. We prepared MAP3K16 overexpression (OX) lines and analyzed their phenotypes. The result showed that the transgenic plants were ABA-insensitive during seed germination and cotyledon greening stage but their root growth was ABA-hypersensitive. The OX lines were more susceptible to water-deficit condition at later growth stage in soil. A MAP3K16 knockout (KO) line, on the other hand, exhibited opposite phenotypes. In similar transgenic analyses, we found that MAP3K14/15/17/18 OX and KO lines displayed similar phenotypes to those of MA3K16, suggesting the functional redundancy among them. MAP3K16 possesses in vitro kinase activity, and we carried out two-hybrid analyses to identify MAP3K16 substrates. Our results indicate that MAP3K16 interacts with MKK3 and the negative regulator of ABA response, ABR1, in yeast. Furthermore, MAP3K16 recombinant protein could phosphorylate MKK3 and ABR1, suggesting that they might be MAP3K16 substrates. Collectively, our results demonstrate that MAP3K16 and MAP3K14/15/17/18 are involved in ABA response, playing negative or positive roles depending on developmental stage and that MAP3K16 may function via MKK3 and ABR1.

Abstract: Summary
The degree of genetic aberrations characteristic of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) makes identification of the molecular features that drive tumor progression difficult. Here, we perform genome-wide RNAi screens and comprehensive expression analysis of cell-surface markers in a panel of HGSC cell lines to identify genes that are critical to their survival. We report that the tetraspanin CD151 contributes to survival of a subset of HGSC cell lines associated with a ZEB transcriptional program and supports the growth of HGSC tumors. Moreover, we show that high CD151 expression is prognostic of poor clinical outcome. This study reveals cell-surface vulnerabilities associated with HGSC, provides a framework for identifying therapeutic targets, and reports a role for CD151 in HGSC.

Abstract: Summary
Massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing can precisely resolve cellular diversity in a high-throughput manner at low cost, but unbiased isolation of intact single cells from complex tissues such as adult mammalian brains is challenging. Here, we integrate sucrose-gradient-assisted purification of nuclei with droplet microfluidics to develop a highly scalable single-nucleus RNA-seq approach (sNucDrop-seq), which is free of enzymatic dissociation and nucleus sorting. By profiling ∼18,000 nuclei isolated from cortical tissues of adult mice, we demonstrate that sNucDrop-seq not only accurately reveals neuronal and non-neuronal subtype composition with high sensitivity but also enables in-depth analysis of transient transcriptional states driven by neuronal activity, at single-cell resolution, in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
We present a method for automated spike sorting for recordings with high-density, large-scale multielectrode arrays. Exploiting the dense sampling of single neurons by multiple electrodes, an efficient, low-dimensional representation of detected spikes consisting of estimated spatial spike locations and dominant spike shape features is exploited for fast and reliable clustering into single units. Millions of events can be sorted in minutes, and the method is parallelized and scales better than quadratically with the number of detected spikes. Performance is demonstrated using recordings with a 4,096-channel array and validated using anatomical imaging, optogenetic stimulation, and model-based quality control. A comparison with semi-automated, shape-based spike sorting exposes significant limitations of conventional methods. Our approach demonstrates that it is feasible to reliably isolate the activity of up to thousands of neurons and that dense, multi-channel probes substantially aid reliable spike sorting.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cell (ESC) abnormalities in genome methylation hamper the utility of their therapeutic derivatives; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase, Sirt1, selectively prevents abnormal DNA methylation of some developmental genes in murine ESCs by antagonizing Dnmt3l. Transcriptome and DNA methylome analyses demonstrated that Sirt1-null (Sirt1−/−) ESCs repress expression of a subset of imprinted and germline genes concomitant with increased DNA methylation of regulatory elements. Dnmt3l was highly expressed in Sirt1−/− ESCs, and knockdown partially rescued abnormal DNA methylation of the Sirt1 target genes. The Sirt1 protein suppressed transcription of Dnmt3l and physically interacted with the Dnmt3l protein, deacetylating and destabilizing Dnmt3l protein. Sirt1 deficiency delayed neurogenesis and spermatogenesis. These differentiation delays were significantly or partially abolished by reintroduction of Sirt1 cDNA or Dnmt3l knockdown. This study sheds light on mechanisms that restrain DNA methylation of developmentally vital genes operating in ESCs.

ER Stress Inhibits Liver Fatty Acid Oxidation while Unmitigated Stress Leads to Anorexia-Induced Lipolysis and Both Liver and Kidney Steatosis,

Abstract: Summary
The unfolded protein response (UPR), induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, regulates the expression of factors that restore protein folding homeostasis. However, in the liver and kidney, ER stress also leads to lipid accumulation, accompanied at least in the liver by transcriptional suppression of metabolic genes. The mechanisms of this accumulation, including which pathways contribute to the phenotype in each organ, are unclear. We combined gene expression profiling, biochemical assays, and untargeted lipidomics to understand the basis of stress-dependent lipid accumulation, taking advantage of enhanced hepatic and renal steatosis in mice lacking the ER stress sensor ATF6α. We found that impaired fatty acid oxidation contributed to the early development of steatosis in the liver but not the kidney, while anorexia-induced lipolysis promoted late triglyceride and free fatty acid accumulation in both organs. These findings provide evidence for both direct and indirect regulation of peripheral metabolism by ER stress.

Abstract: Summary
Induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that target HIV-1 envelope (Env) is a goal of HIV-1 vaccine development. A bnAb target is the Env third variable loop (V3)-glycan site. To determine whether immunization could induce antibodies to the V3-glycan bnAb binding site, we repetitively immunized macaques over a 4-year period with an Env expressing V3-high mannose glycans. Env immunizations elicited plasma antibodies that neutralized HIV-1 expressing only high-mannose glycans—a characteristic shared by early bnAb B cell lineage members. A rhesus recombinant monoclonal antibody from a vaccinated macaque bound to the V3-glycan site at the same amino acids as broadly neutralizing antibodies. A structure of the antibody bound to glycan revealed that the three variable heavy-chain complementarity-determining regions formed a cavity into which glycan could insert and neutralized multiple HIV-1 isolates with high-mannose glycans. Thus, HIV-1 Env vaccination induced mannose-dependent antibodies with characteristics of V3-glycan bnAb precursors.

Abstract: Summary
The hexameric AAA+ ATPases Rvb1 and Rvb2 (Rvbs) are essential for diverse processes ranging from metabolic signaling to chromatin remodeling, but their functions are unknown. While originally thought to act as helicases, recent proposals suggest that Rvbs act as protein assembly chaperones. However, experimental evidence for chaperone-like behavior is lacking. Here, we identify a potent protein activator of the Rvbs, a domain in the Ino80 ATPase subunit of the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex, termed Ino80INS. Ino80INS stimulates Rvbs’ ATPase activity by 16-fold while concomitantly promoting their dodecamerization. Using mass spectrometry, cryo-EM, and integrative modeling, we find that Ino80INS binds asymmetrically along the dodecamerization interface, resulting in a conformationally flexible dodecamer that collapses into hexamers upon ATP addition. Our results demonstrate the chaperone-like potential of Rvb1/Rvb2 and suggest a model where binding of multiple clients such as Ino80 stimulates ATP-driven cycling between hexamers and dodecamers, providing iterative opportunities for correct subunit assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Mutant KRAS and c-MYC are oncogenic drivers and rational therapeutic targets for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Although tumor growth and homeostasis are largely dependent on these oncogenes, a few residual cancer cells are able to survive the ablation of mutant KRAS and c-MYC. By performing a genome-wide gene expression analysis of in vivo-derived bulk tumor cells and residual cancer cells lacking the expression of mutant KRAS or c-MYC, we have identified an increase in autocrine IGF1/AKT signaling as a common survival mechanism in dormant cancer cells. The pharmacological inhibition of IGF-1R reduces residual disease burden and cancer recurrence, suggesting that this molecular pathway is crucial for the survival of cancer cells in the absence of the primary oncogenic drivers.

Abstract: Summary
Defining the genes that are essential for cellular proliferation is critical for understanding organismal development and identifying high-value targets for disease therapies. However, the requirements for cell-cycle progression in human cells remain incompletely understood. To elucidate the consequences of acute and chronic elimination of cell-cycle proteins, we generated and characterized inducible CRISPR/Cas9 knockout human cell lines targeting 209 genes involved in diverse cell-cycle processes. We performed single-cell microscopic analyses to systematically establish the effects of the knockouts on subcellular architecture. To define variations in cell-cycle requirements between cultured cell lines, we generated knockouts across cell lines of diverse origins. We demonstrate that p53 modulates the phenotype of specific cell-cycle defects through distinct mechanisms, depending on the defect. This work provides a resource to broadly facilitate robust and long-term depletion of cell-cycle proteins and reveals insights into the requirements for cell-cycle progression.

Abstract: Ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73) generates adenosine, an osteoblast activator and key regulator of skeletal growth. It is unknown, however, if CD73 regulates osteogenic differentiation during fracture healing in adulthood, and in particular how CD73 activity regulates intramembranous bone repair in the elderly. Monocortical tibial defects were created in 46–52-week-old wild type (WT) and CD73 knock-out mice (CD73−/−) mice. Injury repair was analyzed at post-operative days 5, 7, 14 and 21 by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), histomorphometry, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) histochemistry. Middle-aged CD73 knock-out mice exhibited delayed bone regeneration and significantly reduced bone matrix deposition detected by histomorphometry and micro-CT. Cell proliferation, ALP activity and osteoclast number were reduced in the CD73−/− mice, suggesting a combined defect in bone formation and resorption due the absence of CD73 activity in this model of intramembranous bone repair. Results from this study demonstrate that osteoblast activation through CD73 activity is essential during bone repair in aging mice, and it may present a drugable target for future biomimetic therapeutic approaches that aim at enhancing bone formation in the elderly patients.

Abstract: Summary
Cells convert excess energy into neutral lipids that are made in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bilayer. The lipids are then packaged into spherical or budded lipid droplets (LDs) covered by a phospholipid monolayer containing proteins. LDs play a key role in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis. A key unanswered question in the life of LDs is how they bud off from the ER. Here, we tackle this question by studying the budding of artificial LDs from model membranes. We find that the bilayer phospholipid composition and surface tension are key parameters of LD budding. Phospholipids have differential LD budding aptitudes, and those inducing budding decrease the bilayer tension. We observe that decreasing tension favors the egress of neutral lipids from the bilayer and LD budding. In cells, budding conditions favor the formation of small LDs. Our discovery reveals the importance of altering ER physical chemistry for controlled cellular LD formation.
