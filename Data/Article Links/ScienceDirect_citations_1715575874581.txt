Abstract: Summary
Neural circuits function in the face of changing inputs, either caused by normal variation in stimuli or by cell death. To maintain their ability to perform essential computations with partial inputs, neural circuits make modifications. Here, we study the retinal circuit's responses to changes in light stimuli or in photoreceptor inputs by inducing partial cone death in the mature mouse retina. Can the retina withstand or recover from input loss? We find that the excitatory pathways exhibit functional loss commensurate with cone death and with some aspects predicted by partial light stimulation. However, inhibitory pathways recover functionally from lost input by increasing spatiotemporal integration in a way that is not recapitulated by partially stimulating the control retina. Anatomically, inhibitory synapses are upregulated on secondary bipolar cells and output ganglion cells. These findings demonstrate the greater capacity for inhibition, compared with excitation, to modify spatiotemporal processing with fewer cone inputs.

Abstract: The new modalities for treating patients with high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (HGNMIBC) for whom Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has failed or is contraindicated are recently increasing due to the development of new drugs. Since NMIBC is sensitive to immunotherapy, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) agonist compounds may represent a potential antitumor therapeutic approach. Our research group developed a synthetic compound, with antitumor and immunological properties, called OncoTherad® (MRB-CFI-1). To evaluate the effects of OncoTherad® (MRB-CFI-1) and its compounds (P14−16 and CFI-1), thirty-six female C57Bl/6 J mice were divided into six groups (n = 6): Control, Cancer, Cancer + BCG (40 mg), Cancer + OncoTherad® (20 mg/mL), Cancer + P14−16 (20 mg/mL) and Cancer + CFI-1 (20 mg/mL). NMIBC was chemically induced (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea 50 mg/mL) and the treatments were followed for six weeks. The bladder was collected and routinely processed for immunohistochemical analyses of the Toll-Like receptors signaling pathway (TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, IRF-3, IKK-α, NF-kB, TNF-α, TRIF, IFN-γ, IL-6). The results obtained showed that the tumor progression was 100 % reduced on OncoTherad® (MRB-CFI-1) treated animals. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that while the conventional BCG treatment stimulated the canonic pathway, OncoTherad® (MRB-CFI-1) stimulated the non-canonical pathway (increasing expression of TLR4, TRIF, IRF, and IFNγ). OncoTherad® (MRB-CFI-1) could be considered a promising therapy in the treatment of NMIBC.

Abstract: Summary
Rhinovirus (RV) infection of the bronchial epithelium is implicated in the vast majority of severe asthma exacerbations. Interestingly, the susceptibility of bronchial epithelium to RV infection is increased in persons with asthma. Bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) remodeling is an important feature of severe asthma pathophysiology, and its reduction using bronchial thermoplasty has been associated with a significant decrease in the exacerbation rate. We hypothesized that asthmatic BSM can play a role in RV infection of the bronchial epithelium. Using an original co-culture model between bronchial epithelium and BSM cells, we show that asthmatic BSM cells increase RV replication in bronchial epithelium following RV infection. These findings are related to the increased production of CCL20 by asthmatic BSM cells. Moreover, we demonstrate an original downregulation of the activity of the epithelial protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) antiviral pathway. Finally, we identify a direct bottom-up effect of asthmatic BSM cells on bronchial epithelium susceptibility to RV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory stimuli have long been thought to be represented in the brain as activity patterns of specific neuronal assemblies. However, we still know relatively little about the long-term dynamics of sensory representations. Using chronic in vivo calcium imaging in the mouse auditory cortex, we find that sensory representations undergo continuous recombination, even under behaviorally stable conditions. Auditory cued fear conditioning introduces a bias into these ongoing dynamics, resulting in a long-lasting increase in the number of stimuli activating the same subset of neurons. This plasticity is specific for stimuli sharing representational similarity to the conditioned sound prior to conditioning and predicts behaviorally observed stimulus generalization. Our findings demonstrate that learning-induced plasticity leading to a representational linkage between the conditioned stimulus and non-conditioned stimuli weaves into ongoing dynamics of the brain rather than acting on an otherwise static substrate.

Abstract: Summary
Disruption of retromer-dependent endosomal trafficking is considered pathogenic in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, to investigate this disruption in the intact brain, we turn to a genetic mouse model where the retromer core protein VPS35 is depleted in hippocampal neurons, and then we replete VPS35 using an optimized viral vector protocol. The VPS35 depletion-repletion studies strengthen the causal link between the neuronal retromer and AD-associated neuronal phenotypes, including the acceleration of amyloid precursor protein cleavage and the loss of synaptic glutamate receptors. Moreover, the studies show that the neuronal retromer can regulate a distinct, dystrophic, microglia morphology, phenotypic of hippocampal microglia in AD. Finally, the neuronal and, in part, the microglia responses to VPS35 depletion were found to occur independent of tau. Showing that the neuronal retromer can regulate AD-associated pathologies in two of AD's principal cell types strengthens the link, and clarifies the mechanism, between endosomal trafficking and late-onset sporadic AD.

Abstract: Summary
Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-borne pathogen for which humans are an incidental host. POWV infection can be fatal or result in long-term neurological sequelae; however, there are no approved vaccinations for POWV. Integral to efficacious vaccine development is the identification of correlates of protection, which we accomplished in this study by utilizing a murine model of POWV infection. Using POWV lethal and sub-lethal challenge models, we show that (1) robust B and T cell responses are necessary for immune protection, (2) POWV lethality can be attributed to both viral- and host-mediated drivers of disease, and (3) knowledge of the immune correlates of protection against POWV can be applied in a virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccination approach that provides protection from lethal POWV challenge. Identification of these immune protection factors is significant as it will aid in the rational design of POWV vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
A neuron’s ability to perform parallel computations throughout its dendritic arbor substantially improves its computational capacity. However, during natural patterns of activity, the degree to which computations remain compartmentalized, especially in neurons with active dendritic trees, is not clear. Here, we examine how the direction of moving objects is computed across the bistratified dendritic arbors of ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) in the mouse retina. We find that although local synaptic signals propagate efficiently throughout their dendritic trees, direction-selective computations in one part of the dendritic arbor have little effect on those being made elsewhere. Independent dendritic processing allows DSGCs to compute the direction of moving objects multiple times as they traverse their receptive fields, enabling them to rapidly detect changes in motion direction on a sub-receptive-field basis. These results demonstrate that the parallel processing capacity of neurons can be maintained even during periods of intense synaptic activity.

Abstract: Summary
Decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli during sleep is presumably mediated via thalamic gating. Without an obligatory thalamic relay in the olfactory system, the anterior piriform cortex (APC) is suggested to be a gate in anesthetized states. However, olfactory processing in natural sleep states remains undetermined. Here, we simultaneously record local field potentials (LFPs) in hierarchical olfactory regions (olfactory bulb [OB], APC, and orbitofrontal cortex) while optogenetically activating olfactory sensory neurons, ensuring consistent peripheral inputs across states in behaving mice. Surprisingly, evoked LFPs in sleep states (both non-rapid eye movement [NREM] and rapid eye movement [REM]) are larger and contain greater gamma-band power and cross-region coherence (compared to wakefulness) throughout the olfactory pathway, suggesting the lack of a central gate. Single-unit recordings from the OB and APC reveal a higher percentage of responsive neurons during sleep with a higher incidence of suppressed firing. Additionally, nasal breathing is slower and shallower during sleep, suggesting a partial peripheral gating mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is the central driver of prostate cancer across disease states. While androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is effective in the initial treatment of prostate cancer, resistance to ADT or to next-generation androgen pathway inhibitors invariably arises, most commonly through the re-activation of the AR axis. Thus, orthogonal approaches to inhibit AR signaling in advanced prostate cancer are essential. Here, via genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identify protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) as a critical mediator of AR expression and signaling. PRMT1 regulates the recruitment of AR to genomic target sites and the inhibition of PRMT1 impairs AR binding at lineage-specific enhancers, leading to decreased expression of key oncogenes, including AR itself. In addition, AR-driven prostate cancer cells are uniquely susceptible to combined AR and PRMT1 inhibition. Our findings implicate PRMT1 as a key regulator of AR output and provide a preclinical framework for co-targeting of AR and PRMT1 in advanced prostate cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) are organelles of cellular lipid storage with fundamental roles in energy metabolism and cell membrane homeostasis. There has been an explosion of research into the biology of LDs, in part due to their relevance in diseases of lipid storage, such as atherosclerosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hepatic steatosis. Consequently, there is an increasing need for a resource that combines datasets from systematic analyses of LD biology. Here, we integrate high-confidence, systematically generated human, mouse, and fly data from studies on LDs in the framework of an online platform named the “Lipid Droplet Knowledge Portal” (https://lipiddroplet.org/). This scalable and interactive portal includes comprehensive datasets, across a variety of cell types, for LD biology, including transcriptional profiles of induced lipid storage, organellar proteomics, genome-wide screen phenotypes, and ties to human genetics. This resource is a powerful platform that can be utilized to identify determinants of lipid storage.

Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) pose a serious health burden to society and healthcare systems alike, with increasing incidence rates especially within aging populations. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of ND or dementia, followed by Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Progressive neurological dysfunction and regional neuronal loss constitute the common characteristics of ND. Many ND are accompanied by accumulation of protein aggregates such as extracellular amyloid-β (in AD), intraneuronal hyper-phosphorylated tau (in AD), or α-synuclein (in PD). Two main systems are responsible for the clearance of damaged, dysfunctional or senescent proteins inside cells: the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The importance of lysosomes in neurodegenerative processes is further highlighted by clinical phenotypes of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), comprising more than 70 inheritable diseases caused by mutations in lysosomal enzymes or lysosomal membrane proteins, often resulting in severe neurodegeneration. Dysfunctional lysosomal proteins and enzymes result in the lysosomal accumulation of undigested macromolecules, e.g. lipids, glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans, or gangliosides. Defects in intracellular transport pathways involving endosomes and lysosomes are increasingly recognized as drivers of neurodegenerative disease pathology including AD and PD. Thus, accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles (e.g. mitochondria) in neurons and glial cells overwhelms the capacity of intracellular recycling and degradation mechanisms, exacerbating disease pathology. Endolysosomal ion channels have recently been established as important regulators of lysosomal exocytosis, ion homeostasis/pH, endolysosomal trafficking, fusion and fission, and autophagy. In particular two non-selective endolysosomal cation channel families, the mucolipin/TRPML/MCOLN channels and the two-pore channels/TPCs will be discussed here as potential pharmacological targets for LSD/ND treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Cells live in constantly changing environments and employ dynamic signaling pathways to transduce information about the signals they encounter. However, the mechanisms by which dynamic signals are decoded into appropriate gene expression patterns remain poorly understood. Here, we devise networked optogenetic pathways that achieve dynamic signal processing functions that recapitulate cellular information processing. Exploiting light-responsive transcriptional regulators with differing response kinetics, we build a falling edge pulse detector and show that this circuit can be employed to demultiplex dynamically encoded signals. We combine this demultiplexer with dCas9-based gene networks to construct pulsatile signal filters and decoders. Applying information theory, we show that dynamic multiplexing significantly increases the information transmission capacity from signal to gene expression state. Finally, we use dynamic multiplexing for precise multidimensional regulation of a heterologous metabolic pathway. Our results elucidate design principles of dynamic information processing and provide original synthetic systems capable of decoding complex signals for biotechnological applications.

Abstract: Summary
Although the neurogenesis-enhancing effects of exercise have been extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms underlying this response remain unclear. Here, we propose that this is mediated by the exercise-induced systemic release of the antioxidant selenium transport protein, selenoprotein P (SEPP1). Using knockout mouse models, we confirmed that SEPP1 and its receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8) are required for the exercise-induced increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In vivo selenium infusion increased hippocampal neural precursor cell (NPC) proliferation and adult neurogenesis. Mimicking the effect of exercise through dietary selenium supplementation restored neurogenesis and reversed the cognitive decline associated with aging and hippocampal injury, suggesting potential therapeutic relevance. These results provide a molecular mechanism linking exercise-induced changes in the systemic environment to the activation of quiescent hippocampal NPCs and their subsequent recruitment into the neurogenic trajectory.

Abstract: Summary
Gut microbes play important roles in host physiology; however, the mechanisms underlying their impact remain poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that microbes not only influence gut physiology but also alter its epithelial composition. The microbiota and pathogens both influence intestinal stem cell (ISC) differentiation. Intriguingly, while the microbiota promotes ISC differentiation into enterocytes (EC), pathogens stimulate enteroendocrine cell (EE) fate and long-term accumulation of EEs in the midgut epithelium. Importantly, the evolutionarily conserved Drosophila NFKB (Relish) pushes stem cell lineage specification toward ECs by directly regulating differentiation factors. Conversely, the JAK-STAT pathway promotes EE fate in response to infectious damage. We propose a model in which the balance of microbial pattern recognition pathways, such as Imd-Relish, and damage response pathways, such as JAK-STAT, influence ISC differentiation, epithelial composition, and gut physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Although circular RNAs (circRNAs) are enriched in the brain, their relevance for brain function and psychiatric disorders is poorly understood. Here, we show that circHomer1 is inversely associated with relative HOMER1B mRNA isoform levels in both the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and stem-cell-derived neuronal cultures of subjects with psychiatric disorders. We further demonstrate that in vivo circHomer1 knockdown (KD) within the OFC can inhibit the synaptic expression of Homer1b mRNA. Furthermore, we show that circHomer1 directly binds to Homer1b mRNA and that Homer1b-specific KD increases synaptic circHomer1 levels and improves OFC-mediated behavioral flexibility. Importantly, double circHomer1 and Homer1b in vivo co-KD results in a complete rescue in circHomer1-associated alterations in both chance reversal learning and synaptic gene expression. Lastly, we uncover an RNA-binding protein that can directly bind to circHomer1 and promote its biogenesis. Taken together, our data provide mechanistic insights into the importance of circRNAs in brain function and disease.

Abstract: Calcium takes part in numerous cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, or cell death and plays a particular role in myogenesis of skeletal muscle. Indeed, intracellular calcium signaling participates, in a non-negligeable manner, to the “on” signal of muscle differentiation from undifferentiated cells to differentiated myotubes. Therefore, this differentiation can be modulated by controlling calcium activity with electrical or optogenetic stimulation approaches. In this study, we used the optogenetic tool channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) to control calcium activity and to modulate skeletal muscle differentiation. Using primary cultures of mouse myotubes, we showed that ChR2 stimulation was well-adapted to control intracellular calcium activity at the single cell or whole culture scale. To modulate the calcium-dependent myotube differentiation, we used an optical stimulation protocol based on GCAMP6s-decoded spontaneous calcium activity patterns of differentiated myotubes. The optical training of myotubes increased the fusion index and their contractile ability. This study demonstrates that handling a mature calcium signature with such optogenetic tool improves the differentiation of primary murine myotubes.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is co-transcriptionally deposited on mRNA, but a possible role of m6A on transcription remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the METTL3/METTL14/WTAP m6A methyltransferase complex (MTC) is localized to many promoters and enhancers and deposits the m6A modification on nascent transcripts, including pre-mRNAs, promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), and enhancer RNAs. PRO-seq analyses demonstrate that nascent RNAs originating from both promoters and enhancers are significantly decreased in the METTL3-depleted cells. Furthermore, genes targeted by the Integrator complex for premature termination are depleted of METTL3, suggesting a potential antagonistic relationship between METTL3 and Integrator. Consistently, we found the Integrator complex component INTS11 elevated at promoters and enhancers upon loss of MTC or nuclear m6A binders. Taken together, our findings suggest that MTC-mediated m6A modification protects nascent RNAs from Integrator-mediated termination and promotes productive transcription, thus unraveling an unexpected layer of gene regulation imposed by RNA m6A modification.

Abstract: Summary
Human cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection have been documented throughout the pandemic, but are likely under-reported. In the current study, we use the Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model to assess reinfection with homologous WA1 and heterologous B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 (Beta) SARS-CoV-2 variants over time. Upon primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 WA1, hamsters rapidly develop a strong and long-lasting humoral immune response. After reinfection with homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants, this immune response protects hamsters from clinical disease, virus replication in the lower respiratory tract, and acute lung pathology. However, reinfection leads to SARS-CoV-2 replication in the upper respiratory tract with the potential for virus shedding. Our findings indicate that reinfection results in restricted SARS-CoV-2 replication despite substantial levels of humoral immunity, denoting the potential for transmission through reinfected asymptomatic individuals.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis is facilitated and regulated by numerous ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs). High-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps have defined the molecular interactions of RBFs during maturation, but many transient and dynamic interactions, particularly during early assembly, remain uncharacterized. Using quantitative proteomics and crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry (XL-MS) data from an extensive set of pre-ribosomal particles, we derive a comprehensive and time-resolved interaction map of RBF engagement during 60S maturation. We localize 22 previously unmapped RBFs to specific biogenesis intermediates and validate our results by mapping the catalytic activity of the methyltransferases Bmt2 and Rcm1 to their predicted nucleolar 60S intermediates. Our analysis reveals the interaction sites for the RBFs Noc2 and Ecm1 and elucidates the interaction map and timing of 60S engagement by the DEAD-box ATPases Dbp9 and Dbp10. Our data provide a powerful resource for future studies of 60S ribosome biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
By establishing multi-omics pipelines, we uncover overexpression and gene copy-number alterations of nucleoporin-93 (NUP93), a nuclear pore component, in aggressive human mammary tumors. NUP93 overexpression enhances transendothelial migration and matrix invasion in vitro, along with tumor growth and metastasis in animal models. These findings are supported by analyses of two sets of naturally occurring mutations: rare oncogenic mutations and inactivating familial nephrotic syndrome mutations. Mechanistically, NUP93 binds with importins, boosts nuclear transport of importins' cargoes, such as β-catenin, and activates MYC. Likewise, NUP93 overexpression enhances the ultimate nuclear transport step shared by additional signaling pathways, including TGF-β/SMAD and EGF/ERK. The emerging addiction to nuclear transport exposes vulnerabilities of NUP93-overexpressing tumors. Congruently, myristoylated peptides corresponding to the nuclear translocation signals of SMAD and ERK can inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Our study sheds light on an emerging hallmark of advanced tumors, which derive benefit from robust nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Abstract: Summary
In high-throughput functional genomic screens, each gene product is commonly assumed to exhibit a singular biological function within a defined protein complex or pathway. In practice, a single gene perturbation may induce multiple cascading functional outcomes, a genetic principle known as pleiotropy. Here, we model pleiotropy in fitness screen collections by representing each gene perturbation as the sum of multiple perturbations of biological functions, each harboring independent fitness effects inferred empirically from the data. Our approach (Webster) recovered pleiotropic functions for DNA damage proteins from genotoxic fitness screens, untangled distinct signaling pathways upstream of shared effector proteins from cancer cell fitness screens, and predicted the stoichiometry of an unknown protein complex subunit from fitness data alone. Modeling compound sensitivity profiles in terms of genetic functions recovered compound mechanisms of action. Our approach establishes a sparse approximation mechanism for unraveling complex genetic architectures underlying high-dimensional gene perturbation readouts.

Abstract: Summary
The balance of programmed death-1 (PD-1)-expressing CD8+ T cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) determines the clinical efficacy of PD-1 blockade therapy through the competition of their reactivation. However, factors that determine this balance remain unknown. Here, we show that Treg cells gain higher PD-1 expression than effector T cells in highly glycolytic tumors, including MYC-amplified tumors and liver tumors. Under low-glucose environments via glucose consumption by tumor cells, Treg cells actively absorbed lactic acid (LA) through monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), promoting NFAT1 translocation into the nucleus, thereby enhancing the expression of PD-1, whereas PD-1 expression by effector T cells was dampened. PD-1 blockade invigorated the PD-1-expressing Treg cells, resulting in treatment failure. We propose that LA in the highly glycolytic TME is an active checkpoint for the function of Treg cells in the TME via upregulation of PD-1 expression.

Abstract: Summary
We previously used single-cell transcriptomic analysis to characterize human fetal retinal development and assessed the degree to which retinal organoids recapitulate normal development. We now extend the transcriptomic analyses to incorporate single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq), a powerful method used to characterize potential gene regulatory networks through the changes in accessible chromatin that accompany cell-state changes. The combination of scATAC-seq and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a view of developing human retina at an unprecedented resolution. We identify key transcription factors relevant to specific fates and the order of the transcription factor cascades that define each of the major retinal cell types. The changing chromatin landscape is largely recapitulated in retinal organoids; however, there are differences in Notch signaling and amacrine cell gene regulation. The datasets we generated constitute an excellent resource for the continued improvement of retinal organoid technology and have the potential to inform and accelerate regenerative medicine approaches to retinal diseases.

Abstract: Summary
A compact protein with a size of <1,000 amino acids, the CRISPR-associated protein CasX is a fundamentally distinct RNA-guided nuclease when compared to Cas9 and Cas12a. Although it can induce RNA-guided genome editing in mammalian cells, the activity of CasX is less robust than that of the widely used S. pyogenes Cas9. Here, we show that structural features of two CasX homologs and their guide RNAs affect the R-loop complex assembly and DNA cleavage activity. Cryo-EM-based structural engineering of either the CasX protein or the guide RNA produced two new CasX genome editors (DpbCasX-R3-v2 and PlmCasX-R1-v2) with significantly improved DNA manipulation efficacy. These results advance both the mechanistic understanding of CasX and its application as a genome-editing tool.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can self-renew indefinitely or can be induced to differentiate. We previously showed that exogenous glutamine (Gln) withdrawal biased hPSC differentiation toward ectoderm and away from mesoderm. We revealed that, although all three germ lineages are capable of de novo Gln synthesis, only ectoderm generates sufficient Gln to sustain cell viability and differentiation, and this finding clarifies lineage fate restrictions under Gln withdrawal. Furthermore, we found that Gln acts as a signaling molecule for ectoderm that supersedes lineage-specifying cytokine induction. In contrast, Gln in mesoderm and endoderm is the preferred precursor of α-ketoglutarate without a direct signaling role. Our work raises a question about whether the nutrient environment functions directly in cell differentiation during development. Interestingly, transcriptome analysis of a gastrulation-stage human embryo shows that unique Gln enzyme-encoding gene expression patterns may also distinguish germ lineages in vivo. Together, our study suggests that intracellular Gln may help coordinate differentiation of the three germ layers.

Abstract: This study evaluated the effects of combined OncoTherad immunotherapy and probiotic supplementation on colorectal carcinogenesis chemically induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) in mice. The animals were randomly allocated in five groups: Control, DMH: did not receive any treatment; DMH + OncoTherad: received weekly I.P. (intraperitoneal) dose of OncoTherad; DMH + Probiotic: received daily administrations via gavage of the functional food (Lactobacillus: acidophilus and paracasei, Bifidobacterium: lactis and bifidum) and DMH + Probiotic + OncoTherad: received the same treatment than the previous groups. After ten weeks of treatment, the large intestine was collected for immunohistochemical analysis of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, IL-6, TLR2, TRIF, IRF-3, IFN-γ, Ki-67, KRAS, IL-10, and TGF-β. For the statistical analysis, the variance tests (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis were used and significance set at p < 0.05. Probiotic supplementation associated with the OncoTherad were able to modulate weight loss, stimulate the canonical signaling pathway TLR2/TLR4 (MyD88-dependent), reduce the non-canonical signaling pathway (TRIF-dependent), attenuate the proliferative pathway mediated by Ki-67 and KRAS oncogene, and stimulate the production of IL-10 and TGF-β cytokines. Thus, the association of OncoTherad and probiotic supplementation has shown important immudomulatory effects and could be considered a potential new therapeutic approach for colorectal cancer after further investigations.

Abstract: Summary
A major goal in synthetic biology is coordinating cellular behavior using cell-cell interactions; however, designing and testing complex genetic circuits that function only in large populations remains challenging. Although directed evolution has commonly supplemented rational design methods for synthetic gene circuits, this method relies on the efficient screening of mutant libraries for desired phenotypes. Recently, multiple techniques have been developed for identifying dynamic phenotypes from large, pooled libraries. These technologies have advanced library screening for single-cell, time-varying phenotypes but are currently incompatible with population-level phenotypes dependent on cell-cell communication. Here, we utilize directed mutagenesis and multiplexed microfluidics to develop an arrayed-screening workflow for dynamic, population-level genetic circuits. Specifically, we create a mutant library of an existing oscillator, the synchronized lysis circuit, and discover variants with different period-amplitude characteristics. Lastly, we utilize our screening workflow to construct a transcriptionally regulated synchronized oscillator that functions over long timescales. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport is critical to protein secretion and intracellular sorting. Here, we report a highly elongated tubular ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (t-ERGIC) that selectively expedites the ER-to-Golgi transport for soluble cargoes of the receptor SURF4. Lacking the canonical ERGIC marker ERGIC-53 yet positive for the small GTPases Rab1A/B, the t-ERGIC is further marked by its extraordinarily elongated and thinned shape. With its large surface-to-volume ratio, high intracellular traveling speeds, and ER-Golgi recycling capabilities, the t-ERGIC accelerates the trafficking of SURF4-bound cargoes. The biogenesis and cargo selectivity of t-ERGIC both depend on SURF4, which recognizes the N terminus of soluble cargoes and co-clusters with the selected cargoes to expand the ER-exit site. In the steady state, the t-ERGIC-mediated fast ER-to-Golgi transport is antagonized by the KDEL-mediated ER retrieval. Together, our results argue that specific cargo-receptor interactions give rise to distinct transport carriers that regulate the trafficking kinetics.

Abstract: Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a systemic disease that may cause severe metabolic complications in multiple tissues including liver, kidney, and cardiovascular system. However, the underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment remain elusive. Our study shows that impairment of ACE2 pathway is a key factor linking virus infection to its secondary metabolic sequelae. By using structure-based high-throughput virtual screening and connectivity map database, followed with experimental validations, we identify imatinib, methazolamide, and harpagoside as direct enzymatic activators of ACE2. Imatinib and methazolamide remarkably improve metabolic perturbations in vivo in an ACE2-dependent manner under the insulin-resistant state and SARS-CoV-2-infected state. Moreover, viral entry is directly inhibited by these three compounds due to allosteric inhibition of ACE2 binding to spike protein on SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, our study shows that enzymatic activation of ACE2 via imatinib, methazolamide, or harpagoside may be a conceptually new strategy to treat metabolic sequelae of COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
B-1 cell development mainly occurs via fetal and neonatal hematopoiesis and is suppressed in adult bone marrow hematopoiesis. However, little is known about the factors inhibiting B-1 cell development at the adult stage. We report that capicua (CIC) suppresses postnatal B-1a cell development and survival. CIC levels are high in B-1a cells and gradually increase in transitional B-1a (TrB-1a) cells with age. B-cell-specific Cic-null mice exhibit expansion of the B-1a cell population and a gradual increase in TrB-1a cell frequency with age but attenuated B-2 cell development. CIC deficiency enhances B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in transitional B cells and B-1a cell viability. Mechanistically, CIC-deficiency-mediated Per2 derepression upregulates Bhlhe41 levels by inhibiting CRY-mediated transcriptional repression for Bhlhe41, consequently promoting B-1a cell formation in Cic-null mice. Taken together, CIC is a key transcription factor that limits the B-1a cell population at the adult stage and balances B-1 versus B-2 cell formation.

Abstract: Summary
mTORC1 controls cellular metabolic processes in response to nutrient availability. Amino acid signals are transmitted to mTORC1 through the Rag GTPases, which are localized on the lysosomal surface by the Ragulator complex. The Rag GTPases receive amino acid signals from multiple upstream regulators. One negative regulator, GATOR1, is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for RagA. GATOR1 binds to the Rag GTPases via two modes: an inhibitory mode and a GAP mode. How these two binding interactions coordinate to process amino acid signals is unknown. Here, we resolved three cryo-EM structural models of the GATOR1-Rag-Ragulator complex, with the Rag-Ragulator subcomplex occupying the inhibitory site, the GAP site, and both binding sites simultaneously. When the Rag GTPases bind to GATOR1 at the GAP site, both Rag subunits contact GATOR1 to coordinate their nucleotide loading states. These results reveal a potential GAP mechanism of GATOR1 during the mTORC1 inactivation process.

Abstract: Summary
Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) is an RNA-like polymer that regulates an increasing number of biological processes. Dysregulation of PAR is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal protein aggregation, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). PAR forms condensates with FUS, an RNA-binding protein linked with ALS, through an unknown mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that a strikingly low concentration of PAR (1 nM) is sufficient to trigger condensation of FUS near its physiological concentration (1 μM), which is three orders of magnitude lower than the concentration at which RNA induces condensation (1 μM). Unlike RNA, which associates with FUS stably, PAR interacts with FUS transiently, triggering FUS to oligomerize into condensates. Moreover, inhibition of a major PAR-synthesizing enzyme, PARP5a, diminishes FUS condensation in cells. Despite their structural similarity, PAR and RNA co-condense with FUS, driven by disparate modes of interaction with FUS. Thus, we uncover a mechanism by which PAR potently seeds FUS condensation.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor physical microenvironment contributes greatly to the response of tumor cells. However, the mechanism of how extracellular substrate rigidity remodels colorectal cancer (CRC) cell fate and affects CRC progression remains elusive. Here, we show that F-actin regulator KIAA1211, also known as Capping protein inhibiting regulator of actin dynamics (CRAD), negatively correlates with CRC progression, stemness, and metastasis. Mechanistically, decreased CRAD in soft substrates induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) retention in the cytoplasm, restoring the repression effect on stemness markers NANOG and OCT4, thereby promoting CRC stemness and metastasis. Furthermore, CRAD deficiency promotes colorectal tumor cell softening and regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) states, contributing to its metastasis potential. Clinically, CRAD expression is correlated with malignant degrees and metastasis in CRC patients. Our work uncovers a role of CRAD in anticancer and mechanical signal transduction of the extracellular matrix in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), the overexpression of which reduces survivability of cancer patients, is essential for cell migration and metastasis. However, the intracellular signaling pathways involved are largely unknown. Here, we report that PGRMC1 promotes store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) as a functional interactor of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). PGRMC1 was repeatedly detected as an interactor of STIM1-Orai1 complex via complementation-dependent in situ labeling. Genetic depletion of PGRMC1 decreased SOCE and impaired activation of the nuclear factor of the activated T cell (NFAT) pathway. Mechanistically, PGRMC1 directly bound to the coiled-coil domain of STIM1, promoting STIM1 conformational switch. In breast cancer cells, PGRMC1 depletion reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced SOCE and disrupted focal adhesion turnover and actomyosin formation. These findings identify PGRMC1 as an essential regulator of Ca2+ signaling in breast cancer cells, providing a target for treating cancer metastasis and an insight for dissecting various PGRMC1/SOCE-induced biological processes.

Abstract: Summary
The latency of spikes relative to a stimulus conveys sensory information across modalities. However, in most cases, it remains unclear whether and how such latency codes are utilized by postsynaptic neurons. In the active electrosensory system of mormyrid fish, a latency code for stimulus amplitude in electroreceptor afferent nerve fibers (EAs) is hypothesized to be read out by a central reference provided by motor corollary discharge (CD). Here, we demonstrate that CD enhances sensory responses in postsynaptic granular cells of the electrosensory lobe but is not required for reading out EA input. Instead, diverse latency and spike count tuning across the EA population give rise to graded information about stimulus amplitude that can be read out by standard integration of converging excitatory synaptic inputs. Inhibitory control over the temporal window of integration renders two granular cell subclasses differentially sensitive to information derived from relative spike latency versus spike count.

Abstract: Summary
Stresses such as heat shock trigger the formation of protein aggregates and the induction of a disaggregation system composed of molecular chaperones. Recent work reveals that several cases of apparent heat-induced aggregation, long thought to be the result of toxic misfolding, instead reflect evolved, adaptive biomolecular condensation, with chaperone activity contributing to condensate regulation. Here we show that the yeast disaggregation system directly disperses heat-induced biomolecular condensates of endogenous poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1) orders of magnitude more rapidly than aggregates of the most commonly used misfolded model substrate, firefly luciferase. Beyond its efficiency, heat-induced condensate dispersal differs from heat-induced aggregate dispersal in its molecular requirements and mechanistic behavior. Our work establishes a bona fide endogenous heat-induced substrate for long-studied heat shock proteins, isolates a specific example of chaperone regulation of condensates, and underscores needed expansion of the proteotoxic interpretation of the heat shock response to encompass adaptive, chaperone-mediated regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The non-classical Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHCII) protein, H2-M, edits peptides bound to conventional MHCII in favor of stable peptide/MHCII (p/MHCII) complexes. Here, we show that H2-M deficiency affects B-1 cell survival, reduces cell renewal capacity, and alters immunoglobulin repertoire, allowing for the selection of cells specific for highly abundant epitopes, but not low-frequency epitopes. H2-M-deficient B-1 cells have shorter CDR3 length, higher content of positively charged amino acids, shorter junctional regions, less mutation frequency, and a skewed clonal distribution. Mechanistically, H2-M loss reduces plasma membrane p/MHCII association with B cell receptors (BCR) on B-1 cells and diminishes integrated BCR signal strength, a key determinant of B-1 cell selection, maturation, and maintenance. Thus, H2-M:MHCII interaction serves as a cell-intrinsic regulator of BCR signaling and influences the selection of the B-1 cell clonal repertoire.

Abstract: Summary
Many lncRNAs have been discovered using transcriptomic data; however, it is unclear what fraction of lncRNAs is functional and what structural properties affect their phenotype. MUNC lncRNA (also known as DRReRNA) acts as an enhancer RNA for the Myod1 gene in cis and stimulates the expression of other promyogenic genes in trans by recruiting the cohesin complex. Here, experimental probing of the RNA structure revealed that MUNC contains multiple structural domains not detected by prediction algorithms in the absence of experimental information. We show that these specific and structurally distinct domains are required for induction of promyogenic genes, for binding genomic sites and gene expression regulation, and for binding the cohesin complex. Myod1 induction and cohesin interaction comprise only a subset of MUNC phenotype. Our study reveals unexpectedly complex, structure-driven functions for the MUNC lncRNA and emphasizes the importance of experimentally determined structures for understanding structure-function relationships in lncRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibitors of the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) signaling axis are approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, based on their significant overall survival (OS) benefit. Using transcriptomic analysis of 891 NSCLC tumors from patients treated with either the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab or chemotherapy from two large randomized clinical trials, we find a significant B cell association with extended OS with PD-L1 blockade, independent of CD8+ T cell signals. We then derive gene signatures corresponding to the dominant B cell subsets present in NSCLC from single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Importantly, we find increased plasma cell signatures to be predictive of OS in patients treated with atezolizumab, but not chemotherapy. B and plasma cells are also associated with the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures and organized lymphoid aggregates. Our results suggest an important contribution of B and plasma cells to the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade in NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical decisions in cancer rely on precisely assessing patient risk. To improve our ability to identify the most aggressive malignancies, we constructed genome-wide survival models using gene expression, copy number, methylation, and mutation data from 10,884 patients. We identified more than 100,000 significant prognostic biomarkers and demonstrate that these genomic features can predict patient outcomes in clinically ambiguous situations. While adverse biomarkers are commonly believed to represent cancer driver genes and promising therapeutic targets, we show that cancer features associated with shorter survival times are not enriched for either oncogenes or for successful drug targets. Instead, the strongest adverse biomarkers represent widely expressed cell-cycle and housekeeping genes, and, correspondingly, nearly all therapies directed against these features have failed in clinical trials. In total, our analysis establishes a rich resource for prognostic biomarker analysis and clarifies the use of patient survival data in preclinical cancer research and therapeutic development.

Abstract: Summary
The dually lipidated Sonic hedgehog (SHH) morphogen signals through the tumor suppressor membrane protein Patched1 (PTCH1) to activate the Hedgehog pathway, which is fundamental in development and cancer. SHH engagement with PTCH1 requires the GAS1 coreceptor, but the mechanism is unknown. We demonstrate a unique role for GAS1, catalyzing SHH–PTCH1 complex assembly in vertebrate cells by direct SHH transfer from the extracellular SCUBE2 carrier to PTCH1. Structure of the GAS1–SHH–PTCH1 transition state identifies how GAS1 recognizes the SHH palmitate and cholesterol modifications in modular fashion and how it facilitates lipid-dependent SHH handoff to PTCH1. Structure-guided experiments elucidate SHH movement from SCUBE2 to PTCH1, explain disease mutations, and demonstrate that SHH-induced PTCH1 dimerization causes its internalization from the cell surface. These results define how the signaling-competent SHH–PTCH1 complex assembles, the key step triggering the Hedgehog pathway, and provide a paradigm for understanding morphogen reception and its regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The increasing prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with the ability to escape existing humoral protection conferred by previous infection and/or immunization necessitates the discovery of broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Utilizing mRNA display, we identify a set of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins and characterize the structures of nAbs that recognize epitopes in the S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein. These structural studies reveal distinct binding modes for several antibodies, including the targeting of rare cryptic epitopes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S that interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate infection, as well as the S1 subdomain 1. Further, we engineer a potent ACE2-blocking nAb to sustain binding to S RBD with the E484K and L452R substitutions found in multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. We demonstrate that mRNA display is an approach for the rapid identification of nAbs that can be used in combination to combat emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Abstract: The cardiac Na+/Ca2+ Exchanger (NCX1) controls Ca2+ extrusion from the cytosol by mediating bidirectional exchange of Na+ for Ca2+, and therefore controls cardiac relaxation. Insulin regulates Ca2+ handling in cardiac tissue through NCX1, however how insulin changes NCX1 activity is poorly understood. Palmitoylation is the only post-translational modification identified to alter NCX1 activity. Here we show that insulin triggers local structural re-arrangements within existing NCX1 dimers by inducing their palmitoylation, thus tunes NCX1 inactivation through a zDHHC5-dependent mechanism in multiple cell types. By activating fatty acid and fatty acyl CoA synthesis insulin promotes palmitoylation of the zDHHC5 active site, which leads to enhanced NCX1 palmitoylation. Our findings represent a new mechanism to regulate the palmitoylation of numerous zDHHC5 substrates.

Abstract: Summary
CaMKII has long been known to be a key effector for synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have shown that a variety of modulators interact with the subunits of CaMKII to regulate the long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal neurons. However, whether long non-coding RNAs modulate the activity of CaMKII and affect synaptic plasticity is still elusive. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized long non-coding RNA Carip that functions as a scaffold, specifically interacts with CaMKIIβ, and regulates the phosphorylation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits in the hippocampus. The absence of Carip causes dysfunction of synaptic transmission and attenuates LTP in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses, which further leads to impairment of spatial learning and memory. In summary, our findings demonstrate that Carip modulates long-term synaptic plasticity by changing AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor activities, thereby affecting spatial learning and memory in mice.

Abstract: Summary
KRAS, which is mutated in ∼30% of all cancers, activates the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade. CRAF is required for growth of KRAS mutant lung tumors, but the requirement for CRAF kinase activity is unknown. Here, we show that subsets of KRAS mutant tumors are dependent on CRAF for growth. Kinase-dead but not dimer-defective CRAF rescues growth inhibition, suggesting that dimerization but not kinase activity is required. Quantitative proteomics demonstrates increased levels of CRAF:ARAF dimers in KRAS mutant cells, and depletion of both CRAF and ARAF rescues the CRAF-loss phenotype. Mechanistically, CRAF depletion causes sustained ERK activation and induction of cell-cycle arrest, while treatment with low-dose MEK or ERK inhibitor rescues the CRAF-loss phenotype. Our studies highlight the role of CRAF in regulating MAPK signal intensity to promote tumorigenesis downstream of mutant KRAS and suggest that disrupting CRAF dimerization or degrading CRAF may have therapeutic benefit.

Abstract: Summary
The demands of cancer cell proliferation alongside an inadequate angiogenic response lead to insufficient oxygen availability in the tumor microenvironment. Within the mitochondria, oxygen is the major electron acceptor for NADH, with the result that the reducing potential produced through tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity and mitochondrial respiration are functionally linked. As the oxidizing activity of the TCA cycle is required for efficient synthesis of anabolic precursors, tumoral hypoxia could lead to a cessation of proliferation without another means of correcting the redox imbalance. We show that in hypoxic conditions, mitochondrial pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) activity is increased, oxidizing NADH with the synthesis of proline as a by-product. We further show that PYCR1 activity is required for the successful maintenance of hypoxic regions by permitting continued TCA cycle activity, and that its loss leads to significantly increased hypoxia in vivo and in 3D culture, resulting in widespread cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cell intrinsic ferroptosis-initiating mechanisms are unknown. Here, we discover that T cell-derived interferon (IFN)γ in combination with arachidonic acid (AA) induces immunogenic tumor ferroptosis, serving as a mode of action for CD8+ T cell (CTL)-mediated tumor killing. Mechanistically, IFNγ stimulates ACSL4 and alters tumor cell lipid pattern, thereby increasing incorporations of AA into C16 and C18 acyl chain-containing phospholipids. Palmitoleic acid and oleic acid, two common C16 and C18 fatty acids in blood, promote ACSL4-dependent tumor ferroptosis induced by IFNγ plus AA. Moreover, tumor ACSL4 deficiency accelerates tumor progression. Low-dose AA enhances tumor ferroptosis and elevates spontaneous and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-induced anti-tumor immunity. Clinically, tumor ACSL4 correlates with T cell signatures and improved survival in ICB-treated cancer patients. Thus, IFNγ signaling paired with selective fatty acids is a natural tumor ferroptosis-promoting mechanism and a mode of action of CTLs. Targeting the ACSL4 pathway is a potential anti-cancer approach.

Abstract: Summary
Excessive generation and accumulation of highly reactive oxidizing molecules causes oxidative stress and oxidative damage to cellular components. Accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy diminishes oxidative damage in cells and maintains redox homeostasis by degrading and recycling intracellular damaged components. Here, we show that TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase and A20 deubiquitinase coordinate to regulate ATG9A ubiquitination and autophagy activation in cells responding to oxidative stress. The ROS-dependent TRAF6-mediated non-proteolytic, K48/63-linked ubiquitination of ATG9A enhances its association with Beclin 1 and the assembly of VPS34-UVRAG complex, thereby stimulating autophagy. Notably, expression of the ATG9A ubiquitination mutants impairs ROS-induced VPS34 activation and autophagy. We further find that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ROS production also stimulates TRAF6-mediated ATG9A ubiquitination. Ablation of ATG9A causes aberrant TLR4 endosomal trafficking and decreases IRF-3 phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Our findings provide important insights into how K48/K63-linked ubiquitination of ATG9A contributes to the regulation of oxidative stress-induced autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a critical role in the development and disease-states of all human cell types. In the retina, CREs have been implicated in several inherited disorders. To better characterize human retinal CREs, we performed single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on the developing and adult human retina and on induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal organoids. These analyses identified developmentally dynamic, cell-class-specific CREs, enriched transcription-factor-binding motifs, and putative target genes. CREs in the retina and organoids are highly correlated at the single-cell level, and this supports the use of organoids as a model for studying disease-associated CREs. As a proof of concept, we disrupted a disease-associated CRE at 5q14.3, confirming its principal target gene as the miR-9-2 primary transcript and demonstrating its role in neurogenesis and gene regulation in mature glia. This study provides a resource for characterizing human retinal CREs and showcases organoids as a model to study the function of CREs that influence development and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Fundamental to our understanding of chromosome duplication is the idea that replication origins function both as sites where MCM helicases are loaded during the G1 phase and where synthesis begins in S phase. However, the temporal delay between phases exposes the replisome assembly pathway to potential disruption prior to replication. Using multicolor, single-molecule imaging, we systematically study the consequences of encounters between actively transcribing RNA polymerases (RNAPs) and replication initiation intermediates in the context of chromatin. We demonstrate that RNAP can push multiple licensed MCM helicases over long distances with nucleosomes ejected or displaced. Unexpectedly, we observe that MCM helicase loading intermediates also can be repositioned by RNAP and continue origin licensing after encounters with RNAP, providing a web of alternative origin specification pathways. Taken together, our observations reveal a surprising mobility in origin-licensing factors that confers resistance to the complex challenges posed by diverse obstacles encountered on chromosomes.

Abstract: Purpose
Artesunate (ART) is recognized for its anticancer activity, but a few studies concentrate on its anti-skin cancer effect. This study emphazied this aspect and preliminarily discussed the impact and mechanism of ART on cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC).
Methods
The viability of HaCaT and CSCC cells treated with ART (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, or 210 μmol/L) for 48 h were assessed utilizing cell counting kit-8. Next, the migration, invasion, proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of CSCC cells treated with ART were evaluated by dint of cell function experiments. Then, cell cycle-, apoptosis-, and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway-related markers were examined via western blot or quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, the influences of ART and PI3K/AKT agonist IGF-I on CSCC cell biological behaviors were gauged again.
Results
The suppressive role of ART (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, or 210 μmol/L) was stronger in viability of CSCC cells than in viability of HaCaT cells. ART evidently attenuated the migration, invasion and proliferation, lessened cell numbers at G2/M phase and triggered apoptosis of CSCC cells. At the molecular level, ART regulated cell cycle-, apoptosis-, and PI3K/AKT pathway-related markers in CSCC cells. Moreover, the suppression of ART on CSCC cell malignant phenotypes was reversed by PI3K/AKT agonist IGF-I.
Conclusion
ART restrains the malignant progression of CSCC, which may be intensely related to the PI3K/AKT pathway repression.

Abstract: Summary
Folding of stringent clients requires transfer from Hsp70 to Hsp90. The co-chaperone Hop physically connects the chaperone machineries. Here, we define its role from the remodeling of Hsp70/40-client complexes to the mechanism of client transfer and the conformational switching from stalled to active client-processing states of Hsp90. We show that Hsp70 together with Hsp40 completely unfold a stringent client, the glucocorticoid receptor ligand-binding domain (GR-LBD) in large assemblies. Hop remodels these for efficient transfer onto Hsp90. As p23 enters, Hsp70 leaves the complex via switching between binding sites in Hop. Current concepts assume that to proceed to client folding, Hop dissociates and the co-chaperone p23 stabilizes the Hsp90 closed state. In contrast, we show that p23 functionally interacts with Hop, relieves the stalling Hsp90-Hop interaction, and closes Hsp90. This reaction allows folding of the client and is thus the key regulatory step for the progression of the chaperone cycle.

Abstract: Summary
The heat shock (HS) response involves rapid induction of HS genes, whereas transcriptional repression is established more slowly at most other genes. Previous data suggested that such repression results from inhibition of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) pause release, but here, we show that HS strongly affects other phases of the transcription cycle. Intriguingly, while elongation rates increase upon HS, processivity markedly decreases, so that RNAPII frequently fails to reach the end of genes. Indeed, HS results in widespread premature transcript termination at cryptic, intronic polyadenylation (IPA) sites near gene 5′-ends, likely via inhibition of U1 telescripting. This results in dramatic reconfiguration of the human transcriptome with production of new, previously unannotated, short mRNAs that accumulate in the nucleus. Together, these results shed new light on the basic transcription mechanisms induced by growth at elevated temperature and show that a genome-wide shift toward usage of IPA sites can occur under physiological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic evolution occurs over million-year timescales in Cryptococcus neoformans and is mediated by DNMT5, the first maintenance type cytosine methyltransferase identified in the fungal or protist kingdoms, the first dependent on adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the most hemimethyl-DNA-specific enzyme known. To understand these novel properties, we solved cryo-EM structures of CnDNMT5 in three states. These studies reveal an elaborate allosteric cascade in which hemimethylated DNA binding first activates the SNF2 ATPase domain by a large rigid body rotation while the target cytosine partially flips out of the DNA duplex. ATP binding then triggers striking structural reconfigurations of the methyltransferase catalytic pocket to enable cofactor binding, completion of base flipping, and catalysis. Bound unmethylated DNA does not open the catalytic pocket and is instead ejected upon ATP binding, driving high fidelity. This unprecedented chaperone-like, enzyme-remodeling role of the SNF2 ATPase domain illuminates how energy is used to enable faithful epigenetic memory.

Abstract: Summary
By combining 6 druggable genome resources, we identify 6,083 genes as potential druggable genes (PDGs). We characterize their expression, recurrent genomic alterations, cancer dependencies, and therapeutic potentials by integrating genome, functionome, and druggome profiles across cancers. 81.5% of PDGs are reliably expressed in major adult cancers, 46.9% show selective expression patterns, and 39.1% exhibit at least one recurrent genomic alteration. We annotate a total of 784 PDGs as dependent genes for cancer cell growth. We further quantify 16 cancer-related features and estimate a PDG cancer drug target score (PCDT score). PDGs with higher PCDT scores are significantly enriched for genes encoding kinases and histone modification enzymes. Importantly, we find that a considerable portion of high PCDT score PDGs are understudied genes, providing unexplored opportunities for drug development in oncology. By integrating the druggable genome and the cancer genome, our study thus generates a comprehensive blueprint of potential druggable genes across cancers.

Abstract: Summary
The Zic family of zinc finger transcription factors plays a critical role in multiple developmental processes. Using loss-of-function studies, we find that Zic5 is important for the differentiation of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and the rod photoreceptor layer through suppressing Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Further, Zic5 interacts with the critical Hh signaling molecule, Gli3, through the zinc finger domains of both proteins. This Zic5-Gli3 interaction disrupts Gli3/Gli3 homodimerization, resulting in Gli3 protein stabilization via a reduction in Gli3 ubiquitination. During embryonic Hh signaling, the activator form of Gli is normally converted to a repressor form through proteosome-mediated processing of Gli3, and the ratio of Gli3 repressor to full-length (activator) form of Gli3 determines the Gli3 repressor output required for normal eye development. Our results suggest Zic5 is a critical player in regulating Gli3 stability for the proper differentiation of RPE and rod photoreceptor layer during Xenopus eye development.

Abstract: Summary
A unifying feature of the RAS superfamily is a conserved GTPase cycle by which these proteins transition between active and inactive states. We demonstrate that autophosphorylation of some GTPases is an intrinsic regulatory mechanism that reduces nucleotide hydrolysis and enhances nucleotide exchange, altering the on/off switch that forms the basis for their signaling functions. Using X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, binding assays, and molecular dynamics on autophosphorylated mutants of H-RAS and K-RAS, we show that phosphoryl transfer from GTP requires dynamic movement of the switch II region and that autophosphorylation promotes nucleotide exchange by opening the active site and extracting the stabilizing Mg2+. Finally, we demonstrate that autophosphorylated K-RAS exhibits altered effector interactions, including a reduced affinity for RAF proteins in mammalian cells. Thus, autophosphorylation leads to altered active site dynamics and effector interaction properties, creating a pool of GTPases that are functionally distinct from their non-phosphorylated counterparts.

Abstract: Summary
PD-1 blockade exerts clinical efficacy against various types of cancer by reinvigorating T cells that directly attack tumor cells (tumor-specific T cells) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) also comprise nonspecific bystander T cells. Here, using single-cell sequencing, we show that TILs include skewed T cell clonotypes, which are characterized by exhaustion (Tex) or nonexhaustion signatures (Tnon-ex). Among skewed clonotypes, those in the Tex, but not those in the Tnon-ex, cluster respond to autologous tumor cell lines. After PD-1 blockade, non-preexisting tumor-specific clonotypes in the Tex cluster appear in the TME. Tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) without metastasis harbor a considerable number of such clonotypes, whereas these clonotypes are rarely detected in peripheral blood. We propose that tumor-infiltrating skewed T cell clonotypes with an exhausted phenotype directly attack tumor cells and that PD-1 blockade can promote infiltration of such Tex clonotypes, mainly from TDLNs.

Abstract: Summary
The MYC oncogene has been studied for decades, yet there is still intense debate over how this transcription factor controls gene expression. Here, we seek to answer these questions with an in vivo readout of discrete events of gene expression in single cells. We engineered an optogenetic variant of MYC (Pi-MYC) and combined this tool with single-molecule RNA and protein imaging techniques to investigate the role of MYC in modulating transcriptional bursting and transcription factor binding dynamics in human cells. We find that the immediate consequence of MYC overexpression is an increase in the duration rather than in the frequency of bursts, a functional role that is different from the majority of human transcription factors. We further propose that the mechanism by which MYC exerts global effects on the active period of genes is by altering the binding dynamics of transcription factors involved in RNA polymerase II complex assembly and productive elongation.

Abstract: Summary
The transition between quiescence and activation in neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) is coupled with reversible changes in energy metabolism with key implications for lifelong NSPC self-renewal and neurogenesis. How this metabolic plasticity is ensured between NSPC activity states is unclear. We find that a state-specific rewiring of the mitochondrial proteome by the i-AAA peptidase YME1L is required to preserve NSPC self-renewal. YME1L controls the abundance of numerous mitochondrial substrates in quiescent NSPCs, and its deletion activates a differentiation program characterized by broad metabolic changes causing the irreversible shift away from a fatty-acid-oxidation-dependent state. Conditional Yme1l deletion in adult NSPCs in vivo results in defective self-renewal and premature differentiation, ultimately leading to NSPC pool depletion. Our results disclose an important role for YME1L in coordinating the switch between metabolic states of NSPCs and suggest that NSPC fate is regulated by compartmentalized changes in protein network dynamics.

Abstract: The present study evaluated the therapeutic potential of soybean nano-isoflavone extract versus bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells derived extracellular exosomes (BMSCs-EXs) in experimentally induced neurodegenerative diseases in rats (ND). In this study, 36 albino male rats were divided into four groups: Group I (control rats); Group II (induced neurodegenerative disease in rats by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactose (120 mg/kg/day for 2 months); Group III (ND-induced rats treated with nano-isoflavone in doses of 10 mg/kg by oral gavage for 3 months); and Group IV (ND-induced rats treated with a single dose injection of BMSCs-EXs. The effect of BMSCs-EXs was evaluated by cerebral oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers, and mRNA gene expression quantitation for cerebral tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) and GAPDH pathway-encoding genes by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques. Then, histopathological examination of the cerebral cortical tissues. Our results showed that BMSC-EXs were successfully isolated and characterized. d-galactose produced a significant rise in the number of damaged neurons, decreased cerebral superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, increased cerebral malondialdehyde levels, downregulated the cerebral TNF-α, and i-NOS pathway-encoding genes. Furthermore, BMSC-EXs and nano-isoflavone treatments repaired damaged cerebral tissue and recovered its function greatly following induction of neurodegenerative disease. Treatment with either MSCs-EXs or nano-isoflavones led to significant improvement in the histological findings, reversed the degenerative effect of d-galactose, and had a favorable therapeutic utility against d- galactose-induced neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Summary
Recent genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens have identified genetic dependencies across many cancer cell lines. Associations between these dependencies and genomic alterations in the same cell lines reveal phenomena such as oncogene addiction and synthetic lethality. However, comprehensive identification of such associations is complicated by complex interactions between genes across genetically heterogeneous cancer types. We introduce and apply the algorithm SuperDendrix to CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens from 769 cancer cell lines, to identify differential dependencies across cell lines and to find associations between differential dependencies and combinations of genomic alterations and cell-type-specific markers. These associations respect the position and type of interactions within pathways: for example, we observe increased dependencies on downstream activators of pathways, such as NFE2L2, and decreased dependencies on upstream activators of pathways, such as CDK6. SuperDendrix also reveals dozens of dependencies on lineage-specific transcription factors, identifies cancer-type-specific correlations between dependencies, and enables annotation of individual mutated residues.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) reside within a three-dimensional extracellular matrix (ECM) compartment and differentiate into multiple cell lineages, thereby controlling tissue maintenance and regeneration. Within this environment, SSCs can proteolytically remodel the surrounding ECM in response to growth factors that direct lineage commitment via undefined mechanisms. Here, we report that Mmp14-dependent ECM remodeling coordinates canonical Wnt signaling and guides stem cell fate by triggering an integrin-activated reorganization of the SCC cytoskeleton that controls nuclear lamin A/C levels via the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes. In turn, SSC lamin A/C levels dictate the localization of emerin, an inner nuclear membrane protein whose ability to regulate β-catenin activity modulates Wnt signaling while directing lineage commitment in vitro and in vivo. These findings define a previously undescribed axis wherein SSCs use Mmp14-dependent ECM remodeling to control cytoskeletal and nucleoskeletal organization, thereby governing Wnt-dependent stem cell fate decisions.

Abstract: In Drosophila compound eyes, myosin-5 (DmMyo5) plays a key role in organelle transportation, including transporting pigment granules from the distal end to the proximal end of the photoreceptor cells to regulate the amount of light reaching the photosensitive membrane organelle rhabdomere. It is generally accepted that, upon exposure to light, the dark-adapted compound eyes produce a rapid rise of free Ca2+ concentration, which in turn activates DmMyo5 to transport pigment granules. Considering the dynamic and compartmentation of Ca2+ signaling in photoreceptor cells during light exposure, it is necessary to understand the kinetics of Ca2+ interaction with DmMyo5. Here, we investigated the interaction of Ca2+ with Drosophila calmodulin (CaM) in complex with the IQ1 of DmMyo5 using steady-state and kinetic approaches. Our results show that IQ1 binding substantially increases the Ca2+ affinity of CaM and decreases the dissociation rate of Ca2+ from CaM. In addition, we found that Mlc-C, the light chain associated with the IQ2 of DmMyo5, has little effect on the Ca2+ kinetics of CaM in IQ1. We propose that, by decreasing the Ca2+ dissociation rate from CaM, IQ1 delays the deactivation of DmMyo5 after Ca2+ transition, thereby prolonging the DmMyo5-driven transportation of pigment granules.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global health concern with no approved drugs. High-protein dietary intervention is currently the most effective treatment. However, its underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, using Drosophila oenocytes, the specialized hepatocyte-like cells, we find that dietary essential amino acids ameliorate hepatic steatosis by inducing polyubiquitination of Plin2, a lipid droplet-stabilizing protein. Leucine and isoleucine, two branched-chain essential amino acids, strongly bind to and activate the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr1, targeting Plin2 for degradation. We further show that the amino acid-induced Ubr1 activity is necessary to prevent steatosis in mouse livers and cultured human hepatocytes, providing molecular insight into the anti-NAFLD effects of dietary protein/amino acids. Importantly, split-intein-mediated trans-splicing expression of constitutively active UBR2, an Ubr1 family member, significantly ameliorates obesity-induced and high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice. Together, our results highlight activation of Ubr1 family proteins as a promising strategy in NAFLD treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Proton radiotherapy has been implemented into the standard-of-care for cancer patients within recent years. However, experimental studies investigating cellular and molecular mechanisms are lacking, and prognostic biomarkers are needed. Cancer stem cell (CSC)-related biomarkers, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), are known to influence cellular radiosensitivity through inactivation of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage repair, and cell death. In a previous study, we found that ionizing radiation itself enriches for ALDH-positive CSCs. In this study, we analyze CSC marker dynamics in prostate cancer, head and neck cancer, and glioblastoma cells upon proton beam irradiation. We find that proton irradiation has a higher potential to target CSCs through induction of complex DNA damages, lower rates of cellular senescence, and minor alteration in histone methylation pattern compared with conventional photon irradiation. Mathematical modeling indicates differences in plasticity rates among ALDH-positive CSCs and ALDH-negative cancer cells between the two irradiation types.

Abstract: Summary
The long-range interactions of cis-regulatory elements (cREs) play a central role in gene regulation. cREs can be characterized as accessible chromatin sequences. However, it remains technically challenging to comprehensively identify their spatial interactions. Here, we report a new method HiCAR (Hi-C on accessible regulatory DNA), which utilizes Tn5 transposase and chromatin proximity ligation, for the analysis of open-chromatin-anchored interactions with low-input cells. By applying HiCAR in human embryonic stem cells and lymphoblastoid cells, we demonstrate that HiCAR identifies high-resolution chromatin contacts with an efficiency comparable with that of in situ Hi-C over all distance ranges. Interestingly, we found that the “poised” gene promoters exhibit silencer-like function to repress the expression of distal genes via promoter-promoter interactions. Lastly, we applied HiCAR to 30,000 primary human muscle stem cells and demonstrated that HiCAR is capable of analyzing chromatin accessibility and looping using low-input primary cells and clinical samples.

Abstract: Summary
In the retina, ON starburst amacrine cells (SACs) play a crucial role in the direction-selective circuit, but the sources of inhibition that shape their response properties remain unclear. Previous studies demonstrate that ∼95% of their inhibitory synapses are GABAergic, yet we find that the light-evoked inhibitory currents measured in SACs are predominantly glycinergic. Glycinergic inhibition is extremely slow, relying on non-canonical glycine receptors containing α4 subunits, and is driven by both the ON and OFF retinal pathways. These attributes enable glycine inputs to summate and effectively control the output gain of SACs, expanding the range over which they compute direction. Serial electron microscopic reconstructions reveal three specific types of ON and OFF narrow-field amacrine cells as the presumptive sources of glycinergic inhibition. Together, these results establish an unexpected role for specific glycinergic amacrine cells in the retinal computation of stimulus direction by SACs.

Abstract: Summary
Primary human hepatocytes are widely used to evaluate liver toxicity of drugs, but they are scarce and demanding to culture. Stem cell-derived hepatocytes are increasingly discussed as alternatives. To obtain a better appreciation of the molecular processes during the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into hepatocytes, we employ a quantitative proteomic approach to follow the expression of 9,000 proteins, 12,000 phosphorylation sites, and 800 acetylation sites over time. The analysis reveals stage-specific markers, a major molecular switch between hepatic endoderm versus immature hepatocyte-like cells impacting, e.g., metabolism, the cell cycle, kinase activity, and the expression of drug transporters. Comparing the proteomes of two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)-derived hepatocytes with fetal and adult liver indicates a fetal-like status of the in vitro models and lower expression of important ADME/Tox proteins. The collective data enable constructing a molecular roadmap of hepatocyte development that serves as a valuable resource for future research.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired production of thymic regulatory T cells (Tregs) is implicated in the development of Aire-dependent autoimmunity. Because Tregs require agonistic T cell receptor stimuli by self-antigens to develop, reduced expression of self-antigens from medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) has been considered to play a major role in the reduced Treg production in Aire deficiency. Here, we show that mTECs abnormally express co-inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 if Aire is non-functional. Upon binding with CD80/CD86 ligands expressed on thymic dendritic cells (DCs), the ectopically expressed CTLA-4 from Aire-deficient mTECs removes the CD80/CD86 ligands from the DCs. This attenuates the ability of DCs to provide co-stimulatory signals and to present self-antigens transferred from mTECs, both of which are required for Treg production. Accordingly, impaired production of Tregs and organ-specific autoimmunity in Aire-deficient mice are rescued by the depletion of CTLA-4 expression from mTECs. Our studies illuminate the significance of mTEC-DC interaction coordinated by Aire for the establishment of thymic tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) contains abundant myofibroblasts derived from hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) through an activation process mediated by TGF-β. To determine the role of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in myofibroblastic activation of HSCs, we disrupted PD-L1 of HSCs by shRNA or anti-PD-L1 antibody. We find that PD-L1, produced by HSCs, is required for HSC activation by stabilizing TGF-β receptors I (TβRI) and II (TβRII). While the extracellular domain of PD-L1 (amino acids 19–238) targets TβRII protein to the plasma membrane and protects it from lysosomal degradation, a C-terminal 260-RLRKGR-265 motif on PD-L1 protects TβRI mRNA from degradation by the RNA exosome complex. PD-L1 is required for HSC expression of tumor-promoting factors, and targeting HSC PD-L1 by shRNA or Cre/loxP recombination suppresses HSC activation and ICC growth in mice. Thus, myofibroblast PD-L1 can modulate the tumor microenvironment and tumor growth by a mechanism independent of immune suppression.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1 Envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the sole target for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Env is heavily glycosylated with host-derived N-glycans, and many bnAbs bind to, or are dependent upon, Env glycans for neutralization. Although glycan-binding bnAbs are frequently detected in HIV-infected individuals, attempts to elicit them have been unsuccessful because of the poor immunogenicity of Env N-glycans. Here, we report cross-reactivity of glycan-binding bnAbs with self- and non-self N-glycans and glycoprotein antigens from different life-stages of Schistosoma mansoni. Using the IAVI Protocol C HIV infection cohort, we examine the relationship between S. mansoni seropositivity and development of bnAbs targeting glycan-dependent epitopes. We show that the unmutated common ancestor of the N332/V3-specific bnAb lineage PCDN76, isolated from an HIV-infected donor with S. mansoni seropositivity, binds to S. mansoni cercariae while lacking reactivity to gp120. Overall, these results present a strategy for elicitation of glycan-reactive bnAbs which could be exploited in HIV-1 vaccine development.

Abstract: Summary
Fundamental aspects of DNA replication, such as the anatomy of replication stall sites, how replisomes are influenced by gene transcription, and whether the progression of sister replisomes is coordinated, are poorly understood. Available techniques do not allow the precise mapping of the positions of individual replisomes on chromatin. We have developed a method called Replicon-seq that entails the excision of full-length replicons by controlled nuclease cleavage at replication forks. Replicons are sequenced using Nanopore, which provides a single-molecule readout of long DNA. Using Replicon-seq, we found that sister replisomes function autonomously and yet progress through chromatin with remarkable consistency. Replication forks that encounter obstacles pause for a short duration but rapidly resume synthesis. The helicase Rrm3 plays a critical role both in mitigating the effect of protein barriers and with facilitating efficient termination. Replicon-seq provides a high-resolution means of defining how individual replisomes move across the genome.

Abstract: The study was carried out on 42 male rats divided into six groups with 7 rats in each group: two control groups, two injury groups and two treatment groups. One of the control groups received a basal diet while the other one was fed a basal diet supplemented with royal jelly (RJ) (100 mg/kg). The two injury groups were given 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg fluoride, respectively. The two treatment groups exposed to 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg fluoride were both fed basal diets with RJ (100 mg/kg). Lungs were taken for histopathological examination. Spectrophotometric analysis was utilized to determine Malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) activities, and Western blotting technique was used to evaluate the levels of specific proteins. On one hand, our experiments revealed that RJ caused decreased MDA levels, and downregulation of COX-2, Bcl-2, GSK3 and TNF-α protein expressions. On the other hand, rolay jelly caused augmented GSH and CAT activities, as well as upregulated Bax, BDNF, caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-9 protein expressions in rats injuried by the fluoride exposure. The results suggest that the application of RJ was very likely to have a healing effect on the degenerative changes seen in the examined tissue.

Abstract: Somatic cells in the gonadal area of male and female deep-sea clams, Calyptogena pacifica, were examined using light and transmission electron microscopy. Acini both at the pre-spawning stage and at the stage of active spermatogenesis were observed to be simultaneously present in sections through a male gonad. Oocytes of various degrees of maturity were simultaneously present in female acini. No storage tissue and cells similar to adipogranular cells or vesicular connective tissue of other mollusks were found in the gonadal area of C. pacifica. Instead, in both males and females, numerous hemocytes surround the acini. Among hemocytes, two types of granulocytes and erythrocytes were identified. Bundles of muscle cells were also found in the interacinar space. Male intraacinar accessory cells were rather large, glycogen-rich, with lipid inclusions, and phagosomes contained spermatogenic cells. Female accessory cells had well-developed endoplasmic reticulum, but they did not form any follicles around oocytes, being in their basal part, closer to basal lamina. Such a specific pattern of gonad organization can presumably be explained by both symbiosis with sulfide-oxidizing bacteria and phylogenetic aspects that should be further studied. Some evidence for continuous gametogenesis are discussed.

Abstract: Summary
Non-coding DNA variants (NCVs) impact gene expression by altering binding sites for regulatory complexes. New high-throughput methods are needed to characterize the impact of NCVs on regulatory complexes. We developed CASCADE (Customizable Approach to Survey Complex Assembly at DNA Elements), an array-based high-throughput method to profile cofactor (COF) recruitment. CASCADE identifies DNA-bound transcription factor-cofactor (TF-COF) complexes in nuclear extracts and quantifies the impact of NCVs on their binding. We demonstrate CASCADE sensitivity in characterizing condition-specific recruitment of COFs p300 and RBBP5 (MLL subunit) to the CXCL10 promoter in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human macrophages and quantify the impact of all possible NCVs. To demonstrate applicability to NCV screens, we profile TF-COF binding to ∼1,700 single-nucleotide polymorphism quantitative trait loci (SNP-QTLs) in human macrophages and identify perturbed ETS domain-containing complexes. CASCADE will facilitate high-throughput testing of molecular mechanisms of NCVs for diverse biological applications.

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the expression levels of fibrinogen α chain (FGA) in human gastric cancer (GC) tissues and cell lines, clarify its role in gastric cancer progression, and explore its underlying mechanism. Bioinformatics analysis, Immunoblot, Immunohistochemical (IHC), and quantitative PCR assays were performed to assess the expression of FGA in human gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were performed to detect its role in the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Wound healing, transwell, and Immunofluorescence were performed to detect its effects on gastric cancer cell motility and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes. Luciferase and CHIP assays were performed to confirm the transcriptional regulation of FGA on ITGA5. Immunoblot assays and double-label RFP-GFP-LC3 immunofluorescence analysis were conducted to detect its effects on gastric cancer cell autophagy and FAK/ERK pathway, and in vivo tumor growth assays were further performed. We found the low expression of FGA in human gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. FGA suppressed gastric cancer cell proliferation, motility, and EMT process, and stimulated cell autophagy. We further found that FGA suppressed the expression of Integrin-α5 (ITGA5) and inhibited the FAK/ERK pathway, therefore suppressing the progression of gastric cancer. The in vivo assays further confirmed that FGA suppressed tumor growth of gastric cancer cells in the BALB/c nude mice (18–22 g, female, 8-week-old) through suppressing ITGA5-mediated FAK/ERK pathway in mice. We demonstrated the mechanism underlying FGA suppressing gastric cancer progression, and therefore we thought FGA could serve as a tumor suppressor protein in gastric cancer.

Abstract: PGE2 is a potent bronchodilator, but the mechanisms underlying this effect have not been fully elucidated. Acetylcholine-induced contractions of airway smooth muscle (ASM) are associated with the generation of repetitive Ca2+ oscillations in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) and the force of contraction is positively correlated with the frequency of the underlying Ca2+ oscillations. The purpose of the present study was to examine if carbachol-evoked Ca2+ oscillations in isolated ASMC were inhibited by PGE2. Isolated murine ASMC loaded with fluo4-AM were imaged with a Nipkow spinning disk confocal microscope. Cells responded to application of CCh (1 μM) by generating an initial Ca2+ transient followed by a series of Ca2+ oscillations. This activity was abolished by PGE2 (300 nM) and the EP2R agonist (R)-butaprost (3 μM) and the inhibitory effects of PGE2 were reversed by application of the EP2R antagonist PF-04418948 (100 nM). Activation of adenylate cyclase using forskolin (1 μM) mimicked the effects of PGE2. The PKA activator, 6-MB-cAMP (300 μM) reduced the frequency of CCh-induced Ca2+ oscillations by 33% and the PKA inhibitor Rp-8-CPT-cAMPs partially reversed the inhibitory effects of PGE2. The EPAC activator 007-AM (10 μM) reduced the frequency of the oscillations by 60% and joint application of 007-AM and 6-MB-cAMP reduced oscillation frequency by ∼85%. CCh-induced Ca2+ oscillations were inhibited by 2-APB and tetracaine, but caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transients were resistant to PGE2. These data suggest that PGE2 inhibits CCh-induced Ca2+ oscillations in murine ASMC via stimulation of EP2Rs and a mechanism involving activation of PKA and EPAC.

Abstract: Summary
Haploinsufficiency describes a phenomenon where one functioning allele is insufficient for a normal phenotype, underlying several human diseases. The effect of haploinsufficiency on human embryonic stem cells (hESC) has not been thoroughly studied. To establish a genome-wide loss-of-function screening for heterozygous mutations, we fuse normal haploid hESCs with a library of mutant haploid hESCs. We identify over 600 genes with a negative effect on hESC growth in a haploinsufficient manner and characterize them as genes showing less tolerance to mutations, conservation during evolution, and depletion from telomeres and X chromosome. Interestingly, a large fraction of these genes is associated with extracellular matrix and plasma membrane and enriched for genes within WNT and TGF-β pathways. We thus identify haploinsufficiency-related genes that show growth retardation in early embryonic cells, suggesting dosage-dependent phenotypes in hESCs. Overall, we construct a unique model for studying haploinsufficiency and identified important dosage-dependent pathways involved in hESC growth and survival.

Abstract: Summary
The nucleus is highly compartmentalized through the formation of distinct classes of membraneless domains. However, the composition and function of many of these structures are not well understood. Using APEX2-mediated proximity labeling and RNA sequencing, we surveyed human transcripts associated with nuclear speckles, several additional domains, and the lamina. Remarkably, speckles and lamina are associated with distinct classes of retained introns enriched in genes that function in RNA processing, translation, and the cell cycle, among other processes. In contrast to the lamina-proximal introns, retained introns associated with speckles are relatively short, GC-rich, and enriched for functional sites of RNA-binding proteins that are concentrated in these domains. They are also highly differentially regulated across diverse cellular contexts, including the cell cycle. Thus, our study provides a resource of nuclear domain-associated transcripts and further reveals speckles and lamina as hubs of distinct populations of retained introns linked to gene regulation and cell cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanically activated Piezo channel plays a versatile role in conferring mechanosensitivity to various cell types. However, how it incorporates its intrinsic mechanosensitivity and cellular components to effectively sense long-range mechanical perturbation across a cell remains elusive. Here we show that Piezo channels are biochemically and functionally tethered to the actin cytoskeleton via the cadherin-β-catenin mechanotransduction complex, whose perturbation significantly impairs Piezo-mediated responses. Mechanistically, the adhesive extracellular domain of E-cadherin interacts with the cap domain of Piezo1, which controls the transmembrane gate, while its cytosolic tail might interact with the cytosolic domains of Piezo1, which are in close proximity to its intracellular gates, allowing a direct focus of adhesion-cytoskeleton-transmitted force for gating. Specific disruption of the intermolecular interactions prevents cytoskeleton-dependent gating of Piezo1. Thus, we propose a force-from-filament model to complement the previously suggested force-from-lipids model for mechanogating of Piezo channels, enabling them to serve as versatile and tunable mechanotransducers.

Abstract: Summary
RAS guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) are mutated in nearly 20% of human tumors, making them an attractive therapeutic target. Following our discovery that nucleotide-free RAS (apo RAS) regulates cell signaling, we selectively target this state as an approach to inhibit RAS function. Here, we describe the R15 monobody that exclusively binds the apo state of all three RAS isoforms in vitro, regardless of the mutation status, and captures RAS in the apo state in cells. R15 inhibits the signaling and transforming activity of a subset of RAS mutants with elevated intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates (i.e., fast exchange mutants). Intracellular expression of R15 reduces the tumor-forming capacity of cancer cell lines driven by select RAS mutants and KRAS(G12D)-mutant patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Thus, our approach establishes an opportunity to selectively inhibit a subset of RAS mutants by targeting the apo state with drug-like molecules.

Abstract: Summary
As central effectors of ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated proteolysis, proteasomes are regulated at multiple levels, including degradation of unwanted or dysfunctional particles via autophagy (termed proteaphagy). In yeast, inactive proteasomes are exported from the nucleus, sequestered into cytoplasmic aggresomes via the Hsp42 chaperone, extensively ubiquitylated, and then tethered to the expanding phagophore by the autophagy receptor Cue5. Here, we demonstrate the need for ubiquitylation driven by the trio of Ub ligases (E3s), San1, Rsp5, and Hul5, which together with their corresponding E2s work sequentially to promote nuclear export and Cue5 recognition. Whereas San1 functions prior to nuclear export, Rsp5 and Hul5 likely decorate aggresome-localized proteasomes in concert. Ultimately, topologically complex Ub chain(s) containing both K48 and K63 Ub-Ub linkages are assembled, mainly on the regulatory particle, to generate autophagy-competent substrates. Because San1, Rsp5, Hul5, Hsp42, and Cue5 also participate in general proteostasis, proteaphagy likely engages a fundamental mechanism for eliminating inactive/misfolded proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington disease (HD) is a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder with one causative gene, huntingtin (HTT). Yet, HD pathobiology is multifactorial, suggesting that cellular factors influence disease progression. Here, we define HTT protein-protein interactions (PPIs) perturbed by the mutant protein with expanded polyglutamine in the mouse striatum, a brain region with selective HD vulnerability. Using metabolically labeled tissues and immunoaffinity purification-mass spectrometry, we establish that polyglutamine-dependent modulation of HTT PPI abundances and relative stability starts at an early stage of pathogenesis in a Q140 HD mouse model. We identify direct and indirect PPIs that are also genetic disease modifiers using in-cell two-hybrid and behavioral assays in HD human cell and Drosophila models, respectively. Validated, disease-relevant mHTT-dependent interactions encompass mediators of synaptic neurotransmission (SNAREs and glutamate receptors) and lysosomal acidification (V-ATPase). Our study provides a resource for understanding mHTT-dependent dysfunction in cortico-striatal cellular networks, partly through impaired synaptic communication and endosomal-lysosomal system. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) are affected four times more by tendinopathies than non-diabetics. On the other hand, physical activity helps to DM control. However, the effects of physical exercise in water (PEW) on the fibrocartilages present in the tendons of animals affected by DM are unknown. In this sense, the aim of this study was to analyze the structural organization and chemical composition of fibrocartilage present in the intermediate region of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of Wistar rats with alloxan-induced DM. Diabetic and non-diabetic animals were randomly separated into four experimental groups (n = 10): Non-Trained Control (NTC), Trained Control (TC), Non-Trained Diabetic (NTD), and Trained Diabetic (TD). TC and TD animals underwent the exercise protocol (total weekly training load - week 1: 14,375; 2: 16,500; 3: 18,375; 4: 20,000) and then were euthanized to collect tendon samples for analysis. The matrix basophilia was more intense in the TC and TD groups. The Decorin immunohistochemical test results showed greater intensity in the NTD and TD groups. The wet weight of the fibrocartilaginous region of the tendon (NTC:19.9 ± 0.06; TC:22.3 ± 0.05; NTD:20.3 ± 0.08; TD:21.8 ± 0.04 mg - p = 0.048), glycosaminoglycan amounts (NTC:3.21 ± 0.18; TC:3.98 ± 0.44; NTD:3.32 ± 0.19; TD:3.79 ± 0.28 μg/mg of fresh tissue - p = 0.046), and intumescence in water (NTC:13.8 ± 3.8; TC:24.3 ± 3.9; NTD:14.9 ± 3.9; TD:28.2 ± 5.3 % w/w - p = 0.042) were higher in the TC and TD groups. The TD group showed the highest levels of type I collagen and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13. The TC group showed the highest and TD the lowest TGF-β1 levels. In conclusion, the PEW was able to stimulate the deposition of proteoglycans, without inducing chemical changes that would cause histopathological modifications in fibrocartilage in the DDFT of adult rats. Thus, PEW preserves the structural organization of these tissues in tendons of animals affected by DM.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the long-term maintenance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunity is critical for predicting protection against reinfection. In an age- and gender-matched cohort of 24 participants, the association of disease severity and early immune responses on the maintenance of humoral immunity 12 months post-infection is examined. All severely affected participants maintain a stable subset of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific memory B cells (MBCs) and good neutralizing antibody breadth against the majority of the variants of concern, including the Delta variant. Modeling these immune responses against vaccine efficacy data indicate a 45%–76% protection against symptomatic infection (variant dependent). Overall, these findings indicate durable humoral responses in most participants after infection, reasonable protection against reinfection, and implicate baseline antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses as a predictor of maintenance of antibody neutralization breadth and RBD-specific MBC levels at 12 months post-infection.

Abstract: Summary
Asprosin is a fasting-induced glucogenic and centrally acting orexigenic hormone. The olfactory receptor Olfr734 is known to be the hepatic receptor for asprosin that mediates its effects on glucose production, but the receptor for asprosin’s orexigenic function has been unclear. Here, we have identified protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor δ (Ptprd) as the orexigenic receptor for asprosin. Asprosin functions as a high-affinity Ptprd ligand in hypothalamic AgRP neurons, regulating the activity of this circuit in a cell-autonomous manner. Genetic ablation of Ptprd results in a strong loss of appetite, leanness, and an inability to respond to the orexigenic effects of asprosin. Ablation of Ptprd specifically in AgRP neurons causes resistance to diet-induced obesity. Introduction of the soluble Ptprd ligand-binding domain in the circulation of mice suppresses appetite and blood glucose levels by sequestering plasma asprosin. Identification of Ptprd as the orexigenic asprosin receptor creates a new avenue for the development of anti-obesity therapeutics.

Abstract: Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) infection causes severe hand-foot-and-mouth disease that leads to cardiopulmonary complications and death in young children under 5 years of age. Although there are available vaccines for EV-A71 C4, however, there are no efficient drugs for severe cases. Thus, there is an urgent need to find new direct-antiviral agents (DAAs) to control EV-A71 infection. In this study, we report our discovery of the EV-A71 capsid inhibitor PTC-209HBr, a small-molecule Bmi-1 inhibitor and an anticancer agent, and its derivatives that inhibit multiple enteroviruses with an EC50 at a submicromolar efficacy. The mechanism of action of PTC-209HBr was confirmed by time-of-addition, resistance selection and reverse genetics experiments, microscale thermophoresis (MST), viral binding and entry assays, coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and immunofluorescence experiments (IF). Mechanistic studies indicated that PTC-209HBr inhibited EV-A71 infection by impeding the binding between VP1 and the receptor hSCARB2 during the early stage of EV-A71 infection through hindering viral entry into host cells. Collectively, these findings indicated that PCT-209HBr is a novel inhibitor of enteroviruses with a confirmed mechanism of action that can be further developed into EV-A71 DAAs.

Abstract: The role of long non-coding RNA ACTA2 antisense RNA 1 (LncRNA ACTA2-AS1) in colorectal cancer (CRC) was awaited to be elucidated. Clinical specimen and data on ACTA2-AS1 expression in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) were collected, followed by in situ hybridization. Transfected CRC cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion were determined with Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, Scratch, and Transwell assays, respectively. Relative expressions of ACTA2-AS1, PCNA, Bcl-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot. ACTA2-AS1 expression was downregulated in CRC. Overexpressed ACTA2-AS1 repressed the cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion, increased cleaved caspase-3 level yet decreased PCNA, Bcl-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. ACTA2-AS1 silencing, however, did oppositely. Collectively, ACTA2-AS1 inhibits the viability, proliferation, migration and invasion of CRC cells to effectively suppress the progression of CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Fumarate is an oncometabolite. However, the mechanism underlying fumarate-exerted tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, utilizing human type2 papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC2) as a model, we show that fumarate accumulates in cells deficient in fumarate hydratase (FH) and inhibits PTEN to activate PI3K/AKT signaling. Mechanistically, fumarate directly reacts with PTEN at cysteine 211 (C211) to form S-(2-succino)-cysteine. Succinated C211 occludes tethering of PTEN with the cellular membrane, thereby diminishing its inhibitory effect on the PI3K/AKT pathway. Functionally, re-expressing wild-type FH or PTEN C211S phenocopies an AKT inhibitor in suppressing tumor growth and sensitizing PRCC2 to sunitinib. Analysis of clinical specimens indicates that PTEN C211 succination levels are positively correlated with AKT activation in PRCC2. Collectively, these findings elucidate a non-metabolic, oncogenic role of fumarate in PRCC2 via direct post-translational modification of PTEN and further reveal potential stratification strategies for patients with FH loss by combinatorial AKTi and sunitinib therapy.

Abstract: Summary
BMI-1 is an essential regulator of transcriptional silencing during development. Recently, the role of BMI-1 in the DNA damage response has gained much attention, but the exact mechanism of how BMI-1 participates in the process is unclear. Here, we establish a role for BMI-1 in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination (HR), where it promotes DNA end resection. Mechanistically, BMI-1 mediates DNA end resection by facilitating the recruitment of CtIP, thus allowing RPA and RAD51 accumulation at DNA damage sites. Interestingly, treatment with transcription inhibitors rescues the DNA end resection defects of BMI-1-depleted cells, suggesting BMI-1-dependent transcriptional silencing mediates DNA end resection. Moreover, we find that H2A ubiquitylation at K119 (H2AK119ub) promotes end resection. Taken together, our results identify BMI-1-mediated transcriptional silencing and promotion of H2AK119ub deposition as essential regulators of DNA end resection and thus the progression of HR.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cells (DCs) induce peripheral T cell tolerance, but cell-intrinsic signaling cascades governing their stable tolerogenesis remain poorly defined. Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) transduces cytokine-receptor signaling, and JAK inhibitors (Jakinibs), including JAK1-specific filgotinib, break inflammatory cycles in autoimmunity. Here, we report in heterogeneous DC populations of multiple secondary lymphoid organs that JAK1 promotes peripheral T cell tolerance during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mice harboring DC-specific JAK1 deletion exhibit elevated peripheral CD4+ T cell expansion, less regulatory T cells (Tregs), and worse EAE outcomes, whereas adoptive DC transfer ameliorates EAE pathogenesis by inducing peripheral Tregs, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) dependently. This tolerogenic program is substantially reduced upon the transfer of JAK1-deficient DCs. DC-intrinsic IFN-γ-JAK1-STAT1 signaling induces PD-L1, which is required for DCs to convert CD4+ T cells into Tregs in vitro and attenuated upon JAK1 deficiency and filgotinib treatment. Thus, DC-intrinsic JAK1 promotes peripheral tolerance, suggesting potential unwarranted DC-mediated effects of Jakinibs in autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
AGO/miRNA-mediated gene silencing and ubiquitin-mediated protein quality control represent two fundamental mechanisms that control proper gene expression. Here, we unexpectedly discover that fly and human AGO proteins, which are key components in the miRNA pathway, undergo lipid-mediated phase separation and condense into RNP granules on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to control protein production. Phase separation on the ER is mediated by electrostatic interactions between a conserved lipid-binding motif within the AGOs and the lipid PI(4,5)P2. The ER-localized AGO condensates recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1 to catalyze nascent-peptide ubiquitination and coordinate with the VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex to process unwanted protein products for proteasomal degradation. Collectively, our study provides insight into the understanding of post-transcription-translation coupling controlled by AGOs via lipid-mediated phase separation.

Abstract: Summary
Escherichia coli cell cycle features two critical cell-cycle checkpoints: initiation of replication and the onset of constriction. While the initiation of DNA replication has been extensively studied, it is less clear what triggers the onset of constriction and when exactly it occurs during the cell cycle. Here, using high-throughput fluorescence microscopy in microfluidic devices, we determine the timing for the onset of constriction relative to the replication cycle in different growth rates. Our single-cell data and modeling indicate that the initiation of constriction is coupled to replication-related processes in slow growth conditions. Furthermore, our data suggest that this coupling involves the mid-cell chromosome blocking the onset of constriction via some form of nucleoid occlusion occurring independently of SlmA and the Ter linkage proteins. This work highlights the coupling between replication and division cycles and brings up a new nucleoid mediated control mechanism in E. coli.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic flexibility is a hallmark of many cancers where mitochondrial respiration is critically involved, but the molecular underpinning of mitochondrial control of cancer metabolic reprogramming is poorly understood. Here, we show that reverse electron transfer (RET) through respiratory chain complex I (RC-I) is particularly active in brain cancer stem cells (CSCs). Although RET generates ROS, NAD+/NADH ratio turns out to be key in mediating RET effect on CSC proliferation, in part through the NAD+-dependent Sirtuin. Mechanistically, Notch acts in an unconventional manner to regulate RET by interacting with specific RC-I proteins containing electron-transporting Fe–S clusters and NAD(H)-binding sites. Genetic and pharmacological interference of Notch-mediated RET inhibited CSC growth in Drosophila brain tumor and mouse glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) models. Our results identify Notch as a regulator of RET and RET-induced NAD+/NADH balance, a critical mechanism of metabolic reprogramming and a metabolic vulnerability of cancer that may be exploited for therapeutic purposes.

Abstract: Summary
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) are metabolic kinases that co-ordinate nutrient supply with cell growth. AMPK negatively regulates mTORC1, and mTORC1 reciprocally phosphorylates S345/7 in both AMPK α-isoforms. We report that genetic or torin1-induced loss of α2-S345 phosphorylation relieves suppression of AMPK signaling; however, the regulatory effect does not translate to α1-S347 in HEK293T or MEF cells. Dephosphorylation of α2-S345, but not α1-S347, transiently targets AMPK to lysosomes, a cellular site for activation by LKB1. By mass spectrometry, we find that α2-S345 is basally phosphorylated at 2.5-fold higher stoichiometry than α1-S347 in HEK293T cells and, unlike α1, phosphorylation is partially retained after prolonged mTORC1 inhibition. Loss of α2-S345 phosphorylation in endogenous AMPK fails to sustain growth of MEFs under amino acid starvation conditions. These findings uncover an α2-specific mechanism by which AMPK can be activated at lysosomes in the absence of changes in cellular energy.

Abstract: Summary
DOT1L methylates histone H3 lysine 79 during transcriptional elongation and is stimulated by ubiquitylation of histone H2B lysine 120 (H2BK120ub) in a classical trans-histone crosstalk pathway. Aberrant genomic localization of DOT1L is implicated in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemias, an aggressive subset of leukemias that lacks effective targeted treatments. Despite recent atomic structures of DOT1L in complex with H2BK120ub nucleosomes, fundamental questions remain as to how DOT1L-ubiquitin and DOT1L-nucleosome acidic patch interactions observed in these structures contribute to nucleosome binding and methylation by DOT1L. Here, we combine bulk and single-molecule biophysical measurements with cancer cell biology to show that ubiquitin and cofactor binding drive conformational changes to stimulate DOT1L activity. Using structure-guided mutations, we demonstrate that ubiquitin and nucleosome acidic patch binding by DOT1L are required for cell proliferation in the MV4; 11 leukemia model, providing proof of principle for MLL targeted therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Organoid evolution models complemented with integrated single-cell sequencing technology provide a powerful platform to characterize intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) and tumor evolution. Here, we conduct a parallel evolution experiment to mimic the tumor evolution process by evolving a colon cancer organoid model over 100 generations, spanning 6 months in time. We use single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in combination with viral lineage tracing at 12 time points to simultaneously monitor clone size, CNV states, SNV states, and viral lineage barcodes for 1,641 single cells. We integrate these measurements to construct clonal evolution trees with high resolution. We characterize the order of events in which chromosomal aberrations occur and identify aberrations that recur multiple times within the same tumor sub-population. We observe recurrent sequential loss of chromosome 4 after loss of chromosome 18 in four unique tumor clones. SNVs and CNVs identified in our organoid experiments are also frequently reported in colorectal carcinoma samples, and out of 334 patients with chromosome 18 loss in a Memorial Sloan Kettering colorectal cancer cohort, 99 (29.6%) also harbor chromosome 4 loss. Our study reconstructs tumor evolution in a colon cancer organoid model at high resolution, demonstrating an approach to identify potentially clinically relevant genomic aberrations in tumor evolution.

Abstract: Luteolin inhibits tumorigenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its mechanism still needs to be clarified. We hereby explored the effects of luteolin in vascular endothelial cells of NSCLC (NSCLC-VECs). After extraction and identification of NSCLC-VECs, cells were treated with luteolin and transfected. The viability, migration, angiogenesis and invasion of the cells were measured. The levels of miR-133a-3p, purine rich element binding protein B (PURB), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/-9 were determined. The interaction relationship of miR-133a-3p and PURB was identified. Luteolin inhibited the viability, migration, angiogenesis and invasion of NSCLC-VECs yet up-regulated miR-133a-3p level, while miR-133a-3p inhibitor counteracted the repressive effect of luteolin on the viability, migration, angiogenesis, and invasion in NSCLC-VECs. Luteolin inhibited the expressions of migration- and invasion-associated proteins (VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9), PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways-related factors, while miR-133a-3p inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of Luteolin on NSCLC-VECs. Luteolin decreased the level of PURB, which was targeted by miR-133a-3p. ShPURB promoted miR-133a-3p level in NSCLC-VECs, while reversing the promoting effects of miR-133a-3p inhibitor on the migration, invasion, and levels of migration- and invasion-associated proteins, PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways-associated factors in NSCLC-VECs. Collectively speaking, luteolin inhibits the migration and invasion of NSCLC-VECs via miR-133a-3p/PURB- mediated MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways.

Abstract: Cartilage stem/progenitor cells (CSPCs) was recently isolated and identified from the cartilage tissue. CSPCs is essential for repair and regeneration of cartilage in osteoarthritis (OA). Aging is a primary risk factor for cartilage damage and joint OA. Although studies have confirmed the link between cell aging and OA, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating CSPCs aging are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of Pin1 in the aging of rat knee joint CSPCs. We isolated CSPCs from rat knee joints and demonstrated that, in long-term in vitro culture, Pin1 protein levels are significantly reduced. At the same time, expression of the senescence-related β-galactosidase and the senescence marker p16INK4A were markedly elevated. In addition, Pin1 overexpression reversed the progression of cellular senescence, as evidenced by the down-regulation of senescence-related β-galactosidase, increased EdU positive cells and diminished levels of p16INK4A. In contrast, Pin1 siRNA incorporation promoted CSPCs senescence. In addition, we also observed the distribution of cell cycles through flow cytometry and revealed that Pin1 deficiency results in cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, suggesting severe lack of proliferation ability, a sign of cellular senescence. Collectively, these results validated that Pin1 is an essential regulator of CSPCs aging.
