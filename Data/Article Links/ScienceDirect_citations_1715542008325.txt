Abstract: Aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptors are important regulators of inflammation. During this process, chemokines and extracellular matrix degradation by matrix metalloproteases, such as MMP-9, help leukocytes reaching swiftly and infiltrating the injured tissue, two processes essential for tissue repair. Leukocytes, such as neutrophils, are a rich source of MMP-9 and possess mineralocorticoid receptors (MR). The aim of our study was to investigate whether aldosterone was able to regulate proMMP-9, active MMP-9 and MMP-9/NGAL production in human neutrophils. Here we show that aldosterone increased MMP-9 mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This hormone up-regulated also dose-dependently proMMP-9 and active MMP-9 protein release as well as the MMP-9/NGAL protein complex. PI3K, p38 and ERK1/2 inhibition diminished these aldosterone-induced neutrophil productions. Furthermore, spironolactone, a MR antagonist, counteracted aldosterone-induced increases of proMMP-9, active MMP-9 and MMP-9/NGAL complex. These findings indicate that aldosterone could participate in tissue repair by modulating neutrophil activity and favoring extracellular matrix degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represent a renewable source of pancreatic beta cells for both basic research and therapeutic applications. Given this outstanding potential, significant efforts have been made to identify the signaling pathways that regulate pancreatic development in hPSC differentiation cultures. In this study, we demonstrate that the combination of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and nicotinamide signaling induces the generation of NKX6-1+ progenitors from all hPSC lines tested. Furthermore, we show that the size of the NKX6-1+ population is regulated by the duration of treatment with retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10), and inhibitors of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and hedgehog signaling pathways. When transplanted into NOD scid gamma (NSG) recipients, these progenitors differentiate to give rise to exocrine and endocrine cells, including monohormonal insulin+ cells. Together, these findings provide an efficient and reproducible strategy for generating highly enriched populations of hPSC-derived beta cell progenitors for studies aimed at further characterizing their developmental potential in vivo and deciphering the pathways that regulate their maturation in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a frequent form of early-onset dementia and can be caused by mutations in MAPT encoding the microtubule-associated protein TAU. Because of limited availability of neural cells from patients’ brains, the underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration in FTD are poorly understood. Here, we derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from individuals with FTD-associated MAPT mutations and differentiated them into mature neurons. Patient iPSC-derived neurons demonstrated pronounced TAU pathology with increased fragmentation and phospho-TAU immunoreactivity, decreased neurite extension, and increased but reversible oxidative stress response to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, FTD neurons showed an activation of the unfolded protein response, and a transcriptome analysis demonstrated distinct, disease-associated gene expression profiles. These findings indicate distinct neurodegenerative changes in FTD caused by mutant TAU and highlight the unique opportunity to use neurons differentiated from patient-specific iPSCs to identify potential targets for drug screening purposes and therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) can be differentiated into Schwann cell-like cells which enhance nerve function and regeneration. However, the signalling mechanisms underlying the neurotrophic potential of ADSC remain largely unknown. In this study, we hypothesised that ADSC, upon stimulation with a combination of growth factors, could rapidly produce brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with a similar molecular mechanism to that functioning in the nervous system. Within 48h of stimulation, ADSC demonstrated potent neurotrophic effects on dorsal root ganglion neurons, at a magnitude equivalent to that of the longer term differentiated Schwann cell-like cells. Stimulated ADSC showed rapid up-regulation of the neuronal activity dependent promoter BDNF exon IV along with an augmented expression of full length protein encoding BDNF exon IX. BDNF protein was secreted at a concentration similar to that produced by differentiated Schwann cell-like cells. Stimulation also activated the BDNF expression gating transcription factor, cAMP responsive element binding (CREB) protein. However, blocking phosphorylation of CREB with the protein kinase A small molecule inhibitor H89 did not suppress secretion of BDNF protein. These results suggest rapid BDNF production in ADSC is mediated through multiple compensatory pathways independent of, or in addition to, the CREB neuronal activation cascade.

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrated that the ligand-activated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorα (PPARα) acts in association with histone deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the regulation of metabolism and inflammation involved in cardiovascular diseases. PPARα activation also participates in the modulation of cell apoptosis. Our previous study found that SIRT1 inhibits the apoptosis of vascular adventitial fibroblasts (VAFs). However, whether the role of PPARα in apoptosis of VAFs is mediated by SIRT1 remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of PPARα agonist fenofibrate on cell apoptosis and SIRT1 expression and related mechanisms in ApoE−/− mice and VAFs in vitro. We found that fenofibrate inhibited cell apoptosis in vascular adventitia and up-regulated SIRT1 expression in aorta of ApoE−/− mice. Moreover, SIRT1 activator resveratrol (RSV) further enhanced these effects of fenofibrate. In vitro study showed that activation of PPARα by fenofibrate inhibited TNF-α-induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in VAFs. Meanwhile, fenofibrate up-regulated SIRT1 expression and inhibited SIRT1 translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm in VAFs stimulated with TNF-α. Moreover, the effects of fenofibrate on cell apoptosis and SIRT1 expression in VAFs were reversed by PPARα antagonist GW6471. Importantly, treatment of VAFs with SIRT1 siRNA or pcDNA3.1(+)-SIRT1 showed that the inhibitory effect of fenofibrate on cell apoptosis in VAFs through SIRT1. On the other hand, knockdown of FoxO1 decreased cell apoptosis of VAFs compared with fenofibrate group. Overexpression of FoxO1 increased cell apoptosis of VAFs compared with fenofibrate group. Further study found that fenofibrate decreased the expression of acetylated-FoxO1 in TNF-α-stimulated VAFs, which was abolished by SIRT1 knockdown. Taken together, these findings indicate that activation of PPARα by fenofibrate inhibits cell apoptosis in VAFs partly through the SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of FoxO1.

Abstract: Molecular mechanisms underlying synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity have become one of the main topics in neurobiology. Increasing evidence suggests that axon guidance molecules including semaphorins and plexins participate in synapse formation and elimination. Although class B plexins are widely expressed in the brain, their role in the nervous system remains poorly characterized. We previously identified that B-plexins modulate microtubule dynamics and through this impact dendrite growth in rat hippocampal neurons. Here, we demonstrate that Plexin-B2 and Plexin-B3 are present in dendrites, but do not localize in synapses. We find that overexpression of all B-plexins leads to decreased volume of excitatory synapses, and at the same time Plexin-B1 and Plexin-B3 promote inhibitory synapse assembly. Plexin-B3 mutants revealed that these processes use different downstream pathways. While elimination of excitatory synapses is the result of Plexin-B3 binding to microtubule end binding proteins EB1 and EB3, the increase in inhibitory synapses is mediated by regulation of Ras and Rho GTPases. Overall, our findings demonstrate that Plexin-B3 contributes to regulating synapse formation.

Abstract: Summary
Metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (GRM7) has recently been identified to be associated with brain developmental defects, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. However, the function of GRM7 during brain development remains largely unknown. Here, we used gain- and loss-of-function strategies to investigate the role of GRM7 in early cortical development. We demonstrate that Grm7 knockdown increases neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation, decreases terminal mitosis and neuronal differentiation, and leads to abnormal neuronal morphology. GRM7 regulates the phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and the expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) by directly interacting with CaM, which subsequently regulates the expression of CyclinD1 and ultimately affects early cortical development. These defects in neurogenesis are ameliorated by Grm7 overexpression, Creb knockdown, or Yap knockdown. Thus, our findings indicate that GRM7 signaling via CREB and YAP is necessary for neurogenesis in the brain.

Abstract: Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs) are multifunctional proteins that inhibit matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). The latest described member of the family, TIMP-4, is expressed mainly in adipose tissue, with detectable levels in the brain and heart. Besides its high expression in fat, the role of this inhibitor in adipose tissue is unknown. In order to study the role of TIMP-4 during adipogenesis in vitro, 3T3-L1 cells were stably transfected with a TIMP-4 specific shRNA or a control shRNA. Unexpectedly, upon TIMP-4 knockdown, 3T3-L1 cells differentiated faster into mature adipocytes. To get better insight of TIMP-4׳s role in adipogenesis, microarray expression analyses were performed. Network enrichment analyses uncovered 25 significant upstream signaling pathways, among which the NFκB cascade was found. Previous works have shown that NFκB is a key regulator of adipogenesis. In accordance, we found that TIMP-4 knockdown decreased NFκB activity during adipogenesis. The present work suggests that TIMP-4 might act as a negative regulator of adipogenesis through NFκB cascade modulation.

Abstract: Summary
Dysfunction of the specialized cardiac conduction system (CCS) is associated with life-threatening arrhythmias. Strategies to derive CCS cells, including rare Purkinje cells (PCs), would facilitate models for mechanistic studies and drug discovery and also provide new cellular materials for regenerative therapies. A high-throughput chemical screen using CCS:lacz and Contactin2:egfp (Cntn2:egfp) reporter embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines was used to discover a small molecule, sodium nitroprusside (SN), that efficiently promotes the generation of cardiac cells that express gene profiles and generate action potentials of PC-like cells. Imaging and mechanistic studies suggest that SN promotes the generation of PCs from cardiac progenitors initially expressing cardiac myosin heavy chain and that it does so by activating cyclic AMP signaling. These findings provide a strategy to derive scalable PCs, along with insight into the ontogeny of CCS development.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms regulating human embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal and differentiation are not well defined in part due to the lack of tools for forward genetic analysis. We present a piggyBac transposon gain of function screen in human ES cells that identifies DENND2C, which genetically cooperates with NANOG to maintain self-renewal in the presence of retinoic acid. We show that DENND2C negatively regulates RHOA activity, which cooperates with NANOG to block differentiation. It has been recently shown that RHOA exists in the nucleus and is activated by DNA damage; however, its nuclear function remains unknown. We discovered that RHOA associates with DNA and that DENND2C affects nuclear RHOA localization, activity, and DNA association. Our study illustrates the power of piggyBac as a cost-effective, efficient, and easy to use tool for forward genetic screens in human ES cells and provides insight into the role of RHOA in the nucleus.

Abstract: In the present study, we investigated whether celecoxib could induce the expression of NKG2D ligands in clonogenic colon cancer cells, and increase their susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cell death. Celecoxib and its non-coxib analog, 2,5-dimethyl celecoxib, induced ULBP-1 and DR5 in both COX-2 negative HCT-15 cells and COX-2 positive HT-29 cells. Celecoxib increased their susceptibility to NK92 cells in both DELFIA assay and soft agar colony forming assay. The inducibility of ULBP-1 and DR5 by celecoxib was not different between CD44- and CD44+ HCT-15 cells, and CD133- and CD133+ HT-29 cells. Celecoxib increased the susceptibility of highly clonogenic CD44+ HCT-15 and CD133+ HT-29 cells to NK92 cells, at least comparable to less clonogenic CD44- HCT-15 and CD133- HT-29 cells, respectively. In addition, celecoxib induced CHOP, and thapsigargin, an inducer of ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress, induced DR5 but not ULBP1 in HCT-15. Taken together, these findings suggest that celecoxib induces the expression of ULBP-1 as well as DR5 in clonogenic colon cancer cells via COX-2 and ER stress-independent pathways, and increases their susceptibility to NK cells.

Abstract: Summary
During bacterial infections, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signals through the MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways to promote pro-inflammatory and interferon (IFN) responses, respectively. Bacteria can inhibit the MyD88 pathway, but if the TRIF pathway is also targeted is unclear. We demonstrate that, in addition to MyD88, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis inhibits TRIF signaling through the type III secretion system effector YopJ. Suppression of TRIF signaling occurs during dendritic cell (DC) and macrophage infection and prevents expression of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines. YopJ-mediated inhibition of TRIF prevents DCs from inducing natural killer (NK) cell production of antibacterial IFNγ. During infection of DCs, YopJ potently inhibits MAPK pathways but does not prevent activation of IKK- or TBK1-dependent pathways. This singular YopJ activity efficiently inhibits TLR4 transcription-inducing activities, thus illustrating a simple means by which pathogens impede innate immunity.

Abstract: Histone chaperones are an integral part of the transcription regulatory machinery. We investigated the involvement of histone chaperones and their functional interactions with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes in the regulation of yeast heat shock genes. Strong functional interaction between the histone chaperone ASF1 and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF is exhibited in synergistic diminishment of nucleosome displacement during heat shock in the ΔASF1/ΔSNF2 strain in comparison to individual ASF1 or SNF2 inactivation. A similar but less pronounced effect was observed for ISW1/ASF1 inactivation but not for ASF1/STH1 (RSC complex) combinatorial inactivation. The depletion of Spt16, which is a major subunit of the FACT histone chaperone complex, leads to a severe growth defect phenotype associated with unusual thermotolerance. The acquired thermotolerance in the Spt16-depleted strain is associated with a defect in the reassembly of nucleosomes at the promoters of heat shock genes during sustained heat stress, leading to increased recruitment of the transcriptional activator HSF and RNA polymerase II. The defect in nucleosome assembly associated with Spt16 depletion also leads to an increased tolerance to stress due to an increased concentration of NaCl.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) support the growth and differentiation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here we studied the ability of MSCs to support the growth and survival of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in vitro. Primary leukemic blasts isolated from the peripheral blood of 8 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were co-cultured with equal numbers of irradiated MSCs derived from unrelated donor bone marrow, with or without cytokines for up to 6weeks. Four samples showed CD34+CD38− predominance, and four were predominantly CD34+CD38+. CD34+ CD38− predominant leukemia cells maintained the CD34+ CD38− phenotype and were viable for 6weeks when co-cultured with MSCs compared to co-cultures with cytokines or medium only, which showed rapid differentiation and loss of the LSC phenotype. In contrast, CD34+ CD38+ predominant leukemic cells maintained the CD34+CD38+ phenotype when co-cultured with MSCs alone, but no culture conditions supported survival beyond 4weeks. Cell cycle analysis showed that MSCs maintained a higher proportion of CD34+ blasts in G0 than leukemic cells cultured with cytokines. AML blasts maintained in culture with MSCs for up to 6weeks engrafted NSG mice with the same efficiency as their non-cultured counterparts, and the original karyotype persisted after co-culture. Chemosensitivity and transwell assays suggest that MSCs provide pro-survival benefits to leukemic blasts through cell–cell contact. We conclude that MSCs support long-term maintenance of LSCs in vitro. This simple and inexpensive approach will facilitate basic investigation of LSCs and enable screening of novel therapeutic agents targeting LSCs.

Abstract: Nuclear receptor PXR is predominantly expressed in liver and intestine. Expression of PXR is observed to be dysregulated in various metabolic disorders indicating its involvement in disease development. However, information available on mechanisms of PXR self-regulation is fragmentary. The present investigation identifies some of the regulatory elements responsible for its tight regulation and low cellular expression. Here, we report that the PXR-promoter is a target for some key transcription factors like PU.1/Ets-1, Pax5, LEF-1 and c-Jun. Interestingly, we observed that PXR-promoter responsiveness to Pax5, LEF-1 and c-Jun, is considerably enhanced by Ets transcription factors (PU.1 and Ets-1). Co-transfection of cells with Ets-1, LEF-1 and c-Jun increased PXR-promoter activity by 5-fold and also induced expression of endogenous human PXR. Site-directed mutagenesis and transfection studies revealed that two Ets binding sites and two of the three LEF binding sites in the PXR-promoter are functional and have a positive effect on PXR transcription. Results suggest that expression of Ets family members, in conjunction with Pax5, LEF-1 and c-Jun, lead to coordinated up-regulation of PXR gene transcription. Insights obtained on the regulation of PXR gene have relevance in offering important cues towards normal functioning as well as development of several metabolic disorders via PXR signaling.

Abstract: Prior research has investigated the immediate response after application of tensile strain on annulus fibrosus (AF) cells for the past decade. Although mechanical strain can produce either catabolic or anabolic consequences to the cell monolayer, little is known on how to translate these findings into further tissue engineering applications. Till to date, the application and effect of tensile pre-strained cells to construct a three-dimensional (3D) AF tissue remains unknown. This study aims to investigate the effect of tensile pre-strained exposure of 1 to 24h on the development of AF pellet culture for 3 weeks. Equibiaxial cyclic tensile strain was applied on AF monolayer cells over a period of 24h, which was subsequently developed into a cell pellet. Investigation on cellular proliferation, phenotypic gene expression, and histological changes revealed that tensile pre-strain for 24h had significant and lasting effect on the AF tissue development, with enhanced cell proliferation, and up-regulation of collagen type I, II, and aggrecan expression. Our results demonstrated the regenerative ability of AF cell pellets subjected to 24h tensile pre-straining. Knowledge on the effects of tensile pre-strain exposure is necessary to optimize AF development for tissue reconstruction. Moreover, the tensile pre-strained cells may further be utilized in either cell therapy to treat mild disc degeneration disease, or the development of a disc construct for total disc replacement.

Abstract: Prolonged disuse of the musculoskeletal system is associated with reduced mechanical loading and lack of anabolic stimulus. As a form of mechanical signal, the multidirectional orbital fluid shear stress transmits anabolic signal to bone forming cells in promoting cell differentiation, metabolism and proliferation. Signals are channeled through the cytoskeleton framework, directly modifying gene and protein expression. For that reason, we aimed to study the organization of Normal Human Osteoblast (NHOst) cytoskeleton with regards to orbital fluid shear (OFS) stress. Of special interest were the consequences of cytoskeletal reorganization on NHOst metabolism, proliferation, and osteogenic functional markers. Cells stimulated at 250RPM in a shaking incubator resulted in the rearrangement of actin and tubulin fibers after 72h. Orbital shear stress increased NHOst mitochondrial metabolism and proliferation, simultaneously preventing apoptosis. The ratio of RANKL/OPG was reduced, suggesting that orbital shear stress has the potential to inhibit osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity. Increase in ALP activity and OCN protein production suggests that stimulation retained osteoblast function. Shear stress possibly generated through actin seemed to hold an anabolic response as osteoblast metabolism and functional markers were enhanced. We hypothesize that by applying orbital shear stress with suitable magnitude and duration as a non-drug anabolic treatment can help improve bone regeneration in prolonged disuse cases.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the protective effects of adrenomedullin (ADM) on interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced inflammation and apoptosis in rat Leydig cells and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Leydig cells were isolated from adult Sprague–Dawley rats. The cell culture was established by adding ADM 2h prior to 24h treatment with IL-1β-induced cytotoxicity. We detected cell viability and concentrations of testosterone, reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reduced glutathione (GSH). Gene expression levels were measured for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2). Concentrations were detected for nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Apoptosis was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). Levels of gene expression and protein were detected for Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, and poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP). Protein levels were measured for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and IκBα. ADM reduced IL-1β-induced cytotoxicity. ADM pretreatment significantly increased testosterone concentrations and decreased ROS, MDA, and GSH concentrations. ADM pretreatment inhibited IL-1β-induced inflammation in Leydig cells by decreasing the gene expression levels of iNOS and COX-2, as well as the concentrations of NO and PGE2. ADM pretreatment further decreased the number of TUNEL-positive stained Leydig cells, as confirmed by the increase in gene expression and protein levels of Bcl-2 and the decrease of Bax, caspase-3, and PARP levels. Moreover, ADM pretreatment inhibited NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. ADM has potential anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties in IL-1β-induced rat Leydig cells, which might be related to NF-κB signaling pathway.

Lipocalin-2 inhibits osteoclast formation by suppressing the proliferation and differentiation of osteoclast lineage cells,

Abstract: Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is a member of the lipocalin superfamily and plays a critical role in the regulation of various physiological processes, such as inflammation and obesity. In this study, we report that LCN2 negatively modulates the proliferation and differentiation of osteoclast precursors, resulting in impaired osteoclast formation. The overexpression of LCN2 in bone marrow-derived macrophages or the addition of recombinant LCN2 protein inhibits the formation of multinuclear osteoclasts. LCN2 suppresses macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-induced proliferation of osteoclast precursor cells without affecting their apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, LCN2 decreases the expression of the M-CSF receptor, c-Fms, and subsequently blocks its downstream signaling cascades. In addition, LCN2 inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and attenuates the expression of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), which are important modulators in osteoclastogenesis. Mechanistically, LCN2 inhibits NF-κB signaling pathways, as demonstrated by the suppression of IκBα phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of p65, and NF-κB transcriptional activity. Thus, LCN2 is an anti-osteoclastogenic molecule that exerts its effects by retarding the proliferation and differentiation of osteoclast lineage cells.

Abstract: Summary
The bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 suppresses the two-tiered plant innate immune system by injecting a complex repertoire of type III secretion effector (T3E) proteins. Beyond redundancy and interplay, individual T3Es may interact with multiple immunity-associated proteins, rendering their analysis challenging. We constructed a Pst DC3000 polymutant lacking all 36 T3Es and restored individual T3Es or their mutants to explore the interplay among T3Es. The weakly expressed T3E HopAD1 was sufficient to elicit immunity-associated cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana. HopAD1-induced cell death was suppressed partially by native AvrPtoB and completely by AvrPtoBM3, which has mutations disrupting its E3 ubiquitin ligase domain and two known domains for interacting with immunity-associated kinases. AvrPtoBM3 also gained the ability to interact with the immunity-kinase MKK2, which is required for HopAD1-dependent cell death. Thus, AvrPtoB has alternative, competing mechanisms for suppressing effector-triggered plant immunity. This approach allows the deconvolution of individual T3E activities.

Abstract: To investigate the effect of resident cardiac stem cells (RCSC) on myocardial remodeling, c-kit+ RCSC were isolated from hearts of C57Bl/6-Tg (ACTb-EGFP)1Osb/J mice expressing green fluorescent protein and expanded in vitro. C57/Bl6N wildtype mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC, 360μm) or sham-operation. 5×105 c-kit+ RCSC or c-kit− cardiac cells or cell buffer were infused intravenously 24h post-surgery (n=11–24 per group). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-mRNA in left ventricles of TAC mice was enhanced 24h after transplantation. 35days post-TAC, the density of c-kit+ RCSC in the myocardium was increased by two-fold. Infusion of c-kit+ resident cardiac stem cells post-TAC markedly reduced myocardial fibrosis and the expression of collagen Iα2 and connective tissue growth factor. Infusion of c-kit− cardiac cells did not ameliorate cardiac fibrosis. In parallel, expression of pro-angiogenic mediators (FGFb, IL-4, IL-6, TGFß, leptin) and the density of CD31+ and CD31+ GFP+ endothelial cells were increased. Transplantation reduced brain- and atrial natriuretic peptides and the cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. Infusion of c-kit+ resident cardiac stem reduced the rate of apoptosis and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes and in non-cardiomyocyte cells.

Abstract: Summary
Characterization of normal breast stem cells is important for understanding their role in breast development and in breast cancer. However, the identity of these cells is a subject of controversy and their localization in the breast epithelium is not known. In this study, we utilized a novel approach to analyze the morphogenesis of mammary lobules, by combining one-dimensional theoretical models and computer-generated 3D fractals. Comparing predictions of these models with immunohistochemical analysis of tissue sections for candidate stem cell markers, we defined distinct areas where stem cells reside in the mammary lobule. An increased representation of stem cells was found in smaller, less developed lobules compared to larger, more mature lobules, with marked differences in the gland of nulliparous versus parous women and that of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers versus non-carriers.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR/Cas9 protein fused to transactivation domains can be used to control gene expression in human cells. In this study, we demonstrate that a dCas9 fusion with repeats of VP16 activator domains can efficiently activate human genes involved in pluripotency in various cell types. This activator in combination with guide RNAs targeted to the OCT4 promoter can be used to completely replace transgenic OCT4 in human cell reprogramming. Furthermore, we generated a chemically controllable dCas9 activator version by fusion with the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) destabilization domain. Finally, we show that the destabilized dCas9 activator can be used to control human pluripotent stem cell differentiation into endodermal lineages.

Abstract: Summary
We present a non-invasive method to characterize the function of pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes based on video microscopy and image analysis. The platform, called Pulse, generates automated measurements of beating frequency, beat duration, amplitude, and beat-to-beat variation based on motion analysis of phase-contrast images captured at a fast frame rate. Using Pulse, we demonstrate recapitulation of drug effects in stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes without the use of exogenous labels and show that our platform can be used for high-throughput cardiotoxicity drug screening and studying physiologically relevant phenotypes.

Abstract: Integrin receptors connect the extracellular matrix to the cell cytoskeleton to provide essential forces and signals. To examine the contributions of the β1 integrin cytoplasmic tail to adhesive forces, we generated cell lines expressing wild-type and tail mutant β1 integrins in β1-null fibroblasts. Deletion of β1 significantly reduced cell spreading, focal adhesion assembly, and adhesive forces, and expression of human β1 (hβ1) integrin in these cells restored adhesive functions. Cells expressing a truncated tail mutant had impaired spreading, fewer and smaller focal adhesions, reduced integrin binding to fibronectin, and lower adhesion strength and traction forces compared to hβ1-expressing cells. All these metrics were equivalent to those for β1-null cells, demonstrating that the β1 tail is essential to these adhesive functions. Expression of the constitutively-active D759A hβ1 mutant restored many of these adhesive functions in β1-null cells, although with important differences when compared to wild-type β1. Even though there were no differences in integrin-fibronectin binding and adhesion strength between hβ1- and hβ1-D759A-expressing cells, hβ1-D759A-expressing cells assembled more but smaller adhesions than hβ1-expressing cells. Importantly, hβ1-D759A-expressing cells generated lower traction forces compared to hβ1-expressing cells. These differences between hβ1- and hβ1-D759A-expressing cells suggest that regulation of integrin activation is important for fine-tuning cell spreading, focal adhesion assembly, and traction force generation.

Abstract: Hypoxia induces G1 arrest in many cancer cell types. Tumor cells are often exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation, especially under acute hypoxic conditions in vivo. In this study, we investigated cell-cycle kinetics and clonogenic survival after hypoxia/reoxygenation in HeLa cells expressing fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci). Hypoxic treatment halted cell-cycle progression during mid-S to G2 phase, as determined by the cell cycle–regulated E3 ligase activities of SCFSkp2 and APC/CCdh1, which are regulators of the Fucci probes; however, the DNA content of the arrested cells was equivalent to that in G1 phase. After reoxygenation, time-lapse imaging and DNA content analysis revealed that all cells reached G2 phase, and that Fucci fluorescence was distinctly separated into two fractions 24h after reoxygenation: red cells that released from G2 arrest after repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) exhibited higher clonogenic survival, whereas most cells that stayed green contained many DSBs and exhibited lower survival. We conclude that hypoxia disrupts coordination of DNA synthesis and E3 ligase activities associated with cell-cycle progression, and that DSB repair could greatly influence cell-cycle kinetics and clonogenic survival after hypoxia/reoxygenation.

Abstract: Maintenance of genome integrity is critical for proper cell growth. This occurs through accurate DNA replication and repair of DNA lesions. A key factor involved in both DNA replication and the DNA damage response is the heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding complex Replication Protein A (RPA). Although the RPA complex appears to be structurally conserved throughout eukaryotes, the primary amino acid sequence of each subunit can vary considerably. Examination of sequence differences along with the functional interchangeability of orthologous RPA subunits or regions could provide insight into important regions and their functions. This might also allow for study in simpler systems. We determined that substitution of yeast Replication Factor A (RFA) with human RPA does not support yeast cell viability. Exchange of a single yeast RFA subunit with the corresponding human RPA subunit does not function due to lack of inter-species subunit interactions. Substitution of yeast Rfa2 with domains/regions of human Rpa2 important for Rpa2 function (i.e., the N-terminus and the loop 3–4 region) supports viability in yeast cells, and hybrid proteins containing human Rpa2 N-terminal phospho-mutations result in similar DNA damage phenotypes to analogous yeast Rfa2 N-terminal phospho-mutants. Finally, the human Rpa2 N-terminus (NT) fused to yeast Rfa2 is phosphorylated in a manner similar to human Rpa2 in human cells, indicating that conserved kinases recognize the human domain in yeast. The implication is that budding yeast represents a potential model system for studying not only human Rpa2 N-terminal phosphorylation, but also phosphorylation of Rpa2 N-termini from other eukaryotic organisms.

Abstract: Extracellular (ex) HSP60 is increasingly recognized as an agent of cell injury. Previously, we reported that low endotoxin exHSP60 causes cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Our findings supported a role for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in HSP60 mediated apoptosis. To further investigate the involvement of TLR4 in cardiac injury, we studied adult cardiac myocytes from C3H/HeJ (HeJ) mice, which have a mutant, nonfunctional TLR4, and compared the results with parallel studies using wild-type (WT) mice. Nuclear factor κB (NFκB) activation is an early step downstream of TLR4. NFκB was activated 1 h after treatment with HSP60 in WT, but not HeJ mouse myocytes. ExHSP60 caused apoptosis in cardiac myocytes from WT mice, but not in myocytes from the HeJ mutants. To further elucidate the importance of exHSP60 in cardiac myocyte injury, both WT and HeJ mutant isolated mouse adult cardiac myocytes were exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Anti-HSP60 antibody treatment reduced apoptosis in the WT group, but had no effect on the HeJ mutant myocytes. Unexpectedly, necrosis was also decreased in the HeJ mutants. Necrosis after hypoxia/reoxygenation in WT cardiac myocytes was mediated in part by TLR2 and TLR4 through rapid activation of PKCα, followed by increased expression of Nox2, and this was ameliorated by blocking antibodies to TLR2/4. These studies provide further evidence that TLR4 mediates exHSP60-associated apoptosis and that exHSP60 has an important role in cardiac myocyte injury, both apoptotic and necrotic.

Abstract: Helium induces preconditioning in human endothelium protecting against postischemic endothelial dysfunction. Circulating endothelial microparticles are markers of endothelial dysfunction derived in response to injury. Another noble gas, xenon, protected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) against inflammatory stress in vitro. We hypothesised that helium protects the endothelium in vitro against inflammatory and oxidative stress. HUVEC were isolated from fresh umbilical cords and grown upon confluence. Cells were subjected to starving medium for 12h before the experiment and treated for either 3×5min or 1×30min with helium (5% CO2, 25% O2, 70% He) or control gas (5% CO2, 25% O2, 70% N2) in a specialised gas chamber. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with TNF-α (40ng/ml for 24h or 10ng/ml for 2h) or H2O2 (500μM for 2h) or left untreated. Adhesion molecule expression was analysed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Caspase-3 expression and viability of the cells was measured by flowcytometry. Microparticles were investigated by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Helium had no effect on adhesion molecule expression after TNF-α stimulation but in combination with oxidative stress decreased cell viability (68.9±1.3% and 58±1.9%) compared to control. Helium further increased TNF-α induced release of caspase-3 containing particles compared to TNF-α alone (6.4×106±1.1×106 and 2.9×106±0.7×106, respectively). Prolonged exposure of helium increased microparticle formation (2.4×109±0.5×109) compared to control (1.7×109±0.2×109). Summarized, helium increases inflammatory and oxidative stress-induced endothelial damage and is thus not biologically inert. A possible noxious effects on the cellular level causing alterations in microparticle formation both in number and content should be acknowledged.

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in osteoblasts (OBs) is an important regulator of bone formation. We previously described a mouse model expressing Rs1, an engineered constitutively active Gs-coupled GPCR, under the control of the 2.3 kb Col I promoter. These mice showed a dramatic age-dependent increase in trabecular bone of femurs. Here, we further evaluated the effects of enhanced Gs signaling in OBs on intramembranous bone formation by examining calvariae of 1- and 9-week-old Col1(2.3)/Rs1 mice and characterized the in vivo gene expression specifically occurring in osteoblasts with activated Gs G protein-coupled receptor signaling, at the cellular level rather than in a whole bone. Rs1 calvariae displayed a dramatic increase in bone volume with partial loss of cortical structure. By immunohistochemistry, Osterix was detected in cells throughout the inter-trabecular space while Osteocalcin was expressed predominantly in cells along bone surfaces, suggesting the role of paracrine mediators secreted from OBs driven by 2.3 kb Col I promoter could influence early OB commitment, differentiation, and/or proliferation. Gene expression analysis of calvarial OBs revealed that genes affected by Rs1 signaling include those encoding proteins important for cell differentiation, cytokines and growth factors, angiogenesis, coagulation, and energy metabolism. The set of Gs-GPCRs and other GPCRs that may contribute to the observed skeletal phenotype and candidate paracrine mediators of the effect of Gs signaling in OBs were also determined. Our results identify novel detailed in vivo cellular changes of the anabolic response of the skeleton to Gs signaling in mature OBs.

Abstract: The translational potential of cell therapy to humans requires a deep knowledge of the interaction between transplanted cells and host tissues. In this study, we evaluate the behavior of umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs), labeled with fluorescent nanoparticles, transplanted in healthy or early symptomatic transgenic SOD1G93A mice (a murine model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). The double labeling of cells with nanoparticles and Hoechst-33258 enabled their tracking for a long time in both cells and tissues. Whole-body distribution of UC-MSCs was performed by in-vivo and ex-vivo analyses 1, 7, 21days after single intravenous or intracerebroventricular administration. By intravenous administration cells were sequestered by the lungs and rapidly cleared by the liver. No difference in biodistribution was found among the two groups. On the other hand, UC-MSCs transplanted in lateral ventricles remained on the choroid plexus for the whole duration of the study even if decreasing in number. Few cells were found in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice exclusively. No migration in brain parenchyma was observed. These results suggest that the direct implantation in brain ventricles allows a prolonged permanence of cells close to the damaged areas and makes this method of tracking reliable for future studies of efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium vivax malaria is characterized by periodic relapses of symptomatic blood stage parasite infections likely initiated by activation of dormant liver stage parasites—hypnozoites. The lack of tractable P. vivax animal models constitutes an obstacle in examining P. vivax liver stage infection and drug efficacy. To overcome this obstacle, we have used human liver-chimeric (huHep) FRG KO mice as a model for P. vivax infection. FRG KO huHep mice support P. vivax sporozoite infection, liver stage development, and hypnozoite formation. We show complete P. vivax liver stage development, including maturation into infectious exo-erythrocytic merozoites as well as the formation and persistence of hypnozoites. Prophylaxis or treatment with the antimalarial primaquine can prevent and eliminate liver stage infection, respectively. Thus, P. vivax-infected FRG KO huHep mice are a model to investigate liver stage development and dormancy and may facilitate the discovery of drugs targeting relapsing malaria.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiated derivatives of human pluripotent stem cells in culture are generally phenotypically immature compared to their adult counterparts. Their identity is often difficult to determine with certainty because little is known about their human fetal equivalents in vivo. Cellular identity and signaling pathways directing differentiation are usually determined by extrapolating information from either human adult tissue or model organisms, assuming conservation with humans. To resolve this, we generated a collection of human fetal transcriptional profiles at different developmental stages. Moreover, we developed an algorithm, KeyGenes, which uses this dataset to quantify the extent to which next-generation sequencing or microarray data resemble specific cell or tissue types in the human fetus. Using KeyGenes combined with the human fetal atlas, we identified multiple cell and tissue samples unambiguously on a limited set of features. We thus provide a flexible and expandable platform to monitor and evaluate the efficiency of differentiation in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle-degenerative disease caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene. Genetic correction of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by TALENs or CRISPR-Cas9 holds promise for DMD gene therapy; however, the safety of such nuclease treatment must be determined. Using a unique k-mer database, we systematically identified a unique target region that reduces off-target sites. To restore the dystrophin protein, we performed three correction methods (exon skipping, frameshifting, and exon knockin) in DMD-patient-derived iPSCs, and found that exon knockin was the most effective approach. We further investigated the genomic integrity by karyotyping, copy number variation array, and exome sequencing to identify clones with a minimal mutation load. Finally, we differentiated the corrected iPSCs toward skeletal muscle cells and successfully detected the expression of full-length dystrophin protein. These results provide an important framework for developing iPSC-based gene therapy for genetic disorders using programmable nucleases.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinases play important roles in eukaryotic gene expression. CDK7, CDK9 (P-TEFb), and CDK13 are also critical for HIV replication. However, the function of CDK11 remained enigmatic. In this report, we determined that CDK11 regulates the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) of all viral transcripts. CDK11 was found associated with the TREX/THOC, which recruited this kinase to DNA. Once at the viral genome, CDK11 phosphorylated serines at position 2 in the CTD of RNAPII, which increased levels of CPA factors at the HIV 3′ end. In its absence, cleavage of viral transcripts was greatly attenuated. In contrast, higher levels of CDK11 increased the length of HIV poly(A) tails and the stability of mature viral transcripts. We conclude that CDK11 plays a critical role for the cotranscriptional processing of all HIV mRNA species.

Abstract: Wear particle-induced osteolysis and subsequent aseptic loosening remains the most common complication that limits the longevity of prostheses. Wear particle-induced osteoclastogenesis is known to be responsible for extensive bone erosion that leads to prosthesis failure. Thus, inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption may serve as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of wear particle induced osteolysis. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that geraniin, an active natural compound derived from Geranium thunbergii, ameliorated particle-induced osteolysis in a Ti particle-induced mouse calvaria model in vivo. We also investigated the mechanism by which geraniin exerts inhibitory effects on osteoclasts. Geraniin inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in a dose-dependent manner, evidenced by reduced osteoclast formation and suppressed osteoclast specific gene expression. Specially, geraniin inhibited actin ring formation and bone resorption in vitro. Further molecular investigation demonstrated geraniin impaired osteoclast differentiation via the inhibition of the RANKL-induced NF-κB and ERK signaling pathways, as well as suppressed the expression of key osteoclast transcriptional factors NFATc1 and c-Fos. Collectively, our data suggested that geraniin exerts inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation in vitro and suppresses Ti particle-induced osteolysis in vivo. Geraniin is therefore a potential natural compound for the treatment of wear particle induced osteolysis in prostheses failure.

Abstract: Radiotherapy is an essential component of the standard therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. To increase the radiosensitivity of glioma cells is a feasible solution to improve the therapeutic effects. It has been suggested that inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) can radiosensitize glioma cells, probably via the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In this study, human malignant glioma cells, U251 and A172, were treated with an STAT3 inhibitor, WP1066, or a short hairpin RNA plasmid targeting STAT3 to suppress the activation of STAT3 signaling. The radiosensitizing effects of STAT3 inhibition were confirmed in glioma cells. Intriguingly, combination of ionizing radiation exposure and STAT3 inhibition triggered a pronounced increase of autophagy flux. To explore the role of autophagy, glioma cells were treated with 3-methyladenine or siRNA for autophagy-related gene 5, and it was demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy further strengthened the radiosensitizing effects of STAT3 inhibition. Accordingly, more apoptotic cells were induced by the dual inhibition of autophagy and STAT3 signaling. In conclusion, our data revealed a protective role of autophagy in the radiosensitizing effects of STAT3 inhibition, and inhibition of both autophagy and STAT3 might be a potential therapeutic strategy to increase the radiosensitivity of glioma cells.

Abstract: Esophageal cancer is one of the most lethal solid malignancies. Mounting evidence demonstrates that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are able to cause tumor initiation, metastasis and responsible for chemotherapy and radiotherapy failures. As CSCs are thought to be the main reason of therapeutic failure, these cells must be effectively targeted to elicit long-lasting therapeutic responses. We aimed to enrich and identify the esophageal cancer cell subpopulation with stem-like properties and help to develop new target therapy strategies for CSCs. Here, we found esophageal cancer cells KYSE70 and TE1 could form spheres in ultra low attachment surface culture and be serially passaged. Sphere-forming cells could redifferentiate and acquire morphology comparable to parental cells, when return to adherent culture. The sphere-forming cells possessed the key criteria that define CSCs: persistent self-renewal, overexpression of stemness genes (SOX2, ALDH1A1 and KLF4), reduced expression of differentiation marker CK4, chemoresistance, strong invasion and enhanced tumorigenic potential. SB525334, transforming growth factor-beta 1(TGF-β1) inhibitor, significantly inhibited migration and invasion of sphere-forming stem-like cells and had no effect on sphere-forming ability. In conclusion, esophageal cancer sphere-forming cells from KYSE70 and TE1 cultured in ultra low attachment surface possess cancer stem cell properties, providing a model for CSCs targeted therapy. TGF-β1 promotes the migration and invasion of sphere-forming stem-like cells, which may guide future studies on therapeutic strategies targeting these cells.

Abstract: The in vitro differentiation and immunosuppressive capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from synovial fluid (SF-MSCs) and bone marrow extract (BM-MSCs) in an isogenic background of minipigs were comparatively analyzed in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The proliferation capacity and expression of pluripotent transcription factors (Oct3/4 and Sox2) were significantly (P<0.05) higher in SF-MSCs than in BM-MSCs. The differentiation capacity of SF-MSCs into adipocytes, osteocytes and neurocytes was significantly (P<0.05) lower than that of BM-MSCs, and the differentiation capacity of SF-MSCs into chondrocytes was significantly (P<0.05) higher than that of BM-MSCs. Systemic injection of BM- and SF-MSCs significantly (P<0.05) ameliorated the clinical symptoms of CIA mice, with SF-MSCs having significantly (P<0.05) higher clinical and histopathological recovery scores than BM-MSCs. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive properties of SF-MSCs in CIA mice were associated with increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10, and decreased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and osteoclast-related sRANKL. In conclusion, SF-MSCs exhibited eminent pluripotency and differentiation capacity into chondrocytes, addition to substantial in vivo immunosuppressive capacity by elevating IL-10 and reducing IL-1β levels in CIA mice.

Abstract: Fanconi anemia is a genetic bone marrow failure syndrome. The current treatment options are suboptimal and do not prevent the eventual onset of aplastic anemia requiring bone marrow transplantation. We previously showed that resveratrol, an antioxidant and an activator of the protein deacetylase Sirt1, enhanced hematopoiesis in Fancd2 mutant mice and improved the impaired stem cell quiescence observed in this disease. Given that Sirt1 is important for the function of hematopoietic stem cells, we hypothesized that Sirt1 activation may improve hematopoiesis. Indeed, Fancd2−/− mice and wild-type mice treated with the selective Sirt1 activator SRT3025 had increased numbers of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, platelets and white blood cells. SRT3025 was also protective against acetaldehyde-induced hematopoietic damage. Unlike resveratrol, however, SRT3025 did not affect stem cell quiescence, suggesting distinct mechanisms of action. Conditional deletion of Sirt1 in hematopoietic cells did not abrogate the beneficial effects of SRT3025, indicating that the drug did not act by directly stimulating Sirt1 in stem cells, but must be acting indirectly via extra-hematopoietic effects. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis revealed the down-regulation of Egr1–p21 expression, providing a potential mechanism for improved hematopoiesis. Overall, our data indicate that SRT3025 or related compounds may be beneficial in Fanconi anemia and other bone marrow failure syndromes.

Abstract: Fibronectin (FN), an extracellular matrix ligand, plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion, migration, and oncogenic transformation. Aberrant FN expression is associated with poor prognoses in various types of cancer, including breast cancer. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between FN induction and HER2 expression in breast cancer cells. Our results showed that the level of FN expression increased in response to HER family ligands, EGF and TGF-α in a time- and dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, EGF-induced FN expression decreased in response to trastuzumab, which is a HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody. However, EGF-induced FN expression was not affected by trastuzumab in JIMT-1 breast cancer cells, which are trastuzumab insensitive cells. Next, we introduced the HER2 gene into MDA-MB231 cells to verify the relationship between FN and HER2. The level of FN expression significantly increased in HER2-overexpressed MDA-MB231 cells. In contrast, the induction of FN by HER2 was significantly decreased in response to trastuzumab treatment. In addition, the induction of FN by HER2 was down-regulated by the MEK 1/2 specific inhibitor, U0126. Using conditioned culture media of vec- and HER2-overexpressed MDA-MB231 cells, we observed the cell morphology, adhesion, and invasion of MDA-MB231 cells. Interestingly, in conditioned culture media of HER2-overexpressed MDA-MB231 cells, the cell morphology was altered, and adhesion and invasion of MDA-MB231 cells significantly increased. In addition, our results showed that recombinant human FN augmented cell adhesion and invasion of MDA-MB231 cells while these inductions decreased in response to an FN inhibitor. Therefore, we demonstrated that the induction of FN by HER2 triggers cell adhesion and invasion capacities.

Abstract: An acidic tumor microenvironment exists widely in solid tumors. However, the detailed mechanism of cell survival under acidic stress remains unclear. The aim of this study is to clarify whether acid-induced autophagy exists and to determine the function and mechanism of autophagy in lung cancer cells. We have found that acute low pH stimulated autophagy by increasing LC3-positive punctate vesicles, increasing LC3 II expression levels and reducing p62 protein levels. Additionally, autophagy was inhibited by the addition of Baf or knockdown of Beclin 1, and cell apoptosis was increased markedly. In mouse tumors, the expression of cleaved caspase3 and p62 was enhanced by oral treatment with sodium bicarbonate, which can raise the intratumoral pH. Furthermore, the protein levels of ER stress markers, including p-PERK, p-eIF2α, CHOP, XBP-1s and GRP78, were also increased in response to acidic pH. The antioxidant NAC, which reduces ROS accumulation, alleviated acid-mediated ER stress and autophagy, and knocking down GRP78 reduced autophagy activation under acidic conditions, which suggests that autophagy was induced by acidic pH through ER stress. Taken together, these results indicate that the acidic microenvironment in non-small cell lung cancer cells promotes autophagy by increasing ROS-ER stress, which serves as a survival adaption in this setting.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a unique population of multipotent adult progenitor cells originally found in bone marrow (BM), are extremely useful for multifunctional therapeutic approaches. However, the growth arrest and premature senescence of MSCs in vitro prevent the in-depth characterization of these cells. In addition, the regulatory factors involved in MSCs migration remain largely unknown. Given that protein phosphorylation is associated with the processes of MSCs proliferation and migration, we focused on wild-type p53-inducible phosphatase-1 (Wip1), a well-studied modulator of phosphorylation, in this study. Our results showed that Wip1 knockout significantly inhibited MSCs proliferation and induced G2-phase cell-cycle arrest by reducing cyclinB1 expression. Compared with WT-MSCs, Wip1−/− MSCs displayed premature growth arrest after six passages in culture. Transwell and scratch assays revealed that Wip1−/− MSCs migrate more effectively than WT-MSCs. Moreover, the enhanced migratory response of Wip1−/− MSCs may be attributed to increases in the induction of Rac1-GTP activity, the pAKT/AKT ratio, the rearrangement of filamentous-actin (f-actin), and filopodia formation. Based on these results, we then examined the effect of treatment with a PI3K/AKT and Rac1 inhibitor, both of which impaired the migratory activity of MSCs. Therefore, we propose that the PI3K/AKT/Rac1 signaling axis mediates the Wip1 knockout-induced migration of MSCs. Our findings indicate that the principal function of Wip1 in MSCs transformation is the maintenance of proliferative capacity. Nevertheless, knocking out Wip1 increases the migratory capacity of MSCs. This dual effect of Wip1 provides the potential for purposeful routing of MSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The microbial environment impacts many aspects of metazoan physiology through largely undefined molecular mechanisms. The commensal strain Lactobacillus plantarumWJL (LpWJL) sustains Drosophila hormonal signals that coordinate systemic growth and maturation of the fly. Here we examine the underlying mechanisms driving these processes and show that LpWJL promotes intestinal peptidase expression, leading to increased intestinal proteolytic activity, enhanced dietary protein digestion, and increased host amino acid levels. LpWJL-mediated peptidase upregulation is partly driven by the peptidoglycan recognition and signaling cascade PGRP-LE/Imd/Relish. Additionally, this mutualist-mediated physiological benefit is antagonized upon pathogen infection. Pathogen virulence selectively impedes LpWJL-mediated intestinal peptidase activity enhancement and juvenile growth promotion but does not alter growth of germ-free animals. Our study reveals the adaptability of host physiology to the microbial environment, whereby upon acute infection the host switches to pathogen-mediated host immune defense at the expense of mutualist-mediated growth promotion.

Abstract: Detection of cellular stress is of major importance for the survival of cells. During evolution, a network of stress pathways developed, with the heat shock (HS) response playing a major role. The key transcription factor mediating HS signalling activity in mammalian cells is the HS factor HSF1. When activated it binds to the heat shock elements (HSE) in the promoters of target genes like heat shock protein (HSP) genes. They are induced by HSF1 but in addition they integrate multiple signals from different stress pathways. Here, we developed an artificial promoter consisting only of HSEs and therefore selectively reacting to HSF-mediated pathway activation. The promoter is highly inducible but has an extreme low basal level. Direct comparison with the HSPA1A promoter activity indicates that heat-dependent expression can be fully recapitulated by isolated HSEs in human cells. Using this sensitive reporter, we measured the HS response for different temperatures and exposure times. In particular, long heat induction times of 1 or 2 h were compared with short heat durations down to 1 min, conditions typical for burn injuries. We found similar responses to both long and short heat durations but at completely different temperatures. Exposure times of 2 h result in pathway activation at 41 to 44 °C, whereas heat pulses of 1 min lead to a maximum HS response between 47 and 50 °C. The results suggest that the HS response is initiated by a combination of temperature and exposure time but not by a certain threshold temperature.

Abstract: Background
SNARE members mediate membrane fusion during intracellular trafficking underlying innate and adaptive immune responses by different cells. However, little is known about the expression and function of these proteins in human eosinophils, cells involved in allergic, inflammatory and immunoregulatory responses. Here, we investigate the expression and distribution of the Qa-SNARE syntaxin17 (STX17) within human eosinophils isolated from the peripheral blood.
Methods
Flow cytometry and a pre-embedding immunonanogold electron microscopy (EM) technique that combines optimal epitope preservation and secondary Fab-fragments of antibodies linked to 1.4nm gold particles for optimal access to microdomains, were used to investigate STX17.
Results
STX17 was detected within unstimulated eosinophils. Immunogold EM revealed STX17 on secretory granules and on granule-derived vesiculotubular transport carriers (Eosinophil Sombrero Vesicles-EoSVs). Quantitative EM analyses showed that 77.7% of the granules were positive for STX17 with a mean±SEM of 3.9±0.2 gold particles/granule. Labeling was present on both granule outer membranes and matrices while EoSVs showed clear membrane-associated labeling. STX17 was also present in secretory granules in eosinophils stimulated with the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) or the CC-chemokine ligand 11 CCL11 (eotaxin-1), stimuli that induce eosinophil degranulation. The number of secretory granules labeled for STX17 was significantly higher in CCL11 compared with the unstimulated group. The level of cell labeling did not change when unstimulated cells were compared with TNF-α-stimulated eosinophils.
Conclusions
The present study clearly shows by immunanonogold EM that STX17 is localized in eosinophil secretory granules and transport vesicles and might be involved in the transport of granule-derived cargos.

Abstract: Summary
Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by the loss of sensory hair cells and neurons of the inner ear. Once lost, these cell types are not replaced. Two genes expressed in the developing inner ear are c-Myc and Sox2. We created immortalized multipotent otic progenitor (iMOP) cells, a fate-restricted cell type, by transient expression of C-MYC in SOX2-expressing otic progenitor cells. This activated the endogenous C-MYC and amplified existing SOX2-dependent transcripts to promote self-renewal. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that C-MYC and SOX2 occupy over 85% of the same promoters. C-MYC and SOX2 target genes include cyclin-dependent kinases that regulate cell-cycle progression. iMOP cells continually divide but retain the ability to differentiate into functional hair cells and neurons. We propose that SOX2 and C-MYC regulate cell-cycle progression of these cells and that downregulation of C-MYC expression after growth factor withdrawal serves as a molecular switch for differentiation.

Abstract: Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton through actin dynamics is involved in a number of biological processes, but its role in human stromal (skeletal) stem cells (hMSCs) differentiation is poorly understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that stabilizing actin filaments by inhibiting gene expression of the two main actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs): Cofilin 1 (CFL1) and Destrin (DSTN) in hMSCs, enhanced cell viability and differentiation into osteoblastic cells (OB) in vitro, as well as heterotopic bone formation in vivo. Similarly, treating hMSC with Phalloidin, which is known to stabilize polymerized actin filaments, increased hMSCs viability and OB differentiation. Conversely, Cytocholasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, reduced cell viability and inhibited OB differentiation of hMSC. At a molecular level, preventing Cofilin phosphorylation through inhibition of LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) decreased cell viability and impaired OB differentiation of hMSCs. Moreover, depolymerizing actin reduced FAK, p38 and JNK activation during OB differentiation of hMSCs, while polymerizing actin enhanced these signaling pathways. Our results demonstrate that the actin dynamic reassembly and Cofilin phosphorylation loop is involved in the control of hMSC proliferation and osteoblasts differentiation.

Abstract: Background
Acquired resistance to cisplatin treatment is a caveat when treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Ceramide increases in response to chemotherapy, leading to proliferation arrest and apoptosis. However, a tumour stress activation of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) follows to eliminate ceramide by formation of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) such as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), the functional receptor of verotoxin-1. Ceramide elimination enhances cell proliferation and apoptosis blockade, thus stimulating tumor progression. GSLs transactivate multidrug resistance 1/P-glycoprotein (MDR1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) expression which further prevents ceramide accumulation and stimulates drug efflux. We investigated the expression of Gb3, MDR1 and MRP1 in NSCLC and MPM cells with acquired cisplatin resistance, and if GCS activity or MDR1 pump inhibitors would reduce their expression and reverse cisplatin-resistance.
Methods
Cell surface expression of Gb3, MDR1 and MRP1 and intracellular expression of MDR1 and MRP1 was analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy on P31 MPM and H1299 NSCLC cells and subline cells with acquired cisplatin resistance. The effect of GCS inhibitor PPMP and MDR1 pump inhibitor cyclosporin A for 72h on expression and cisplatin cytotoxicity was tested.
Results
The cisplatin-resistant cells expressed increased cell surface Gb3. Cell surface Gb3 expression of resistant cells was annihilated by PPMP whereas cyclosporin A decreased Gb3 and MDR1 expression in H1299 cells. No decrease of MDR1 by PPMP was noted in using flow cytometry, whereas a decrease of MDR1 in H1299 and H1299res was indicated with confocal microscopy. No certain co-localization of Gb3 and MDR1 was noted. PPMP, but not cyclosporin A, potentiated cisplatin cytotoxicity in all cells.
Conclusions
Cell surface Gb3 expression is a likely tumour biomarker for acquired cisplatin resistance of NSCLC and MPM cells. Tumour cell resistance to MDR1 inhibitors of cell surface MDR1 and Gb3 could explain the aggressiveness of NSCLC and MPM. Therapy with GCS activity inhibitors or toxin targeting of the Gb3 receptor may substantially reduce acquired cisplatin drug resistance of NSCLC and MPM cells.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. While surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for early stage CRC, adjuvant chemotherapy is usually given to reduce the risk of recurrence after colectomy. Overexpression of a multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter ABCG2 in vitro has been shown to cause resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and irinotecan, components of the most commonly adopted regimens for treating CRC. Both anticancer drugs are known ABCG2 substrates. An effective way to predict drug response may provide guidance for better cancer treatment. We investigated the effect of ABCG2 dysregulation on cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy using pairs of snap-frozen paraffin-embedded archival blocks of human colorectal cancer tissues and their matched non-cancerous colon tissues from CRC patients. In CRC patients responding to chemotherapy, the tumors were found to have remarkable lower ABCG2 expression than the adjacent normal colon tissues. On the contrary, the tumors from patients not responding to 5-FU-based chemotherapy have higher ABCG2 level than the adjacent normal tissues. The high ABCG2 expression in the tumor is associated with the concomitant overexpression of the mRNA binding protein HuR but a low expression of miR-519c because miR-519c is known to target both ABCG2 and HuR. Further investigation in CRC cell lines revealed that the ABCG2 overexpression was caused by an interplay between miR-519c, HuR and the length of the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of ABCG2. These parameters may be further developed as useful biomarkers to predict patient response to adjuvant chemotherapy. Besides being predictive biomarkers, the microRNAs and mRNA binding protein identified may also be potential drug targets for modulating ABCG2 to combat resistance in CRC chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
In this study, we used patient-specific and isogenic PARK2-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to show that mutations in PARK2 alter neuronal proliferation. The percentage of TH+ neurons was decreased in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patient-derived neurons carrying various mutations in PARK2 compared with an age-matched control subject. This reduction was accompanied by alterations in mitochondrial:cell volume fraction (mitochondrial volume fraction). The same phenotype was confirmed in isogenic PARK2 null lines. The mitochondrial phenotype was also seen in non-midbrain neurons differentiated from the PARK2 null line, as was the functional phenotype of reduced proliferation in culture. Whole genome expression profiling at various stages of differentiation confirmed the mitochondrial phenotype and identified pathways altered by PARK2 dysfunction that include PD-related genes. Our results are consistent with current model of PARK2 function where damaged mitochondria are targeted for degradation via a PARK2/PINK1-mediated mechanism.

Abstract: Hippophae salicifolia (HS) and Hippophae rhamnoides turkestanica (HRT) are abundantly found species of Hippophae in Himalayan region of India. As these plants thrive under extreme climatic conditions, it is suspected that these plants must have a unique adaptogenic property against high-altitude stress. To keeping these views in our mind, the present study was planned to evaluate the mechanism of action of aqueous extract of HS and aqueous extract of HRT against multiple stress [cold-hypoxia-restraint (C-H-R)] for their adaptogenic activity. The present study reported the adaptogenic activity of HS in facilitating tolerance to multiple stress, CHR in rats. Pre-treatment with aqueous extract of HS significantly attenuated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, protein oxidation, and lipid peroxidation and also showed role in maintaining antioxidant status as similar to control rats. Since protein oxidation was decreased by pre-treatment of HS, protein homeostasis was also sustained by regulation of heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSP60). Interestingly, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), and nitric oxide (NO) level was also increased in HS pre-treated rats depicted its adaptogenic activity against multiple stress, CHR. Conclusively, aqueous extract of HS could use an adaptogen for high altitude-associated multiple stress (CHR).

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cells must strictly maintain genomic integrity to prevent transmission of mutations. In human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we found that genome surveillance is achieved via two ways, namely, a hypersensitivity to apoptosis and a very low accumulation of DNA lesions. The low apoptosis threshold was mediated by constitutive p53 expression and a marked upregulation of proapoptotic p53 target genes of the BCL-2 family, ensuring the efficient iPSC removal upon genotoxic insults. Intriguingly, despite the elevated apoptosis sensitivity, both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA lesions induced by genotoxins were less frequent in iPSCs compared to fibroblasts. Gene profiling identified that mRNA expression of several antioxidant proteins was considerably upregulated in iPSCs. Knockdown of glutathione peroxidase-2 and depletion of glutathione impaired protection against DNA lesions. Thus, iPSCs ensure genomic integrity through enhanced apoptosis induction and increased antioxidant defense, contributing to protection against DNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) transplantation is a promising therapeutic strategy for spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the efficacy of NSPC transplantation on severe SCI is poorly understood. We herein show that NSPC transplantation promotes functional recovery after mild and moderate SCI, but not after severe SCI. In severe SCI mice, there were few remaining host neurons within the range of NSPC engraftment; thus, we examined whether the co-distribution of transplant and host is a contributory factor for functional improvement. A cellular selective analysis using laser microdissection revealed that drug-induced host neuronal ablation considerably decreased the synaptogenic potential of the engrafted NSPCs. Furthermore, following host neuronal ablation, neuronal retrograde tracing showed less propriospinal relay connections bridging the lesion after NSPC transplantation. Our findings suggest that the interactive synaptic reorganization between engrafted NSPCs and spared host neurons is crucial for functional recovery, providing significant insight for establishing therapeutic strategies for severe SCI.

Abstract: Neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) express a variety of asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains, called N-glycans, on the cell surface, and mainly produce hybrid-type and complex-type N-glycans. However, the expression profiles and roles of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V (GnT-V), an enzyme that forms β1,6-branched N-glycans, in NPCs remain unknown. In this study, cultured NPCs were prepared from adult or embryo cortex, and were maintained as either proliferating NPCs or differentiated cells in vitro. Analysis using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot and lectin blot revealed that GnT-V and its reaction products were distinctly expressed in proliferating NPCs; moreover expression of GnT-V and its reaction products were markedly diminished in differentiated cells. In brain slices, many GnT-V-positive neurogenic cells were detected throughout the cerebral cortex on embryonic day 13, while only a few doublecortin (Dcx)- and GnT-V-double positive NPCs were detected around the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle in the adult brain. However, in the mice in which motor function was spontaneously recovered after cryoinjury to the motor cortex, many Dcx- and GnT-V-double positive NPCs were found to have accumulated around the brain lesion of the adult cerebral cortex compared with the mice in which the function did not recover. These results indicate that GnT-V expression is under rigorous control during NPC differentiation. Furthermore, expression of GnT-V and its reaction products in NPCs may be necessary for the functional recovery after brain injury, and could be used as a marker for visualization of NPCs.

Abstract: Background and Aims
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an allergic inflammatory disease that leads to esophageal fibrosis and stricture. We have recently shown that in EoE, esophageal epithelial cells undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), characterized by gain of mesenchymal markers and loss of epithelial gene expression. Whether epithelial cells exposed to profibrotic cytokines can also acquire the functional characteristics of activated myofibroblasts, including migration, contraction, and extracellular matrix deposition, is relevant to our understanding and treatment of EoE-associated fibrogenesis. In the current study, we characterize cell migration, contraction, and collagen production by esophageal epithelial cells that have undergone cytokine-induced EMT in vitro.
Methods and Results
Stimulation of human non-transformed immortalized esophageal epithelial cells (EPC2-hTERT) with profibrotic cytokines TNFα, TGFβ, and IL1β for three weeks led to acquisition of mesenchymal αSMA and vimentin, and loss of epithelial E-cadherin expression. Upon removal of the profibrotic stimulus, epithelial characteristics were partially rescued. TGFβ stimulation had a robust effect upon epithelial collagen production. Surprisingly, TNFα stimulation had the most potent effect upon cell migration and contraction, exceeding the effects of the prototypical profibrotic cytokine TGFβ. IL1β stimulation alone had minimal effect upon esophageal epithelial migration, contraction, and collagen production.
Conclusions
Esophageal epithelial cells that have undergone EMT acquire functional characteristics of activated myofibroblasts in vitro. Profibrotic cytokines exert differential effects upon esophageal epithelial cells, underscoring complexities of fibrogenesis in EoE, and implicating esophageal epithelial cells as effector cells in EoE-associated fibrogenesis.

Abstract: Pluripotent stem cells are being actively studied as a cell source for regenerating damaged liver. For long-term survival of engrafting cells in the body, not only do the cells have to execute liver-specific function but also withstand the physical strains and invading pathogens. The cellular innate immune system orchestrated by the interferon (IFN) pathway provides the first line of defense against pathogens. The objective of this study is to assess the innate immune function as well as to systematically profile the IFN-induced genes during hepatic differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. To address this objective, we derived endodermal cells (day 5 post-differentiation), hepatoblast (day 15) and hepatocyte-like cells (day 21) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Day 5, 15 and 21 cells were stimulated with IFN-α and subjected to IFN pathway analysis. Transcriptome analysis was carried out by RNA sequencing. The results showed that the IFN-α treatment activated STAT–JAK pathway in differentiating cells. Transcriptome analysis indicated stage specific expression of classical and non-classical IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Subsequent validation confirmed the expression of novel ISGs including RASGRP3, CLMP and TRANK1 by differentiated hepatic cells upon IFN treatment. Hepatitis C virus replication in hESC-derived hepatic cells induced the expression of ISGs — LAMP3, ETV7, RASGRP3, and TRANK1. The hESC-derived hepatic cells contain intact innate system and can recognize invading pathogens. Besides assessing the tissue-specific functions for cell therapy applications, it may also be important to test the innate immune function of engrafting cells to ensure adequate defense against infections and improve graft survival.

Abstract: Histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) has been used to increase the reprogramming efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) from somatic cells, yet the specific molecular mechanisms underlying this effect is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that reprogramming with lentiviruses carrying the iPSC-inducing factors (Oct4-Sox2-Klf4-cMyc, OSKM) caused senescence in mouse fibroblasts, establishing a stress barrier for cell reprogramming. Administration of VPA protected cells from reprogramming-induced senescent stress. Using an in vitro pre-mature senescence model, we found that VPA treatment increased cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis through the suppression of the p16/p21 pathway. In addition, VPA also inhibited the G2/M phase blockage derived from the senescence stress. These findings highlight the role of VPA in breaking the cell senescence barrier required for the induction of pluripotency.

Abstract: The molecular mechanism of kidney aging is not well understood, but the abnormal expression of miRNAs with aging is considered to be an important contributor. miR-184 and miR-150 were screened using a miRNA microarray and qRT-PCR and found to be significantly upregulated in 24-month-old rats. Rat renal primary glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) were isolated from 3-month and 24-month-old rats for the in vitro analysis of the roles of miR-184 and miR-150 in kidney aging. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that Rab1a and Rab31, which are associated with cell autophagy, were targeted by both miR-184 and miR-150. miR-184 and miR-150 were increased significantly in aging GMCs versus young cells, while Rab1a and Rab31 were significantly lower in aging cells. Furthermore, dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-184 and miR-150 bound to the 3ʹ-UTR of Rab1a and Rab31 mRNAs. Transfection of miR-184 and miR-150 mimics into young GMCs suppressed the expression of Rab1a and Rab31. Transfected cells showed lower autophagy activities and higher levels of cellular oxidative products, leading to the aging of young GMCs. However, miR-184 and miR-150 inhibitors promoted autophagy and reduced oxidative damage by upregulating Rab1a and Rab31 in old GMCs. In conclusion, miR-184 and miR-150 inhibited autophagy, promoting GMC aging.

Abstract: As a widely used anti-bacterial agent and a metabolic inhibitor as well as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator, berberine (BBR) has been shown to cross the blood–brain barrier. Its efficacy has been investigated in various disease models of the central nervous system. Neurite outgrowth is critical for nervous system development and is a highly energy-dependent process regulated by AMPK-related pathways. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of BBR on AMPK activation and neurite outgrowth in neurons. The neurite outgrowth of primary rat cortical neurons at different stages of polarization was monitored after exposure of BBR. Intracellular energy level, AMPK activation and polarity-related pathways were also inspected. The results showed that BBR suppressed neurite outgrowth and affected cytoskeleton stability in the early stages of neuronal polarization, which was mediated by lowered energy status and AMPK activation. Liver kinase B1 and PI3K–Akt–GSK3β signaling pathways were also involved. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress contributed to the lowered energy status induced by BBR. This study highlighted the knowledge of the complex activities of BBR in neurons and corroborated the significance of energy status during the neuronal polarization.

Abstract: Background
Fibrotic diseases encompass numerous systemic and organ-specific disorders characterized by the development and persistence of myofibroblasts. TGFβ1 is considered the key inducer of fibrosis and drives myofibroblast differentiation in cells of diverse histological origin by a pro-oxidant shift in redox homeostasis associated with decreased nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signaling. Thus, enhancement of NO/cGMP represents a potential therapeutic strategy to target myofibroblast activation and therefore fibrosis.
Methods
Myofibroblast differentiation was induced by TGFβ1 in human primary prostatic (PrSCs) and normal dermal stromal cells (NDSCs) and monitored by α smooth muscle cell actin (SMA) and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) mRNA and protein levels. The potential of enhanced cGMP production by the sGC stimulator BAY 41-2272 or the sGC activator BAY 60-2770 to inhibit and revert myofibroblast differentiation in vitro was analyzed. Moreover, potential synergisms of BAY 41-2272 or BAY 60-2770 and inhibition of cGMP degradation by the PDE5 inhibitor vardenafil were investigated.
Results
BAY 41-2272 and BAY 60-2770 at doses of 30µM significantly inhibited induction of SMA and IGFBP3 levels in PrSCs and reduced myofibroblast marker levels in TGFβ1-predifferentiated cells. At lower concentrations (3 and 10µM) only BAY 41-2272 but not BAY 60-2770 significantly inhibited and reverted myofibroblast differentiation. In NDSCs both substances significantly inhibited differentiation at all concentrations tested. Attenuation of SMA expression was more pronounced in NDSCs whereas reduction of IGFBP3 levels by BAY 41-2272 appeared more efficient in PrSCs. Moreover, administration of BAY 41-2272 or BAY 60-2770 enhanced the efficiency of the PDE5 inhibitor vardenafil to inhibit and revert myofibroblast differentiation in vitro.
Conclusions
Increase of cGMP by sGC stimulation/activation significantly inhibited and reverted myofibroblast differentiation. This effect was even more pronounced when a combination treatment with a PDE5 inhibitor was applied. Thus, enhancement of NO/cGMP-signaling by sGC stimulation/activation is a promising strategy for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. Whereas, in NDSCs BAY 60-2770 and BAY 41-2272 exerted similar effects on myofibroblast differentiation, higher potency of BAY 41-2272 was observed in PrSCs, indicating phenotypical differences between fibroblasts form different organs that should be taken into account in the search for antifibrotic therapies.

Abstract: Summary
We present self-cloning CRISPR/Cas9 (scCRISPR), a technology that allows for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic mutation and site-specific knockin transgene creation within several hours by circumventing the need to clone a site-specific single-guide RNA (sgRNA) or knockin homology construct for each target locus. We introduce a self-cleaving palindromic sgRNA plasmid and a short double-stranded DNA sequence encoding the desired locus-specific sgRNA into target cells, allowing them to produce a locus-specific sgRNA plasmid through homologous recombination. scCRISPR enables efficient generation of gene knockouts (∼88% mutation rate) at approximately one-sixth the cost of plasmid-based sgRNA construction with only 2 hr of preparation for each targeted site. Additionally, we demonstrate efficient site-specific knockin of GFP transgenes without any plasmid cloning or genome-integrated selection cassette in mouse and human embryonic stem cells (2%–4% knockin rate) through PCR-based addition of short homology arms. scCRISPR substantially lowers the bar on mouse and human transgenesis.

Abstract: Summary
We utilized induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from Huntington’s disease (HD) patients as a human model of HD and determined that the disease phenotypes only manifest in the differentiated neural stem cell (NSC) stage, not in iPSCs. To understand the molecular basis for the CAG repeat expansion-dependent disease phenotypes in NSCs, we performed transcriptomic analysis of HD iPSCs and HD NSCs compared to isogenic controls. Differential gene expression and pathway analysis pointed to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and netrin-1 as the top dysregulated pathways. Using data-driven gene coexpression network analysis, we identified seven distinct coexpression modules and focused on two that were correlated with changes in gene expression due to the CAG expansion. Our HD NSC model revealed the dysregulation of genes involved in neuronal development and the formation of the dorsal striatum. The striatal and neuronal networks disrupted could be modulated to correct HD phenotypes and provide therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) into insoluble aggregates occurs in several related disorders collectively referred to as synucleinopathies. To date, studies have used neural stem cells (NSCs) to examine questions about α-syn propagation, but have overlooked the therapeutic potential of NSC transplantation to modulate cognition in disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson’s disease dementia. Here, we show that striatal transplantation of NSCs into aged α-syn transgenic mice significantly improves performance in multiple cognitive and motor domains. This recovery is associated with NSC expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which restores depleted levels and modulates dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. Most importantly, transplantation of BDNF-depleted NSCs fails to improve behavior, whereas AAV-mediated BDNF delivery mimics the benefits of NSC transplantation, supporting a critical role for this neurotrophin in functional improvement. Thus, NSC transplantation could offer a promising approach to treat the understudied yet devastating cognitive components of many synucleinopathies.

Abstract: Glioblastoma cells exhibit highly invasive behavior whose mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The present study explores the relationship between the invasion capacity of 5 glioblastoma cell lines differing in p53 and PTEN status, expression of mTOR and several other marker proteins involved in cell invasion, actin cytoskeleton organization and cell morphology. We found that two glioblastoma lines mutated in both p53 and PTEN genes (U373-MG and SNB19) exhibited the highest invasion rates through the Matrigel or collagen matrix. In DK-MG (p53wt/PTENwt) and GaMG (p53mut/PTENwt) cells, F-actin mainly occurred in the numerous stress fibers spanning the cytoplasm, whereas U87-MG (p53wt/PTENmut), U373-MG and SNB19 (both p53mut/PTENmut) cells preferentially expressed F-actin in filopodia and lamellipodia. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the abundant filopodia and lamellipodia in the PTEN mutated cell lines. Interestingly, the gene profiling analysis revealed two clusters of cell lines, corresponding to the most (U373-MG and SNB19, i.e. p53 and PTEN mutated cells) and less invasive phenotypes. The results of this study might shed new light on the mechanisms of glioblastoma invasion.

Abstract: To meet the need of a large quantity of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CM) for pre-clinical and clinical studies, a robust and scalable differentiation system for CM production is essential. With a human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) aggregate suspension culture system we established previously, we developed a matrix-free, scalable, and GMP-compliant process for directing hPSC differentiation to CM in suspension culture by modulating Wnt pathways with small molecules. By optimizing critical process parameters including: cell aggregate size, small molecule concentrations, induction timing, and agitation rate, we were able to consistently differentiate hPSCs to >90% CM purity with an average yield of 1.5 to 2×109 CM/L at scales up to 1L spinner flasks. CM generated from the suspension culture displayed typical genetic, morphological, and electrophysiological cardiac cell characteristics. This suspension culture system allows seamless transition from hPSC expansion to CM differentiation in a continuous suspension culture. It not only provides a cost and labor effective scalable process for large scale CM production, but also provides a bioreactor prototype for automation of cell manufacturing, which will accelerate the advance of hPSC research towards therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Despite its wide use as a first-line therapeutic agent, gemcitabine has shown limited efficacy in advanced pancreatic cancer due to chemoresistance by as yet unidentified mechanisms. Our goal here was to identify molecular features involved in gemcitabine chemoresistance. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key enzyme of aerobic glycolysis, has recently emerged as an important therapeutic target for cancer treatment. It is involved in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells and has previously unexpected non-metabolic functions that are heavily involved in tumor growth and survival. Herein, we report that the chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine was dependent on PKM2 expression and its non-metabolic function. Knocking-down of PKM2 significantly enhanced gemcitabine-induced cell apoptosis through the activation of caspase 3/7 and PARP cleavage, and this inhibitory activity was associated with p38-mediated activation of p53 phosphorylation at serine 46. Our findings support the potential of PKM2 as a novel target for gemcitabine chemoresistance and suggest the feasibility of combining gemcitabine and PKM2 inhibition for the improved chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: A major challenge to the study and treatment of neurogenetic syndromes is accessing live neurons for study from affected individuals. Although several sources of stem cells are currently available, acquiring these involve invasive procedures, may be difficult or expensive to generate and are limited in number. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are multipotent stem cells that reside deep the pulp of shed teeth. To investigate the characteristics of DPSCs that make them a valuable resource for translational research, we performed a set of viability, senescence, immortalization and gene expression studies on control DPSC and derived neurons. We investigated the basic transport conditions and maximum passage number for primary DPSCs. We immortalized control DPSCs using human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and evaluated neuronal differentiation potential and global gene expression changes by RNA-seq. We show that neurons from immortalized DPSCs share morphological and electrophysiological properties with non-immortalized DPSCs. We also show that differentiation of DPSCs into neurons significantly alters gene expression for 1305 transcripts. Here we show that these changes in gene expression are concurrent with changes in protein levels of the transcriptional repressor REST/NRSF, which is known to be involved in neuronal differentiation. Immortalization significantly altered the expression of 183 genes after neuronal differentiation, 94 of which also changed during differentiation. Our studies indicate that viable DPSCs can be obtained from teeth stored for ≥72h, these can then be immortalized and still produce functional neurons for in vitro studies, but that constitutive hTERT immortalization is not be the best approach for long term use of patient derived DPSCs for the study of disease.

Abstract: Invadopodia are actin-rich protrusions formed by mesenchymally migrating cancer cells. They are mainly composed of actin, actin-associated proteins, integrins and proteins of signaling machineries. These protrusions display focalized proteolytic activity towards the extracellular matrix. It is well known that polymerized (F-)actin is present in these structures, but the nature of the actin isoform has not been studied before. We here show that both cytoplasmic actin isoforms, β- and γ-actin, are present in the invadopodia of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells cultured on a 2D-surface, where they colocalize with the invadopodial marker cortactin. Invadopodial structures formed by the cells in a 3D-collagen matrix also contain β- and γ-actin. We demonstrate this using isoform-specific antibodies and expression of fluorescently-tagged actin isoforms. Additionally, using simultaneous expression of differentially tagged β- and γ-actin in cells, we show that the actin isoforms are present together in a single invadopodium. Cells with an increased level of β- or γ-actin, display a similar increase in the number and size of invadopodia in comparison to control cells. Moreover, increasing the level of either actin isoforms also increases invasion velocity.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota is central to human health, but its establishment in early life has not been quantitatively and functionally examined. Applying metagenomic analysis on fecal samples from a large cohort of Swedish infants and their mothers, we characterized the gut microbiome during the first year of life and assessed the impact of mode of delivery and feeding on its establishment. In contrast to vaginally delivered infants, the gut microbiota of infants delivered by C-section showed significantly less resemblance to their mothers. Nutrition had a major impact on early microbiota composition and function, with cessation of breast-feeding, rather than introduction of solid food, being required for maturation into an adult-like microbiota. Microbiota composition and ecological network had distinctive features at each sampled stage, in accordance with functional maturation of the microbiome. Our findings establish a framework for understanding the interplay between the gut microbiome and the human body in early life.

Abstract: The effect of transplantation dose on the spatiotemporal dynamics of human neural stem cell (hNSC) engraftment has not been quantitatively evaluated in the central nervous system. We investigated changes over time in engraftment/survival, proliferation, and migration of multipotent human central nervous system-derived neural stem cells (hCNS-SCns) transplanted at doses ranging from 10,000 to 500,000 cells in spinal cord injured immunodeficient mice. Transplant dose was inversely correlated with measures of donor cell proliferation at 2weeks post-transplant (WPT) and dose-normalized engraftment at 16 WPT. Critically, mice receiving the highest cell dose exhibited an engraftment plateau, in which the total number of engrafted human cells never exceeded the initial dose. These data suggest that donor cell expansion was inversely regulated by target niche parameters and/or transplantation density. Investigation of the response of donor cells to the host microenvironment should be a key variable in defining target cell dose in pre-clinical models of CNS disease and injury.

Abstract: Summary
Adult stem cells and tumor-initiating cells (TICs) often employ different mechanisms of DNA damage response (DDR) as compared to other tissue cell types. However, little is known about how mammary stem cells (MaSCs) and mammary TICs respond to DNA damage. Using the mouse mammary gland and syngeneic p53-null tumors as models, we investigated the molecular and physiological consequences of DNA damage in wild-type MaSCs, p53-null MaSCs, and p53-null TICs. We showed that wild-type MaSCs and basal cells are more resistant to apoptosis and exhibit increased non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity. Loss of p53 in mammary epithelium affected both cell-cycle regulation and DNA repair efficiency. In p53-null tumors, we showed that TICs are more resistant to ionizing radiation (IR) due to decreased apoptosis, elevated NHEJ activity, and more-rapid DNA repair. These results have important implications for understanding DDR mechanisms involved in both tumorigenesis and therapy resistance.

Abstract: Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is a protein associated with prolonged life expectancy. We investigated whether life extension is associated with cardioprotection against hypoxia. The proposed study is to develop approaches to reduce hypoxic damage through the use of the sirtuin pathway and to elucidate the mechanism involved. For that purpose we subjected cardiomyocytes from transgenic mice (TG) with over-expression of SIRT6, to hypoxic stress in cell cultures. We hypothesized that cardiomyocytes from transgenic mice subjected to prolonged hypoxia may release survival factors or fewer damage markers to protect them from hypoxic stress compared with wild type (WT) mice. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) released to the medium and propidium iodide (PI) binding, were markedly decreased following hypoxia in TG cardiomyocytes. The protective mechanism of SIRT6 over-expression includes the activation of pAMPKα pathway, the increased protein level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB), the decrease of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reduction in the protein level of phospho-protein kinase B (pAkt) during hypoxia. Together, all these processes impede the necrosis/apoptosis pathways leading to the improved survival of cardiomyocytes following hypoxia, which might explain life extension.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC-CMs) can improve the contractility of injured hearts. We hypothesized that mesodermal cardiovascular progenitors (hESC-CVPs), capable of generating vascular cells in addition to cardiomyocytes, would provide superior repair by contributing to multiple components of myocardium. We performed a head-to-head comparison of hESC-CMs and hESC-CVPs and compared these with the most commonly used clinical cell type, human bone marrow mononuclear cells (hBM-MNCs). In a nude rat model of myocardial infarction, hESC-CMs and hESC-CVPs generated comparable grafts. Both similarly improved systolic function and ventricular dilation. Furthermore, only rare human vessels formed from hESC-CVPs. hBM-MNCs attenuated ventricular dilation and enhanced host vascularization without engrafting long-term or improving contractility. Thus, hESC-CMs and CVPs show similar efficacy for cardiac repair, and both are more efficient than hBM-MNCs. However, hESC-CVPs do not form larger grafts or more significant numbers of human vessels in the infarcted heart.

Abstract: Intracellular signaling pathways present targets for pharmacological agents with potential for treatment of neoplastic diseases, with some disease remissions already recorded. However, cellular compensatory mechanisms usually negate the initial success. For instance, attempts to interrupt aberrant signaling downstream of the frequently mutated ras by inhibiting ERK1/2 has shown only limited usefulness for cancer therapy. Here, we examined how ERK5, that overlaps the functions of ERK1/2 in cell proliferation and survival, functions in a manner distinct from ERK1/2 in human AML cells induced to differentiate by 1,25D-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D). Using inhibitors of ERK1/2 and of MEK5/ERK5 at concentrations specific for each kinase in HL60 and U937 cells, we observed that selective inhibition of the kinase activity of ERK5, but not of ERK1/2, in the presence of 1,25D resulted in macrophage-like cell morphology and enhancement of phagocytic activity. Importantly, this was associated with increased expression of the macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR), but was not seen when M-CSFR expression was knocked down. Interestingly, inhibition of ERK1/2 led to activation of ERK5 in these cells. Our results support the hypothesis that ERK5 negatively regulates the expression of M-CSFR, and thus has a restraining function on macrophage differentiation. The addition of pharmacological inhibitors of ERK5 may influence trials of differentiation therapy of AML.

Abstract: Summary
Tbx3, a member of the T-box family, plays important roles in development, stem cells, nuclear reprogramming, and cancer. Loss of Tbx3 induces differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, we show that mESCs exist in an alternate stable pluripotent state in the absence of Tbx3. In-depth transcriptome analysis of this mESC state reveals Dppa3 as a direct downstream target of Tbx3. Also, Tbx3 facilitates the cell fate transition from pluripotent cells to mesoderm progenitors by directly repressing Wnt pathway members required for differentiation. Wnt signaling regulates differentiation of mESCs into mesoderm progenitors and helps to maintain a naive pluripotent state. We show that Tbx3, a downstream target of Wnt signaling, fine tunes these divergent roles of Wnt signaling in mESCs. In conclusion, we identify a signaling-TF axis that controls the exit of mESCs from a self-renewing pluripotent state toward mesoderm differentiation.

Abstract: Compelling evidence indicates that suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) plays a pivotal regulatory role in inflammation. However, the function of SOCS3 in inflammatory responses mediated by Fcγ receptor (FcγR) remains largely unknown. In the current study, we found that SOCS3 expression was greatly enhanced in peritoneal macrophages treated with IgG immune complex (IgG IC). By over-expressing SOCS3 in macrophages, we observed that SOCS3 promoted IgG immune complex-induced production of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, TNF-α, MIP-2, and MIP-1α. In contrast, SOCS3-defective peritoneal macrophages generated less inflammatory cytokines and chemokines when compared with their wild type counterparts during IgG IC-induced inflammatory responses. We further demonstrated that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) δ transcription factor was the major downstream target of SOCS3 in macrophages. These data suggested that SOCS3 was an inflammatory enhancer in IgG IC-treated macrophages by increasing C/EBPδ activity. To elucidate the role for myeloid-derived SOCS3 in IgG IC-induced inflammation in vivo, LysM-cre SOCS3fl/fl mice lacking SOCS3 in macrophages and neutrophils were generated. We found that SOCS3 deficiency greatly alleviated IgG IC-induced generation of pro-inflammatory mediators in lungs, consistent with the in vitro data. Our current findings may provide a new theoretical basis for designing drugs for treatment of IgG IC-associated diseases.

Abstract: Recent innovations in cell biology and imaging approaches are changing the way we study cellular stress, protein misfolding, and aggregation. Studies have begun to show that stress responses are even more variegated and dynamic than previously thought, encompassing nano-scale reorganization of cytosolic machinery that occurs almost instantaneously, much faster than transcriptional responses. Moreover, protein and mRNA quality control is often organized into highly dynamic macromolecular assemblies, or dynamic droplets, which could easily be mistaken for dysfunctional “aggregates,” but which are, in fact, regulated functional compartments. The nano-scale architecture of stress-response ranges from diffraction-limited structures like stress granules, P-bodies, and stress foci to slightly larger quality control inclusions like juxta nuclear quality control compartment (JUNQ) and insoluble protein deposit compartment (IPOD), as well as others. Examining the biochemical and physical properties of these dynamic structures necessitates live cell imaging at high spatial and temporal resolution, and techniques to make quantitative measurements with respect to movement, localization, and mobility. Hence, it is important to note some of the most recent observations, while casting an eye towards new imaging approaches that offer the possibility of collecting entirely new kinds of data from living cells.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LD) are spherical cellular inclusion devoted to lipids storage. It is well known that excessive accumulation of lipids leads to several human worldwide diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis. LDs' size range from fraction to one hundred of micrometers in adipocytes and is related to the lipid content, but their growth is still a puzzling question. It has been suggested that LDs can grow in size due to the fusion process by which a larger LD is obtained by the merging of two smaller LDs, but these events seems to be rare and difficult to be observed. Many other processes are thought to be involved in the number and growth of LDs, like the de novo formation and the growth through additional neutral lipid deposition in pre-existing droplets. Moreover the number and size of LDs are influenced by the catabolism and the absorption or interaction with other organelles. The comprehension of these processes could help in the confinement of the pathologies related to lipid accumulation. In this study the LDs' size distribution, number and the total volume of immature (n=12), mature (n=12, 10-days differentiated) and lipolytic (n=12) 3T3-L1 adipocytes were considered. More than 11,000 LDs were measured in the 36 cells after Oil Red O staining. In a previous work Monte Carlo simulations were used to mimic the fusion process alone between LDs. We found that, considering the fusion as the only process acting on the LDs, the size distribution in mature adipocytes can be obtained with numerical simulation starting from the size distribution in immature cells provided a very high rate of fusion events. In this paper Monte Carlo simulations were developed to mimic the interaction between LDs taking into account many other processes in addition to fusion (de novo formation and the growth through additional neutral lipid deposition in pre-existing droplets) in order to reproduce the LDs growth and we also simulated the catabolism (fission and the decrease through neutral lipid exit from pre-existing droplets) to reproduce their size reduction observed in lipolytic conditions. The results suggest that each single process, considered alone, can not be considered the only responsible for the size variation observed, but more than one of them, playing together, can quite well reproduce the experimental data.

Abstract: For non-invasive stem cells tracking through MRI, it is important to understand the efficiency of in vitro labeling of stem cells with iron oxide with regard to its relaxation behavior. In this study, we have carried out a pilot study of labeling mice mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) entrapped with poly-L-lysine (PLL) in different ratios and incubated with different times. Our results demonstrated that 50:1.5µg/ml of iron oxide and PLL at an incubation time of 6h with 10% serum concentration are sufficient enough for effective labeling. Optimized labeling showed that >98% of viability and <3% toxicity were observed at a total iron content of 11.8pg/cell. In vitro relaxometry study showed that almost a 6.6 fold reduction in transverse relaxation time (T2) was observed after labeling as compared to unlabeled. IO-PLL complex was more effective than iron oxide alone in labeling and a detectable lower limit found to be hundred with optimized concentration. Significant increase in Oct-4 expression on day-3 after labeling was observed, whereas CD146 expression remains unchanged in real time RT-PCR. This optimized labeling method of MSCs may be very useful for cellular MRI and stem cells tracking studies.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by numerous abnormal blood vessels, which rapidly proliferate and invade brain tissue and express different angiogenic factors. In this study we have investigated whether the expression levels of CD31/ PECAM1 are deregulated in human GBM tissue specimens and we have also correlated the expression levels of CD31/PECAM1 with those of HIF-1α. Finally, we have established a correlation between the expression levels of CD31/PECAM1 and HIF-1α, and those of two other biomarkers, namely N-cadherin and ADAM-10, of aggressiveness in the same tumors. Results have shown an increased expression of CD31/PECAM1 correlated to HIF-1α expression, confirming evidence demonstrating that different types of tumor are able to trigger aberrant angiogenesis through HIF-1α. Moreover, we also established a further correlation among CD31/PECAM1 and HIF-1α and N-cadherin and ADAM-10, two other markers of aggressiveness in the same tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The collection sites of human primary tissue samples and the receiving laboratories, where the human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs) are derived, are often not on the same site. Thus, the stability of samples prior to derivation constrains the distance between the collection site and the receiving laboratory. To investigate sample stability, we collected blood and held it at room temperature for 5, 24, or 48 hr before isolating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and reprogramming into IPSCs. Additionally, PBMC samples at 5- and 48-hr time points were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 4 months and reprogrammed into IPSCs. hIPSC lines derived from all time points were pluripotent, displayed no marked difference in chromosomal aberration rates, and differentiated into three germ layers. Reprogramming efficiency at 24- and 48-hr time points was 3- and 10-fold lower, respectively, than at 5 hr; the freeze-thaw process of PBMCs resulted in no obvious change in reprogramming efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Invading viral DNA can be recognized by the host cytosolic DNA sensor, cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), resulting in production of the second messenger cGAMP, which directs the adaptor protein STING to stimulate production of type I interferons (IFNs). Although several DNA viruses are sensed by cGAS, viral strategies targeting cGAS are virtually unknown. We report here that Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF52, an abundant gammaherpesvirus-specific tegument protein, subverts cytosolic DNA sensing by directly inhibiting cGAS enzymatic activity through a mechanism involving both cGAS binding and DNA binding. Moreover, ORF52 homologs in other gammaherpesviruses also inhibit cGAS activity and similarly bind cGAS and DNA, suggesting conserved inhibitory mechanisms. Furthermore, KSHV infection evokes cGAS-dependent responses that can limit the infection, and an ORF52 null mutant exhibits increased cGAS signaling. Our findings reveal a mechanism through which gammaherpesviruses antagonize host cGAS DNA sensing.

Abstract: Chaperone Hsp70 can cross the plasma membrane of living cells using mechanisms that so far have not received much research attention. Searching the part of the molecule that is responsible for transport ability of Hsp70, we found a cationic sequence composed of 20 amino acid residues on its surface, KST peptide, which was used in further experiments. We showed that KST peptide enters living cells of various origins with the same efficiency as the full-length chaperone. KST peptide is capable of carrying cargo with a molecular weight 30 times greater than its own into cells. When we compared the membrane-crossing activity of KST peptide in complex with Avidin (KST–Av complex) with that of similarly linked canonical TAT peptide, we found that TAT peptide penetrated SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells at a similar rate and efficiency as the KST peptide. Furthermore, KST peptide can carry protein complexes consisting of a specific antibody coupled to the peptide through the Avidin bridge. An antibody to Hsp70 delivered to SK-N-SH cells with high expression level of Hsp70 reduced the protective power of the chaperone and sensitized the cells to the pro-apoptotic effect of staurosporine. We studied the mechanisms of penetration of KST–Av and full-length Hsp70 inside human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH and human erythroleukemia K-562 cells and found that both used an active intracellular transport mechanism that included vesicular structures and negatively charged lipid membrane domains. Competition analysis of intracellular transport showed that the chaperone reduced intracellular penetration of KST peptide and conversely KST peptide prevented Hsp70 transport in a dose-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Prior efforts to identify regulators of hematopoietic stem cell physiology have relied mainly on candidate gene approaches with genetically modified mice. Here we used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) strategy with the hybrid mouse diversity panel to identify the genetic determinants of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) frequency. Among 108 strains, we observed ∼120- to 300-fold variation in three HSPC populations. A GWAS analysis identified several loci that were significantly associated with HSPC frequency, including a locus on chromosome 5 harboring the homeodomain-only protein gene (Hopx). Hopx previously had been implicated in cardiac development but was not known to influence HSPC biology. Analysis of the HSPC pool in Hopx−/− mice demonstrated significantly reduced cell frequencies and impaired engraftment in competitive repopulation assays, thus providing functional validation of this positional candidate gene. These results demonstrate the power of GWAS in mice to identify genetic determinants of the hematopoietic system.

Abstract: Summary
Degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) is associated with cognitive impairments of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), implying that BFCNs hold potentials in exploring stem cell-based replacement therapy for AD. However, studies on derivation of BFCNs from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are limited, and the application of ESC-derived BFCNs remains to be determined. Here, we report on differentiation approaches for directing both mouse and human ESCs into mature BFCNs. These ESC-derived BFCNs exhibit features similar to those of their in vivo counterparts and acquire appropriate functional properties. After transplantation into the basal forebrain of AD model mice, ESC-derived BFCN progenitors predominantly differentiate into mature cholinergic neurons that functionally integrate into the endogenous basal forebrain cholinergic projection system. The AD mice grafted with mouse or human BFCNs exhibit improvements in learning and memory performances. Our findings suggest a promising perspective of ESC-derived BFCNs in the development of stem cell-based therapies for treatment of AD.

Abstract: Summary
Epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from epiblasts of postimplantation mouse embryos, and thus provide a useful model for studying “primed” pluripotent states. Here, we devised a simple and robust technique to derive high-quality EpiSCs using an inhibitor of WNT secretion. Using this method, we readily established EpiSC lines with high efficiency and were able to use whole embryonic portions without having to separate the epiblast from the visceral endoderm (VE). Expression analyses revealed that these EpiSCs maintained a homogeneous, undifferentiated status, yet showed high potential for differentiation both in vitro and in teratomas. Unlike EpiSCs derived by the original protocol, new EpiSC lines required continuous treatment with the Wnt inhibitor, suggesting some intrinsic differences from the existing EpiSCs. The homogeneous properties of this new version of EpiSCs should facilitate studies on the establishment and maintenance of a “primed” pluripotent state, and directed differentiation from the primed state.

Abstract: Lymphangiogenesis, the formation of new lymph vessels, plays a significant role in the development and metastasis of various cancers. We and others have demonstrated that low molecular weight hyaluronan (LMW-HA) promotes lymphangiogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. In this study, using immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that LMW-HA increased the colocalization of lymphatic vessel endothelial HA receptor (LYVE-1) and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P3) at the cell surface. Silencing of either LYVE-1 or S1P3 decreased LMW-HA-mediated tube formation in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Furthermore, silencing of either LYVE-1 or S1P3 significantly inhibited LMW-HA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Src kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). In summary, these results suggest that S1P3 and LYVE-1 may cooperate to play a role in LMW-HA-mediated lymphangiogenesis. This interaction may provide a useful target for the intervention of lymphangiogenesis-associated tumor progression.

Abstract: Molecular intervention during transient stages of various metastatic pathways may lead to development of promising therapeutic technologies. One of such involves soluble fibrin (sFn) that has been implicated as a cross-linker between circulating blood or tumor cells and endothelial cell receptors, promoting cell arrest on the endothelium during circulation. sFn generation is a result of thrombin-mediated fibrinogen (Fg) cleavage due to either vascular injuries or a tumor microenvironment. For cancer therapy, thrombin-mediated conversions of Fg to sFn thus serve as potential intervention points to decrease circulating tumor cell adhesion to the endothelium and subsequent metastatic events. The purpose of this work was to investigate the function of an anti-thrombin oligonucleotide aptamer in reducing tumor cell arrest. Both molecular and cellular interactions were examined to demonstrate the binding and inhibitory effects of anti-thrombin aptamer. The results show that the aptamer is capable of inhibiting thrombin-mediated Fg conversion, thereby reducing sFn-mediated tumor cell adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, the aptamer is able to bind thrombin under dynamic flow conditions and reduce tumor cell adhesive events at various physiological shear rates. This study further indicates that oligonucleotide aptamers hold great promise as therapeutic regulators of tumor cell adhesion, and consequently, metastatic activity.

Abstract: Social stressors evolving from individual and population interactions produce stress reactions in many organisms (including humans), influencing homeostasis, altering the activity of the immunological system, and thus leading to various pathological states including cancer and their progression. The present study sought to validate the effectiveness of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in cancer promotion and to assess oxidative stress outcomes in terms of various in vivo biochemical parameters, oxidative stress markers, DNA damage, and the development of skin tumors in Swiss albino mice. Animals were randomized into different groups based on their exposure to CUS alone, 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) alone (topical), and DMBA-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (topical) and exposure to CUS prior to DMBA or DMBA-TPA treatments and sacrificed after 16 weeks of treatment. Prior exposure to CUS significantly increased the pro-oxidant effect of carcinogen, depicted by compromised levels of antioxidants in the circulation and skin, accompanied by enhanced lipid peroxidation, plasma corticosterone, and marker enzymes as compared to DMBA-alone or DMBA-TPA treatments. DNA damage results corroborated the above biochemical outcomes. Also, the development of skin tumors (in terms of their incidence, tumor yield, and tumor burden) in mice in the presence and absence of stress further strongly supported our above biochemical measurements. CUS may work as a promoter of carcinogenesis by enhancing the pro-oxidant potential of carcinogens. Further studies may be aimed at the development of interventions for disease prevention by identifying the relations between psychological factors and DNA damage.

Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by excessive proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and increased migration of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). We hypothesized that quercetin exerts protective effects against this disease; thus, a chronic hypoxia model of PAH was generated using male Sprague-Dawley rats, which were treated with quercetin. In this model, quercetin prevented the development of PAH, right ventricular hypertrophy, and vascular remodeling after exposure to hypoxia. Quercetin inhibited PASMC proliferation and increased the apoptosis of PASMCs in vivo. In vitro, quercetin significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced PASMC proliferation, arrested cells in G1/G0 and inhibited cell migration in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, our results showed that quercetin increased cyclin D1 protein levels and decreased the protein expression of cyclin B1 and Cdc2. Additionally, quercetin altered the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and reduced MMP2, MMP9, CXCR4, integrin β1, and integrin α5 expression. Using genome-wide microarray analysis, we found that factors regulating proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and migration were related to the tyrosine receptor kinase A (TrkA) pathway. In addition, activation of the TrkA/AKT signaling cascade during hypoxia was inhibited by quercetin in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, quercetin alone inhibited the TrkA/AKT signaling pathway, resulting in decreased PASMC migration, cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis. Our data suggest that quercetin is a potential candidate for the treatment of hypoxia-induced PAH.

Abstract: Migfilin is a novel cell–matrix adhesion protein known to interact with Vasodilator Stimulated Phosphoprotein (VASP) and be localized both at cell–matrix and cell–cell adhesions. To date there is nothing known about its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As matrix is important in metastasis, we aimed to investigate the Migfilin׳s role in HCC metastasis using two human HCC cell lines that differ in their metastatic potential; non-invasive Alexander cells and the highly invasive HepG2 cells. We silenced Migfilin by siRNA and studied its effect on signaling and metastasis-related cellular properties. We show that Migfilin׳s expression is elevated in HepG2 cells and its silencing leads to upregulation of actin reorganization-related proteins, namely phosphor-VASP (Ser157 and Ser239), Fascin-1 and Rho-kinase-1, promoting actin polymerization and inhibiting cell invasion. Phosphor-Akt (Ser473) is decreased contributing to the upregulation of free and phosphor-β-catenin (Ser33/37Thr41) and inducing proliferation. Migfilin elimination upregulates Extracellular Signal–regulated kinase, which increases cell adhesion in HepG2 and reduces invasiveness. This is the first study to reveal that Migfilin inhibition can halt HCC metastasis in vitro, providing the molecular mechanism involved and presenting Migfilin as potential therapeutic target against HCC metastasis.

Abstract: Extracellular Ca2+ can promote dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) expression and odontoblastic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Gap junctions mediated by connexin43 (Cx43) allow diffusion of small molecules (such as Ca2+) among cells to regulate cell-to-cell communications. However, it is unclear whether Cx43 is required for the Ca2+-induced cell differentiation. Here, we found that the influx of extracellular Ca2+ through L-type Ca2+ channels increases intracellular free Ca2+ levels to promote DSPP expression. Cx43 overexpression potentiated the extracellular Ca2+-induced DSPP expression via Erk1/2. Flow cytometry analyses showed that Cx43 increased the percentage of p-Erk1/2 positive cells in response to Ca2+, indicating that Cx43 in DPSCs possibly acts as a traditional gap junction channel, which permits the sharing of signals among coupled cells to make more DPSCs respond to Ca2+. Furthermore, inhibition of Cx43 function and gap junction communication decreased Ca2+-induced the expression of DSPP, suggesting that cell-to-cell contacts are required for Cx43 to promote the Ca2+-induced cell differentiation. Similarly, the study performed on DPSCs cultured at low-density and high-density revealed that intercellular contacts are required to potentiate Erk1/2 activity and DSPP expression. In total, this study indicates that Cx43 increases Ca2+-induced DSPP expression and odontoblastic differentiation of DPSCs via Erk1/2 through gap junction-mediated cell-to-cell contacts.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanisms responsible for nephrogenic stem cell preservation and commitment is fundamental to harnessing the potential of the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) for nephron regeneration. Accordingly, we established a culture model that preferentially expands the MM SIX2+ progenitor pool using leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a Rho kinase inhibitor (ROCKi), and extracellular matrix. Passaged MM cells express the key stem cell regulators Six2 and Pax2 and remain competent to respond to WNT4 induction and form mature tubular epithelia and glomeruli. Mechanistically, LIF activates STAT, which binds to a Stat consensus sequence in the Six2 proximal promoter and sustains SIX2 levels. ROCKi, on the other hand, attenuates the LIF-induced differentiation activity of JNK. Concomitantly, the combination of LIF/ROCKi upregulates Slug expression and activates YAP, which maintains SIX2, PAX2, and SALL1. Using this novel model, our study underscores the pivotal roles of SIX2 and YAP in MM stem cell stability.

Abstract: Summary
Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are major virulence mechanisms in many Gram-negative bacteria, but the physiological signals that activate them are not well understood. The T6SS1 of Burkholderia pseudomallei is essential for pathogenesis in mammalian hosts and is only expressed when the bacterium is intracellular. We found that signals for T6SS1 activation reside in the host cytosol. Through site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical studies, we identified low molecular weight thiols, particularly glutathione, as the signal sensed by a periplasmic cysteine residue (C62) on the histidine kinase sensor VirA. Upon glutathione exposure, dimeric VirA is converted to monomers via reduction at C62. When glutathione in the host was depleted, T6SS1 expression was abrogated, and bacteria could no longer induce multinucleate giant cell formation, the hallmark of T6SS1 function. Therefore, intracellular bacteria exploit the abundance of glutathione in host cytosol as a signal for expression of virulence at the appropriate time and place.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal progenitors are initially found in the anterior neural plate region known as the eye field, whereas neighboring areas undertake telencephalic or hypothalamic development. Eye field cells become specified by switching on a network of eye field transcription factors, but the extracellular cues activating this network remain unclear. In this study, we used chemically defined media to induce in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) toward eye field fates. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling was sufficient to drive ESCs to telencephalic, but not retinal, fates. Instead, retinal progenitors could be generated from competent differentiating mouse ESCs by activation of Activin/Nodal signaling within a narrow temporal window corresponding to the emergence of primitive anterior neural progenitors. Activin also promoted eye field gene expression in differentiating human ESCs. Our results reveal insights into the mechanisms of eye field specification and open new avenues toward the generation of retinal progenitors for translational medicine.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has created promising new avenues for therapies in regenerative medicine. However, the tumorigenic potential of undifferentiated iPSCs is a major safety concern for clinical translation. To address this issue, we demonstrated the efficacy of suicide gene therapy by introducing inducible caspase-9 (iC9) into iPSCs. Activation of iC9 with a specific chemical inducer of dimerization (CID) initiates a caspase cascade that eliminates iPSCs and tumors originated from iPSCs. We introduced this iC9/CID safeguard system into a previously reported iPSC-derived, rejuvenated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (rejCTL) therapy model and confirmed that we can generate rejCTLs from iPSCs expressing high levels of iC9 without disturbing antigen-specific killing activity. iC9-expressing rejCTLs exert antitumor effects in vivo. The system efficiently and safely induces apoptosis in these rejCTLs. These results unite to suggest that the iC9/CID safeguard system is a promising tool for future iPSC-mediated approaches to clinical therapy.
