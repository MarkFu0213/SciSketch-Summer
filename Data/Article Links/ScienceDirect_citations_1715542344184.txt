Abstract: Summary
The stability of eukaryotic mRNAs is dependent on a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex of poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPC1/Pab1) organized on the poly(A) tail. This poly(A) RNP not only protects mRNAs from premature degradation but also stimulates the Pan2-Pan3 deadenylase complex to catalyze the first step of poly(A) tail shortening. We reconstituted this process in vitro using recombinant proteins and show that Pan2-Pan3 associates with and degrades poly(A) RNPs containing two or more Pab1 molecules. The cryo-EM structure of Pan2-Pan3 in complex with a poly(A) RNP composed of 90 adenosines and three Pab1 protomers shows how the oligomerization interfaces of Pab1 are recognized by conserved features of the deadenylase and thread the poly(A) RNA substrate into the nuclease active site. The structure reveals the basis for the periodic repeating architecture at the 3′ end of cytoplasmic mRNAs. This illustrates mechanistically how RNA-bound Pab1 oligomers act as rulers for poly(A) tail length over the mRNAs’ lifetime.

Abstract: Summary
Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses that cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease in humans. Herein, we present a 2.2 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of Mxra8 and 4 to 5 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of Mxra8 bound to chikungunya (CHIKV) virus-like particles and infectious virus. The Mxra8 ectodomain contains two strand-swapped Ig-like domains oriented in a unique disulfide-linked head-to-head arrangement. Mxra8 binds by wedging into a cleft created by two adjacent CHIKV E2-E1 heterodimers in one trimeric spike and engaging a neighboring spike. Two binding modes are observed with the fully mature VLP, with one Mxra8 binding with unique contacts. Only the high-affinity binding mode was observed in the complex with infectious CHIKV, as viral maturation and E3 occupancy appear to influence receptor binding-site usage. Our studies provide insight into how Mxra8 binds CHIKV and creates a path for developing alphavirus entry inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Necrosis of infected macrophages constitutes a critical pathogenetic event in tuberculosis by releasing mycobacteria into the growth-permissive extracellular environment. In zebrafish infected with Mycobacterium marinum or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, excess tumor necrosis factor triggers programmed necrosis of infected macrophages through the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the participation of cyclophilin D, a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Here, we show that this necrosis pathway is not mitochondrion-intrinsic but results from an inter-organellar circuit initiating and culminating in the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ROS induce production of lysosomal ceramide that ultimately activates the cytosolic protein BAX. BAX promotes calcium flow from the endoplasmic reticulum into the mitochondrion through ryanodine receptors, and the resultant mitochondrial calcium overload triggers cyclophilin-D-mediated necrosis. We identify ryanodine receptors and plasma membrane L-type calcium channels as druggable targets to intercept mitochondrial calcium overload and necrosis of mycobacterium-infected zebrafish and human macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
TLR8 is among the highest-expressed pattern-recognition receptors in the human myeloid compartment, yet its mode of action is poorly understood. TLR8 engages two distinct ligand binding sites to sense RNA degradation products, although it remains unclear how these ligands are formed in cellulo in the context of complex RNA molecule sensing. Here, we identified the lysosomal endoribonuclease RNase T2 as a non-redundant upstream component of TLR8-dependent RNA recognition. RNase T2 activity is required for rendering complex single-stranded, exogenous RNA molecules detectable for TLR8. This is due to RNase T2’s preferential cleavage of single-stranded RNA molecules between purine and uridine residues, which critically contributes to the supply of catabolic uridine and the generation of purine-2′,3′-cyclophosphate-terminated oligoribonucleotides. Thus-generated molecules constitute agonistic ligands for the first and second binding pocket of TLR8. Together, these results establish the identity and origin of the RNA-derived molecular pattern sensed by TLR8.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids recapitulate developmental processes and tissue architecture, but intrinsic limitations, such as lack of vasculature and functionality, have greatly hampered their application. Here we establish a versatile protocol for generating vascularized three-dimensional (3D) kidney organoids. We employ dynamic modulation of WNT signaling to control the relative proportion of proximal versus distal nephron segments, producing a correlative level of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) to define a resident vascular network. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies a subset of nephron progenitor cells as a potential source of renal vasculature. These kidney organoids undergo further structural and functional maturation upon implantation. Using this kidney organoid platform, we establish an in vitro model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), the cystic phenotype of which can be effectively prevented by gene correction or drug treatment. Our studies provide new avenues for studying human kidney development, modeling disease pathogenesis, and performing patient-specific drug validation.

Abstract: Summary
Most human protein-coding genes are regulated by multiple, distinct promoters, suggesting that the choice of promoter is as important as its level of transcriptional activity. However, while a global change in transcription is recognized as a defining feature of cancer, the contribution of alternative promoters still remains largely unexplored. Here, we infer active promoters using RNA-seq data from 18,468 cancer and normal samples, demonstrating that alternative promoters are a major contributor to context-specific regulation of transcription. We find that promoters are deregulated across tissues, cancer types, and patients, affecting known cancer genes and novel candidates. For genes with independently regulated promoters, we demonstrate that promoter activity provides a more accurate predictor of patient survival than gene expression. Our study suggests that a dynamic landscape of active promoters shapes the cancer transcriptome, opening new diagnostic avenues and opportunities to further explore the interplay of regulatory mechanisms with transcriptional aberrations in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The processing of RNA transcripts from mammalian genes occurs in proximity to their transcription. Here, we describe a phenomenon affecting thousands of genes that we call exon-mediated activation of transcription starts (EMATS), in which the splicing of internal exons impacts promoter choice and the expression level of the gene. We observed that evolutionary gain of internal exons is associated with gain of new transcription start sites (TSSs) nearby and increased gene expression. Inhibiting exon splicing reduced transcription from nearby promoters, and creation of new spliced exons activated transcription from cryptic promoters. The strongest effects occurred for weak promoters located proximal and upstream of efficiently spliced exons. Together, our findings support a model in which splicing recruits transcription machinery locally to influence TSS choice and identify exon gain, loss, and regulatory change as major contributors to the evolution of alternative promoters and gene expression in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are a component of the tumor microenvironment and have been predominantly associated with cancer progression. Using a genetic approach complemented by adoptive transfer, we found that neutrophils are essential for resistance against primary 3-methylcholantrene-induced carcinogenesis. Neutrophils were essential for the activation of an interferon-γ-dependent pathway of immune resistance, associated with polarization of a subset of CD4− CD8− unconventional αβ T cells (UTCαβ). Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses unveiled the innate-like features and diversity of UTCαβ associated with neutrophil-dependent anti-sarcoma immunity. In selected human tumors, including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, CSF3R expression, a neutrophil signature and neutrophil infiltration were associated with a type 1 immune response and better clinical outcome. Thus, neutrophils driving UTCαβ polarization and type 1 immunity are essential for resistance against murine sarcomas and selected human tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Human neural stem cell cultures provide progenitor cells that are potential cells of origin for brain cancers. However, the extent to which genetic predisposition to tumor formation can be faithfully captured in stem cell lines is uncertain. Here, we evaluated neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells, representative of cerebellar progenitors. We transduced NES cells with MYCN, observing medulloblastoma upon orthotopic implantation in mice. Significantly, transcriptomes and patterns of DNA methylation from xenograft tumors were globally more representative of human medulloblastoma compared to a MYCN-driven genetically engineered mouse model. Orthotopic transplantation of NES cells generated from Gorlin syndrome patients, who are predisposed to medulloblastoma due to germline-mutated PTCH1, also generated medulloblastoma. We engineered candidate cooperating mutations in Gorlin NES cells, with mutation of DDX3X or loss of GSE1 both accelerating tumorigenesis. These findings demonstrate that human NES cells provide a potent experimental resource for dissecting genetic causation in medulloblastoma.

Abstract: Summary
Peptidoglycan (PG) is a defining feature of bacteria, involved in cell division, shape, and integrity. We previously reported that several genes related to PG biosynthesis were horizontally transferred from bacteria to the nuclear genome of mealybugs. Mealybugs are notable for containing a nested bacteria-within-bacterium endosymbiotic structure in specialized insect cells, where one bacterium, Moranella, lives in the cytoplasm of another bacterium, Tremblaya. Here we show that horizontally transferred genes on the mealybug genome work together with genes retained on the Moranella genome to produce a PG layer exclusively at the Moranella cell periphery. Furthermore, we show that an insect protein encoded by a horizontally transferred gene of bacterial origin is transported into the Moranella cytoplasm. These results provide a striking parallel to the genetic and biochemical mosaicism found in organelles, and prove that multiple horizontally transferred genes can become integrated into a functional pathway distributed between animal and bacterial endosymbiont genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Physiology and metabolism are often sexually dimorphic, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we use the intestine of Drosophila melanogaster to investigate how gut-derived signals contribute to sex differences in whole-body physiology. We find that carbohydrate handling is male-biased in a specific portion of the intestine. In contrast to known sexual dimorphisms in invertebrates, the sex differences in intestinal carbohydrate metabolism are extrinsically controlled by the adjacent male gonad, which activates JAK-STAT signaling in enterocytes within this intestinal portion. Sex reversal experiments establish roles for this male-biased intestinal metabolic state in controlling food intake and sperm production through gut-derived citrate. Our work uncovers a male gonad-gut axis coupling diet and sperm production, revealing that metabolic communication across organs is physiologically important. The instructive role of citrate in inter-organ communication might be significant in more biological contexts than previously recognized.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed risk alleles for ulcerative colitis (UC). To understand their cell type specificities and pathways of action, we generate an atlas of 366,650 cells from the colon mucosa of 18 UC patients and 12 healthy individuals, revealing 51 epithelial, stromal, and immune cell subsets, including BEST4+ enterocytes, microfold-like cells, and IL13RA2+IL11+ inflammatory fibroblasts, which we associate with resistance to anti-TNF treatment. Inflammatory fibroblasts, inflammatory monocytes, microfold-like cells, and T cells that co-express CD8 and IL-17 expand with disease, forming intercellular interaction hubs. Many UC risk genes are cell type specific and co-regulated within relatively few gene modules, suggesting convergence onto limited sets of cell types and pathways. Using this observation, we nominate and infer functions for specific risk genes across GWAS loci. Our work provides a framework for interrogating complex human diseases and mapping risk variants to cell types and pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon-gamma (IFNG) augments immune function yet promotes T cell exhaustion through PDL1. How these opposing effects are integrated to impact immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is unclear. We show that while inhibiting tumor IFNG signaling decreases interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in cancer cells, it increases ISGs in immune cells by enhancing IFNG produced by exhausted T cells (TEX). In tumors with favorable antigenicity, these TEX mediate rejection. In tumors with neoantigen or MHC-I loss, TEX instead utilize IFNG to drive maturation of innate immune cells, including a PD1+TRAIL+ ILC1 population. By disabling an inhibitory circuit impacting PD1 and TRAIL, blocking tumor IFNG signaling promotes innate immune killing. Thus, interferon signaling in cancer cells and immune cells oppose each other to establish a regulatory relationship that limits both adaptive and innate immune killing. In melanoma and lung cancer patients, perturbation of this relationship is associated with ICB response independent of tumor mutational burden.

Abstract: Summary
We have previously developed a high-throughput bioengineered human cardiac organoid (hCO) platform, which provides functional contractile tissue with biological properties similar to native heart tissue, including mature, cell-cycle-arrested cardiomyocytes. In this study, we perform functional screening of 105 small molecules with pro-regenerative potential. Our findings reveal surprising discordance between our hCO system and traditional 2D assays. In addition, functional analyses uncovered detrimental effects of many hit compounds. Two pro-proliferative small molecules without detrimental impacts on cardiac function were identified. High-throughput proteomics in hCO revealed synergistic activation of the mevalonate pathway and a cell-cycle network by the pro-proliferative compounds. Cell-cycle reentry in hCO and in vivo required the mevalonate pathway as inhibition of the mevalonate pathway with a statin attenuated pro-proliferative effects. This study highlights the utility of human cardiac organoids for pro-regenerative drug development, including identification of underlying biological mechanisms and minimization of adverse side effects.

Abstract: Summary
Diverse genetic, epigenetic, and developmental programs drive glioblastoma, an incurable and poorly understood tumor, but their precise characterization remains challenging. Here, we use an integrative approach spanning single-cell RNA-sequencing of 28 tumors, bulk genetic and expression analysis of 401 specimens from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), functional approaches, and single-cell lineage tracing to derive a unified model of cellular states and genetic diversity in glioblastoma. We find that malignant cells in glioblastoma exist in four main cellular states that recapitulate distinct neural cell types, are influenced by the tumor microenvironment, and exhibit plasticity. The relative frequency of cells in each state varies between glioblastoma samples and is influenced by copy number amplifications of the CDK4, EGFR, and PDGFRA loci and by mutations in the NF1 locus, which each favor a defined state. Our work provides a blueprint for glioblastoma, integrating the malignant cell programs, their plasticity, and their modulation by genetic drivers.

Abstract: Summary
While knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is critical for understanding virus-host relationships, limitations on the scalability of high-throughput methods have hampered their identification beyond a number of well-studied viruses. Here, we implement an in silico computational framework (pathogen host interactome prediction using structure similarity [P-HIPSTer]) that employs structural information to predict ∼282,000 pan viral-human PPIs with an experimental validation rate of ∼76%. In addition to rediscovering known biology, P-HIPSTer has yielded a series of new findings: the discovery of shared and unique machinery employed across human-infecting viruses, a likely role for ZIKV-ESR1 interactions in modulating viral replication, the identification of PPIs that discriminate between human papilloma viruses (HPVs) with high and low oncogenic potential, and a structure-enabled history of evolutionary selective pressure imposed on the human proteome. Further, P-HIPSTer enables discovery of previously unappreciated cellular circuits that act on human-infecting viruses and provides insight into experimentally intractable viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) originates in a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transformed by the breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-abelson (ABL) oncogene and is effectively treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). TKIs do not eliminate disease-propagating leukemic stem cells (LSCs), suggesting a deeper understanding of niche-dependent regulation of CML LSCs is required to eradicate disease. Cxcl12 is expressed in bone marrow niches and controls HSC maintenance, and here, we show that targeted deletion of Cxcl12 from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) reduces normal HSC numbers but promotes LSC expansion by increasing self-renewing cell divisions, possibly through enhanced Ezh2 activity. In contrast, endothelial cell-specific Cxcl12 deletion decreases LSC proliferation, suggesting niche-specific effects. During CML development, abnormal clusters of colocalized MSCs and LSCs form but disappear upon Cxcl12 deletion. Moreover, MSC-specific deletion of Cxcl12 increases LSC elimination by TKI treatment. These findings highlight a critical role of niche-specific effects of Cxcl12 expression in maintaining quiescence of TKI-resistant LSC populations.

Abstract: Summary
Following injury, differentiated epithelial cells can serve as a stem cell-independent source for tissue regeneration by undergoing reprogramming into other cell types. The intrinsic molecular basis underlying plasticity of differentiated cells remains largely unaddressed. Here we show that Arid1a, a key component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, controls liver regeneration and gene expression associated with emergence of injury-induced liver-progenitor-like cells (LPLCs). Hepatocyte-specific Arid1a ablation reduces LPLC gene expression in several models of periportal liver injury and impairs liver regeneration, leading to organ dysfunction. Arid1a establishes a permissive chromatin state at LPLC-enriched genes during homeostasis, suggesting it endows hepatocytes with competence to respond to injury-induced signals. Consistently, Arid1a facilitates binding of YAP, a critical regeneration signaling pathway, to LPLC-enriched genes, and Arid1a deletion prevents their YAP-associated induction following injury. Together, these findings provide a framework for studying the contributions of injury-induced LPLCs to periportal liver regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) are a chemoresistant population that can drive tumor growth and relapse, but the lack of BTSC-specific markers prevents selective targeting that spares resident stem cells. Through a ribosome-profiling analysis of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) and BTSCs, we find glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) expression specifically in BTSCs and not in NSCs. GPD1 expression is present in the dormant BTSC population, which is enriched at tumor borders and drives tumor relapse after chemotherapy. GPD1 inhibition prolongs survival in mouse models of glioblastoma in part through altering cellular metabolism and protein translation, compromising BTSC maintenance. Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses confirm that GPD1+ BTSCs have a profile distinct from that of NSCs, which is dependent on GPD1 expression. Similar GPD1 expression patterns and prognostic associations are observed in human gliomas. This study provides an attractive therapeutic target for treating brain tumors and new insights into mechanisms regulating BTSC dormancy.

Abstract: Summary
Directed evolution, artificial selection toward designed objectives, is routinely used to develop new molecular tools and therapeutics. Successful directed molecular evolution campaigns repeatedly test diverse sequences with a designed selective pressure. Unicellular organisms and their viral pathogens are exceptional for this purpose and have been used for decades. However, many desirable targets of directed evolution perform poorly or unnaturally in unicellular backgrounds. Here, we present a system for facile directed evolution in mammalian cells. Using the RNA alphavirus Sindbis as a vector for heredity and diversity, we achieved 24-h selection cycles surpassing 10−3 mutations per base. Selection is achieved through genetically actuated sequences internal to the host cell, thus the system’s name: viral evolution of genetically actuating sequences, or “VEGAS.” Using VEGAS, we evolve transcription factors, GPCRs, and allosteric nanobodies toward functional signaling endpoints each in less than 1 weeks’ time.

Abstract: Summary
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) proteins are essential for sterol homeostasis, believed to drive sterol integration into the lysosomal membrane before redistribution to other cellular membranes. Here, using a combination of crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and biochemical and in vivo studies on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NPC system (NCR1 and NPC2), we present a framework for sterol membrane integration. Sterols are transferred between hydrophobic pockets of vacuolar NPC2 and membrane-protein NCR1. NCR1 has its N-terminal domain (NTD) positioned to deliver a sterol to a tunnel connecting NTD to the luminal membrane leaflet 50 Å away. A sterol is caught inside this tunnel during transport, and a proton-relay network of charged residues in the transmembrane region is linked to this tunnel supporting a proton-driven transport mechanism. We propose a model for sterol integration that clarifies the role of NPC proteins in this essential eukaryotic pathway and that rationalizes mutations in patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C.

Abstract: Summary
The CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) balances immunity and tolerance by homeostatic trafficking of immune cells. In cancer, CCR7-mediated trafficking leads to lymph node metastasis, suggesting the receptor as a promising therapeutic target. Here, we present the crystal structure of human CCR7 fused to the protein Sialidase NanA by using data up to 2.1 Å resolution. The structure shows the ligand Cmp2105 bound to an intracellular allosteric binding pocket. A sulfonamide group, characteristic for various chemokine receptor ligands, binds to a patch of conserved residues in the Gi protein binding region between transmembrane helix 7 and helix 8. We demonstrate how structural data can be used in combination with a compound repository and automated thermal stability screening to identify and modulate allosteric chemokine receptor antagonists. We detect both novel (CS-1 and CS-2) and clinically relevant (CXCR1-CXCR2 phase-II antagonist Navarixin) CCR7 modulators with implications for multi-target strategies against cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The Zika epidemic in the Americas has challenged surveillance and control. As the epidemic appears to be waning, it is unclear whether transmission is still ongoing, which is exacerbated by discrepancies in reporting. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases to identify transmission not captured by reporting. We uncovered an unreported outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring islands. By sequencing Zika virus, we show that the establishment of the virus was delayed by a year and that the ensuing outbreak was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that, although mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, such measures need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be “silently” spreading and provides a framework for understanding outbreak dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Long-distance RNA transport enables local protein synthesis at metabolically-active sites distant from the nucleus. This process ensures an appropriate spatial organization of proteins, vital to polarized cells such as neurons. Here, we present a mechanism for RNA transport in which RNA granules “hitchhike” on moving lysosomes. In vitro biophysical modeling, live-cell microscopy, and unbiased proximity labeling proteomics reveal that annexin A11 (ANXA11), an RNA granule-associated phosphoinositide-binding protein, acts as a molecular tether between RNA granules and lysosomes. ANXA11 possesses an N-terminal low complexity domain, facilitating its phase separation into membraneless RNA granules, and a C-terminal membrane binding domain, enabling interactions with lysosomes. RNA granule transport requires ANXA11, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated mutations in ANXA11 impair RNA granule transport by disrupting their interactions with lysosomes. Thus, ANXA11 mediates neuronal RNA transport by tethering RNA granules to actively-transported lysosomes, performing a critical cellular function that is disrupted in ALS.

Abstract: Summary
Recent breakthroughs with synthetic budding yeast chromosomes expedite the creation of synthetic mammalian chromosomes and genomes. Mammals, unlike budding yeast, depend on the histone H3 variant, CENP-A, to epigenetically specify the location of the centromere—the locus essential for chromosome segregation. Prior human artificial chromosomes (HACs) required large arrays of centromeric α-satellite repeats harboring binding sites for the DNA sequence-specific binding protein, CENP-B. We report the development of a type of HAC that functions independently of these constraints. Formed by an initial CENP-A nucleosome seeding strategy, a construct lacking repetitive centromeric DNA formed several self-sufficient HACs that showed no uptake of genomic DNA. In contrast to traditional α-satellite HAC formation, the non-repetitive construct can form functional HACs without CENP-B or initial CENP-A nucleosome seeding, revealing distinct paths to centromere formation for different DNA sequence types. Our developments streamline the construction and characterization of HACs to facilitate mammalian synthetic genome efforts.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic conditions affect the developmental tempo of animals. Developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs) must therefore synchronize their dynamics with a variable timescale. We find that layered repression of genes couples GRN output with variable metabolism. When repressors of transcription or mRNA and protein stability are lost, fewer errors in Drosophila development occur when metabolism is lowered. We demonstrate the universality of this phenomenon by eliminating the entire microRNA family of repressors and find that development to maturity can be largely rescued when metabolism is reduced. Using a mathematical model that replicates GRN dynamics, we find that lowering metabolism suppresses the emergence of developmental errors by curtailing the influence of auxiliary repressors on GRN output. We experimentally show that gene expression dynamics are less affected by loss of repressors when metabolism is reduced. Thus, layered repression provides robustness through error suppression and may provide an evolutionary route to a shorter reproductive cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic and other cytoplasmic DNAs activate the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to induce inflammation via transcriptional activation by IRF3 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), but the functional consequences of exposing cGAS to chromosomes upon mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown are unknown. Here, we show that nucleosomes competitively inhibit DNA-dependent cGAS activation and that the cGAS-STING pathway is not effectively activated during normal mitosis. However, during mitotic arrest, low level cGAS-dependent IRF3 phosphorylation slowly accumulates without triggering inflammation. Phosphorylated IRF3, independently of its DNA-binding domain, stimulates apoptosis through alleviating Bcl-xL-dependent suppression of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. We propose that slow accumulation of phosphorylated IRF3, normally not sufficient for inducing inflammation, can trigger transcription-independent induction of apoptosis upon mitotic aberrations. Accordingly, expression of cGAS and IRF3 in cancer cells makes mouse xenograft tumors responsive to the anti-mitotic agent Taxol. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets for non-small cell lung cancer patients also suggest an effect of cGAS expression on taxane response.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) residing in the bone marrow (BM) accumulate during aging but are functionally impaired. However, the role of HSC-intrinsic and -extrinsic aging mechanisms remains debated. Megakaryocytes promote quiescence of neighboring HSCs. Nonetheless, whether megakaryocyte-HSC interactions change during pathological/natural aging is unclear. Premature aging in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome recapitulates physiological aging features, but whether these arise from altered stem or niche cells is unknown. Here, we show that the BM microenvironment promotes myelopoiesis in premature/physiological aging. During physiological aging, HSC-supporting niches decrease near bone but expand further from bone. Increased BM noradrenergic innervation promotes β2-adrenergic-receptor(AR)-interleukin-6-dependent megakaryopoiesis. Reduced β3-AR-Nos1 activity correlates with decreased endosteal niches and megakaryocyte apposition to sinusoids. However, chronic treatment of progeroid mice with β3-AR agonist decreases premature myeloid and HSC expansion and restores the proximal association of HSCs to megakaryocytes. Therefore, normal/premature aging of BM niches promotes myeloid expansion and can be improved by targeting the microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
The ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) contains ∼4,000 neurons that project to multiple targets and control innate social behaviors including aggression and mounting. However, the number of cell types in VMHvl and their relationship to connectivity and behavioral function are unknown. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing using two independent platforms—SMART-seq (∼4,500 neurons) and 10x (∼78,000 neurons)—and investigated correspondence between transcriptomic identity and axonal projections or behavioral activation, respectively. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) identified 17 transcriptomic types (T-types), including several sexually dimorphic clusters, the majority of which were validated by seqFISH. Immediate early gene analysis identified T-types exhibiting preferential responses to intruder males versus females but only rare examples of behavior-specific activation. Unexpectedly, many VMHvl T-types comprise a mixed population of neurons with different projection target preferences. Overall our analysis revealed that, surprisingly, few VMHvl T-types exhibit a clear correspondence with behavior-specific activation and connectivity.

Abstract: Summary
Rotavirus (RV) encounters intestinal epithelial cells amidst diverse microbiota, opening possibilities of microbes influencing RV infection. Although RV clearance typically requires adaptive immunity, we unintentionally generated RV-resistant immunodeficient mice, which, we hypothesized, reflected select microbes protecting against RV. Accordingly, such RV resistance was transferred by co-housing and fecal transplant. RV-protecting microbiota were interrogated by heat, filtration, and antimicrobial agents, followed by limiting dilution transplant to germ-free mice and microbiome analysis. This approach revealed that segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) were sufficient to protect mice against RV infection and associated diarrhea. Such protection was independent of previously defined RV-impeding factors, including interferon, IL-17, and IL-22. Colonization of the ileum by SFB induced changes in host gene expression and accelerated epithelial cell turnover. Incubation of RV with SFB-containing feces reduced infectivity in vitro, suggesting direct neutralization of RV. Thus, independent of immune cells, SFB confer protection against certain enteric viral infections and associated diarrheal disease.

Abstract: Summary
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) tightly regulates the entry of solutes from blood into the brain and is disrupted in several neurological diseases. Using Organ-Chip technology, we created an entirely human BBB-Chip with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain microvascular endothelial-like cells (iBMECs), astrocytes, and neurons. The iBMECs formed a tight monolayer that expressed markers specific to brain vasculature. The BBB-Chip exhibited physiologically relevant transendothelial electrical resistance and accurately predicted blood-to-brain permeability of pharmacologics. Upon perfusing the vascular lumen with whole blood, the microengineered capillary wall protected neural cells from plasma-induced toxicity. Patient-derived iPSCs from individuals with neurological diseases predicted disease-specific lack of transporters and disruption of barrier integrity. By combining Organ-Chip technology and human iPSC-derived tissue, we have created a neurovascular unit that recapitulates complex BBB functions, provides a platform for modeling inheritable neurological disorders, and advances drug screening, as well as personalized medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Nutritional status potentially influences immune responses; however, how nutritional signals regulate cellular dynamics and functionality remains obscure. Herein, we report that temporary fasting drastically reduces the number of lymphocytes by ∼50% in Peyer’s patches (PPs), the inductive site of the gut immune response. Subsequent refeeding seemingly restored the number of lymphocytes, but whose cellular composition was conspicuously altered. A large portion of germinal center and IgA+ B cells were lost via apoptosis during fasting. Meanwhile, naive B cells migrated from PPs to the bone marrow during fasting and then back to PPs during refeeding when stromal cells sensed nutritional signals and upregulated CXCL13 expression to recruit naive B cells. Furthermore, temporal fasting before oral immunization with ovalbumin abolished the induction of antigen-specific IgA, failed to induce oral tolerance, and eventually exacerbated food antigen-induced diarrhea. Thus, nutritional signals are critical in maintaining gut immune homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-linked leukodystrophy caused by mutations in Proteolipid Protein 1 (PLP1), encoding a major myelin protein, resulting in profound developmental delay and early lethality. Previous work showed involvement of unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways, but poor PLP1 genotype-phenotype associations suggest additional pathogenetic mechanisms. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and gene-correction, we show that patient-derived oligodendrocytes can develop to the pre-myelinating stage, but subsequently undergo cell death. Mutant oligodendrocytes demonstrated key hallmarks of ferroptosis including lipid peroxidation, abnormal iron metabolism, and hypersensitivity to free iron. Iron chelation rescued mutant oligodendrocyte apoptosis, survival, and differentiation in vitro, and post-transplantation in vivo. Finally, systemic treatment of Plp1 mutant Jimpy mice with deferiprone, a small molecule iron chelator, reduced oligodendrocyte apoptosis and enabled myelin formation. Thus, oligodendrocyte iron-induced cell death and myelination is rescued by iron chelation in PMD pre-clinical models.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to inherit learned information from parents could be evolutionarily beneficial, enabling progeny to better survive dangerous conditions. We discovered that, after C. elegans have learned to avoid the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14), they pass this learned behavior on to their progeny, through either the male or female germline, persisting through the fourth generation. Expression of the TGF-β ligand DAF-7 in the ASI sensory neurons correlates with and is required for this transgenerational avoidance behavior. Additionally, the Piwi Argonaute homolog PRG-1 and its downstream molecular components are required for transgenerational inheritance of both avoidance behavior and ASI daf-7 expression. Animals whose parents have learned to avoid PA14 display a PA14 avoidance-based survival advantage that is also prg-1 dependent, suggesting an adaptive response. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of pathogenic learning may optimize progeny decisions to increase survival in fluctuating environmental conditions.

Abstract: Summary
A hallmark feature of inflammation is the orchestrated recruitment of neutrophils from the bloodstream into inflamed tissue. Although selectins and integrins mediate recruitment in many tissues, they have a minimal role in the lungs and liver. Exploiting an unbiased in vivo functional screen, we identified a lung and liver homing peptide that functionally abrogates neutrophil recruitment to these organs. Using biochemical, genetic, and confocal intravital imaging approaches, we identified dipeptidase-1 (DPEP1) as the target and established its role as a physical adhesion receptor for neutrophil sequestration independent of its enzymatic activity. Importantly, genetic ablation or functional peptide blocking of DPEP1 significantly reduced neutrophil recruitment to the lungs and liver and provided improved survival in models of endotoxemia. Our data establish DPEP1 as a major adhesion receptor on the lung and liver endothelium and identify a therapeutic target for neutrophil-driven inflammatory diseases of the lungs.

Abstract: Summary
The gastrointestinal tract is enveloped by concentric and orthogonally aligned layers of smooth muscle; however, an understanding of the mechanisms by which these muscles become patterned and aligned in the embryo has been lacking. We find that Hedgehog acts through Bmp to delineate the position of the circumferentially oriented inner muscle layer, whereas localized Bmp inhibition is critical for allowing formation of the later-forming, longitudinally oriented outer layer. Because the layers form at different developmental stages, the muscle cells are exposed to unique mechanical stimuli that direct their alignments. Differential growth within the early gut tube generates residual strains that orient the first layer circumferentially, and when formed, the spontaneous contractions of this layer align the second layer longitudinally. Our data link morphogen-based patterning to mechanically controlled smooth muscle cell alignment and provide a mechanistic context for potentially understanding smooth muscle organization in a wide variety of tubular organs.

Abstract: Summary
For tumors to progress efficiently, cancer cells must overcome barriers of oxidative stress. Although dietary antioxidant supplementation or activation of endogenous antioxidants by NRF2 reduces oxidative stress and promotes early lung tumor progression, little is known about its effect on lung cancer metastasis. Here, we show that long-term supplementation with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and vitamin E promotes KRAS-driven lung cancer metastasis. The antioxidants stimulate metastasis by reducing levels of free heme and stabilizing the transcription factor BACH1. BACH1 activates transcription of Hexokinase 2 and Gapdh and increases glucose uptake, glycolysis rates, and lactate secretion, thereby stimulating glycolysis-dependent metastasis of mouse and human lung cancer cells. Targeting BACH1 normalized glycolysis and prevented antioxidant-induced metastasis, while increasing endogenous BACH1 expression stimulated glycolysis and promoted metastasis, also in the absence of antioxidants. We conclude that BACH1 stimulates glycolysis-dependent lung cancer metastasis and that BACH1 is activated under conditions of reduced oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
The developmental disorder Floating-Harbor syndrome (FHS) is caused by heterozygous truncating mutations in SRCAP, a gene encoding a chromatin remodeler mediating incorporation of histone variant H2A.Z. Here, we demonstrate that FHS-associated mutations result in loss of SRCAP nuclear localization, alter neural crest gene programs in human in vitro models and Xenopus embryos, and cause craniofacial defects. These defects are mediated by one of two H2A.Z subtypes, H2A.Z.2, whose knockdown mimics and whose overexpression rescues the FHS phenotype. Selective rescue by H2A.Z.2 is conferred by one of the three amino acid differences between the H2A.Z subtypes, S38/T38. We further show that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 genomic occupancy patterns are qualitatively similar, but quantitatively distinct, and H2A.Z.2 incorporation at AT-rich enhancers and expression of their associated genes are both sensitized to SRCAP truncations. Altogether, our results illuminate the mechanism underlying a human syndrome and uncover selective functions of H2A.Z subtypes during development.

Abstract: Summary
We report an ancient genome from the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC). The individual we sequenced fits as a mixture of people related to ancient Iranians (the largest component) and Southeast Asian hunter-gatherers, a unique profile that matches ancient DNA from 11 genetic outliers from sites in Iran and Turkmenistan in cultural communication with the IVC. These individuals had little if any Steppe pastoralist-derived ancestry, showing that it was not ubiquitous in northwest South Asia during the IVC as it is today. The Iranian-related ancestry in the IVC derives from a lineage leading to early Iranian farmers, herders, and hunter-gatherers before their ancestors separated, contradicting the hypothesis that the shared ancestry between early Iranians and South Asians reflects a large-scale spread of western Iranian farmers east. Instead, sampled ancient genomes from the Iranian plateau and IVC descend from different groups of hunter-gatherers who began farming without being connected by substantial movement of people.

Abstract: Summary
Phages express anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to inhibit CRISPR-Cas systems that would otherwise destroy their genomes. Most acr genes are located adjacent to anti-CRISPR-associated (aca) genes, which encode proteins with a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. The conservation of aca genes has served as a signpost for the identification of acr genes, but the function of the proteins encoded by these genes has not been investigated. Here we reveal that an acr-associated promoter drives high levels of acr transcription immediately after phage DNA injection and that Aca proteins subsequently repress this transcription. Without Aca activity, this strong transcription is lethal to a phage. Our results demonstrate how sufficient levels of Acr proteins accumulate early in the infection process to inhibit existing CRISPR-Cas complexes in the host cell. They also imply that the conserved role of Aca proteins is to mitigate the deleterious effects of strong constitutive transcription from acr promoters.

Abstract: Summary
Analyzing the spatial organization of molecules in cells and tissues is a cornerstone of biological research and clinical practice. However, despite enormous progress in molecular profiling of cellular constituents, spatially mapping them remains a disjointed and specialized machinery-intensive process, relying on either light microscopy or direct physical registration. Here, we demonstrate DNA microscopy, a distinct imaging modality for scalable, optics-free mapping of relative biomolecule positions. In DNA microscopy of transcripts, transcript molecules are tagged in situ with randomized nucleotides, labeling each molecule uniquely. A second in situ reaction then amplifies the tagged molecules, concatenates the resulting copies, and adds new randomized nucleotides to uniquely label each concatenation event. An algorithm decodes molecular proximities from these concatenated sequences and infers physical images of the original transcripts at cellular resolution with precise sequence information. Because its imaging power derives entirely from diffusive molecular dynamics, DNA microscopy constitutes a chemically encoded microscopy system.

Abstract: Summary
To uncover the selective forces shaping life-history trait evolution across species, we investigate the genomic basis underlying adaptations to seasonal habitat desiccation in African killifishes, identifying the genetic variants associated with positive and relaxed purifying selection in 45 killifish species and 231 wild individuals distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa. In annual species, genetic drift led to the expansion of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and caused the accumulation of deleterious genetic variants in key life-history modulating genes such as mtor, insr, ampk, foxo3, and polg. Relaxation of purifying selection is also significantly associated with mitochondrial function and aging in human populations. We find that relaxation of purifying selection prominently shapes genomes and is a prime candidate force molding the evolution of lifespan and the distribution of genetic variants associated with late-onset diseases in different species.

Abstract: Summary
The synthesis of new ribosomes begins during transcription of the rRNA and is widely assumed to follow an orderly 5′ to 3′ gradient. To visualize co-transcriptional assembly of ribosomal protein-RNA complexes in real time, we developed a single-molecule platform that simultaneously monitors transcription and protein association with the elongating transcript. Unexpectedly, the early assembly protein uS4 binds newly made pre-16S rRNA only transiently, likely due to non-native folding of the rRNA during transcription. Stable uS4 binding became more probable only in the presence of additional ribosomal proteins that bind upstream and downstream of protein uS4 by allowing productive assembly intermediates to form earlier. We propose that dynamic sampling of elongating RNA by multiple proteins overcomes heterogeneous RNA folding, preventing assembly bottlenecks and initiating assembly within the transcription time window. This may be a common feature of transcription-coupled RNP assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Social interactions occur between multiple individuals, but what is the detailed relationship between the neural dynamics across their brains? To address this question across timescales and levels of neural activity, we used wireless electrophysiology to simultaneously record from pairs of bats engaged in a wide range of natural social interactions. We found that neural activity was remarkably correlated between their brains over timescales from seconds to hours. The correlation depended on a shared social environment and was most prominent in high frequency local field potentials (>30 Hz), followed by local spiking activity. Furthermore, the degree of neural correlation covaried with the extent of social interactions, and an increase in correlation preceded their initiation. These results show that inter-brain correlation is an inherent feature of natural social interactions, reveal the domain of neural activity where it is most prominent, and provide a foundation for studying its functional role in social behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Caloric restriction is known to improve inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanisms by which reduced caloric intake modulates inflammation are poorly understood. Here we show that short-term fasting reduced monocyte metabolic and inflammatory activity and drastically reduced the number of circulating monocytes. Regulation of peripheral monocyte numbers was dependent on dietary glucose and protein levels. Specifically, we found that activation of the low-energy sensor 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hepatocytes and suppression of systemic CCL2 production by peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor alpha (PPARα) reduced monocyte mobilization from the bone marrow. Importantly, we show that fasting improves chronic inflammatory diseases without compromising monocyte emergency mobilization during acute infectious inflammation and tissue repair. These results reveal that caloric intake and liver energy sensors dictate the blood and tissue immune tone and link dietary habits to inflammatory disease outcome.

Abstract: Summary
Small proteins are traditionally overlooked due to computational and experimental difficulties in detecting them. To systematically identify small proteins, we carried out a comparative genomics study on 1,773 human-associated metagenomes from four different body sites. We describe >4,000 conserved protein families, the majority of which are novel; ∼30% of these protein families are predicted to be secreted or transmembrane. Over 90% of the small protein families have no known domain and almost half are not represented in reference genomes. We identify putative housekeeping, mammalian-specific, defense-related, and protein families that are likely to be horizontally transferred. We provide evidence of transcription and translation for a subset of these families. Our study suggests that small proteins are highly abundant and those of the human microbiome, in particular, may perform diverse functions that have not been previously reported.

Abstract: Summary
Asymmetric division in female meiosis creates selective pressure favoring selfish centromeres that bias their transmission to the egg. This centromere drive can explain the paradoxical rapid evolution of both centromere DNA and centromere-binding proteins despite conserved centromere function. Here, we define a molecular pathway linking expanded centromeres to histone phosphorylation and recruitment of microtubule destabilizing factors, leading to detachment of selfish centromeres from spindle microtubules that would direct them to the polar body. Exploiting centromere divergence between species, we show that selfish centromeres in two hybrid mouse models use the same molecular pathway but modulate it differently to enrich destabilizing factors. Our results indicate that increasing microtubule destabilizing activity is a general strategy for drive in both models, but centromeres have evolved distinct mechanisms to increase that activity. Furthermore, we show that drive depends on slowing meiotic progression, suggesting that selfish centromeres can be suppressed by regulating meiotic timing.

Abstract: Summary
The age-related failure to produce oligodendrocytes from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) is associated with irreversible neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS). Consequently, regenerative approaches have significant potential for treating chronic demyelinating diseases. Here, we show that the differentiation potential of adult rodent OPCs decreases with age. Aged OPCs become unresponsive to pro-differentiation signals, suggesting intrinsic constraints on therapeutic approaches aimed at enhancing OPC differentiation. This decline in functional capacity is associated with hallmarks of cellular aging, including decreased metabolic function and increased DNA damage. Fasting or treatment with metformin can reverse these changes and restore the regenerative capacity of aged OPCs, improving remyelination in aged animals following focal demyelination. Aged OPCs treated with metformin regain responsiveness to pro-differentiation signals, suggesting synergistic effects of rejuvenation and pro-differentiation therapies. These findings provide insight into aging-associated remyelination failure and suggest therapeutic interventions for reversing such declines in chronic disease.

Abstract: Summary
During cell division, newly replicated DNA is actively segregated to the daughter cells. In most bacteria, this process involves the DNA-binding protein ParB, which condenses the centromeric regions of sister DNA molecules into kinetochore-like structures that recruit the DNA partition ATPase ParA and the prokaroytic SMC/condensin complex. Here, we report the crystal structure of a ParB-like protein (PadC) that emerges to tightly bind the ribonucleotide CTP. The CTP-binding pocket of PadC is conserved in ParB and composed of signature motifs known to be essential for ParB function. We find that ParB indeed interacts with CTP and requires nucleotide binding for DNA condensation in vivo. We further show that CTP-binding modulates the affinity of ParB for centromeric parS sites, whereas parS recognition stimulates its CTPase activity. ParB proteins thus emerge as a new class of CTP-dependent molecular switches that act in concert with ATPases and GTPases to control fundamental cellular functions.

Abstract: Summary
Segregation of maternal determinants within the oocyte constitutes the first step in embryo patterning. In zebrafish oocytes, extensive ooplasmic streaming leads to the segregation of ooplasm from yolk granules along the animal-vegetal axis of the oocyte. Here, we show that this process does not rely on cortical actin reorganization, as previously thought, but instead on a cell-cycle-dependent bulk actin polymerization wave traveling from the animal to the vegetal pole of the oocyte. This wave functions in segregation by both pulling ooplasm animally and pushing yolk granules vegetally. Using biophysical experimentation and theory, we show that ooplasm pulling is mediated by bulk actin network flows exerting friction forces on the ooplasm, while yolk granule pushing is achieved by a mechanism closely resembling actin comet formation on yolk granules. Our study defines a novel role of cell-cycle-controlled bulk actin polymerization waves in oocyte polarization via ooplasmic segregation.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria and archaea possess a striking diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems divided into six types, posing a significant barrier to viral infection. As part of the virus-host arms race, viruses encode protein inhibitors of type I, II, and V CRISPR-Cas systems, but whether there are natural inhibitors of the other, mechanistically distinct CRISPR-Cas types is unknown. Here, we present the discovery of a type III CRISPR-Cas inhibitor, AcrIIIB1, encoded by the Sulfolobus virus SIRV2. AcrIIIB1 exclusively inhibits CRISPR-Cas subtype III-B immunity mediated by the RNase activity of the accessory protein Csx1. AcrIIIB1 does not appear to bind Csx1 but, rather, interacts with two distinct subtype III-B effector complexes—Cmr-α and Cmr-γ—which, in response to protospacer transcript binding, are known to synthesize cyclic oligoadenylates (cOAs) that activate the Csx1 “collateral” RNase. Taken together, we infer that AcrIIIB1 inhibits type III-B CRISPR-Cas immunity by interfering with a Csx1 RNase-related process.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate prediction of long-term outcomes remains a challenge in the care of cancer patients. Due to the difficulty of serial tumor sampling, previous prediction tools have focused on pretreatment factors. However, emerging non-invasive diagnostics have increased opportunities for serial tumor assessments. We describe the Continuous Individualized Risk Index (CIRI), a method to dynamically determine outcome probabilities for individual patients utilizing risk predictors acquired over time. Similar to “win probability” models in other fields, CIRI provides a real-time probability by integrating risk assessments throughout a patient’s course. Applying CIRI to patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, we demonstrate improved outcome prediction compared to conventional risk models. We demonstrate CIRI’s broader utility in analogous models of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and breast adenocarcinoma and perform a proof-of-concept analysis demonstrating how CIRI could be used to develop predictive biomarkers for therapy selection. We envision that dynamic risk assessment will facilitate personalized medicine and enable innovative therapeutic paradigms.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism that results in parent-of-origin monoallelic expression of specific genes, which precludes uniparental development and underlies various diseases. Here, we explored molecular and developmental aspects of imprinting in humans by generating exclusively paternal human androgenetic embryonic stem cells (aESCs) and comparing them with exclusively maternal parthenogenetic ESCs (pESCs) and bi-parental ESCs, establishing a pluripotent cell system of distinct parental backgrounds. Analyzing the transcriptomes and methylomes of human aESCs, pESCs, and bi-parental ESCs enabled the characterization of regulatory relations at known imprinted regions and uncovered imprinted gene candidates within and outside known imprinted regions. Investigating the consequences of uniparental differentiation, we showed the known paternal-genome preference for placental contribution, revealed a similar bias toward liver differentiation, and implicated the involvement of the imprinted gene IGF2 in this process. Our results demonstrate the utility of parent-specific human ESCs for dissecting the role of imprinting in human development and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Current approaches to reducing the latent HIV reservoir entail first reactivating virus-containing cells to become visible to the immune system. A critical second step is killing these cells to reduce reservoir size. Endogenous cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) may not be adequate because of cellular exhaustion and the evolution of CTL-resistant viruses. We have designed a universal CAR-T cell platform based on CTLs engineered to bind a variety of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies. We show that this platform, convertibleCAR-T cells, effectively kills HIV-infected, but not uninfected, CD4 T cells from blood, tonsil, or spleen and only when armed with anti-HIV antibodies. convertibleCAR-T cells also kill within 48 h more than half of the inducible reservoir found in blood of HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy. The modularity of convertibleCAR-T cell system, which allows multiplexing with several anti-HIV antibodies yielding greater breadth and control, makes it a promising tool for attacking the latent HIV reservoir.

Abstract: Summary
Approximately 30% of human lung cancers acquire mutations in either Keap1 or Nfe2l2, resulting in the stabilization of Nrf2, the Nfe2l2 gene product, which controls oxidative homeostasis. Here, we show that heme triggers the degradation of Bach1, a pro-metastatic transcription factor, by promoting its interaction with the ubiquitin ligase Fbxo22. Nrf2 accumulation in lung cancers causes the stabilization of Bach1 by inducing Ho1, the enzyme catabolizing heme. In mouse models of lung cancers, loss of Keap1 or Fbxo22 induces metastasis in a Bach1-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of Ho1 suppresses metastasis in a Fbxo22-dependent manner. Human metastatic lung cancer display high levels of Ho1 and Bach1. Bach1 transcriptional signature is associated with poor survival and metastasis in lung cancer patients. We propose that Nrf2 activates a metastatic program by inhibiting the heme- and Fbxo22-mediated degradation of Bach1, and that Ho1 inhibitors represent an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent lung cancer metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
In search of the molecular identities of cold-sensing receptors, we carried out an unbiased genetic screen for cold-sensing mutants in C. elegans and isolated a mutant allele of glr-3 gene that encodes a kainate-type glutamate receptor. While glutamate receptors are best known to transmit chemical synaptic signals in the CNS, we show that GLR-3 senses cold in the peripheral sensory neuron ASER to trigger cold-avoidance behavior. GLR-3 transmits cold signals via G protein signaling independently of its glutamate-gated channel function, suggesting GLR-3 as a metabotropic cold receptor. The vertebrate GLR-3 homolog GluK2 from zebrafish, mouse, and human can all function as a cold receptor in heterologous systems. Mouse DRG sensory neurons express GluK2, and GluK2 knockdown in these neurons suppresses their sensitivity to cold but not cool temperatures. Our study identifies an evolutionarily conserved cold receptor, revealing that a central chemical receptor unexpectedly functions as a thermal receptor in the periphery.

Abstract: Summary
Most tissue-resident macrophage (RTM) populations are seeded by waves of embryonic hematopoiesis and are self-maintained independently of a bone marrow contribution during adulthood. A proportion of RTMs, however, is constantly replaced by blood monocytes, and their functions compared to embryonic RTMs remain unclear. The kinetics and extent of the contribution of circulating monocytes to RTM replacement during homeostasis, inflammation, and disease are highly debated. Here, we identified Ms4a3 as a specific gene expressed by granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and subsequently generated Ms4a3TdT reporter, Ms4a3Cre, and Ms4a3CreERT2 fate-mapping models. These models traced efficiently monocytes and granulocytes, but no lymphocytes or tissue dendritic cells. Using these models, we precisely quantified the contribution of monocytes to the RTM pool during homeostasis and inflammation. The unambiguous identification of monocyte-derived cells will permit future studies of their function under any condition.

Abstract: Summary
Delineating ecologically meaningful populations among microbes is important for identifying their roles in environmental and host-associated microbiomes. Here, we introduce a metric of recent gene flow, which when applied to co-existing microbes, identifies congruent genetic and ecological units separated by strong gene flow discontinuities from their next of kin. We then develop a pipeline to identify genome regions within these units that show differential adaptation and allow mapping of populations onto environmental variables or host associations. Using this reverse ecology approach, we show that the human commensal bacterium Ruminococcus gnavus breaks up into sharply delineated populations that show different associations with health and disease. Defining populations by recent gene flow in this way will facilitate the analysis of bacterial and archaeal genomes using ecological and evolutionary theory developed for plants and animals, thus allowing for testing unifying principles across all biology.

Abstract: Summary
While Mediator plays a key role in eukaryotic transcription, little is known about its mechanism of action. This study combines CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens, degron assays, Hi-C, and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to dissect the function and structure of mammalian Mediator (mMED). Deletion analyses in B, T, and embryonic stem cells (ESC) identified a core of essential subunits required for Pol II recruitment genome-wide. Conversely, loss of non-essential subunits mostly affects promoters linked to multiple enhancers. Contrary to current models, however, mMED and Pol II are dispensable to physically tether regulatory DNA, a topological activity requiring architectural proteins. Cryo-EM analysis revealed a conserved core, with non-essential subunits increasing structural complexity of the tail module, a primary transcription factor target. Changes in tail structure markedly increase Pol II and kinase module interactions. We propose that Mediator’s structural pliability enables it to integrate and transmit regulatory signals and act as a functional, rather than an architectural bridge, between promoters and enhancers.

Abstract: Summary
Patterning in plants relies on oriented cell divisions and acquisition of specific cell identities. Plants regularly endure wounds caused by abiotic or biotic environmental stimuli and have developed extraordinary abilities to restore their tissues after injuries. Here, we provide insight into a mechanism of restorative patterning that repairs tissues after wounding. Laser-assisted elimination of different cells in Arabidopsis root combined with live-imaging tracking during vertical growth allowed analysis of the regeneration processes in vivo. Specifically, the cells adjacent to the inner side of the injury re-activated their stem cell transcriptional programs. They accelerated their progression through cell cycle, coordinately changed the cell division orientation, and ultimately acquired de novo the correct cell fates to replace missing cells. These observations highlight existence of unknown intercellular positional signaling and demonstrate the capability of specified cells to re-acquire stem cell programs as a crucial part of the plant-specific mechanism of wound healing.

Abstract: Summary
CD8 T cells play essential roles in anti-tumor immune responses. Here, we performed genome-scale CRISPR screens in CD8 T cells directly under cancer immunotherapy settings and identified regulators of tumor infiltration and degranulation. The in vivo screen robustly re-identified canonical immunotherapy targets such as PD-1 and Tim-3, along with genes that have not been characterized in T cells. The infiltration and degranulation screens converged on an RNA helicase Dhx37. Dhx37 knockout enhanced the efficacy of antigen-specific CD8 T cells against triple-negative breast cancer in vivo. Immunological characterization in mouse and human CD8 T cells revealed that DHX37 suppresses effector functions, cytokine production, and T cell activation. Transcriptomic profiling and biochemical interrogation revealed a role for DHX37 in modulating NF-κB. These data demonstrate high-throughput in vivo genetic screens for immunotherapy target discovery and establishes DHX37 as a functional regulator of CD8 T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Denisovans are an extinct group of humans whose morphology remains unknown. Here, we present a method for reconstructing skeletal morphology using DNA methylation patterns. Our method is based on linking unidirectional methylation changes to loss-of-function phenotypes. We tested performance by reconstructing Neanderthal and chimpanzee skeletal morphologies and obtained >85% precision in identifying divergent traits. We then applied this method to the Denisovan and offer a putative morphological profile. We suggest that Denisovans likely shared with Neanderthals traits such as an elongated face and a wide pelvis. We also identify Denisovan-derived changes, such as an increased dental arch and lateral cranial expansion. Our predictions match the only morphologically informative Denisovan bone to date, as well as the Xuchang skull, which was suggested by some to be a Denisovan. We conclude that DNA methylation can be used to reconstruct anatomical features, including some that do not survive in the fossil record.

Abstract: Summary
Social interactions involve complex decision-making tasks that are shaped by dynamic, mutual feedback between participants. An open question is whether and how emergent properties may arise across brains of socially interacting individuals to influence social decisions. By simultaneously performing microendoscopic calcium imaging in pairs of socially interacting mice, we find that animals exhibit interbrain correlations of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex that are dependent on ongoing social interaction. Activity synchrony arises from two neuronal populations that separately encode one’s own behaviors and those of the social partner. Strikingly, interbrain correlations predict future social interactions as well as dominance relationships in a competitive context. Together, our study provides conclusive evidence for interbrain synchrony in rodents, uncovers how synchronization arises from activity at the single-cell level, and presents a role for interbrain neural activity coupling as a property of multi-animal systems in coordinating and sustaining social interactions between individuals.

Abstract: Summary
Somatosensory over-reactivity is common among patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and is hypothesized to contribute to core ASD behaviors. However, effective treatments for sensory over-reactivity and ASDs are lacking. We found distinct somatosensory neuron pathophysiological mechanisms underlie tactile abnormalities in different ASD mouse models and contribute to some ASD-related behaviors. Developmental loss of ASD-associated genes Shank3 or Mecp2 in peripheral mechanosensory neurons leads to region-specific brain abnormalities, revealing links between developmental somatosensory over-reactivity and the genesis of aberrant behaviors. Moreover, acute treatment with a peripherally restricted GABAA receptor agonist that acts directly on mechanosensory neurons reduced tactile over-reactivity in six distinct ASD models. Chronic treatment of Mecp2 and Shank3 mutant mice improved body condition, some brain abnormalities, anxiety-like behaviors, and some social impairments but not memory impairments, motor deficits, or overgrooming. Our findings reveal a potential therapeutic strategy targeting peripheral mechanosensory neurons to treat tactile over-reactivity and select ASD-related behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
The process of cardiac morphogenesis in humans is incompletely understood. Its full characterization requires a deep exploration of the organ-wide orchestration of gene expression with a single-cell spatial resolution. Here, we present a molecular approach that reveals the comprehensive transcriptional landscape of cell types populating the embryonic heart at three developmental stages and that maps cell-type-specific gene expression to specific anatomical domains. Spatial transcriptomics identified unique gene profiles that correspond to distinct anatomical regions in each developmental stage. Human embryonic cardiac cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing confirmed and enriched the spatial annotation of embryonic cardiac gene expression. In situ sequencing was then used to refine these results and create a spatial subcellular map for the three developmental phases. Finally, we generated a publicly available web resource of the human developing heart to facilitate future studies on human cardiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Human monogenic diabetes, caused by mutations in genes involved in beta cell development and function, has been a challenge to study because multiple mouse models have not fully recapitulated the human disease. Here, we use genome edited human embryonic stem cells to understand the most common form of monogenic diabetes, MODY3, caused by mutations in the transcription factor HNF1A. We found that HNF1A is necessary to repress an alpha cell gene expression signature, maintain endocrine cell function, and regulate cellular metabolism. In addition, we identified the human-specific long non-coding RNA, LINKA, as an HNF1A target necessary for normal mitochondrial respiration. These findings provide a possible explanation for the species difference in disease phenotypes observed with HNF1A mutations and offer mechanistic insights into how the HNF1A gene may also influence type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Antisense Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) guide silencing of established transposons during germline development, and sense piRNAs drive ping-pong amplification of the antisense pool, but how the germline responds to genome invasion is not understood. The KoRV-A gammaretrovirus infects the soma and germline and is sweeping through wild koalas by a combination of horizontal and vertical transfer, allowing direct analysis of retroviral invasion of the germline genome. Gammaretroviruses produce spliced Env mRNAs and unspliced transcripts encoding Gag, Pol, and the viral genome, but KoRV-A piRNAs are almost exclusively derived from unspliced genomic transcripts and are strongly sense-strand biased. Significantly, selective piRNA processing of unspliced proviral transcripts is conserved from insects to placental mammals. We speculate that bypassed splicing generates a conserved molecular pattern that directs proviral genomic transcripts to the piRNA biogenesis machinery and that this “innate” piRNA response suppresses transposition until antisense piRNAs are produced, establishing sequence-specific adaptive immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Direct cellular reprogramming provides a powerful platform to study cell plasticity and dissect mechanisms underlying cell fate determination. Here, we report a single-cell transcriptomic study of human cardiac (hiCM) reprogramming that utilizes an analysis pipeline incorporating current data normalization methods, multiple trajectory prediction algorithms, and a cell fate index calculation we developed to measure reprogramming progression. These analyses revealed hiCM reprogramming-specific features and a decision point at which cells either embark on reprogramming or regress toward their original fibroblast state. In combination with functional screening, we found that immune-response-associated DNA methylation is required for hiCM induction and validated several downstream targets of reprogramming factors as necessary for productive hiCM reprograming. Collectively, this single-cell transcriptomics study provides detailed datasets that reveal molecular features underlying hiCM determination and rigorous analytical pipelines for predicting cell fate conversion.

Abstract: Summary
Ectopic expression of combinations of transcription factors (TFs) can drive direct lineage conversion, thereby reprogramming a somatic cell’s identity. To determine the molecular mechanisms by which Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT) induce conversion from a cardiac fibroblast toward an induced cardiomyocyte, we performed comprehensive transcriptomic, DNA-occupancy, and epigenomic interrogation throughout the reprogramming process. Integration of these datasets identified new TFs involved in cardiac reprogramming and revealed context-specific roles for GMT, including the ability of Mef2c and Tbx5 to independently promote chromatin remodeling at previously inaccessible sites. We also find evidence for cooperative facilitation and refinement of each TF’s binding profile in a combinatorial setting. A reporter assay employing newly defined regulatory elements confirmed that binding of a single TF can be sufficient for gene activation, suggesting that co-binding events do not necessarily reflect synergy. These results shed light on fundamental mechanisms by which combinations of TFs direct lineage conversion.

Abstract: Summary
Growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is an inflammation-associated hormone with poorly defined biology. Here, we investigated the role of GDF15 in bacterial and viral infections. We found that inflammation induced GDF15, and that GDF15 was necessary for surviving both bacterial and viral infections, as well as sepsis. The protective effects of GDF15 were largely independent of pathogen control or the magnitude of inflammatory response, suggesting a role in disease tolerance. Indeed, we found that GDF15 was required for hepatic sympathetic outflow and triglyceride metabolism. Failure to defend the lower limit of plasma triglyceride levels was associated with impaired cardiac function and maintenance of body temperature, effects that could be rescued by exogenous administration of lipids. Together, we show that GDF15 coordinates tolerance to inflammatory damage through regulation of triglyceride metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Liver fibrosis is a very common condition seen in millions of patients with various liver diseases, and yet no effective treatments are available owing to poorly characterized molecular pathogenesis. Here, we show that leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) is a functional ligand of Tie1, a poorly characterized endothelial cell (EC)-specific orphan receptor. Upon binding to Tie1, LECT2 interrupts Tie1/Tie2 heterodimerization, facilitates Tie2/Tie2 homodimerization, activates PPAR signaling, and inhibits the migration and tube formations of EC. In vivo studies showed that LECT2 overexpression inhibits portal angiogenesis, promotes sinusoid capillarization, and worsens fibrosis, whereas these changes were reversed in Lect2-KO mice. Adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9)-LECT2 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) treatment significantly attenuates fibrosis. Upregulation of LECT2 is associated with advanced human liver fibrosis staging. We concluded that targeting LECT2/Tie1 signaling may represent a potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis, and serum LECT2 level may be a potential biomarker for the screening and diagnosis of liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
The precise control of CRISPR-Cas9 activity is required for a number of genome engineering technologies. Here, we report a generalizable platform that provided the first synthetic small-molecule inhibitors of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) that weigh <500 Da and are cell permeable, reversible, and stable under physiological conditions. We developed a suite of high-throughput assays for SpCas9 functions, including a primary screening assay for SpCas9 binding to the protospacer adjacent motif, and used these assays to screen a structurally diverse collection of natural-product-like small molecules to ultimately identify compounds that disrupt the SpCas9-DNA interaction. Using these synthetic anti-CRISPR small molecules, we demonstrated dose and temporal control of SpCas9 and catalytically impaired SpCas9 technologies, including transcription activation, and identified a pharmacophore for SpCas9 inhibition using structure-activity relationships. These studies establish a platform for rapidly identifying synthetic, miniature, cell-permeable, and reversible inhibitors against both SpCas9 and next-generation CRISPR-associated nucleases.

Abstract: Summary
Cargo trafficking along microtubules is exploited by eukaryotic viruses, but no such examples have been reported in bacteria. Several large Pseudomonas phages assemble a dynamic, tubulin-based (PhuZ) spindle that centers replicating phage DNA sequestered within a nucleus-like structure. Here, we show that capsids assemble on the membrane and then move rapidly along PhuZ filaments toward the phage nucleus for DNA packaging. The spindle rotates the phage nucleus, distributing capsids around its surface. PhuZ filaments treadmill toward the nucleus at a constant rate similar to the rate of capsid movement and the linear velocity of nucleus rotation. Capsids become trapped along mutant static PhuZ filaments that are defective in GTP hydrolysis. Our results suggest a transport and distribution mechanism in which capsids attached to the sides of filaments are trafficked to the nucleus by PhuZ polymerization at the poles, demonstrating that the phage cytoskeleton evolved cargo-trafficking capabilities in bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
Poxviruses encode a multisubunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRNAP) that carries out viral gene expression in the host cytoplasm. We report cryo-EM structures of core and complete vRNAP enzymes from Vaccinia virus at 2.8 Å resolution. The vRNAP core enzyme resembles eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) but also reveals many virus-specific features, including the transcription factor Rap94. The complete enzyme additionally contains the transcription factor VETF, the mRNA processing factors VTF/CE and NPH-I, the viral core protein E11, and host tRNAGln. This complex can carry out the entire early transcription cycle. The structures show that Rap94 partially resembles the Pol II initiation factor TFIIB, that the vRNAP subunit Rpo30 resembles the Pol II elongation factor TFIIS, and that NPH-I resembles chromatin remodeling enzymes. Together with the accompanying paper (Hillen et al., 2019), these results provide the basis for unraveling the mechanisms of poxvirus transcription and RNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Cells have evolved complex mechanisms to maintain protein homeostasis, such as the UPRER, which are strongly associated with several diseases and the aging process. We performed a whole-genome CRISPR-based knockout (KO) screen to identify genes important for cells to survive ER-based protein misfolding stress. We identified the cell-surface hyaluronidase (HAase), Transmembrane Protein 2 (TMEM2), as a potent modulator of ER stress resistance. The breakdown of the glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan (HA), by TMEM2 within the extracellular matrix (ECM) altered ER stress resistance independent of canonical UPRER pathways but dependent upon the cell-surface receptor, CD44, a putative HA receptor, and the MAPK cell-signaling components, ERK and p38. Last, and most surprisingly, ectopic expression of human TMEM2 in C. elegans protected animals from ER stress and increased both longevity and pathogen resistance independent of canonical UPRER activation but dependent on the ERK ortholog mpk-1 and the p38 ortholog pmk-1.

Abstract: Summary
Voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels initiate action potentials in nerve, muscle, and other electrically excitable cells. The structural basis of voltage gating is uncertain because the resting state exists only at deeply negative membrane potentials. To stabilize the resting conformation, we inserted voltage-shifting mutations and introduced a disulfide crosslink in the VS of the ancestral bacterial sodium channel NaVAb. Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of the resting state and a complete voltage-dependent gating mechanism. The S4 segment of the VS is drawn intracellularly, with three gating charges passing through the transmembrane electric field. This movement forms an elbow connecting S4 to the S4-S5 linker, tightens the collar around the S6 activation gate, and prevents its opening. Our structure supports the classical “sliding helix” mechanism of voltage sensing and provides a complete gating mechanism for voltage sensor function, pore opening, and activation-gate closure based on high-resolution structures of a single sodium channel protein.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers frequently remain dependent on ER signaling even after acquiring resistance to endocrine agents, prompting the development of optimized ER antagonists. Fulvestrant is unique among approved ER therapeutics due to its capacity for full ER antagonism, thought to be achieved through ER degradation. The clinical potential of fulvestrant is limited by poor physicochemical features, spurring attempts to generate ER degraders with improved drug-like properties. We show that optimization of ER degradation does not guarantee full ER antagonism in breast cancer cells; ER “degraders” exhibit a spectrum of transcriptional activities and anti-proliferative potential. Mechanistically, we find that fulvestrant-like antagonists suppress ER transcriptional activity not by ER elimination, but by markedly slowing the intra-nuclear mobility of ER. Increased ER turnover occurs as a consequence of ER immobilization. These findings provide proof-of-concept that small molecule perturbation of transcription factor mobility may enable therapeutic targeting of this challenging target class.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation coordinates tissue regeneration via damaged cell removal and stem cell activation. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) survive inflammatory stress that kills other blood cells, but the mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly understood. Here, we find that tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) acts differently on HSCs and progenitors, thus facilitating hematopoietic clearance and promoting regeneration. We show that while inducing myeloid progenitor apoptosis, TNF-α promotes HSC survival and myeloid differentiation by activating a strong and specific p65-nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent gene program that primarily prevents necroptosis rather than apoptosis, induces immunomodulatory functions, and poises HSCs for myeloid cell production. These TNF-α-driven mechanisms are critical for HSC response to inflammatory stress but are also hijacked in aged and malignant HSCs. Our results reveal several TNF-α-mediated pro-survival mechanisms unique to HSCs, highlight an important role for necroptosis in HSC killing, and establish TNF-α as a major pro-survival and pro-regeneration factor for HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors are composed of phenotypically heterogeneous cancer cells that often resemble various differentiation states of their lineage of origin. Within this hierarchy, it is thought that an immature subpopulation of tumor-propagating cancer stem cells (CSCs) differentiates into non-tumorigenic progeny, providing a rationale for therapeutic strategies that specifically eradicate CSCs or induce their differentiation. The clinical success of these approaches depends on CSC differentiation being unidirectional rather than reversible, yet this question remains unresolved even in prototypically hierarchical malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we show in murine and human models of AML that, upon perturbation of endogenous expression of the lineage-determining transcription factor PU.1 or withdrawal of established differentiation therapies, some mature leukemia cells can de-differentiate and reacquire clonogenic and leukemogenic properties. Our results reveal plasticity of CSC maturation in AML, highlighting the need to therapeutically eradicate cancer cells across a range of differentiation states.

Abstract: Summary
T cell recognition of specific antigens mediates protection from pathogens and controls neoplasias, but can also cause autoimmunity. Our knowledge of T cell antigens and their implications for human health is limited by the technical limitations of T cell profiling technologies. Here, we present T-Scan, a high-throughput platform for identification of antigens productively recognized by T cells. T-Scan uses lentiviral delivery of antigen libraries into cells for endogenous processing and presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Target cells functionally recognized by T cells are isolated using a reporter for granzyme B activity, and the antigens mediating recognition are identified by next-generation sequencing. We show T-Scan correctly identifies cognate antigens of T cell receptors (TCRs) from viral and human genome-wide libraries. We apply T-Scan to discover new viral antigens, perform high-resolution mapping of TCR specificity, and characterize the reactivity of a tumor-derived TCR. T-Scan is a powerful approach for studying T cell responses.

Abstract: Summary
New opportunities are needed to increase immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) benefit. Whereas the interferon (IFN)γ pathway harbors both ICB resistance factors and therapeutic opportunities, this has not been systematically investigated for IFNγ-independent signaling routes. A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to sensitize IFNγ receptor-deficient tumor cells to CD8 T cell elimination uncovered several hits mapping to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway. Clinically, we show that TNF antitumor activity is only limited in tumors at baseline and in ICB non-responders, correlating with its low abundance. Taking advantage of the genetic screen, we demonstrate that ablation of the top hit, TRAF2, lowers the TNF cytotoxicity threshold in tumors by redirecting TNF signaling to favor RIPK1-dependent apoptosis. TRAF2 loss greatly enhanced the therapeutic potential of pharmacologic inhibition of its interaction partner cIAP, another screen hit, thereby cooperating with ICB. Our results suggest that selective reduction of the TNF cytotoxicity threshold increases the susceptibility of tumors to immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin are key players in three-dimensional chromatin organization. The topologically associating domains (TADs) demarcated by CTCF are remarkably well conserved between species, although genome-wide CTCF binding has diverged substantially following transposon-mediated motif expansions. Therefore, the CTCF consensus motif poorly predicts TADs, and additional factors must modulate CTCF binding and subsequent TAD formation. Here, we demonstrate that the ChAHP complex (CHD4, ADNP, HP1) competes with CTCF for a common set of binding motifs. In Adnp knockout cells, novel insulated regions are formed at sites normally bound by ChAHP, whereas proximal canonical boundaries are weakened. These data reveal that CTCF-mediated loop formation is modulated by a distinct zinc-finger protein complex. Strikingly, ChAHP-bound loci are mainly situated within less diverged SINE B2 transposable elements. This implicates ChAHP in maintenance of evolutionarily conserved spatial chromatin organization by buffering novel CTCF binding sites that emerged through SINE expansions.

Abstract: Summary
The NRF2 transcription factor controls a cell stress program that is implicated in cancer and there is great interest in targeting NRF2 for therapy. We show that NRF2 activity depends on Fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K)—a kinase that triggers protein de-glycation. In its absence, NRF2 is extensively glycated, unstable, and defective at binding to small MAF proteins and transcriptional activation. Moreover, the development of hepatocellular carcinoma triggered by MYC and Keap1 inactivation depends on FN3K in vivo. N-acetyl cysteine treatment partially rescues the effects of FN3K loss on NRF2 driven tumor phenotypes indicating a key role for NRF2-mediated redox balance. Mass spectrometry reveals that other proteins undergo FN3K-sensitive glycation, including translation factors, heat shock proteins, and histones. How glycation affects their functions remains to be defined. In summary, our study reveals a surprising role for the glycation of cellular proteins and implicates FN3K as targetable modulator of NRF2 activity in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Although sensitizing processes occur earlier, schizophrenia is diagnosed in young adulthood, which suggests that it might involve a pathological transition during late brain development in predisposed individuals. Parvalbumin (PV) interneuron alterations have been noticed, but their role in the disease is unclear. Here we demonstrate that adult LgDel+/− mice, a genetic model of schizophrenia, exhibit PV neuron hypo-recruitment and associated chronic PV neuron plasticity together with network and cognitive deficits. All these deficits can be permanently rescued by chemogenetic activation of PV neurons or D2R antagonist treatments, specifically in the ventral hippocampus (vH) or medial-prefrontal cortex during a late-adolescence-sensitive time window. PV neuron alterations were initially restricted to the hippocampal CA1/subiculum, where they became responsive to treatment in late adolescence. Therefore, progression to disease in schizophrenia-model mice can be prevented by treatments supporting vH-mPFC PV network function during a sensitive time window late in adolescence, suggesting therapeutic strategies to prevent the outbreak of schizophrenia.

Abstract: Summary
Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet most patients do not respond. Here, we investigated mechanisms of response by profiling the proteome of clinical samples from advanced stage melanoma patients undergoing either tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-based or anti- programmed death 1 (PD1) immunotherapy. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we quantified over 10,300 proteins in total and ∼4,500 proteins across most samples in each dataset. Statistical analyses revealed higher oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism in responders than in non-responders in both treatments. To elucidate the effects of the metabolic state on the immune response, we examined melanoma cells upon metabolic perturbations or CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts. These experiments indicated lipid metabolism as a regulatory mechanism that increases melanoma immunogenicity by elevating antigen presentation, thereby increasing sensitivity to T cell mediated killing both in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, our proteomic analyses revealed association between the melanoma metabolic state and the response to immunotherapy, which can be the basis for future improvement of therapeutic response.

Expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in ATXN1 causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a neurodegenerative disease that impairs coordination and cognition. While ATXN1 is associated with increased Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk, CAG repeat number in AD patients is not changed. Here, we investigated the consequences of ataxin-1 loss of function and discovered that knockout of Atxn1 reduced CIC-ETV4/5-mediated inhibition of Bace1 transcription, leading to increased BACE1 levels and enhanced amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, selectively in AD-vulnerable brain regions. Elevated BACE1 expression exacerbated Aβ deposition and gliosis in AD mouse models and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and olfactory axonal targeting. In SCA1 mice, polyglutamine-expanded mutant ataxin-1 led to the increase of BACE1 post-transcriptionally, both in cerebrum and cerebellum, and caused axonal-targeting deficit and neurodegeneration in the hippocampal CA2 region. These findings suggest that loss of ataxin-1 elevates BACE1 expression and Aβ pathology, rendering it a potential contributor to AD risk and pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), cause severe and debilitating rheumatic diseases worldwide, resulting in severe morbidity and economic costs. Recently, MXRA8 was reported as an entry receptor. Here, we present the crystal structures of the mouse MXRA8, human MXRA8 in complex with the CHIKV E protein, and the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human MXRA8 and CHIKV virus-like particle. MXRA8 has two Ig-like domains with unique structural topologies. This receptor binds in the “canyon” between two protomers of the E spike on the surface of the virion. The atomic details at the interface between the two binding entities reveal that both the two domains and the hinge region of MXRA8 are involved in interaction with CHIKV E1-E2 residues from two protomers. Notably, the stalk region of MXRA8 is critical for CHIKV virus entry. This finding provides important information regarding the development of therapeutic countermeasures against those arthritogenic alphaviruses.

Abstract: Summary
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) guide transposon silencing in animals. The 22–30 nt piRNAs are processed in the cytoplasm from long non-coding RNAs that often lack RNA processing hallmarks of export-competent transcripts. By studying how these transcripts achieve nuclear export, we uncover an RNA export pathway specific for piRNA precursors in the Drosophila germline. This pathway requires Nxf3-Nxt1, a variant of the hetero-dimeric mRNA export receptor Nxf1-Nxt1. Nxf3 interacts with UAP56, a nuclear RNA helicase essential for mRNA export, and CG13741/Bootlegger, which recruits Nxf3-Nxt1 and UAP56 to heterochromatic piRNA source loci. Upon RNA cargo binding, Nxf3 achieves nuclear export via the exportin Crm1 and accumulates together with Bootlegger in peri-nuclear nuage, suggesting that after export, Nxf3-Bootlegger delivers precursor transcripts to the piRNA processing sites. These findings indicate that the piRNA pathway bypasses nuclear RNA surveillance systems to export unprocessed transcripts to the cytoplasm, a strategy also exploited by retroviruses.

Abstract: Summary
Lassa virus (LASV) causes hemorrhagic fever and is endemic in West Africa. Protective antibody responses primarily target the LASV surface glycoprotein (GPC), and GPC-B competition group antibodies often show potent neutralizing activity in humans. However, which features confer potent and broadly neutralizing antibody responses is unclear. Here, we compared three crystal structures of LASV GPC complexed with GPC-B antibodies of varying neutralization potency. Each GPC-B antibody recognized an overlapping epitope involved in binding of two adjacent GPC monomers and preserved the prefusion trimeric conformation. Differences among GPC-antibody interactions highlighted specific residues that enhance neutralization. Using structure-guided amino acid substitutions, we increased the neutralization potency and breadth of these antibodies to include all major LASV lineages. The ability to define antibody residues that allow potent and broad neutralizing activity, together with findings from analyses of inferred germline precursors, is critical to develop potent therapeutics and for vaccine design and assessment.

Abstract: Summary
This study identifies mechanisms mediating responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors using mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. By creating new mammary tumor models, we find that tumor mutation burden and specific immune cells are associated with response. Further, we developed a rich resource of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk mRNA-seq data of immunotherapy-treated and non-treated tumors from sensitive and resistant murine models. Using this, we uncover that immune checkpoint therapy induces T follicular helper cell activation of B cells to facilitate the anti-tumor response in these models. We also show that B cell activation of T cells and the generation of antibody are key to immunotherapy response and propose a new biomarker for immune checkpoint therapy. In total, this work presents resources of new preclinical models of breast cancer with large mRNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq datasets annotated for sensitivity to therapy and uncovers new components of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
The liver can substantially regenerate after injury, with both main epithelial cell types, hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells (BECs), playing important roles in parenchymal regeneration. Beyond metabolic functions, BECs exhibit substantial plasticity and in some contexts can drive hepatic repopulation. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to examine BEC and hepatocyte heterogeneity during homeostasis and after injury. Instead of evidence for a transcriptionally defined progenitor-like BEC cell, we found significant homeostatic BEC heterogeneity that reflects fluctuating activation of a YAP-dependent program. This transcriptional signature defines a dynamic cellular state during homeostasis and is highly responsive to injury. YAP signaling is induced by physiological bile acids (BAs), required for BEC survival in response to BA exposure, and is necessary for hepatocyte reprogramming into biliary progenitors upon injury. Together, these findings uncover molecular heterogeneity within the ductal epithelium and reveal YAP as a protective rheostat and regenerative regulator in the mammalian liver.

Abstract: Summary
Progression through states of pluripotency is required for cells in early mammalian embryos to transition away from heightened self-renewal and toward competency for lineage specification. Here, we use a CRISPR mutagenesis screen in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to identify unexpected roles for nuclear export and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis during the exit out of the naive state of pluripotency. Mutation of a plasma membrane Ca2+ pump encoded by Atp2b1 increased intracellular Ca2+ such that it overcame effects of intracellular Ca2+ reduction, which is required for naive exit. Persistent self-renewal of ESCs was supported both in Atp2b1−/− Tcf7l1−/− double-knockout ESCs passaged in defined media alone (no LIF or inhibitors) and in wild-type cells passaged in media containing only calcitonin and a GSK3 inhibitor. These new findings suggest a central role for intracellular Ca2+ in safeguarding naive pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
Tight junctions are cell-adhesion complexes that seal tissues and are involved in cell polarity and signaling. Supra-molecular assembly and positioning of tight junctions as continuous networks of adhesion strands are dependent on the membrane-associated scaffolding proteins ZO1 and ZO2. To understand how zona occludens (ZO) proteins organize junction assembly, we performed quantitative cell biology and in vitro reconstitution experiments. We discovered that ZO proteins self-organize membrane-attached compartments via phase separation. We identified the multivalent interactions of the conserved PDZ-SH3-GuK supra-domain as the driver of phase separation. These interactions are regulated by phosphorylation and intra-molecular binding. Formation of condensed ZO protein compartments is sufficient to specifically enrich and localize tight-junction proteins, including adhesion receptors, cytoskeletal adapters, and transcription factors. Our results suggest that an active-phase transition of ZO proteins into a condensed membrane-bound compartment drives claudin polymerization and coalescence of a continuous tight-junction belt.

Abstract: Summary
Current challenges in capturing naive human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) suggest that the factors regulating human naive versus primed pluripotency remain incompletely defined. Here we demonstrate that the widely used Essential 8 minimal medium (E8) captures hPSCs at a naive-to-primed intermediate state of pluripotency expressing several naive-like developmental, bioenergetic, and epigenomic features despite providing primed-state-sustaining growth factor conditions. Transcriptionally, E8 hPSCs are marked by activated lipid biosynthesis and suppressed MAPK/TGF-β gene expression, resulting in endogenous ERK inhibition. These features are dependent on lipid-free culture conditions and are lost upon lipid exposure, whereas short-term pharmacological ERK inhibition restores naive-to-primed intermediate traits even in the presence of lipids. Finally, we identify de novo lipogenesis as a common transcriptional signature of E8 hPSCs and the pre-implantation human epiblast in vivo. These findings implicate exogenous lipid availability in regulating human pluripotency and define E8 hPSCs as a stable, naive-to-primed intermediate (NPI) pluripotent state.

Abstract: Summary
We introduce APEX-seq, a method for RNA sequencing based on direct proximity labeling of RNA using the peroxidase enzyme APEX2. APEX-seq in nine distinct subcellular locales produced a nanometer-resolution spatial map of the human transcriptome as a resource, revealing extensive patterns of localization for diverse RNA classes and transcript isoforms. We uncover a radial organization of the nuclear transcriptome, which is gated at the inner surface of the nuclear pore for cytoplasmic export of processed transcripts. We identify two distinct pathways of messenger RNA localization to mitochondria, each associated with specific sets of transcripts for building complementary macromolecular machines within the organelle. APEX-seq should be widely applicable to many systems, enabling comprehensive investigations of the spatial transcriptome.

Abstract: Summary
Progressive degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) is the hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Limb-innervating lateral motor column MNs (LMC-MNs) seem to be particularly vulnerable and are among the first MNs affected in ALS. Here, we report association of this differential susceptibility with reduced expression of the mir-17∼92 cluster in LMC-MNs prior to disease onset. Reduced mir-17∼92 is accompanied by elevated nuclear PTEN in spinal MNs of presymptomatic SOD1G93A mice. Selective dysregulation of the mir-17∼92/nuclear PTEN axis in degenerating SOD1G93A LMC-MNs was confirmed in a double-transgenic embryonic stem cell system and recapitulated in human SOD1+/L144F-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MNs. We further show that overexpression of mir-17∼92 significantly rescues human SOD1+/L144F MNs, and intrathecal delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV)9-mir-17∼92 improves motor deficits and survival in SOD1G93A mice. Thus, mir-17∼92 may have value as a prognostic marker of MN degeneration and is a candidate therapeutic target in SOD1-linked ALS.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a major driver of transcriptome diversity in human cells. Here, we use deep learning to predict APA from DNA sequence alone. We trained our model (APARENT, APA REgression NeT) on isoform expression data from over 3 million APA reporters. APARENT’s predictions are highly accurate when tasked with inferring APA in synthetic and human 3′UTRs. Visualizing features learned across all network layers reveals that APARENT recognizes sequence motifs known to recruit APA regulators, discovers previously unknown sequence determinants of 3′ end processing, and integrates these features into a comprehensive, interpretable, cis-regulatory code. We apply APARENT to forward engineer functional polyadenylation signals with precisely defined cleavage position and isoform usage and validate predictions experimentally. Finally, we use APARENT to quantify the impact of genetic variants on APA. Our approach detects pathogenic variants in a wide range of disease contexts, expanding our understanding of the genetic origins of disease.

Abstract: Summary
Decision making is often driven by the subjective value of available options, a value which is formed through experience. To support this fundamental behavior, the brain must encode and maintain the subjective value. To investigate the area specificity and plasticity of value coding, we trained mice in a value-based decision task and imaged neural activity in 6 cortical areas with cellular resolution. History- and value-related signals were widespread across areas, but their strength and temporal patterns differed. In expert mice, the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) uniquely encoded history- and value-related signals with persistent population activity patterns across trials. This unique encoding of RSC emerged during task learning with a strong increase in more distant history signals. Acute inactivation of RSC selectively impaired the reward-history-based behavioral strategy. Our results indicate that RSC flexibly changes its history coding and persistently encodes value-related signals to support adaptive behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Chemotherapy is designed to induce cell death. However, at non-lethal doses, cancer cells can choose to remain proliferative or become senescent. The slow development of senescence makes studying this decision challenging. Here, by analyzing single-cell p21 dynamics before, during, and days after drug treatment, we link three distinct patterns of early p21 dynamics to final cell fate. Surprisingly, while high p21 expression is classically associated with senescence, we find the opposite at early times during drug treatment: most senescence-fated cells express much lower p21 levels than proliferation-fated cells. We demonstrate that these dynamics lead to a p21 “Goldilocks zone” for proliferation, in which modest increases of p21 expression can lead to an undesirable increase of cancer cell proliferation. Our study identifies a counter-intuitive role for early p21 dynamics in the cell-fate decision and pinpoints a source of proliferative cancer cells that can emerge after exposure to non-lethal doses of chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Knowledge abstracted from previous experiences can be transferred to aid new learning. Here, we asked whether such abstract knowledge immediately guides the replay of new experiences. We first trained participants on a rule defining an ordering of objects and then presented a novel set of objects in a scrambled order. Across two studies, we observed that representations of these novel objects were reactivated during a subsequent rest. As in rodents, human “replay” events occurred in sequences accelerated in time, compared to actual experience, and reversed their direction after a reward. Notably, replay did not simply recapitulate visual experience, but followed instead a sequence implied by learned abstract knowledge. Furthermore, each replay contained more than sensory representations of the relevant objects. A sensory code of object representations was preceded 50 ms by a code factorized into sequence position and sequence identity. We argue that this factorized representation facilitates the generalization of a previously learned structure to new objects.
