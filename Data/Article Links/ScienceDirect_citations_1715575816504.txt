Abstract: Summary
The molecular underpinnings of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) metastasis remain poorly defined. Here, using human LUAD cell lines, we find that transcriptional intermediary factor 1 γ (TIF1γ) binds to TATA box binding protein (TBP) in competition with TBP-associated factor 15 (TAF15) and impedes TAF15/TBP-mediated interleukin 6 (IL-6) transactivation. TIF1γ modifies TAF15 through multi-mono-ubiquitylation and drives nuclear export of TAF15. Functionally, TAF15 accelerates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis of LUAD cells, acting in just the opposite way as TIF1γ. Low TIF1γ or high TAF15 expression levels are shown in metastatic LUAD specimens and correlate with poor survival of individuals with LUAD. Our findings suggest that the TAF15/TBP complex is required for IL-6 activation-induced EMT and invasion, which are inhibited by TIF1γ. This study highlights the crucial interaction between TIF1γ and the TAF15/TBP complex for regulating EMT and metastasis in LUAD.

Abstract: Summary
A goal in visual neuroscience is to explain how neurons respond to natural scenes. However, neurons are generally tested using simpler stimuli, often because they can be transformed smoothly, allowing the measurement of tuning functions (i.e., response peaks and slopes). Here, we test the idea that all classic tuning curves can be viewed as slices of a higher-dimensional tuning landscape. We use activation-maximizing stimuli (“prototypes”) as landmarks in a generative image space and map tuning functions around these peaks. We find that neurons show smooth bell-shaped tuning consistent with radial basis functions, spanning a vast image transformation range, with systematic differences in landscape geometry from V1 to inferotemporal cortex. By modeling these trends, we infer that neurons in the higher visual cortex have higher intrinsic feature dimensionality. Overall, these results suggest that visual neurons are better viewed as signaling distances to prototypes on an image manifold.

Abstract: Binding of fluorescent ligand (FL) to the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-coupled ligand-binding domain of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (CFP-LBP) produces fluorescence (Förster) resonance energy transfer (FRET). A competitive fluorescent ligand assay (CFLA), using the FRET signal from competition between FLs and IP3, can measure IP3 concentration. The FRET signal should be enhanced by attaching a FRET donor to an appropriate position. Herein, we inserted five different circularly permuted CFPs in the loop between the second and third α-helices to generate membrane-targeted fluorescent ligand-binding proteins (LBPs). Two such proteins, LBP-cpC157 and LBP-cpC173, localized at the plasma membrane, displayed FRET upon binding the high-affinity ligand fluorescent adenophostin A (F-ADA), and exhibited a decreased fluorescence emission ratio (480 nm / 535 nm) by 1.6- to 1.8-fold that of CFP-LBP. In addition, binding of a fluorescent low-affinity ligand (F-LL) also reduced the fluorescence ratio in a concentration-dependent manner, with EC50 values for LBP-cpC157 and LBP-cpC173 of 34.7 nM and 27.6 nM, respectively. These values are comparable to that with CFP-LBP (29.2 nM), indicating that insertion of cpC157 and cpC173 did not disrupt LBP structure and function. The effect of 100 nM F-LL on the decrease in fluorescence ratio was reversed upon addition of IP3, indicating binding competition between F-LL and IP3. We also constructed cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins cyLBP-cpC157 and cyLBP-cpC173, and bound them to DYK beads for imaging analyses. Application of F-ADA decreased the fluorescence ratio of the beads from the periphery to the center over 3 − 5 min. Application of F-LL also decreased the fluorescence ratio of cyLBP-cpC157 and cyLBP-cpC173 by 20−25%, and subsequent addition of IP3 recovered the fluorescence ratio in a concentration-dependent manner. The EC50 value and Hill coefficient obtained by curve fitting against the IP3-dependent recovery of fluorescence ratio can be used to estimate the IP3 concentration.

Abstract: As a potential candidate to generate an everlasting cell source to treat various diseases, embryonic stem cells are regarded as a promising therapeutic tool in the regenerative medicine field. Cohesin, a multi-functional complex that controls various cellular activities, plays roles not only in organizing chromosome dynamics but also in controlling transcriptional activities related to self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells. Here, we report a novel role of the α-kleisin subunits of cohesin (RAD21 and REC8) in the maintenance of the balance between these two stem-cell processes. By knocking down REC8, RAD21, or the non-kleisin cohesin subunit SMC3 in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that reduction in cohesin level impairs their self-renewal. Interestingly, the transcriptomic analysis revealed that knocking down each cohesin subunit enables the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into specific lineages. Specifically, embryonic stem cells in which cohesin subunit RAD21 were knocked down differentiated into cells expressing neural alongside germline lineage markers. Thus, we conclude that cohesin appears to control the fate determination of embryonic stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Response to hypoxia is a highly regulated process, but little is known about single-cell responses to hypoxic conditions. Using fluorescent reporters of hypoxia response factor-1α (HIF-1α) activity in various cancer cell lines and patient-derived cancer cells, we show that hypoxic responses in individual cancer cells can be highly dynamic and variable. These responses fall into three classes, including oscillatory activity. We identify a molecular mechanism that can account for all three response classes, implicating reactive-oxygen-species-dependent chaperone-mediated autophagy of HIF-1α in a subset of cells. Furthermore, we show that oscillatory response is modulated by the abundance of extracellular lactate in a quorum-sensing-like mechanism. We show that oscillatory HIF-1α activity rescues hypoxia-mediated inhibition of cell division and causes broad suppression of genes downregulated in cancers and activation of genes upregulated in many cancers, suggesting a mechanism for aggressive growth in a subset of hypoxic tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatozoa acquire fertilization potential during passage through a highly specialized region of the extratesticular ductal system known as the epididymis. In the absence of de novo gene transcription or protein translation, this functional transformation is extrinsically driven via the exchange of varied macromolecular cargo between spermatozoa and the surrounding luminal plasma. Key among these changes is a substantive remodeling of the sperm proteomic architecture, the scale of which has yet to be fully resolved. Here, we have exploited quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to define the extent of changes associated with the maturation of mouse spermatozoa; reporting the identity of >6,000 proteins, encompassing the selective loss and gain of several hundred proteins. Further, we demonstrate epididymal-driven activation of RHOA-mediated signaling pathways is an important component of sperm maturation. These data contribute molecular insights into the complexity of proteomic changes associated with epididymal sperm maturation.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing depends on PAM recognition to initiate DNA unwinding. PAM mutations can abolish Cas9 binding and prohibit editing. Here, we identified a Cas9 from the thermophile Alicyclobacillus tengchongensis for which the PAM interaction can be robustly regulated by DNA topology. AtCas9 has a relaxed PAM of N4CNNN and N4RNNA (R = A/G) and is able to bind but not cleave targets with mutated PAMs. When PAM-mutated DNA was in underwound topology, AtCas9 exhibited enhanced binding affinity and high cleavage activity. Mechanistically, AtCas9 has a unique loop motif, which docked into the DNA major groove, and this interaction can be regulated by DNA topology. More importantly, AtCas9 showed near-PAMless editing of supercoiled plasmid in E. coli. In mammalian cells, AtCas9 exhibited broad PAM preference to edit plasmid with up to 72% efficiency and effective base editing at four endogenous loci, representing a potentially powerful tool for near-PAMless editing.

Abstract: Summary
Checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but many patients show resistance. Here we perform integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses on emerging immuno-oncology targets across multiple clinical cohorts of melanoma under anti-PD-1 treatment, on both bulk and single-cell levels. We reveal a surprising role of tumor-intrinsic SIRPA in enhancing antitumor immunity, in contrast to its well-established role as a major inhibitory immune modulator in macrophages. The loss of SIRPA expression is a marker of melanoma dedifferentiation, a key phenotype linked to immunotherapy efficacy. Inhibition of SIRPA in melanoma cells abrogates tumor killing by activated CD8+ T cells in a co-culture system. Mice bearing SIRPA-deficient melanoma tumors show no response to anti-PD-L1 treatment, whereas melanoma-specific SIRPA overexpression significantly enhances immunotherapy response. Mechanistically, SIRPA is regulated by its pseudogene, SIRPAP1. Our results suggest a complicated role of SIRPA in the tumor ecosystem, highlighting cell-type-dependent antagonistic effects of the same target on immunotherapy.

Abstract: Synaptic accumulation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) oligomers and their interactions with VAMP2 have been reported to be the basis of synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease (PD). α-Syn mutants associated with familial PD have also been known to be capable of interacting with VAMP2, but the exact mechanisms resulting from those interactions to eventual synaptic dysfunction are still unclear. Here, we investigate the effect of α-Syn mutant oligomers comprising A30P, E46K, and A53T on VAMP2-embedded vesicles. Specifically, A30P and A53T oligomers cluster vesicles in the presence of VAMP2, which is a shared mechanism with wild type α-Syn oligomers induced by dopamine. On the other hand, E46K oligomers reduce the membrane mobility of the planar bilayers, as revealed by single-particle tracking, and permeabilize the membranes in the presence of VAMP2. In the absence of VAMP2 interactions, E46K oligomers enlarge vesicles by fusing with one another. Our results clearly demonstrate that α-Syn mutant oligomers have aberrant effects on VAMP2-embedded vesicles and the disruption types are distinct depending on the mutant types. This work may provide one of the possible clues to explain the α-Syn mutant-type dependent pathological heterogeneity of familial PD.

Abstract: Summary
Changing composition of the gut microbiome is an important component of the gut adaptation to various environments, which have been implicated in various metabolic diseases including obesity and type 2 diabetes, but the mechanisms by which the microbiota influence host physiology remain contentious. Here we find that both diets high in the fermentable fiber inulin and vertical sleeve gastrectomy increase intestinal expression and circulating levels of the anti-microbial peptide Reg3g. Moreover, a number of beneficial effects of these manipulations on gut function, energy balance, and glucose regulation are absent in Reg3g knockout mice. Peripheral administration of various preparations of Reg3g improves glucose tolerance, and this effect is dependent on the putative receptor Extl3 in the pancreas. These data suggest Reg3g acts both within the lumen and as a gut hormone to link the intestinal microbiome to various aspects of host physiology that may be leveraged for novel treatment strategies.

Tumoricidal effects of unprimed and curcumin-primed adipose-derived stem cells on human hepatoma HepG2 cells under oxidative conditions,

Abstract: Introduction
Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have been proven to have tumoricidal effects against hepatic cancer cell lines. However, it appears that exposure to oxidative microenvironment compromises the potential outcome of ASCs in real hepatoma. Herein, we aimed to examine the tumoricidal effects of ASCs under oxidative conditions and to investigate the impact of curcumin priming on ASCs’ therapeutic potential.
Methods
We used human hepatoma (HepG2) cells in a coculture system with unprimed or curcumin-primed ASCs (Cur-ASCs) under H2O2-induced oxidative conditions. To investigate HepG2 proliferation and death, MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and annexin V staining assays were performed. To determine the HepG2 migration and invasion potential, the scratch healing and the transwell invasion assays were performed. To evaluate the expression of apoptosis-protein markers, Western blotting was performed.
Results
Cur-ASCs suppressed HepG2 proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as prompted apoptosis more significantly compared to unprimed ASCs under oxidative conditions. Expressional studies also revealed an obvious decline in the BCL-2/BAX ratio in HepG2 cocultured with Cur-ASCs. In addition, we noticed a marked elevation of apoptosis and senescence in unprimed ASCs compared to Cur-ASCs after coculture experiments, which demonstrated that curcumin priming preserved the survival and growth potential of ASCs; hence, Cur-ASCs performed better tumoricidal functions under oxidative conditions.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that ASCs have the intrinsic ability to induce cell death in HepG2 cells; however, their functions can be compromised under oxidative conditions. We believe that curcumin priming is an effective approach for improving the therapeutic effectiveness of ASCs in the cancerous microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) occasionally occurs under obesity; however, factors modulating the natural history of fatty liver disease remain unknown. Since hypothalamic orexin that regulates physical activity and autonomic balance prevents obesity, we investigate its role in NASH development. Male orexin-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) show severe obesity and progression of NASH with fibrosis in the liver. Hepatic fibrosis also develops in ovariectomized orexin-deficient females fed an HFD but not ovariectomized wild-type controls. Moreover, long-term HFD feeding causes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in orexin-deficient mice. Intracerebroventricular injection of orexin A or pharmacogenetic activation of orexin neurons acutely activates hepatic mTOR-sXbp1 pathway to prevent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a NASH-causing factor. Daily supplementation of orexin A attenuates hepatic ER stress and inflammation in orexin-deficient mice fed an HFD, and autonomic ganglionic blocker suppresses the orexin actions. These results suggest that hypothalamic orexin is an essential factor for preventing NASH and associated HCC under obesity.

Abstract: Summary
An emerging view regarding neurodegenerative diseases is that discreet seeding of misfolded proteins leads to widespread pathology. However, the mechanisms by which misfolded proteins seed distinct brain regions and cause differential whole-brain pathology remain elusive. We used whole-brain tissue clearing and high-resolution imaging to longitudinally map pathology in an α-synuclein pre-formed fibril injection model of Parkinson’s disease. Cleared brains at different time points of disease progression were quantitatively segmented and registered to a standardized atlas, revealing distinct phases of spreading and decline. We then fit a computational model with parameters that represent α-synuclein pathology spreading, aggregation, decay, and gene expression pattern to this longitudinal dataset. Remarkably, our model can generalize to predicting α-synuclein spreading patterns from several distinct brain regions and can even estimate their origins. This model empowers mechanistic understanding and accurate prediction of disease progression, paving the way for the development and testing of therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Two-component systems (TCSs) consist of the biggest group of signal transduction pathways in biology. Although TCSs play key roles in sensing signals to sustain survival and virulence, the genome-wide regulatory variability and conservation and synergistic actions of global TCSs in response to external stimulus are still uncharacterized. Here, we integrate 120 transcriptome sequencing datasets and 38 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing datasets of the model phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae to illustrate how bacterial TCSs dynamically govern their regulatory roles under changing environments. We reveal themes of conservation and variability in bacterial gene regulations in response to changing environments by developing a network-based PSTCSome (Pseudomonas syringae TCS regulome) containing 232 and 297 functional genes under King’s B medium and minimal medium conditions, respectively. We identify 7 TCSs regulating the type III secretion system, motility, or exopolysaccharide production. Overall, this study represents an important source to study the plasticity of TCSs among other TCS-containing organisms.

Abstract: Summary
The evolution of feeding habits leads to speciation in insects. Bactrocera true fruit flies display diverse feeding habits across species. We combine behavioral and functional genomic studies to probe the divergence between the specialist B. minax and the generalist B. dorsalis. We find that both vision and olfaction contribute to their respective host preferences, with a dominant effect of vision over the olfaction in short range. Correspondingly, host location-related genes are significantly enriched in the phototransduction pathway, of which the long-wavelength rhodopsin confers the color preference in both species and has been subject to selection in the specialist. We also find a massive expansion of olfactory receptors in the generalist, along with signatures of conditional expression and positive selection. The phylogenetic context suggests an ancestrally important role of vision in the host location of Bactrocera, as well as the increased performance and plasticity of olfaction alongside the arising of generalism.

Abstract: Summary
Closed-loop interaction has the potential to regulate ongoing brain activity by continuously binding an external stimulation to specific dynamics of a neural circuit. Achieving interactive modulation requires a stable brain-machine feedback loop. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to maintain oscillatory brain activity in a desired state by delivering stimulation accurately aligned with the timing of each cycle. We develop a fast algorithm that responds on a cycle-by-cycle basis to stimulate basal ganglia nuclei at predetermined phases of successive cortical beta cycles in parkinsonian rats. Using this approach, an equilibrium emerges between the modified brain signal and feedback-dependent stimulation pattern, leading to sustained amplification or suppression of the oscillation depending on the phase targeted. Beta amplification slows movement speed by biasing the animal’s mode of locomotion. Together, these findings show that highly responsive, phase-dependent stimulation can achieve a stable brain-machine interaction that leads to robust modulation of ongoing behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Jagged1 (JAG1) is a Notch ligand that contact-dependently activates Notch receptors and regulates cancer progression. The JAG1 intracellular domain (JICD1) is generated from JAG1, like formation of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD1); however, the role of JICD1 in tumorigenicity has not been comprehensively elucidated. Here we show that JICD1 induces astrocytes to acquire several cancer stem cell properties, including tumor formation, invasiveness, stemness, and resistance to anticancer therapy. The transcriptome, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and proteomics analyses show that JICD1 increases SOX2 expression by forming a transcriptional complex with DDX17, SMAD3, and TGIF2. JICD1-driven tumorigenicity is directly regulated by SOX2. Our results demonstrate that, like NICD1, JICD1 acts as a transcriptional cofactor in formation of the DDX17/SMAD3/TGIF2 transcriptional complex, leading to oncogenic transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Within eukaryotic cells, translation is regulated independent of transcription, enabling nuanced, localized, and rapid responses to stimuli. Neurons respond transcriptionally and translationally to synaptic activity. Although transcriptional responses are documented in astrocytes, here we test whether astrocytes have programmed translational responses. We show that seizure activity rapidly changes the transcripts on astrocyte ribosomes, some predicted to be downstream of BDNF signaling. In acute slices, we quantify the extent to which cues of neuronal activity activate translation in astrocytes and show that this translational response requires the presence of neurons, indicating that the response is non-cell autonomous. We also show that this induction of new translation extends into the periphery of astrocytes. Finally, synaptic proteomics show that new translation is required for changes that occur in perisynaptic astrocyte protein composition after fear conditioning. Regulation of translation in astrocytes by neuronal activity suggests an additional mechanism by which astrocytes may dynamically modulate nervous system functioning.

Lateral septum modulates cortical state to tune responsivity to threat stimuli,

Abstract: Summary
Sudden unexpected environmental changes capture attention and, when perceived as potentially dangerous, evoke defensive behavioral states. Perturbations of the lateral septum (LS) can produce extreme hyperdefensiveness even to innocuous stimuli, but how this structure influences stimulus-evoked defensive responses and threat perception remains unclear. Here, we show that Crhr2-expressing neurons in mouse LS exhibit phasic activation upon detection of threatening but not rewarding stimuli. Threat-stimulus-driven activity predicts the probability but not vigor or type of defensive behavior evoked. Although necessary for and sufficient to potentiate stimulus-triggered defensive responses, LSCrhr2 neurons do not promote specific behaviors. Rather, their stimulation elicits negative valence and physiological arousal. Moreover, LSCrhr2 activity tracks brain state fluctuations and drives cortical activation and rapid awakening in the absence of threat. Together, our findings suggest that LS directs bottom-up modulation of cortical function to evoke preparatory defensive internal states and selectively enhance responsivity to threat-related stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
Modulation of individual macronutrients or caloric density is known to regulate host resistance to infection in mice. However, the impact of diet composition, independent of macronutrient and energy content, on infection susceptibility is unclear. We show that two laboratory rodent diets, widely used as standard animal feeds and experimental controls, display distinct abilities in supporting mice during influenza infection. Mice placed on the highly processed AIN93G showed increased mortality to infection compared with those on a grain-based chow diet, suggesting a detrimental role for highly processed food in host defense. We further demonstrate that the heightened susceptibility of AIN93G-fed mice was associated with the failure in homeostasis restoration mediated by the cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ. Our findings show that diet composition calibrates host survival threshold by regulating adaptive homeostasis and highlights a pivotal role for extrinsic signals in host phenotype and outcome of host-pathogen interaction.

Abstract: Voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channel dysfunction leads to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells and contributes to the development of type-2 diabetes (T2D). The role of the low-voltage gated T-type CaV channels in β-cells remains obscure. Here we have measured the global expression of T-type CaV3.2 channels in human islets and found that gene expression of CACNA1H, encoding CaV3.2, is negatively correlated with HbA1c in human donors, and positively correlated with islet insulin gene expression as well as secretion capacity in isolated human islets. Silencing or pharmacological blockade of CaV3.2 attenuates glucose-stimulated cytosolic Ca2+ signaling, membrane potential, and insulin release. Moreover, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ store depletion is also impaired in CaV3.2-silenced β-cells. The linkage between T-type (CaV3.2) and L-type CaV channels is further identified by the finding that the intracellular Ca2+ signaling conducted by CaV3.2 is highly dependent on the activation of L-type CaV channels. In addition, CACNA1H expression is significantly associated with the islet predominant L-type CACNA1C (CaV1.2) and CACNA1D (CaV1.3) genes in human pancreatic islets. In conclusion, our data suggest the essential functions of the T-type CaV3.2 subunit as a mediator of β-cell Ca2+ signaling and membrane potential needed for insulin secretion, and in connection with L-type CaV channels.

Abstract: Summary
During multicellular development, periodic spatial patterning systems generate repetitive structures, such as digits, vertebrae, and teeth. Turing patterning provides a foundational paradigm for understanding such systems. The simplest Turing systems are believed to require at least two morphogens to generate periodic patterns. Here, using mathematical modeling, we show that a simpler circuit, including only a single diffusible morphogen, is sufficient to generate long-range, spatially periodic patterns that propagate outward from transient initiating perturbations and remain stable after the perturbation is removed. Furthermore, an additional bistable intracellular feedback or operation on a growing cell lattice can make patterning robust to noise. Together, these results show that a single morphogen can be sufficient for robust spatial pattern formation and should provide a foundation for engineering pattern formation in the emerging field of synthetic developmental biology.

Abstract: Summary
Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) catalyzes the two-step carboxylation of pyruvate to produce oxaloacetate, playing a key role in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis in cells. Given its involvement in multiple diseases, PC has been regarded as a potential therapeutic target for obesity, diabetes, and cancer. Albeit acetyl-CoA has been recognized as the allosteric regulator of PC for over 60 years, the underlying mechanism of how acetyl-CoA induces PC activation remains enigmatic. Herein, by using time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy, we have captured the snapshots of PC transitional states during its catalytic cycle. These structures and the biochemical studies reveal that acetyl-CoA stabilizes PC in a catalytically competent conformation, which triggers a cascade of events, including ATP hydrolysis and the long-distance communication between the two reactive centers. These findings provide an integrated picture for PC catalysis and unveil the unique allosteric mechanism of acetyl-CoA in an essential biochemical reaction in all kingdoms of life.

Abstract: Purpose
To explore the regulation of SOCS3 in the JAK2/STAT3 pathway during vocal fold fibroblast activation after vocal fold injury.
Methods
Normal vocal fold fibroblasts (VFFs), injured VFFs, and simulated injured VFFs (normal VFFs supplemented with transforming growth factor beta [TGF-β]) were treated with a JAK2 inhibitor (AG490), and SOCS3 was overexpressed in each group. Type I collagen (COL1), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), SOCS3, JAK2, and STAT3 were detected using immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blotting.
Results
Compared with normal VFFs, expression of SOCS3 was lower, but p-JAK/p-STAT3 and JAK2/STAT3 were higher in injured and simulated injured VFFs. After the addition of AG490, COL1 and α-SMA expressions did not change significantly in normal VFFs but was significantly decreased in the other two groups. The protein and mRNA expression levels of SOCS3 were significantly increased, while those of p-JAK/p-STAT3 and JAK2/STAT3 were significantly decreased. When SOCS3 was overexpressed, the COL1 and α-SMA expression levels in normal VFFs were not altered significantly, whereas they were significantly decreased in injured and simulated injured VFFs. The expression of p-JAK2/p-STAT3 significantly decreased when SOCS3 was overexpressed in injured and simulated injured VFFs.
Conclusion
SOCS3 may regulate the activation of JAK2/STATA3 pathway after vocal fold injury. In addition, SOCS3 may inhibit excessive activation of vocal fold fibroblasts by downregulating JAK2/STAT3 in the early stages of vocal fold injury.

Abstract: Summary
We reconstructed 19,084 prokaryotic and 31,395 viral genomes from 787 Japanese gut metagenomes as Japanese metagenome-assembled genomes (JMAG) and Japanese Virus Database (JVD), which are large microbial genome datasets for a single population. Population-specific enrichment of the Bacillus subtilis and β-porphyranase among the JMAG could derive from the Japanese traditional food natto (fermented soybeans) and nori (laver), respectively. Dairy-related Enterococcus_B lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus were nominally associated with the East Asian-specific missense variant rs671:G>A in ALDH2, which was associated with dairy consumption. Of the species-level viral genome clusters in the JVD, 62.9% were novel. The β crAss-like phage composition was low among the Japanese but relatively high among African and Oceanian peoples. Evaluations of the association between crAss-like phages and diseases showed significant disease-specific associations. Our large catalog of virus-host pairs identified the positive correlation between the abundance of the viruses and their hosts.

Abstract: Summary
We report an approach to identify tumor-specific CD4+ T cell neo-epitopes of both mouse and human cancer cells by analysis of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-eluted natural peptides. MHC class II-presented peptide sequences are identified by introducing the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) in tumor cells that were originally MHC class II negative. CIITA expression facilitates cell-surface expression of MHC class II molecules and the appropriate peptide-loading machinery. Peptide elution of purified MHC class II molecules and subsequent mass spectrometry reveals oncoviral- and neo-epitopes as well as shared epitopes. Immunological relevance of these epitopes is shown by natural presentation by dendritic cells and immunogenicity. Synthetic peptide vaccination induced functional CD4+ T cell responses, which helped tumor control in vivo. Thus, this CIITA transfection approach aids to identify relevant T helper epitopes presented by any MHC class II allele that would be otherwise very difficult to predict and reveals important targets for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The progressive nature of demyelinating diseases lies in the inability of the central nervous system (CNS) to induce proper remyelination. Recently, we and others demonstrated that a dysregulated innate immune response partially underlies failure of CNS remyelination. Extensive accumulation of myelin-derived lipids and an inability to process these lipids was found to induce a disease-promoting phagocyte phenotype. Hence, restoring the ability of these phagocytes to metabolize and efflux myelin-derived lipids represents a promising strategy to promote remyelination. Here, we show that ApoA-I mimetic peptide 5A, a molecule well known to promote activity of the lipid efflux transporter ABCA1, markedly enhances remyelination. Mechanistically, we find that the repair-inducing properties of 5A are attributable to increased clearance and metabolism of remyelination-inhibiting myelin debris via the fatty acid translocase protein CD36, which is transcriptionally controlled by the ABCA1-JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Altogether, our findings indicate that 5A promotes remyelination by stimulating clearance and degradation of myelin debris.

Abstract: Background
Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a difficult clinical condition with no effective treatment and a high mortality rate. Patients usually die of respiratory failure. In the present, we hypothesized that resveratrol (Res) could suppress bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF in rats and examined the detailed mechanism.
Methods
The successfully established BLM-induced PF rat models and normal healthy rats were randomly assigned into the control, model, Res-low, Res-medium, and Res-high groups. The extent of PF in rats was determined by Masson and H&E staining. ELISA was used to detect changes in the inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, SOD, and GSH-PX in lung tissue. Microscopic lung fibrosis scoring was done using the Ashcroft scale. Western blotting and RT-qPCR assays were used to analyze the effects of Res on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
Results
The administration of Res ameliorated the BLM-induced PF in vivo. Res could inhibit pro-inflammatory factors and regulates oxidative stress levels. It also revealed that Res downregulated Vimentin and upregulated E-cadherin expression. Res inhibited fibrosis and inflammatory responses in rat lung tissue. The activation of the TLR4/NF-κB and TGF-β1/smad3 signaling pathways were inhibited following Res treatment.
Conclusion
The present study suggested that Res may protect against BLM-induced PF by inhibiting the EMT and down-regulating the TLR4/NF-κB and TGF-β1/smad3 signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptation in CRISPR-Cas systems immunizes bacteria and archaea against mobile genetic elements. In many DNA-targeting systems, the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex is required for selection and processing of DNA segments containing PAM sequences prior to integration of these “prespacer” substrates as spacers in the CRISPR array. We determined cryo-EM structures of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 adaptation complex from the type I-C system that encodes standalone Cas1 and Cas4 proteins. The structures reveal how Cas4 specifically reads out bases within the PAM sequence and how interactions with both Cas1 and Cas2 activate Cas4 endonuclease activity. The Cas4-PAM interaction ensures tight binding between the adaptation complex and the prespacer, significantly enhancing integration of the non-PAM end into the CRISPR array and ensuring correct spacer orientation. Corroborated with our biochemical results, Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 structures with substrates representing various stages of CRISPR adaptation reveal a temporally resolved mechanism for maturation and integration of functional spacers into the CRISPR array.

Abstract: Summary
Long-term impacts of diet have been well studied; however, the immediate response of the intestinal epithelium to a change in nutrients remains poorly understood. We use physiological metrics and single-cell transcriptomics to interrogate the intestinal epithelial cell response to a high-fat diet (HFD). Within 1 day of HFD exposure, mice exhibit altered whole-body physiology and increased intestinal epithelial proliferation. Single-cell transcriptional analysis on day 1 reveals a cell-stress response in intestinal crypts and a shift toward fatty acid metabolism. By 3 days of HFD, computational trajectory analysis suggests an emergence of progenitors, with a transcriptional profile shifting from secretory populations toward enterocytes. Furthermore, enterocytes upregulate lipid absorption genes and show increased lipid absorption in vivo over 7 days of HFD. These findings demonstrate the rapid intestinal epithelial response to a dietary change and help illustrate the essential ability of animals to adapt to shifting nutritional environments.

Abstract: Summary
Long-term maintenance of the adult neurogenic niche depends on proper regulation of entry and exit from quiescence. Neural stem cell (NSC) transition from quiescence to activation is a complex process requiring precise cell-cycle control coordinated with transcriptional and morphological changes. How NSC fate transitions in coordination with the cell-cycle machinery remains poorly understood. Here we show that the Rb/E2F axis functions by linking the cell-cycle machinery to pivotal regulators of NSC fate. Deletion of Rb family proteins results in activation of NSCs, inducing a transcriptomic transition toward activation. Deletion of their target activator E2Fs1/3 results in intractable quiescence and cessation of neurogenesis. We show that the Rb/E2F axis mediates these fate transitions through regulation of factors essential for NSC function, including REST and ASCL1. Thus, the Rb/E2F axis is an important regulator of NSC fate, coordinating cell-cycle control with NSC activation and quiescence fate transitions.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are integral to the solid tumor microenvironment. CAFs were once thought to be a relatively uniform population of matrix-producing cells, but single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed diverse CAF phenotypes. Here, we further probed CAF heterogeneity with a comprehensive multiomics approach. Using paired, same-cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptome analysis, we provided an integrated analysis of CAF subpopulations over a complex spatial transcriptomic and proteomic landscape to identify three superclusters: steady state-like (SSL), mechanoresponsive (MR), and immunomodulatory (IM) CAFs. These superclusters are recapitulated across multiple tissue types and species. Selective disruption of underlying mechanical force or immune checkpoint inhibition therapy results in shifts in CAF subpopulation distributions and affected tumor growth. As such, the balance among CAF superclusters may have considerable translational implications. Collectively, this research expands our understanding of CAF biology, identifying regulatory pathways in CAF differentiation and elucidating therapeutic targets in a species- and tumor-agnostic manner.

Abstract: Summary
We combined functional genomics and human genetics to investigate processes that affect type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk by mediating beta cell survival in response to proinflammatory cytokines. We mapped 38,931 cytokine-responsive candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in beta cells using ATAC-seq and snATAC-seq and linked them to target genes using co-accessibility and HiChIP. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen in EndoC-βH1 cells, we identified 867 genes affecting cytokine-induced survival, and genes promoting survival and up-regulated in cytokines were enriched at T1D risk loci. Using SNP-SELEX, we identified 2,229 variants in cytokine-responsive cCREs altering transcription factor (TF) binding, and variants altering binding of TFs regulating stress, inflammation, and apoptosis were enriched for T1D risk. At the 16p13 locus, a fine-mapped T1D variant altering TF binding in a cytokine-induced cCRE interacted with SOCS1, which promoted survival in cytokine exposure. Our findings reveal processes and genes acting in beta cells during inflammation that modulate T1D risk.

Abstract: This study is to investigate the effect of Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) on the occurrence and progression of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and its underlying mechanism. After the CCA cells were transfected with OE-KLF9 and/or sh-metallothionein 1 M (sh-MT1M), KLF9 and MT1M expression levels were measured. Likewise, the biological characteristics of CCA cells were measured, followed by detections of caspase3 activity and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein. Furthermore, the binding site of KLF9 and MT1M was predicted and verified. An in vivo model of CCA in nude mice was established where tumor volume and weight were recorded, in addition to tumor metastasis in the liver. The expression of KLF9 and MT1M in the CCA cells was remarkably lower. CCA cells overexpressing KLF9 showed repressed abilities to proliferate, invade, and migrate, and strengthened cell apoptosis. KLF9 inhibited EMT, growth, and migration of CCA cells by modulating MT1M transcription. Additionally, KLF9 facilitated MT1M expression in vivo and improve the progression of CCA in nude mice. KLF9 acted as a transcription factor of MT1M to promote its transcription level, thereby affecting the growth and migration of CCA cells, and ultimately improving the occurrence and development of CCA.

Abstract: Repairing damaged DNA and removing all physical connections between sister chromosomes is important to ensure proper chromosomal segregation by contributing to chromosomal stability. Here, we show that the depletion of non-SMC condensin I complex subunit H (NCAPH) exacerbates chromosome segregation errors and cytokinesis failure owing to sister-chromatid intertwinement, which is distinct from the ultra-fine DNA bridges induced by DNA inter-strand crosslinks (DNA-ICLs). Importantly, we identified an interaction between NCAPH and GEN1 in the chromatin involving binding at the N-terminus of NCAPH. DNA-ICL activation, using ICL-inducing agents, increased the expression and interaction between NCAPH and GEN1 in the soluble nuclear and chromatin, indicating that the NCAPH–GEN1 interaction participates in repairing DNA damage. Moreover, NCAPH stabilizes GEN1 within chromatin at the G2/M-phase and is associated with DNA-ICL-induced damage repair. Therefore, NCAPH resolves DNA-ICL-induced ultra-fine DNA bridges by stabilizing GEN1 and ensures proper chromosome separation and chromosome structural stability.

Abstract: Summary
How fragile X syndrome protein (FMRP) binds mRNAs and regulates mRNA metabolism remains unclear. Our previous work using human neuronal cells focused on mRNAs targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which we showed are generally bound by FMRP and destabilized upon FMRP loss. Here, we identify >400 high-confidence FMRP-bound mRNAs, only ∼35% of which are NMD targets. Integrative transcriptomics together with SILAC–LC-MS/MS reveal that FMRP loss generally results in mRNA destabilization and more protein produced per FMRP target. We use our established RIP-seq technology to show that FMRP footprints are independent of protein-coding potential, target GC-rich and structured sequences, and are densest in 5′ UTRs. Regardless of where within an mRNA FMRP binds, we find that FMRP protects mRNAs from deadenylation and directly binds the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein. Our results reveal how FMRP sequesters polyadenylated mRNAs into stabilized and translationally repressed complexes, whose regulation is critical for neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
There are hundreds of risk genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but signaling networks at the protein level remain unexplored. We use neuron-specific proximity-labeling proteomics (BioID2) to identify protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for 41 ASD risk genes. Neuron-specific PPI networks, including synaptic transmission proteins, are disrupted by de novo missense variants. The PPI network map reveals convergent pathways, including mitochondrial/metabolic processes, Wnt signaling, and MAPK signaling. CRISPR knockout displays an association between mitochondrial activity and ASD risk genes. The PPI network shows an enrichment of 112 additional ASD risk genes and differentially expressed genes from postmortem ASD patients. Clustering of risk genes based on PPI networks identifies gene groups corresponding to clinical behavior score severity. Our data report that cell type-specific PPI networks can identify individual and convergent ASD signaling networks, provide a method to assess patient variants, and highlight biological insight into disease mechanisms and sub-cohorts of ASD.

Abstract: Summary
Codon usage of each genome is closely correlated with the abundance of tRNA isoacceptors. How codon usage bias is resolved by tRNA post-transcriptional modifications is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the N1-methylation of guanosine at position 37 (m1G37) on the 3′-side of the anticodon, while not directly responsible for reading of codons, is a neutralizer that resolves differential decoding of proline codons. A genome-wide suppressor screen of a non-viable Escherichia coli strain, lacking m1G37, identifies proS suppressor mutations, indicating a coupling of methylation with tRNA prolyl-aminoacylation that sets the limit of cell viability. Using these suppressors, where prolyl-aminoacylation is decoupled from tRNA methylation, we show that m1G37 neutralizes differential translation of proline codons by the major isoacceptor. Lack of m1G37 inactivates this neutralization and exposes the need for a minor isoacceptor for cell viability. This work has medical implications for bacterial species that exclusively use the major isoacceptor for survival.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA), which is susceptible to the accumulation of disease-causing mutations. To prevent deleterious mutations from being inherited, the female germline has evolved a conserved quality control mechanism that remains poorly understood. Here, through a large-scale screen, we uncover a unique programmed germline mitophagy (PGM) that is essential for mtDNA quality control. We find that PGM is developmentally triggered as germ cells enter meiosis by inhibition of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). We identify a role for the RNA-binding protein Ataxin-2 (Atx2) in coordinating the timing of PGM with meiosis. We show that PGM requires the mitophagy receptor BNIP3, mitochondrial fission and translation factors, and members of the Atg1 complex, but not the mitophagy factors PINK1 and Parkin. Additionally, we report several factors that are critical for germline mtDNA quality control and show that pharmacological manipulation of one of these factors promotes mtDNA quality control.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), a telomerase-independent process maintaining telomeres, is mediated by break-induced replication (BIR). RAD52 promotes ALT by facilitating D-loop formation, but ALT also occurs through a RAD52-independent BIR pathway. Here, we show that the telomere non-coding RNA TERRA forms dynamic telomeric R-loops and contributes to ALT activity in RAD52 knockout cells. TERRA forms R-loops in vitro and at telomeres in a RAD51AP1-dependent manner. The formation of R-loops by TERRA increases G-quadruplexes (G4s) at telomeres. G4 stabilization enhances ALT even when TERRA is depleted, suggesting that G4s act downstream of R-loops to promote BIR. In vitro, the telomeric R-loops assembled by TERRA and RAD51AP1 generate G4s, which persist after R-loop resolution and allow formation of telomeric D-loops without RAD52. Thus, the dynamic telomeric R-loops formed by TERRA and RAD51AP1 enable the RAD52-independent ALT pathway, and G4s orchestrate an R- to D-loop switch at telomeres to stimulate BIR.

Abstract: Summary
Manifestation of aggregate pathology in Huntington’s disease is thought to be facilitated by a preferential vulnerability of affected brain cells to age-dependent proteostatic decline. To understand how specific cellular backgrounds may facilitate pathologic aggregation, we utilized the yeast model in which polyQ-expanded Huntingtin forms aggregates only when the endogenous prion-forming protein Rnq1 is in its amyloid-like prion [PIN+] conformation. We employed optogenetic clustering of polyQ protein as an orthogonal method to induce polyQ aggregation in prion-free [pin−] cells. Optogenetic aggregation circumvented the prion requirement for the formation of detergent-resistant polyQ inclusions but bypassed the formation of toxic polyQ oligomers, which accumulated specifically in [PIN+] cells. Reconstitution of aggregation in vitro suggested that these polyQ oligomers formed through direct templating on Rnq1 prions. These findings shed light on the mechanism of prion-mediated formation of oligomers, which may play a role in triggering polyQ pathology in the patient brain.

Abstract: Summary
Calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated proteins (Camsaps) bind to the N-terminal domain of WD40-repeat 47 (Wdr47-NTD; featured with a LisH-CTLH motif) to properly generate axonemal central-pair microtubules (CP-MTs) for the planar beat pattern of mammalian motile multicilia. The underlying molecular mechanism, however, remains unclear. Here, we determine the structures of apo-Wdr47-NTD and Wdr47-NTD in complex with a characteristic Wdr47-binding region (WBR) from Camsap3. Wdr47-NTD forms an intertwined dimer with a special cross-over region (COR) in addition to the canonical LisH and globular α-helical core (GAC). The basic WBR peptide adopts an α-helical conformation and anchors to a tailored acidic pocket embedded in the COR. Mutations in this target-binding pocket disrupt the interaction between Wdr47-NTD and Camsap3. Impairing Wdr47-Camsap interactions markedly reduces rescue effects of Wdr47 on CP-MTs and ciliary beat of Wdr47-deficient ependymal cells. Thus, Wdr47-NTD functions by recognizing a specific basic helical motif in Camsap proteins via its non-canonical COR, a target-binding site in LisH-CTLH-containing domains.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies to deamidated gluten peptides are accurate diagnostic markers of celiac disease. However, binding of patient antibodies to all possible gluten epitopes has not previously been investigated. Here, we assess serum antibody specificity across the gluten proteome by use of high-density peptide arrays. We confirm the importance of deamidation for antibody binding, and we show that the response is remarkably focused on the known epitope QPEQPFP (where E results from deamidation of Q). In addition, we describe an epitope in native (non-deamidated) gluten, QQPEQII (where E is gene encoded), which is associated with both B cell and T cell reactivity. Antibodies to this native epitope are cross-reactive with the major deamidated epitope due to recognition of the shared PEQ motif. Since cross-reactive B cells can present peptides to different gluten-specific T cells, we propose that such B cells play a role in epitope spreading by engaging T cells with multiple specificities.

Abstract: Summary
The research of rare and devastating orphan diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has been limited by the rarity of the disease itself. The prognosis is poor—the prevalence of IPF is only approximately four times the incidence, limiting the recruitment of patients to trials and studies of the underlying biology. Global biobanking efforts can dramatically alter the future of IPF research. We describe a large-scale meta-analysis of IPF, with 8,492 patients and 1,355,819 population controls from 13 biobanks around the globe. Finally, we combine this meta-analysis with the largest available meta-analysis of IPF, reaching 11,160 patients and 1,364,410 population controls. We identify seven novel genome-wide significant loci, only one of which would have been identified if the analysis had been limited to European ancestry individuals. We observe notable pleiotropy across IPF susceptibility and severe COVID-19 infection and note an unexplained sex-heterogeneity effect at the strongest IPF locus MUC5B.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic adult stem cell lineages in high-turnover tissues are under tight gene regulatory control. Like its mammalian counterpart, the Drosophila intestine precisely adjusts the rate of stem cell division with the onset of differentiation based on physiological demand. Although Notch signaling is indispensable for these decisions, the regulation of Notch activity that drives the differentiation of stem cell progenies into functional, mature cells is not well understood. Here, we report that commitment to the terminally differentiated enterocyte (EC) cell fate is under microRNA control. We show that an intestinally enriched microRNA, miR-956, fine-tunes Notch signaling activity specifically in intermediate, enteroblast (EB) progenitor cells to control EC differentiation. We further identify insensitive mRNA as a target of miR-956 that regulates EB/EC ratios by repressing Notch activity in EBs. In summary, our study highlights a post-transcriptional gene-regulatory mechanism for controlling differentiation in an adult intestinal stem cell lineage.

Abstract: Summary
Claudins are a family of transmembrane proteins expressed in epithelial tissues and are the major components of tight junctions (TJs), which define barrier properties in epithelia and maintain cell polarity. How claudins regulate the formation of TJs and which functions they exert outside of them is not entirely understood. Although the long and unstructured C-terminal tail is essential for regulation, it is unclear how it is involved in these functions beyond interacting with TJ-associated proteins such as TJ protein ZO-1 (TJP1). Here, we present an interactome study of the pan-claudin family in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)-C7 cells by combining two complementary mass spectrometry-based pull-down techniques creating an interaction landscape of the entire claudin family. The interaction partners of the claudins’ C termini reveal their possible implications in localized biological processes in epithelial cells and their regulation by post-translational modifications (PTMs).

Abstract: Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a highly aggressive pediatric malignancy with no effective therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to identify a target for the development of novel molecule-targeting therapeutic agents. In this study, we report the importance of the runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) and RUNX1–Baculoviral IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) Repeat-Containing 5 (BIRC5/survivin) axis in the proliferation of MRT cells, as it can be used as an ideal target for anti-tumor strategies. The mechanism of this reaction can be explained by the interaction of RUNX1 with the RUNX1-binding DNA sequence located in the survivin promoter and its positive regulation. Specific knockdown of RUNX1 led to decreased expression of survivin, which subsequently suppressed the proliferation of MRT cells in vitro and in vivo. We also found that our novel RUNX inhibitor, Chb-M, which switches off RUNX1 using alkylating agent-conjugated pyrrole-imidazole polyamides designed to specifically bind to consensus RUNX-binding sequences (5′-TGTGGT-3′), inhibited survivin expression in vivo. Taken together, we identified a novel interaction between RUNX1 and survivin in MRT. Therefore the negative regulation of RUNX1 activity may be a novel strategy for MRT treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial perturbations within neurons communicate stress signals to peripheral tissues, coordinating organismal-wide mitochondrial homeostasis for optimal fitness. However, the neuronal control of the systemic stress regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we identified a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), SRZ-75, that couples with Gαq signaling in a pair of chemosensory ADL neurons to drive the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) activation in the intestine via the release of neuropeptides in Caenorhabditis elegans. Constitutive activation of Gαq signaling in the ADL neurons is sufficient to induce the intestinal UPRmt, leading to increased stress resistance and metabolic adaptations. Ablation of ADL neurons attenuates the intestinal UPRmt activation in response to various forms of neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, GPCR and its Gαq downstream signaling in two sensory neurons coordinate the systemic UPRmt activation, representing a previously uncharacterized, but potentially conserved, neuronal signaling for organismal-wide mitochondrial stress regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The two doublet histones of Marseillevirus are distantly related to the four eukaryotic core histones and wrap 121 base pairs of DNA to form remarkably similar nucleosomes. By permeabilizing Marseillevirus virions and performing genome-wide nuclease digestion, chemical cleavage, and mass spectrometry assays, we find that the higher-order organization of Marseillevirus chromatin fundamentally differs from that of eukaryotes. Marseillevirus nucleosomes fully protect DNA within virions as closely abutted 121-bp DNA-wrapped cores without linker DNA or phasing along genes. Likewise, we observed that nucleosomes reconstituted onto multi-copy tandem repeats of a nucleosome-positioning sequence are tightly packed. Dense promiscuous packing of fully wrapped nucleosomes rather than “beads on a string” with genic punctuation represents a distinct mode of DNA packaging by histones. We suggest that doublet histones have evolved for viral genome protection and may resemble an early stage of histone differentiation leading to the eukaryotic octameric nucleosome.

Abstract: Summary
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) comprises more than 30 nucleoporins (NUPs) and is a hallmark of eukaryotes. NUPs have been suggested to be important in regulating gene transcription and 3D genome organization. However, evidence in support of their direct roles remains limited. Here, by Cut&Run, we find that core NUPs display broad but also cell-type-specific association with active promoters and enhancers in human cells. Auxin-mediated rapid depletion of two NUPs demonstrates that NUP93, but not NUP35, directly and specifically controls gene transcription.

Abstract: The research objective was to identify helminths in guinea pigs from processing centers in the city of Cajamarca, determining the frequency, morphometric characteristics, parasite gender, and location. The diagnosis of intestinal parasites was made by examining and opening the postmortem gastrointestinal tract and the morphometric characteristics were determined using a millimetric ruler, micrometric eyepiece, microscope, and stereoscope. At the end of the investigation, a frequency of 76% of nematodes was found, which according to morphometry correspond to Paraspidodera uncinata (74%), Capillaria spp. (18%), and Trichuris spp. (14%); according to location 18% were found in the small intestine (Capillaria spp. 18%), 72% in the cecum (58% correspond only to P. uncinata, 3% to Trichuris spp. and 11% to a mixed infection between both) and 23% in the colon (P. uncinata); no parasites were found in liver or stomach. Nematodes in guinea pigs from Cajamarca is high, with a greater presence of P. uncinata, located in the cecum and colon.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has limited efficacy against solid tumors, and one major challenge is T cell exhaustion. To address this challenge, we performed a candidate gene screen using a hypofunction CAR-T cell model and found that depletion of basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor (BATF) improved the antitumor performance of CAR-T cells. In different types of CAR-T cells and mouse OT-1 cells, loss of BATF endows T cells with improved resistance to exhaustion and superior tumor eradication efficacy. Mechanistically, we found that BATF binds to and up-regulates a subset of exhaustion-related genes in human CAR-T cells. BATF regulates the expression of genes involved in development of effector and memory T cells, and knocking out BATF shifts the population toward a more central memory subset. We demonstrate that BATF is a key factor limiting CAR-T cell function and that its depletion enhances the antitumor activity of CAR-T cells against solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
A major issue in modern neuroscience is to understand how cell populations present multiple spatial and motor features during goal-directed movements. The direction and distance (depth) of arm movements often appear to be controlled independently during behavior, but it is unknown whether they share neural resources or not. Using information theory, singular value decomposition, and dimensionality reduction methods, we compare direction and depth effects and their convergence across three parietal areas during an arm movement task. All methods show a stronger direction effect during early movement preparation, whereas depth signals prevail during movement execution. Going from anterior to posterior sectors, we report an increased number of cells processing both signals and stronger depth effects. These findings suggest a serial direction and depth processing consistent with behavioral evidence and reveal a gradient of joint versus independent control of these features in parietal cortex that supports its role in sensorimotor transformations.

Abstract: Objective
Ferroptosis is a novel mode of non-apoptotic cell death induced by build-up of toxic lipid peroxides (lipid-ROS) in an iron dependent manner, which is a key event in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cardiomyocytes damages. Studies indicated that ischemic preconditioning with cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) protected against I/R-induced cardiomyocytes damages. However, the role of hypoxia-conditioned CMECs-derived Exo (H-exo) in I/R cardiomyocytes damages remains largely unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the role and underlying mechanisms of H-exo in hypoxia/reoxygenation(H/R)-induced H9C2 cells damages.
Methods
The rat CMECs were subjected to hypoxia or normoxia culture and Exo was subsequently collected and identified. H-exo or normoxia-conditioned CMECs-derived Exo (N-exo) were administered to H9C2 cells with H/R. To evaluate the therapeutic effect of H-exo and H-exo on H/R-induced H9C2 cells damages, cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay and Edu staining, and ferroptosis process were evaluated by iron ion concentration, lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) level, and the protein expression of ferroptosis markers. Mechanically, we utilized the RT-qPCR to identify the expression of candidate miR-210–3p in N-exo and H-exo. Bioinformatics combined with dual luciferase reporter assay disclosed the downstream molecular mechanism of miR-210–3p.
Results
The results indicated that both H-exo and N-exo significantly facilitated cell proliferation, increased GSH-Px levels and ferroptosis marker (GPX4) protein levels, and reduced iron ion concentration, lipid ROS level, MDA levels and ferroptosis markers (ACSL4 and PTGS2) protein levels in H/R-treated H9C2 cells. More importantly, the therapeutic effect of H-exo was significantly better than that of N-exo. Mechanistically, the results of RT-qPCR revealed significant enrichment of miR-210–3p in H-exo compared with N-exo. The miR-210–3p delivered by H-exo inhibited TFR expression by directly interacting with TFR mRNA, resulting in the promotion of cell proliferation and the attenuation of cell ferroptosis in H/R-treated H9C2 cells.
Conclusion
All these data demonstrated that H-exo derived miR-210–3p facilitated the proliferation of myocardial cells in H/R-treated H9C2 cells by suppressing TFR-mediated ferroptosis, which provided new methods to treat H/R-induced myocardial injury.

Abstract: Summary
Interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) repair by the canonical Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway generates double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are subsequently repaired by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Recent studies show that the NEIL3 DNA glycosylase repairs psoralen-ICLs by direct unhooking. However, whether and how NEIL3 regulates MMC and cisplatin-ICL repair remains unclear. Here we show that NEIL3 participates in DSB repair step of ICL repair by promoting HR pathway. Mechanistically, NEIL3 is recruited to the DSB sites through its GRF zinc finger motifs. NEIL3 interacts with the DSB resection machinery, including CtIP, the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, and DNA2, which is mediated by the GRF zinc finger motifs. In addition, NEIL3 is necessary for the chromatin recruitment of the resection machinery, and depletion of NEIL3 decreases end resection and compromises HR. Taken together, our results show that NEIL3 plays an important role in MMC/cisplatin-ICL repair by promoting the HR step in FA/BRCA pathway.

Abstract: Summary
When voluntary movements are executed under different contexts, different context-dependent signals are thought to weaken from secondary motor cortex (M2) to primary motor cortex (M1). However, it is unclear how the different contexts are processed from M2 to M1 to execute skilled movement. We conduct two-photon calcium imaging of M2 and M1 in mice performing internally generated and external-cue-triggered movements. Context dependency is consistently high in M2 L2/3 neurons and consistently low in M1 pyramidal tract neurons. By contrast, context dependency in M2 → M1 axons and M1 L2/3 neurons increases as task performance improves. In addition, the context dependency of M1 L2/3, but not M2 → M1 axons, is associated with fine-movement proficiency. The increase in context dependency correlates with stabilization of the context-dependent population activity and an increase in the neurons that strongly encode contextual and motor information. Thus, emergence of distinct context-dependent ensembles may be necessary for the context-to-motor transformation that facilitates skilled motor performance.

Abstract: Summary
Silencing of transposable elements (TEs) drives the evolution of numerous redundant mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. Arabidopsis MBD5, MBD6, and SILENZIO act as TE repressors downstream of DNA methylation. Here, we show, via single-nucleus RNA-seq of developing male gametophytes, that these repressors are critical for TE silencing in the pollen vegetative cell, a companion cell important for fertilization that undergoes chromatin decompaction. Instead, other silencing mutants (met1, ddm1, mom1, morc) show loss of silencing in all pollen nucleus types and somatic cells. We show that TEs repressed by MBD5/6 gain chromatin accessibility in wild-type vegetative nuclei despite remaining silent, suggesting that loss of DNA compaction makes them sensitive to loss of MBD5/6. Consistently, crossing mbd5/6 to histone 1 mutants, which have decondensed chromatin in leaves, reveals derepression of MBD5/6-dependent TEs in leaves. MBD5/6 and SILENZIO thus act as a silencing system particularly important when chromatin compaction is compromised.

Abstract: Summary
Biobanks facilitate genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which have mapped genomic loci across a range of human diseases and traits. However, most biobanks are primarily composed of individuals of European ancestry. We introduce the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI)—a collaborative network of 23 biobanks from 4 continents representing more than 2.2 million consented individuals with genetic data linked to electronic health records. GBMI meta-analyzes summary statistics from GWASs generated using harmonized genotypes and phenotypes from member biobanks for 14 exemplar diseases and endpoints. This strategy validates that GWASs conducted in diverse biobanks can be integrated despite heterogeneity in case definitions, recruitment strategies, and baseline characteristics. This collaborative effort improves GWAS power for diseases, benefits understudied diseases, and improves risk prediction while also enabling the nomination of disease genes and drug candidates by incorporating gene and protein expression data and providing insight into the underlying biology of human diseases and traits.

Abstract: Summary
The underlying cellular events driving kidney fibrogenesis and metabolic dysfunction are incompletely understood. Here, we employed single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing to analyze 24 mouse kidneys from two fibrosis models. We profiled 309,666 cells in one experiment, representing 50 cell types/states encompassing epithelial, endothelial, immune, and stromal populations. Single-cell analysis identified diverse injury states of the proximal tubule, including two distinct early-phase populations with dysregulated lipid and amino acid metabolism, respectively. Lipid metabolism was defective in the chronic phase but was transiently activated in the very early stages of ischemia-induced injury, where we discovered increased lipid deposition and increased fatty acid β-oxidation. Perilipin 2 was identified as a surface marker of intracellular lipid droplets, and its knockdown in vitro disrupted cell energy state maintenance during lipid accumulation. Surveying epithelial cells across nephron segments identified shared and unique injury responses. Stromal cells exhibited high heterogeneity and contributed to fibrogenesis by epithelial-stromal crosstalk.

Abstract: Summary
Therapies based on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) long-acting analogs and insulin are often used in the treatment of metabolic diseases. Both insulin and GLP-1 receptors are expressed in metabolically relevant brain regions, suggesting a cooperative action. However, the mechanisms underlying the synergistic actions of insulin and GLP-1R agonists remain elusive. In this study, we show that insulin-induced hypoglycemia enhances GLP-1R agonists entry in hypothalamic and area, leading to enhanced whole-body fat oxidation. Mechanistically, this phenomenon relies on the release of tanycyctic vascular endothelial growth factor A, which is selectively impaired after calorie-rich diet exposure. In humans, low blood glucose also correlates with enhanced blood-to-brain passage of insulin, suggesting that blood glucose gates the passage other energy-related signals in the brain. This study implies that the preventing hyperglycemia is important to harnessing the full benefit of GLP-1R agonist entry in the brain and action onto lipid mobilization and body weight loss.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-specific TERT promoter mutations have been linked to the reactivation of epigenetically silenced TERT gene by creating de novo binding motifs for E-Twenty-Six transcription factors, especially GABPA. How these mutations switch on TERT from epigenetically repressed states to expressed states have not been defined. Here, we revealed that EGFR activation induces ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) at Ser417 (S417), leading to interactions between ASL and GABPA at the mutant regions of TERT promoters. The ASL-generated fumarate inhibits KDM5C, leading to enhanced trimethylation of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4me3), which in turn promotes the recruitment of c-Myc to TERT promoters for TERT expression. Expression of ASL S417A, which abrogates its binding with GABPA, results in reduced TERT expression, inhibited telomerase activity, shortened telomere length, and impaired brain tumor growth in mice. This study reveals an unrecognized mechanistic insight into epigenetically activation of mutant TERT promoters where GABPA-interacted ASL plays an instrumental role.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling through innate immune receptors such as the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) superfamily proceeds via the assembly of large membrane-proximal complexes or “signalosomes.” Although structurally distinct, the IL-17 receptor family triggers cellular responses that are typical of innate immune receptors. The IL-17RA receptor subunit is shared by several members of the IL-17 family. Using a combination of crystallographic, biophysical, and mutational studies, we show that IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17A/F induce IL-17RA dimerization. X-ray analysis of the heteromeric IL-17A complex with the extracellular domains of the IL-17RA and IL-17RC receptors reveals that cytokine-induced IL-17RA dimerization leads to the formation of a 2:2:2 hexameric signaling assembly. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the formation of the IL-17 signalosome potentiates IL-17-induced IL-36γ and CXCL1 mRNA expression in human keratinocytes, compared with a dimerization-defective IL-17RA variant.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial malfunction and autophagy defects are often concurrent phenomena associated with neurodegeneration. We show that Miga, a mitochondrial outer-membrane protein that regulates endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial contact sites (ERMCSs), is required for autophagy. Loss of Miga results in an accumulation of autophagy markers and substrates, whereas PI3P and Syx17 levels are reduced. Further experiments indicated that the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes is defective in Miga mutants. Miga binds to Atg14 and Uvrag; concordantly, Miga overexpression results in Atg14 and Uvrag recruitment to mitochondria. The heightened PI3K activity induced by Miga requires Uvrag, whereas Miga-mediated stabilization of Syx17 is dependent on Atg14. Miga-regulated ERMCSs are critical for PI3P formation but are not essential for the stabilization of Syx17. In summary, we identify a mitochondrial protein that regulates autophagy by recruiting two alternative components of the PI3K complex present at the ERMCSs.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of the electron transport chain (ETC) prevents the regeneration of mitochondrial NAD+, resulting in cessation of the oxidative tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and a consequent dependence upon reductive carboxylation for aspartate synthesis. NAD+ regeneration alone in the cytosol can rescue the viability of ETC-deficient cells. Yet, how this occurs and whether transfer of oxidative equivalents to the mitochondrion is required remain unknown. Here, we show that inhibition of the ETC drives reversal of the mitochondrial aspartate transaminase (GOT2) as well as malate and succinate dehydrogenases (MDH2 and SDH) to transfer oxidative NAD+ equivalents into the mitochondrion. This supports the NAD+-dependent activity of the mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and thereby enables anaplerosis—the entry of glutamine-derived carbon into the TCA cycle and connected biosynthetic pathways. Thus, under impaired ETC function, the cytosolic redox state is communicated into the mitochondrion and acts as a rheostat to support GDH activity and cell viability.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional silencing through the Polycomb silencing machinery utilizes a “read-write” mechanism involving histone tail modifications. However, nucleation of silencing and long-term stable transmission of the silenced state also requires P-olycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) accessory proteins, whose molecular role is poorly understood. The Arabidopsis VEL proteins are accessory proteins that interact with PRC2 to nucleate and propagate silencing at the FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) locus, enabling early flowering in spring. Here, we report that VEL proteins contain a domain related to an atypical four-helix bundle that engages in spontaneous concentration-dependent head-to-tail polymerization to assemble dynamic biomolecular condensates.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic enzyme branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1) drives cell proliferation in aggressive cancers such as glioblastoma. Here, we show that BCAT1 localizes to mitotic structures and has a non-metabolic function as a mitotic regulator. Furthermore, BCAT1 is required for chromosome segregation in cancer and induced pluripotent stem cells and tumor growth in human cerebral organoid and mouse syngraft models. Applying gene knockout and rescue strategies, we show that the BCAT1 CXXC redox motif is crucial for controlling cysteine sulfenylation specifically in mitotic cells, promoting Aurora kinase B localization to centromeres, and securing accurate chromosome segregation. These findings offer an explanation for the well-established role of BCAT1 in promoting cancer cell proliferation. In summary, our data establish BCAT1 as a component of the mitotic apparatus that safeguards mitotic fidelity through a moonlighting redox functionality.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cell (DC) activation via pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is critical for antigen presentation and development of adaptive immune responses, but the stochastic distribution of DC responses to PAMP signaling, especially during the initial stages of immune activation, is poorly understood. In this study, we isolate a unique DC subpopulation via preferential phagocytosis of microparticles (MPs) and characterize this subpopulation of “first responders” (FRs). We present results that show these cells (1) can be isolated and studied via both increased accumulation of the micron-sized particles and combinations of cell surface markers, (2) show increased responses to PAMPs, (3) facilitate adaptive immune responses by providing the initial paracrine signaling, and (4) can be selectively targeted by vaccines to modulate both antibody and T cell responses in vivo. This study presents insights into a temporally controlled, distinctive cell population that influences downstream immune responses. Furthermore, it demonstrates potential for improving vaccine designs via FR targeting.

Abstract: Multiple organ toxicity has been associated with cisplatin (CIS) treatment, limiting its clinical use. The human prostate and seminal vesicles are accessory sex organs with androgen-dependent morphogenesis, growth, and secretion. The present study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the toxic effect of CIS on normal prostate and seminal vesicles in the presence and absence of diosmin (DS). The animals were randomized into 4 groups as follows: control (received vehicle), CIS group (7.5 mg/kg, i.p. on 5th and 12th day), DS group (100 mg/kg, p.o. for 15 days), and DS+CIS group. Histopathological and biochemical analyses were conducted to elucidate the goal of this study. CIS administration significantly induced prostate and seminal vesicle toxicity as evidenced by alteration of serum testosterone, LH, FSH, PSA, steroidogenic HSD17B6 as well as seminal analysis markers. Remarkably, marked histopathological changes in thin and ultrathin structures were observed. Besides, CIS significantly boosted oxidative stress as evidenced by the up-regulation of MDA and down-regulation of TAC. CIS significantly induced tissue apoptosis concomitant with suppression of cellular proliferation and stem cell expression as indicated by up-regulation of activated caspase-3 and Bax expression along with down-regulation of Bcl-2, Ki67, and CD44 expression. Interestingly, DS fixed all disturbances in the prostate and seminal vesicles induced by CIS. Together, CIS could cause prostate and seminal vesicle toxicity by affecting hormonal, steroidogenic, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and proliferation processes, and this effect was reversed by DS administration.

Abstract: Summary
Cells sense stress and initiate response pathways to maintain lipid and protein homeostasis. However, the interplay between these adaptive mechanisms is unclear. Herein, we demonstrate how imbalances in cytosolic protein homeostasis affect intracellular lipid surveillance. Independent of its ancient thermo-protective properties, the heat shock factor, HSF-1, modulates lipid metabolism and age regulation through the metazoan-specific nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-49. Reduced hsf-1 expression destabilizes the Caenorhabditis elegans enteric actin network, subsequently disrupting Rab GTPase-mediated trafficking and cell-surface residency of nutrient transporters. The ensuing malabsorption limits lipid availability, thereby activating the intracellular lipid surveillance response through vesicular release and nuclear translocation of NHR-49 to both increase nutrient absorption and restore lipid homeostasis. Overall, cooperation between these regulators of cytosolic protein homeostasis and lipid surveillance ensures metabolic health and age progression through actin integrity, endocytic recycling, and lipid sensing.

Abstract: Summary
The early gonads of mammals contain primordial germ cells (PGCs) and somatic cell precursors that are essential for sex determination and gametogenesis. Although it is extensively documented in mice, the development of early gonads in non-rodents remains to be delineated. Because molecular differences between mouse and human gonadal cells have been reported, it warrants the study of the key markers and regulatory features that are conserved or divergent between non-rodent species and human. Here, we integrate single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis to identify regulatory signatures of PGCs and somatic cells in the early gonads of goats, pigs, macaques, and humans. We identify the evolutionarily conserved and species-specific events, including genes expression, signaling pathways, and cell-cell interactions. We also uncover potential cis-regulatory elements and key transcription factors in PGCs and somatic cells. Our datasets provide important resources for better understanding the evolutionary programs of PGCs and gonadal somatic cell development in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
All metazoan guts are subject to opposing pressures wherein the immune system must eliminate pathogens while tolerating the presence of symbiotic microbiota. The Imd pathway is an essential defense against invading pathogens in insect guts, but tolerance mechanisms are less understood. Here, we find PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB express mainly in the anterior and middle midgut in a similar pattern to symbiotic Enterobacteriaceae bacteria along the Bactrocera dorsalis gut. Knockdown of PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB enhances the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes and reduces Enterobacteriaceae numbers while increasing abundance of opportunistic pathogens. Microbiota numbers recover to normal levels after the RNAi effect subsided. In contrast, high expression of PGRP-LC in the foregut allows increased antibacterial peptide production to efficiently filter the entry of pathogens, protecting the symbiotic bacteria. Our study describes a mechanism by which regional expression of PGRPs construct a protective zone for symbiotic microbiota while maintaining the ability to fight pathogens.

Phosphorylation of the DNA repair scaffold SLX4 drives folding of the SAP domain and activation of the MUS81-EME1 endonuclease,

Abstract: Summary
The DNA repair scaffold SLX4 has multifaceted roles in genome stability, many of which depend on structure-selective endonucleases. SLX4 coordinates the cell cycle-regulated assembly of SLX1, MUS81-EME1, and XPF-ERCC1 into a tri-nuclease complex called SMX. Mechanistically, how the mitotic kinase CDK1 regulates the interaction between SLX4 and MUS81-EME1 remains unclear. Here, we show that CDK1-cyclin B phosphorylates SLX4 residues T1544, T1561, and T1571 in the MUS81-binding region (SLX4MBR). Phosphorylated SLX4MBR relaxes the substrate specificity of MUS81-EME1 and stimulates cleavage of replication and recombination structures, providing a biochemical explanation for the chromosome pulverization that occurs when SLX4 binds MUS81 in S-phase. Remarkably, phosphorylation of SLX4MBR drives folding of an SAP domain, which underpins the high-affinity interaction with MUS81. We also report the structure of phosphorylated SLX4MBR and identify the MUS81-binding interface. Our work provides mechanistic insights into how cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation of SLX4 drives the recruitment and activation of MUS81-EME1.

Abstract: Communication between TRPC channels and IP3 receptors (IP3R) is considered pivotal in the generation of spatiotemporal Ca2+signaling patterns. Here we revisited the role of TRPC3-IP3R coupling for local Ca2+ signaling within TRPC3-harbouring micro/nanodomains using R-GECO as a reporter, fused to the channel´s C-terminus. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ changes at TRPC3 originated from both the entry of Ca2+ through the TRPC channel and Ca2+ mobilization via IP3R. Local Ca2+ changes at TRPC3 channels expressed in HEK293 cells were predominantly biphasic with IP3R-dependent initial Ca2+ transients, while exclusively monophasic signals were recorded when all three IP3R isoforms were lacking. Abrogation of Ca2+ entry through TRPC3 by point mutations, which impair Ca2+ permeability (E630Q), cation permeation (E630K), or DAG sensitivity (G652A), promoted microdomain Ca2+ oscillations. Ca2+ signals at E630Q, E630K, and G652A channels featured initial Ca2+ transients along with oscillatory activity. Similarly, when extracellular Ca2+ was omitted, IP3R-mediated Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ oscillations were promoted at the cytoplasmic face of wild-type TRPC3 channels. By contrast, oscillations, as well as initial Ca2+ transients, were virtually lacking, when the TRPC3 channels were sensitized by preexposure to low-level PLC activity. TIRF imaging provided evidence for dynamic colocalization of TRPC3 and IP3R. We suggest that TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry controls IP3R activity at ER-PM junctions to determine Ca2+ signaling signatures and enable specificity of downstream signaling.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNA (miRNA) and RNA interference (RNAi) pathways rely on small RNAs produced by Dicer endonucleases. Mammalian Dicer primarily supports the essential gene-regulating miRNA pathway, but how it is specifically adapted to miRNA biogenesis is unknown. We show that the adaptation entails a unique structural role of Dicer’s DExD/H helicase domain. Although mice tolerate loss of its putative ATPase function, the complete absence of the domain is lethal because it assures high-fidelity miRNA biogenesis. Structures of murine Dicer⋅miRNA precursor complexes revealed that the DExD/H domain has a helicase-unrelated structural function. It locks Dicer in a closed state, which facilitates miRNA precursor selection. Transition to a cleavage-competent open state is stimulated by Dicer-binding protein TARBP2. Absence of the DExD/H domain or its mutations unlocks the closed state, reduces substrate selectivity, and activates RNAi. Thus, the DExD/H domain structurally contributes to mammalian miRNA biogenesis and underlies mechanistical partitioning of miRNA and RNAi pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory signals are transmitted via the thalamus primarily to layer 4 (L4) of the primary sensory cortices. While information about average neuronal connectivity in L4 is available, its detailed higher-order circuit structure is not known. Here, we used three-dimensional electron microscopy for a connectomic analysis of the thalamus-driven inhibitory network in L4. We find that thalamic input drives a subset of interneurons with high specificity, which in turn target excitatory neurons with subtype specificity. These interneurons create a directed disinhibitory network directly driven by the thalamic input. Neuronal activity recordings show that strong synchronous sensory activation yields about 1.5-fold stronger activation of star pyramidal cells than spiny stellates, in line with differential windows of opportunity for activation of excitatory neurons in the thalamus-driven disinhibitory circuit model. With this, we have identified a high degree of specialization of the microcircuitry in L4 of the primary sensory cortex.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is detrimental to the immune system. It impairs lymphatics, T cell development, and lymphopoiesis; induces dysfunction of antitumor immunity; and also promotes tumor progression. However, direct evidence of the impact of obesity on viral infection is lacking. We report a protective role of obesity against herpes simplex virus 2 infection of the genital mucosa in mice. Although conventional antiviral immunity is comparable between obese mice and lean mice, obesity enhances the cytotoxic subset of γδ T cells. This effect is mediated by L-arginine produced by commensal microbiota in the genital mucosa, which induces “pseudonormoxia” of γδ T cells, resulting in increased natural killer (NK) group 2 D (NKG2D) expression of γδ T cells through the downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) by inducing nitric oxide (NO) production, thereby protecting mice from lethal genital herpes. Thus, our work illuminates one mechanism by which obesity-induced compositional changes in the vaginal microbiota can affect mucosal immune responses against viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription induces a wave of DNA supercoiling, altering the binding affinity of RNA polymerases and reshaping the biochemical landscape of gene regulation. As supercoiling rapidly diffuses, transcription dynamically reshapes the regulation of proximal genes, forming a complex feedback loop. However, a theoretical framework is needed to integrate biophysical regulation with biochemical transcriptional regulation. To investigate the role of supercoiling-mediated feedback within multi-gene systems, we model transcriptional regulation under the influence of supercoiling-mediated polymerase dynamics, allowing us to identify patterns of expression that result from physical inter-gene coupling. We find that gene syntax—the relative ordering and orientation of genes—defines the expression profiles, variance, burst dynamics, and inter-gene correlation of two-gene systems. Furthermore, supercoiling can enhance or weaken biochemical regulation. Our results suggest that supercoiling couples behavior between neighboring genes, providing a regulatory mechanism that tunes transcriptional variance in engineered gene networks and explains the behavior of co-localized native circuits.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons that process sensory information exhibit bursts of electrical activity during development, providing early training to circuits that will later encode similar features of the external world. In the mammalian auditory system, this intrinsically generated activity emerges from the cochlea prior to hearing onset, but its role in maturation of auditory circuitry remains poorly understood. We show that selective suppression of cochlear supporting cell spontaneous activity disrupts patterned burst firing of central auditory neurons without affecting cell survival or acoustic thresholds. However, neurons in the inferior colliculus of these mice exhibit enhanced acoustic sensitivity and broader frequency tuning, resulting in wider isofrequency laminae. Despite this enhanced neural responsiveness, total tone-responsive regions in the auditory cortex are substantially smaller. Thus, disruption of pre-hearing cochlear activity causes profound changes in neural encoding of sound, with important implications for restoration of hearing in individuals who experience reduced activity during this critical developmental period.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogens evade host humoral responses by accumulating mutations in surface antigens. While variable, there are conserved regions that cannot mutate without compromising fitness. Antibodies targeting these conserved epitopes are often broadly protective but remain minor components of the repertoire. Rational immunogen design leverages a structural understanding of viral antigens to modulate humoral responses to favor these responses. Here, we report an epitope-enriched immunogen presenting a higher copy number of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) receptor-binding site (RBS) epitope relative to other B cell epitopes. Immunization in a partially humanized murine model imprinted with an H1 influenza shows H1-specific serum and >99% H1-specific B cells being RBS-directed. Single B cell analyses show a genetically restricted response that structural analysis defines as RBS-directed antibodies engaging the RBS with germline-encoded contacts. These data show how epitope enrichment expands B cell responses toward conserved epitopes and advances immunogen design approaches for next-generation viral vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
In “healthy” tumor cells, phosphatidylserine (PS) is predominately localized in the inner plasma membrane leaflet. During apoptosis, PS relocates to the outer leaflet. Herein, we established PSout tumor models with tumor cells lacking PS flippase component CDC50A, constantly exposing PS but alive. PSout tumors developed bigger than wild-type (WT) tumors, featuring M2 polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and fewer tumor-antigen-specific T cells. The PS receptor TIM-3 is responsible for PS recognition. Employing an opposite tumor model, PSin, with tumor cells lacking the PS scramblase Xkr8 and unable to expose PS during otherwise normal apoptosis, we find that the accumulated apoptotic tumor cells produce and release cyclic GAMP (cGAMP) to immune cells to activate the STING pathway, leading to TAM M1 polarization, suppressed interleukin (IL)-10 secretion, and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. Silencing Xkr8 in vivo by either short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) to achieve a PS externalization blockade provides robust therapeutic anti-tumor efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Innate immunity is critical for the early detection and elimination of viral invasion. Extracellular signals are crucial for host resistance; however, how extracellular factors prepare the innate immunity for rapid antiviral response remains elusive. Here, we find that serum deprivation largely restricts the innate antiviral responses to RNA and DNA viruses. When serum is supplied, serine/threonine-protein kinase 38-like (STK38L), induced by serum response factor (SRF), phosphorylates IRF3 at Ser303, which prevents IRF3 from proteasome-mediated degradation in the rest state (non-infected), and ensures that enough IRF3 is called in the primed state (infected). STK38L-deficient mice exhibit compromised innate antiviral responses and elevated viral proliferation and mortality. Moreover, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), the crucial activators of SRF, rescue immunosuppression caused by serum deprivation. These findings identify the SRF-STK38L-IRF3 axis as a novel mechanism that maintains the host in a pro-active state when not infected, which ensures the rapid immune response against virus.

Abstract: Summary
Stress is a risk factor for emotion and energy metabolism disorders. However, the neurocircuitry mechanisms for emotion initiation and glucose mobilization underlying stress responses are unclear. Here we demonstrate that photoactivation of Gad2+ projection from the anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBNST) to the arcuate nucleus (ARC) induces anxiety-like behavior as well as acute hyperglycemia. Photoinhibition of the circuit is anxiolytic and blocks hyperglycemia induced by restraint stress. Pharmacogenetic inhibition of the ARCGad2+→raphe obscurus nucleus (ROb) and photoactivation of the aBNSTGad2+→ARC circuits simultaneously leads to significant hypoglycemia and anxiety-like behavior. Pharmacogenetic inhibition of the ARCGad2+→nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) whilst photoactivation of the aBNSTGad2+→ARC circuit only induces hyperglycemia. Our results reveal that the aBNSTGad2+→ARCGad2+→ROb circuit is recruited for the stress response of rapid glucose mobilization and the aBNSTGad2+→ARCGad2+→NTS circuit for behavioral symptoms of stress response. This study identifies a possible general strategy for neurocircuitry structural organization dealing with multiple organs involved in responses, with potential therapeutic targets for emotion and energy metabolism disorders underlying psychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Neurons make long-distance connections via their axons, and the accuracy and stability of these connections are crucial for brain function. Research using various animal models showed that the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the assembly and maintenance of neuronal circuitry are highly conserved in vertebrates. Therefore, to gain a deeper understanding of brain development and maintenance, an efficient vertebrate model is required, where the axons of a defined neuronal cell type can be genetically manipulated and selectively visualized in vivo. Placental mammals pose an experimental challenge, as time-consuming breeding of genetically modified animals is required due to their in utero development. Xenopus laevis, the most commonly used amphibian model, offers comparative advantages, since their embryos ex utero during which embryological manipulations can be performed. However, the tetraploidy of the X. laevis genome makes them not ideal for genetic studies. Here, we use Xenopus tropicalis, a diploid amphibian species, to visualize axonal pathfinding and degeneration of a single central nervous system neuronal cell type, the retinal ganglion cell (RGC). First, we show that RGC axons follow the developmental trajectory previously described in X. laevis with a slightly different timeline. Second, we demonstrate that co-electroporation of DNA and/or oligonucleotides enables the visualization of gene function-altered RGC axons in an intact brain. Finally, using this method, we show that the axon-autonomous, Sarm1-dependent axon destruction program operates in X. tropicalis. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the visual system of X. tropicalis is a highly efficient model to identify new molecular mechanisms underlying axon guidance and survival.

Abstract: Summary
In rodent motor cortex, the rostral forelimb area (RFA) and the caudal forelimb area (CFA) are major actors in orchestrating the control of complex forelimb movements. However, their intrinsic connectivity and reciprocal functional organization are still unclear, limiting our understanding of how the brain coordinates and executes voluntary movements. Here, we causally probe cortical connectivity and activation patterns triggered by transcranial optogenetic stimulation of ethologically relevant complex movements exploiting a large-scale all-optical method in awake mice. Results show specific activation features for each movement class, providing evidence for a segregated functional organization of CFA and RFA. Importantly, we identify a second discrete lateral grasping representation area, namely the lateral forelimb area (LFA), with unique connectivity and activation patterns. Therefore, we propose the LFA as a distinct forelimb representation in the mouse somatotopic motor map.

Abstract: Summary
Although macroautophagy deficits are implicated across adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases, we understand little about how the discrete, highly evolved cell types of the central nervous system use macroautophagy to maintain homeostasis. One such cell type is the oligodendrocyte, whose myelin sheaths are central for the reliable conduction of action potentials. Using an integrated approach of mouse genetics, live cell imaging, electron microscopy, and biochemistry, we show that mature oligodendrocytes require macroautophagy to degrade cell autonomously their myelin by consolidating cytosolic and transmembrane myelin proteins into an amphisome intermediate prior to degradation. We find that disruption of autophagic myelin turnover leads to changes in myelin sheath structure, ultimately impairing neural function and culminating in an adult-onset progressive motor decline, neurodegeneration, and death. Our model indicates that the continuous and cell-autonomous maintenance of the myelin sheath through macroautophagy is essential, shedding insight into how macroautophagy dysregulation might contribute to neurodegenerative disease pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
Oral and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are associated with high mortality, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying these malignancies are largely unclear. We show that DNA hypermethylation of otubain 2 (OTUB2), a previously recognized oncogene, drives tongue and esophageal SCC initiation and drug resistance. Mechanistically, OTUB2 promotes the deubiquitination and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and subsequently regulates the transcription of calmodulin-like protein 3 (CALML3). Activation of CALML3-mediated mitochondrial calcium signaling promotes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the synthesis of phosphatidylserine (PS). In mouse models, orally administered soybean-derived PS inhibits SCC initiation in cells with low OTUB2 expression and increases their sensitivity to chemotherapy. Our study indicates that the OTUB2/STAT1/CALML3/PS axis plays tumor-suppressive roles and shows the potential of PS administration as a strategy for the treatment and prevention of tongue and esophageal SCCs.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear pores are essential for nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. Whether and how cells change nuclear pores to alter nuclear transport and cellular function is unknown. Here, we show that rat heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) undergo a 63% decrease in nuclear pore numbers during maturation, and this changes their responses to extracellular signals. The maturation-associated decline in nuclear pore numbers is associated with lower nuclear import of signaling proteins such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Experimental reduction of nuclear pore numbers decreased nuclear import of signaling proteins, resulting in decreased expression of immediate-early genes. In a mouse model of high blood pressure, reduction of nuclear pore numbers improved adverse heart remodeling and reduced progression to lethal heart failure. The decrease in nuclear pore numbers in cardiomyocyte maturation and resulting functional changes demonstrate how terminally differentiated cells permanently alter their handling of information flux across the nuclear envelope and, with that, their behavior.

Abstract: Summary
The “last resort” pathway results in ubiquitylation and degradation of RNA polymerase II in response to transcription stress and is governed by factors such as Def1 in yeast. Here, we show that the SMY2 gene acts as a multi-copy suppressor of DEF1 deletion and functions at multiple steps of the last resort pathway. We also provide genetic and biochemical evidence from disparate cellular processes that Smy2 works more broadly as a hitherto overlooked regulator of Cdc48 function. Similarly, the Smy2 homologs GIGYF1 and -2 affect the transcription stress response in human cells and regulate the function of the Cdc48 homolog VCP/p97, presently being explored as a target for cancer therapy. Indeed, we show that the apoptosis-inducing effect of VCP inhibitors NMS-873 and CB-5083 is GIGYF1/2 dependent.

Abstract: Objective
To explore the mechanism of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR)-related lipid transfer domain containing 3 (STARD3) in breast cancer (BC).
Methods
We analysed the differential mRNA expressions of BC using ER+and ER-BC expression profiles from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). Expression and correlation between salient genes was visualized using microarray volcano plots and a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network map. Survival analyses were performed to identify the potential for STARD3 to serve as a prognostic biomarker. The expression of STARD3 was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The effects of STARD3 on apoptosis and proliferation of BC (MCF-7) cell line were deduced by flow cytometry, CCK8, and western blot (WB).
Results
STARD3 was the most differentially expressed gene (DEG). Patients in the STARD3 high expression group had significantly lower survival than those in the low expression group. The expression of STARD3 was significantly higher in BC tissues than controls. Inhibiting STARD3 expression significantly increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation, activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
Conclusion
Inhibiting the expression of STARD3 induced apoptosis via the inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway on BC inhibits tumour growth, which can be an effective therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Endocardial cells lining the heart lumen are coronary vessel progenitors during embryogenesis. Re-igniting this developmental process in adults could regenerate blood vessels lost during cardiac injury, but this requires additional knowledge of molecular mechanisms. Here, we use mouse genetics and scRNA-seq to identify regulators of endocardial angiogenesis and precisely assess the role of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling. Time-specific lineage tracing demonstrated that endocardial cells differentiated into coronary endothelial cells primarily at mid-gestation. A new mouse line reporting CXCR4 activity—along with cell-specific gene deletions—demonstrated it was specifically required for artery morphogenesis rather than angiogenesis. Integrating scRNA-seq data of endocardial-derived coronary vessels from mid- and late-gestation identified a Bmp2-expressing transitioning population specific to mid-gestation. Bmp2 stimulated endocardial angiogenesis in vitro and in injured neonatal mouse hearts. Our data demonstrate how understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying endocardial angiogenesis can identify new potential therapeutic targets promoting revascularization of the injured heart.

Abstract: Summary
Successful pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) immunotherapy necessitates optimization and maintenance of activated effector T cells (Teff). We prospectively collected and applied multi-omic analyses to paired pre- and post-treatment PDAC specimens collected in a platform neoadjuvant study of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting allogeneic PDAC vaccine (GVAX) vaccine ± nivolumab (anti-programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1]) to uncover sensitivity and resistance mechanisms. We show that GVAX-induced tertiary lymphoid aggregates become immune-regulatory sites in response to GVAX + nivolumab. Higher densities of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) following GVAX + nivolumab portend poorer overall survival (OS). Increased T cells expressing CD137 associated with cytotoxic Teff signatures and correlated with increased OS. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing found that nivolumab alters CD4+ T cell chemotaxis signaling in association with CD11b+ neutrophil degranulation, and CD8+ T cell expression of CD137 was required for optimal T cell activation. These findings provide insights into PD-1-regulated immune pathways in PDAC that should inform more effective therapeutic combinations that include TAN regulators and T cell activators.

Abstract: Summary
Kinesins are canonical molecular motors but can also function as modulators of intracellular signaling. KIF26A, an unconventional kinesin that lacks motor activity, inhibits growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2)- and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-dependent signal transduction, but its functions in the brain have not been characterized. We report a patient cohort with biallelic loss-of-function variants in KIF26A, exhibiting a spectrum of congenital brain malformations. In the developing brain, KIF26A is preferentially expressed during early- and mid-gestation in excitatory neurons. Combining mice and human iPSC-derived organoid models, we discovered that loss of KIF26A causes excitatory neuron-specific defects in radial migration, localization, dendritic and axonal growth, and apoptosis, offering a convincing explanation of the disease etiology in patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing in KIF26A knockout organoids revealed transcriptional changes in MAPK, MYC, and E2F pathways. Our findings illustrate the pathogenesis of KIF26A loss-of-function variants and identify the surprising versatility of this non-motor kinesin.

Abstract: Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes the disease tuberculosis and affects a third of the world’s population. The recent COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the situation with a projected 27% increase in tuberculosis related deaths. M. tuberculosis has an elaborate cell wall consisting of peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan and mycolic acids which shield the bacilli from the toxic bactericidal milieu within phagocytes. Amongst, the numerous glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in mycobacterial cell wall biosynthesis, arabinofuranosyltransferase C (aftC) is responsible for the branching of the arabinan domain in both arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan. Using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats interference (CRISPRi) we have generated aftC knockdowns in Mycobacterium bovis BCG and demonstrated the generation of a truncated, immunogenic lipoarabinomannan within its cell envelope. The aftC depleted BCG mutants were unable to form characteristic mycobacterial pellicular biofilms and elicit a potent immunostimulatory phenotype compared to wild type M. bovis BCG in a THP1 cell line. This study paves the way to further explore novel BCG mutants as promising vaccine boosters in preventing pulmonary tuberculosis.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria in biofilms are embedded in extracellular matrix and display low metabolic activity, partly due to insufficient diffusive exchange of metabolic substrate. The extracellular matrix and low metabolic activity both contribute to the high antibiotic tolerance—the hallmark of biofilm bacteria. The second messenger molecule, c-di-GMP, regulates biofilm development in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where high internal levels lead to biofilm formation and low levels are associated with planktonic bacteria. Using a microcalorimetric approach, we show that c-di-GMP signaling is a major determinant of the metabolic activity of P. aeruginosa, both in planktonic culture and in two biofilm models. The high c-di-GMP content of biofilm bacteria forces them to rapidly spend a large amount of energy on the production of exopolysaccharides, resulting in a subsequent low metabolic state. This suggests that the low metabolic state of bacteria in mature biofilms, to some extent, is a consequence of a c-di-GMP-regulated survival strategy.

Abstract: Summary
The dynamic regulation of β-cell abundance is poorly understood. Since chromatin remodeling plays critical roles in liver regeneration, these mechanisms could be generally important for regeneration in other tissues. Here, we show that the ARID1A mammalian SWI/SNF complex subunit is a critical regulator of β-cell regeneration. Arid1a is highly expressed in quiescent β-cells but is physiologically suppressed when β-cells proliferate during pregnancy or after pancreas resection. Whole-body Arid1a knockout mice are protected against streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Cell-type and temporally specific genetic dissection show that β-cell-specific Arid1a deletion can potentiate β-cell regeneration in multiple contexts. Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of mutant islets reveal increased neuregulin-ERBB-NR4A signaling. Chemical inhibition of ERBB or NR4A1 blocks increased regeneration associated with Arid1a loss. Mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) complex activity is a barrier to β-cell regeneration in physiologic and disease states.

Abstract: Summary
Microtubules have spatiotemporally complex posttranslational modification patterns. How cells interpret this tubulin modification code is largely unknown. We show that C. elegans katanin, a microtubule severing AAA ATPase mutated in microcephaly and critical for cell division, axonal elongation, and cilia biogenesis, responds precisely, differentially, and combinatorially to three chemically distinct tubulin modifications—glycylation, glutamylation, and tyrosination—but is insensitive to acetylation. Glutamylation and glycylation are antagonistic rheostats with glycylation protecting microtubules from severing. Katanin exhibits graded and divergent responses to glutamylation on the α- and β-tubulin tails, and these act combinatorially. The katanin hexamer central pore constrains the polyglutamate chain patterns on β-tails recognized productively. Elements distal to the katanin AAA core sense α-tubulin tyrosination, and detyrosination downregulates severing. The multivalent microtubule recognition that enables katanin to read multiple tubulin modification inputs explains in vivo observations and illustrates how effectors can integrate tubulin code signals to produce diverse functional outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Murine norovirus (MNoV) is a model for human norovirus and for interrogating mechanisms of viral tropism and persistence. We previously demonstrated that the persistent strain MNoVCR6 infects tuft cells, which are dispensable for the non-persistent strain MNoVCW3. We now show that diverse MNoV strains require tuft cells for chronic enteric infection. We also demonstrate that interferon-λ (IFN-λ) acts directly on tuft cells to cure chronic MNoVCR6 infection and that type I and III IFNs signal together via STAT1 in tuft cells to restrict MNoVCW3 tropism. We then develop an enteroid model and find that MNoVCR6 and MNoVCW3 similarly infect tuft cells with equal IFN susceptibility, suggesting that IFN derived from non-epithelial cells signals on tuft cells in trans to restrict MNoVCW3 tropism. Thus, tuft cell tropism enables MNoV persistence and is determined by tuft cell-intrinsic factors (viral receptor expression) and -extrinsic factors (immunomodulatory signaling by non-epithelial cells).

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute proteins are widespread in prokaryotes and eukaryotes with diversified catalytic activities. Here, we describe an Argonaute from Marinitoga hydrogenitolerans (MhAgo) with all eight cleavage activities. Utilization of all four types of guides and efficient cleavage of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA targets are revealed. The preference for the 5′-terminus nucleotides of 5′P guides, but no obvious preferences for that in 5′OH guides, is further uncovered. Moreover, the cleavage efficiency is heavily impaired by mismatches in the central and 3′-supplementary regions of guides, and the affinity between guides or guides/target duplex and MhAgo is proved as one of the factors affecting cleavage efficiency. Structural and mutational analyses imply some unknown distinctive structural features behind the cleavage activity of MhAgo. Meanwhile, 5′OH-guide RNA (gRNA)-mediated plasmid cleavage activity is unveiled. Conclusively, MhAgo is versatile, and its biochemical characteristics improve our understanding of pAgos and the pAgo-based techniques.

Posttranscriptional RNA modifications by adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing are abundant in the brain, yet elucidating functional sites remains challenging. To bridge this gap, we investigate spatiotemporal and genetically regulated A-to-I editing sites across prenatal and postnatal stages of human brain development. More than 10,000 spatiotemporally regulated A-to-I sites were identified that occur predominately in 3′ UTRs and introns, as well as 37 sites that recode amino acids in protein coding regions with precise changes in editing levels across development. Hyper-edited transcripts are also enriched in the aging brain and stabilize RNA secondary structures. These features are conserved in murine and non-human primate models of neurodevelopment. Finally, thousands of cis-editing quantitative trait loci (edQTLs) were identified with unique regulatory effects during prenatal and postnatal development. Collectively, this work offers a resolved atlas linking spatiotemporal variation in editing levels to genetic regulatory effects throughout distinct stages of brain maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Using random germline mutagenesis in mice, we identified a viable hypomorphic allele (boh) of the transcription-factor-encoding gene Ovol2 that resulted in obesity, which initially developed with normal food intake and physical activity but decreased energy expenditure. Fat weight was dramatically increased, while lean weight was reduced in 12-week-old boh homozygous mice, culminating by 24 weeks in massive obesity, hepatosteatosis, insulin resistance, and diabetes. The Ovol2boh/boh genotype augmented obesity in Lepob/ob mice, and pair-feeding failed to normalize obesity in Ovol2boh/boh mice. OVOL2-deficient mice were extremely cold intolerant. OVOL2 is essential for brown/beige adipose tissue-mediated thermogenesis. In white adipose tissues, OVOL2 limited adipogenesis by blocking C/EBPα engagement of its transcriptional targets. Overexpression of OVOL2 in adipocytes of mice fed with a high-fat diet reduced total body and liver fat and improved insulin sensitivity. Our data reveal that OVOL2 plays dual functions in thermogenesis and adipogenesis to maintain energy balance.
