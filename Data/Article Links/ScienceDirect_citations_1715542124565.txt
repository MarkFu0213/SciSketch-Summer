Abstract: Pervasive transcription of the mammalian genome generates numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are of crucial importance in diverse biological processes. Recent advances in high throughput sequencing technology have helped to accelerate the pace of lncRNA discovery. However, no study on the overall expression patterns of lncRNAs during muscle development has been conducted. We reported here the first analysis of lncRNA landscape in bovine embryonic, neonatal and adult skeletal muscle using Ribo-Zero RNA-Seq, a technology which can capture both poly(A)+ and poly(A)− transcripts. We finally defined 7692 high-confidence lncRNAs and uncovered 401 lncRNAs differentially expressed among three developmental stages, including lncMD, a novel muscle-specific lncRNA which is gradually up-regulated during myoblast differentiation. lncMD overexpression upregulated, whereas lncMD silencing decreased the expression of two well-established myogenic markers, myosin heavy chain (MHC) and myogenin (MyoG). In-depth analyses showed that lncMD acts as a molecular sponge for miR-125b and that insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is a direct target of miR-125b in cattle. Moreover, lncMD level was positively correlated with IGF2 mRNA level in bovine muscle tissues, a vital corollary to ceRNA function. Altogether, our research showed that lncMD acts as a ceRNA to sequester miR-125b, leading to heightened IGF2 expression and thus promotes muscle differentiation. Our findings also complement the reference genome annotation of cattle, which will likely be useful for further functional lncRNA cloning and more comprehensive studies on lncRNA regulation in muscle development.

Abstract: Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the degenerated intervertebral disc (IVD) has shown promise for decelerating or arresting IVD degeneration. Cellular mechanical properties play crucial roles in regulating cell-matrix interactions, potentially reflecting specific changes that occur based on cellular phenotype and behavior. However, the effect of co-culturing of MSCs with nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) on the mechanical properties of NPCs remains unknown. In our study, we demonstrated that co-culture of degenerated NPCs with MSCs resulted in significantly decreased mechanical moduli (elastic modulus, relaxed modulus, and instantaneous modulus) and increased biological activity (proliferation and expression of matrix genes) in degenerated NPCs, but not normal NPCs. SDF-1, CXCR4 ligand, was highly expressed in MSCs when co-cultured with degenerated NPCs. Inhibition of SDF-1 using CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 or knocking-down CXCR4 in degenerated NPCs abolished the MSCs-induced decrease in the mechanical moduli and increased biological activity of degenerated NPCs, suggesting a crucial role for SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling. AKT and FAK inhibition attenuated the MSCs- or SDF-1-induced decrease in the mechanical moduli of degenerated NPCs. In conclusion, it was demonstrated in vitro that MSCs regulate the mechanical properties of degenerated NPCs through SDF-1/CXCR4/AKT signaling. These findings highlight a possible mechanical mechanism for MSCs-induced modulation with degenerated NPCs, which may be applicable to MSCs-based therapy for disc degeneration.

Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein is bound and internalized by host cells and colocalizes with LPS in the cytoplasm: Implications for a role of LBP in intracellular LPS-signaling,

Abstract: The lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) is critically involved in innate immune responses to Gram-negative infections. We show here that human peripheral blood-derived monocytes, but not lymphocytes, stain positive for endogenous LBP on the cell surface. Studies on human macrophages demonstrate LBP binding at normal serum concentrations of 1–10μg/ml. Binding was increased in a concentration-dependent manner by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Fluorescence quenching experiments and confocal microscopy revealed constitutive and LPS-induced internalization of LBP by macrophages. Experiments with macrophages and HEK293 cell lines showed that binding and uptake of LBP do not depend on the LPS receptors CD14 and TLR4/MD-2. Fractionation of Triton X-100 solubilized cytoplasmic membranes revealed that LBP was primarily localized in non-raft domains under resting conditions. Cellular LPS stimulation elevated LBP levels and induced enrichment in fractions marking the transition between non-raft and raft domains. LBP was found to colocalize with LPS at the cytoplasmic membrane and in intracellular compartments of macrophages. In macrophages stimulated with LPS and ATP for inflammasome activation, LBP was observed in close vicinity to activated caspases. Furthermore, LBP conferred IL-1β production by LPS in the absence of ATP. These data establish that LBP serves not only as an extracellular LPS shuttle but in addition facilitates intracellular transport of LPS. This observation adds a new function to this central immune regulator of LPS biology and raises the possibility for a role of LBP in the delivery of LPS to TLR4-independent intracellular receptors.

Abstract: Interleukin-17A, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, has a direct proapoptotic effect on cardiomyocytes. However, the specific mechanism has not been clarified. In the present study, an in-vitro model of cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by IL-17A stimulation was employed and the roles of iNOS and Stat3 involved were investigated. Our data showed that the neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes express IL-17 receptors: IL-17RA and IL-17RC, but did not express IL-17A. Exogenous IL-17A significantly induces iNOS expression and hence the cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Moreover, IL-17A-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis can be achieved directly via iNOS activation. We further showed that exogenous IL-17A simultaneously triggers Stat3 activation, which in turn inhibits IL-17A-induced iNOS expression in cardiomyocytes. And both ChIP and dual-luciferase results confirmed that Stat3 directly inhibits transcriptional activities of iNOS via binding to its specific promoter region. Consistent with these data, silencing of Stat3 in fact can aggravate IL-17A-triggered cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Finally, using an in vivo myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury model, we verified that Stat3 inhibition increased iNOS expression and exacerbated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Thus, our data strongly support the notion that Stat3 plays a compensatory anti-apoptotic role in IL-17A/iNOS-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis via inhibiting iNOS transcription, providing a novel molecular mechanism of apoptosis regulation and complicated interactions between IL-17A/iNOS and IL-17A/Stat3 signalings.

Abstract: Together with its endogenous ligands (dynorphin), the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) plays an important role in modulating various physiological and pharmacological responses, with a classical G protein–coupled pathway mediating analgesia and non-G protein–dependent pathway, especially the β-arrestin–dependent pathway, eliciting side effects of dysphoria, aversion, drug-seeking in addicts, or even relapse to addiction. Although mounting evidence has verified a functional overlap between dynorphin/KOR and neurotensin/neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) systems, little is known about direct interaction between the two receptors. Here, we showed that KOR and NTSR1 form a heterodimer that functions as a novel pharmacological entity, and this heterodimer, in turn, brings about a switch in KOR-mediated signal transduction, from G protein–dependent to β-arrestin-2–dependent. This was simultaneously verified by analyzing a KOR mutant (196th residue) that lost the ability to dimerize with NTSR1. We also found that dual occupancy of the heterodimer forced the β-arrestin-2–dependent pathway back into Gi protein–dependent signaling, according to KOR activation. These data provide new insights into the interaction between KOR and NTSR1, and the newly discovered role of NTSR1 acting as a switch between G protein– and β-arrestin–dependent pathways of KOR also suggests a new approach for utilizing pathologically elevated dynorphin/KOR system into full play for its analgesic effect with limited side effects.

Abstract: Mitochondria play a pivotal role in apoptosis: permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the release of pro-apoptotic proteins from the intermembrane space of mitochondria are regarded as the key event in apoptosis induction. Here we demonstrate how non-toxic doses of the mitochondrial Complex II inhibitor thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), which specifically inhibits the ubiquinone-binding site of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), synergistically stimulated cell death, induced by harmless doses of cisplatin in a panel of chemoresistant neuroblastoma cell lines. Apoptotic cell death was confirmed by cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase, processing of caspase-3, which is an important executive enzyme in apoptosis, and caspase-3-like activity. Methyl malonate, an inhibitor of the SDHA subunit partially reversed apoptosis stimulated by TTFA in SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma cells (NB), indicating that sensitization requires oxidation of succinate. In contrast, in IMR-32 NB cells, the same concentrations of TTFA markedly suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Comparison of oxygen consumption in cisplatin-resistant SK-N-BE(2) and cisplatin-sensitive IMR-32 cells clearly demonstrated impaired Complex II activity in IMR-32 cells. We also found that in SK-N-BE(2) cells co-treatment with cisplatin and TTFA markedly stimulated formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas in IMR cells, cisplatin-mediated ROS production was attenuated by TTFA, which explains apoptosis suppression in these cells. Thus, functionally active SDH is a prerequisite for the ROS-mediated sensitization to treatment by TTFA.

Abstract: NBS1 is an early component in DNA-Damage Response (DDR) that participates in the initiation of the responses aiming to repair double-strand breaks caused by different mechanisms. Early steps in DDR have to react to local alterations in chromatin that are induced by DNA damage. NBS1 participates in the early detection of DNA damage and functions as a platform for the recruitment and assembly of components that are sequentially required for the repair process. In this work we have studied whether the VRK1 chromatin kinase can affect the activation of NBS1 in response to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation. VRK1 is forming a basal preassembled complex with NBS1 in non-damaged cells. Knockdown of VRK1 resulted in the loss of NBS1 foci induced by ionizing radiation, an effect that was also detected in cell-cycle arrested cells and in ATM (−/−) cells. The phosphorylation of NBS1 in Ser343 by VRK1 is induced by either doxorubicin or IR in ATM (−/−) cells. Phosphorylated NBS1 is also complexed with VRK1. NBS1 phosphorylation by VRK1 cooperates with ATM. This phosphorylation of NBS1 by VRK1 contributes to the stability of NBS1 in ATM (−/−) cells, and the consequence of its loss can be prevented by treatment with the MG132 proteasome inhibitor of RNF8. We conclude that VRK1 regulation of NBS1 contributes to the stability of the repair complex and permits the sequential steps in DDR.

Abstract: Microtubule nucleation from γ-tubulin complexes, located at the centrosome, is an essential step in the formation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. However, the signaling mechanisms that regulate microtubule nucleation in interphase cells are largely unknown. In this study, we report that γ-tubulin is in complexes containing G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1), p21-activated kinase interacting exchange factor (βPIX), and p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) in various cell lines. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed association of GIT1, βPIX and activated PAK1 with centrosomes. Microtubule regrowth experiments showed that depletion of βPIX stimulated microtubule nucleation, while depletion of GIT1 or PAK1 resulted in decreased nucleation in the interphase cells. These data were confirmed for GIT1 and βPIX by phenotypic rescue experiments, and counting of new microtubules emanating from centrosomes during the microtubule regrowth. The importance of PAK1 for microtubule nucleation was corroborated by the inhibition of its kinase activity with IPA-3 inhibitor. GIT1 with PAK1 thus represent positive regulators, and βPIX is a negative regulator of microtubule nucleation from the interphase centrosomes. The regulatory roles of GIT1, βPIX and PAK1 in microtubule nucleation correlated with recruitment of γ-tubulin to the centrosome. Furthermore, in vitro kinase assays showed that GIT1 and βPIX, but not γ-tubulin, serve as substrates for PAK1. Finally, direct interaction of γ-tubulin with the C-terminal domain of βPIX and the N-terminal domain of GIT1, which targets this protein to the centrosome, was determined by pull-down experiments. We propose that GIT1/βPIX signaling proteins with PAK1 kinase represent a novel regulatory mechanism of microtubule nucleation in interphase cells.

Abstract: Class III β-tubulin (TUBB3) is a marker of drug resistance expressed in a variety of solid tumors. Originally, it was described as an important element of chemoresistance to taxanes. Recent studies have revealed that TUBB3 is also involved in an adaptive response to a microenvironmental stressor, e.g. low oxygen levels and poor nutrient supply in some solid tumors, independently of the microtubule targeting agent. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that TUBB3 is a marker of biological aggressiveness associated with modulation of metastatic abilities in colon cancer. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a basic cellular process by which epithelial cells lose their epithelial behavior and become invasive cells involved in cancer metastasis. Snail is a zinc-finger transcription factor which is able to induce EMT through the repression of E-cadherin expression. In the presented studies we focused on the analysis of the TUBB3 role in EMT-induced colon adenocarcinoma cell lines HT-29 and LS180. We observed a positive correlation between Snail presence and TUBB3 upregulation in tested adenocarcinoma cell lines. The cellular and behavioral analysis revealed for the first time that elevated TUBB3 level is functionally linked to increased cell migration and invasive capability of EMT induced cells. Additionally, the post-transcriptional modifications (phosphorylation, glycosylation) appear to regulate the cellular localization of TUBB3 and its phosphorylation, observed in cytoskeleton, is probably involved in cell motility modulation.

Abstract: QUIN is a glutamate agonist playing a role in the misregulation of the cytoskeleton, which is associated with neurodegeneration in rats. In this study, we focused on microglial activation, FGF2/Erk signaling, gap junctions (GJs), inflammatory parameters and redox imbalance acting on cytoskeletal dynamics of the in QUIN-treated neural cells of rat striatum. FGF-2/Erk signaling was not altered in QUIN-treated primary astrocytes or neurons, however cytoskeleton was disrupted. In co-cultured astrocytes and neurons, QUIN-activated FGF2/Erk signaling prevented the cytoskeleton from remodeling. In mixed cultures (astrocyte, neuron, microglia), QUIN-induced FGF-2 increased level failed to activate Erk and promoted cytoskeletal destabilization. The effects of QUIN in mixed cultures involved redox imbalance upstream of Erk activation. Decreased connexin 43 (Cx43) immunocontent and functional GJs, was also coincident with disruption of the cytoskeleton in primary astrocytes and mixed cultures. We postulate that in interacting astrocytes and neurons the cytoskeleton is preserved against the insult of QUIN by activation of FGF-2/Erk signaling and proper cell-cell interaction through GJs. In mixed cultures, the FGF-2/Erk signaling is blocked by the redox imbalance associated with microglial activation and disturbed cell communication, disrupting the cytoskeleton. Thus, QUIN signal activates differential mechanisms that could stabilize or destabilize the cytoskeleton of striatal astrocytes and neurons in culture, and glial cells play a pivotal role in these responses preserving or disrupting a combination of signaling pathways and cell-cell interactions. Taken together, our findings shed light into the complex role of the active interaction of astrocytes, neurons and microglia in the neurotoxicity of QUIN.

Abstract: Peroxisomes contain numerous enzymatic activities that are important for mammalian physiology. Patients lacking either all peroxisomal functions or a single enzyme or transporter function typically develop severe neurological deficits, which originate from aberrant development of the brain, demyelination and loss of axonal integrity, neuroinflammation or other neurodegenerative processes. Whilst correlating peroxisomal properties with a compilation of pathologies observed in human patients and mouse models lacking all or individual peroxisomal functions, we discuss the importance of peroxisomal metabolites and tissue- and cell type-specific contributions to the observed brain pathologies. This enables us to deconstruct the local and systemic contribution of individual metabolic pathways to specific brain functions. We also review the recently discovered variability of pathological symptoms in cases with unexpectedly mild presentation of peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Finally, we explore the emerging evidence linking peroxisomes to more common neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, autism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Abstract: The Na+/H+-exchanger NHE1 and the monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 are crucial for intracellular pH regulation, particularly under active metabolism. NHE1, a reversible antiporter, uses the energy provided by the Na+ gradient to expel H+ ions generated in the cytosol. The reversible H+/lactate− symporters MCT1 and 4 cotransport lactate and proton, leading to the net extrusion of lactic acid in glycolytic tumors. In the first two sections of this article we review important features and remaining questions on the structure, biochemical function and cellular roles of these transporters. We then use a fully-coupled mathematical model to simulate their relative contribution to pH regulation in response to lactate production, as it occurs in highly hypoxic and glycolytic tumor cells. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mitochondrial Channels edited by Pierre Sonveaux, Pierre Maechler and Jean-Claude Martinou.

Abstract: The cap ‘n’ collar (CNC) family of transcription factors play important roles in resistance of oxidative and electrophilic stresses. Among the CNC family members, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is critical for regulating the antioxidant and phase II enzymes through antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated transactivation. The activity of Nrf2 is controlled by a variety of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation and sumoylation. Here we demonstrate that the arginine methyltransferase-1 (PRMT1) methylates Nrf2 protein at a single residue of arginine 437, both in vitro and in vivo. Using the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) as a model of phase II enzyme gene, we found that methylation of Nrf2 by PRMT1 led to a moderate increase of its DNA-binding activity and transactivation, which subsequently protected cells against the tBHP-induced glutathione depletion and cell death. Collectively, our results define a novel modification of Nrf2, which operates as a fine-tuning mechanism for the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 under the oxidative stress.

Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that induces severe lung infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and acute lung injury. Under these conditions, the bacterium diminishes epithelial integrity and inhibits tissue repair mechanisms, leading to persistent infections. Understanding the involved bacterial virulence factors and their mode of action is essential for the development of new therapeutic approaches. In our study we discovered a so far unknown effect of the P. aeruginosa lectin LecB on host cell physiology. LecB alone was sufficient to attenuate migration and proliferation of human lung epithelial cells and to induce transcriptional activity of NF-κB. These effects are characteristic of impaired tissue repair. Moreover, we found a strong degradation of β-catenin, which was partially recovered by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. In addition, LecB induced loss of cell–cell contacts and reduced expression of the β-catenin targets c-myc and cyclin D1. Blocking of LecB binding to host cell plasma membrane receptors by soluble l-fucose prevented these changes in host cell behavior and signaling, and thereby provides a powerful strategy to suppress LecB function. Our findings suggest that P. aeruginosa employs LecB as a virulence factor to induce β-catenin degradation, which then represses processes that are directly linked to tissue recovery.

Abstract: The Yersinia outer protein J (YopJ) plays a pivotal role in evading the host immune response and establishes a persistent infection in host cells after bacterial infection. YopJ is a cysteine protease and can act as a deubiquitinating enzyme that deubiquitinates several targets in multiple signaling pathways. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a critical adapter for the induction of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and subsequent production of the cytokines in response to nucleic acids in the cytoplasm. Our studies demonstrate that YopJ targets STING to inhibit IRF3 signaling. Specially, YopJ interacts with STING to block its ER-to-Golgi traffic and remove its K63-linked ubiquitination chains. Deubiquited STING perturbs the formation of STING-TBK1 complex and the activation of IRF3. The 172th cysteine of YopJ mediated STING deubiquitination and IRF3 signaling inhibition. Consequently, mice infected with WT and ΔYopJ/YopJ bacteria induced lower levels of IRF3 and IFN-β, decreased inflammation and reduced staining of STING as compared to ΔYopJ and ΔYopJ/YopJ C172A strains infection. The data herein reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which YopJ modulates innate immune signaling.

Abstract: Low expression levels of Nogo-B (a.k.a Reticulon-4B) are associated with excessive vascular remodeling (VR). VR implies changes in the cytoskeleton (CSK) of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We studied the connection between Nogo-B expression levels and the organization/dynamics of microtubules (MTs) and Actin CSK in VSMCs. Nogo-B was found at the endoplasmic reticulum and focal contacts and co-localized with F-Actin and α-Tubulin on resting and migrating VSMCs. Down-regulation of Nogo-B using siRNAs resulted in a significant reduction of Rho A activity as well as F-Actin filaments. Concomitantly, we found more acetylated MTs (increased α-Tubulin acetylation on Lys 40 residues) and less histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and lower HDAC-6 (the main α-Tubulin de-acetylase) expression levels in Nogo-B depleted cells. Moreover, Nogo-B-depleted cells had larger total cell area and spread faster than control cells. Paradoxically, Nogo-B depleted VSMCs exhibited greater 2D chemotactic response while migrate less on 3D collagen matrix. Additionally, we observed an increase in the generation of bi and multinucleated cells upon Nogo-B silencing. In conclusion, we showed that Nogo-B influences key functions in VSMCs by modulating MTs and Actin organization/dynamics via Rho A activation and HDAC-6 expression and activity.

Abstract: The mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier imports ADP from the cytosol and exports ATP from the mitochondrial matrix, which are key transport steps for oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotic organisms. The transport protein belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family, a large transporter family in the inner membrane of mitochondria. It is one of the best studied members of the family and serves as a paradigm for the molecular mechanism of mitochondrial carriers. Structurally, the carrier consists of three homologous domains, each composed of two transmembrane α-helices linked with a loop and short α-helix on the matrix side. The transporter cycles between a cytoplasmic and matrix state in which a central substrate binding site is alternately accessible to these compartments for binding of ADP or ATP. On both the cytoplasmic and matrix side of the carrier are networks consisting of three salt bridges each. In the cytoplasmic state, the matrix salt bridge network is formed and the cytoplasmic network is disrupted, opening the central substrate binding site to the intermembrane space and cytosol, whereas the converse occurs in the matrix state. In the transport cycle, tighter substrate binding in the intermediate states allows the interconversion of conformations by lowering the energy barrier for disruption and formation of these networks, opening and closing the carrier to either side of the membrane in an alternating way. Conversion between cytoplasmic and matrix states might require the simultaneous rotation of three domains around a central translocation pathway, constituting a unique mechanism among transport proteins.

Abstract: Vanilloids including capsaicin and resiniferatoxin are potent transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) agonists. TRPV1 overstimulation selectively ablates capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons in animal models in vivo. The cytotoxic mechanisms are based on strong Na+ and Ca2+ influx via TRPV1 channels, which leads to mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and necrotic cell swelling. Increased TRPV1 expression levels are also observed in breast and prostate cancer and derived cell lines. Here, we examined whether potent agonist-induced overstimulation mediated by TRPV1 might represent a means for the eradication of prostate carcinoma (PC-3, Du 145, LNCaP) and breast cancer (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, BT-474) cells in vitro. While rat sensory neurons were highly vanilloid-sensitive, normal rat prostate epithelial cells were resistant in vivo. We found TRPV1 to be expressed in all cancer cell lines at mRNA and protein levels, yet protein expression levels were significantly lower compared to sensory neurons. Treatment of all human carcinoma cell lines with capsaicin didn't lead to overstimulation cytotoxicity in vitro. We assume that the low vanilloid-sensitivity of prostate and breast cancer cells is associated with low expression levels of TRPV1, since ectopic TRPV1 expression rendered them susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of vanilloids evidenced by plateau-type Ca2+ signals, mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and Na+- and Ca2+-dependent membrane disorganization. Moreover, long-term monitoring revealed that merely the ectopic expression of TRPV1 stopped cell proliferation and often induced apoptotic processes via strong activation of caspase-3 activity. Our results indicate that specific targeting of TRPV1 function remains a putative strategy for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is among the main pathologies leading to blindness in adults and has currently no cure or effective treatment. Selective apoptosis of retina pigment epithelial (RPE) cells results in the progressive loss of photoreceptor neurons, with the consequent gradual vision loss. Oxidative stress plays an important role in this process. We have previously determined that activation of RXRs protects rat photoreceptor neurons from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. In this study we investigated whether RXR ligands prevented apoptosis in an RPE cell line, D407 cells, exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 induced apoptosis of D407 cells, promoting p65NFκB nuclear translocation, increasing Bax mRNA expression, activating caspase-3 and altering cell morphology. We show, for the first time, that HX630, a RXR pan-agonist, protected D407 cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis, preventing p65NFκB nuclear translocation, increasing Bclxl and PPARγ mRNA levels and simultaneously decreasing Bax mRNA levels and caspase-3 activation. Pretreatment with a RXR antagonist blocked HX630 protection. LG100754, which binds RXRs but only activates heterodimers and is an antagonist of RXR homodimers, also had a protective effect. In addition, only agonists known to bind to RXR/PPARγ were protective. As a whole, our results suggest that RXR activation protects RPE cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and this protection might involve signaling through a heterodimeric receptor, such as RXR/PPARγ. These data also imply that RXR agonists might provide potential pharmacological tools for treating retina degenerative diseases.

Abstract: Sensory neuron subpopulations as well as breast and prostate cancer cells express functional transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) ion channels; however little is known how TRPV1 activation leads to biological responses. Agonist-induced activation of TRPV1 resulted in specific spatiotemporal patterns of cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals in breast and prostate cancer-derived cells. Capsaicin (CAPS; 50μM) evoked intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and/or intercellular Ca2+ waves in all cell lines. As evidenced in prostate cancer Du 145 cells, oscillations were largely dependent on the expression of functional TRPV1 channels in the plasma membrane, phospholipase C activation and on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ ions. Concomitant oscillations of the mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ concentration resulted in mitochondria energization evidenced by increased ATP production. CAPS-induced Ca2+ oscillations also occurred in a subset of sensory neurons, yet already at lower CAPS concentrations (1μM). Stimulation of ectopically expressed TRPV1 channels in CAPS-insensitive NIH-3T3 cells didn't provoke CAPS-triggered Ca2+ oscillations; rather it resulted in low-magnitude, long-lasting elevations of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. This indicates that sole TRPV1 activation is not sufficient to generate Ca2+ oscillations. Instead the initial TRPV1-mediated signal leads to the activation of the inositol phospholipid pathway. This in turn suffices to generate a biologically relevant frequency-modulated Ca2+ signal.

Abstract: PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene characterized as a phosphatase that antagonizes the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway in the cytoplasm. Nuclear PTEN plays roles in chromosomal stability, in which the double-strand breaks (DSB) repair mediated by homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is critical. Herein, the role of nuclear PTEN in DSB repair and the underlying molecular mechanism was investigated in this study. Using human breast cancer BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, we reveal a specific feature of PTEN that controls poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Ku70 and interferes with binding of Ku70 at DSB. Plasmid-based end joining and reporter assays showed that nuclear PTEN restrained NHEJ efficacy. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that nuclear PTEN impaired Ku70 complex binding to DSB by 3-fold. Co-immunoprecipitation assay showed PTEN regulated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Ku70 instead of directly interacting with Ku70, while PTEN promoted the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP1 and induced the degradation of PARP1 in PTEN-WT cells exposed to DSB agents. Of note, the role of PTEN in DSB repair mostly depends on its nuclear localization rather than its phosphatase activity. As a result, the absence of nuclear PTEN rather than phosphatase-negative PTEN confers cell hypersensitivity to anti-tumor DNA damage drugs. This finding contributes to understanding the effect of PTEN in repair of DSB and using defined anti-tumor DSB drugs to treat tumor cells with aberrant PTEN.

Abstract: ATG9A is a multispanning membrane protein required for autophagosome formation. Under basal conditions, neosynthesized ATG9A proteins travel to the Golgi apparatus and cycle between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. In the present work, we searched for molecular determinants involved in the subcellular trafficking of human ATG9A in HeLa cells using sequential deletions and point mutations. Deletion of amino acids L340 to L354 resulted in the retention of ATG9A in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, we found that substitution of the L711YM713 sequence (located in the C-terminal region of ATG9A) by alanine residues severely impaired its transport through the Golgi apparatus. This defect could be corrected by oligomerization of the mutant protein with co-transfected wild-type ATG9A, suggesting that ATG9A oligomerization may help its sorting through biosynthetic compartments. Lastly, the study of the consequences of the LYM/AAA mutation on the intracellular trafficking of ATG9A highlighted that some newly synthesized ATG9A can bypass the Golgi apparatus to reach the plasma membrane. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into the intracellular pathways followed by ATG9A to reach different subcellular compartments, and into the intramolecular determinants that drive the sorting of this protein.

Abstract: The effects of autophagy on cell death are highly contextual and either beneficial or deleterious. One prime example for this dual function of autophagy is evidenced by the cell responses to the BH3 mimetic AT-101 that is known to induce either apoptotic or autophagy-dependent cell death in different settings. Based on previous reports, we hypothesized that the expression levels of pro-survival Bcl-2 family members may be key determinants for the respective death mode induced by AT-101. Here we investigated the role of autophagy in the response of MCF7 breast cancer cells to AT-101. AT-101 treatment induced a prominent conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and apoptotic cell death characterized by the appearance of Annexin-positive/PI-negative early apoptotic cells and PARP cleavage. Inhibition of the autophagy pathway, either through application of 3-MA or by lentiviral knockdown of ATG5, strongly potentiated cell death, indicating a pro-survival function of autophagy. Overexpression of wild type Bcl-xL significantly diminished the net amount of AT-101-induced cell death, but failed to alter the death-enhancing effects of the ATG5 knockdown. This was also observed with the organelle-specific variants Bcl-xL-ActA and Bcl-2-ActA (mitochondrial) as well as Bcl-xL-cb5 and Bcl-2-cb5 (ER) which all reduced AT-101-induced cell death, but did not affect the death-enhancing effects of 3-MA. Collectively, our data indicate that in apoptosis-proficient MCF7 cells, AT-101 triggers Bcl-2- and Bcl-xL-dependent apoptosis and a cytoprotective autophagy response that is independent of the expression and subcellular localization of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2.

Abstract: The release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequent replenishment of ER Ca2+ by Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCE) play critical roles in the regulation of liver metabolism by adrenaline, glucagon and other hormones. Both ER Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry are severely inhibited in steatotic hepatocytes. Exendin-4, a slowly-metabolised glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, is known to reduce liver glucose output and liver lipid, but the mechanisms involved are not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether exendin-4 alters intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in steatotic hepatocytes, and to evaluate the mechanisms involved. Exendin-4 completely reversed lipid-induced inhibition of SOCE in steatotic liver cells, but did not reverse lipid-induced inhibition of ER Ca2+ release. The action of exendin-4 on Ca2+ entry was rapid in onset and was mimicked by GLP-1 or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. In steatotic liver cells, exendin-4 caused a rapid decrease in lipid (half time 6.5min), inhibited the accumulation of lipid in liver cells incubated in the presence of palmitate plus the SOCE inhibitor BTP-2, and enhanced the formation of cyclic AMP. Hormone-stimulated accumulation of extracellular glucose in glycogen replete steatotic liver cells was inhibited compared to that in non-steatotic cells, and this effect of lipid was reversed by exendin-4. It is concluded that, in steatotic hepatocytes, exendin-4 reverses the lipid-induced inhibition of SOCE leading to restoration of hormone-regulated cytoplasmic Ca2+ signalling. The mechanism may involve GLP-1 receptors, cyclic AMP, lipolysis, decreased diacylglycerol and decreased activity of protein kinase C.

Abstract: Podocyte injury or loss plays a major role in the pathogenesis of proteinuric kidney disease including diabetic nephropathy (DN). High basal level of autophagy is critical for podocyte health. Recent studies have revealed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) can ameliorate podocyte injury and proteinuria. However, little is known about the impact of HGF on podocyte autophagy. In this study, we investigated whether and how HGF affects autophagy in podocytes treated with high glucose (HG) conditions. HGF significantly diminishes apoptosis, oxidative stress and autophagy impairment inflicted by HG in podocytes. These beneficial effects of HGF disappear once HGF receptor is blocked by SU11274, a specific inhibitor of c-Met. Moreover, HGF markedly suppresses HG-stimulated glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3β) activity. Accordingly, exogenous constitutively-active GSK3β overexpression using an adenoviral vector system (Ad-GSK3β-S9A) abrogates the ability of HGF to ameliorate HG-mediated podocyte injury while neither adenoviral-mediated overexpression of wild-type GSK3β (Ad-GSK3β-WT) nor adenoviral transduction of inactive GSK3β mutant (Ad-GSK3β-K85A) can counteract the protective effects of HGF on HG-treated podocytes. Collectively, these results suggest that HGF prevents HG-induced podocyte injury via an autophagy-promoting mechanism, which involves GSK3β inhibition.

Abstract: Mechanical forces are instrumental to cardiovascular development and physiology. The heart beats approximately 2.6 billion times in a human lifetime and heart valves ensure that these contractions result in an efficient, unidirectional flow of the blood. Composed of endocardial cells (EdCs) and extracellular matrix (ECM), cardiac valves are among the most mechanically challenged structures of the body both during and after their development. Understanding how hemodynamic forces modulate cardiovascular function and morphogenesis is key to unraveling the relationship between normal and pathological cardiovascular development and physiology. Most valve diseases have their origins in embryogenesis, either as signs of abnormal developmental processes or the aberrant re-expression of fetal gene programs normally quiescent in adulthood. Here we review recent discoveries in the mechanobiology of cardiac valve development and introduce the latest technologies being developed in the zebrafish, including live cell imaging and optical technologies, as well as modeling approaches that are currently transforming this field.

Abstract: Restriction of tissue factor (TF) activity at the cell surface and TF release are critical for prevention of excessive coagulation. This study examined the regulation of TF dephosphorylation and its release through ubiquitination. A plasmid containing the sequence to express the tandem protein TF-tGFP was mutated to include an arginine-substitution at Lys255 within TF. MDA-MB-231 cell line, and HCAEC endothelial cells were transfected and subsequently activated with PAR2-agonist peptide. The wild-type and mutant TF-tGFP were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and the ubiquitination and phosphorylation state of TF examined. Analysis of the proteins showed that arginine-substitution of Lys255 within TF prevented its ubiquitination while the wild-type TF-tGFP was oligoubiquitinated. The TF-associated oligoubiquitin chain was estimated to contain up to 4 ubiquitin units, with the linkage formed between Lys63 of one ubiquitin unit, and the C-terminus of the next unit. The Lys255→Arg substitution of TF-tGFP prolonged the phosphorylation of Ser253 within TF, compared to the wild-type TF-tGFP, lengthened the presence of TF-tGFP at the cell surface and extended the duration of TF-tGFP release from cells following PAR2 activation. A biotinylated 19-mer peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of TF (TFc) was used as substrate to show that the ubiquitination of TF was mediated by the Ube2D family of E2-enzymes and involved Mdm2. Moreover, double-phosphorylation of TFc was prerequisite for ubiquitination, with subsequent dephosphorylation of Ser253 by phosphatase PP2A. In conclusion, oligoubiquitination of Lys255 within TF permits PP2A to bind and dephosphorylate Ser253 and occurs to terminate TF release and contain its activity.

Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) for which there is no overall effective treatment. Recent work indicates tissue transglutaminase (TG2) plays a pivotal intracellular role in proteostasis in CF epithelia and that the pan TG inhibitor cysteamine improves CFTR stability. Here we show TG2 has another role in CF pathology linked with TGFβ1 activation and signalling, induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), CFTR stability and induction of matrix deposition. We show that increased TG2 expression in normal and CF bronchial epithelial cells increases TGFβ1 levels, promoting EMT progression, and impairs tight junctions as measured by Transepithelial Electric Resistance (TEER) which can be reversed by selective inhibition of TG2 with an observed increase in CFTR stability. Our data indicate that selective inhibition of TG2 provides a potential therapeutic avenue for reducing fibrosis and increasing CFTR stability in CF.

Abstract: The canonical model of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation assumes that ligand-induced dimerization of inactive receptor monomers is a prerequisite for autophosphorylation. For several RTK families, recent results of fluorescence microscopy provided evidence for preformed receptor dimers that may or may not require ligand binding for kinase activity. Here we report, for the first time, the application of advanced quantitative fluorescence microscopy techniques to study changes in the oligomerization state of the RTK Met in response to stimulation by its endogenous ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We used inducible C-terminal fusions between Met and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or red fluorescent protein (RFP) in combination with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). A small fraction of HGF-independent Met dimers appeared to be present in cells even at low receptor density. At high receptor density, both the fraction of Met dimers and the level of Met autophosphorylation increased in the absence of HGF. Stimulation with HGF at low receptor density significantly increased the fraction of Met dimers on live cells. We found no indications of Met oligomers larger than dimers. Our findings thus confirm a model of Met activation through HGF-induced dimerization and at the same time they support previous reports of Met dimers in unstimulated cells. The tools established in this work will be useful to further characterize the mechanism of Met activation and to define the contribution of co-receptors.

Abstract: This study explores the V600BRAF-MITF-PGC-1α axis and compares metabolic and functional changes occurring in primary and metastatic V600BRAF melanoma cell lines. V600BRAF mutations in homo/heterozygosis were found to be correlated to high levels of pERK, to downregulate PGC-1α/β, MITF and tyrosinase activity, resulting in a reduced melanin synthesis as compared to BRAFwt melanoma cells. In this scenario, V600BRAF switches on a metabolic reprogramming in melanoma, leading to a decreased OXPHOS activity and increased glycolytic ATP, lactate, HIF-1α and MCT4 levels. Furthermore, the induction of autophagy and the presence of ER stress markers in V600BRAF metastatic melanoma cells suggest that metabolic adaptations of these cells occur as compensatory survival mechanisms. For the first time, we underline the role of peIF2α as an important marker of metastatic behaviour in melanoma. Our results suggest the hypothesis that inhibition of the glycolytic pathway, inactivation of peIF2α and a reduction of basal autophagy could be suitable targets for novel combination therapies in a specific subgroup of metastatic melanoma.

Abstract: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies with variable patterns of behavior and responses to therapy. NHL development and invasion depend on multiple interactions between tumor cells and non-neoplastic cells. Such interactions are usually modulated by several cytokines. Accordingly, it was demonstrated that matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were activated in human lymphoid cell lines by interleukin-6 (IL-6). The activation of these enzymes is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis in human cancers. MMPs are also activated in several cancers by osteopontin (OPN), a secreted glycoprotein that regulates cell adhesion, migration, and survival. However, it is still unclear if MMPs play a role in NHL development and if their activation is determined by OPN and/or IL-6. In the present study, two groups of 78 NHL patients and 95 healthy donors were recruited for the analysis of OPN, MMP-2, MMP-9 and IL-6. Significant higher circulating levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, OPN and IL-6 were observed in NHL patients when compared to healthy donors. Similar data were obtained by analyzing the activity of both MMP-2 and MMP-9. The multivariate regression model indicates that, in both NHL cases and healthy donors, OPN is associated with the increase of MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels independently of IL-6. These data were first confirmed by “in silico” analyses and then by “in vitro” experiments conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells randomly selected from both NHL patients and healthy donors. Overall, our data suggest that the activation of MMPs in NHL development is mostly associated with OPN. However, IL-6 may play an important role in the lymphomagenesis through the activation of other molecular pathways.

Abstract: Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake regulates a wide array of cell functions, from stimulation of aerobic metabolism and ATP production in physiological settings, to induction of cell death in pathological conditions. The molecular identity of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU), the highly selective channel responsible for Ca2+ entry through the IMM, has been described less than five years ago. Since then, research has been conducted to clarify the modulation of its activity, which relies on the dynamic interaction with regulatory proteins, and its contribution to the pathophysiology of organs and tissues. Particular attention has been placed on characterizing the role of MCU in cardiac and skeletal muscles. In this review we summarize the molecular structure and regulation of the MCU complex in addition to its pathophysiological role, with particular attention to striated muscle tissues.

Abstract: Diapause (developmental arrest) is characterized by dramatic depression of metabolic activity and profoundly extends insect lifespan, similar to the Caenorhabditis elegans dauer stage and Drosophila longevity; however, the molecular mechanism of low metabolism in insect diapause is unclear. Here, we show that HIF-1α expression is significantly increased in diapause-destined pupal brains compared to nondiapause-destined pupal brains and that HIF-1α negatively regulates mitochondrial biogenesis. HIF-1α mediates this effect by inhibiting c-Myc activity via proteasome-dependent degradation of c-Myc. The mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which encodes a key factor involved in mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial DNA replication, is activated by the binding of c-Myc to the TFAM promoter, thereby inducing transcription. Loss of TFAM expression is a major factor contributing to reducing the mitochondrial activity. Thus, the HIF-1α-c-Myc-TFAM signaling pathway participates in the regulation of mitochondrial activity for insect diapause or lifespan extension.

Abstract: Exocytosis of the sperm's single secretory granule, or acrosome, is a regulated exocytosis triggered by components of the egg's investments. In addition to external calcium, sperm exocytosis (termed the acrosome reaction) requires cAMP synthesized endogenously and calcium mobilized from the acrosome through IP3-sensitive channels. The relevant cAMP target is Epac. In the first part of this paper, we present a novel tool (the TAT-cAMP sponge) to investigate cAMP-related signaling pathways in response to progesterone as acrosome reaction trigger. The TAT-cAMP sponge consists of the cAMP-binding sites of protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIβ fused to the protein transduction domain TAT of the human immunodeficiency virus-1. The sponge permeated into sperm, sequestered endogenous cAMP, and blocked exocytosis. Progesterone increased the population of sperm with Rap1-GTP, Rab3-GTP, and Rab27-GTP in the acrosomal region; pretreatment with the TAT-cAMP sponge prevented the activation of all three GTPases. In the second part of this manuscript, we show that phospholipase Cε (PLCε) is required for the acrosome reaction downstream of Rap1 and upstream of intra-acrosomal calcium mobilization. Last, we present direct evidence that cAMP, Epac, Rap1, and PLCε are necessary for calcium mobilization from sperm's secretory granule. In summary, we describe here a pathway that connects cAMP to calcium mobilization from the acrosome during sperm exocytosis. Never before had direct evidence for each step of the cascade been put together in the same study.

Abstract: Schwann cell migration is essential during the regenerative response to nerve injury, however, the factors that regulate this phenomenon are not yet clear. Here we describe that retinoic acid (RA), whose production and signaling activity are greatly enhanced during nerve regeneration, increases Schwann cell migration. This is accompanied by the up-regulation of NEDD9, a member of the CAS family of scaffold proteins previously implicated in migratory and invasive behavior in gliomas, melanomas and the neural crest cells from which Schwann cells derive. This RA-induced NEDD9 accumulation is due to augmented mRNA levels, as well as an increase of NEDD9 protein stability. Although all NEDD9 phospho-isoforms present in Schwann cells are induced by the retinoid, the hormone also changes its phosphorylation status, thus altering the ratio between the different isoforms. Silencing NEDD9 in Schwann cells had no effect on basal migratory ability, but completely abrogated RA-induced enhanced migration. Collectively, our results indicate that RA could be a major regulator of Schwann cell migration after nerve injury, thus offering a new insight into peripheral nerve repair.

Abstract: Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) eliminate pathogen-infected and cancerous cells mainly by polarized secretion of lytic granules (LG, containing cytotoxic molecules like perforin and granzymes) at the immunological synapse (IS). Members of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) family are involved in trafficking (generation, transport and fusion) of vesicles at the IS. Syntaxin 8 (Stx8) is expressed in LG and colocalizes with the T cell receptor (TCR) upon IS formation. Here, we report the significance of Stx8 for human CTL cytotoxicity. We found that Stx8 mostly localized in late, recycling endosomal and lysosomal compartments with little expression in early endosomal compartments. Down-regulation of Stx8 by siRNA resulted in reduced cytotoxicity. We found that following perforin release of the pre-existing pool upon target cell contact, Stx8 down-regulated CTL regenerate perforin pools less efficiently and thus release less perforin compared to control CTL. CD107a degranulation, real-time and end-point population cytotoxicity assays, and high resolution microscopy support our conclusion that Stx8 is required for proper and timely sorting and trafficking of cytotoxic molecules to functional LG through the endosomal pathway in human CTL.

Abstract: Regulated autophagy is a critical component for a healthy skeletal muscle mass, such that dysregulation of the autophagic processes correlates with severe myopathies. Thus, defining the biological molecules involved in the autophagic processes within skeletal muscle is of great importance. Here we demonstrate that globular adiponectin (gAd) activates autophagy in skeletal muscle myoblasts via an AMPK-dependent mechanism. Activation of autophagy through gAd promotes myoblast survival and apoptosis inhibition during serum starvation and the gAd-activated autophagy orchestrates the myogenic properties of the hormone. Consistent with this conclusion, inhibition of gAd-activated autophagy by both a pharmacological (chloroquine) or siRNA approach greatly inhibited muscle differentiation, as demonstrated by reductions in myosin heavy chain expression and myotube formation. Further support for the role of adiponectin in autophagy comes from the skeletal muscles of adiponectin KO mice which display decreased LC3 II expression and a myopathic phenotype (heterogeneous fiber sizes, numerous central nuclei). Overall, these findings demonstrate that gAd activates autophagy in myoblasts and that gAd-activated autophagy drives the myogenic properties of this hormone.

Abstract: β-Catenin, the central molecule of canonical Wnt signaling pathway, has multiple binding partners and performs many roles in the cell. Apart from being a transcriptional activator, β-catenin acts as a crucial effector component of cadherin/catenin complex to physically interact with actin cytoskeleton along with α-catenin and E-cadherin for regulating cell-cell adhesion. Here, we have generated a library of β-catenin point and deletion mutants to delineate regions within β-catenin that are important for α-catenin-β-catenin interaction, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activity of β-catenin. We observed a unique mechanism for nuclear localization of β-catenin and its mutants and show that N-terminal exon-3 region and C-terminal domain of β-catenin are critical for this activity of β-catenin. Furthermore, we show HepG2 cells have high β-catenin mediated transcriptional activity due to the presence of an interstitial deletion at the N-terminal region of β-catenin. Due to this deletion mutant (hereupon called TM), GSK3β and HDAC inhibitors failed to show any impact whereas curcumin significantly inhibited β-catenin mediated transcriptional activity reiterating that TM is primarily responsible for the high transcriptional activity of HepG2 cells. Moreover, we show the recombinant TM does not physically interact with α-catenin, localizes predominantly in the nucleus, and has nearly two-fold higher transcriptional activity than the wildtype β-catenin.

Abstract: More than 30 proteins (Pex proteins) are known to participate in the biogenesis of peroxisomes—ubiquitous oxidative organelles involved in lipid and ROS metabolism. The Pex11 family of homologous proteins is responsible for division and proliferation of peroxisomes. We show that yeast Pex11 is a pore-forming protein sharing sequence similarity with TRPM cation-selective channels. The Pex11 channel with a conductance of Λ=4.1nS in 1.0M KCl is moderately cation-selective (PK+/PCl−=1.85) and resistant to voltage-dependent closing. The estimated size of the channel's pore (r~0.6nm) supports the notion that Pex11 conducts solutes with molecular mass below 300–400Da. We localized the channel's selectivity determining sequence. Overexpression of Pex11 resulted in acceleration of fatty acids β-oxidation in intact cells but not in the corresponding lysates. The β-oxidation was affected in cells by expression of the Pex11 protein carrying point mutations in the selectivity determining sequence. These data suggest that the Pex11-dependent transmembrane traffic of metabolites may be a rate-limiting step in the β-oxidation of fatty acids. This conclusion was corroborated by analysis of the rate of β-oxidation in yeast strains expressing Pex11 with mutations mimicking constitutively phosphorylated (S165D, S167D) or unphosphorylated (S165A, S167A) protein. The results suggest that phosphorylation of Pex11 is a mechanism that can control the peroxisomal β-oxidation rate. Our results disclose an unexpected function of Pex11 as a non-selective channel responsible for transfer of metabolites across peroxisomal membrane. The data indicate that peroxins may be involved in peroxisomal metabolic processes in addition to their role in peroxisome biogenesis.

Epigenetic response to environmental stress: Assembly of BRG1–G9a/GLP–DNMT3 repressive chromatin complex on Myh6 promoter in pathologically stressed hearts,

Abstract: Chromatin structure is determined by nucleosome positioning, histone modifications, and DNA methylation. How chromatin modifications are coordinately altered under pathological conditions remains elusive. Here we describe a stress-activated mechanism of concerted chromatin modification in the heart. In mice, pathological stress activates cardiomyocytes to express Brg1 (nucleosome-remodeling factor), G9a/Glp (histone methyltransferase), and Dnmt3 (DNA methyltransferase). Once activated, Brg1 recruits G9a and then Dnmt3 to sequentially assemble repressive chromatin—marked by H3K9 and CpG methylation—on a key molecular motor gene (Myh6), thereby silencing Myh6 and impairing cardiac contraction. Disruption of Brg1, G9a or Dnmt3 erases repressive chromatin marks and de-represses Myh6, reducing stress-induced cardiac dysfunction. In human hypertrophic hearts, BRG1–G9a/GLP–DNMT3 complex is also activated; its level correlates with H3K9/CpG methylation, Myh6 repression, and cardiomyopathy. Our studies demonstrate a new mechanism of chromatin assembly in stressed hearts and novel therapeutic targets for restoring Myh6 and ventricular function. The stress-induced Brg1–G9a–Dnmt3 interactions and sequence of repressive chromatin assembly on Myh6 illustrates a molecular mechanism by which the heart epigenetically responds to environmental signals.

Melanoma antigen-D2: A nucleolar protein undergoing delocalization during cell cycle and after cellular stress,

Abstract: Melanoma antigen D2 (MAGE-D2) is recognized as a cancer diagnostic marker; however, it has poorly characterized functions. Here, we established its intracellular localization and shuttling during cell cycle progression and in response to cellular stress. In normal conditions, MAGE-D2 is present in the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm, and nucleoli. Within the latter, MAGE-D2 is mostly found in the granular and the dense fibrillar components, and it interacts with nucleolin. Transfection of MAGE-D2 deletion mutants demonstrated that Δ203–254 leads to confinement of MAGE-D2 to the cytoplasm, while Δ248–254 prevents its accumulation in nucleoli but still allows its presence in the nucleoplasm. Consequently, this short sequence belongs to a nucleolar localization signal. MAGE-D2 deletion does not alter the nucleolar organization or rRNA levels. However, its intracellular localization varies with the cell cycle in a different kinetic than nucleolin. After genotoxic and nucleolar stresses, MAGE-D2 is excluded from nucleoli and concentrates in the nucleoplasm. We demonstrated that its camptothecin-related delocalization results from two distinct events: a rapid nucleolar release and a slower phospho-ERK-dependent cytoplasm to nucleoplasm translocation, which results from an increased flux from the cytoplasm to nucleoplasm. In conclusion, MAGE-D2 is a dynamic protein whose shuttling properties could suggest a role in cell cycle regulation.

Abstract: E-prostanoid receptor subtype 2 (EP2) agonists are currently under clinical development as hypotensive agents for the treatment of ocular hypertension. However, the effects of EP2 receptor agonists on trabecular meshwork (TM) alterations leading to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) are still unknown. Here, we evaluated whether EP2 receptor activation exhibits protective functions on TM cell death induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We show that the EP2 receptor agonist butaprost protects TM cell death mediated by the ER stress inducer tunicamycin through a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent mechanism, but independent of the classical cAMP sensors, protein kinase A and exchange proteins activated by cAMP. The ER stress-induced intrinsic apoptosis inhibited by the EP2 receptor agonist was correlated with a decreased accumulation of the cellular stress sensor p53. In addition, p53 down-regulation was associated with inhibition of its transcriptional activity, which led to decreased expression of the pro-apoptotic p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). The stabilization of p53 by nutlin-3a abolished butaprost-mediated cell death protection. In conclusion, we showed that EP2 receptor activation protects against ER stress-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis through down-regulation of p53. The specific inhibition of this pathway could reduce TM alterations observed in POAG patients.

Abstract: The definitive role of ganglioside GM2 in mediating tumor-induced growth and progression is still unknown. Here we report a novel role of ganglioside GM2 in mediating tumor cell migration and uncovered its mechanism. Data shows differential expression levels of GM2-synthase as well as GM2 in different human cancer cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of GM2-synthase in CCF52, A549 and SK-RC-26B cells resulted in significant inhibition of tumor cell migration as well as invasion in vitro without affecting cellular proliferation. Over-expression of GM2-synthase in low-GM2 expressing SK-RC-45 cells resulted in a consequent increase in migration thus confirming the potential role GM2 and its downstream partners play in tumor cell migration and motility. Further, treatment of SK-RC-45 cells with exogenous GM2 resulted in a dramatic increase in migratory and invasive capacity with no change in proliferative capacity, thereby confirming the role of GM2 in tumorigenesis specifically by mediating tumor migration and invasion. Gene expression profiling of GM2-synthase silenced cells revealed altered expression of several genes involved in cell migration primarily those controlling the integrin mediated signaling. GM2-synthase knockdown resulted in decreased phosphorylation of FAK, Src as well as Erk, while over-expression and/or exogenous GM2 treatment caused increased FAK and Erk phosphorylation respectively. Again, GM2 mediated invasion and Erk phosphorylation is blocked in integrin knockdown SK-RC-45 cells, thus confirming that GM2 mediated migration and phosphorylation of Erk is integrin dependent. Finally, confocal microscopy suggested co-localization while co-immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) confirmed direct interaction of membrane bound ganglioside, GM2 with the integrin receptor.

Abstract: Filamin A (FLNA) is known to act as platform for the signaling and intracellular trafficking of various GPCRs including dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R, D3R). To understand molecular mechanisms involved in the FLNA-mediated regulation of D2R and D3R, comparative studies were conducted on the signaling and intracellular trafficking of the D2R and D3R in FLNA-knockdown cells, with a specific focus on the roles of the proteins that interact with FLNA and the D2R and D3R. Lowering the level of cellular FLNA caused an elevation in RalA activity and resulted in selective interference with the normal intracellular trafficking and signaling of the D2R and D3R, through GRK2 and β-arrestins, respectively. Knockdown of FLNA or coexpression of active RalA interfered with the recycling of the internalized D2R and resulted in the development of receptor tolerance. Active RalA was found to interact with GRK2 to sequester it from D2R. Knockdown of FLNA or coexpression of active RalA prevented D3R from coupling with G protein. The selective involvement of GRK2- and β-arrestins in the RalA-mediated cellular processes of the D2R and D3R was achieved via their different modes of interactions with the receptor and their distinct functional roles in receptor regulation. Our results show that FLNA is a multi-functional protein that acts as a platform on which D2R and D3R can interact with various proteins, through which selective regulation of these receptors occurs in combination with GRK2 and β-arrestins.

Abstract: Unfolded protein response (UPR) triggered as a consequence of ER stress has been shown to be involved in the development of different pathologies, including fibrotic disorders. In the present paper we explore the role played by UPR on a key fibrogenic parameter in the liver: collagen type I levels in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC). Using Brefeldin A (BFA) as an ER stress inducer we found that UPR correlated with enhanced mRNA and protein levels of collagen type I in a cell line of immortalized non-tumoral rat HSC. Analysis of the three branches of UPR revealed the activation of IRE1α, PERK and ATF6 in response to BFA, although PERK activation was shown not to be involved in the fibrogenic action of BFA. BFA also activated p38 MAPK in an IRE1α-dependent way and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 prevented the increase in collagen type I mRNA and protein levels caused by BFA, suggesting the involvement of this kinase on this effect. Analysis of Smad activation showed that phosphorylated nuclear levels of Smad2 and 3 were increased in response to BFA treatment. Inhibition of Smad3 phosphorylation by SIS3 prevented the enhancement of collagen type I levels caused by BFA. Pretreatment with IRE1α and p38 MAPK inhibitors also prevented the increased p-Smad3 accumulation in the nucleus, suggesting an IRE1α-p38 MAPK-Smad pathway to be responsible for the fibrogenic action of BFA on HSC.

Abstract: Starting from the late embryonic development, the sympathetic nervous system extensively innervates the heart and modulates its activity during the entire lifespan. The distribution of myocardial sympathetic processes is finely regulated by the secretion of limiting amounts of pro-survival neurotrophic factors by cardiac cells. Norepinephrine release by the neurons rapidly modulates myocardial electrophysiology, and increases the rate and force of cardiomyocyte contractions. Sympathetic processes establish direct interaction with cardiomyocytes, characterized by the presence of neurotransmitter vesicles and reduced cell–cell distance. Whether such contacts have a functional role in both neurotrophin- and catecholamine-dependent communication between the two cell types, is poorly understood. In this review we will address the effects of the sympathetic neuron activity on the myocardium and the hypothesis that the direct neuro-cardiac contact might have a key role both in norepinephrine and neurotrophin mediated signaling.

Abstract: Mitochondrial carriers (MCs) are a superfamily of nuclear-encoded proteins that are mostly localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane and transport numerous metabolites, nucleotides, cofactors and inorganic anions. Their unique sequence features, i.e., a tripartite structure, six transmembrane α-helices and a three-fold repeated signature motif, allow MCs to be easily recognized. This review describes how the functions of MCs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens and Arabidopsis thaliana (listed in the first table) were discovered after the genome sequence of S. cerevisiae was determined in 1996. In the genomic era, more than 50 previously unknown MCs from these organisms have been identified and characterized biochemically using a method consisting of gene expression, purification of the recombinant proteins, their reconstitution into liposomes and transport assays (EPRA). Information derived from studies with intact mitochondria, genetic and metabolic evidence, sequence similarity, phylogenetic analysis and complementation of knockout phenotypes have guided the choice of substrates that were tested in the transport assays. In addition, the diseases associated to defects of human MCs have been briefly reviewed.

Abstract: Cardiac transverse tubules (t-tubules) are specific membrane organelles critical in calcium signaling and excitation–contraction coupling required for beat-to-beat heart contraction. T-tubules are highly branched and form an interconnected network that penetrates the myocyte interior to form junctions with the sarcoplasmic reticulum. T-tubules are selectively enriched with specific ion channels and proteins crucial in calcium transient development necessary in excitation–contraction coupling, thus t-tubules are a key component of cardiac myocyte function. In this review, we focus primarily on two proteins concentrated within the t-tubular network, the L-type calcium channel (LTCC) and associated membrane anchor protein, bridging integrator 1 (BIN1). Here, we provide an overview of current knowledge in t-tubule morphology, composition, microdomains, as well as the dynamics of the t-tubule network. Secondly, we highlight multiple aspects of BIN1-dependent t-tubule function, which includes forward trafficking of LTCCs to t-tubules, LTCC clustering at t-tubule surface, microdomain organization and regulation at t-tubule membrane, and the formation of a slow diffusion barrier within t-tubules. Lastly, we describe progress in characterizing how acquired human heart failure can be attributed to abnormal BIN1 transcription and associated t-tubule remodeling. Understanding BIN1-regulated cardiac t-tubule biology in human heart failure management has the dual benefit of promoting progress in both biomarker development and therapeutic target identification.

Abstract: Our developmental studies provide an insight into the pathogenesis of heart failure in adults. These studies reveal a mechanistic link between fetal cardiomyocytes and pathologically stressed adult cardiomyocytes at the level of chromatin regulation. In embryos, chromatin-regulating factors within the cardiomyocytes respond to developmental signals to program cardiac gene expression to promote cell proliferation and inhibit premature cell differentiation. In the neonatal period, the activity of these developmental chromatin regulators is quickly turned off in cardiomyocytes, coinciding with the cessation of cell proliferation and advance in cell differentiation toward adult maturity. When the mature hearts are pathologically stressed, those chromatin regulators essential for cardiomyocyte development in embryos are reactivated, triggering gene reprogramming to a fetal-like state and pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, in the study of chromatin regulation and cardiac gene expression, we identified a long noncoding RNA that interacts with chromatin remodeling factor to regulate the cardiac response to environmental changes.

Abstract: The formation of tight cell-cell junctions is essential in the epidermis for its barrier properties. In this tissue, keratinocytes follow a differentiation program tightly associated with their movement from the innermost basal to the outer suprabasal layers, and with changes in their cell-cell adhesion profile. Intercellular adhesion in keratinocytes is mediated through cell-cell contacts, including E-cadherin-based adherens junctions. Although the mechanisms that mediate E-cadherin delivery to the plasma membrane have been widely studied in simple epithelia, this process is less well understood in the stratified epidermis. In this study, we have investigated the role of Engulfment and Cell Motility 2 (ELMO2) and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in the positioning of E-cadherin-containing recycling endosomes during establishment of cell-cell contacts in differentiating keratinocytes. We now show that induction of keratinocyte differentiation by Ca2+ is accompanied by localization of ELMO2 and ILK to Rab4- and Rab11a-containing recycling endosomes. The positioning of long-loop Rab11a-positive endosomes at areas adjacent to cell-cell contacts is disrupted in ELMO2- or ILK-deficient keratinocytes, and is associated with impaired localization of E-cadherin to cell borders. Our studies show a previously unrecognized role for ELMO2 and ILK in modulation of endosomal positioning, which may play key roles in epidermal sheet maintenance and permeability barrier function.

Abstract: Carnitine is essential for the transfer of long-chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane for subsequent β-oxidation. It can be synthesized by the body or assumed with the diet from meat and dairy products. Defects in carnitine biosynthesis do not routinely result in low plasma carnitine levels. Carnitine is accumulated by the cells and retained by kidneys using OCTN2, a high affinity organic cation transporter specific for carnitine. Defects in the OCTN2 carnitine transporter results in autosomal recessive primary carnitine deficiency characterized by decreased intracellular carnitine accumulation, increased losses of carnitine in the urine, and low serum carnitine levels. Patients can present early in life with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and hepatic encephalopathy, or later in life with skeletal and cardiac myopathy or sudden death from cardiac arrhythmia, usually triggered by fasting or catabolic state. This disease responds to oral carnitine that, in pharmacological doses, enters cells using the amino acid transporter B0,+. Primary carnitine deficiency can be suspected from the clinical presentation or identified by low levels of free carnitine (C0) in the newborn screening. Some adult patients have been diagnosed following the birth of an unaffected child with very low carnitine levels in the newborn screening. The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring low carnitine uptake in the patients' fibroblasts or by DNA sequencing of the SLC22A5 gene encoding the OCTN2 carnitine transporter. Some mutations are specific for certain ethnic backgrounds, but the majority are private and identified only in individual families. Although the genotype usually does not correlate with metabolic or cardiac involvement in primary carnitine deficiency, patients presenting as adults tend to have at least one missense mutation retaining residual activity.

Abstract: Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor that monitors ATP levels. There is also evidence that AMPK has onco-suppressive properties. Iron plays a crucial role in cellular energy transducing pathways and tumor cell proliferation. Therefore, metals (e.g., iron) could play an important role in the regulation of AMPK-dependent pathways. Hence, this investigation examined the effect of the iron and copper chelator and potent anti-cancer agent, di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT), on the AMPK-mediated pathway. These studies demonstrated that Dp44mT, which forms intracellular redox-active complexes with iron and copper, significantly activated AMPK (i.e., p-AMPK/AMPK ratio) in 5 different tumor cell-types. Furthermore, examination of the Dp44mT-metal complexes demonstrated that the effect of Dp44mT on AMPK was due to a dual mechanism: (1) its ability to chelate metal ions; and (2) the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The activation of the AMPK-pathway by Dp44mT was mediated by the upstream kinase, liver kinase B1 (LKB1) that is a known tumor suppressor. Moreover, using AMPKα1-selective silencing, we demonstrated that Dp44mT activated AMPK, resulting in inhibition of acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and raptor, and activation of Unc-51 like kinase (ULK1). These effects are vital for inhibition of fatty acid synthesis, suppression of protein synthesis and autophagic activation, respectively. Together, this AMPK-mediated repair response aims to rescue the loss of metal ions via chelation and the induction of cytotoxic damage mediated by redox cycling of the Dp44mT-metal ion complex. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that chelators target the AMPK-dependent pathway.

Abstract: Pharmacological inhibition of oxygen sensing prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs) has been shown to preserve renal structure and function in various models of kidney disease. Since transforming growth factor β-1 (TGFβ-1) is one of the major mediators of kidney injury, we investigated if inhibition of PHDs with subsequent stabilization of hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIF) might interfere with TGFβ-1 signaling with special emphasis on its target gene connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Overnight incubation of human renal tubular cells, primary cells and cell lines, with the PDH inhibitor DMOG increased Smad3 expression, but barely affected Smad2. Both Smads were translocated into the nucleus upon activation of the cells with TGFβ-1. Interestingly, Smad3 nuclear localization was enhanced upon pretreatment of the cells with DMOG for several hours, whereas nuclear Smad2 was reduced. This differential localization was independent of Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Reduced nuclear Smad2 correlated with impaired CTGF secretion in DMOG-treated cells and transient downregulation of Smad2 interfered with TGFβ-1-induced CTGF synthesis. Furthermore, YAP was confirmed as indispensable transcription factor involved in CTGF synthesis. Nuclear localization of YAP and TAZ was reduced in DMOG-treated cells. Our data thus provide evidence for DMOG-mediated reduction of CTGF expression by regulating the nuclear localization of the transcription factors Smad2, YAP and TAZ. Prolonged inhibition of PHDs was necessary to achieve alterations in cellular localization suggesting an indirect HIF-mediated effect. This mechanism might be extended to other transcription factors and target genes, and may thus represent a novel mechanism of negative regulation of gene expression by PHD inhibition.

Abstract: Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is an important member of the protein arginine methyltransferase family that regulates many cellular processes through epigenetic control of target gene expression. Because of its overexpression in a number of human cancers and its essential role in cell proliferation, transformation, and cell cycle progression, PRMT5 has been recently proposed to function as an oncoprotein in cancer cells. However, how its expression is regulated in cancer cells remains largely unknown. We have previously demonstrated that the transcription of PRMT5 can be negatively regulated by the PKC/c-Fos signaling pathway through modulating the transcription factor NF-Y in prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that PRMT5 undergoes polyubiquitination, possibly through multiple lysine residues. We also identified carboxyl terminus of heat shock cognate 70-interacting protein (CHIP), an important chaperone-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase that couples protein folding/refolding to protein degradation, as an interacting protein of PRMT5 via mass spectrometry. Their interaction was further verified by co-immuoprecipitation, GST pull-down, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. In addition, we provided evidence that the CHIP/chaperone system is essential for the negative regulation of PRMT5 expression via K48-linked ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Given that down-regulation of CHIP and overexpression of PRMT5 have been observed in several human cancers, our finding suggests that down-regulation of CHIP may be one of the mechanisms underlying PRMT5 overexpression in these cancers.

Abstract: The potent and selective anti-tumor agent, di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT), localizes in lysosomes and forms cytotoxic copper complexes that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and cell death. Herein, the role of lysosomal membrane stability in the anti-tumor activity of Dp44mT was investigated. Studies were performed using molecules that protect lysosomal membranes against Dp44mT-induced LMP, namely heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and cholesterol. Up-regulation or silencing of HSP70 expression did not affect Dp44mT-induced LMP in MCF7 cells. In contrast, cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes induced by the well characterized cholesterol transport inhibitor, 3-β-[2-(diethyl-amino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one (U18666A), inhibited Dp44mT-induced LMP and markedly and significantly (p<0.001) reduced the ability of Dp44mT to inhibit cancer cell proliferation (i.e., increased the IC50) by 140-fold. On the other hand, cholesterol extraction using methyl-β-cyclodextrin enhanced Dp44mT-induced LMP and significantly (p<0.01) increased its anti-proliferative activity. The protective effect of U18666A in increasing lysosomal cholesterol and preventing the cytotoxic activity of Dp44mT was not due to induced autophagy. Instead, U18666A was found to decrease lysosomal turnover, resulting in autophagosome accumulation. Moreover, preincubation with U18666A did not prevent the ability of Dp44mT to induce autophagosome synthesis, indicating that autophagic initiation via Dp44mT occurs independently of LMP. These studies demonstrate the significance of lysosomal membrane stability in relation to the ability of Dp44mT to execute tumor cell death and overcome pro-survival autophagy. Hence, lysosomal-dependent cell death induced by Dp44mT serves as an important anti-tumor strategy. These results are important for comprehensively understanding the mechanism of action of Dp44mT.

Abstract: p21-Activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase implicated in cytoskeletal remodeling and cell motility. Recent studies have shown that it also promotes cell proliferation, regulates apoptosis, and increases cell transformation and invasion. In this study, we showed that NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NOTCH1-IC) negatively regulated PAK1 signaling pathway. We found a novel interaction between NOTCH1-IC and PAK1. Overexpression of NOTCH1-IC decreased PAK1-induced integrin-linked kinase 1 (ILK1) phosphorylation, whereas inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling increased PAK1-induced ILK1 phosphorylation. Notably, ILK1 phosphorylation was higher in PS1,2−/− cells than in PS1,2+/+ cells. As expected, overexpression of NOTCH1-IC decreased ILK1-induced phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3beta). Furthermore, NOTCH1-IC disrupted the interaction of PAK1 with ILK1 and altered PAK1 localization by directly interacting with it. This inhibitory effect of NOTCH1-IC on the PAK1 signaling pathway was mediated by the binding of NOTCH1-IC to PAK1 and by the alteration of PAK1 localization. Together, these results suggest that NOTCH1-IC is a new regulator of the PAK1 signaling pathway that directly interacts with PAK1 and regulates its shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

Abstract: The calcium signaling protein calmodulin (CaM) interacts with many target proteins inside the cell to regulate a wide range of biological signals. CaM's availability to propagate signals depends on its mobility, which may be regulated by interactions with multiple target proteins. We detected single molecules of CaM labeled with a fluorescent dye and injected into living HEK 293 cells, and we used high-speed, wide-field, single-molecule imaging to track single CaM molecules. Single-molecule trajectories were analyzed to characterize the motions of individual CaM molecules. Single-molecule localization resolved CaM positions with a position accuracy of <100nm, permitting sub-diffraction imaging of features with localized CaM that form in response to increased free Ca2+. Single-molecule tracking demonstrated the presence of a wide range of mobilities of individual calmodulin molecules in a cell, with diffusion coefficients ranging from <0.01μm2s−1 to ~5μm2 s−1, whereas analysis by spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy revealed faster-moving components with diffusion coefficients of >10μm2s−1. For molecules confined to small regions of the cell, super-resolved images of presumed signaling complexes were recovered. Individual trajectories were classified as normal diffusion, confined diffusion, or directed motion, and could suggest how the individual CaM molecules were bound in the cell. The results show that interactions of CaM with target proteins result in decreased translational mobilities of a significant fraction of CaM molecules inside cells. The work presented here illustrates methods that can characterize location, mobilities, and the availability of signaling molecules in live cells.

Abstract: Mechanotransduction refers to the conversion of mechanical forces into biochemical or electrical signals that initiate structural and functional remodeling in cells and tissues. The heart is a kinetic organ whose form changes considerably during development and disease. This requires cardiomyocytes to be mechanically durable and able to mount coordinated responses to a variety of environmental signals on different time scales, including cardiac pressure loading and electrical and hemodynamic forces. During physiological growth, myocytes, endocardial and epicardial cells have to adaptively remodel to these mechanical forces. Here we review some of the recent advances in the understanding of how mechanical forces influence cardiac development, with a focus on fluid flow forces. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Cardiomyocyte Biology: Integration of Developmental and Environmental Cues in the Heart edited by Marcus Schaub and Hughes Abriel.

Abstract: β-Amyloid (Aβ), a hallmark peptide of Alzheimer's disease, induces both caspase-dependent apoptosis and non-apoptotic cell death. In this study, we examined caspase-independent non-apoptotic cell death preceding caspase activation in Aβ42-treated cells. We first determined the optimal treatment conditions for inducing cell death without caspase activation and selected a double-treatment method involving the incubation of cells with Aβ42 for 4 and 6h (4+6h sample). We observed that levels of lamin A (LA) and lamin B (LB) were reduced in the 4+6h samples. This reduction was decreased by treatment with suc-AAPF-CMK, an inhibitor of nuclear scaffold (NS) protease, but not by treatment with z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor. In addition, suc-AAPF-CMK decreased the changes in nuclear morphology observed in cells in the 4+6h samples, which were different from nuclear fragmentation observed in STS-treated cells. Furthermore, suc-AAPF-CMK inhibited cell death in the 4+6h samples. LA and LB fragmentation occurred in the isolated nuclei and was also inhibited by suc-AAPF-CMK. Together, these data indicated that the fragmentation of LA and LB in the Aβ42-treated cells was induced by an NS protease, whose identity is not clearly determined yet. A correlation between Aβ42 toxicity and the lamin fragmentation by NS protease suggests that inhibition of the protease could be an effective method for controlling the pathological process of AD.

Abstract: Osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 is essential for osteoblast differentiation. The activity of Runx2 is tightly regulated at transcriptional as well as post-translational level. However, regulation of Runx2 stability by ubiquitin mediated proteasomal degradation by E3 ubiquitin ligases is little-known. Here, for the first time we demonstrate that Skp2, an SCF family E3 ubiquitin ligase negatively targets Runx2 by promoting its polyubiquitination and proteasome dependent degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that Skp2 physically interacts with Runx2 both in a heterologous as well as physiologically relevant system. Functional consequences of Runx2–Skp2 physical interaction were then assessed by promoter reporter assay. We show that Skp2-mediated downregulation of Runx2 led to reduced Runx2 transactivation and osteoblast differentiation. On the contrary, inhibition of Skp2 restored Runx2 levels and promoted osteoblast differentiation. We further show that Skp2 and Runx2 proteins are co-expressed and show inverse relation in vivo such as in lactating, ovariectomized and estrogen-treated ovariectomized animals. Together, these data demonstrate that Skp2 targets Runx2 for ubiquitin mediated degradation and hence negatively regulate osteogenesis. Therefore, the present study provides a plausible therapeutic target for osteoporosis or cleidocranial dysplasia caused by the heterozygous mutation of Runx2 gene.

Abstract: Background
In contrast to other members of the EGF receptor family, ErbB3 is constitutively internalized in a clathrin-dependent manner. Previous studies have shown that ErbB3 does not interact with the coated pit localized adaptor complex 2 (AP-2), and that ErbB3 lacks two AP-2 interacting internalization signals identified in the EGF receptor. Several other clathrin-associated sorting proteins which may recruit cargo into coated pits have, however, been identified, and the study was performed to identify adaptors needed for constitutive internalization of ErbB3.
Methods
A high-throughput siRNA screen was used to identify adaptor proteins needed for internalization of ErbB3. Upon knock-down of candidate proteins internalization of ErbB3 was identified using an antibody-based internalization assay combined with automatic fluorescence microscopy.
Results
Among 29 candidates only knock-down of epsin 1 turned out to inhibit ErbB3. Epsin 1 has ubiquitin interacting motifs (UIMs) and we show that ErbB3 interacts with an epsin 1 deletion mutant containing these UIMs. In support of an ErbB3-epsin 1 UIM dependent interaction, we show that ErbB3 is constitutively ubiquitinated, but that both ubiquitination and the ErbB3-epsin 1 interaction increase upon ligand binding.
Conclusion
Altogether the results are consistent with a model whereby both constitutive and ligand-induced internalization of ErbB3 are regulated through interaction with epsin 1.
General significance
Internalization is an important regulator of growth factor receptor mediated signaling and the current study identify mechanisms regulating plasma membrane turnover of ErbB3.

Abstract: Abnormal expression of claudin subtypes has been reported in various cancers. However, the pathological role of each claudin has not been clarified in detail. Claudin-18 was absent in human non-small cell and small cell lung cancers, although it is expressed in normal lung tissues. Here, we examined the effect of claudin-18 expression on the expression of junctional proteins, cell proliferation, and cell motility using human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Real-time PCR and western blotting showed that exogenous expression of claudin-18 had no effect on the expression of junctional proteins including claudin-1, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, and E-cadherin. Claudin-18 was mainly distributed in cell–cell contact areas concomitant with ZO-1. Cell proliferation was significantly decreased at 48 and 72h after seeding of claudin 18-expressing cells. Claudin-18 suppressed cell motility, whereas it increased cell death in anoikis. Claudin-18 decreased phosphorylated (p)-3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and p-Akt levels without affecting p-epidermal growth factor receptor and p-phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) levels. Furthermore, claudin-18 was bound with PDK1 and suppressed the nuclear localization of PDK1. We suggest that claudin-18 suppresses the abnormal proliferation and motility of lung epithelial cells mediated by inhibition of the PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling pathway.

Abstract: Inappropriate cardiac interstitial remodeling is mediated by activated phenoconverted myofibroblasts. The synthesis of matrix proteins by these cells is triggered by both chemical and mechanical stimuli. Ski is a repressor of TGFβ1/Smad signaling and has been described as possessing anti-fibrotic properties within the myocardium. We hypothesized that overexpression of Ski in myofibroblasts will induce an apoptotic response, which may either be supported or opposed by autophagic flux. We used primary myofibroblasts (activated fibroblasts) which were sourced from whole heart preparations that were only passaged once. We found that overexpression of Ski results in distinct morphological and biochemical changes within primary cardiac myofibroblasts associated with apoptosis. Ski treatment was associated with the expression of pro-apoptotic factors such as Bax, caspase-7, and -9. Our results indicate that Ski triggers a pro-death mechanism in primary rat cardiac myofibroblasts that is mediated through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Myofibroblast survival is prolonged by an autophagic response, as the dataset indicate that apoptosis is hastened when autophagy is inhibited. We suggest that the apoptotic death response of myofibroblasts is working in parallel with the previously observed anti-fibrotic properties of Ski within this cell type. As myofibroblasts are the sole mediators of matrix expansion in heart failure, we suggest that Ski, or a putative Ski-mimetic, may induce graded apoptosis in myofibroblasts within the failing heart and may be a novel therapeutic approach towards controlling cardiac fibrosis. Future studies are needed to examine the potential effects of Ski overexpression on other cell types in the heart.

Abstract: Attachment of peroxisomes to cytoskeleton and movement along microtubular filaments and actin cables are essential and highly regulated processes enabling metabolic efficiency, biogenesis, maintenance and inheritance of this dynamic cellular compartment. Several peroxisome-associated proteins have been identified, which mediate interaction with motor proteins, adaptor proteins or other constituents of the cytoskeleton. It appears that there is a species-specific complexity of protein–protein interactions required to control directional movement and arresting. An open question is why some proteins with a specific role in peroxisomal protein import have an additional function in the regulation of cytoskeleton binding and motility of peroxisomes. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Peroxisomes edited by Ralf Erdmann.

Abstract: Protein folding, topogenesis and intracellular targeting of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) must be precisely coordinated to ensure correct receptor localization. To elucidate how different steps of GPCR biosynthesis work together, we investigated the process of membrane topology determination and how it relates to the acquisition of cell surface trafficking competence in human GPR34. By monitoring a fused FLAG-tag and a conformation-sensitive native epitope during the expression of GPR34 mutant panel, a tri-basic motif in the first intracellular loop was identified as the key topogenic signal that dictates the orientation of transmembrane domain-1 (TM1). Charge disruption of the motif perturbed topogenic processes and resulted in the conformational epitope loss, post-translational processing alteration, and trafficking arrest in the Golgi. The placement of a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence as a surrogate topogenic determinant overcame the effects of tri-basic motif mutations and rectified the TM1 orientation; thereby restored the conformational epitope, post-translational modifications, and cell surface trafficking altogether. Progressive N-tail truncation and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a proline-rich segment of the N-tail and all four cysteines individually located in the four separate extracellular regions must simultaneously reside in the ER lumen to muster the conformational epitope. Oxidation of all four cysteines was necessary for the epitope formation, but the cysteine residues themselves were not required for the trafficking event. The underlying biochemical properties of the conformational epitope was therefore the key to understand mechanistic processes propelled by positive-inside rule that simultaneously regulate the topogenesis and intracellular trafficking of GPR34.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are important seed cells for tissue engineering and are promising targets for cell-based therapies. However, the replicative senescence of MSCs during in vitro culture limits their research and clinical applications. The molecular mechanisms underlying the replicative senescence of MSCs are not fully understood. Evidence suggests that miRNAs play important roles in replicative senescence. A microarray analysis found that the miR-29c-3p level was significantly increased during the MSC senescence process. In our study, we investigated the roles of miR-29c-3p in senescence of MSCs. We cultured MSCs for long periods of time, up and down-regulated the miR-29c-3p expression in MSCs, and examined the senescent phenotype changes. The over-expression of miR-29c-3p led to enhanced senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), senescence associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF), reduced proliferation ability, retarded osteogenic differentiation and corresponding changes in senescence markers, whereas the miR-29c-3p down-regulation had the opposite results. Dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that CNOT6 is the target gene of miR-29c-3p. Knockdown of CNOT6 confirmed its inhibitory effects on the senescence of MSCs. In addition, Western blot results showed that both the p53–p21 and the p16–pRB pathways were activated during the miR-29c-3p-induced senescence of MSCs. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-29c-3p promotes the senescence of MSCs by targeting CNOT6 through p53–p21 and p16–pRB pathways and highlight the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to stem cell senescence.

Abstract: Chemoresistance is a major barrier for tumor chemotherapy. It is well-known that chemoresistance increases with tumor progression. Chemoresistance is altered by both genetic mutations and the alteration of extracellular microenvironment. Particularly, the extracellular matrix (ECM) is remodeled during tumor progression. Therefore, ECM remodeling is expected to cause the acquisition of chemoresistance in highly malignant tumor tissue. Here, we prepared cultured cell-derived decellularized matrices that mimic native ECM in tumor tissues at different stages of malignancy, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance was compared among these matrices. 5-FU resistance of colorectal tumor cells increased on the matrices derived from highly malignant tumor HT-29 cells, although the resistance did not increase on the matrices derived from low malignant tumor SW480 cells and normal CCD-841-CoN cells. The resistance on HT-29 cell-derived matrices increased through the activation of Akt and the upregulation of ABCB1 and ABCC1 without cell growth promotion, suggesting that ECM remodeling plays important roles in the acquisition of chemoresistance during tumor progression. It is expected that our decellularized matrices, or “staged tumorigenesis-mimicking matrices”, will become preferred cell culture substrates for in vitro analysis of comprehensive ECM roles in chemoresistance and the screening and pharmacokinetic analysis of anti-cancer drugs.

Abstract: The spreading of adhering cells is a morphogenetic process during which cells break spherical or radial symmetry and adopt migratory polarity with spatially segregated protruding cell front and non-protruding cell rear. The organization and regulation of these symmetry-breaking events, which are both complex and stochastic, are not fully understood. Here we show that in radially spreading cells, symmetry breaking commences with the development of discrete non-protruding regions characterized by large but sparse focal adhesions and long peripheral actin bundles. Establishment of this non-protruding static region specifies the distally oriented protruding cell front and thus determines the polarity axis and the direction of cell migration. The development of non-protruding regions requires ERK2 and the ERK pathway scaffold protein RACK1. RACK1 promotes adhesion-mediated activation of ERK2 that in turn inhibits p190A-RhoGAP signaling by reducing the peripheral localization of p190A-RhoGAP. We propose that sustained ERK signaling at the prospective cell rear induces p190A-RhoGAP depletion from the cell periphery resulting in peripheral actin bundles and cell rear formation. Since cell adhesion activates both ERK and p190A-RhoGAP signaling this constitutes a spatially confined incoherent feed-forward signaling circuit.

Abstract: Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP) is a nuclear transcriptional co-factor that has additional functions in the myoplasm as a component of the muscle sarcomere. Previous studies have demonstrated increased expression of CARP in cardiovascular diseases, however, its role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis is unclear and controversial. In the present study, we investigated possible roles of CARP in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) -induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the underlying mechanisms. Neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated and infected with adenovirus encoding Flag-tagged CARP (Ad-CARP) and lentivirus encoding CARP targeted shRNA (sh-CARP), respectively. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by exposure to H/R conditions was evaluated by TUNEL staining and western blot analysis of cleaved caspase-3. The results showed that H/R-induced apoptosis was significantly decreased in Ad-CARP cardiomyocytes and increased in sh-CARP cardiomyocytes, suggesting a protective anti-apoptosis role for CARP. Interestingly, over-expressed CARP was mainly distributed in the nucleus, consistent with its role in regulating transcriptional activity. qPCR analysis showed that Bcl-2 transcripts were significantly increased in Ad-CARP cardiomyocytes. ChIP and co-IP assays confirmed the binding of CARP to the Bcl-2 promoter through interaction with transcription factor GATA4. Collectively, our results suggest that CARP can protect against H/R induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, possibly through increasing anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 gene expression.

Abstract: To ensure accurate chromosome segregation, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) delays anaphase onset by preventing the premature activation of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) until all kinetochores are attached to the spindle. Although an escape from mitosis in the presence of unsatisfied SAC has been shown in several cancer cells, it has not been reported in oocyte meiosis. Here, we show that CDK7 activity is required to prevent a bypass of SAC during meiosis I in mouse oocytes. Inhibition of CDK7 using THZ1 accelerated the first meiosis, leading to chromosome misalignment, lag of chromosomes during chromosome segregation, and a high incidence of aneuploidy. Notably, this acceleration occurred in the presence of SAC proteins including Mad2 and Bub3 at the kinetochores. However, inhibition of APC/C-mediated cyclin B degradation blocked the THZ1-induced premature polar body extrusion. Moreover, chromosomal defects mediated by THZ1 were rescued when anaphase onset was delayed. Collectively, our results show that CDK7 activity is required to prevent premature anaphase onset by suppressing the bypass of SAC, thus ensuring chromosome alignment and proper segregation. These findings reveal new roles of CDK7 in the regulation of meiosis in mammalian oocytes.

Abstract: Defect in membrane repair contributes to the development of limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy. In healthy skeletal muscle, unraveling membrane repair mechanisms requires to establish an exhaustive list of the components of the resealing machinery. Here we show that human myotubes rendered deficient for Annexin-A5 (AnxA5) suffer from a severe defect in membrane resealing. This defect is rescued by the addition of recombinant AnxA5 while an AnxA5 mutant, which is unable to form 2D protein arrays, has no effect. Using correlative light and electron microscopy, we show that AnxA5 binds to the edges of the torn membrane, as early as a few seconds after sarcolemma injury, where it probably self-assembles into 2D arrays. In addition, we observed that membrane resealing is associated with the presence of a cluster of lipid vesicles at the wounded site. AnxA5 is present at the surface of these vesicles and may thus participate in plugging the cell membrane disruption. Finally, we show that AnxA5 behaves similarly in myotubes from a muscle cell line established from a patient suffering from LGMD2B, a myopathy due to dysferlin mutations, which indicates that trafficking of AnxA5 during sarcolemma damage is independent of the presence of dysferlin.

Abstract: Voltage Dependent Anion-selective Channel 2 (VDAC2) contributes to oxidative metabolism by sharing a role in solute transport across the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) with other isoforms of the VDAC family, VDAC1 and VDAC3. Recent studies revealed that VDAC2 also has a distinctive role in mediating sarcoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria local Ca2+ transport at least in cardiomyocytes, which is unlikely to be explained simply by the expression level of VDAC2. Furthermore, a strictly isoform-dependent VDAC2 function was revealed in the mitochondrial import and OMM-permeabilizing function of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, primarily Bak in many cell types. In addition, emerging evidence indicates a variety of other isoform-specific engagements for VDAC2. Since VDAC isoforms display 75% sequence similarity, the distinctive structure underlying VDAC2-specific functions is an intriguing problem. In this paper we summarize studies of VDAC2 structure and functions, which suggest a fundamental and exclusive role for VDAC2 in health and disease.

Abstract: Resident cardiac Sca-1-positive (+) stem cells may differentiate into cardiomyocytes to improve the function of damaged hearts. However, little is known about the inducers and molecular mechanisms underlying the myogenic conversion of Sca-1+ stem cells. Here we report that sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), a naturally occurring bioactive lipid, induces the myogenic conversion of Sca-1+ stem cells, as evidenced by the increased expression of cardiac transcription factors (Nkx2.5 and GATA4), structural proteins (cardiac Troponin T), transcriptional enhancer (Mef2c) and GATA4 nucleus translocation. First, SPC activated JNK and STAT3, and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 or STAT3 inhibitor stattic impaired the SPC-induced expression of cardiac transcription factors and GATA4 nucleus translocation, which suggests that JNK and STAT3 participated in SPC-promoted cardiac differentiation. Moreover, STAT3 activation was inhibited by SP600125, whereas JNK was inhibited by β-cyclodextrin as a lipid raft breaker, which indicates a lipid raft/JNK/STAT3 pathway involved in SPC-induced myogenic transition. β-Catenin, degraded by activated GSK3β, was inhibited by SPC. Furthermore, GSK3β inhibitors weakened but the β-catenin inhibitor promoted SPC-induced differentiation. We found no crosstalk between the lipid raft/JNK/STAT3 and β-catenin pathway. Our study describes a lipid, SPC, as an endogenic inducer of myogenic conversion in Sca-1+ stem cells with low toxicity and high efficiency for uptake.

Abstract: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency has been revealed to be involved in the efficacy to anti-cancer therapy but the mechanism remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the anti-cancer mechanism of G6PD deficiency. In our study, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and shRNA technology were used for inhibiting the activity of G6PD of cervical cancer cells. Peak Force QNM Atomic Force Microscopy was used to assess the changes of topography and biomechanical properties of cells and detect the effects on living cells in a natural aqueous environment. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe cell morphology. Moreover, a laser scanning confocal microscope was used to observe the alterations in cytoskeleton to explore the involved mechanism. When G6PD was inhibited by DHEA or RNA interference, the abnormal Young's modulus and increased roughness of cell membrane were observed in HeLa cells, as well as the idioblasts. Simultaneously, G6PD deficiency resulted in decreased HeLa cells migration and proliferation ability but increased ROS generation inducing apoptosis. What's more, the inhibition of G6PD activity caused the disorganization of microfilaments and microtubules of cytoskeletons and cell shrinkage. Our results indicated the anti-cervix cancer mechanism of G6PD deficiency may be involved with the decreased cancer cells migration and proliferation ability as a result of abnormal reorganization of cell cytoskeleton and abnormal biomechanical properties caused by the increased ROS. Suppression of G6PD may be a promising strategy in developing novel therapeutic methods for cervical cancer.

Abstract: Biogenesis of the primary cilium, a cellular organelle mediating various signaling pathways, is generally coordinated with cell cycle exit/re-entry. Although the dynamic cell cycle-associated profile of the primary cilium has been largely accepted, the mechanism governing the link between ciliogenesis and cell cycle progression has been poorly understood. Using a human genome-wide RNAi screen, we identify genes encoding subunits of the spliceosome and proteasome as novel regulators of ciliogenesis. We demonstrate that 1) the mRNA processing-related hits are essential for RNA expression of molecules acting in cilia disassembly, such as AURKA and PLK1, and 2) the ubiquitin–proteasome systems (UPS)-involved hits are necessary for proteolysis of molecules acting in cilia assembly, such as IFT88 and CPAP. In particular, we show that these screen hit-associated mechanisms are crucial for both cilia assembly and cell cycle arrest in response to serum withdrawal. Finally, our data suggest that the mRNA processing mechanism may modulate the UPS-dependent decay of cilia assembly regulators to control ciliary resorption-coupled cell cycle re-entry.

Abstract: Health and homoeostasis are maintained by a dynamic balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion. Mitochondrial fusion machinery is largely unknown in mammals. Only a few reports have illustrated the role of Fzo1 in mitochondrial fusion known in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1) interacts with and constitutively ubiquitinates the mammalian homolog, Mitofusin1 (Mfn1) via K63 linkages. In mice models, loss of Mgrn1 function leads to severe developmental defects and adult-onset spongiform neurodegeneration, similar to prion diseases. The tethering of mitochondria to form the ~180kDa Mfn1 complex is independent of MGRN1-mediated ubiquitination. However, successful mitochondrial fusion requires formation of higher oligomers of Mfn1 which in turn needs GTPase activity, intact heptad repeats of Mfn1 and ubiquitination by MGRN1. Following ubiquitination, proteasomal processing of Mfn1 completes the mitochondrial fusion process. This step requires functional p97 activity. These findings suggest a sequence of events where GTPase activity of Mfn1 and tethering of adjacent mitochondria precedes its MGRN1-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation culminating in mitochondrial fusion.

Abstract: Aging is associated to cognitive decline and susceptibility to neuron death, two processes related recently to subcellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Memory storage relies on mushroom spines stability that depends on store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). In addition, Ca2+ transfer from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria sustains energy production but mitochondrial Ca2+ overload promotes apoptosis. We have addressed whether SOCE and ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer are influenced by culture time in long-term cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, a model of neuronal aging. We found that short-term cultured neurons show large SOCE, low Ca2+ store content and no functional coupling between ER and mitochondria. In contrast, in long-term cultures reflecting aging neurons, SOCE is essentially lost, Stim1 and Orai1 are downregulated, Ca2+ stores become overloaded, Ca2+ release is enhanced, expression of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) increases and most Ca2+ released from the ER is transferred to mitochondria. These results suggest that neuronal aging is associated to increased ER-mitochondrial cross talking and loss of SOCE. This subcellular Ca2+ remodeling might contribute to cognitive decline and susceptibility to neuron cell death in the elderly.

Abstract: A distinct feature of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is its ability to trigger both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent signalling, culminating in activation of pro-inflammatory NF-κB and/or the antiviral IRF3. Although TLR4 agonists (lipopolysaccharides; LPSs) derived from different bacterial species have different endotoxic activity, the impact of LPS chemotype on the downstream signalling is not fully understood. Notably, different TLR4 agonists exhibit anti-tumoural activity in animal models of glioma, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Thus, we investigated the impact of LPS chemotype on the signalling events in the human glioma cell line U251. We found that LPS of Escherichia coli origin (LPSEC) leads to NF-κB-biased downstream signalling compared to Salmonella minnesota-derived LPS (LPSSM). Exposure of U251 cells to LPSEC resulted in faster nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65, higher NF-κB-activity and expression of its targets genes, and higher amount of secreted IL-6 compared to LPSSM. Using super-resolution microscopy we showed that the biased agonism of TLR4 in glioma cells is neither a result of differential regulation of receptor density nor of formation of higher order oligomers. Consistent with previous reports, LPSEC-mediated NF-κB activation led to significantly increased U251 proliferation, whereas LPSSM-induced IRF3 activity negatively influenced their invasiveness. Finally, treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) selectively increased LPSSM-induced nuclear translocation of p65 and NF-κB activity without affecting IRF3. Our data may explain how TLR4 agonists differently affect glioma cell proliferation and migration.

Abstract: Pathologic cardiac growth is an adaptive response of the myocardium to various forms of systemic (e.g. pressure overload) or genetically-based (e. g. mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins) stress. It represents a key aspect of different types of heart disease including aortic stenosis (AS) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). While many of the pathophysiological and hemodynamical aspects of pathologic cardiac hypertrophy have been uncovered during the last decades, its underlying metabolic determinants are only beginning to come into focus. Here, we review the epidemiological evidence and pathological features of hypertrophic heart disease in AS and HCM and consider in this context the development of microenvironmental tissue hypoxia as a key component of the heart's growth response to pathologic stress. We particularly reflect on recent evidence illustrating how activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) drives glycolytic and fructolytic metabolic programs to maintain ATP generation and support anabolic growth of the pathologically-stressed heart. Finally we discuss how this metabolic programs, when protracted, deprive the heart of energy leading ultimately to heart failure.

Abstract: Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that low concentrations of ouabain increase blood pressure in rats associated with stimulation of NaK ATPase activity and activation of the Src signaling cascade in NHE1-dependent manner. Proteomic analysis of human kidney proximal tubule cells (HKC11) suggested that the Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) as an ouabain-associating protein. We hypothesize that ouabain-induced stimulation of NaK ATPase activity is mediated through AT1R. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of ouabain on renal cell angiotensin II production, the effect of AT1R inhibition on ouabain-stimulated NKA activity, and the effect of ouabain on NKA-AT1R association. Ouabain increased plasma angiotensin II levels in rats treated with ouabain (1μg/kg body wt./day) for 9days and increased angiotensin II levels in cell culture media after 24h treatment with ouabain in human (HKC11), mouse (MRPT), and human adrenal cells. Ouabain 10pM stimulated NKA-mediated 86Rb uptake and phosphorylation of EGFR, Src, and ERK1/2. These effects were prevented by the AT1R receptor blocker candesartan. FRET and TIRF microscopy using Bodipy-labeled ouabain and mCherry-NKA or mCherry-AT1R demonstrated association of ouabain with AT1R and NKA. Further our FRET and TIRF studies demonstrated increased association between AT1R and NKA upon treatment with low dose ouabain. We conclude that ouabain stimulates NKA in renal proximal tubule cells through an angiotensin/AT1R-dependent mechanism and that this pathway contributes to cardiac glycoside associated hypertension.

Abstract: Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is characterized by therapeutic resistance and frequent tumor relapse. It has been suggested that UC are driven by a rare subset of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In order to understand UC recurrence post therapy, we investigated the behavior of urothelial CSCs after exposure to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, gemcitabine (GC) and mitomycin (MM). Although, the role of autophagy in CSC maintenance is well documented, the relationship of autophagy and CSCs with respect to drug resistance remains elusive. In the present study, we found that both GC and MM increased the percentage of CSCs in primary cultured urothelial carcinoma cells (UCC). These CSCs exhibited higher autophagy flux and higher expression of glycolytic genes. Inhibition of autophagy led to decrease in the expression of glycolysis genes. Inhibition of autophagy and glycolysis caused decrease in expression of stemness genes (Oct-4, Nanog), drug resistance genes (ABCG2, MDR1) and sensitized CSCs to GC and MM induced apoptosis. This finding suggests that autophagy and glycolysis may play a central role in drug resistance. Altogether, we conclude that autophagy may support cell survival by buffering bioenergetic demands for maintenance of high glycolytic flux in CSCs. Therefore, autophagy-based, “customized” combinatorial approaches may provide a new method to counter CSC-driven resistance and may prevent relapse in UC. The synergistic cytotoxic effect of GC/ MM with autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine) or with glycolytic inhibitor (2-deoxyglucose) may be of help in improving the outcome in patients with urothelial carcinoma of urinary bladder.

A pepducin designed to modulate P2Y2R function interacts with FPR2 in human neutrophils and transfers ATP to an NADPH-oxidase-activating ligand through a receptor cross-talk mechanism,

Abstract: Several G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can be activated or inhibited in a specific manner by membrane-permeable pepducins, which are short palmitoylated peptides with amino acid sequences identical to an intracellular domain of the receptor to be targeted. Unlike the endogenous P2Y2R agonist ATP, the P2Y2PalIC2 pepducin, which has an amino acid sequence corresponding to the second intracellular loop of the human ATP receptor (P2Y2R), activated the superoxide anion-generating NADPH-oxidase in neutrophils. In addition to having a direct effect on neutrophils, the P2Y2R pepducin converted naïve neutrophils to a primed state, which secondarily responded to ATP by producing superoxide. A pepducin with a peptide identical to the third intracellular loop of P2Y2R (P2Y2PalIC3) exhibited the same basic functions as P2Y2PalIC2, whereas one with a peptide that was identical to the first intracellular loop (P2Y2PalIC1) lacked these functions. The responses induced in neutrophils by the P2Y2R pepducins were not inhibited by the P2Y2R antagonist AR-C118925, and the receptor desensitization profile suggested the involvement of FPR2 rather than P2Y2R. Accordingly, antagonists/inhibitors of FPR2 attenuated the activities of the P2Y2R pepducins, which also selectively activated FPR2-overexpressing cells. In summary, we show that pepducins supposed to target P2Y2R activate human neutrophils through FPR2. We also show that the P2Y2PalIC2 pepducin can convert ATP from a non-activating agent to a potent neutrophil NADPH-oxidase activator. The molecular basis of this phenomenon involves cross-talk between the receptor/ligand pairs of P2Y2R/ATP and FPR2/P2Y2-pepducin.

Abstract: In budding yeast, growth through fermentation and/or respiration is dependent on the type of carbon source present in the medium. SAGA complex is the main acetylation complex and is required, together with Rtg factors, for nucleus-mitochondria communication and transcriptional activation of specific nuclear genes. Even though acetylation is necessary for mitochondria activity and respiratory pathways the direct role of histone acetyltransferases and SAGA complex has never been investigated directly. In this study we demonstrate, for the first time, that Gcn5 and SAGA are needed for respiratory metabolism and oxygen consumption. According to a central role for acetylation in respiration we find that the Gcn5 inhibitor CPTH2 had higher efficacy on cells grown in glycerol containing media. We also demonstrated that the opposing activities of Gcn5 and Hda1 modify selectively H3-AcK18 and are essential for respiration. Taken together our results suggest a novel paradigm coupling acetyltransferase activity to respiratory metabolism. Correspondingly we propose the selective utilization of KAT inhibitor CPTH2, combined to the modulation of the respiratory metabolism of the cell, as a promising novel tool of intervention in cancer cells.

Abstract: Ubiquitination, a post-translational modification, involves the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the target protein. The ubiquitin–proteasome pathway and the endosome–lysosome pathway control the degradation of the majority of eukaryotic proteins. Our previous study illustrated that δ-catenin ubiquitination occurs in a glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) phosphorylation-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanism of δ-catenin ubiquitination is still unknown. Here, we show that the lysine residues required for ubiquitination are located mainly in the C-terminal portion of δ-catenin. In addition, we provide evidence that β-TrCP-1 interacts with δ-catenin and functions as an E3 ligase, mediating δ-catenin ubiquitin–proteasome degradation. Furthermore, we prove that both the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway and the lysosome degradation pathway are involved in δ-catenin degradation. Our novel findings on the mechanism of δ-catenin ubiquitination will add a new perspective to δ-catenin degradation and the effects of δ-catenin on E-cadherin involved in epithelial cell–cell adhesion, which is implicated in prostate cancer progression.

Abstract: A number of diseases are caused by faulty function of the cardiac pacemaker and described as “sick sinus syndrome”. The medical treatment of sick sinus syndrome with electrical pacemaker implants in the diseased heart includes risks. These problems may be overcome via “biological pacemaker” derived from different adult cardiac cells or pluripotent stem cells. The generation of cardiac pacemaker cells requires the understanding of the pacing automaticity. Two characteristic phenomena the “membrane-clock” and the “Ca2+-clock” are responsible for the modulation of the pacemaker activity. Processes in the “membrane-clock” generating the spontaneous pacemaker firing are based on the voltage-sensitive membrane ion channel activity starting with slow diastolic depolarization and discharging in the action potential. The influence of the intracellular Ca2+ modulating the pacemaker activity is characterized by the “Ca2+-clock”. The generation of pacemaker cells started with the reprogramming of adult cardiac cells by targeted induction of one pacemaker function like HCN1–4 overexpression and enclosed in an activation of single pacemaker specific transcription factors. Reprogramming of adult cardiac cells with the transcription factor Tbx18 created cardiac cells with characteristic features of cardiac pacemaker cells. Another key transcription factor is Tbx3 specifically expressed in the cardiac conduction system including the sinoatrial node and sufficient for the induction of the cardiac pacemaker gene program. For a successful cell therapeutic practice, the generated cells should have all regulating mechanisms of cardiac pacemaker cells. Otherwise, the generated pacemaker cells serve only as investigating model for the fundamental research or as drug testing model for new antiarrhythmics.

Abstract: Heart and blood vessels ensure adequate perfusion of peripheral organs with blood and nutrients. Alteration of the homeostatic functions of the cardiovascular system can cause hypertension, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease leading to heart injury and failure. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) constitute a family of scaffolding proteins that are crucially involved in modulating the function of the cardiovascular system both under physiological and pathological conditions. AKAPs assemble multifunctional signaling complexes that ensure correct targeting of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) as well as other signaling enzymes to precise subcellular compartments. This allows local regulation of specific effector proteins that control the function of vascular and cardiac cells. This review will focus on recent advances illustrating the role of AKAPs in cardiovascular pathophysiology. The accent will be mainly placed on the molecular events linked to the control of vascular integrity and blood pressure as well as on the cardiac remodeling process associated with heart failure.

Abstract: In erythroid cells, more than 90% of transferrin-derived iron enters mitochondria where ferrochelatase inserts Fe2+ into protoporphyrin IX. However, the path of iron from endosomes to mitochondrial ferrochelatase remains elusive. The prevailing opinion is that, after its export from endosomes, the redox-active metal spreads into the cytosol and mysteriously finds its way into mitochondria through passive diffusion. In contrast, this study supports the hypothesis that the highly efficient transport of iron toward ferrochelatase in erythroid cells requires a direct interaction between transferrin-endosomes and mitochondria (the “kiss-and-run” hypothesis). Using a novel method (flow sub-cytometry), we analyze lysates of reticulocytes after labeling these organelles with different fluorophores. We have identified a double-labeled population definitively representing endosomes interacting with mitochondria, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy. Moreover, we conclude that this endosome-mitochondrion association is reversible, since a “chase” with unlabeled holotransferrin causes a time-dependent decrease in the size of the double-labeled population. Importantly, the dissociation of endosomes from mitochondria does not occur in the absence of holotransferrin. Additionally, mutated recombinant holotransferrin, that cannot release iron, significantly decreases the uptake of 59Fe by reticulocytes and diminishes 59Fe incorporation into heme. This suggests that endosomes, which are unable to provide iron to mitochondria, cause a “traffic jam” leading to decreased endocytosis of holotransferrin. Altogether, our results suggest that a molecular mechanism exists to coordinate the iron status of endosomal transferrin with its trafficking. Besides its contribution to the field of iron metabolism, this study provides evidence for a new intracellular trafficking pathway of organelles.

Abstract: Various toxic compounds produce reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative stress that threatens cellular homeostasis. Yet, lower doses of stress can stimulate defence systems allowing cell survival, whereas intense stress activates cell death pathways such as apoptosis. Mild thermal stress (40°C, 3h) induces thermotolerance, an adaptive survival response that renders cells less sensitive to subsequent toxic stress, by activating defence systems like heat shock proteins, antioxidants, anti-apoptotic and ER-stress factors. This study aims to understand how autophagy and apoptosis are regulated in response to different doses of H2O2, and whether mild thermotolerance can protect cervical carcinoma cells against apoptosis by stimulating autophagy. Autophagy was monitored through Beclin-1 and LC3 expression and acid compartment activity, whereas apoptosis was tracked by caspase activity and chromatin condensation. Exposure of HeLa and C33 A cells to H2O2 for shorter times (15–30min) transiently induced autophagy; apoptosis was activated after longer times (1−3h). Mild thermotolerance at 40°C enhanced activation of autophagy by H2O2. Disruption of autophagy using bafilomycin A1 and 3-methyladenine sensitised cells to apoptosis induced by H2O2, in non-thermotolerant cells and, to a lesser extent, in thermotolerant cells. Inhibition of autophagy enhanced apoptosis through the mitochondrial, death receptor and endoplasmic reticulum pathways. Autophagy was activated by lower doses of stress and protects cells against apoptosis induced by higher doses of H2O2. This work improves understanding of mechanisms that might be involved in toxicity of various compounds and could eventually lead to protective strategies against deleterious effects of toxic compounds.

Abstract: In a previous study, we reported that DNA damage induced apoptosis suppressor (DDIAS; hNoxin), a human homolog of mouse Noxin, functions as an anti-apoptotic protein in response to DNA repair. Here we reveal that DDIAS is a target gene of nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFATc1) and is associated with cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells. In the DDIAS promoter analysis, we found that NFATc1 activated the transcription of DDIAS through binding to NFAT consensus sequences in the DDIAS promoter. In addition, tissue array immunostaining revealed a correlation between DDIAS and NFATc1 expression in human lung tumors. NFATc1 knockdown or treatment with the NFAT inhibitor cyclosporine A induced apoptosis and led to growth inhibition of lung cancer cells, indicating the functional relevance of both the proteins. In contrast, DDIAS overexpression overcame this NFATc1 knockdown-induced growth inhibition, supporting the cancer-specific role of DDIAS as a target gene of NFATc1. NFATc1 or DDIAS inhibition clearly enhanced apoptosis induced by cisplatin in NCI-H1703 and A549 cells. Conversely, DDIAS overexpression rescued NCI-H1703 cells from cisplatin-mediated cell death and caspase-3/7 activation. These results suggest that NFATc1-induced DDIAS expression contributes to cisplatin resistance, and targeting DDIAS or NFATc1 impairs the mechanism regulating cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells. Taken together, DDIAS is a target of NFATc1 and is associated with cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells.

Abstract: The voltage dependent anion-selective channel, VDAC, is the major permeability pathway by which molecules and ion cross the mitochondrial outer membrane. This pathway has evolved to optimize the flow of these substances and to control this flow by a gating process that is influenced by a variety of factors including transmembrane voltage. The permeation pathway formed through the membrane by VDAC is complex. Small ion flow is primarily influenced by the charged surface of the inner walls of the channel. Channel closure changes this landscape resulting in a change from a channel that favors anions to one that favors cations. Molecular ions interact more intimately with the inner walls of the channel and are selected by their 3-dimensional structure, not merely by their size and charge. Molecular ions typically found in cells are greatly favored over those that are not. For these larger structures the channel may form a low-energy translocation path that complements the structure of the permeant.

Abstract: Integrins play key roles in the regulation of tumor cell adhesion, migration, invasion and sensitivity to anticancer drugs. In the present study we investigate the mechanism of resistance of tongue squamous carcinoma cells Cal27 with de novo integrin αvβ3 expression to anticancer drugs. Cal27-derived cell clones, obtained by transfection of plasmid containing integrin subunit β3 cDNA, as compared to control cells demonstrate: expression of integrin αvβ3; increased expression of integrin αvβ5; increased adhesion to fibronectin and vitronectin; resistance to cisplatin, mitomycin C, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil; increased migration and invasion, increased amount of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and decreased amounts of non-receptor tyrosine kinase (Src) and pSrc(Y418). Knockdown of ILK and integrin β5 in cells expressing integrin αvβ3 ruled out their involvement in drug resistance. Opposite, Src knockdown in Cal27 cells which led to a reduction in pSrc(Y418), as well as treatment with the pSrc(Y418) inhibitors dasatinib and PP2, conferred resistance to all four anticancer drugs, indicating that the loss of pSrc(Y418) is responsible for the observed effect. We identified differential integrin signaling between Cal27 and integrin αvβ3-expressing cells. In Cal27 cells integrin αv heterodimers signal through pSrc(Y418) while this is not the case in integrin αvβ3-expressing cells. Finally, we show that dasatinib counteracts the effect of cisplatin in two additional head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines Cal33 and Detroit562. Our results suggest that pSrc(Y418) inhibitors, potential drugs for cancer therapy, may reduce therapeutic efficacy if combined with chemotherapeutics, and might not be recommended for HNSCC treatment.

Abstract: Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) constitute a family of 14 members among which MCT1–4 facilitate the passive transport of monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate and ketone bodies together with protons across cell membranes. Their anchorage and activity at the plasma membrane requires interaction with chaperon protein such as basigin/CD147 and embigin/gp70. MCT1–4 are expressed in different tissues where they play important roles in physiological and pathological processes. This review focuses on the brain and on cancer. In the brain, MCTs control the delivery of lactate, produced by astrocytes, to neurons, where it is used as an oxidative fuel. Consequently, MCT dysfunctions are associated with pathologies of the central nervous system encompassing neurodegeneration and cognitive defects, epilepsy and metabolic disorders. In tumors, MCTs control the exchange of lactate and other monocarboxylates between glycolytic and oxidative cancer cells, between stromal and cancer cells and between glycolytic cells and endothelial cells. Lactate is not only a metabolic waste for glycolytic cells and a metabolic fuel for oxidative cells, but it also behaves as a signaling agent that promotes angiogenesis and as an immunosuppressive metabolite. Because MCTs gate the activities of lactate, drugs targeting these transporters have been developed that could constitute new anticancer treatments.

Ste20-like kinase, SLK, activates the heat shock factor 1 – Hsp70 pathway,

Abstract: Expression and activation of SLK increases during renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. When highly expressed, SLK signals via c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 to induce apoptosis, and it exacerbates apoptosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury. Overexpression of SLK in glomerular epithelial cells (GECs)/podocytes in vivo induces injury and proteinuria. In response to various stresses, cells enhance expression of chaperones or heat shock proteins (e.g. Hsp70), which are involved in the folding and maturation of newly synthesized proteins, and can refold denatured or misfolded proteins. We address the interaction of SLK with the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-Hsp70 pathway. Increased expression of SLK in GECs (following transfection) induced HSF1 transcriptional activity. Moreover, HSF1 transcriptional activity was increased by in vitro ischemia-reperfusion injury (chemical anoxia/recovery) and heat shock, and in both instances was amplified further by SLK overexpression. HSF1 binds to promoters of target genes, such as Hsp70 and induces their transcription. By analogy to HSF1, SLK stimulated Hsp70 expression. Hsp70 was also enhanced by anoxia/recovery and was further amplified by SLK overexpression. Induction of HSF1 and Hsp70 was dependent on the kinase activity of SLK, and was mediated via polo-like kinase-1. Transfection of constitutively active HSF1 enhanced Hsp70 expression and inhibited SLK-induced apoptosis. Conversely, the proapoptotic action of SLK was augmented by HSF1 shRNA, or the Hsp70 inhibitor, pifithrin-μ. In conclusion, increased expression/activity of SLK activates the HSF1-Hsp70 pathway. Hsp70 attenuates the primary proapoptotic effect of SLK. Modulation of chaperone expression may potentially be harnessed as cytoprotective therapy in renal cell injury.

Abstract: The immune system is a crucial player in tissue homeostasis and wound healing. A sophisticated cascade of events triggered upon injury ensures protection from infection and initiates and orchestrates healing. While the neonatal mammal can readily regenerate damaged tissues, adult regenerative capacity is limited to specific tissue types, and in organs such as the heart, adult wound healing results in fibrotic repair and loss of function. Growing evidence suggests that the immune system greatly influences the balance between regeneration and fibrotic repair. The neonate mammalian immune system has impaired pro-inflammatory function, is prone to T-helper type 2 responses and has an immature adaptive immune system skewed towards regulatory T cells. While these characteristics make infants susceptible to infection and prone to allergies, it may also provide an immunological environment permissive of regeneration. In this review we will give a comprehensive overview of the immune cells involved in healing and regeneration of the heart and explore differences between the adult and neonate immune system that may explain differences in regenerative ability.

Abstract: Exosomes mediate secretion of crystallin alphaB (cryAB), a well characterized molecular chaperone with anti-apoptotic activity. However, the mechanisms governing its packaging and secretion remained unexplored. In glioma cells, notwithstanding extensive phosphorylation of cryAB at Ser59 followed by Ser45 (Ser19 is largely unphosphorylated), we discovered that the majority of secreted exosomal cryAB is nonphosphorylated. Transient ectopic expression of a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) tagged triple phosphomimic (3-SD) cryAB construct in cryAB absent glioma cells led to the formation of large cytosolic inclusions. Our findings demonstrate that mimicking phosphorylation significantly reduces cryAB secretion via exosomes. Moreover, decreased colocalization of 3-SD YFP-cryAB with multivesicular endosome (MVE) and exosome marker, CD63 or Rab27, a small GTPase regulating exocytosis of MVEs, suggests that phosphorylation deters packaging of cryAB in vesicles bound for secretion as exosomes. Additionally, we found that preventing O-GlcNAcylation on cryAB also curtailed its colocalization with CD63 and Rab27 resulting in reduced exosomal secretion. Thus, our study points to O-GlcNAcylation and lack of phosphorylation as being the selective processes involved in the packaging and secretion of cryAB via exosomes.

Abstract: Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the phospholipid flippase ATP8B1. Apart from severe cholestatic liver disease, many PFIC1 patients develop extrahepatic symptoms characteristic of cystic fibrosis (CF), such as pulmonary infection, sweat gland dysfunction and failure to thrive. CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel essential for epithelial fluid transport. Previously it was shown that CFTR transcript levels were strongly reduced in livers of PFIC1 patients. Here we have investigated the hypothesis that ATP8B1 is important for proper CFTR expression and function. We analyzed CFTR expression in ATP8B1-depleted intestinal and pulmonary epithelial cell lines and assessed CFTR function by measuring short-circuit currents across transwell-grown ATP8B1-depleted intestinal T84 cells and by a genetically-encoded fluorescent chloride sensor. In addition, we studied CFTR surface expression upon induction of CFTR transcription. We show that CFTR protein levels are strongly reduced in the apical membrane of human ATP8B1-depleted intestinal and pulmonary epithelial cell lines, a phenotype that coincided with reduced CFTR activity. Apical membrane insertion upon induction of ectopically-expressed CFTR was strongly impaired in ATP8B1-depleted cells. We conclude that ATP8B1 is essential for correct apical localization of CFTR in human intestinal and pulmonary epithelial cells, and that impaired CFTR localization underlies some of the extrahepatic phenotypes observed in ATP8B1 deficiency.

Abstract: Sensitivity of FRET in hetero- and homo-FRET systems on the photoselected orientation distribution of donors has been proven by using polarized and depolarized light for excitation. FRET as well as donor and acceptor anisotropies have been simultaneously measured in a dual emission–polarization scheme realized in a conventional flow cytometer by using single laser excitation and applying fluorophore-conjugated mAbs against the MHCI and MHCII cell surface receptors. Depolarization of the originally polarized light have been achieved by using crystal depolarizers based on Cornu's principle, a quarter-wave plate for circular polarization, and a parallel beam splitter acting as a diagonal-polarizer for dual-polarization excitation. Simultaneous analysis of intensity-based FRET efficiency and acceptor depolarization equivocally report that depolarization of light may increase FRET in an amount depending on the acceptor-to-donor concentration ratio. Acceptor depolarization turned to be more sensitive to FRET than donor hyper-polarization and even than intensity-based FRET efficiency. It can be used as a sensitive tool for monitoring changes in the dynamics of the donor–acceptor pairs. The basic observations of FRET enhancement and increased acceptor depolarization obtained for hetero-FRET are paralleled by analog observations of homo-FRET enhancements under depolarized excitation. In terms of the orientation factor for FRET, the FRET enhancements on depolarization in the condition of the macroscopically isotropic orientation distributions such as those of the cell surface bound fluorophores report on the presence of local orientation mismatches of the donor and acceptor preventing the optimal FRET in the polarized case, which may be eliminated by the excitation depolarization. A theory of fluorescence anisotropy for depolarized excitation is also presented.

Abstract: The cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain. The complex accepts electrons from cytochrome c and passes them onto molecular oxygen. This process contributes to energy capture in the form of a membrane potential across the inner membrane. The enzyme complex assembles in a stepwise process from the three mitochondria-encoded core subunits Cox1, Cox2 and Cox3, which associate with nuclear-encoded subunits and cofactors. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cytochrome c oxidase associates with the bc1-complex into supercomplexes, allowing efficient energy transduction. Here we report on Cox26 as a protein found in respiratory chain supercomplexes containing cytochrome c oxidase. Our analyses reveal Cox26 as a novel stoichiometric structural subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase. A loss of Cox26 affects cytochrome c oxidase activity and respirasome organization.

Integrin-mediated transactivation of P2X7R via hemichannel-dependent ATP release stimulates astrocyte migration,

Abstract: Our previous reports indicate that ligand-induced αVβ3 integrin and Syndecan-4 engagement increases focal adhesion formation and migration of astrocytes. Additionally, ligated integrins trigger ATP release through unknown mechanisms, activating P2X7 receptors (P2X7R), and the uptake of Ca2+ to promote cell adhesion. However, whether the activation of P2X7R and ATP release are required for astrocyte migration and whether αVβ3 integrin and Syndecan-4 receptors communicate with P2X7R via ATP remains unknown. Here, cells were stimulated with Thy-1, a reported αVβ3 integrin and Syndecan-4 ligand. Results obtained indicate that ATP was released by Thy-1 upon integrin engagement and required the participation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase-C gamma (PLCγ) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3R). IP3R activation leads to increased intracellular Ca2+, hemichannel (Connexin-43 and Pannexin-1) opening, and ATP release. Moreover, silencing of the P2X7R or addition of hemichannel blockers precluded Thy-1-induced astrocyte migration. Finally, Thy-1 lacking the integrin-binding site did not stimulate ATP release, whereas Thy-1 mutated in the Syndecan-4-binding domain increased ATP release, albeit to a lesser extent and with delayed kinetics compared to wild-type Thy-1. Thus, hemichannels activated downstream of an αVβ3 integrin-PI3K-PLCγ-IP3R pathway are responsible for Thy-1-induced, hemichannel-mediated and Syndecan-4-modulated ATP release that transactivates P2X7Rs to induce Ca2+ entry. These findings uncover a hitherto unrecognized role for hemichannels in the regulation of astrocyte migration via P2X7R transactivation induced by integrin-mediated ATP release.

Abstract: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (Hog1 in yeast and ortholog p38 in human cells) plays a critical role in the signal transduction pathway that is rapidly activated under multiple stress conditions. Environmental stress stimuli such as hyperosmotic stress cause changes in cellular ATP metabolism required for hyperosmotic stress tolerance. Furthermore, hyperosmotic stress induces rapid Ca2+ signals in eukaryotic cells. These Ca2+ signals can be decoded by Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM). By using genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that Hog1 is a novel CaM-binding protein, and that CaM-binding to Hog1 is involved in the mediation of the hyperosmotic stress signaling pathway. In addition, we show that p38α, a human ortholog of Hog1, interacts with CaM, suggesting that the CaM-binding feature of Hog1/p38α is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotic cells. Hog1 is likely involved in cellular ATP regulation through CaM signaling during hyperosmotic stress. Therefore, this work suggests that Hog1 plays an important role in connecting CaM signaling with the hyperosmotic stress pathway by directly interacting with CaM in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
