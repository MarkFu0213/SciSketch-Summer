Abstract: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a movement and posture disorder that affects over 50 million people worldwide. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hUC-MSC) transplantation has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy for CP. The administration route appears to be crucial for hUC-MSC to provide adequate neuroprotection. Wistar rats were given hypoxia-ischemia to make the CP model on postnatal day 5. On postnatal day 21, DiR-labeled hUC-MSC were transplanted into the CP rats by intravenous, intrathecal, and lateral ventricle for cell tracking. Uninfused CP rats served as the negative control. The motor behavioral and pathological alteration was analyzed 11, 25, and 39 days after transplantation to assess motor function, immune inflammation, neurotrophy, and endogenous repair. In vivo imaging tracking techniques revealed that intravenous infusion resulted in fewer transplanted cells in the target brain than intrathecal and lateral ventricle infusion (p＜0.05). Three different routes of hUC-MSC infusion improved the motor function of CP rats (p＜0.05). At 11 days post-infusion, intrathecal infusion outperformed intravenous with a significant neurotrophic and oligodendrocyte maturation effect (p＜0.05). Intrathecal infusion equaled lateral ventricle infusion after 25 days. At 39 days post-infusion, lateral ventricle infusion exceeded intravenous and intrathecal infusion with a significant immunosuppressive effect (p＜0.05). Considering the improved effect and less trauma shown early in the intrathecal infusion, repeated intrathecal administration may ultimately lead to the greatest benefit.

Abstract: Summary
Following activation by cognate antigen, B cells undergo fine-tuning of their antigen receptors and may ultimately differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). While antigen-specific B cells that express surface receptors (B cell receptors [BCRs]) can be readily cloned and sequenced following flow sorting, antigen-specific ASCs that lack surface BCRs cannot be easily profiled. Here, we report an approach, TRAPnSeq (antigen specificity mapping through immunoglobulin [Ig] secretion TRAP and Sequencing), that allows capture of secreted antibodies on the surface of ASCs, which in turn enables high-throughput screening of single ASCs against large antigen panels. This approach incorporates flow cytometry, standard microfluidic platforms, and DNA-barcoding technologies to characterize antigen-specific ASCs through single-cell V(D)J, RNA, and antigen barcode sequencing. We show the utility of TRAPnSeq by profiling antigen-specific IgG and IgE ASCs from both mice and humans and highlight its capacity to accelerate therapeutic antibody discovery from ASCs.

Abstract: The prognosis of patients with relapsed and/or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) continues to be poor. Therefore, there is a continuing need to develop novel therapies and to rationalize the use of target combinations. In recent years there has been growing interest in epigenetic targets for hematological malignancies under the rationale of the presence of common alterations in epigenetic transcriptional regulation. Since Hodgkin and Reed–Sternberg (HRS) cells have frequent inactivating mutations of the CREBBP and EP300 acetyltransferases, bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors can be a rational therapy for cHL. Here we aimed to confirm the efficacy of BET inhibitors (iBETs) using representative cell models and functional experiments, and to further explore biological mechanisms under iBET treatment using whole-transcriptome analyses. Our results reveal cytostatic rather than cytotoxic activity through the induction of G1/S and G2/M cell-cycle arrest, in addition to variable MYC downregulation. Additionally, massive changes in the transcriptome induced by the treatment include downregulation of relevant pathways in cHL disease: NF-kB and E2F, among others. Our findings support the therapeutic use of iBETs in selected cHL patients and reveal previously unknown biological mechanisms and consequences of pan-BET inhibition.

Abstract: Casein kinase 2 alpha 1 (CSNK2A1) is a known oncogene, but its role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) remain undefined. Here, we investigated the effects of CSNK2A1 during CRC development. In the current study, CSNK2A1 expression in the colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW480, HT29, SW620 and Lovo) vs. normal colorectal cell line (CCD841 CoN) were compared via RT-qPCR and western blotting. The role of CSNK2A1 on CRC growth and metastases were investigated through Transwell assay. Immunofluorescence analysis was used to investigate the expression of EMT-related proteins. The association between P300/H3K27ac and CSNK2A1 were analyzed using UCSC bioinformatics and Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (Ch-IP) assays. Results revealed that both the mRNA and protein levels of CSNK2A1 in HCT116, SW480, HT29, SW620 and Lovo cells were upregulated. Additionally, P300-mediated H3K27ac activation at the CSNK2A1 promoter was found to drive the increase in CSNK2A1 expression. Transwell assay showed that CSNK2A1 overexpression increased the migration and invasion of HCT116 and SW480 cells, which decreased following CSNK2A1 silencing. CSNK2A1 was also found to facilitate EMT in HCT116 cells, evidenced by the increases of N-cadherin, Snail and Vimentin expression, and loss of E-cadherin. Importantly, the levels of p-AKT-S473/AKT, p-AKT-T308/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR in cells overexpressing CSNK2A1 were high, but significantly decreased following CSNK2A silencing. The PI3K inhibitor BAY-806946 could reverse the increase in p-AKT-S473/AKT, p-AKT-T308/AKT, p-mTOR/mTOR induced by CSNK2A1 overexpression and suppress CRC cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, we report a positive feedback mechanism through which P300 enhances CSNK2A1 expression and accelerates CRC progression through the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis.

Abstract: Summary
O-linked N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) is a ubiquitous and dynamic non-canonical glycosylation of intracellular proteins. Several branches of metabolism converge at the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) to produce the substrate for protein O-GlcNAcylation, the uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). Availability of UDP-GlcNAc is considered a key regulator of O-GlcNAcylation. Yet UDP-GlcNAc concentrations are rarely reported in studies exploring the HBP and O-GlcNAcylation, most likely because the methods to measure it are restricted to specialized chromatographic procedures. Here, we introduce an enzymatic method to quantify cellular and tissue UDP-GlcNAc. The method is based on O-GlcNAcylation of a substrate peptide by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) and subsequent immunodetection of the modification. The assay can be performed in dot-blot or microplate format. We apply it to quantify UDP-GlcNAc concentrations in several mouse tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, we show how changes in UDP-GlcNAc levels correlate with O-GlcNAcylation and the expression of OGT and O-GlcNAcase (OGA).

Abstract: Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of EGFR-positive patients exhibiting a T790 M resistance mutation after treatment with an earlier generation of EGFR TKIs. However, resistance to osimertinib inevitably develops despite its efficacy, and the resistance mechanisms are complex and not fully understood. We established cell lines with acquired resistance to osimertinib from gefitinib- or erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells using a dose-escalation method, and found that they had upregulated levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2. Targeted next-generation sequencing of 143 genes was performed, and interestingly, amplification of KRAS was observed in osimertinib-resistant cells. Transfection of siRNA against the KRAS gene notably reduced the activation of ERK1/2 and AKT and significantly enhanced the induction of apoptosis by osimertinib treatment in osimertinib-resistant cells. LY3009120, a RAF inhibitor, showed a significant synergistic effect with osimertinib on apoptotic cell death in osimertinib-resistant cells. Combined treatment with osimertinib and LY3009120 also demonstrated remarkable synergistic anti-tumor activity in mouse xenografts of these cells. This could be a potential new treatment option for KRAS amplification-induced osimertinib failure.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 infection and mRNA vaccination both elicit spike (S)-specific T cell responses. To analyze how T cell memory from prior infection influences T cell responses to vaccination, we evaluated functional T cell responses in naive and previously infected vaccine recipients. Pre-vaccine S-specific responses are predictive of subsequent CD8+ T cell vaccine-response magnitudes. Comparing baseline with post-vaccination TCRβ repertoires, we observed large clonotypic expansions correlated with the frequency of spike-specific T cells. Epitope mapping the largest CD8+ T cell responses confirms that an HLA-A∗03:01 epitope was highly immunodominant. Peptide-MHC tetramer staining together with mass cytometry and single-cell sequencing permit detailed phenotyping and clonotypic tracking of these S-specific CD8+ T cells. Our results demonstrate that infection-induced S-specific CD8+ T cell memory plays a significant role in shaping the magnitude and clonal composition of the circulating T cell repertoire after vaccination, with mRNA vaccination promoting CD8+ memory T cells to a TEMRA-like phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Moderate inflammation is essential for standard wound healing. In pathological conditions, such as diabetes, protracted and refractory wounds are associated with excessive inflammation, manifested by persistent proinflammatory macrophage states. However, the mechanisms are still unclear. Herein, we perform a metabolomic profile and find a significant phenylpyruvate accumulation in diabetic foot ulcers. Increased phenylpyruvate impairs wound healing and augments inflammatory responses, whereas reducing phenylpyruvate via dietary phenylalanine restriction relieves uncontrolled inflammation and benefits diabetic wounds. Mechanistically, phenylpyruvate is ingested into macrophages in a scavenger receptor CD36-dependent manner, binds to PPT1, and inhibits depalmitoylase activity, thus increasing palmitoylation of the NLRP3 protein. Increased NLRP3 palmitoylation is found to enhance NLRP3 protein stability, decrease lysosome degradation, and promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the release of inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, finally triggering the proinflammatory macrophage phenotype. Our study suggests a potential strategy of targeting phenylpyruvate to prevent excessive inflammation in diabetic wounds.

Abstract: Summary
Brain functions are accomplished by polysynaptic circuits formed by neurons wired together through multiple orders of synaptic connections. Polysynaptic connectivity has been difficult to examine due to a lack of methods of continuously tracing the pathways in a controlled manner. Here, we demonstrate directed, stepwise retrograde polysynaptic tracing by inducible reconstitution of replication-deficient trans-neuronal pseudorabies virus (PRVΔIE) in the brain. Furthermore, PRVΔIE replication can be temporally restricted to minimize its neurotoxicity. With this tool, we delineate a wiring diagram between the hippocampus and striatum—two major brain systems for learning, memory, and navigation—that consists of projections from specific hippocampal domains to specific striatal areas via distinct intermediate brain regions. Therefore, this inducible PRVΔIE system provides a tool for dissecting polysynaptic circuits underlying complex brain functions.

Abstract: Summary
Type I diabetes (T1D) impairs bone accrual in patients, but the mechanism is unclear. Here in a murine monogenic model for T1D, we demonstrate that diabetes suppresses bone formation resulting in a rapid loss of both cortical and trabecular bone. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovers metabolic dysregulation in bone marrow osteogenic cells of diabetic mice. In vivo stable isotope tracing reveals impaired glycolysis in diabetic bone that is highly responsive to insulin stimulation. Remarkably, deletion of the insulin receptor reduces cortical but not trabecular bone. Increasing glucose uptake by overexpressing Glut1 in osteoblasts exacerbates bone defects in T1D mice. Conversely, activation of glycolysis by Pfkfb3 overexpression preserves both trabecular and cortical bone mass in the face of diabetes. The study identifies defective glucose metabolism in osteoblasts as a pathogenic mechanism for osteopenia in T1D, and furthermore implicates boosting osteoblast glycolysis as a potential bone anabolic therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Proteinaceous cysteines function as essential sensors of cellular redox state. Consequently, defining the cysteine redoxome is a key challenge for functional proteomic studies. While proteome-wide inventories of cysteine oxidation state are readily achieved using established, widely adopted proteomic methods such as OxICAT, Biotin Switch, and SP3-Rox, these methods typically assay bulk proteomes and therefore fail to capture protein localization-dependent oxidative modifications. Here we establish the local cysteine capture (Cys-LoC) and local cysteine oxidation (Cys-LOx) methods, which together yield compartment-specific cysteine capture and quantitation of cysteine oxidation state. Benchmarking of the Cys-LoC method across a panel of subcellular compartments revealed more than 3,500 cysteines not previously captured by whole-cell proteomic analysis. Application of the Cys-LOx method to LPS-stimulated immortalized murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDM), revealed previously unidentified, mitochondrially localized cysteine oxidative modifications upon pro-inflammatory activation, including those associated with oxidative mitochondrial metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections pose a significant health burden. Using pre-fusion conformation fusion (F) proteins, we isolated a panel of anti-F antibodies from a human donor. One antibody (RSV-199) potently cross-neutralized 8 RSV and hMPV strains by recognizing antigenic site III, which is partially conserved in RSV and hMPV F. Next, we determined the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of RSV-199 bound to RSV F trimers, hMPV F monomers, and an unexpected dimeric form of hMPV F. These structures revealed how RSV-199 engages both RSV and hMPV F proteins through conserved interactions of the antibody heavy-chain variable region and how variability within heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) can be accommodated at the F protein interface in site-III-directed antibodies. Furthermore, RSV-199 offered enhanced protection against RSV A and B strains and hMPV in cotton rats. These findings highlight the mechanisms of broad neutralization and therapeutic potential of RSV-199.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin resistance (IR) is the root cause of type II diabetes, yet no safe treatment is available to address it. Using a high throughput compatible assay that measures real-time translocation of the glucose transporter glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), we identified small molecules that potentiate insulin action. In vivo, these insulin sensitizers improve insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, glucose tolerance, and glucose uptake in a model of IR. Using proteomic and CRISPR-based approaches, we identified the targets of those compounds as Unc119 proteins and solved the structure of Unc119 bound to the insulin sensitizer. This study identifies compounds that have the potential to be developed into diabetes treatment and establishes Unc119 proteins as targets for improving insulin sensitivity.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is one of the recognized malignant tumors of female reproductive system. At present, the research and development of biomarkers has attracted increasing attention, and the wide application of clinical cervical cancer screening strategies has significantly reduced its morbidity and mortality. A member of the F-box protein family, FBXO22, is involved in cell cycle, DNA damage repair and many other processes. Dysregulation of FBXO22 plays an important role in the occurrence and development of various tumors, including ovarian cancer, liver cancer and lung cancer. Nevertheless, the effect of FBXO22 in cervical cancer needs further investigation. We found that FBXO22 inhibited cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The results of proteomics studies suggested FBXO22 appears to target the Cyclin G Associated Kinase (GAK) for degradation. The combined results of analysis of cultured cells with altered abundance of FBXO22 by depletion or over-expression in the presence or absence of proteasomal inhibitor, comparison of protein decay rate, as well as cellular ubiquitination, support a hypothesis that FBXO22 mediates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of GAK. Taken together, our data suggest that FBXO22 has a protective role in cervical cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) neurons in the brainstem regulate the ventilatory response to hypercarbia. It is unclear how PHOX2B-polyalanine repeat mutations (PHOX2B-PARMs) alter the function of PHOX2B and perturb the formation of RTN neurons. Here, we generated human brainstem organoids (HBSOs) with RTN-like neurons from human pluripotent stem cells. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that expression of PHOX2B+7Ala PARM alters the differentiation trajectories of the hindbrain neurons and hampers the formation of the RTN-like neurons in HBSOs. With the unguided cerebral organoids (HCOs), PHOX2B+7Ala PARM interrupted the patterning of PHOX2B+ neurons with dysregulation of Hedgehog pathway and HOX genes. With complementary use of HBSOs and HCOs with a patient and two mutant induced pluripotent stem cell lines carrying different polyalanine repetition in PHOX2B, we further defined the association between the length of polyalanine repetition and malformation of RTN-respiratory center and demonstrated the potential toxic gain of function of PHOX2B-PARMs, highlighting the uniqueness of these organoid models for disease modeling.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic macrophages represent a key cellular component of the liver and are essential for the progression of acute liver failure (ALF). We construct artificial apoptotic cells loaded with itaconic acid (AI-Cells), wherein the compositions of the synthetic plasma membrane and surface topology are rationally engineered. AI-Cells are predominantly localized to the liver and further transport to hepatic macrophages. Intravenous administration of AI-Cells modulates macrophage inflammation to protect the liver from acetaminophen-induced ALF. Mechanistically, AI-Cells act on caspase-1 to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form in macrophages. Notably, AI-Cells specifically induce anti-inflammatory memory-like hepatic macrophages in ALF mice, which prevent constitutive overproduction of IL-1β when liver reinjury occurs. In light of AI-Cells’ precise delivery and training of memory-like hepatic macrophages, they offer promising therapeutic potential in reversing ALF by finely controlling inflammatory responses and orchestrating liver homeostasis, which potentially affect the treatment of various types of liver failure.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical stress can modulate the fate of cells in both physiological and extreme conditions. Recurrence of tumors after thermal ablation, a radical therapy for many cancers, indicates that some tumor cells can endure temperatures far beyond physiological ones. This unusual heat resistance with unknown mechanisms remains a key obstacle to fully realizing the clinical potential of thermal ablation. By developing a 3D bioprinting-based thermal ablation system, we demonstrate that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in this 3D model exhibit enhanced heat resistance as compared with cells on plates. Mechanistically, the activation of transcription factor SP1 under mechanical confinement enhances the transcription of Interleukin-4-Induced-1, which catalyzes tryptophan metabolites to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), leading to heat resistance. Encouragingly, the AHR inhibitor prevents HCC recurrence after thermal ablation. These findings reveal a previously unknown role of mechanical confinement in heat resistance and provide a rationale for AHR inhibitors as neoadjuvant therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in older adults. Investigating shared genetic components between metabolites and AMD can enhance our understanding of its pathogenesis. We conduct metabolite genome-wide association studies (mGWASs) using multi-ethnic genetic and metabolomic data from up to 28,000 participants. With bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis involving 16,144 advanced AMD cases and 17,832 controls, we identify 108 putatively causal relationships between plasma metabolites and advanced AMD. These metabolites are enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, lysophospholipid, triradylcglycerol, and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid pathways. Bayesian genetic colocalization analysis and a customized metabolome-wide association approach prioritize putative causal AMD-associated metabolites. We find limited evidence linking urine metabolites to AMD risk. Our study emphasizes the contribution of plasma metabolites, particularly lipid-related pathways and genes, to AMD risk and uncovers numerous putative causal associations between metabolites and AMD risk.

Abstract: Summary
Direct targeting of essential viral enzymes such as proteases, polymerases, and helicases has long been the major focus of antiviral drug design. Although successful for some viral enzymes, targeting viral helicases is notoriously difficult to achieve, demanding alternative strategies. Here, we show that the NS3 helicase of Zika virus (ZIKV) undergoes acetylation in its RNA-binding tunnel. Regulation of the acetylated state of K389 in ZIKV NS3 modulates RNA binding and unwinding and is required for efficient viral replication. NS3 acetylation is mediated by a specific isoform of the host acetyltransferase KAT5 (KAT5γ), which translocates from the nucleus to viral replication complexes upon infection. NS3 acetylation by KAT5γ and its proviral role are also conserved in West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and yellow fever virus (YFV). Our study provides molecular insight into how a cellular acetyltransferase regulates viral helicase functions, unveiling a previously unknown target for antiviral drug development.

Abstract: Intestinal epithelial cell differentiation is a highly controlled and orderly process occurring in the crypt so that cells migrating out to cover the villi are already fully functional. Absorptive cell precursors, which originate from the stem cell population located in the lower third of the crypt, are subject to several cycles of amplification in the transit amplifying (TA) zone, before reaching the terminal differentiation compartment located in the upper third. There is a large body of evidence that absorptive cell differentiation is halted in the TA zone through various epigenetic, transcriptional and intracellular signalling events or mechanisms allowing the transient expansion of this cell population but how these mechanisms are themself regulated remains obscure. One clue can be found in the epithelial cell-matrix microenvironment located all along the crypt-villus axis. Indeed, a previous study from our group revealed that α5-subunit containing laminins such as lamimin-511 and 512 inhibit early stages of differentiation in Caco-2/15 cells. Among potential receptors for laminin 511/512 is the integrin α7β1, which has previously been reported to be expressed in the human intestinal crypts and in early stages of Caco-2/15 cell differentiation. In this study, the effects of knocking down ITGA7 in Caco-2/15 cells were studied using shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 strategies. Abolition of the α7 integrin subunit resulted in a significant increase in the level of differentiation and polarization markers as well as the morphological features of intestinal cells. Activities of focal adhesion kinase and Src kinase were both reduced in α7-knockdown cells while the three major intestinal pro-differentiation factors CDX2, HNFα1 and HNF4α were overexpressed. Two epigenetic events associated with intestinal differentiation, the reduction of tri-methylated lysine 27 on histone H3 and the increase of acetylation of histone H4 were also observed in α7-knockdown cells. On the other hand, the ablation of α7 had no effect on cell proliferation. In conclusion, these data indicate that integrin α7β1 acts as a major repressor of absorptive cell terminal differentiation in the Caco-2/15 cell model and suggest that the laminin-α7β1 integrin interaction occurring in the transit amplifying zone of the adult intestine is involved in the transient halting of absorptive cell terminal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare but aggressive skin cancer, remains a challenge in the era of precision medicine. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the only approved therapy for advanced MCC, are impeded by high primary and acquired resistance. Hence, we dissect transcriptomic heterogeneity at single-cell resolution in a panel of patient tumors, revealing phenotypic plasticity in a subset of treatment-naive MCC. The tumor cells in a “mesenchymal-like” state are endowed with an inflamed phenotype that portends a better ICI response. This observation is also validated in the largest whole transcriptomic dataset available from MCC patient tumors. In contrast, ICI-resistant tumors predominantly express neuroepithelial markers in a well-differentiated state with “immune-cold” landscape. Importantly, a subtle shift to “mesenchymal-like” state reverts copanlisib resistance in primary MCC cells, highlighting potential strategies in patient stratification for therapeutics to harness tumor cell plasticity, augment treatment efficacy, and avert resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Blood-based correlates of vaccine-induced protection against tuberculosis (TB) are urgently needed. Here, we analyze the blood transcriptome of rhesus macaques immunized with varying doses of intravenous (i.v.) BCG followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) challenge. We use high-dose i.v. BCG recipients for “discovery” and validate our findings in low-dose recipients and in an independent cohort of macaques receiving BCG via different routes. We identify seven vaccine-induced gene modules, including an innate module (module 1) enriched for type 1 interferon and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways. Module 1 on day 2 post-vaccination highly correlates with lung antigen-responsive CD4 T cells at week 8 and with Mtb and granuloma burden following challenge. Parsimonious signatures within module 1 at day 2 post-vaccination predict protection following challenge with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) ≥0.91. Together, these results indicate that the early innate transcriptional response to i.v. BCG in peripheral blood may provide a robust correlate of protection against TB.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal networks on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) provide a unique phenotyping tool to study neurological disorders. However, it is difficult to infer cellular mechanisms underlying these phenotypes. Computational modeling can utilize the rich dataset generated by MEAs, and advance understanding of disease mechanisms. However, existing models lack biophysical detail, or validation and calibration to relevant experimental data. We developed a biophysical in silico model that accurately simulates healthy neuronal networks on MEAs. To demonstrate the potential of our model, we studied neuronal networks derived from a Dravet syndrome (DS) patient with a missense mutation in SCN1A, encoding sodium channel NaV1.1. Our in silico model revealed that sodium channel dysfunctions were insufficient to replicate the in vitro DS phenotype, and predicted decreased slow afterhyperpolarization and synaptic strengths. We verified these changes in DS patient-derived neurons, demonstrating the utility of our in silico model to predict disease mechanisms.

Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology, affecting more and more women of reproductive age. Our study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism and effect of exosomal miR-4449 on granulosa cells (GCs). Two immortalized human ovarian granulosa cells (KGN and COV434 cells) were used for in vitro functional studies. Our study found that follicular fluid (FF) derived exosomal miR-4449 was significantly decreased in women with PCOS compared with the control patients. And exosomal miR-4449 could alleviate GCs oxidative stress (OS) and promote GCs proliferation, while the opposite trend was observed after inhibiting the expression of miR-4449. In addition, we demonstrated that Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1(KEAP1) was a direct target of miR-4449 through dual-luciferase reporter assay, and the expression patterns of KEAP1 and miR-4449 in PCOS FF-derived exosomes were exactly opposite. In addition, KEAP1/NRF2 signaling pathway may play an important role in GCs proliferation and OS. Our results demonstrated that the decreased FF-derived exosomal miR-4449 expression in PCOS might aggravate the OS of GCs and inhibit GCs proliferation via KEAP1/NRF2 signaling pathway. Exosomal miR-4449 might be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of PCOS. Our study contributes to a new understanding of the pathogenesis of PCOS.

Abstract: Summary
Engineering synthetic heterotrophy is a key to the efficient bio-based valorization of renewable and waste substrates. Among these, engineering hemicellulosic pentose utilization has been well-explored in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) over several decades—yet the answer to what makes their utilization inherently recalcitrant remains elusive. Through implementation of a semi-synthetic regulon, we find that harmonizing cellular and engineering objectives are a key to obtaining highest growth rates and yields with minimal metabolic engineering effort. Concurrently, results indicate that “extrinsic” factors—specifically, upstream genes that direct flux of pentoses into central carbon metabolism—are rate-limiting. We also reveal that yeast metabolism is innately highly adaptable to rapid growth on non-native substrates and that systems metabolic engineering (i.e., functional genomics, network modeling, etc.) is largely unnecessary. Overall, this work provides an alternate, novel, holistic (and yet minimalistic) approach based on integrating non-native metabolic genes with a native regulon system.

Abstract: Summary
Pregnant women in resource-limited settings are highly susceptible to anemia and iron deficiency, but the etiology of postpartum anemia remains poorly defined. To inform the optimal timing for anemia interventions, changes in iron deficiency-attributable anemia through pregnancy and postpartum need to be understood. In 699 pregnant Papua New Guinean women attending their first antenatal care appointment and following up at birth and 6 and 12 months postpartum, we undertake logistic mixed-effects modeling to determine the effect of iron deficiency on anemia and population attributable fractions, calculated from odds ratios, to quantify the contribution of iron deficiency to anemia. Anemia is highly prevalent during pregnancy and 12 months postpartum, with iron deficiency increasing the odds of anemia during pregnancy and, to a lesser extent, postpartum. Iron deficiency accounts for ≥72% of anemia during pregnancy and 20%–37% postpartum. Early iron supplementation during and between pregnancies could break the cycle of chronic anemia in women of reproductive age.

Abstract: Summary
Protein glycosylation influences cellular recognition and regulates protein interactions, but how glycosylation functions alongside other common posttranslational modifications (PTMs), like tyrosine sulfation (sTyr), is unclear. We produced a library of 53 chemoenzymatically synthesized glycosulfopeptides representing N-terminal domains of human and murine P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), varying in sTyr and O-glycosylation (structure and site). Using these, we identified key roles of PSGL-1 O-glycosylation and sTyr in controlling interactions with specific chemokines. Results demonstrate that sTyr positively affects CCL19 and CCL21 binding to PSGL-1 N terminus, whereas O-glycan branching and sialylation reduced binding. For murine PSGL-1, interference between PTMs is greater, attributed to proximity between the two PTMs. Using fluorescence polarization, we found sTyr is a positive determinant for some chemokines. We showed that synthetic sulfopeptides are potent in decreasing chemotaxis of human dendritic cells toward CCL19 and CCL21. Our results provide new research avenues into the interplay of PTMs regulating leukocyte/chemokine interactions.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in disease progression and is a key determinant of therapeutic response in cancer patients. Here, we propose a noninvasive approach to predict the TME status from radiological images by combining radiomics and deep learning analyses. Using multi-institution cohorts of 2,686 patients with gastric cancer, we show that the radiological model accurately predicted the TME status and is an independent prognostic factor beyond clinicopathologic variables. The model further predicts the benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with localized disease. In patients treated with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, the model predicts clinical response and further improves predictive accuracy when combined with existing biomarkers. Our approach enables noninvasive assessment of the TME, which opens the door for longitudinal monitoring and tracking response to cancer therapy. Given the routine use of radiologic imaging in oncology, our approach can be extended to many other solid tumor types.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (hiPSC) cardiomyocytes are a promising source for regenerative therapy. To realize this therapy, however, their engraftment potential after their injection into the host heart should be improved. Here, we established an efficient method to analyze the cell cycle activity of hiPSC cardiomyocytes using a fluorescence ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) system. In vitro high-throughput screening using FUCCI identified a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonist, Am80, as an effective cell cycle activator in hiPSC cardiomyocytes. The transplantation of hiPSC cardiomyocytes treated with Am80 before the injection significantly enhanced the engraftment in damaged mouse heart for 6 months. Finally, we revealed that the activation of endogenous Wnt pathways through both RARA and RARB underlies the Am80-mediated cell cycle activation. Collectively, this study highlights an efficient method to activate cell cycle in hiPSC cardiomyocytes by Am80 as a means to increase the graft size after cell transplantation into a damaged heart.

Abstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a type of steatosis not associated with excessive alcohol intake and includes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to advanced fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Mitochondrial dysfunction causes oxidative stress, triggering hepatocyte death and inflammation; therefore, the present study aimed to explore relationship between mitochondrial carriers and oxidative stress. Firstly, we established a high fat diet (HFD)-fed ICR mouse NAFLD model characterized by obesity with insulin resistance and found transcriptional upregulation of Slc25a17 and downregulation of Slc25a3 (isoform B) and Slc25a13 in their fatty liver. A mitochondrial phosphate and Cu carrier, SLC25A3, was further studied in wild-type (wt) and SLC25A3-defective HepG2 cells (C1 and C3). SLC25A3 deficiency had insignificant effect on mitochondrial membrane potential (MtMP) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in untreated cells but suppressed them when cells were exposed to oleic acid. C1 and C3 cells were prone to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased ROS was associated with reduced mRNA expression of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 1 and glutathione disulfide reductase (GSX) in these cell lines. Interestingly, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Cu accumulation significantly reduced in C1 cells, demonstrating a predominant contribution of SLC25A3 to Cu transport into mitochondrial matrix. Cytotoxicity of free fatty acids was unchanged between wt and SLC25A3-deficient cells. These results indicate that reduced expression of SLC25A3 in fatty liver contributes to electron leak from mitochondria by limiting Cu availability, rendering hepatocytes more susceptible to oxidative stress. This study provides evidence that SLC25A3 is a novel risk factor for developing NASH.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has seen a worldwide expansion in incidence in the past three decades. Tumor-derived exosomes have been associated with the metastasis of cancer cells and are present within the local hypoxic tumor microenvironment, where they mediate intercellular communication by transferring molecules including microRNAs (miRNAs) between cells. Although miRNAs have been shown to serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, the role of hypoxia-induced tumor-derived exosomes in PTC progression remains unclear. Herein, we investigated the differentially expressed miRNA expression profiles from GEO datasets (GSE191117 and GSE151180) by using the DESeq package in R and identified a novel role for miR-221-3p as an oncogene in PTC development. In vivo and in vitro loss and gain assays were used to clarify the mechanism of hypoxic PTC cells derived exosomal-miR-221-3p in PTC. miR-221-3p was upregulated in human PTC plasma exosomes, tissues and cell lines. We found that hypoxic PTC cells derived exosomal-miR-221-3p promoted normoxic PTC cells proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro, while inhibition of miR-221-3p limited PTC tumor growth in our PTC xenograft model in nude mice. We ﬁnally identiﬁed ZFAND5, to be a miR-221-3p target. Mechanistically, hypoxic PTC cell lines-derived exosomes carrying miR-221-3p promoted PTC tumorigenesis by regulating ZFAND5. Our findings further the understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with PTC progression and identify exosomal-miR-221-3p as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of PTC patients. Our study also suggests that miR-221-3p inhibitors could be a potential treatment strategy for PTC.

Abstract: Summary
Insufficient sleep impairs glucose regulation, increasing the risk of diabetes. However, what it is about the human sleeping brain that regulates blood sugar remains unknown. In an examination of over 600 humans, we demonstrate that the coupling of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep spindles and slow oscillations the night before is associated with improved next-day peripheral glucose control. We further show that this sleep-associated glucose pathway may influence glycemic status through altered insulin sensitivity, rather than through altered pancreatic beta cell function. Moreover, we replicate these associations in an independent dataset of over 1,900 adults. Of therapeutic significance, the coupling between slow oscillations and spindles was the most significant sleep predictor of next-day fasting glucose, even more so than traditional sleep markers, relevant to the possibility of an electroencephalogram (EEG) index of hyperglycemia. Taken together, these findings describe a sleeping-brain-body framework of optimal human glucose homeostasis, offering a potential prognostic sleep signature of glycemic control.

Abstract: Summary
The Gabija complex is a prokaryotic antiviral system consisting of the GajA and GajB proteins. GajA was identified as a DNA nicking endonuclease but the functions of GajB and the complex remain unknown. Here, we show that synergy between GajA-mediated DNA cleavage and nucleotide hydrolysis by GajB initiates efficient abortive infection defense against virulent bacteriophages. The antiviral activity of GajA requires GajB, which senses DNA termini produced by GajA to hydrolyze (d)A/(d)GTP, depleting essential nucleotides. This ATPase activity of Gabija complex is only activated upon DNA binding. GajA binds to GajB to form stable complexes in vivo and in vitro. However, a functional Gabija complex requires a molecular ratio between GajB and GajA below 1:1, indicating stoichiometric regulation of the DNA/nucleotide processing complex. Thus, the Gabija system exhibits distinct and efficient antiviral defense through sequential sensing and activation of nucleotide depletion and DNA cleavage, causing a cascade suicide effect.

Abstract: Summary
Fast and low-dose reconstructions of medical images are highly desired in clinical routines. We propose a hybrid deep-learning and iterative reconstruction (hybrid DL-IR) framework and apply it for fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fast positron emission tomography (PET), and low-dose computed tomography (CT) image generation tasks. First, in a retrospective MRI study (6,066 cases), we demonstrate its capability of handling 3- to 10-fold under-sampled MR data, enabling organ-level coverage with only 10- to 100-s scan time; second, a low-dose CT study (142 cases) shows that our framework can successfully alleviate the noise and streak artifacts in scans performed with only 10% radiation dose (0.61 mGy); and last, a fast whole-body PET study (131 cases) allows us to faithfully reconstruct tumor-induced lesions, including small ones (<4 mm), from 2- to 4-fold-accelerated PET acquisition (30–60 s/bp). This study offers a promising avenue for accurate and high-quality image reconstruction with broad clinical value.

Abstract: Summary
Digital health data used in diagnostics, patient care, and oncology research continue to accumulate exponentially. Most medical information, and particularly radiology results, are stored in free-text format, and the potential of these data remains untapped. In this study, a radiological repomics-driven model incorporating medical token cognition (RadioLOGIC) is proposed to extract repomics (report omics) features from unstructured electronic health records and to assess human health and predict pathological outcome via transfer learning. The average accuracy and F1-weighted score for the extraction of repomics features using RadioLOGIC are 0.934 and 0.934, respectively, and 0.906 and 0.903 for the prediction of breast imaging-reporting and data system scores. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the prediction of pathological outcome without and with transfer learning are 0.912 and 0.945, respectively. RadioLOGIC outperforms cohort models in the capability to extract features and also reveals promise for checking clinical diagnoses directly from electronic health records.

Abstract: In cancer, cell migration contributes to the spread of tumor cells resulting in metastasis. Heterogeneity in the migration capacity can produce individual cells with heightened capacity leading to invasion and metastasis. Our hypothesis is that cell migration characteristics can divide asymmetrically in mitosis, allowing a subset of cells to have a larger contribution to invasion and metastasis. Therefore, our aim is to elucidate whether sister cells have different migratory capacity and analyze if this difference is defined by mitosis. Through time-lapse videos, we analyzed migration speed, directionality, maximum displacement of each trajectory, and velocity as well as cell area and polarity and then compared the values between mother-daughter cells and between sister cells of three tumor cell lines (A172, MCF7, SCC25) and two normal cell lines (MRC5 and CHO·K1 cells). We observed that daughter cells had a different migratory phenotype compared to their mothers, and one single mitosis is enough for the sisters behave like nonrelated cells. However, mitosis did not influence cell area and polarity dynamics. These findings indicates that migration performance is not heritable, and that asymmetric cell division might have an important impact on cancer invasion and metastasis, by producing cells with different migratory capacity.

Abstract: Exposure of eukaryotic cells to ionizing radiation or clastogenic chemicals leads to formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). These lesions are also generated internally by chemicals and enzymes, in the absence of exogenous agents, though the sources and consequences of such endogenously generated DSBs remain poorly understood. In the current study, we have investigated the impact of reduced recombinational repair of endogenous DSBs on stress responses, cell morphology and other physical properties of S. cerevisiae (budding yeast) cells. Use of phase contrast and DAPI-based fluorescence microscopy combined with FACS analysis confirmed that recombination-deficient rad52 cell cultures exhibit chronically high levels of G2 phase cells. Cell cycle phase transit times during G1, S and M were similar in WT and rad52 cells, but the length of G2 phase was increased by three-fold in the mutants. rad52 cells were larger than WT in all phases of the cycle and displayed other quantifiable changes in physical characteristics. The high G2 cell phenotype was abolished when DNA damage checkpoint genes, but not spindle assembly checkpoint genes, were co-inactivated with RAD52. Several other RAD52 group mutants (rad51, rad54, rad55, rad57 and rad59) also exhibited the high G2 cell phenotype. The results indicate that recombination deficiency leads to accumulation of unrepaired DSBs during normal mitotic growth that activate a major stress response and produce distinct changes in cellular physiology and morphology.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-based editing has revolutionized genome engineering despite the observation that many DNA sequences remain challenging to target. Unproductive interactions formed between the single guide RNA’s (sgRNA) Cas9-binding scaffold domain and DNA-binding antisense domain are often responsible for such limited editing resolution. To bypass this limitation, we develop a functional SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) approach, termed BLADE (binding and ligand activated directed evolution), to identify numerous, diverse sgRNA variants that bind Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 and support DNA cleavage. These variants demonstrate surprising malleability in sgRNA sequence. We also observe that particular variants partner more effectively with specific DNA-binding antisense domains, yielding combinations with enhanced editing efficiencies at various target sites. Using molecular evolution, CRISPR-based systems could be created to efficiently edit even challenging DNA sequences making the genome more tractable to engineering. This selection approach will be valuable for generating sgRNAs with a range of useful activities.

Abstract: Summary
Rising drug resistance among pathogenic fungi, paired with a limited antifungal arsenal, poses an increasing threat to human health. To identify antifungal compounds, we screened the RIKEN natural product depository against representative isolates of four major human fungal pathogens. This screen identified NPD6433, a triazenyl indole with broad-spectrum activity against all screening strains, as well as the filamentous mold Aspergillus fumigatus. Mechanistic studies indicated that NPD6433 targets the enoyl reductase domain of fatty acid synthase 1 (Fas1), covalently inhibiting its flavin mononucleotide-dependent NADPH-oxidation activity and arresting essential fatty acid biosynthesis. Robust Fas1 inhibition kills Candida albicans, while sublethal inhibition impairs diverse virulence traits. At well-tolerated exposures, NPD6433 extended the lifespan of nematodes infected with azole-resistant C. albicans. Overall, identification of NPD6433 provides a tool with which to explore lipid homeostasis as a therapeutic target in pathogenic fungi and reveals a mechanism by which Fas1 function can be inhibited.

Abstract: IRF1 is a tumor suppressor gene in colon cancer. This study aimed to explore the potential regulation of IRF1 on the ferroptosis of colon cancer and the mechanisms underlying its regulation of GPX4 transcription. IRF1 interacting transcription factors regulating GPX4 transcription were predicted and validated. The role of the IRF1/SPI1-GPX4 axis on the ferroptosis of colon cancer cells was explored. Results showed that IRF1 overexpression reduced GPX4 transcription, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid ROS accumulation, and enhanced erastin-induced colon cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. SPI1 could directly bind to the GPX4 promoter (−414 to −409) and activate its transcription. IRF1 could bind to SPI1 and suppress its transcriptional activating effects on GPX4 expression. SPI1 overexpression reduced ROS and lipid ROS accumulation and increased colon cancer cell viability and colony formation upon erastin induction. These trends were reversed by IRF1 overexpression. In conclusion, this study revealed a novel oncogenic mechanism of SPI1 by reducing erastin-induced ferroptosis in colon cancer. IRF1 interacts with SPI1 and suppresses its transcriptional activating effect on GPX4 expression. Through this mechanism, IRF1 can enhance erastin-induced ferroptosis of colon cancer. The IRF1/SPI1-GPX4 axis might play a crucial role in modulating ferroptosis in colon cancer and might serve as a potential therapeutic target in the future.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of biomarkers that predict viral rebound after discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) would significantly contribute to the HIV cure field. We previously initiated ART in 20 rhesus macaques on days 0, 1, 2, and 3 following SIVmac251 infection. After 6 months, we discontinued ART and observed viral rebound in 9 of 20 animals, which provided an opportunity to define peripheral biomarkers on ART that predicted viral rebound following ART discontinuation. We show that interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6_JAK_STAT3, IL-10, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), IL-22, and IL-23 signaling and activation of monocyte, macrophage, and antigen processing and presentation pathways during ART suppression correlated with viral rebound. These signatures were validated in a second cohort of macaques. Our data suggest that low levels of antigen and proinflammatory signaling during ART suppression correlate with the presence of a rebound-competent viral reservoir. Interventions that modulate these peripheral biomarkers may be promising candidates to evaluate as potential HIV-1 cure strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Automated home-cage monitoring systems present a valuable tool for comprehensive phenotyping of natural behaviors. However, current systems often involve complex training routines, water or food restriction, and probe a limited range of behaviors. Here, we present a fully automated home-cage monitoring system for cognitive and behavioral phenotyping in mice. The system incorporates T-maze alternation, novel object recognition, and object-in-place recognition tests combined with monitoring of locomotion, drinking, and quiescence patterns, all carried out over long periods. Mice learn the tasks rapidly without any need for water or food restrictions. Behavioral characterization employs a deep convolutional neural network image analysis. We show that combined statistical properties of multiple behaviors can be used to discriminate between mice with hippocampal, medial entorhinal, and sham lesions and predict the genotype of an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model with high accuracy. This technology may enable large-scale behavioral screening for genes and neural circuits underlying spatial memory and other cognitive processes.

Abstract: Oxidative stress is one of the most important factors in changing bone homeostasis. Redox homeostasis plays a key role in the osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the angiogenesis ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) for bone regeneration. Currently, this study assessed the effects of punicalagin (PUN) on BMSCs and HUVECs. Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay. A flow cytometry analysis was adopted to detect macrophage polarization. The production of reactive oxygen stress (ROS), glutathione (GSH), malonaldehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were evaluated by using commercially-available kits. Osteogenic capacity of BMSCs was evaluated by ALP activity, ALP staining and ARS staining. The expression of osteogenic-related proteins (OCN, Runx-2, OPN) and Nrf/HO-1 levles were evaluated by Western blotting. Osteogenic-related genes (Osterix, COL-1, BMP-4, ALP) were evaluated by RT-PCR. Migration ability and invasion ability of HUVECs were evaluated by wound healing assay and Transwell assay. Angiogenic ability was detected by tube formation assay and the expression of angiogenic-related genes (VEGF, vWF, CD31) were evaluated by RT-PCR. Results showed that PUN alleviated oxidative stress by TNF-α, enhanced osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs and angiogenesis in HUVECs. Moreover, PUN regulate immune microenvironment by promoting the polarization of M2 macrophages and reduce the oxidative stress related products by activating Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Altogether, these results suggested that PUN can promote osteogenic capacity of BMSCs, angiogenesis of HUVECs, alleviate oxidative stress via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, offering PUN as a novel antioxidant agent for treating bone loss diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming is known as an emerging mechanism of chemotherapy resistance, but the metabolic signatures of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) remain unclear. Here, we characterize the metabolomic profile of PDAC organoids and classify them into glucomet-PDAC (high glucose metabolism levels) and lipomet-PDAC (high lipid metabolism levels). Glucomet-PDACs are more resistant to chemotherapy than lipomet-PDACs, and patients with glucomet-PDAC have a worse prognosis. Integrated analyses reveal that the GLUT1/aldolase B (ALDOB)/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) axis induces chemotherapy resistance by remodeling glucose metabolism in glucomet-PDAC. Increased glycolytic flux, G6PD activity, and pyrimidine biosynthesis are identified in glucomet-PDAC with high GLUT1 and low ALDOB expression, and these phenotypes could be reversed by inhibiting GLUT1 expression or by increasing ALDOB expression. Pharmacological inhibition of GLUT1 or G6PD enhances the chemotherapy response of glucomet-PDAC. Our findings uncover potential metabolic heterogeneity related to differences in chemotherapy sensitivity in PDAC and develop a promising pharmacological strategy for patients with chemotherapy-resistant glucomet-PDAC through the combination of chemotherapy and GLUT1/ALDOB/G6PD axis inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
The historically dominant SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant and the currently dominant Omicron variants carry a T492I substitution within the non-structural protein 4 (NSP4). Based on in silico analyses, we hypothesized that the T492I mutation increases viral transmissibility and adaptability, which we confirmed with competition experiments in hamster and human airway tissue culture models. Furthermore, we showed that the T492I mutation increases the replication capacity and infectiveness of the virus and improves its ability to evade host immune responses. Mechanistically, the T492I mutation increases the cleavage efficiency of the viral main protease NSP5 by enhancing enzyme-substrate binding, which increases production of nearly all non-structural proteins processed by NSP5. Importantly, the T492I mutation suppresses viral-RNA-associated chemokine production in monocytic macrophages, which may contribute to the attenuated pathogenicity of Omicron variants. Our results highlight the importance of NSP4 adaptation in the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Summary
The multi-step degradation process of PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) poses a challenge for their rational development, as the rate-limiting steps that determine PROTACs efficiency remain largely unknown. Moreover, the slow throughput of currently used endpoint assays does not allow the comprehensive analysis of larger series of PROTACs. Here, we developed cell-based assays using the NanoLuciferase and HaloTag that allow measuring PROTAC-induced degradation and ternary complex formation kinetics and stability in cells. Using PROTACs developed for the degradation of WD40 repeat domain protein 5 (WDR5), the characterization of the mode of action of these PROTACs in the early degradation cascade revealed a key role of ternary complex formation and stability. Comparing a series of ternary complex crystal structures highlighted the importance of an efficient E3-target interface for ternary complex stability. The developed assays outline a strategy for the rational optimization of PROTACs using a series of live cell assays monitoring key steps of the early PROTAC-induced degradation pathway.

Abstract: Summary
DNA-encoded libraries (DELs) provide unmatched chemical diversity and starting points for novel drug modalities. Here, we describe a workflow that exploits the bifunctional attributes of DEL ligands as a platform to generate BRET probes for live cell target engagement studies. To establish proof of concept, we performed a DEL screen using aurora kinase A and successfully converted aurora DEL ligands as cell-active BRET probes. Aurora BRET probes enabled the validation and stratification of the chemical series identified from primary selection data. Furthermore, we have evaluated the effective repurposing of pre-existing DEL screen data to find suitable leads for BRET probe development. Our findings support the use of DEL workflows as an engine to create cell-active BRET probes independent of structure or compound SAR. The combination of DEL and BRET technology accelerates hit-to-lead studies in a live cell setting.

Abstract: Summary
A characteristic clinical complication in cancer patients is the frequent incidence of thrombotic events. Numerous studies have shown hyperactive/activated platelets to be a critical earlier trigger for cancer-associated thrombus formation. However, there currently is no viable approach to monitor specific changes in tumor-associated platelet activity. Here, we describe a chromatograph-like microfluidic device that is highly sensitive to the activity status of peripheral circulating platelets in both tumor-bearing mice and clinical cancer patients. Our results show a strongly positive correlation between platelet activation status and tumor progression. Six-month follow-up data from advanced cancer patients reveal positive links between platelet activity level and thrombus occurrence rate, with a high predictive capacity of thrombotic events (AUC = 0.842). Our findings suggest that circulating platelet activity status determined by this microfluidic device exhibits sensitive, predictive potential for thrombotic events in cancer patients for directing well-timed antithrombosis treatment.

Abstract: Summary
In this work, we propose an approach to generate whole-slide image (WSI) tiles by using deep generative models infused with matched gene expression profiles. First, we train a variational autoencoder (VAE) that learns a latent, lower-dimensional representation of multi-tissue gene expression profiles. Then, we use this representation to infuse generative adversarial networks (GANs) that generate lung and brain cortex tissue tiles, resulting in a new model that we call RNA-GAN. Tiles generated by RNA-GAN were preferred by expert pathologists compared with tiles generated using traditional GANs, and in addition, RNA-GAN needs fewer training epochs to generate high-quality tiles. Finally, RNA-GAN was able to generalize to gene expression profiles outside of the training set, showing imputation capabilities. A web-based quiz is available for users to play a game distinguishing real and synthetic tiles: https://rna-gan.stanford.edu/, and the code for RNA-GAN is available here: https://github.com/gevaertlab/RNA-GAN.

Abstract: Summary
Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) is a significant complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT), but major factors determining disease severity are not well defined yet. By combining multiplexed tissue imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing on gastrointestinal biopsies from aHSCT-treated individuals with fecal microbiome analysis, we link high microbiome diversity and the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria to the sustenance of suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, aGvHD severity strongly associates with the clonal expansion of mainly CD8 T cells, which we find distributed over anatomically distant regions of the gut, persistent over time, and inversely correlated with the presence of suppressive Tregs. Overall, our study highlights the pathophysiological importance of expanded CD8 T cell clones in the progression of aGvHD toward more severe clinical manifestations and strongly supports the further development of microbiome interventions as GvHD treatment via repopulation of the gut Treg niche to suppress inflammation.

Abstract: ORP5 is a transmembrane protein anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum, which mainly functions as a lipid transporter and has reportedly been linked to cancer. However, the specific mechanism of ORP5 action in cervical cancer (CC) is unclear. In this study, we found that ORP5 promotes the migration and invasive ability of CC cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ORP5 expression was linked to endoplasmic reticulum stress, and ORP5 encouraged CC metastasis by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress. Mechanistically, ORP5 inhibited endoplasmic reticulum stress in CC cells by stimulating ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of SREBP1 to reduce its expression. In conclusion, ORP5 promotes the malignant progression of CC by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress, providing a therapeutic target and strategy for CC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
We present TopicFlow, a computational framework for flow cytometry data analysis of patient blood samples for the identification of functional and dynamic topics in circulating T cell population. This framework applies a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, adapting the concept of topic modeling in text mining to flow cytometry. To demonstrate the utility of our method, we conducted an analysis of ∼17 million T cells collected from 138 peripheral blood samples in 51 patients with melanoma undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Our study highlights three latent dynamic topics identified by LDA: a T cell exhaustion topic that independently recapitulates the previously identified LAG-3+ immunotype associated with ICI resistance, a naive topic and its association with immune-related toxicity, and a T cell activation topic that emerges upon ICI treatment. Our approach can be broadly applied to mine high-parameter flow cytometry data for insights into mechanisms of treatment response and toxicity.

Abstract: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a form of idiopathic vasculitis frequently accompanied by coronary artery lesions, which involves endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies have demonstrated that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are implicated in many cardiovascular diseases. However, few studies have examined the role of circRNAs on endothelial dysfunction in KD. In this study, we investigated the role of circ7632 on endothelial–mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) in KD and then explored the underlying mechanism. Children diagnosed with KD and age-matched healthy controls (HC) were included. Sera samples were collected. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained and incubated with 15% HC and KD serum for 48 h. The mRNA and protein expression of mesenchymal markers vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and endothelial marker zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in HUVECs transfected with plasmid-circ7632 and si-circ7632 were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. CCK8, scratch test, and migration test were performed to examine the effect of circ7632 on the cell proliferation and migration. The circ7632 level was higher in HUVECs treated by KD serum than in HUVECs treated with HC serum. Overexpression of circ7632 significantly increased vimentin and α-SMA expression, decreased ZO-1 expression, and also decreased cell proliferation. Down-regulation of circ7632 expression got the opposite results. RNA-seq analysis, and confirmatory experiment displayed that down-regulation of circ7632 decreased IL-33 expression, and IL-33 silencing mitigated KD serum-mediated EndoMT. Our study revealed that circ7632 level was elevated in KD serum-treated HUVECs. Circ7632 down-regulation could alleviate EndoMT likely through decreasing IL-33 expression. The circ7632 may become a potential therapeutic target for KD.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying virus-host interactions on the cell surface can improve our understanding of viral entry and pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 disease, uses ACE2 as a receptor to enter cells. Yet the full repertoire of cell surface proteins that contribute to viral entry is unknown. We developed a photocatalyst-based viral-host protein microenvironment mapping platform (ViraMap) to probe the molecular neighborhood of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the human cell surface. Application of ViraMap to ACE2-expressing cells captured ACE2, the established co-receptor NRP1, and several novel cell surface proteins. We systematically analyzed the relevance of these candidate proteins to SARS-CoV-2 entry by knockdown and overexpression approaches in pseudovirus and authentic infection models and identified PTGFRN and EFNB1 as bona fide viral entry factors. Our results highlight additional host targets that participate in SARS-CoV-2 infection and showcase ViraMap as a powerful platform for defining viral interactions on the cell surface.

Abstract: Summary
Optimization of cell engineering protocols requires standard, comprehensive quality metrics. We previously developed CellNet, a computational tool to quantitatively assess the transcriptional fidelity of engineered cells compared with their natural counterparts, based on bulk-derived expression profiles. However, this platform and others were limited in their ability to compare data from different sources, and no current tool makes it easy to compare new protocols with existing state-of-the-art protocols in a standardized manner. Here, we utilized our prior application of the top-scoring pair transformation to build a computational platform, platform-agnostic CellNet (PACNet), to address both shortcomings. To demonstrate the utility of PACNet, we applied it to thousands of samples from over 100 studies that describe dozens of protocols designed to produce seven distinct cell types. We performed an in-depth examination of hepatocyte and cardiomyocyte protocols to identify the best-performing methods, characterize the extent of intra-protocol and inter-lab variation, and identify common off-target signatures, including a surprising neural/neuroendocrine signature in primary liver-derived organoids. We have made PACNet available as an easy-to-use web application, allowing users to assess their protocols relative to our database of reference engineered samples, and as open-source, extensible code.

Abstract: Summary
Determining the prognostic association of different immune cell types in the tumor microenvironment is critical for understanding cancer biology and developing new therapeutic strategies. However, this is challenging in certain cancer types, where the abundance of different immune subsets is highly correlated. In this study, we develop a computational method named TimiGP to overcome this challenge. Based on bulk gene expression and survival data, TimiGP infers cell-cell interactions that reveal the association between immune cell relative abundance and prognosis. As demonstrated in metastatic melanoma, TimiGP prioritizes immune cells critical in prognosis based on the identified cell-cell interactions. Highly consistent results are obtained by TimiGP when applied to seven independent melanoma datasets and when different cell-type marker sets are used as inputs. Additionally, TimiGP can leverage single-cell RNA sequencing data to delineate the tumor immune microenvironment at high resolutions across a wide range of cancer types.

Abstract: Summary
Direct diagnosis and accurate assessment of metabolic syndrome (MetS) allow for prompt clinical interventions. However, traditional diagnostic strategies overlook the complex heterogeneity of MetS. Here, we perform metabolomic analysis in 13,554 participants from the natural cohort and identify 26 hub plasma metabolic fingerprints (PMFs) associated with MetS and its early identification (pre-MetS). By leveraging machine-learning algorithms, we develop robust diagnostic models for pre-MetS and MetS with convincing performance through independent validation. We utilize these PMFs to assess the relative contributions of the four major MetS risk factors in the general population, ranked as follows: hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Furthermore, we devise a personalized three-dimensional plasma metabolic risk (PMR) stratification, revealing three distinct risk patterns. In summary, our study offers effective screening tools for identifying pre-MetS and MetS patients in the general community, while defining the heterogeneous risk stratification of metabolic phenotypes in real-world settings.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) guarantee the continuous supply of all blood lineages during life. In response to stress, HSCs are capable of extensive proliferative expansion, whereas in steady state, HSCs largely remain in a quiescent state to prevent their exhaustion. DNA replication is a very complex process, where many factors need to exert their functions in a perfectly concerted manner. Mini-chromosome-maintenance protein 10 (Mcm10) is an important replication factor, required for proper assembly of the eukaryotic replication fork. In this report, we use zebrafish to study the role of mcm10 during embryonic development, and we show that mcm10 specifically regulates HSC emergence from the hemogenic endothelium. We demonstrate that mcm10-deficient embryos present an accumulation of DNA damages in nascent HSCs, inducing their apoptosis. This phenotype can be rescued by knocking down p53. Taken all together, our results show that mcm10 plays an important role in the emergence of definitive hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is the 5th most common cancer over the world. Ubiquitin protease 43 (UBP43) is a multifunctional protein with deubiquitinase activities. Abnormal expression of UBP43 has been reported in numerous types of malignancies. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes (Fold change ≥2 or ≤ −2 and p < 0.01) in GC from the datasets downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis databases, which showed that UBP43 and stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) were up-regulated in both datasets. Online databases displayed the binding of UBP43 to STIP1 and the positive correlation between the two proteins. This study aims to explore: the role of UBP43 in cell proliferation and apoptosis in GC; the relationship between UBP43 and STIP1; and whether UBP43 exerts its function via STIP1 in GC. Knockdown/overexpression stable GC cell lines were generated by transducing lentivirus carrying coding sequence/short hairpin RNA of UBP43 and puromycin selection. GC patients with higher expressions of UBP43 had poor prognosis. Loss-/gain-of-function experiments revealed that pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic abilities of UBP43 in GC cells and xenografts. UBP43 could interact with STIP1, inhibit its ubiquitination, and promote its protein stability, thereby enhancing STIP1 expression. Moreover, STIP1 knockdown reversed the pro-proliferative ability of UBP43 in GC cells. Our study uncovers that the pro-proliferative role of UBP43 in GC development is STIP1-dependent and indicates that UBP43 may act as a potent therapeutic target in GC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
We report a case of fulminant fatal neonatal listeriosis due to horizontal transmission of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) in a neonatal double room. Genomic analyses reveal a close genetic relationship between clinical isolates, supporting cross-contamination. Oral inoculation experiments in adult and neonatal mice show that neonates are susceptible to a low Lm inoculum and that this susceptibility results from the immaturity of the neonatal gut microbiota. Infected neonates should therefore be isolated for as long as they shed Lm in their feces to avoid horizontal transmission and its dire consequences.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrences frequently occur following surgical removal of primary tumors. In many cancers, adjuvant therapies have limited efficacy. Surgery provides access to the tumor microenvironment, creating an opportunity for local therapy, in particular immunotherapy, which can induce local and systemic anti-cancer effects. Here, we develop a surgically optimized biodegradable hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel for sustained intraoperative delivery of Toll-like receptor 3 agonist poly(I:C) and demonstrate that it significantly reduces tumor recurrence after surgery in multiple mouse models. Mechanistically, poly(I:C) induces a transient interferon alpha (IFNα) response, reshaping the tumor/wound microenvironment by attracting inflammatory monocytes and depleting regulatory T cells. We demonstrate that a pre-existing IFN signature predicts response to the poly(I:C) hydrogel, which sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint therapy. The safety, immunogenicity, and surgical feasibility are confirmed in a veterinary trial in canine soft tissue tumors. The surgically optimized poly(I:C)-loaded hydrogel provides a safe and effective approach to prevent cancer recurrence.

Abstract: Summary
The immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 plays critical roles in both immune system homeostasis and tumor progression. Impaired PD-1/PD-L1 function promotes autoimmunity and PD-L1 expression within tumors promotes immune evasion. If and how changes in metabolism or defined metabolites regulate PD-L1 expression is not fully understood. Here, using a metabolomics activity screening-based approach, we have determined that hydroxyproline (Hyp) significantly and directly enhances adaptive (i.e., IFN-γ-induced) PD-L1 expression in multiple relevant myeloid and cancer cell types. Mechanistic studies reveal that Hyp acts as an inhibitor of autophagic flux, which allows it to regulate this negative feedback mechanism, thereby contributing to its overall effect on PD-L1 expression. Due to its prevalence in fibrotic tumors, these findings suggest that hydroxyproline could contribute to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and that Hyp metabolism could be targeted to pharmacologically control PD-L1 expression for the treatment of cancer or autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is frequently and highly expressed in various human malignancies and protects cancer cells against apoptosis induced by multifarious stresses, particularly endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). The inhibition of GRP78 expression or activity could enhance apoptosis induced by anti-tumor drugs or compounds. Herein, we will evaluate the efficacy of lysionotin in the treatment of human liver cancer as well as the molecular mechanism. Moreover, we will examine whether inhibition of GRP78 enhanced the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to lysionotin. We found that lysionotin significantly suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of liver cancer cells. TEM showed that lysionotin-treated liver cancer cells showed an extensively distended and dilated endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Meanwhile, the levels of the ER stress hallmark GRP78 and UPR hallmarks (e.g., IRE1α and CHOP) were significantly increased in response to lysionotin treatment in liver cancer cells. Moreover, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger NAC and caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO visibly attenuated the induction of GRP78 and attenuated the decrease in cell viability induced by lysionotin. More importantly, the knockdown of GRP78 expression by siRNAs or treatment with EGCG, both induced remarkable increase in lysionotin-induced PARP and pro-caspase-3 cleavage and JNK phosphorylation. In addition, knockdown of GRP78 expression by siRNA or suppression GRP78 activity by EGCG both significantly improved the effectiveness of lysionotin. These data indicated that pro-survival GRP78 induction may contribute to lysionotin resistance. The combination of EGCG and lysionotin is suggested to represent a novel approach in cancer chemo-prevention and therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Over the last several years, a method has emerged that endows adult hepatocytes with in vitro proliferative capacity, producing chemically induced liver progenitors (CLiPs). However, there is a growing controversy regarding the origin of these cells. Here, we provide lineage tracing-based evidence that adult hepatocytes acquire proliferative capacity in vitro using rat and mouse models. Unexpectedly, we also found that the CLiP method allows biliary epithelial cells to acquire extensive proliferative capacity. Interestingly, after long-term culture, hepatocyte-derived cells (hepCLiPs) and biliary epithelial cell-derived cells (bilCLiPs) become similar in their gene expression patterns, and they both exhibit differentiation capacity to form hepatocyte-like cells. Finally, we provide evidence that hepCLiPs can repopulate injured mouse livers, reinforcing our earlier argument that CLiPs can be a cell source for liver regenerative medicine. This study advances our understanding of the origin of CLiPs and motivates the application of this technique in liver regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Human gliogenesis remains poorly understood, and derivation of astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is inefficient and cumbersome. Here, we report controlled glial differentiation from hPSCs that bypasses neurogenesis, which otherwise precedes astrogliogenesis during brain development and in vitro differentiation. hPSCs were first differentiated into radial glial cells (RGCs) resembling resident RGCs of the fetal telencephalon, and modulation of specific cell signaling pathways resulted in direct and stepwise induction of key astroglial markers (NFIA, NFIB, SOX9, CD44, S100B, glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]). Transcriptomic and genome-wide epigenetic mapping and single-cell analysis confirmed RGC-to-astrocyte differentiation, obviating neurogenesis and the gliogenic switch. Detailed molecular and cellular characterization experiments uncovered new mechanisms and markers for human RGCs and astrocytes. In summary, establishment of a glia-exclusive neural lineage progression model serves as a unique serum-free platform of manufacturing large numbers of RGCs and astrocytes for neuroscience, disease modeling (e.g., Alexander disease), and regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Satellite cells are indispensable for skeletal muscle regeneration and hypertrophy by forming nascent myofibers (myotubes). They synthesize multi-potent modulator netrins (secreted subtypes: netrin-1, -3, and -4), originally found as classical neural axon guidance molecules. While netrin-1 and -3 have key roles in myogenic differentiation, the physiological significance of netrin-4 is still unclear. This study examined whether netrin-4 regulates myofiber type commitment and myotube formation. Initially, the expression profiles indicated that satellite cells isolated from the extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL muscle: fast-twitch myofiber-abundant) expressed slightly more netrin-4 than the soleus muscle (slow-type abundant) cells. As netrin-4 knockdown inhibited both slow- and fast-type myotube formation, netrin-4 may not directly regulate myofiber type commitment. However, netrin-4 knockdown in satellite cell-derived myoblasts reduced the myotube fusion index, while exogenous netrin-4 promoted myotube formation, even though netrin-4 expression level was maximum during the initiation stage of myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, netrin-4 knockdown also inhibited MyoD (a master transcriptional factor of myogenesis) and Myomixer (a myoblast fusogenic molecule) expression. These data suggest that satellite cells synthesize netrin-4 during myogenic differentiation initiation to promote their own fusion, stimulating the MyoD–Myomixer signaling axis.

Abstract: Summary
Wearable biosensors and smartphone applications can measure physiological variables over multiple days in free-living conditions. We measure food and drink ingestion, glucose dynamics, physical activity, heart rate (HR), and heart rate variability (HRV) in 25 healthy participants over 14 days. We develop a Bayesian inference framework to learn personal parameters that quantify circadian rhythms and physiological responses to external stressors. Modeling the effects of ingestion events on glucose levels reveals that slower glucose decay kinetics elicit larger postprandial glucose spikes, and we uncover a circadian baseline rhythm for glucose with high amplitudes in some individuals. Physical activity and circadian rhythms explain as much as 40%–65% of the HR variance, whereas the variance explained for HRV is more heterogeneous across individuals. A more complex model incorporating activity, HR, and HRV explains up to 15% of additional glucose variability, highlighting the relevance of integrating multiple biosensors to better predict glucose dynamics.

Abstract: Background
The ability of cancer cells to be invasive and metastasize depend on several factors, of which the action of protease activity takes center stage in disease progression.
Purpose/objective
To analyze function of new K21 molecule in the invasive process of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line.
Materials & methods
The Fusobacterium (ATCC 23726) streaks were made, and pellets were resuspended in Cal27 (ATCC CRL-2095) OSCC cell line spheroid cell microplate. Cells were seeded and Lysotracker staining performed for CathepsinK red channel. Cell and morphology were evaluated using Transmission Electron microscopy. Thiobarbituric acid assay was performed. OSCC was analyzed for Mic60. Raman spectra were collected from the cancer cell line. L929 dermal fibroblast cells were used for Scratch Assay. ELISA muti arrays were used for cytokines and matrix molecules. Internalization ability of fibroblast cells were also analyzed. Structure of K21 as a surfactant molecule with best docked poses were presented.
Results
Decrease in lysosomal staining was observed after 15 and 30 min of 0.1% treatment. Tumor clusters were associated with cell membrane destruction in K21 primed cells. There was functional silencing of Mic60 via K21, especially with 1% concentration with reduced cell migration and invasiveness. Raman intensity differences were seen at 700 cm−1, 1200 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1 regions. EVs were detected within presence of fibroblast cells amongst K21 groups. Wound area and wound closure showed the progress of wound healing.
Conclusion
Over expression of CatK can be reduced by a newly developed targeted K21 based drug delivery system leading to reduced migration and adhesion of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. The K21 drug formulation can have great potential for cancer therapies due to targeting and cytotoxicity effects.

Abstract: Summary
The combination of endocrine therapy (ET) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors (CDK4/6i) was a hallmark in metastatic luminal breast cancer (BC). However, intrinsic and acquired resistance affects long-term efficacy. Here, we study the role of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) pathway in CDK4/6i resistance. We find that RANK overexpression in luminal BC is associated with intrinsic resistance to CDK4/6i, both in vitro and in mouse xenografts, and decreased proliferation rate and chronic interferon (IFN) γ response are highlighted as resistance drivers. Gene expression data from the NeoPalAna CDK4/6i clinical trial, and studies with palbociclib-resistant cell lines, show that RANK is upregulated after treatment with CDK4/6i, supporting a role in acquired resistance. Our study shows that RANK ligand (RANKL) inhibitors can restore sensitivity to CDK4/6i and prevent acquired resistance. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that pharmacological inhibition of the RANK pathway through RANKL blocking could represent an add-on to ET + CDK4/6i, warranting further clinical studies.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) via designed peptides is an effective strategy to perturb their biological functions. The Elongin BC heterodimer (ELOB/C) binds to a BC-box motif and is essential for cancer cell growth. Here, we report a peptide that mimics the high-affinity BC-box of the PRC2-associated protein EPOP. This peptide tightly binds to the ELOB/C dimer (kD = 0.46 ± 0.02 nM) and blocks the association of ELOB/C with its interaction partners, both in vitro and in the cellular environment. Cancer cells treated with our peptide inhibitor showed decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and perturbed gene expression. Therefore, our work proposes that blocking the BC-box-binding pocket of ELOB/C is a feasible strategy to impair its function and inhibit cancer cell growth. Our peptide inhibitor promises novel mechanistic insights into the biological function of the ELOB/C dimer and offers a starting point for therapeutics linked to ELOB/C dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Nitro-fatty acids (NFAs) are endogenous lipid mediators causing a spectrum of anti-inflammatory effects by covalent modification of key proteins within inflammatory signaling pathways. Recent animal models of solid tumors have helped demonstrate their potential as anti-tumorigenic therapeutics. This study evaluated the anti-tumorigenic effects of NFAs in colon carcinoma cells and other solid and leukemic tumor cell lines. NFAs inhibited the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) by directly targeting the 26S proteasome, leading to polyubiquitination and inhibition of the proteasome activities. UPS suppression induced the unfolded protein response, resulting in tumor cell death. The NFA-mediated effects were substantial, specific, and enduring, representing a unique mode of action for UPS suppression. This study provides mechanistic insights into the biological actions of NFAs as possible endogenous tumor-suppressive factors, indicating that NFAs might be key structures for designing a novel class of direct proteasome inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in various human genes are key factors in carcinogenesis. However, whether SNPs in bacterial pathogens are similarly crucial in cancer development is unknown. Here, we analyzed 1,043 genomes of the stomach pathogen Helicobacter pylori and pinpointed a SNP in the serine protease HtrA (position serine/leucine 171) that significantly correlates with gastric cancer. Our functional studies reveal that the 171S-to-171L mutation triggers HtrA trimer formation and enhances proteolytic activity and cleavage of epithelial junction proteins occludin and tumor-suppressor E-cadherin. 171L-type HtrA, but not 171S-HtrA-possessing H. pylori, inflicts severe epithelial damage, enhances injection of oncoprotein CagA into epithelial cells, increases NF-κB-mediated inflammation and cell proliferation through nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, and promotes host DNA double-strand breaks, collectively triggering malignant changes. These findings highlight the 171S/L HtrA mutation as a unique bacterial cancer-associated SNP and as a potential biomarker for risk predictions in H. pylori infections.

Abstract: Summary
HDAC3 and HDAC8 have critical biological functions and represent highly sought-after therapeutic targets. Because histone deacetylases (HDACs) have a very conserved catalytic domain, developing isozyme-selective inhibitors remains challenging. HDAC3/8 also have deacetylase-independent activity, which cannot be blocked by conventional enzymatic inhibitors. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) can selectively degrade a target enzyme, abolishing both enzymatic and scaffolding function. Here, we report a novel HDAC3/8 dual degrader YX968 that induces highly potent, rapid, and selective degradation of both HDAC3/8 without triggering pan-HDAC inhibitory effects. Unbiased quantitative proteomic experiments confirmed its high selectivity. HDAC3/8 degradation by YX968 does not induce histone hyperacetylation and broad transcriptomic perturbation. Thus, histone hyperacetylation may be a major factor for altering transcription. YX968 promotes apoptosis and kills cancer cells with a high potency in vitro. YX968 thus represents a new probe for dissecting the complex biological functions of HDAC3/8.

Abstract: Summary
The adult subventricular zone (SVZ) is a neurogenic niche that continuously produces newborn neurons. Here we show that serine racemase (SR), an enzyme that catalyzes the racemization of L-serine to D-serine and vice versa, affects neurogenesis in the adult SVZ by controlling de novo fatty acid synthesis. Germline and conditional deletion of SR (nestin precursor cells) leads to diminished neurogenesis in the SVZ. Nestin-cre+ mice showed reduced expression of fatty acid synthase and its substrate malonyl-CoA, which are involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis. Global lipidomic analyses revealed significant alterations in different lipid subclasses in nestin-cre+ mice. Decrease in fatty acid synthesis was mediated by phospho Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase that was AMP-activated protein kinase independent. Both L- and D-serine supplementation rescued defects in SVZ neurogenesis, proliferation, and levels of malonyl-CoA in vitro. Our work shows that SR affects adult neurogenesis in the SVZ via lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Genetically encoded fluorescent indicators are powerful tools for tracking cellular dynamic processes. Engineering these indicators requires balancing screening dimensions with screening throughput. Herein, we present a functional imaging-guided photoactivatable cell selection platform, Faculae (functional imaging-activated molecular evolution), for linking microscopic phenotype with the underlying genotype in a pooled mutant library. Faculae is capable of assessing tens of thousands of variants in mammalian cells simultaneously while achieving photoactivation with single-cell resolution in seconds. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we applied Faculae to perform multidimensional directed evolution for far-red genetically encoded calcium indicators (FR-GECIs) with improved brightness (Nier1b) and signal-to-baseline ratio (Nier1s). We anticipate that this image-based pooled screening method will facilitate the development of a wide variety of biomolecular tools.

Abstract: Background
Hyperglycemia-induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction is a major factor contributing to diabetic lower extremity ischemia. We intend to investigate the role of Dusp2 in hyperglycemia-induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction and related mechanisms.
Methods
The human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with high glucose (HG) as the cell model. Streptozotocin injection was performed to induce diabetes and femoral artery ligation was to induce hind limb ischemia in mice. The levels of Dusp2, p-p38 MAPK, E2F4, and p38 MAPK were evaluated by Western blot or quantitative real-time PCR. The laser Doppler perfusion imaging was conducted to measure blood flow recovery. The cell counting kit-8, transwell, and tube formation assay were performed to evaluate cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, respectively. CD31 immunohistochemical staining was carried out to detect the capillary density of gastrocnemius. The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were executed to explore the interaction between E2F4 and Dusp2.
Results
Dusp2 was highly expressed in HG-induced HUVECs and diabetic lower extremity ischemia model mice. Interference with Dusp2 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, as well as alleviated mouse diabetic hindlimb ischemia. Dusp2 knockdown up-regulated p-p38 MAPK levels. We verified the binding between E2F4 and Dusp2. Overexpressing E2F4 suppressed Dusp2 levels and promoted cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, co-overexpression of Dusp2 reversed the results.
Conclusions
Overexpressing E2F4 promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis by inhibiting Dusp2 expression and activating p38 MAPK to alleviate vascular endothelial cell dysfunction under HG stimulation.

Abstract: Epigenetic alterations have essential roles during colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) progression. As the coactivator of Wnt/b-catenin signaling, Pygopus 2 (Pygo2) binds H3K4me2/3 and participate in chromatin remodeling in multiple cancers. However, It remains unclear whether the Pygo2–H3K4me2/3 association has significance in COAD. We aimed to elucidate the roles of Pygo2 in COAD. Functionally, Pygo2 inhibition attenuated cell proliferation, self-renewal capacities in vitro. Pygo2 overexpression enhanced in vivo tumor growth. Besides, Pygo2 overexpression could also enhance cell migration ability and in vivo distal metastasis. Mechanistically, Pygo2 correlates positively with BRPF1 expressions, one epigenetic reader of histone acetylation. The luciferase reporter assay and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assay were used to find that Pygo2 coordinated with H3K4me2/3 modifications to activate BRPF1 transcriptions via binding to the promoter. Both Pygo2 and BRPF1 expressed highly in tumors and Pygo2 relied on BRPF1 to accelerate COAD progression, including cell proliferation rate, migration abilities, stemness features and in vivo tumor growth. Targeting BPRF1 (GSK5959) is effective to suppress in vitro growth of Pygo2high cell lines, and has mild effect on Pygo2low cells. The subcutaneous tumor model further demonstrated that GSK5959 could effectively suppress the in vivo growth of Pygo2high COAD, but not the Pygo2low subtype. Collectively, our study represented Pygo2/BRPF1 as an epigenetic vulnerability for COAD treatment with predictive significance.

Abstract: Exposure to weightlessness causes severe osteopenia, resulting in raised fracture risk. The current study aimed to investigate whether nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation protected against the osteopenia in hindlimb unloading (HLU) rats in vivo and modeled microgravity-induced osteoblastic dysfunction in vitro. The 3-mo-old rats were exposed to HLU and intragastrically administered NMN every 3 days (500 mg/kg body weight) for 4 weeks. NMN supplementation mitigated HLU-induced bone loss, evidenced by greater bone mass and biomechanical properties and better trabecular bone structure. NMN supplementation mitigated HLU-induced oxidative stress, evidenced by greater levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and activities of superoxide dismutase 2 and lesser malondialdehyde levels. Modeled microgravity stimulation using rotary wall vessel bioreactor in MC3T3-E1 cells inhibited osteoblast differentiation, which was reversed by NMN treatment. Furthermore, NMN treatment mitigated microgravity-induced mitochondrial impairments, evidenced by lesser reactive oxygen species generation and greater adenosine triphosphate production, mtDNA copy number, and activities of superoxide dismutase 2 and Complex I and II. Additionally, NMN promoted activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), evidenced by greater AMPKα phosphorylation. Our research suggested that NMN supplementation attenuated osteoblastic mitochondrial impairment and mitigated osteopenia induced by modeled microgravity.

Abstract: Summary
A central challenge in biology is to use existing measurements to predict the outcomes of future experiments. For the rapidly evolving influenza virus, variants examined in one study will often have little to no overlap with other studies, making it difficult to discern patterns or unify datasets. We develop a computational framework that predicts how an antibody or serum would inhibit any variant from any other study. We validate this method using hemagglutination inhibition data from seven studies and predict 2,000,000 new values ± uncertainties. Our analysis quantifies the transferability between vaccination and infection studies in humans and ferrets, shows that serum potency is negatively correlated with breadth, and provides a tool for pandemic preparedness. In essence, this approach enables a shift in perspective when analyzing data from “what you see is what you get” into “what anyone sees is what everyone gets.”

Abstract: Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic highlights an urgent need for effective antivirals. Targeting host processes co-opted by viruses is an attractive antiviral strategy with a high resistance barrier. Picolinic acid (PA) is a tryptophan metabolite endogenously produced in mammals. Here, we report the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of PA against enveloped viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A virus (IAV), flaviviruses, herpes simplex virus, and parainfluenza virus. Mechanistic studies reveal that PA inhibits enveloped virus entry by compromising viral membrane integrity, inhibiting virus-cellular membrane fusion, and interfering with cellular endocytosis. More importantly, in pre-clinical animal models, PA exhibits promising antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and IAV. Overall, our data establish PA as a broad-spectrum antiviral with promising pre-clinical efficacy against pandemic viruses SARS-CoV-2 and IAV.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can decrease viremia but are usually unable to counteract autologous viruses escaping the antibody pressure. Nonetheless, bNAbs may contribute to natural HIV-1 control in individuals off antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we describe a bNAb B cell lineage elicited in a post-treatment controller (PTC) that exhibits broad seroneutralization and show that a representative antibody from this lineage, EPTC112, targets a quaternary epitope in the glycan-V3 loop supersite of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. The cryo-EM structure of EPTC112 complexed with soluble BG505 SOSIP.664 envelope trimers revealed interactions with N301- and N156-branched N-glycans and the 324GDIR327 V3 loop motif. Although the sole contemporaneous virus circulating in this PTC was resistant to EPTC112, it was potently neutralized by autologous plasma IgG antibodies. Our findings illuminate how cross-neutralizing antibodies can alter the HIV-1 infection course in PTCs and may control viremia off-ART, supporting their role in functional HIV-1 cure strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting transcription replication conflicts, a major source of endogenous DNA double-stranded breaks and genomic instability could have important anticancer therapeutic implications. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is critical to DNA replication and repair processes. Through a rational drug design approach, we identified a small molecule PCNA inhibitor, AOH1996, which selectively kills cancer cells. AOH1996 enhances the interaction between PCNA and the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, RPB1, and dissociates PCNA from actively transcribed chromatin regions, while inducing DNA double-stranded breaks in a transcription-dependent manner. Attenuation of RPB1 interaction with PCNA, by a point mutation in RPB1’s PCNA-binding region, confers resistance to AOH1996. Orally administrable and metabolically stable, AOH1996 suppresses tumor growth as a monotherapy or as a combination treatment but causes no discernable side effects. Inhibitors of transcription replication conflict resolution may provide a new and unique therapeutic avenue for exploiting this cancer-selective vulnerability.

Abstract: The impact of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification on pri-miRNA in sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM), and its underlying regulatory mechanism, have not been fully elucidated. We successfully constructed a SICM mice model through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In vitro, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced HL-1 cells model was also established. The results showed that sepsis frequently resulted in excessive inflammatory response concomitant with impaired myocardial function in mice exposed to CLP, as indicated by decreases in ejection fraction (EF), fraction shortening (FS), and left ventricular end diastolic diameters (LVDd). miR-193a was enriched in CLP mice heart and in LPS-treated HL-1 cells, while overexpression of miR-193a significantly increased the expression levels of cytokines. Sepsis-induced enrichment of miR-193a significantly inhibited cardiomyocytes proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, while this was reversed by miR-193a knockdown. Furthermore, under our experimental conditions, enrichment of miR-193a in SICM could be considered excessively maturated on pri-miR-193a by enhanced m6A modification. This modification was catalyzed by sepsis-induced overexpression of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3). Moreover, mature miRNA-193a bound to a predictive sequence within 3′UTRs of a downstream target, BCL2L2, which was further validated by the observation that the BCL2L2-3′UTR mutant failed to decrease luciferase activity when co-transfected with miRNA-193a. The interaction between miRNA-193a and BCL2L2 resulted in BCL2L2 downregulation, subsequently activating the caspase-3 apoptotic pathway. In conclusion, sepsis-induced miR-193a enrichment via m6A modification plays an essential regulatory role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammatory response in SICM. The detrimental axis of METTL3/m6A/miR-193a/BCL2L2 is implicated in the development of SICM.

Abstract: Summary
Covalent drug discovery has undergone a resurgence over the past two decades and reactive cysteine profiling has emerged in parallel as a platform for ligand discovery through on- and off-target profiling; however, the scope of this approach has not been fully explored at the whole-proteome level. We combined AlphaFold2-predicted side-chain accessibilities for >95% of the human proteome with a meta-analysis of eighteen public cysteine profiling datasets, totaling 44,187 unique cysteine residues, revealing accessibility biases in sampled cysteines primarily dictated by warhead chemistry. Analysis of >3.5 million cysteine-fragment interactions further showed that hit elaboration and optimization drives increased bias against buried cysteine residues. Based on these data, we suggest that current profiling approaches cover a small proportion of potential ligandable cysteine residues and propose future directions for increasing coverage, focusing on high-priority residues and depth. All analysis and produced resources are freely available and extendable to other reactive amino acids.

Abstract: Summary
Speckle-type pox virus and zinc finger (POZ) protein (SPOP), a substrate recognition adaptor of cullin-3 (CUL3)/RING-type E3 ligase complex, is investigated for its role in cardiac fibrosis in our study. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) activation was achieved with TGF-β1 (20 ng/mL) and MI mouse model was established by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary, and lentivirus was employed to mediate interference of SPOP expression. SPOP was increased both in fibrotic post-MI mouse hearts and TGF-β1-treated CFs. The gain-of-function of SPOP promoted myofibroblast transformation in CFs, and exacerbated cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction in MI mice, while the loss-of-function of SPOP exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanistically, SPOP bound to the receptor of activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1) and induced its ubiquitination and degradation by recognizing Ser/Thr-rich motifs on RACK1, leading to Smad3-mediated activation of CFs. Forced RACK1 expression canceled the effects of SPOP on cardiac fibrosis. The study reveals therapeutic targets for fibrosis-related cardiac diseases.

Abstract: The hepatitis B Virus X (HBx) protein plays a crucial role in the HBV-induced hepatic steatosis. Fatty acid transport protein 2 (FATP2) is a key protein that is involved in hepatic lipogenesis, and it was found to be highly expressed in various metabolic diseases. However, Whether FATP2 is a key factor in the pathogenesis of HBx-induced hepatic steatosis remains unclear. In this study, we found that FATP2 was up-regulated by HBx in vitro and in vivo and participated in HBx-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Treatment of HBx-expressing cell lines and mice with FATP2 inhibitor (FATP2i) lipofermata ameliorated HBx-induced lipid accumulation and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation caused by lipid accumulation. Moreover, the liver injury of mouse was restored after FATP2i treatment. In summary, our results reveal that FATP2 is a key driver factor for HBx-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, and inhibition of FATP2 can ameliorates lipid accumulation caused by HBx. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of HBV-induced hepatic steatosis.

Abstract: Summary
The human pangenome, a new reference sequence, addresses many limitations of the current GRCh38 reference. The first release is based on 94 high-quality haploid assemblies from individuals with diverse backgrounds. We employed a k-mer indexing strategy for comparative analysis across multiple assemblies, including the pangenome reference, GRCh38, and CHM13, a telomere-to-telomere reference assembly. Our k-mer indexing approach enabled us to identify a valuable collection of universally conserved sequences across all assemblies, referred to as “pan-conserved segment tags” (PSTs). By examining intervals between these segments, we discerned highly conserved genomic segments and those with structurally related polymorphisms. We found 60,764 polymorphic intervals with unique geo-ethnic features in the pangenome reference. In this study, we utilized ultra-conserved sequences (PSTs) to forge a link between human pangenome assemblies and reference genomes. This methodology enables the examination of any sequence of interest within the pangenome, using the reference genome as a comparative framework.

Abstract: Homologous to the E6-associated protein carboxyl terminus domain containing 3 (HECTD3) has been reported to play an essential role in biological processes, including drug resistance, metastasis or apoptosis. However, the relationships between HECTD3 and Colorectal cancer (CRC) remain to be unclear. In this study, we discovered that HECTD3 expressed lowly in CRC compared with normal tissues and patients with low HECTD3 suffered from poorer survival outcomes relative to those with high HECTD3 levels. HECTD3 inhibition could significantly enhance proliferative, clone abilities and self-renewal capacities of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, our findings revealed that HECTD3 had endogenous interactions with SLC7A11 proteins. HECTD3 promoted the polyubiquitination of SLC7A11 to trigger the degradation of SLC7A11 proteins. Targeting HECTD3 could notably prolong the half-life period of SLC7A11 proteins, thereby promoting its stability. However, the cysteine mutation at amino acid 823 (ubiquitinase active site) of HECTD3 impaired the polyubiquitination of SLC7A11. HECTD3 deficiency depended on accumulated SLC7A11 proteins to accelerate malignant progression of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Thus, HECTD3 could suppress SLC7A11 levels to attenuate the SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake, leading to enhanced CRC ferroptosis. SLC7A11 inhibition through polyubiquitination by HECTD3 increased ferroptosis, thereby inhibiting CRC tumor growth. Taken together, these results showed that HECTD3 controlled the stability of SLC7A11 and uncovered the function of HECTD3/SLC7A11 axis in regulating CRC progression.

Abstract: Summary
Massive, parallelized 3D stem cell cultures for engineering in vitro human cell types require imaging methods with high time and spatial resolution to fully exploit technological advances in cell culture technologies. Here, we introduce a large-scale integrated microfluidic chip platform for automated 3D stem cell differentiation. To fully enable dynamic high-content imaging on the chip platform, we developed a label-free deep learning method called Bright2Nuc to predict in silico nuclear staining in 3D from confocal microscopy bright-field images. Bright2Nuc was trained and applied to hundreds of 3D human induced pluripotent stem cell cultures differentiating toward definitive endoderm on a microfluidic platform. Combined with existing image analysis tools, Bright2Nuc segmented individual nuclei from bright-field images, quantified their morphological properties, predicted stem cell differentiation state, and tracked the cells over time. Our methods are available in an open-source pipeline, enabling researchers to upscale image acquisition and phenotyping of 3D cell culture.

Abstract: Summary
Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) is the majority of ALS, and the lack of appropriate disease models has hindered its research. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology now permits derivation of iPSCs from somatic cells of sALS patients to investigate disease phenotypes and mechanisms. Most existing differentiation protocols are time-consuming or low efficient in generating motor neurons (MNs). Here we report a rapid and simple protocol to differentiate MNs in monolayer culture using small molecules, which led to nearly pure neural stem cells in 6 days, robust OLIG2+ pMNs (73%–91%) in 12 days, enriched CHAT+ cervical spinal MNs (sMNs) (88%–97%) in 18 days, and functionally mature sMNs in 28 days. This simple and reproducible protocol permitted the identification of hyperexcitability phenotypes in our sALS iPSC-derived sMNs, and its application in neurodegenerative diseases should facilitate in vitro disease modeling, drug screening, and the development of cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic “handshake” between the microbiota and its mammalian host is a complex, dynamic process with major influences on health. Dissecting the interaction between microbial species and metabolites found in host tissues has been a challenge due to the requirement for invasive sampling. Here, we demonstrate that secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (SESI-MS) can be used to non-invasively monitor metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiome of a live, awake mouse. By comparing the headspace metabolome of individual gut bacterial culture with the “volatilome” (metabolites released to the atmosphere) of gnotobiotic mice, we demonstrate that the volatilome is characteristic of the dominant colonizing bacteria. Combining SESI-MS with feeding heavy-isotope-labeled microbiota-accessible sugars reveals the presence of microbial cross-feeding within the animal intestine. The microbiota is, therefore, a major contributor to the volatilome of a living animal, and it is possible to capture inter-species interaction within the gut microbiota using volatilome monitoring.

Abstract: Summary
Serine/threonine protein phosphatase-5 (PP5) is involved in tumor progression and survival, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Specific inhibition of protein phosphatases has remained challenging because of their conserved catalytic sites. PP5 contains its regulatory domains within a single polypeptide chain, making it a more desirable target. Here we used an in silico approach to screen and develop a selective inhibitor of PP5. Compound P053 is a competitive inhibitor of PP5 that binds to its catalytic domain and causes apoptosis in renal cancer. We further demonstrated that PP5 interacts with FADD, RIPK1, and caspase 8, components of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway complex II. Specifically, PP5 dephosphorylates and inactivates the death effector protein FADD, preserving complex II integrity and regulating extrinsic apoptosis. Our data suggests that PP5 promotes renal cancer survival by suppressing the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of PP5 activates this pathway, presenting a viable therapeutic strategy for renal cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The biological activities of substances in the brain are shaped by their spatiotemporal dynamics in brain tissues, all of which are regulated by water dynamics. In contrast to solute dynamics, water dynamics have been poorly characterized, owing to the lack of appropriate analytical tools. To overcome this limitation, we apply stimulated Raman scattering multimodal multiphoton microscopy to live brain tissues. The microscopy system allows for the visualization of deuterated water, fluorescence-labeled solutes, and cellular structures at high spatiotemporal resolution, revealing that water moves faster than fluorescent molecules in brain tissues. Detailed analyses demonstrate that water, unlike solutes, diffuses homogeneously in brain tissues without differences between the intra- and the extracellular routes. Furthermore, we find that the water dynamics are steady during development and ischemia, when diffusions of solutes are severely affected. Thus, our approach reveals routes and uniquely robust properties of water diffusion in brain tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists are promising candidates for vaccine adjuvants and antitumor immune stimulants. The most potent natural agonist of STING, 2′,3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (2′,3′-cGAMP), is subject to nuclease-mediated inherent metabolic instability, thereby placing limits on its clinical efficacy. Here, we report on a new class of chemically synthesized sugar-modified analogs of 2′,3′-cGAMP containing arabinose and xylose sugar derivatives that bind mouse and human STING alleles with high affinity. The co-crystal structures demonstrate that such analogs act as 2′,3′-cGAMP mimetics that induce the “closed” conformation of human STING. These analogs show significant resistance to hydrolysis mediated by ENPP1 and increased stability in human serum, while retaining similar potency as 2′,3′-cGAMP at inducing IFN-β secretion from human THP1 cells. The arabinose- and xylose-modified 2′,3′-cGAMP analogs open a new strategy for overcoming the inherent nuclease-mediated vulnerability of natural ribose cyclic nucleotides, with the additional benefit of high translational potential as cancer therapeutics and vaccine adjuvants.

Abstract: Using some solutions activated by irradiation with non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma (NTAPP), we had discovered that a new and distinctive mode of cell death, named spoptosis, exists in cells, the induction of which involves the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it was unknown what types of ROS and how they trigger the cell death. When cells were treated with a higher dose of Ascorbic acid (AA) generating O2− and H2O2 or Antimycin A (AM) generating O2−, cell death occurred along with cellular shrinkage, Pdcd4 disappearance, and vesicle formation. Only in cells treated with AA, genomic DNA was digested irregularly and membrane permeability increased aberrantly. On the other hand, cells treated with a higher dose of H2O2 displayed cell death and cellular shrinkage but not the other events, and those treated with a lower dose of H2O2 displayed cell death but not the other events. Strikingly, when cells underwent double treatment with AM and H2O2, the events, which had not been observed by their single treatment, became compensated. All the events were suppressed with an antioxidant, confirming that they were mediated by ROS. Thus, the mode of cell death induced by AA or combination of AM and H2O2 was consistent with that of cell death by NTAPP-activated solutions. These results suggested that O2− and H2O2 collaboratively trigger spoptotic cell death with the associated events, and that AA and combination of AM and H2O2 are functionally alternative in place of NTAPP-activated solutions.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal fibrosis, often caused by inflammatory bowel disease, can lead to intestinal stenosis and obstruction, but there are no approved treatments. Drug discovery has been hindered by the lack of screenable cellular phenotypes. To address this, we used a scalable image-based morphology assay called Cell Painting, augmented with machine learning algorithms, to identify small molecules that could reverse the activated fibrotic phenotype of intestinal myofibroblasts. We then conducted a high-throughput small molecule chemogenomics screen of approximately 5,000 compounds with known targets or mechanisms, which have achieved clinical stage or approval by the FDA. By integrating morphological analyses and AI using pathologically relevant cells and disease-relevant stimuli, we identified several compounds and target classes that are potentially able to treat intestinal fibrosis. This phenotypic screening platform offers significant improvements over conventional methods for identifying a wide range of drug targets.

Abstract: Summary
Glutathione (GSH) is an abundant metabolite within eukaryotic cells that can act as a signal, a nutrient source, or serve in a redox capacity for intracellular bacterial pathogens. For Francisella, GSH is thought to be a critical in vivo source of cysteine; however, the cellular pathways permitting GSH utilization by Francisella differ between strains and have remained poorly understood. Using genetic screening, we discovered a unique pathway for GSH utilization in Francisella. Whereas prior work suggested GSH catabolism initiates in the periplasm, the pathway we define consists of a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) member that transports intact GSH and a previously unrecognized bacterial cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the first step of GSH degradation. Interestingly, we find that the transporter gene for this pathway is pseudogenized in pathogenic Francisella, explaining phenotypic discrepancies in GSH utilization among Francisella spp. and revealing a critical role for GSH in the environmental niche of these bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
In a healthy gut, microbes are often aggregated with host mucus, yet the molecular basis for this organization and its impact on intestinal health are unclear. Mucus is a viscous physical barrier separating resident microbes from epithelia, but it also provides glycan cues that regulate microbial behaviors. Here, we describe a mucin-sensing pathway in an Aeromonas symbiont of zebrafish, Aer01. In response to the mucin-associated glycan N-acetylglucosamine, a sensor kinase regulates the expression of an aggregation-promoting adhesin we named MbpA. Upon MbpA disruption, Aer01 colonizes to normal levels but is largely planktonic and more pro-inflammatory. Increasing cell surface MbpA rescues these traits. MbpA-like adhesins are common in human-associated bacteria, and the expression of an Akkermansia muciniphila MbpA-like adhesin in MbpA-deficient Aer01 restores lumenal aggregation and reverses its pro-inflammatory character. Our work demonstrates how resident bacteria use mucin glycans to modulate behaviors congruent with host health.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells. To identify targets for MM immunotherapy, we develop an integrated pipeline based on mass spectrometry analysis of seven MM cell lines and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from 900+ patients. Starting from 4,000+ candidates, we identify the most highly expressed cell surface proteins. We annotate candidate protein expression in many healthy tissues and validate the expression of promising targets in 30+ patient samples with relapsed/refractory MM, as well as in primary healthy hematopoietic stem cells and T cells by flow cytometry. Six candidates (ILT3, SEMA4A, CCR1, LRRC8D, FCRL3, IL12RB1) and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) present the most favorable profile in malignant and healthy cells. We develop a bispecific T cell engager targeting ILT3 that shows potent killing effects in vitro and decreased tumor burden and prolonged mice survival in vivo, suggesting therapeutic relevance. Our study uncovers MM-associated antigens that hold great promise for immune-based therapies of MM.

Abstract: Summary
Darobactins represent a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) antibiotics featuring a rare bicyclic structure. They target the Bam-complex of Gram-negative bacteria and exhibit in vivo activity against drug-resistant pathogens. First isolated from Photorhabdus species, the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are widespread among γ-proteobacteria, including the genera Vibrio, Yersinia, and Pseudoalteromonas (P.). While the organization of the BGC core is highly conserved, a small subset of Pseudoalteromonas carries an extended BGC with additional genes. Here, we report the identification of brominated and dehydrated darobactin derivatives from P. luteoviolacea strains. The marine derivatives are active against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria and showed solubility and plasma protein binding ability different from darobactin A, rendering it more active than darobactin A. The halogenation reaction is catalyzed by DarH, a new class of flavin-dependent halogenases with a novel fold.
