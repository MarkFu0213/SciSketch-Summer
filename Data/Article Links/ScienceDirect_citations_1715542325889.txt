Abstract: The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is a membranous organelle with diverse structural and functional domains. Peripheral ER includes interconnected tubules, and dense tubular arrays called “ER matrices” together with bona fide flat cisternae. Transitions between these states are regulated by membrane-associated proteins and cytosolic factors. Recently, the small GTPases Rab10 and Rab18 were reported to control ER shape by regulating ER dynamics and fusion. Here, we present evidence that another Rab protein, Rab7a, modulates the ER morphology by controlling the ER homeostasis and ER stress. Indeed, inhibition of Rab7a expression by siRNA or expression of the dominant negative mutant Rab7aT22 N, leads to enlargement of sheet-like ER structures and spreading towards the cell periphery. Notably, such alterations are ascribable neither to a direct modulation of the ER shaping proteins Reticulon-4b and CLIMP63, nor to interactions with Protrudin, a Rab7a-binding protein known to affect the ER organization. Conversely, depletion of Rab7a leads to basal ER stress, in turn causing ER membrane expansion. Both ER enlargement and basal ER stress are reverted in rescue experiments by Rab7a re-expression, as well as by the ER chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). Collectively, these findings reveal a new role of Rab7a in ER homeostasis, and indicate that genetic and pharmacological ER stress manipulation may restore ER morphology in Rab7a silenced cells.

Abstract: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) induced conformational changes of proteins can cause their activation or inactivation. Neutrophils clear pathogen through phagocytosis and oxidative burst generation, while participate in inflammation through sustained and uncontrolled generation of ROS. In activated PMNs, cytosolic NOX-2 subunit p47phox following phosphorylation interacts with p67phox, p40phox and along with Rac2 translocate to the membrane. Phosphorylation of p47phox subunit occurs in both short spurts as well as sustained ROS generation, suggesting towards the unidentified molecular mechanism(s) driving these two diverse outcomes by various stimuli. The present study demonstrates that in PMA or NO treated neutrophils a subunit of NOX2, p47phox gets glutathionylated to sustain ROS generation along with a decrease in catalase, Grx-1 activity and change in GSH/GSSG ratio. Surprisingly, fMLP treated cells neither showed sustained ROS production nor glutathionylation of p47phox. S-Glutathionylation was always secondary to phosphorylation of p47phox and inhibition of glutathionylation did not alter phosphorylation but specifically impaired sustained ROS production. Interestingly, forced S-glutathionylation of p47phox converted the fMLP induced ROS generation into sustained release of ROS. We then identified the glutathionylation susceptible cysteine residues of p47phox by LC-MS/MS with IAM switch mapping. Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine residues further mitigated p47phox S-glutathionylation. Thus, we demonstrate that p47phox S-glutathionylation plays an essential key role in the sustained ROS generation by human neutrophils.

Abstract: The three mitochondrial-encoded proteins, COX1, COX2, and COX3, form the core of the cytochrome c oxidase. Upon synthesis, COX2 engages with COX20 in the inner mitochondrial membrane, a scaffold protein that recruits metallochaperones for copper delivery to the CuA-Site of COX2. Here we identified the human protein, TMEM177 as a constituent of the COX20 interaction network. Loss or increase in the amount of TMEM177 affects COX20 abundance leading to reduced or increased COX20 levels respectively. TMEM177 associates with newly synthesized COX2 and SCO2 in a COX20-dependent manner. Our data shows that by unbalancing the amount of TMEM177, newly synthesized COX2 accumulates in a COX20-associated state. We conclude that TMEM177 promotes assembly of COX2 at the level of CuA-site formation.

Abstract: Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling promotes cell proliferation and cell survival. We previously reported that Ras1CA overexpression, specifically in the posterior silk glands (PSGs) of the silkworm Bombyx mori, increased fibroin synthesis and cell size, resulting in improved silk yields. In this study, we compared the iTRAQ-based phosphoproteomic profiles of PSGs from wild-type and Ras1CA-overexpressing silkworms. Silk gland factor 1 (SGF1), a FOXA transcription factor that plays a critical role in activating fibroin gene expression, was identified as a phosphoprotein harboring Ser91 as a potential MAPK phosphorylation site. Ser91 phosphorylation of SGF1 was enhanced by Ras1CA overexpression, and this finding was verified by selected reaction monitoring. Consistently, MAPK activity is well correlated with Ser91 phosphorylation of SGF1 and its nuclear localization in PSG cells during silkworm development. Ras1CA overexpression and treatment with inhibitors of Ras signaling promoted or inhibited SGF1 nuclear localization, respectively; mutation of Ser91 to Ala91 eliminated SGF1 nuclear localization. Moreover, MAPK binds to SGF1 and directly phosphorylates Ser91, demonstrating Ser91 as a MAPK phosphorylation site in SGF1. In conclusion, Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling promotes SGF1 nuclear localization for transactivation via Ser91 phosphorylation in silkworms, showing that FOXA transcription factors are regulated via MAPK phosphorylation in animals.

Abstract: d-Ribose (Rib), a reactive glycation compound that exists in organisms, abnormally increases in the urine of diabetic patients and can yield large amounts of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), leading to cell dysfunction. However, whether cellular proteins are sensitive to this type of glycation is unknown. In this study, we found that cellular AGEs accumulate in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with increased Rib concentration and administration time. Mass spectrum analysis of isolated AGE-modified proteins from cell lysates showed that glucose-regulated protein 78 kD (GRP78) is one of the main ribosylated proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed the interaction between AGEs and GRP78. Compared with d-glucose (Glc), Rib produced much more AGEs in cells. In kinetic studies, the first order rate constant of LDH released from CHO cells incubated with Rib was nearly 8-fold higher than that of Glc, suggesting that Rib is highly cytotoxic. Immunofluorescent co-localization analysis manifested partial superimposition of AGEs and GRP78, which were distributed throughout the endoplasmic reticulum. Western blotting showed that the expression of GRP78 is up-regulated and then down-regulated in CHO cells during Rib treatment. In the presence of Rib, the suppression of GRP78 expression either with transfected siRNA or with the inhibitor (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) dramatically increased AGE levels and decreased cell viability compared with these parameters in the control groups. GRP78 overexpression decreased AGE levels and rescued the cells from Rib-induced cytotoxicity. These data indicate that GRP78 plays a role in preventing Rib-induced CHO cell cytotoxicity.

Abstract: Signaling from the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) crucial for melanocyte proliferation and differentiation, is regulated by cytosolic β-arrestins (ARRBs). MC1R signaling is also negatively modulated by the E3-ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1), whose mutation causes hyperpigmentation, congenital heart defects and neurodegeneration in mice. We showed previously that although MC1R interacts stably with human ARRB1 or ARRB2, only ARRB2 mediates receptor desensitization and internalization. We analyzed MC1R-dependent ARRB ubiquitination, and the possible role of MGRN1. ARRB1 expressed in heterologous cells or human melanoma cells migrated in SDS-PAGE as a 55kDa protein whereas ARRB2 migrated as two major bands of apparent molecular weight near 45 and 55kDa, with an intermediate mobility band occasionally detected. These forms were related by post-translational modification rather than by proteolysis. Presence of MC1R favored expression of the 45kDa protein, the form that interacted preferentially with MC1R. MC1R also mediated poly- or multimonoubiquitination of ARRB2. Ubiquitination was agonist-independent, but required a native MC1R conformation and/or normal receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane, as it was not observed for loss-of-function MC1R variants. In a heterologous expression system, MC1R-dependent ARRB ubiquitination was enhanced by overexpression of MGRN1 and was impaired by siRNA-mediated MGRN1 knockdown thus pointing to MGRN1 as the responsible E3-ligase. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated interaction of MGRN1 and ARRBs in the presence of MC1R, suggesting a scaffolding role for the GPCR that may determine the selectivity of E3-ubiquitin ligase engagement and the functional outcome of ARRB ubiquitination.

Abstract: The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) promotes cellular cholesterol efflux, leading to cholesterol binding to the extracellular lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I. ABCA1 regulates lipid content, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue. In skeletal muscle, most GLUT4-mediated glucose transport occurs in the transverse tubule, a system composed by specialized cholesterol-enriched invaginations of the plasma membrane. We have reported that insulin resistant mice have higher cholesterol levels in transverse tubule from adult skeletal muscle. These high levels correlate with decreased GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake; however, the role of ABCA1 on skeletal muscle insulin-dependent glucose metabolism remains largely unexplored. Here, we evaluated the functional role of the ABCA1 on insulin-dependent signaling pathways, glucose uptake and cellular cholesterol content in adult skeletal muscle. Male mice were fed for 8 weeks with normal chow diet (NCD) or high fat diet (HFD). Compared to NCD-fed mice, ABCA1 mRNA levels and protein content were lower in muscle homogenates from HFD-fed mice. In Flexor digitorum brevis muscle from NCD-fed mice, shABCA1-RFP in vivo electroporation resulted in 65% reduction of ABCA1 protein content, 1.6-fold increased fiber cholesterol levels, 74% reduction in insulin-dependent Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation, total suppression of insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation and decreased 2-NBDG uptake compared to fibers electroporated with the scrambled plasmid. Pre-incubation with methyl-β cyclodextrin reestablished both GLUT4 translocation and 2-NBDG transport. Based on the present results, we suggest that decreased ABCA1 contributes to the anomalous cholesterol accumulation and decreased glucose transport displayed by skeletal muscle membranes in the insulin resistant condition.

Abstract: Epithelial tissue requires that cells attach to each other and to the extracellular matrix by the assembly of adherens junctions (AJ) and focal adhesions (FA) respectively. We have previously shown that, in renal papillary collecting duct (CD) cells, both AJ and FA are located in sphingomyelin (SM)-enriched plasma membrane microdomains. In the present work, we investigated the involvement of SM metabolism in the preservation of the epithelial cell phenotype and tissue organization. To this end, primary cultures of renal papillary CD cells were performed. Cultured cells preserved the fully differentiated epithelial phenotype as reflected by the presence of primary cilia. Cells were then incubated for 24h with increasing concentrations of D609, a SM synthase (SMS) inhibitor. Knock-down experiments silencing SMS 1 and 2 were also performed. By combining biochemical and immunofluorescence studies, we found experimental evidences suggesting that, in CD cells, SMS 1 activity is essential for the preservation of cell-cell adhesion structures and therefore for the maintenance of CD tissue/tubular organization. The inhibition of SMS 1 activity induced CD cells to lose their epithelial phenotype and to undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process.

Abstract: Regulated necrosis occurs in various pathophysiological conditions under oxidative stress. Here, we report that receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), a key player in one type of regulated necrosis (necroptosis), also participates in another type of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-dependent regulated necrosis (parthanatos). Various biological signatures of parthanatos were significantly attenuated in Ripk1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, including PARylation, nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor, and PARP1-dependent cell death under H2O2 exposure. Hence, we investigated whether RIPK1 regulates the activity of PARP1. RIPK1 activated PARP1 via an interaction with the catalytic domain of PARP1 in the nucleus. Of note, both wild type and kinase-dead mutant RIPK1 induced PARP1 activation and led to PARP1-mediated cell death upon H2O2 insult, demonstrating the kinase-independent regulation of RIPK1 in PARP1 activation. Collectively, our results demonstrate the existence of a kinase-independent role of nuclear RIPK1 in the regulation of PARP1.

Abstract: Spexin (SPX, NPQ) is a novel peptide involved in the regulation of energy metabolism. SPX inhibits food intake and reduces body weight. In obese humans, SPX is the most down-regulated gene in fat. Therefore, SPX might be involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Here, we study the effects of SPX on lipolysis, lipogenesis, glucose uptake, adipogenesis, cell proliferation and survival in isolated human adipocytes or murine 3T3-L1 cells. SPX and its receptors, GALR2 and GALR3, are present at mRNA and protein levels in murine 3T3-L1 cells and human adipocytes. SPX inhibits adipogenesis and down-regulates mRNA expression of proadipogenic genes such as Pparγ, C/ebpα, C/ebpβ and Fabp4. SPX stimulates lipolysis by increasing the phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). Simultaneously, SPX inhibits lipogenesis and glucose uptake in human adipocytes and murine 3T3-L1 cells. SPX has no effect on murine 3T3-L1 cell proliferation and viability. Moreover, our research showed that the SPX effect on adipocytes metabolism is mediated via GALR2 and GALR3 receptors. SPX is a novel regulator of lipid metabolism in murine 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes.

Abstract: Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-messenger (m)RNA is a pivotal mechanism in expanding proteomic diversity, which determines the functions of mammalian cells. By conducting transcriptome analyses to profile splicing events in human colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues compared to adjacent normal counterparts, we noted differential splicing profiles of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) and mitogen-activated protein 4 kinase 4 (MAP4K4) in cancerous tissues of CRC compared to adjacent normal tissues. In addition to SRSF3-mediated autoregulation, RNA-binding motif protein 4 (RBM4) constituted another mechanism in reprogramming the splicing profile of SRSF3. Upregulated expressions of SRSF3 in CRC cells modulated utilization of MAP4K4 exon 16 in a sequence-dependent manner. Alternatively spliced MAP4K4 variants exhibited differential effects on the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK1) which subsequently modulated expression profiles of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin, all of which are involved in the migration and invasion of CRC cells. Collectively, RBM4-SRSF3-MAP4K4 constitutes a novel mechanism for manipulating the metastasis of CRC cells through the JNK1 signaling pathway.

Abstract: The hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc), also named core antigen, is well-known for its key role in viral capsid formation and virus replication. Recently, studies showed that HBc has the potential to control cell biology activity by regulating host gene expression. Here, we utilized miRNA microarray to identify 24 upregulated miRNAs and 21 downregulated miRNAs in HBc-expressed HCC cells, which were involved in multiple biological processes, including cell motility. Consistently, the in vitro transwell assay and the in vivo tail-vein injection model showed HBc promotion on HCC metastasis. Further, the miRNA-target gene network analysis displayed that the deleted in liver cancer (DLC-1) gene, an important negative regulator for cell motility, was potentially targeted by several differentially expressed miRNAs in HBc-introduced cells. Introduction of miRNAs mimics or inhibitors and 3′UTR luciferase activity assay proved that miR-382-5p efficiently suppressed DLC-1 expression and its 3′-UTR luciferase reporter activity. Importantly, cotransfection of miR-382-5p mimics/inhibitors and the DLC-1 expression vector almost abrogated HBc promotion on cell motility, indicating that the miR-382-5p/DLC-1 axis is important for mediating HBc-enhanced HCC motility. Clinical HCC samples also showed a negative correlation between miR-382-5p and DLC-1 expression level. Furthermore, HBc-positive HCC tissues showed high miR-382-5p level and reduced DLC-1 expression. In conclusion, our findings revealed that HBc promoted HCC motility by regulating the miR-382-5p/DLC-1 axis, which might provide a novel target for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: β-Dystroglycan (β-DG) is a plasma membrane protein that has ability to target to the nuclear envelope (NE) to maintain nuclear architecture. Nevertheless, mechanisms controlling β-DG nuclear localization and the physiological consequences of a failure of trafficking are largely unknown. We show that β-DG has a nuclear export pathway in myoblasts that depends on the recognition of a nuclear export signal located in its transmembrane domain, by CRM1. Remarkably, NES mutations forced β-DG nuclear accumulation resulting in mislocalization and decreased levels of emerin and lamin B1 and disruption of various nuclear processes in which emerin (centrosome-nucleus linkage and β-catenin transcriptional activity) and lamin B1 (cell cycle progression and nucleoli structure) are critically involved. In addition to nuclear export, the lifespan of nuclear β-DG is restricted by its nuclear proteasomal degradation. Collectively our data show that control of nuclear β-DG content by the combination of CRM1 nuclear export and nuclear proteasome pathways is physiologically relevant to preserve proper NE structure and activity.

Abstract: In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high Galectin 3 (LGALS3) expression is associated with poor prognosis. The role of LGALS3 derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in the AML microenvironment is unclear; however, we have recently found high LGALS3 expression in MSC derived from AML patients is associated with relapse. In this study, we used reverse phase protein analysis (RPPA) to correlate LGALS3 expression in AML MSC with 119 other proteins including variants of these proteins such as phosphorylated forms or cleaved forms to identify biologically relevant pathways. RPPA revealed that LGALS3 protein was positively correlated with expression of thirteen proteins including MYC, phosphorylated beta-Catenin (p-CTNNB1), and AKT2 and negatively correlated with expression of six proteins including integrin beta 3 (ITGB3). String analysis revealed that proteins positively correlated with LGALS3 showed strong interconnectivity. Consistent with the RPPA results, LGALS3 suppression by shRNA in MSC resulted in decreased MYC and AKT expression while ITGB3 was induced. In co-culture, the ability of AML cell to adhere to MSC LGALS3 shRNA transductants was reduced compared to AML cell adhesion to MSC control shRNA transductants. Finally, use of novel specific LGALS3 inhibitor CBP.001 in co-culture of AML cells with MSC reduced viable leukemia cell populations with induced apoptosis and augmented the chemotherapeutic effect of AraC. In summary, the current study demonstrates that MSC-derived LGALS3 may be critical for important biological pathways for MSC homeostasis and for regulating AML cell localization and survival in the leukemia microenvironmental niche.

Abstract: Oxidative stress and P53 contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a master regulator of cellular antioxidant defense system, is negatively regulated by P53 and prevents DKD. Recent findings revealed an important role of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) in protection against DKD. However, the mechanism remained unclear. We hypothesized that MDM2 enhances NRF2 antioxidant signaling in DKD given that MDM2 is a key negative regulator of P53. The MDM2 inhibitor nutlin3a elevated renal P53, inhibited NRF2 signaling and induced oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, DKD-like renal pathology and albuminuria in the wild-type (WT) non-diabetic mice. These effects exhibited more prominently in nutlin3a-treated WT diabetic mice. Interestingly, nutlin3a failed to induce greater renal injuries in the Nrf2 knockout (KO) mice under both the diabetic and non-diabetic conditions, indicating that NRF2 predominantly mediates MDM2's action. On the contrary, P53 inhibition by pifithrin-α activated renal NRF2 signaling and the expression of Mdm2, and attenuated DKD in the WT diabetic mice, but not in the Nrf2 KO diabetic mice. In high glucose-treated mouse mesangial cells, P53 gene silencing completely abolished nutlin3a's inhibitory effect on NRF2 signaling. The present study demonstrates for the first time that MDM2 controls renal NRF2 antioxidant activity in DKD via inhibition of P53, providing MDM2 activation and P53 inhibition as novel strategies in the management of DKD.

Abstract: Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) is one of the leading causes of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). Although the immunoregulation function of NTHI outer member protein and endotoxin were confirmed, the role of NTHI DNA in activating immune responses remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found expression of IFN-β and IFN stimulated gene CXCL10 in host cells was forcefully elevated after treating with NTHI and NTHI DNA. Interestingly, we tested increased level of STING in NTHI infected mice lung. Meanwhile, STING expression in lung of mimic COPD murine model was higher than healthy mice after NTHI infection. Importantly, knockout of STING or overexpression of STING, TBK1 and IRF3 respectively impaired or enhanced IFN-β and CXCL10 expression during treating with NTHI and NTHI DNA. NTHI and NTHI DNA-induced I-IFN response appeared to be mediated by cGAS. Collectively, we suggested that NTHI DNA as a PAMP triggered I-IFN response, which was STING/TBK1/IRF3 dependent.
Summary
NTHI is the leading cause of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). Since AECOPD is an immune event, it is meaningful to elucidate the mechanism under NTHI induced immune response. It has been revealed that lipooligosaccharides and protein of NTHI could induce host immune response, but the function of NTHI nuclide acid during infection is unclear. In this research, we demonstrate NTHI DNA is a trigger for I-IFN expression, and the STING/TBK1/IRF3 pathway plays an integral role in sensing NTHI DNA to induce I-IFN expression. Moreover, by long-term intrabronchial infection of LPS, we constructed a mimic COPD murine model, in which the STING expression in lung tissues were higher than healthy mice after NTHI infection, which led us to surmise that NTHI cause AECOPD by inducing I-IFN production via STING signal pathway.

Abstract: Overexpression of γ-tubulin leads to the formation of filaments, but nothing is known about such filaments with regard to possible presence in cells, structure and probable dynamics. Here, we used mammalian cell lines to investigate the ability of γ-tubulin to form filaments. We found that γ-tubulin produces fibers called γ-tubules in a GTP-dependent manner and that γ-tubules are made up of pericentrin and the γ-tubulin complex proteins 2, 3, 5 and 6. Furthermore, we noted that the number of cells with cytosolic γ-tubules is increased in non-dividing cells. Our experiments showed that γ-tubules are polar structures that have a low regrowth rate compared to microtubules. Also, we observed that γ-tubules were disassembled by treatment with cold, colcemid, citral dimethyl acetal, dimethyl fumarate or mutation of γ-tubulin GTPase domain, but were increased in number by treatment with taxol or by stable expression of the γ-tubulin1–333 GTPase domain. Our results demonstrate that γ-tubulin forms filaments, and such assembly is facilitated by the GTPase domain of γ-tubulin.

Abstract: Expression of the intracellular form amastigote specific genes in the Leishmania donovani parasite plays a major role in parasite replication in the macrophage. In the current work, we have characterized a novel hypothetical gene, Ld30b that is specifically transcribed in the intracellular stage of the parasite. The recombinant Ld30b protein exists as a pentamer in solution as identified by native-PAGE and size exclusion gel chromatography. Structural analysis using circular dichroism and molecular modeling indicate that Ld30b belongs to family of cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I-alpha regulatory subunit. Co-localization immunofluorescence microscopy and western blot analyses (using anti-Ld30b antibody and anti-hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, a glycosome marker) on the isolated parasite glycosome organelle fractions show that Ld30b is localized in glycosome, though lacked a glycosome targeting PTS1/2 signal in the protein sequence. Episomal expression of Ld30b in the parasite caused the arrest of promastigotes and amastigotes growth in vitro. Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry indicates that these parasites are arrested in ‘sub G0/G1’ phase of the cell cycle. Single allele knockout of Ld30b in the parasite similarly attenuated its growth by accumulation of cells in the S phase of cell cycle, thus confirming the probable importance of appropriate level of protein in the cells. Studying such intracellular stage expressing genes might unravel novel regulatory pathways for the development of drugs or vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis.

Abstract: Differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into effector subtypes with distinct cytokine profiles and physiological roles is a tightly regulated process, the imbalance of which can lead to an inadequate immune response or autoimmune disease. The crucial role of Ca2+ signals, mainly mediated by the store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in shaping the immune response is well described. However, it is unclear if human effector CD4+ T cell subsets show differential Ca2+ signatures in response to different stimulation methods. Herein, we provide optimized in vitro culture conditions for polarization of human CD4+ effector T cells and characterize their SOCE following both pharmacological store depletion and direct T-cell receptor (TCR) activation. Moreover, we measured whole cell Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ currents (ICRAC) and investigated whether the observed differences correlate to the expression of CRAC genes. Our results show that Ca2+ profiles of helper CD4+ Th1, Th2 and Th17 are distinct and in part shaped by the intensity of stimulation. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are unique being the subtype with the most prominent SOCE response. Analysis of in vivo differentiated Treg unraveled the role of differential expression of ORAI2 in fine-tuning signals in Treg vs. conventional CD4+ T cells.

Abstract: The pathogen Helicobacter pylori, which infects half of the world's population, is a major risk factor for the development of gastric diseases including chronic gastritis and gastric cancer. Among H. pylori's virulence factors is the cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island (cagPAI), which encodes for a type IV secretion system (T4SS). The T4SS induces fast canonical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, a major factor increasing inflammation, supressing apoptotic cell death and thereby promoting the development of neoplasia. However, H. pylori's capability to mediate fast non-canonical NF-κB signaling is unresolved, despite a contribution of non-canonical NF-κB signaling to gastric cancer has been suggested. We analyzed signaling elements within non-canonical NF-κB in response to H. pylori in epithelial cell lines by immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and RNA interference knockdown. In addition, tissue samples of H. pylori-infected patients were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Here, we provide evidence for a T4SS-dependent direct activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling. We identified the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) to elicit the fast release of NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) from the receptor complex leading to non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Further, NIK expression was increased in human biopsies of H. pylori-associated gastritis. Thus, NIK could represent a novel target to reduce Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric inflammation and pathology.

Abstract: The ribosomal uL10 protein, formerly known as P0, is an essential element of the ribosomal GTPase-associated center responsible for the interplay with translational factors during various stages of protein synthesis. In eukaryotic cells, uL10 binds two P1/P2 protein heterodimers to form a pentameric P-stalk, described as uL10-(P1-P2)2, which represents the functional form of these proteins on translating ribosomes. Unlike most ribosomal proteins, which are incorporated into pre-ribosomal particles during early steps of ribosome biogenesis in the nucleus, P-stalk proteins are attached to the 60S subunit in the cytoplasm. Although the primary role of the P-stalk is related to the process of translation, other extraribosomal functions of its constituents have been proposed, especially for the uL10 protein; however, the list of its activities beyond the ribosome is still an open question. Here, by the combination of biochemical and advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques, we demonstrate that upon nucleolar stress induction the uL10 protein accumulates in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells as a free, ribosome-unbound protein. Importantly, using a novel approach, FRAP-AC (FRAP after photoConversion), we have shown that the ribosome-free pool of uL10 represents a population of proteins released from pre-existing ribosomes. Taken together, our data indicate that the presence of uL10 on the ribosomes is affected in stressed cells, thus it might be considered as a regulatory element responding to environmental fluctuations.

Abstract: Confocal and electron microscopy images, and WB analysis of cellular fractions revealed that HP1γ is in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm of C2C12 myoblasts, myotubes, skeletal and cardiac muscles, N2a, HeLa and HEK293T cells. Signal specificity was tested with different antibodies and by HP1γ knockdown. Leptomycin B treatment of myoblasts increased nuclear HP1γ, suggesting that its nuclear export is Crm-1-dependent. HP1γ exhibited a filamentous pattern of staining partially co-localizing with actin in the cytoplasm of myotubes and myofibrils. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis showed high-density immunogold particles that correspond to HP1γ localized to the Z-disk and A-band of the sarcomere of skeletal muscle. HP1γ partially co-localized with actin in C2C12 myotubes and murine myofibrils. Importantly, actin co-immunoprecipitated with HP1γ in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions of myoblasts. Actin co-immunoprecipitated with HP1γ in myoblasts incubated in the absence or presence of the actin depolymerizing agent cytochalasin D, suggesting that HP1γ may interact with G-and F-actin. In the cytoplasm, HP1γ was associated to the perinuclear actin cap that controls nuclear shape and position. In the nucleus, re-ChIP assays showed that HP1γ-actin associates to the promoter and transcribed regions of the house keeping gene GAPDH, suggesting that HP1γ may function as a scaffold protein for the recruitment of actin to control gene expression. When HP1γ was knocked-down, myoblasts were unable to differentiate or originated thin myotubes. In summary, HP1γ is present in the nucleus and the cytoplasm interacting with actin, a protein complex that may exert different functions depending on its subcellular localization.

Abstract: Oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis are important features, by which cells could bypass oxidative stress. The level of oxidative stress, and the ability of cells to promote oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis, significantly determined proliferation or cell demise. In the present work, we have employed selective mitochondrial probe MitoTracker™ Orange CMTM/Ros (MTO) to estimate the level of oxidative stress in cancer cells at different stressed conditions. MTO is partially sensitive to decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in mitochondria. We have demonstrated, that fluorescence lifetime of MTO is much more sensitive to oxidative stress than intensity-based approaches. This method was validated in different cancer cell lines. Our approach revealed, at relatively low ROS levels, that Gö 6976, a protein kinase C (PKC) α inhibitor, and rottlerin, an indirect PKCδ inhibitor, increased mitochondrial ROS level in glioma cell. Their involvement in oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis was investigated with oxygen consumption rate estimation, western blot and flow-cytometric analysis. Our study brings new insight to identify feeble differences in ROS production in living cells.

Abstract: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a programed course of developmental changes resulting in the acquisition of invasiveness and mobility in cells. In cancer, this course is used by epithelial cells to attain movability. Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) has been extensively characterized following the observation on tumor reversion ensuing its depletion. However, the role of TCTP in cancer progression is still elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that TCTP is a target of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a key regulator of EMT in A549 cells. We here present changes in expression patterns of intermediate filament markers (vimentin and cytokeratin 18a) of EMT following TCTP knockdown or over expression. The TCTP over-expression in cancer cells is associated with mesenchymal characters, while downregulation promotes the epithelial markers in the cells. Interaction of TCTP with β-catenin seems to stabilize β-catenin, preparative to its nuclear localization highlighting a role for β-catenin signaling in EMT. Moreover, the induction of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) following ectopic expression of TCTP leads to destabilization of ECM. The cells knocked down for TCTP show diminished invasiveness and migration under TGF-β1 treatment. The present results for the first time demonstrate that TGF-β1 dependent TCTP expression is required for EMT in cells.

Abstract: Hyperosmolarity is a controversial signal for renal cells. It can induce cell stress or differentiation and both require an active lipid metabolism. We showed that hyperosmolarity upregulates phospholipid (PL) de novo synthesis in renal cells. PL synthesis requires fatty acids (FA), usually stored as triglycerides (TAG). PL and TAG de novo synthesis utilize the same initial biosynthetic route: sn-glycerol 3P (G3P) → phosphatidic acid (PA) → diacylglycerol (DAG). In the present work, we evaluate how such pathway contributes to PL and TAG synthesis in renal cells subjected to hyperosmolarity. Our results show an increase in PA and DAG formation under hyperosmotic conditions; augmented DAG production, due to lipin enzyme activity, lead to the increase of both TAG and PL. However, at early stages (24 and 48 h), most of the de novo synthesized DAG was directed to PL synthesis; longer treatments downregulated PL synthesis and the DAG formed was mainly driven to TAG synthesis. Hyperosmolarity induced ACC and FASN transcription which mediated FA de novo synthesis. New FA molecules were stored in TAG. Silencing experiments revealed that hyperosmotic-induction of lipin-1 and -2 was mediated by SREBP1. Interestingly, SREBP1 knockdown also dropped SREBP2, indicating a modulatory action between both isoforms. Impairing SREBP activity leads to a decline in TAG levels but not PL. Membrane homeostasis is maintained through the adequate PL synthesis and renewal and constitute a protective mechanism against hyperosmolarity. The present data reveal the relevance of TAG synthesis and storage for PL synthesis in renal cells.

Abstract: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates chemical energy as heat via thermogenesis and protects against obesity by increasing energy expenditure. However, regulation of BAT by dietary factors remains largely unexplored at the mechanistic level. We investigated the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on BAT metabolism. Male C57BL/6J (B6) mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HF, 45% kcal fat) or HF diet supplemented with EPA (HF-EPA, 6.75% kcal EPA) for 11 weeks. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and microRNA (miRNA) profiling were performed on RNA from BAT using Illumina HiSeq and Illumina Genome Analyzer NextSeq, respectively. We conducted pathway analyses using ingenuity pathway analysis software (IPA®) and validated some genes and miRNAs using qPCR. We identified 479 genes that were differentially expressed (2-fold change, n = 3, P ≤ 0.05) in BAT from HF compared to HF-EPA. Genes negatively correlated with thermogenesis such as hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha subunit inhibitor (Hif1an), were downregulated by EPA. Pathways related to thermogenesis such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) were upregulated by EPA while pathways associated with obesity and inflammation such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) were downregulated by EPA. MiRNA profiling identified nine and six miRNAs that were upregulated and downregulated by EPA, respectively (log2 fold change > 1.25, n = 3, P ≤ 0.05). Key regulatory miRNAs which were involved in thermogenesis, such as miR-455-3p and miR-129-5p were validated using qPCR. In conclusion, the depth of transcriptomic and miRNA profiling revealed novel mRNA-miRNA interaction networks in BAT which are involved in thermogenesis, and regulated by EPA.

Abstract: Human phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) mediates the transfer of phospholipids among atheroprotective high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and atherogenic low-density lipoproteins (LDL) by an unknown mechanism. Delineating this mechanism would represent the first step towards understanding PLTP-mediated lipid transfers, which may be important for treating lipoprotein abnormalities and cardiovascular disease. Here, using various electron microscopy techniques, PLTP is revealed to have a banana-shaped structure similar to cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). We provide evidence that PLTP penetrates into the HDL and LDL surfaces, respectively, and then forms a ternary complex with HDL and LDL. Insights into the interaction of PLTP with lipoproteins at the molecular level provide a basis to understand the PLTP-dependent lipid transfer mechanisms for dyslipidemia treatment.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in the world and death from CRC accounts for 8% of all cancer deaths both in men and women in the United States. CRC is life-threatening disease due to therapy resistant cancerous cells. The exact mechanisms of cell growth, survival, metastasis and inter & intracellular signaling pathways involved in CRC is still a significant challenge. Hence, investigating the signaling pathways that lead to colon carcinogenesis may give insight into the therapeutic target. In this study, the role of atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) on CRC was investigated by using two inhibitors of that protein class: 1) ζ-Stat (8-hydroxynaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid) is a specific inhibitor of PKC-ζ and 2) ICA-I 5-amino-1-(2,3-dihydroxy-4-hydroxymethyl)cyclopentyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide) is a specific inhibitor of PKC-ι. The cell lines tested were CCD18CO normal colon epithelial and LOVO metastatic CRC cells. The inhibition of aPKCs did not bring any significant toxicity on CCD18CO normal colon cell line. Although PKC-ι is an oncogene in many cancers, we found the overexpression of PKC-ζ and its direct association with Rac1. Our findings suggest that the PKC-ζ may be responsible for the abnormal growth, proliferation, and migration of metastatic LOVO colon cancer cells via PKC-ζ/Rac1/Pak1/β-Catenin pathway. These results suggest the possibility of utilizing PKC-ζ inhibitor to block CRC cells growth, proliferation, and metastasis.

Abstract: The mammalian Grainyhead-like 3 (GRHL3) transcription factor is essential for epithelial development and plays a protective role against squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and of the oral cavity. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in GRHL3, rs141193530 (p.P455A), is associated with non-melanoma skin cancer in human patients. Moreover, it is known that this SNP, as well as another variant, rs41268753 (p.T454M), are associated with nonsyndromic cleft palate and that rs41268753 negatively affects GRHL3 transcriptional activity. These SNPs are located in adjacent codons of the GRHL3 gene, and the occurrence of either SNP abolishes a putative threonine-proline phosphorylation motif at T454 in the encoded protein. The role of phosphorylation in regulating mammalian GRHL function is currently unknown. In this work we show that GRHL3 is phosphorylated at several residues in a human keratinocyte cell line, among them at T454. This site is essential for the full transcriptional activity of GRHL3. The T454 residue is phosphorylated by p38 MAPK in vitro and activation of p38 signaling in cells causes an increase in GRHL3 activity. The regulation of GRHL3 function by this pathway is dependent on T454, as the substitution of T454 with methionine inhibits the activation of GRHL3. Taken together, our results show that T454 is one of the phosphorylated residues in GRHL3 in keratinocytes and this residue is important for the upregulation of GRHL3 transcriptional activity by the p38 pathway.

Abstract: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) frequently metastasises to the omentum, a process that requires pro-angiogenic activation of human omental microvascular endothelial cells (HOMECs) by tumour-secreted factors. We have previously shown that ovarian cancer cells secrete a range of factors that induce pro-angiogenic responses e.g. migration, in HOMECs including the lysosomal protease cathepsin D (CathD). However, the cellular mechanism by which CathD induces these cellular responses is not understood. The aim of this study was to further examine the pro-angiogenic effects of CathD in HOMECs i.e. proliferation and migration, to investigate whether these effects are dependent on CathD catalytic activity and to delineate the intracellular signalling kinases activated by CathD. We report, for the first time, that CathD significantly increases HOMEC proliferation and migration via a non-proteolytic mechanism resulting in activation of ERK1/2 and AKT. These data suggest that EOC cancer secreted CathD acts as an extracellular ligand and may play an important pro-angiogenic, and thus pro-metastatic, role by activating the omental microvasculature during EOC metastasis to the omentum.

Abstract: Posttranscriptional regulation process plays important roles in renal disease pathogenesis. AU-rich element RNA-binding protein (AUF1) interacts with and destabilizes mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3′UTR. The current study demonstrated that AUF1 was increased in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) animal models. While proliferation and migration of HK2 cells was unaltered by AUF1 downregulation under normal condition, proliferative inhibition and migratory promotion mediated by TGF-β was significantly compromised. Mechanically, AUF1 downregulation decreased phosphorylated Smad2/3 via increasing their E3 ligase Nedd4L at the posttranscriptional level. In addition, the current study identified Nedd4L as a previously unreported target of AUF1. AUF1 regulates Nedd4L expression at the posttranscriptional level by interaction with AREs in the 3’UTR of the Nedd4L mRNA. Collectively, the current study indicates that AUF1 might be a potential player in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis through modulation of TGF-β signal transduction via posttranscriptional regulation of Nedd4L.

Abstract: γ-Tubulin is essential for microtubule nucleation and also plays less understood roles in nuclear and cell-cycle-related functions. High abundancy of γ-tubulin in acentrosomal Arabidopsis cells facilitated purification and biochemical characterization of large molecular species of γ-tubulin. TEM, fluorescence, and atomic force microscopy of purified high molecular γ-tubulin forms revealed the presence of linear filaments with a double protofilament substructure, filament bundles and aggregates. Filament formation from highly purified γ-tubulin free of γ-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs) was demonstrated for both plant and human γ-tubulin. Moreover, γ-tubulin associated with porcine brain microtubules formed oligomers. Experimental evidence on the intrinsic ability of γ-tubulin to oligomerize/polymerize was supported by conservation of α- and β-tubulin interfaces for longitudinal and lateral interactions for γ-tubulins. STED (stimulated emission depletion) microscopy of Arabidopsis cells revealed fine, short γ-tubulin fibrillar structures enriched on mitotic microtubular arrays that accumulated at polar regions of acentrosomal spindles and the outer nuclear envelope before mitosis, and were also present in nuclei. Fine fibrillar structures of γ-tubulin representing assemblies of higher order were localized in cell-cycle-dependent manner at sites of dispersed γ-tubulin location in acentrosomal plant cells as well as at sites of local γ-tubulin enrichment after drug treatment. Our findings that γ-tubulin preserves the capability of prokaryotic tubulins to self-organize into filaments assembling by lateral interaction into bundles/clusters help understanding of the relationship between structure and multiple cellular functions of this protein species and suggest that besides microtubule nucleation and organization, γ-tubulin may also have scaffolding or sequestration functions.

Abstract: Annexins are a multigene family of proteins involved in aggregation and fusion processes of biological membranes. One of its best-known members is annexin A2 (or p36), capable of binding to acidic phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner, as occurs with other members of the same family. In its heterotetrameric form, especially with protein S100A10 (p11), annexin A2 has been involved as a determinant factor in innumerable biological processes like tumor development or anticoagulation. However, the subcellular coexistence of different pools of the protein, in which the monomeric form of annexin A2 is growing in functional relevance, is to date poorly described. In this work we present an exhaustive structural and functional characterization of monomeric human annexin A2 by using different recombinant mutants. The important role of the amphipathic N-terminal α-helix in membrane binding and aggregation has been analyzed. We have also studied the potential implication of lateral “antiparallel” protein dimers in membrane aggregation. In contrast to what was previously suggested, formation of these dimers negatively regulate aggregation. We have also confirmed the essential role of three lysine residues located in the convex surface of the molecule in calcium-free and calcium-dependent membrane binding and aggregation. Finally, we propose models for annexin A2-mediated vesicle aggregation mechanisms.

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large class of endogenous non-coding RNAs that function as regulators in various cells and tissues. Here, the function and mechanism of circRNA8073 (Circ-8073) on endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) and the development of endometrial receptivity were investigated in dairy goats. Circ-8073 could bind to and inhibit miR-449a activity. Circ-8073 binding to the target site of miR-449a had a negative feedback relationship. Centrosomal protein55 (CEP55) was a direct target gene of miR-449a, and Circ-8073 could increase the expression levels of CEP55 by sponging miR-449a in EECs in vitro. Circ-8073/miR-449a/CEP55 could promote EECs proliferation via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. In addition, CEP55 could regulate the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) in EECs, which contributed to the development of endometrial receptivity. These findings showed that Circ-8073 regulated CEP55 by sponging miR-449a to promote EEC proliferation via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, suggesting that it could function as a regulator in the development of endometrial receptivity in dairy goats.

Abstract: The natural product 2,4‑di‑tert‑butylphenol (DTBP) has a wide spectrum of biological functions, including anticancer activities, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we found that DTBP induces senescence in human gastric adenocarcinoma AGS cells as evidenced by upregulation of p21 and Rb and increased β‑galactosidase activity. DTBP also induces mitotic catastrophe and generates multinucleated cells, which is accompanied by an increase in the proportion of polymerized tubulin, possibly caused by inhibition of HDAC6 enzyme activity. In silico docking analysis showed that DTBP docked at the entrance of the ligand-binding pocket of the HDAC6 enzyme. Accordingly, DTBP represents a promising lead structure for the development of HDAC6 inhibitors, with an improvement in specificity conferred by modification of the cap group. We propose for the first time that the underlying mechanism of the anticancer activity of DTBP is attributed to inhibition of HDAC6 activity.

Abstract: The GRK/β-arrestin and PKC/PKA mediate the homologous and heterologous regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), respectively. Interaction between the two pathways is one of the most important issues in understanding the regulation of GPCRs. The present study investigated the regulatory effect of GRK2 and β-arrestins on PKC activation. The roles of GRK2 and β-arrestins in the functional regulation of PKC were assessed by determining their influence on PKC autophosphorylation and intracellular translocation. Radioligand binding assay was utilized to characterize intracellular trafficking of dopamine D2R, D3R, and β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR). The subdomains involved in the mutual interactions among GRK2, β-arrestin2, and PKCβII were determined by in vitro binding assay. Various point mutants of key regulatory players were combined with knockdown cells of GRK2, β-arrestins, and Mdm2 to functionally correlate the biochemical changes with functional outcomes. GRK2 and β-arrestin2 mutually inhibited the PKCβII autophosphorylation, a hallmark of PKCβII activation. β-Arrestin2 ubiquitination was required for the inhibitory activities of GRK2 as well as β-arrestin2. Furthermore, GRK2 facilitated β-arrestin2 ubiquitination, thus to enhance the inhibitory actions of β-arrestin2 on PKCβII activity. Aforementioned processes were also involved in the GRK2/β-arrestin2-mediated inhibition of the D2R, D3R, and β2AR endocytosis. The present study provides new insights into the intricate interactions between the homologous and heterologous GPCR regulation pathways. In addition, a novel regulatory role of GRK2 was proposed for the ubiquitination of β-arrestin in the context of the PKC-mediated heterologous regulation of GPCRs.

Abstract: ERAD is an important process of protein quality control that eliminates misfolded or unassembled proteins from ER. Before undergoing proteasome degradation, the misfolded proteins are dislocated from ER membrane into cytosol, which requires the AAA ATPase p97/VCP and its cofactor, the NPL4-UFD1 dimer. Here, we performed a CRISPR-based screen and identify many candidates for ERAD regulation. We further confirmed four proteins, FBOX2, TRIM6, UFL1 and WDR20, are novel regulators for ERAD. Then the molecular mechanism for WDR20 in ERAD is further characterized. Depletion of WDR20 inhibits the degradation of TCRα, a typical ERAD substrate, while WDR20 overexpression reduces TCRα protein level. WDR20 associates with TCRα and central regulators of the ERAD system, p97, GP78 and HRD1. A portion of WDR20 localizes to the ER-containing microsomal membrane. WDR20 expression increases TCRα ubiquitination, and HRD1 E3 ligase is essential for the process. WDR20 seems to serve as an adaptor protein to mediate the interaction between p97 and TCRα. Our study provides novel candidates and reveals an unexpected role of WDR20 in ERAD regulation.

Abstract: Retinoic acid (RA) plays a pivotal role in many cellular processes; however, the signaling mechanisms mediating the effect of RA are not fully understood. Here, we show that RA transcriptionally upregulates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr) by promoting the direct binding of its receptor RARα to Cftr promoter in mouse spermatogonia and embryonic stem (ES) cells. The RA/CFTR pathway is involved in the differentiation of spermatogonia and organogenesis during the embryo development of Xenopus laevis. Loss of CFTR by siRNA-mediated knockdown blunts the RA-induced spermatogonial differentiation. Overexpression of CFTR mimics the effect of RA on the induction of spermatogonial differentiation or restores the developmental defects induced by the knockdown of RARα in spermatogonial cells and Xenopus laevis. Analysis of the human database shows that the expression of CFTR positively correlates with RARα in brain tissues, stem cells as well as cancers, supporting the role of RA/CFTR pathway in various developmental processes in humans. Together, our study discovers an essential role of CFTR in mediating the RA-dependent signaling for stem cell differentiation and embryonic development.

Abstract: Arf6 (ADP-ribosylation factor 6) is known to play important roles in membrane dynamics through the regulation of actin filament reorganization for multiple cellular processes such as cytokinesis, phagocytosis, cell migration and tumor cell invasion. However, the functions of Arf6 in mammalian oocyte meiosis have not been clarified. In present study we showed that Arf6 expressed in mouse oocytes and was mainly distributed around the spindle during meiosis. Depletion of Arf6 by morpholino microinjection caused oocytes failing to extrude first polar body. Further analysis indicated that Arf6 knock down caused the aberrant actin distribution, which further induced the failure of meiotic spindle movement. And the loss of oocyte polarity also confirmed this. The regulation of Arf6 on actin filaments in mouse oocytes might be due to its effects on the phosphorylation level of cofilin and the expression of Arp2/3 complex. Moreover, we found that the decrease of Arf6 caused the disruption of spindle formation, indicating the multiple roles of Arf6 on cytoskeleton dynamics in meiosis. In summary, our results indicated that Arf6 was involved in mouse oocyte meiosis through its functional roles in actin-mediated spindle movement and spindle organization.

Abstract: Healthy mitochondria are required in cell metabolism and deregulation of underlying mechanisms is often involved in human diseases and neurological disorders. Post-translational modifications of mitochondrial proteins regulate their function and activity, accordingly, impairment of ubiquitin proteasome system affects mitochondria homeostasis and organelle dynamics. In the present study we have investigated the role of the ubiquitin protease Ubp8 in S. cerevisiae respiration. We show that Ubp8 is necessary for respiration and its expression is upregulated in glycerol respiratory medium. In addition, we show that the respiratory defects in absence of Ubp8 are efficiently rescued by disruption of the E3 Ub-ligase Psh1, suggesting their epistatic link. Interestingly, we found also that Ubp8 is localized into mitochondria as single protein independently of SAGA complex assembly, thus suggesting an independent function from the nuclear one. We also show evidences on the importance of HAT Gcn5 in sustaining Ubp8 expression and affecting the amount of protein in mitochondria. Collectively, our results have investigated the role of Ubp8 in respiratory metabolism and highlight the role of ubiquitin related pathways in the mitochondrial functions of S. cerevisiae.

Abstract: We previously reported that Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2) activity was decreased in human fibrotic livers. Here, we overexpressed Smurf2 in livers of transgenic mice and observed inhibited collagen deposition and hepatic stellate cell activation in fibrotic model induced by carbon tetrachloride treatment or bile duct ligation. Hepatic Smurf2 overexpression also inhibited the production of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a central mediator of liver fibrosis. Using miRNA array and bioinformatics analyses, we identified miR-132 as a mediator of this inhibitory effect. miR-132 directly targets the 3′-untranslated region of CTGF and was transcriptionally upregulated by cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling. In addition, Smurf2 activated cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway by interacting with phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) and facilitating its degradation. Thus, we have demonstrated a previously unrecognized anti-fibrotic pathway controlled by Smurf2.

Abstract: Oleaginous microorganisms are characterized by their ability to store high amounts of triacylglycerol (TAG) in intracellular lipid droplets (LDs). In this work, we characterized a protein of the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica that is associated with LD and plays a role in the regulation of TAG storage. This protein is required for the oleaginous phenotype of Y. lipolytica because deletion of the coding gene results in a strongly reduced TAG content of the mutant. Therefore, we named it Oleaginicity Inducing LD protein, Oil1. Furthermore, a mutant overexpressing OIL1 accumulates more TAG than the wild type and is delayed in TAG lipolysis when this process is stimulated. We found that Oil1p plays a role in protecting the TAG content of the LD from degradation through lipases under conditions where the cell aims at building up its TAG reserves. Heterologous expression studies showed that Oil1p rescued the phenotype of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant deleted for the perilipin-like protein Pln1p and that its expression in COS-7 cells resulted in increased TAG accumulation, similar to the phenotype of a perilipin 1 expressing control strain. Despite this phenotypical parallels to mammalian perilipins, Oil1p is not a member of this protein family and its activity does not depend on phosphorylation. Rather, our results suggest that ubiquitination might contribute to the function of Oil1p in Y. lipolytica and that a different mechanism evolved in this species to regulate TAG homeostasis.

Abstract: Sphingolipids are multifunctional lipids and a major constituent of the cell membranes of eukaryotes. Although the fatty acid (FA) moiety of sphingolipids is usually a saturated or monounsaturated FA, polyunsaturated FA (PUFA)-containing species also exist in mammalian tissues. In the present study, we showed that C24:2 PUFA-containing ceramide is one of the seven major ceramide species in a wide range of tissues. C24:2 ceramide levels were especially high in spleen and small intestine; in the former, it was the fourth most abundant ceramide species. However, both the synthetic pathway and the physiological function of C24:2 ceramide had yet to be identified. Tracer analysis using deuterium-labeled linoleic acid (C18:2) revealed that C24:2 ceramide is produced via elongation of linoleic acid. We also found that the FA elongase ELOVL1 and the ceramide synthase CERS2 were involved in C24:2 ceramide production. Sphingolipids are known to form lipid microdomains in membranes; however, in a detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) assay, we observed a lower proportion of C24:2 sphingomyelin in the DRM fraction than of saturated sphingomyelins, suggesting that C24:2 sphingolipids may act to negatively regulate lipid microdomain formation. Our findings expand our knowledge of sphingolipid diversity, and provide insight into how different sphingolipid molecular species play different functions in biological membranes.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a cytokine that can trigger apoptosis in many types of human cancer cells via engagement of its two pro-apoptotic receptors TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5). TRAIL can also activate several other signaling pathways such as activation of stress kinases, canonical NF-κB signaling and necroptosis. Though both receptors are ubiquitously expressed, their relative participation in TRAIL-induced signaling is still largely unknown. To analyze TRAIL receptor-specific signaling, we prepared Strep-tagged, trimerized variants of recombinant human TRAIL with high affinity for either DR4 or DR5 receptor. Using these receptor-specific ligands, we examined the contribution of individual pro-apoptotic receptors to TRAIL-induced signaling pathways. We found that in TRAIL-resistant colorectal HT-29 cells but not in pancreatic PANC-1 cancer cells, DISC formation and initial caspase-8 processing proceeds comparably via both DR4- and DR5-activated signaling. TRAIL-induced apoptosis, enhanced by the inhibitor of the Bcl-2 family ABT-737, or by the translation inhibitor homoharringtonine, proceeded in both cell lines predominantly via the DR5 receptor. ShRNA-mediated downregulation of DR4 or DR5 receptors in HT-29 cells also pointed to a stronger contribution of DR5 in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In contrast to apoptosis, necroptotic signaling was activated similarly by both DR4- or DR5-specific ligands. Activation of auxiliary signaling pathways involving NF-κB or stress kinases proceeded under apoptotic conditions mainly in a DR5-dependent manner, while these signaling pathways were during necroptosis similarly activated by either of these ligands. Our study provides the first systematic insight into DR4−/DR5-specific signaling in colorectal and pancreatic cancer cells.

Abstract: In mammalian cells, Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) plays a role in removing DNA damage induced by UV radiation. In Global Genome-NER subpathway, DDB2 protein forms a complex with DDB1 (UV-DDB), recognizing photolesions. During DNA repair, DDB2 interacts directly with PCNA through a conserved region in N-terminal tail and this interaction is important for DDB2 degradation. In this work, we sought to investigate the role of DDB2-PCNA association in DNA repair and cell proliferation after UV-induced DNA damage. To this end, stable clones expressing DDB2Wt and DDB2PCNA- were used. We have found that cells expressing a mutant DDB2 show inefficient photolesions removal, and a concomitant lack of binding to damaged DNA in vitro. Unexpected cellular behaviour after DNA damage, such as UV-resistance, increased cell growth and motility were found in DDB2PCNA- stable cell clones, in which the most significant defects in cell cycle checkpoint were observed, suggesting a role in the new cellular phenotype. Based on these findings, we propose that DDB2-PCNA interaction may contribute to a correct DNA damage response for maintaining genome integrity.

Abstract: Macrophages secrete endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon (IFN)-γ to enhance their phagocytic and nitric oxide (NO) synthetic activities. In this study, we found that a subset of secreted ERAP1 bound to exosomes released from LPS/IFN-γ-treated murine RAW264.7 macrophages compared to untreated cells. ERAP1-bound exosomes enhanced phagocytic and NO synthetic activities of macrophages more efficiently than free ERAP1 and exosomes derived from untreated cells. Deletion of the exon 10 coding sequence in ERAP1 gene resulted in loss of binding to exosomes. By comparing the activities of exosomes derived from wild-type and ERAP1 gene-deficient RAW264.7 cells, we observed that ERAP1 contributed to the exosome-dependent phagocytosis and NO synthesis of the cells. Upon stimulation of RAW264.7 cells with LPS/IFN-γ, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and CCL3 were also associated with the released exosomes. Analyses of cytokine function revealed that while CCL3 in the exosomes was crucial to the phagocytic activity of RAW264.7 cells, TNF-α and IFN-γ primarily contributed to the enhancement of NO synthesis. These results suggest that treatment with LPS/IFN-γ alters the physicochemical properties of exosomes released from macrophages in order to facilitate association with ERAP1 and several cytokines/chemokines. This leads to exosome-mediated enhancement of macrophage functions. It is possible that packaging effector molecules into exosomes upon inflammatory stimuli, facilitates the exertion of effective pathophysiological functions on macrophages. Our data provide the first evidence that ERAP1 associated with exosomes plays important roles in inflammatory processes via activation of macrophages.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have prevalent roles in cancer biology and regenerative medicine. Conventional techniques for characterising EVs including electron microscopy (EM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and tuneable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS), have been reported to produce high variability in particle count (EM) and poor sensitivity in detecting EVs below 50 nm in size (NTA and TRPS), making accurate and unbiased EV analysis technically challenging. This study introduces direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (d-STORM) as an efficient and reliable characterisation approach for stem cell-derived EVs. Using a photo-switchable lipid dye, d-STORM imaging enabled rapid detection of EVs down to 20–30 nm in size with higher sensitivity and lower variability compared to EM, NTA and TRPS techniques. Imaging of EV uptake by live stem cells in culture further confirmed the potential of this approach for downstream cell biology applications and for the analysis of vesicle-based cell-cell communication.

Abstract: Chronic exposure to Arsenic pollution in ground water is one of the largest environmental health disasters in the world. The toxicity of trivalent Arsenicals primarily happens due to its interaction with sulfhydryl groups in proteins. Arsenic binding to the protein can change the conformation of the protein and alter its interactions with other proteins leading to tissue damage. Therefore, much importance has been given to the studies of Arsenic bound proteins, for the purpose of understanding the origins of toxicity and to explore therapeutics. Here we study the dynamic effect of Arsenic on Connexin 43 (Cx43), a protein that forms the gap junctions, whose alteration deeply perturbs the cell-to-cell communication vital for maintaining tissue homeostasis. In silico molecular modelling and in vitro studies comparing Arsenic treated and untreated conditions show distinct results. Gap junction communication is severely disrupted by Arsenic due to reduced availability of unaltered Cx43 in the membrane bound form. In silico and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry studies revealed the interaction of Arsenic to the Cx43 preferably occurs through surface exposed cysteines, thereby capping the thiol groups that form disulfide bonds in the tertiary structure. This leads to disruption of Cx43 oligomerization, and altered Cx43 is incompetent for transportation to the membrane surface, often forming aggregates primarily localizing in the endoplasmic reticulum. Loss of functional Cx43 on the cell surface have a deleterious effect on cellular homeostasis leading to selective vulnerability to cell death and tissue damage.

Meiotic development initiation in the fungus Podospora anserina requires the peroxisome receptor export machinery,

Abstract: Peroxisomes are versatile organelles essential for diverse developmental processes. One such process is the meiotic development of Podospora anserina. In this fungus, absence of the docking peroxin PEX13, the RING-finger complex peroxins, or the PTS2 co-receptor PEX20 blocks sexual development before meiocyte formation. However, this defect is not seen in the absence of the receptors PEX5 and PEX7, or of the docking peroxins PEX14 and PEX14/17. Here we describe the function of the remaining uncharacterized P. anserina peroxins predictably involved in peroxisome matrix protein import. We show that PEX8, as well as the peroxins potentially mediating receptor monoubiquitination (PEX4 and PEX22) and membrane dislocation (PEX1, PEX6 and PEX26) are indeed implicated in peroxisome matrix protein import in this fungus. However, we observed that elimination of PEX4 and PEX22 affects to different extent the import of distinct PEX5 cargoes, suggesting differential ubiquitination-complex requirements for the import of distinct proteins. In addition, we found that elimination of PEX1, PEX6 or PEX26 results in loss of peroxisomes, suggesting that these peroxins restrain peroxisome removal in specific physiological conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that all analyzed peroxins are required for meiocyte formation, and that PEX20 function in this process depends on its potential monoubiquitination target cysteine. Our results suggest that meiotic induction relies on a peroxisome import pathway, which is not dependent on PEX5 or PEX7 but that is driven by an additional cycling receptor. These findings uncover a collection of peroxins implicated in modulating peroxisome activity to facilitate a critical developmental cell fate decision.

Abstract: Plant calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are key proteins implicated in calcium-mediated signaling pathways of a wide range of biological events in the organism. The action of each particular CDPK is strictly regulated by many mechanisms in order to ensure an accurate signal translation and the activation of the adequate response processes. In this work, we investigated the regulation of a CDPK involved in rice cold stress response, OsCPK17, to better understand its mode of action. We identified two new alternative splicing (AS) mRNA forms of OsCPK17 encoding truncated versions of the protein, missing the CDPK activation domain. We analyzed the expression patterns of all AS variants in rice tissues and examined their subcellular localization in onion epidermal cells. The results indicate that the AS of OsCPK17 putatively originates truncated forms of the protein with distinct functions, and different subcellular and tissue distributions. Additionally, we addressed the regulation of OsCPK17 by post-translational modifications in several in vitro experiments. Our analysis indicated that OsCPK17 activity depends on its structural rearrangement induced by calcium binding, and that the protein can be autophosphorylated. The identified phosphorylation sites mostly populate the OsCPK17 N-terminal domain. Exceptions are phosphosites T107 and S136 in the kinase domain and S558 in the C-terminal domain. These phosphosites seem conserved in CDPKs and may reflect a common regulatory mechanism for this protein family.

Abstract: Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is an integral plasma membrane protein and a complex regulator of signal transduction. The Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (Stat3) is activated by a number of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases and is positively implicated in cancer. Despite extensive efforts, the relationship between Cav1 and Stat3 has been a matter of controversy. We previously demonstrated that engagement of E- or N-cadherin or cadherin-11 cell to cell adhesion molecules, as occurs with confluence of cultured cells, triggers a dramatic increase in the levels of tyr705 phosphorylated i.e. activated Stat3, by a mechanism requiring the cRac1 small GTPase. Since confluence was not taken into account in previous studies, we revisited the question of the relationship between Cav1 and Stat3-ptyr705 in non-transformed mouse fibroblasts and in human lung carcinoma cells, by examining their effect at different cell densities. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that Cav1 downregulates cadherin-11, by a mechanism which requires the Cav1 scaffolding domain. This cadherin-11 downregulation, in turn, leads to a reduction in cRac1 and Stat3 activity levels. Furthermore, in a feedback loop possibly through p53 upregulation, Stat3 downregulation increases Cav1 levels. Our data reveal the presence of a potent, negative regulatory loop between Cav1 and cadherin-11/Stat3, leading to Stat3 inhibition and apoptosis.

Abstract: Pleural fibrosis is barely reversible and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs) which have apical-basal polarity play a key role in pleural fibrosis. Loss of cell polarity is involved in the development of fibrotic diseases. Partition defective protein (PAR) complex is a key regulator of cell polarity. However, changes of PMC polarity and PAR complex in pleural fibrosis are still unknown. In this study, we observed that PMC polarity was lost in fibrotic pleura. Next we found increased Lethal (2) giant larvae (Lgl) bound with aPKC and PAR-6B competing against PAR-3A in PAR complex, which led to cell polarity loss. Then we demonstrated that Lgl1 siRNA prevented cell polarity loss in PMCs, and Lgl1 conditional knockout (ER-Cre+/−Lgl1flox/flox) attenuated pleural fibrosis in a mouse model. Our data indicated that Lgl1 regulates cell polarity of PMCs, inhibition of Lgl1 and maintenance of cell polarity in PMCs could be a potential therapeutic treatment approach for pleural fibrosis.

Abstract: The phenomenon wherein the signaling by a given receptor is regulated by a different class of receptors is termed transactivation or crosstalk. Crosstalk between receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is highly diverse and has unique functional implications because of the distinct structural features of the receptors and the signaling pathways involved. The present study used the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and dopamine D3 receptor (D3R), which are both associated with schizophrenia, as the model system to study crosstalk between RTKs and GPCRs. Loss-of-function approaches were used to identify the cellular components involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), which is responsible for EGFR-induced regulation of the functions of D3R. SRC proto-oncogene (Src, non-receptor tyrosine kinase), heterotrimeric G protein Gβγ subunit, and endocytosis of EGFR were involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2. In response to EGF treatment, Src interacted with EGFR in a Gβγ-dependent manner, resulting in the endocytosis of EGFR. Internalized EGFR in the cytosol mediated Src/Gβγ-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2. The binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated GRK2 to the T142 residue of D3R resulted in uncoupling from G proteins, endocytosis, and lysosomal downregulation. This study identified the molecular mechanisms involved in the EGFR-mediated regulation of the functions of D3R, which can be extended to the crosstalk between other RTKs and GPCRs.

Abstract: Insulin binding to its cell surface receptor (IR) activates a cascade of events leading to its biological effects. The Insulin-IR complex is rapidly internalized and then is either recycled back to the plasma membrane or sent to lysosomes for degradation. Although most of the receptor is recycled or degraded, a small amount may escape this pathway and migrate to the nucleus of the cell where it might be important in promulgation of receptor signals. In this study we explored the mechanism by which insulin induces IR translocation to the cell nucleus. Experiments were performed cultured L6 myoblasts, AML liver cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin treatment induced a rapid increase in nuclear IR protein levels within 2 to 5 min. Treatment with WGA, an inhibitor of nuclear import, reduced insulin-induced increases nuclear IR protein; IR was, however, translocated to a perinuclear location. Bioinformatics tools predicted a potential nuclear localization sequence (NLS) on IR. Immunofluorescence staining showed that a point mutation on the predicted NLS blocked insulin-induced IR nuclear translocation. In addition, blockade of nuclear IR activation in isolated nuclei by an IR blocking antibody abrogated insulin-induced increases in IR tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear PKCδ levels. Furthermore, over expression of mutated IR reduced insulin-induced glucose uptake and PKB phosphorylation. When added to isolated nuclei, insulin induced IR phosphorylation but had no effect on nuclear IR protein levels. These results raise questions regarding the possible role of nuclear IR in IR signaling and insulin resistance.

Abstract: The periplasmic space in between the inner and outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria contains numerous chaperones that are involved in the biogenesis and rescue of extra-cytosolic proteins. In contrast to most of those periplasmic chaperones, PpiD is anchored by an N-terminal transmembrane domain within the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. There it is located in close proximity to the SecY subunit of the SecYEG translocon, which is the primary transporter for secretory and membrane proteins. By site-specific cross-linking we now found the periplasmic domain of PpiD also in close vicinity to the SecG subunit of the Sec translocon and we provide the first direct evidence for a functional cooperation between PpiD and the Sec translocon. Thus we demonstrate that PpiD stimulates in a concentration-dependent manner the translocation of two different secretory proteins into proteoliposomes that had been reconstituted with sub-saturating amounts of SecYEG. In addition we found ribosome-associated nascent chains of a secretory protein stalled at SecY also being in close contact to PpiD. Collectively these results suggest that PpiD plays a role in clearing the Sec translocon of newly translocated secretory proteins thereby improving the overall translocation efficiency. Consistent with this conclusion we demonstrate that PpiD contributes to the efficient detachment of newly secreted OmpA from the inner membrane and in doing so, seems to cooperate in a hierarchical manner with other periplasmic chaperones such as SurA, DegP, and Skp.

Abstract: The exposure and release of TF is regulated by post-translational modifications of its cytoplasmic domain. Here, the potential of Pin1 to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of TF, and the outcome on TF function was examined. MDA-MB-231 and transfected-primary endothelial cells were incubated with either Pin1 deactivator Juglone, or its control Plumbagin, as well as transfected with Pin1-specific or control siRNA. TF release into microvesicles following activation, and also phosphorylation and ubiquitination states of cellular-TF were then assessed. Furthermore, the ability of Pin1 to bind wild-type and mutant forms of overexpressed TF-tGFP was investigated by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally, the ability of recombinant or cellular Pin1 to bind to peptides of the C-terminus of TF, synthesised in different phosphorylation states was examined by binding assays and spectroscopically. Finally, the influence of recombinant Pin1 on the ubiquitination and dephosphorylation of the TF-peptides was examined. Pre-incubation of Pin1 with Juglone but not Plumbagin, reduced TF release as microvesicles and was also achievable following transfection with Pin1-siRNA. This was concurrent with early ubiquitination and dephosphorylation of cellular TF at Ser253. Pin1 co-immunoprecipitated with overexpressed wild-type TF-tGFP but not Ser258→Ala or Pro259→Ala substituted mutants. Pin1 did interact with Ser258-phosphorylated and double-phosphorylated TF-peptides, with the former having higher affinity. Finally, recombinant Pin1 was capable of interfering with the ubiquitination and dephosphorylation of TF-derived peptides. In conclusion, Pin1 is a fast-acting enzyme which may be utilised by cells to protect the phosphorylation state of TF in activated cells prolonging TF activity and release, and therefore ensuring adequate haemostasis.

Abstract: Phoenixin-14 (PNX) is a newly discovered peptide produced by proteolytic cleavage of the small integral membrane protein 20 (Smim20). Previous studies showed that PNX is involved in controlling reproduction, pain, anxiety and memory. Furthermore, in humans, PNX positively correlates with BMI suggesting a potential role of PNX in controlling fat accumulation in obesity. Since the influence of PNX on adipose tissue formation has not been so far demonstrated, we investigated the effects of PNX on proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes using 3T3-L1 and rat primary preadipocytes. We detected Smim20 and Gpr173 mRNA in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes as well as in rat primary preadipocytes. Furthermore, we found that PNX peptide is produced and secreted from 3T3-L1 and rat primary adipocytes. PNX increased 3T3-L1 preadipocytes proliferation and viability. PNX stimulated the expression of adipogenic genes (Pparγ, C/ebpβ and Fabp4) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiated in the presence of PNX had increased lipid content. Stimulation of cell proliferation and differentiation by PNX was also confirmed in rat preadipocytes. PNX failed to induce AKT phosphorylation, however, PNX increased cAMP levels in 3T3-L1 cells. Suppression of Epac signalling attenuated PNX-induced Pparγ expression without affecting cell proliferation. Our data show that PNX stimulates differentiation of 3T3-L1 and rat primary preadipocytes into mature adipocytes via cAMP/Epac-dependent pathway. In conclusion our data shows that phoenixin promotes white adipogenesis, thereby may be involved in controlling body mass regulation.

Abstract: Flippases are responsible for the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids in biological membranes. In the encapsulated fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, the putative flippase Apt1 is an important regulator of polysaccharide secretion and pathogenesis in mice by unknown mechanisms. In this study, we analyzed the role of C. neoformans Apt1 in intracellular membrane architecture and synthesis of polysaccharide and lipids. Analysis of wild type (WT), apt1Δ (mutant) and apt1Δ::APT1 (complemented) strains by transmission electron microscopy revealed that deletion of APT1 resulted in the formation of irregular vacuoles. Disorganization of vacuolar membranes in apt1Δ cells was accompanied by a significant increase in the amounts of intra-vacuolar and pigment-containing vesicles. Quantitative immunogold labeling of C. neoformans cells with a monoclonal antibody raised to a major capsular component suggested impaired polysaccharide synthesis. APT1 deletion also affected synthesis of phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, inositolphosphoryl ceramide, glucosylceramide and ergosterylglycoside. These results reveal novel functions of Apt1 and are in agreement with the notion that this putative flippase plays an important role in the physiology of C. neoformans.

Abstract: Microglia regulate immune responses in the brain, and their activation is key to the pathogenesis of diverse neurological diseases. Receptor-mediated lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling has been known to regulate microglial biology, but it is still unclear which receptor subtypes guide the biology, particularly, microglial activation. Here, we investigated the pathogenic aspects of LPA receptor subtype 1 (LPA1) in microglial activation using a systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration-induced septic mouse model in vivo and LPS-stimulated rat primary microglia in vitro. LPA1 knockdown in the brain with its specific shRNA lentivirus attenuated the sepsis-induced microglia activation, morphological transformation, and proliferation. LPA1 knockdown also resulted in the downregulation of TNF-α, at both mRNA and protein levels in septic brains, but not IL-1β or IL-6. In rat primary microglia, genetic or pharmacological blockade of LPA1 attenuated gene upregulation and secretion of TNF-α in LPS-stimulated cells. In particular, the latter was associated with the suppressed TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) activity. We reaffirmed these biological aspects using a BV2 microglial cell line in which LPA1 expression was negligible. LPA1 overexpression in BV2 cells led to significant increments in TNF-α production upon stimulation with LPS, whereas inhibiting LPA1 reversed the production. We further identified ERK1/2, but not p38 MAPK or Akt, as the underlying effector pathway after LPA1 activation in both septic brains and stimulated microglia.

Abstract: Autophagy is a catabolic process needed for maintaining cell viability and homeostasis in response to numerous stress conditions. Emerging evidence indicates that the ubiquitin system has a major role in this process. TRIMs, an E3 ligase protein family, contribute to selective autophagy acting as receptors and regulators of the autophagy proteins recognizing endogenous or exogenous targets through intermediary autophagic tags, such as ubiquitin. Here we report that TRIM50 fosters the initiation phase of starvation-induced autophagy and associates with Beclin1, a central component of autophagy initiation complex. We show that TRIM50, via the RING domain, ubiquitinates Beclin 1 in a K63-dependent manner enhancing its binding with ULK1 and autophagy activity. Finally, we found that the Lys-372 residue of TRIM50, critical for its own acetylation, is necessary for its E3 ligase activity that governs Beclin1 ubiquitination. Our study expands the roles of TRIMs in regulating selective autophagy, revealing an acetylation-ubiquitination dependent control for autophagy modulation.

Abstract: Accumulating evidences indicate that alcohol might play a causative in oral cancer. Unfortunately, in vitro cell systems, uncovering the molecular background of the underlying cell transformation process, are rare. Therefore, this study was conducted, to identify molecular changes and characterize their putative cell behavioral consequences in epitheloid (EPI) and fibroblastoid (FIB) oral keratinocyte phenotypes, arising from chronical alcohol treatment. Concerning adherens junctions (AJs), both EPI and FIB showed membrane-bound β-catenin, but exhibited differences for E-cadherin and zyxin. While EPI revealed E-cadherin/β-catenin membrane co-localization, which in parts also applied for zyxin, FIB membranes were devoid of E-cadherin and exhibited marginal zyxin expression. Fetal calf serum (FCS) administration in starved cells promoted proliferation in both keratinocyte phenotypes, whereat EPI and FIB yielded a strikingly modified FCS sensitivity on the temporal scale. Impedance measurement-based cell index detection yielded proliferation stimulation occurring much earlier in FIB (<20h) compared to EPI (>45h). Nuclear preference of the proliferation-associated YAP co-transcription factor in FIB was FCS independent, while it required FCS in EPI. Taken together, the lack of membrane-inherent E-cadherin/β-catenin co-localization together with low zyxin - reveals perturbation of AJ integrity in FIB. Regarding cell behavior, perturbed AJs in FIB correlate with temporal proliferation sensitivity towards FCS. CYF of 5.6 strongly suggests involvement of chromatin-bound YAP in FIB's proliferation temperosensitivity. These molecular differences detected for EPI and FIB are part of the underlying cell transformation process of alcohol-induced oral carcinogenesis, and indicate FIB being in a more advanced transformation stage.

Abstract: PUMA, a BH3-only pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family protein, is known to translocate from the cytosol into the mitochondria in order to induce apoptosis. Interestingly, the induction of PUMA by p53 plays a critical role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. In this study, we reported mitophagy inducing potential of PUMA triggered by phytolectin Abrus agglutinin (AGG) in U87MG glioblastoma cells and established AGG-induced ceramide acts as the chief mediator of mitophagy dependent cell death through activation of both mitochondrial ROS as well as ER stress. Importantly, AGG upregulates PUMA expression in U87MG cells with the generation of dysfunctional mitochondria, with gain and loss of function of PUMA is shown to alter mitophagy induction. At the molecular level, our study identified that the LC3 interacting region (LIR) located at the C-terminal end of PUMA interacts with LC3 in order to stimulate mitophagy. In addition, AGG is also found to trigger ubiquitination of PUMA which in turn interacted with p62 for prompting mitophagy suggesting that AGG turns on PUMA-mediated mitophagy in U87MG cells in both p62-dependent as well as in p62-independent manner. Interestingly, AGG-triggered ceramide production through activation of ceramide synthase–1 leads to induction of ER stress and ROS accumulation to promote mitochondrial damage as well as mitophagy. Further, upon pre-treatment with Mdivi–1, DRP1 inhibitor, AGG exposure results in suppression of apoptosis in U87MG cells indicating AGG-induced mitophagy switches to apoptosis that can be exploited for better cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Calpain-1 and -2 are Ca2+-activated intracellular cysteine proteases that regulate a wide range of cellular functions through the cleavage of their protein substrates. Unlike degradative proteases, calpains make limited, transformative cleavages, typically in accessible sequences linking discrete subdomains, to irreversibly alter substrate functions. The biological roles of calpain and their interplay with calcium signaling are of significant biomedical interest as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in a growing number of diseases including Alzheimer's, cancer and fibrosis. Unfortunately, many of the colorimetric and fluorimetric assays that have been developed to study calpain activity suffer from low sensitivity and/or poor calpain specificity. To address the need for a highly sensitive and calpain-specific substrate suitable for in vitro and in vivo calpain activity analysis, we have developed a protein FRET probe. We inserted the optimized calpain cleavage sequence PLFAAR between cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and modulated its flanking sequences for optimal calpain cleavage. We demonstrate greater sensitivity and calpain-specificity of an optimal 16-residue PLFAAR-based FRET substrate compared to a standard α-spectrin-based probe. The 16-residue PLFAAR protein FRET substrate is not significantly cleaved by trypsin, chymotrypsin, cathepsin-L or caspase-3, and is highly sensitive to both calpain-1 and -2. After transfection of the substrate gene into breast cancer cells the PLFAAR protein FRET product was cut in lysed wild-type cells but not in those with a calpain knock-out phenotype. Blockage of substrate cleavage in the lysates by endogenous and exogenous calpastatin was observed, and was overcome by adding extra calpain.

Abstract: The accumulation of vascular smooth muscle (SMC)-like cells and stem cell-derived myogenic and osteogenic progeny contributes significantly to arteriosclerotic disease. This study established whether label-free vibrational spectroscopy can discriminate de-differentiated ‘synthetic’ SMCs from undifferentiated stem cells and their myogenic and osteogenic progeny in vitro, compared with conventional immunocytochemical and genetic analyses. TGF-β1- and Jagged1-induced myogenic differentiation of CD44+ mesenchymal stem cells was confirmed in vitro by immunocytochemical analysis of specific SMC differentiation marker expression (α-actin, calponin and myosin heavy chain 11), an epigenetic histone mark (H3K4me2) at the myosin heavy chain 11 locus, promoter transactivation and mRNA transcript levels. Osteogenic differentiation was confirmed by alizarin red staining of calcium deposition. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) maps facilitated initial screening and discrimination while Raman spectroscopy of individual cell nuclei revealed specific spectral signatures of each cell type in vitro, using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). PCA fed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) enabled quantification of this discrimination and the sensitivity and specificity value was determined for all cell populations based on a leave-one-out cross validation method and revealed that de-differentiated SMCs and stem-cell derived myogenic progeny in culture shared the greatest similarity. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy discriminated undifferentiated stem cells from both their myogenic and osteogenic progeny. The ability to detect stem cell-derived myogenic progeny using label-free platforms in situ may facilitate interrogation of these important phenotypes during vascular disease progression.

Abstract: Diacylglycerol acyltranferase-2 (DGAT2) is a resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that catalyzes the synthesis of triacylglycerol. When lipid droplet formation is stimulated by incubating cells with fatty acids, DGAT2 becomes concentrated around the surface of cytosolic lipid droplets. Using confocal microscopy and directed mutagenesis, we have identified a 17-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region of DGAT2 that is necessary and sufficient for targeting DGAT2 to lipid droplets. When this region was deleted, DGAT2 remained in the ER and did not target to lipid droplets. Fusing this sequence to mCherry directed the fluorescent reporter to lipid droplets. Similarly, when the corresponding region of monoacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (MGAT2) was replaced with this sequence, MGAT2 was also targeted to lipid droplets. Lastly, we demonstrated that DGAT2 in ER membranes is continuous with lipid droplets. We propose a new model whereby DGAT2 remains in the ER during lipid droplet formation via it's transmembrane domains and interacts with nascent lipid droplets via its C-terminal lipid droplet interacting domain as they expand.

Abstract: The Secretory Pathway Ca2+ ATPases SPCA1 and SPCA2 transport Ca2+ and Mn2+ into the Golgi and Secretory Pathway. SPCA2 mediates store-independent Ca2+ entry (SICE) via STIM1-independent activation of Orai1, inducing constitutive Ca2+ influx in mammary epithelial cells during lactation. Here, we show that like SPCA2, also the overexpression of the ubiquitous SPCA1 induces cytosolic Ca2+ influx, which is abolished by Orai1 knockdown and occurs independently of STIM1. This process elevates the Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol and in the non-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, pointing to a functional coupling between Orai1 and SPCA1. In agreement with this, we demonstrate via Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy that Orai1 and SPCA1a co-localize near the plasma membrane. Interestingly, SPCA1 overexpression also induces Golgi swelling, which coincides with translocation of the transcription factor TFE3 to the nucleus, a marker of Golgi stress. The induction of Golgi stress depends on a combination of SPCA1 activity and SICE, suggesting a role for the increased Ca2+ level in the non-ER stores. Finally, we tested whether impaired SPCA1a/Orai1 coupling may be implicated in the skin disorder Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD), which is caused by SPCA1 loss-of-function. We identified HHD-associated SPCA1a mutations that impair either the Ca2+ transport function, Orai1 activation, or both, while all mutations affect the Ca2+ content of the non-ER stores. Thus, the functional coupling between SPCA1 and Orai1 increases cytosolic and intraluminal Ca2+ levels, representing a novel mechanism of SICE that may be affected in HHD.

Abstract: Claudins, tight junctional proteins, regulate the paracellular permeability of ions and small molecules. Claudin-2 is highly expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma cells and is involved in the up-regulation of cell proliferation. However, the effect of claudin-2 on cellular sensitivity to anticancer agents has not been clarified. The cytotoxicity of anticancer agents such as cisplatin, gefitinib and doxorubicin (DXR) was increased by claudin-2 knockdown in A549 cells. Claudin-2 knockdown also significantly decreased the expression level of multidrug resistance-associated protein/ABCC2. The expression levels of other drug efflux transporters were unchanged. The intracellular accumulation of 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) and DXR, substrates of ABCC2, was increased by claudin-2 knockdown, whereas the efflux was decreased. MK-571, an inhibitor of ABCC2, enhanced the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents. Claudin-2 knockdown decreased the levels of p-c-Jun and nuclear Sp1. SP600125, an inhibitor of c-Jun, and mithramycin, an inhibitor of Sp1, decreased the level of ABCC2. The promoter activity of ABCC2 was decreased by claudin-2 knockdown, SP600125 and mithramycin treatments, suggesting that claudin-2 is involved in the up-regulation of ABCC2 expression at the transcriptional level. Claudin-2 knockdown increased the paracellular permeability of DXR in a 2D monolayer culture model. In addition, the accumulation of DXR into spheroids was enhanced by claudin-2 knockdown, resulting in a reduction in cell viability. We suggest that claudin-2 may be a novel therapeutic target in lung adenocarcinoma, because claudin-2 knockdown increased the accumulation of anticancer agents in cancer cells and spheroids.

Abstract: Malaria parasites use an extensive secretory pathway to traffic a number of proteins within itself and beyond. In higher eukaryotes, Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) membrane bound transcription factors such as SREBP are reported to get processed en route and migrate to nucleus under the influence of specific cues. However, a protein constitutively trafficked to the nucleus via classical secretory pathway has not been reported. Herein, we report the presence of a novel trafficking pathway in an apicomplexan, Plasmodium falciparum where a homologue of an Origin Recognition Complex 2 (Orc2) goes to the nucleus following its association with the ER. Our work highlights the unconventional role of ER in protein trafficking and reports for the first time an ORC homologue getting trafficked through such a pathway to the nucleus where it may be involved in DNA replication and other ancillary functions. Such trafficking pathways may have a profound impact on the cell biology of a malaria parasite and have significant implications in strategizing new antimalarials.

Abstract: MOAP-1 is a pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor molecule with a growing set of known interacting partners. We have demonstrated that during death receptor-dependent apoptosis, MOAP-1 is recruited to TNF-R1 or TRAIL-R1, followed by RASSF1A and Bax association. MOAP-1/Bax association promotes Bax conformational change resulting in the translocation of Bax into the mitochondrial membrane, mitochondrial membrane insertion and dysregulation resulting in several hallmark events that execute apoptosis. Although a role in apoptosis is established, it is currently unknown how MOAP-1 is regulated and how it links to Bax to promote apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrate robust association with RACK1, a versatile scaffolding protein that responds to activation of protein kinase C. Furthermore, we can demonstrate that RACK1 functions to bring the E3 ligase, TRAF2, to MOAP-1 in order to undergo a K63-dependent ubiquitination. Furthermore, RACK1 associates with MOAP-1 via electrostatic associations similar to those observed between MOAP-1/RASSF1A and MOAP-1/TNF-R1. These events illustrate the complex nature of MOAP-1 regulation and characterizes the important role of the scaffolding protein, RACK1, in influencing MOAP-1 biology.

Abstract: Background
The Ras-homologous GTPase Rac1 plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression, cytoskeleton-associated processes and cell death as well as carcinogenesis and inflammation. Here, we investigated the impact of Rac1 signaling on liver-mediated immune homeostasis.
Methods
We employed a constitutive Alb-Cre-driven rac1 knock-out and a poly I:C-inducible Mx1-Cre-based knock-out model and analyzed cytokine expression profiles in liver and other organs under basal situation and following LPS-induced endotoxemia by flow cytometry, qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry.
Results
Constitutive Alb-Cre-driven rac1 knockout in hepatocytes altered the basal distribution and activation of immune cells in the liver and likewise in kidney and lung. Early systemic alterations in cytokine serum levels following LPS treatment remained unaffected by Rac1. Furthermore, lack of Rac1 in hepatocytes of untreated animals shifted the liver to a chronic inflammatory state, as depicted by an enhanced mRNA expression of marker genes related to activated macrophages. Upon acute LPS-induced endotoxemia, increased IL-10 mRNA expression in the liver of Alb-Cre Rac1-deficient mice provided an anti-inflammatory response. Employing a poly I:C-inducible Mx1-Cre-based rac1 knock-out, which allows a more widespread rac1 deletion in both hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes, we observed substantial differences regarding both basal and LPS-stimulated cytokine expression profiles as compared to the Alb-Cre system.
Conclusions
Rac1-dependent mechanisms in hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes contribute to the maintenance of liver immune homeostasis under basal situation and following LPS-induced endotoxemia. Disturbed Rac1-regulated hepatocyte functions may promote liver damage under pathophysiological situation involving inflammatory stress.

Abstract: The L-type calcium channel (LTCC) is an important determinant of cardiac contractility. Therefore, changes in LTCC activity or protein levels could be expected to affect cardiac function. Several studies describing LTCC regulation are available, but only a few examine LTCC protein stability. Polycystin-1 (PC1) is a mechanosensor that regulates heart contractility and is involved in mechanical stretch-induced cardiac hypertrophy. PC1 was originally described as an unconventional Gi/o protein-coupled receptor in renal cells. We recently reported that PC1 regulates LTCC stability in cardiomyocytes under stress; however, the mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown. Here, we use cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and hypo-osmotic stress (HS) to model mechanical stretch. The model shows that the Cavβ2 subunit is necessary for LTCC stabilization in cardiomyocytes during mechanical stretch, acting through an AKT-dependent mechanism. Our data also shows that AKT activation depends on the G protein-coupled receptor activity of PC1, specifically its G protein-binding domain, and the associated Gβγ subunit of a heterotrimeric Gi/o protein. In fact, over-expression of the human PC1 C-terminal mutant lacking the G protein-binding domain blunted the AKT activation-induced increase in Cav1.2 protein in cardiomyocytes. These findings provide novel evidence that PC1 is involved in the regulation of cardiac LTCCs through a Giβγ-AKT-Cavβ2 pathway, suggesting a new mechanism for regulation of cardiac function.

Abstract: Alternative splicing of precursor messenger RNA has been increasingly associated with tumorigenesis. The serine/arginine-rich protein (SR) family plays key roles in the regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the SR protein family is involved in tumorigenesis. However, the functions and mechanisms of SR proteins in tumourigenesis remain largely unknown. In the present study, we discovered that serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 5 (SRSF5) is a novel oncogenic splicing factor that is overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissues and cells, being crucial for OSCC cell proliferation and tumor formation. Overexpression of SRSF5 transformed immortal rodent fibroblasts to form tumors in nude mice, while downregulation of SRSF5 in oral squamous cell lines retarded cell growth, cell cycle progression, and tumor growth. The expression of SRSF5 is controlled by an autoregulation mechanism. Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) has been identified as an oncogene. We found that SRSF5 is a novel target of SRSF3. SRSF3 impairs the autoregulation of SRSF5 and promotes SRSF5 overexpression in cancer cells. Altogether, the present study demonstrated that SRSF5 is a novel oncogene that is upregulated by SRSF3 in OSCC cells.

Abstract: Heparan acetyl CoA: α-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT) is a lysosomal multi-pass transmembrane protein whose deficiency may lead to an accumulation of heparan sulphate and the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIC. In this study, HGSNAT activity was detected in extracellular vesicles isolated from both human urine and culture medium conditioned with HEK 293T cells. We also demonstrate that HGSNAT co-immunoprecipitates with antibodies to ALIX, which is associated with the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins, and is implicated in the targeting of proteins to intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies, the origin of exosomes. Furthermore, mutation of a putative LYPXnL-based binding site within HGSNAT for the V-domain of ALIX ablated association of HGSNAT with ALIX, post-translational maturation, and transport through the endo-lysosomal network. Unexpectedly, however, a mutation within the V-domain of ALIX demonstrated enhanced HGSNAT association, perhaps due to the actual involvement of other binding sites in this interaction. Indeed, HGSNAT still co-immunoprecipitates with truncations of ALIX lacking the V-domain. Interestingly, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knock-down of ALIX did not inhibit HGSNAT trafficking through the endo-lysosomal network, suggesting that there is an alternative pathway for trafficking HGSNAT that does not require ALIX. Nonetheless, the targeting of HGSNAT to extracellular vesicles may provide a mechanism to subsequently transfer this enzyme extracellularly to provide a foundation for a therapy for MPS IIIC patients.

Abstract: In microalgae, triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis occurs by parallel pathways involving both the chloroplast and endoplasmic reticulum. A better understanding of contribution of each pathway to TAG assembly facilitates enhanced TAG production via rational genetic engineering of microalgae. Here, using a UPLC-MS(/MS) coupled with TLC-GC-based lipidomic platform, the early response of the major glycerolipids to nitrogen stress was analyzed at both the cellular and chloroplastidic levels in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Subcellular lipidomic analysis demonstrated that TAG was accumulated exclusively outside the chloroplast, and remained unaltered inside the chloroplast after 4 h of nitrogen starvation. This study ascertained the existence of the glycolipid, digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), outside the chloroplast and the betaine lipid, diacylglycerol-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserine (DGTS), inside the chloroplast. The newly synthesized DGDG and DGTS prominently increased at the extra-chloroplastidic compartments and served as the major precursors for TAG biosynthesis. In particular, DGDG contributed to the extra-chloroplastidic TAG assembly in form of diacylglycerol (DAG) and DGTS in form of acyl groups. The chloroplastidic membrane lipid, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), was proposed to primarily offer DAG for TAG formation outside the chloroplast. This study provides valuable insights into the subcellular glycerolipidomics and unveils the acyl flux into the extra-chloroplastidic TAG in microalgae.

Abstract: The tetraspanin Tspan8 supports via associated integrins and proteases tumor progression and angiogenesis. To shed light on its activities in non-transformed cells, we generated a Tspan8 knockout (ko) mouse, comparing leukocyte migration, angiogenesis, wound healing and tumor growth with wild type, CD151ko and Tspan8/CD151ko (dbko) mice. CD151ko mice were included as CD151 activities resemble that of Tspan8, and dbko mice to exclude mutual substitution. Tspan8ko and dbko mice show no pathological phenotype. However, delayed type hypersensitivity reactions are mitigated in Tspan8ko mice, angiogenesis is severely impaired in Tspan8ko, CD151ko and dbko mice, with Tspan8 mostly affecting lymphangiogenesis. Distinct contributions of CD151 and Tspan8 to skin wound healing rely on preferentially CD151 anchoring basal keratinocytes and Tspan8 promoting motility. Proliferation of wounded skin keratinocytes is not affected. Metastasis formation of a melanoma and a Tspan8-expressing pancreatic cancer line was impaired in Tspan8ko and dbko mice, pointing towards a contribution of host Tspan8 to tumor progression. In line with the importance of tetraspanins in exosome-mediated intercellular communication, defects became mitigated by Tspan8/CD151-competent serum exosomes, which offers a most promising therapeutic option for chronic wounds and arteriosclerosis.

Abstract: Non-coding RNAs play major roles in cardiac pathophysiology. Recent studies reported that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are dysregulated in the failing heart, but how they contribute to heart failure development is unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify heart-enriched lncRNAs and investigate their regulation and function in the failing heart.
Results
Analysis of a RNA-seq dataset of 15 Caucasian tissues allowed the identification of 415 heart-enriched lncRNAs. Fifty-three lncRNAs were located on the genome in close vicinity to protein-coding genes associated with cardiac function and disease. Analysis of a second RNA-seq dataset of 16 failing human hearts highlighted one lncRNA which we arbitrarily named TRDN-AS due to its localisation in the antisense position of the gene encoding triadin (TRDN). Expression of TRDN-AS and cardiac TRDN was up-regulated in biopsies from failing human hearts compared to control hearts. In failing hearts, TRDN-AS was positively correlated with a cardiac isoform of TRDN and negatively correlated with a skeletal muscle isoform of TRDN. A murine homolog of human TRDN-AS was identified and found to be enriched in the heart and localised in the nuclear compartment of cardiomyocytes. Trdn-AS expression as well as the ratio between cardiac and skeletal muscle isoforms were down-regulated after experimental myocardial infarction. In murine cardiomyocytes, activation of Trdn-AS transcription with the CRISPR/dCas9-VPR system enhanced the ratio between cardiac and skeletal isoforms of Trdn.
Conclusion
The lncRNA TRDN-AS regulates the balance between cardiac and skeletal isoforms of triadin. This finding may have implications for the treatment of heart failure.

Abstract: Human α1D-adrenoceptors (α1D-ARs) are a group of the seven transmembrane-spanning proteins that mediate many of the physiological and pathophysiological actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Although it is known that α1D-ARs are phosphoproteins, their specific phosphorylation sites and the kinases involved in their phosphorylation remain largely unknown. Using a combination of in silico analysis, mass spectrometry and site directed mutagenesis, we identified distinct α1D-AR phosphorylation patterns during noradrenaline- or phorbol ester-mediated desensitizations. We found that the G protein coupled receptor kinase, GRK2, and conventional protein kinases C isoforms α/β, phosphorylate α1D-AR during these processes. Furthermore, we showed that the phosphorylated residues are located in the receptor's third intracellular loop (S300, S323, T328, S331, S332, S334) and carboxyl region (S441, T442, T477, S486, S492, T507, S515, S516, S518, S543) and are conserved among orthologues but are not conserved among the other human α1-adrenoceptor subtypes. Additionally, we found that phosphorylation in either the third intracellular loop or carboxyl tail was sufficient to regulate calcium signaling desensitization. By contrast, mutations in either of these two domains significantly altered mitogen activated protein kinase (ERK) pathway and receptor internalization, suggesting that they have differential regulatory mechanisms. Our data provide new insights into the functional repercussions of these posttranslational modifications in signaling outcomes and desensitization.

Abstract: The Cdc28 protein kinase subunits, Cks1 and Cks2, play dual roles in Cdk-substrate specificity and Cdk-independent protein degradation, in concert with the E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes SCFSkp2 and APCCdc20. Notable targets controlled by Cks include p27 and Cyclin A. Here, we demonstrate that Cks1 and Cks2 proteins interact with both the MllN and MllC subunits of Mll1 (Mixed-lineage leukaemia 1), and together, the Cks proteins define Mll1 levels throughout the cell cycle. Overexpression of CKS1B and CKS2 is observed in multiple human cancers, including various MLL-rearranged (MLLr) AML subtypes. To explore the importance of MLL-Fusion Protein regulation by CKS1/2, we used small molecule inhibitors (MLN4924 and C1) to modulate their protein degradation functions. These inhibitors specifically reduced the proliferation of MLLr cell lines compared to primary controls. Altogether, this study uncovers a novel regulatory pathway for MLL1, which may open a new therapeutic approach to MLLr leukaemia.

Abstract: Preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) is a secretory soluble protein, which exerts pleiotropic effects on maintenance of cancer stem cell characteristics and commitment of mesenchymal stem cell lineages by inhibiting adipogenesis. Observations that obesity renders the microenvironment of adipose tissues hypoxic and that hypoxia inhibits adipogenesis lead us to investigate whether hypoxia increases the expression of anti-adipogenic Pref-1 in preadipocytes, mature adipocytes, and adipose tissues from obese mouse. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, hypoxia induces Pref-1 by a hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-dependent mechanism accompanied by increase in the levels of the active histone mark, acetylated H3K9/14 (H3K9/14Ac). Adipogenesis increased the levels of the heterochromatin histone mark, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3), whereas it decreased the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K9/14Ac euchromatin marks of the mouse Pref-1 promoter. However, differently from preadipocytes, in mature adipocytes hypoxia failed to reverse the repressive epigenetic changes of Pref-1 promoter and to increase its expression. Short term (8weeks) high fat diet (HFD) increased HIF-1α protein in subcutaneous and epididymal adipose tissues, but did not increase Pref-1 expression. Unlike in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, HIF-1α did not increase Pref-1 expression in adipose tissues in which mature adipocytes constitute the main population. Interestingly, long term (35weeks) HFD increased Pref-1 in serum but not in obese adipose tissues. This study suggests that Pref-1 is an endocrine factor which is synergistically increased by obesity and age.

Abstract: Caspase activation plays a crucial role in skeletal muscle differentiation. We previously found that caspase-2 activity increases during skeletal muscle cell differentiation; however, its direct effect on differentiation has not been fully investigated. Here, we found that caspase-2 activity transiently increased more than two-fold within 24h following induction of differentiation. Both pharmacological inhibition and shRNA-mediated knockdown of caspase-2 suppressed myogenic differentiation and dramatically impaired myotube formation. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown prevented induction of p21 and altered cell cycle profiles. Interestingly, caspase-3 activity was also dramatically reduced following caspase-2 inhibition or ablation. Moreover, caspase-2 and p21 were localized to the nucleus during early differentiation. Given the nuclear localization of caspase-2 and p21, as well as the impairment in p21 induction in caspase-2 knockdown cells, we propose that the role of caspase-2 is to regulate p21 induction at the onset of differentiation, which may regulate the myogenic program. Collectively, these results highlight a novel function for caspase-2 in myocyte differentiation and myogenesis.

Abstract: Height is a complex human phenotype that is influenced by variations in a high number of genes. Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within IL11 (rs4252548) has been described to be associated with height in adults of European ancestry. This coding SNP leads to the exchange of Arg-112 to His-112 within the cytokine Interleukin-11 (IL-11), which has a well-established role in osteoclast development and bone turnover. The functional consequences of the R112H mutation are unknown so far. In this study, we show by molecular replacement that Arg-112 does not participate in binding of IL-11 to its receptors IL-11R and glycoprotein 130 (gp130). Recombinant IL-11 R112H expressed in E. coli displays a correct four-helix-bundle folding topology, and binds with similar affinity to IL-11R and the IL-11/IL-11R/gp130 complex. IL-11 R112H induces cell proliferation and phosphorylation of the downstream transcription factor STAT3 indistinguishable from IL-11. However, IL-11 R112H fails to support the survival of osteoclast progenitor cells and is less thermally stable, which is caused by the loss of the positive charge on the protein surface since protonation of the histidine side chain recovers stability.

Abstract: The histone demethylase KDM2B is an epigenetic factor with oncogenic properties that is regulated by the basic fibroblasts growth factor (FGF-2). It has recently been shown that KDM2B co-operates with Polycomb Group proteins to promote cell migration and angiogenesis in tumors. In the present study we addressed the role of KDM2B in regulating actin cytoskeleton signaling, cell-cell adhesion and migration of prostate tumor cells. We report here that KDM2B is functionally expressed in DU-145 prostate cancer cells, activated by FGF-2 and regulates EZH2. KDM2B knockdown induced potent up-regulation of gene transcription and protein expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and ZO-1, while KDM2B overexpression down-regulated the levels of both markers, suggesting control of cell adhesion by KDM2B. RhoA and RhoB protein expression and activity were diminished upon KDM2B-knockdown and upregulated in KDM2B-overexpressing cell clones. In accordance, actin reorganization with formation of stress fibers became evident in KDM2B-overexpressing cells and abolished in the presence of the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase. DU-145 cell migration was significantly enhanced in KDM2B overexpressing cells and abolished in C3-pretreated cells. Conversely, the retardation of cell migration observed in KDM2B knockdown cells was enhanced in C3-pretreated cells. These results establish a clear functional link between the epigenetic factor KDM2B and the regulation of cell adhesion and Rho-GTPases signaling that controls actin reorganization and cell migration.

Abstract: It is fully established that the condensing reaction for the initiation of fatty acid synthesis is essential for viability of many bacteria. In model bacteria such as Escherichia coli, this reaction is exclusively catalyzed by β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) III (encoded by fabH) and the FabH loss results in a fatty acid auxotroph. However, such a notion has been under the challenge of recent findings. In an attempt to resolve the conflicting results, in this study, we examined the physiological role of multiple KASIII enzyme homologues in Shewanella oneidensis, an excellent model for researching type II fatty acid synthesis (FASII) and its regulation. We demonstrated that FabH1 and temperature-responsive FabH2 are primarily responsible for initiating synthesis of straight- and branched-chain fatty acids respectively, whereas FabH3 and OleA are dispensable. Cells lacking all these enzymes as a set are viable but carry severe defects in growth. Further analyses revealed that in the absence of KASIII either of FabB (KASI) and FabF2 (KASII) is able to support growth, suggesting that they could initiate FASII. Strikingly, KASIII enzymes and OleA together confer S. oneidensis cells resistance to cerulenin, a selective inhibitor of FabF and FabB. Along with our previous finding that S. oneidensis FabF1 and FabB are fully equivalent with respect to their physiological impacts, these results imply that physiological function promiscuity of bacterial KAS enzymes could be more extensive than previously expected.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the release of amyloid beta peptides (Aβ) in the form of monomers/oligomers which may lead to oxidative stress, mitochondria dysfunction, synaptic loss, neuroinflammation and, in consequence, to overactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). However, Aβ peptides are also released in the brain ischemia, traumatic injury and in inflammatory response. PARP-1 is suggested to be a promising target in therapy of neurodegenerative disorders. We investigated the impact of PARP-1 inhibition on transcription of mitochondria-related genes in PC12 cells. Moreover, the effect of PARP-1 inhibitor (PJ34) on cells subjected to Aβ oligomers (AβO) – evoked stress was analyzed. Our data demonstrated that inhibition of PARP-1 in PC12 cells enhanced the transcription of genes for antioxidative enzymes (Sod1, Gpx1, Gpx4), activated genes regulating mitochondrial fission/fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2, Dnm1l, Opa1, Fis1), subunits of ETC complexes (mt-Nd1, Sdha, mt-Cytb) and modulated expression of several TFs, enhanced Foxo1 and decreased Nrf1, Stat6, Nfkb1. AβO elevated free radicals concentration, decreased mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) and cell viability after 24h. Gene transcription was not affected by AβO after 24h, but was significantly downregulated after 96h. In AβO stress, PJ34 exerted stimulatory effect on expression of several genes (Gpx1, Gpx4, Opa1, Mfn2, Fis1 and Sdha), decreased transcription of numerous TFs (Nrf1, Tfam, Stat3, Stat6, Trp53, Nfkb1) and prevented oxidative stress. Our results indicated that PARP-1 inhibition significantly enhanced transcription of genes involved in antioxidative defense and in regulation of mitochondria function, but was not able to ameliorate cells viability affected by Aβ.

Abstract: Several studies have revealed that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) can mediate phosphorylation of steroid receptors at multiple sites, including serine 81 of the androgen receptor (AR). Phosphorylation of S81 is required for AR nuclear translocation, an association with chromatin and also regulates endogenous AR-regulated transcription in response to hormones. Up to date, S81-phosphorylation has been studied using different CDK inhibitors. Nevertheless, most inhibitors are non-selective or have unknown selectivity. We investigated the selectivity of commercially available CDK inhibitors and identified compounds that will be suitable for further studies to identify the CDKs responsible for S81-AR phosphorylation. We confirmed the positive impact of CDK1 and CDK9 on phosphorylation of S81-AR and its transcriptional activity. Although CDK1-mediated phosphorylation was previously shown to occur during mitosis, our experiments did not confirm this finding. By using chemical and genetic inhibition techniques, we identified that CDK2 contributes to S81-AR phosphorylation and transactivation while CDK4 was not shown to be involved in this process.

Abstract: Autophagy and apoptosis are two major interconnected host cell responses to viral infection, including influenza A virus (IAV). Thus, delineating these events could facilitate the development of better treatment options and provide an effective anti-viral strategy for controlling IAV infection. We used A549 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) to study the role of virus-induced autophagy and apoptosis, the cross-talk between both pathways, and their relation to IAV infection [ATCC strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) (hereafter; PR8)]. PR8-infected and mock-infected cells were analyzed by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, electron microscopy and flow cytometry (FACS). We found that PR8 infection simultaneously induced autophagy and apoptosis in A549 cells. Autophagy was associated with Bax and Bak activation, intrinsic caspase cleavage and subsequent PARP-1 and BID cleavage. Both Bax knockout (KO) and Bax/Bak double knockout MEFs displayed inhibition of virus-induced cytopathology and cell death and diminished virus-mediated caspase activation, suggesting that virus-induced apoptosis is Bax/Bak-dependent. Biochemical inhibition of autophagy induction with 3-methyladenine blocked both virus replication and apoptosis pathways. These effects were replicated using autophagy-refractory Atg3 KO and Atg5 KO cells. Taken together, our data indicate that PR8 infection simultaneously induces autophagy and Bax/caspase-dependent apoptosis, with autophagy playing a role to support PR8 replication, in part, by modulating virus-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Lamins constitute the major architectural proteins of the nuclear lamina that help in maintaining nuclear organization. Mutations in lamins are associated with diverse degenerative diseases, collectively termed laminopathies. HECW2, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is transcriptionally upregulated in HeLa cells expressing Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy-causing-lamin A mutants. However, the role of HECW2 upregulation in mediating downstream effects in lamin mutant-expressing cells was previously unexplored. Here, we show that HECW2 interacts with two lamin A-binding proteins, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), via a canonical PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) motif, and lamin B1. HECW2 mediates their ubiquitination and targets them for proteasomal degradation. Cells expressing lamin A mutants G232E and Q294P, in which HECW2 is upregulated, show increased proteasomal degradation of PCNA and lamin B1 most likely mediated by HECW2. Our findings establish HECW2 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PCNA and lamin B1 which regulates their levels in laminopathic cells. We also found that HECW2 interacts with wild-type lamin A and ubiquitinates it and this interaction is reduced in case of lamin mutants G232E and Q294P. Our findings suggest that interplay among HECW2, lamin A, PCNA, and lamin B1 determines their respective homeostatic levels in the cell and dysregulation of these interactions may contribute to the pathogenicity of laminopathies.

Abstract: The mitotic spindle is a dynamic macromolecular complex essential for chromosome segregation. ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) proteins are emerging as relevant mitotic players putatively recruiting spindle organizers. Here, we describe that VPS28, an ESCRT-I component, directly interacts with Gβγ, a signaling heterodimer with documented impact on microtubule dynamics, composing a novel organizer of the mitotic spindle aster. We found that VPS28 localizes to mitotic microtubules where it recruits Gβγ. Reducing VPS28 expression impairs kinesin Eg5 and TPX2 localization to the mitotic spindle. The interaction between VPS28 and Gβγ involves the carboxyl-terminal region of VPS28, which usually interacts with VPS36, its regular partner at multivesicular bodies. The VPS28-Gβγ complex is better constituted in the presence of Gα independently of G protein coupled receptor-stimulation, suggesting an intrinsic mechanism of regulation by which this novel complex contributes to mitotic spindle organization in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Acquired radioresistance accompanied with increased metastatic potential is a major hurdle in effective radiotherapy of breast cancers. However, the nature of their inter-dependence and the underlying mechanism remains largely intangible. By employing radioresistant (RR) cell lines, we herein demonstrate that MCF-7 RR cells display phenotypic and molecular alterations evocative of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) with increased traction forces and membrane ruffling culminating in boosted invasiveness. We then show that these changes can be attributed to overexpression of alpha-actinin-4 (ACTN4), with ACTN4 knockdown near-completely abrogating both radioresistance and EMT-associated changes. We further found that in MCF-7 RR cells, ACTN4 mediates the observed effects by activating AKT, and downstream AKT/GSK3β signalling. Though ACTN4 plays a similar role in mediating radioresistance and invasiveness in MDA-MB-231 RR cells, co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal that these changes are effected through increased association with AKT and not by overexpression of AKT. Taken together, our study identifies ACTN4/AKT/GSK3β as a novel pathway regulating radioresistance coupled invasion which can be further explored to improve the radiotherapeutic gain.

Abstract: Adipogenesis is a process of preadipocyte differentiation that requires action of numerous factors. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) possesses the N-terminus of the PilT protein (PilT N-terminus or PIN domain) that has RNase properties. This protein degrades transcripts coding for inflammation and differentiation – related proteins. Moreover, MCPIP1 is a broad suppressor of the miRNA biogenesis. We previously found that MCPIP1 degrades transcript encoding CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Beta (C/EBPβ) and influences adipogenesis. Subsequently, we aimed to determine adipocyte miRNA expression profile in differentiating mouse preadipocytes, 3T3-L1, by overexpressing MCPIP1. Using Next-Generation Sequencing (NSG) we showed that MCPIP1 overexpression results in modulated levels of 58 miRNAs in adipocytes on day 2 of differentiation. Among them, 30 miRNAs showed significantly reduced levels and 28 showed increased levels in comparison to control. Approximately one third of the modulated miRNAs were not previously reported to be involved in adipocytes differentiation. Our analysis revealed that 24 down-regulated and 23 up-regulated miRNAs (at least 1.5-fold) influence 19 signaling pathways that are important for adipogenesis. Furthermore, reduced miRNA levels result in the up-regulation of their targets. By using luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that miR-32-5p and miR-9-3p directly target the 3′UTR region of Mapk8 and Tiam1, respectively. In addition, activation of MAP kinases pathway (JNK and p38), proposed as being regulated by down-regulated miRNAs, was higher in WTMCPIP1 than in D141NMCPIP1 or control 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results indicate a considerable impact of MCPIP1 on miRNAs levels and its significance in adipogenesis.

Abstract: An attractive possibility to treat Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a severe condition caused by dysfunctional CFTR, an epithelial anion channel, is through the activation of alternative (non-CFTR) anion channels. Anoctamin 1 (ANO1) was demonstrated to be a Ca2+-activated chloride channel (CaCC) and thus of high potential to replace CFTR. Despite that ANO1 is expressed in human lung CF tissue, it is present at the cell surface at very low levels. In addition, little is known about regulation of ANO1 traffic, namely which factors promote its plasma membrane (PM) localization. Here, we generated a novel cellular model, expressing an inducible 3HA-ANO1-eGFP construct, and validated its usage as a microscopy tool to monitor for ANO1 traffic. We demonstrate the robustness and specificity of this cell-based assay, by the identification of siRNAs acting both as ANO1 traffic enhancer and inhibitor, targeting respectively COPB1 and ESYT1 (extended synaptotagmin-1), the latter involved in coupling of the endoplasmic reticulum to the PM at specific microdomains. We further show that knockdown of ESYT1 (and family members ESYT2 and ESYT3) significantly decreased ANO1 current density. This ANO1 cell-based assay constitutes an important tool to be further used in high-throughput screens and drug discovery of high relevance for CF and cancer.

Abstract: Most cancer deaths result from metastasis, which is the dissemination of cells from a primary tumor to distant organs. Metastasis involves changes to molecules that are essential for tumor cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and to endothelial cells. Junctional Adhesion Molecule C (JAM-C) localizes at intercellular junctions as homodimers or more affine heterodimers with JAM-B. We previously showed that the homodimerization site (E66) in JAM-C is also involved in JAM-B binding. Here we show that neoexpression of JAM-C in a JAM-C-negative carcinoma cell line induced loss of adhesive property and pro-metastatic capacities. We also identify two critical structural sites (E66 and K68) for JAM-C/JAM-B interaction by directed mutagenesis of JAM-C and studied their implication on tumor cell behavior. JAM-C mutants did not bind to JAM-B or localize correctly to junctions. Moreover, mutated JAM-C proteins increased adhesion and reduced proliferation and migration of lung carcinoma cell lines. Carcinoma cells expressing mutant JAM-C grew slower than with JAM-C WT and were not able to establish metastatic lung nodules in mice. Overall these data demonstrate that the dimerization sites E66-K68 of JAM-C affected cell adhesion, polarization and migration and are essential for tumor cell metastasis.

Abstract: Chemotherapy resistance is a major problem in the treatment of cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We found that the expression levels of claudin-1 (CLDN1) and 3, tight junctional proteins, are upregulated in cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant human lung adenocarcinoma A549 (A549R) cells. A549R cells showed cross-resistance to doxorubicin (DXR). Here, the expression mechanism and function of CLDN1 and 3 were examined. CLDN1 and 3 were mainly localized at tight junctions concomitant with zonula occludens (ZO)-1, a scaffolding protein, in A549 and A549R cells. The phosphorylation levels of Src, MEK, ERK, c-Fos, and Akt in A549R cells were higher than those in A549 cells. The expression levels of CLDN1 and 3 were decreased by LY-294002, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, and BAY 11-7082, an NF-κB inhibitor. The overexpression of CLDN1 and 3 decreased the paracellular permeability of DXR in A549 cells. Hypoxia levels in A549R and CLDN1-overexpressing cells (CLDN1/A549) were greater than those in A549, mock/A549, and CLDN3/A549 cells in a spheroid culture model. In contrast, accumulation in the region inside the spheroids and the toxicity of DXR in A549R and CLDN1/A549 cells were lower than those in other cells. Furthermore, the accumulation and toxicity of DXR were rescued by CLDN1 siRNA in A549R cells. We suggest that CLDN1 is upregulated by CDDP resistance through activation of a PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway, resulting in the inhibition of penetration of anticancer drugs into the inner area of spheroids.

Abstract: Anandamide, the first identified endogenous cannabinoid and TRPV1 agonist, is one of a series of endogenous N-acylethanolamines, NAEs. We have generated novel assays to quantify the levels of multiple NAEs in biological tissues and their rates of hydrolysis through fatty acid amide hydrolase. This range of NAEs was also tested in rapid response assays of CB1, CB2 cannabinoid and TRPV1 receptors. The data indicate that PEA, SEA and OEA are not endocannabinoids or endovanilloids, and that the higher endogenous levels of these metabolites compared to polyunsaturated analogues are a correlate of their slow rates of hydrolysis. The n−6 NAEs (AEA, docosatetraenoyl and docosapentaenoyl derivatives) activated both CB1 and CB2 receptors, as well as TRPV1 channels, suggesting them to be ‘genuine’ endocannabinoids and ‘endovanilloids’. The n−3 NAEs (eicosapentaenoyl, docosapentaenoyl and docosahexaenoyl derivatives) activated CB2 receptors and some n−3 NAEs (docosapentaenoyl and docosahexaenoyl derivatives) also activated TRPV1 channels, but failed to activate the CB1 receptor. We hypothesise that the preferential activation of CB2 receptors by n−3 PUFA NAEs contributes, at least in some part, to their broad anti-inflammatory profile.

Abstract: The relevance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in cancer process is still unknown. Since the mutagenesis of mitochondrial genome in mammals is not possible yet, we have exploited budding yeast S. cerevisiae as a model to study the effects of tumor-associated mutations in the mitochondrial MTATP6 gene, encoding subunit 6 of ATP synthase, on the energy metabolism. We previously reported that four mutations in this gene have a limited impact on the production of cellular energy. Here we show that two mutations, Atp6-P163S and Atp6-K90E (human MTATP6-P136S and MTATP6-K64E, found in prostate and thyroid cancer samples, respectively), increase sensitivity of yeast cells both to compounds inducing oxidative stress and to high concentrations of calcium ions in the medium, when Om45p, the component of porin complex in outer mitochondrial membrane (OM), was fused to GFP. In OM45-GFP background, these mutations affect the activation of yeast permeability transition pore (yPTP, also called YMUC, yeast mitochondrial unspecific channel) upon calcium induction. Moreover, we show that calcium addition to isolated mitochondria heavily induced the formation of ATP synthase dimers and oligomers, recently proposed to form the core of PTP, which was slower in the mutants. We show the genetic evidence for involvement of mitochondrial ATP synthase in calcium homeostasis and permeability transition in yeast. This paper is a first to show, although in yeast model organism, that mitochondrial ATP synthase mutations, which accumulate during carcinogenesis process, may be significant for cancer cell escape from apoptosis.

The prostaglandin EP4 receptor is a master regulator of the expression of PGE2 receptors following inflammatory activation in human monocytic cells,

Abstract: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is responsible for inflammatory symptoms. However, PGE2 also suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production. There are at least 4 subtypes of PGE2 receptors, EP1–EP4, but it is unclear which of these specifically control cytokine production. The aim of this study was to determine which of the different receptors, EP1R–EP4R modulate production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in human monocytic cells. Human blood, or the human monocytic cell line THP-1 were stimulated with LPS. The actions of PGE2, alongside selective agonists of EP1–EP4 receptors, were assessed on LPS-induced TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 release. The expression profiles of EP2R and EP4R in monocytes and THP-1 cells were characterised by RT-qPCR. In addition, the production of cytokines was evaluated following knockdown of the receptors using siRNA and over-expression of the receptors by transfection with constructs. PGE2 and also EP2 and EP4 agonists (but not EP1 or EP3 agonists) suppressed TNF-α production in blood and THP-1 cells. LPS also up regulated expression of EP2R and EP4R but not EP1 or EP3. siRNA for either EP2R or EP4R reversed the suppressive actions of PGE2 on cytokine production and overexpression of EP2R and EP4R enhanced the suppressive actions of PGE2. This indicates that PGE2 suppression of TNF-α by human monocytic cells occurs via EP2R and EP4R expression. However EP4Rs also control their own expression and that of EP2 whereas the EP2R does not affect EP4R expression. This implies that EP4 receptors have an important master role in controlling inflammatory responses.

Abstract: The proteoglycan nerve/glial antigen (NG) 2 is expressed on multiple cell types and mediates cell proliferation and migration. However, little is known about its function in gene regulation. In this study, we demonstrate that in pericytes and glioblastoma cells intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, an essential protein for leukocyte adhesion and transmigration, underlies a NG2-dependent expression. As shown by flow cytometry, Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), silencing of NG2 in human placenta-derived pericytes increased the expression of ICAM-1. Pathway analyses revealed that this is mediated by extracellular-regulated-kinases (ERK) 1/2 signaling. Moreover, leukocyte adhesion to NG2 siRNA-treated pericytes was significantly enhanced when compared to scrambled (scr) siRNA-treated control cells. In vivo, we detected increased ICAM-1 protein levels in the retina of mice lacking NG2 expression. To exclude that this novel mechanism is pericyte-specific, we additionally analyzed the expression of ICAM-1 in dependency of NG2 in two glioblastoma cell lines. We found that A1207 and M059K cells exhibit an inverse expression pattern of NG2 and ICAM-1. Finally, downregulation of NG2 in A1207 cells significantly increased ICAM-1 expression. Taken together, these findings indicate that NG2 may represent a promising target for the modulation of ICAM-1-mediated immune responses.

Abstract: The failure of chemotherapeutic drugs in treatment of various cancers is attributed to the acquisition of drug resistance. However, the migration mechanisms of drug-resistant cancer cells remain incompletely understood. Here we address this question from a biophysical perspective by mapping the phenotypic alterations in ovarian cancer cells (OCCs) resistant to cisplatin and paclitaxel. We show that cisplatin-resistant (CisR), paclitaxel-resistant (PacR) and dual drug-resistant (i.e., resistant to both drugs) OCCs are more contractile and softer than drug-sensitive cells. Protease inhibition suppresses invasion of CisR cells but not of PacR cells, indicative of a protease-dependent mode of migration in CisR cells and a protease-independent mode of migration in PacR. Despite these differences, actomyosin contractility, mediated by the RhoA-ROCK2-Myosin II signaling pathway, regulates both modes of migration. Confined migration experiments establish the role of myosin IIA and IIB in mediating nuclear translocation and regulation of proteolytic activity. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of myosin II as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells.

Abstract: Tumor cell can be significantly influenced by various chemical groups of the extracellular matrix proteins. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between cancer cells and functional groups in the extracellular matrix remain unknown. Using chemically modified surfaces with biological functional groups (CH3, NH2, OH), it was found that hydrophobic surfaces modified with CH3 and NH2 suppressed cell proliferation and induced the number of apoptotic cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome c release, Bax upregulation, cleaved caspase-3 and PARP, and Bcl-2 downregulation indicated that hydrophobic surfaces with CH3 and NH2 triggered the activation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. Cells on the CH3- and NH2-modified hydrophobic surfaces showed downregulated expression and activation of integrin β1, with a subsequent decrease of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity. The RhoA/ROCK/PTEN signaling was then activated to inhibit the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, which are essential for cell proliferation. However, pretreatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with SF1670, a PTEN inhibitor, abolished the hydrophobic surface-induced activation of the intrinsic pathway. Taken together, the present results indicate that CH3- and NH2-modified hydrophobic surfaces induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by suppressing the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, but not OH surfaces. These findings are helpful to understand the interaction between extracellular matrix and cancer cells, which might provide new insights into the mechanism potential intervention strategies for tumor prognosis.
