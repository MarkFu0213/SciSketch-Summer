Abstract: The forkhead transcription factor FoxP3 is critically involved in the development and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that populate tumors and are considered as powerful parts of their immune evasion. However, also tumor cells are reported to express FoxP3. Since gliomas are particularly immunosuppressive tumors, we investigated the occurrence and possible functions of FoxP3 in these malignant cells. By quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and FACS analysis, we detected FoxP3 in glioma cells in situ and in vitro. After exposure of glioma cell lines to chemotherapeutics, expression of FoxP3 was significantly enhanced, and it was dislocated from more nuclear to perinuclear localization. Overexpression of FoxP3 in glioma cell lines considerably favored apoptotic damage of nuclei, DNA fragmentation, increased cleavage of the pro-apoptotic enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and basal activities of effector caspases-3/7. In FoxP3-transfected cells, apoptotic stimuli like Camptothecin, Temozolomide or tumor necrosis factor-α synergistically enhanced caspases-3/7-activities over controls. Taking together, FoxP3 occurs in glioma cells, is induced by chemotherapeutics, and its expression is correlated with increased apoptosis of glioma cells, especially when propagated by apoptotic stimuli. Thus, FoxP3 is a novel pro-apoptotic transcription factor in gliomas that is critically involved in the action of apoptotic agents.

Abstract: The trimeric SNF1 complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a homolog of mammalian AMP-activated kinase, has been primarily implicated in signaling for the utilization of alternative carbon sources to glucose. We here find that snf1 deletion mutants are hypersensitive to different cell wall stresses, such as the presence of Calcofluor white, Congo red, Zymolyase or the glucan synthase inhibitor Caspofungin in the growth medium. They also have a thinner cell wall. Caspofungin treatment triggers the phosphorylation of the catalytic Snf1 kinase subunit at Thr210 and removal of this phosphorylation site by mutagenesis (Snf1-T210A) abolishes the function of Snf1 in cell wall integrity. Deletion of the PFK1 gene encoding the α-subunit of the heterooctameric yeast phosphofructokinase suppresses the cell wall phenotypes of a snf1 deletion, which suggests a compensatory effect of central carbohydrate metabolism. Epistasis analyses with mutants in cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling confirm that the SNF1 complex and the CWI pathway independently affect yeast cell integrity.

Abstract: This work deals with the role of myosin phosphorylation in anaphase chromosome movement. Y27632 and ML7 block two different pathways for phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC). Both stopped or slowed chromosome movement when added to anaphase crane-fly spermatocytes. To confirm that the effects of the pharmacological agents were on the presumed targets, we studied cells stained with antibodies against mono- or bi-phosphorylated myosin. For all chromosomes whose movements were affected by a drug, the corresponding spindle fibres of the affected chromosomes had reduced levels of 1P- and 2P-myosin. Thus the drugs acted on the presumed target and myosin phosphorylation is involved in anaphase force production. Calyculin A, an inhibitor of MRLC dephosphorylation, reversed and accelerated the altered movements caused by Y27632 and ML-7, suggesting that another phosphorylation pathway is involved in phosphorylation of spindle myosin. Staurosporine, a more general phosphorylation inhibitor, also reduced the levels of MRLC phosphorylation and caused anaphase chromosomes to stop or slow. The effects of staurosporine on chromosome movements were not reversed by Calyculin A, confirming that another phosphorylation pathway is involved in phosphorylation of spindle myosin.

Abstract: Background
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a complex disease and several inherited and acquired factors are relevant to its occurrence. Among these, an elevated level of plasma coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is an established risk factor for VTE; copy number variations (CNVs) have also been discovered to be associated with many diseases.
Objective
To explore the proposed association between CNV of the F8 gene and the risk of VTE.
Methods
A case–control study including 179 VTE patients and 176 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Activity of plasma factor VIII was measured. Genomic DNA was extracted for subsequent quantitative real-time PCR analysis of CNVs of the F8 gene.
Results
Plasma factor VIII levels were significantly higher in VTE patients than in healthy controls (251% vs. 99%, p<0.01). Copy number of the F8 gene in VTE patients was significantly higher than in healthy controls. (male: p=6.1×10−14, OR=12, 95%CI: 6.0–25; female: p=4.3×10−10, OR=9.5, 95%CI: 4.5–20). Plasma factor VIII levels in the samples with high copies of the F8 gene were higher than in those individuals with normal copy number (male: p=0.023; female: p=0.036).
Conclusions
Amplification of the F8 gene copy number seems to enhance factor VIII activity and was associated with VTE.

Abstract: Absract
HES6, a member of the hairy-enhancer-of-split family of transcription factors, plays multiple roles in myogenesis. It is a direct target of the myogenic transcription factor MyoD and has been shown to regulate the formation of the myotome in development, myoblast cell cycle exit and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton during terminal differentiation. Here we investigate the expression and function of HES6 in rhabdomyosarcoma, a soft tissue tumor which expresses myogenic genes but fails to differentiate into muscle. We show that HES6 is expressed at high levels in the subset of alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas expressing PAX/FOXO1 fusion genes (ARMSp). Knockdown of HES6 mRNA in the ARMSp cell line RH30 reduces proliferation and cell motility. This phenotype is rescued by expression of mouse Hes6 which is insensitive to HES6 siRNA. Furthermore, expression microarray analysis indicates that the HES6 knockdown is associated with a decrease in the levels of Transgelin, (TAGLN), a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. Knockdown of TAGLN decreases cell motility, whilst TAGLN overexpression rescues the motility defect resulting from HES6 knockdown. These findings indicate HES6 contributes to the pathogenesis of ARMSp by enhancing both proliferation and cell motility.

Abstract: Summary
Death receptors (DRs) of the TNFR superfamily contribute to antiviral immunity by promoting apoptosis and regulating immune homeostasis during infection, and viral inhibition of DR signaling can alter immune defenses. Here we identify the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL141 glycoprotein as necessary and sufficient to restrict TRAIL DR function. Despite showing no primary sequence homology to TNF family cytokines, UL141 binds the ectodomains of both human TRAIL DRs with affinities comparable to the natural ligand TRAIL. UL141 binding promotes intracellular retention of the DRs, thus protecting virus infected cells from TRAIL and TRAIL-dependent NK cell-mediated killing. The identification of UL141 as a herpesvirus modulator of the TRAIL DRs strongly implicates this pathway as a regulator of host defense to HCMV and highlights UL141 as a pleiotropic inhibitor of NK cell effector function.

Abstract: We evaluated clinical and safety outcomes in adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease receiving miglustat in clinical practice settings. An observational, retrospective cohort study was conducted in centers across the EU and the USA. Medical chart data were collected from consecutive patients between the 20th November 2002 and 31st December 2008. A total of 115 patients were included; 34 (30%) were enzyme replacement therapy-naïve (‘naïve’) and 81 (70%) were enzyme pretreated (‘pretreated’). Median (range) miglustat exposures in these groups were 15.1 (0.6–52.9)months and 15.2 (0.3–62.1)months, respectively. Low numbers of patients were anemic (10/101) or thrombocytopenic (21/101) at initiation of miglustat therapy. The median (range) hemoglobin concentration at miglustat initiation was 12.8 (10.2–16.4)g/dl in naïve patients and 13.6 (7.3–17.4)g/dl in pretreated patients; median (range) changes in hemoglobin were 0.3 (−2.5–3.6) and −0.3 (−4–4.6)g/dl, respectively. The median (range) platelet counts at miglustat initiation were 101 (37–730)×109/l in naïve patients and 173 (43–382)×109/l in pretreated patients; median (range) changes in platelet count were 8 (−77–145)×109/l and −10 (−144–434)×109/l, respectively. Plasma chitotriosidase was substantially reduced in naïve but not in pretreated patients. Organ volumes were not routinely monitored. Forty-nine (43%) patients discontinued miglustat; most due to gastrointestinal manifestations and some due to tremor. Overall, hemoglobin and platelet counts tended to increase in naïve patients treated with miglustat, and to remain stable or decrease slightly in pretreated patients. The profile of safety and tolerability observed with miglustat in the current study is similar to previous studies.

Abstract: Fibrotic diseases are a group of pathologies with high incidence and mortality. Despite extensive research efforts, effective therapies are still not available. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving the onset, progression and possible resolution of fibrosis is a prerequisite to the development of successful therapies. The central role of the TGF-β pathway and myofibroblasts in the pathogenesis of fibrosis is now generally accepted. The possible mechanisms of myofibroblast elimination or dedifferentiation, on the other hand, are still almost uncharted territory. Here we show that sustained expression of some components of MAPK signaling pathway (PDGFB, Ha-Ras(G12V) or the transcription factor EGR4) in primary chicken embryo dermal myofibroblasts results in a loss of autocrine TGF-β signaling and suppression of the myofibroblastic phenotype, characterized by the loss of alpha smooth muscle actin fibers and a substantial reduction in the production of extracellular matrix. Detailed analysis of the possible molecular mechanisms employed by EGR4 revealed FOXG1, BAMBI, NAB1, NAB2 and DUSP5 genes forming an EGR4 regulated network counteracting autocrine TGF-β signaling. We have also found that a combination of chemical inhibition of TGF-β signaling and perturbation of MAPK signaling with phorbol ester mimics the anti-fibrotic effects of PDGFB, Ha-Ras(G12V) and EGR4.

Abstract: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II, a recessive disorder of erythroid differentiation, is due to mutations in SEC23B, a component of the core trafficking machinery COPII. In no case homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for nonsense mutation(s) was found. This study represents the first description of molecular mechanisms underlying SEC23B hypomorphic genotypes by the analysis of five novel mutations. Our findings suggest that reduction of SEC23B gene expression is not associated with CDA II severe clinical presentation; conversely, the combination of a hypomorphic allele with one functionally altered results in more severe phenotypes. We propose a mechanism of compensation SEC23A-mediated which justifies these observations.

Abstract: Archaeal and eukaryotic cytosols contain group II chaperonins, which have a double-barrel structure and fold proteins inside a cavity in an ATP-dependent manner. The most complex of the chaperonins, the eukaryotic TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC), has eight different subunits, chaperone containing TCP-1 (CCT1–8), that are arranged so that there is one of each subunit per ring. Aspects of the structure and function of the bovine and yeast TRiC have been characterized, but studies of human TRiC have been limited. We have isolated and purified endogenous human TRiC from HeLa suspension cells. This purified human TRiC contained all eight CCT subunits organized into double-barrel rings, consistent with what has been found for bovine and yeast TRiC. The purified human TRiC is active as demonstrated by the luciferase refolding assay. As a more stringent test, the ability of human TRiC to suppress the aggregation of human γD-crystallin was examined. In addition to suppressing off-pathway aggregation, TRiC was able to assist the refolding of the crystallin molecules, an activity not found with the lens chaperone, α-crystallin. Additionally, we show that human TRiC from HeLa cell lysate is associated with the heat shock protein 70 and heat shock protein 90 chaperones. Purification of human endogenous TRiC from HeLa cells will enable further characterization of this key chaperonin, required for the reproduction of all human cells.

Abstract: Reversing brain degeneration and trauma lesions will depend on cell therapy. Our previous work identified neural precursor cells derived from the skeletal muscle of Nestin-GFP transgenic mice, but their identity, origin, and potential survival in the brain are only vaguely understood. In this work, we show that Nestin-GFP+ progenitor cells share morphological and molecular markers with NG2-glia, including NG2, PDGFRα, O4, NGF receptor (p75), glutamate receptor-1(AMPA), and A2B5 expression. Although these cells exhibit NG2, they do not express other pericyte markers, such as α-SMA or connexin-43, and do not differentiate into the muscle lineage. Patch-clamp studies displayed outward potassium currents, probably carried through Kir6.1 channels. Given their potential therapeutic application, we compared their abundance in tissues and concluded that skeletal muscle is the richest source of predifferentiated neural precursor cells. We found that these cells migrate toward the neurogenic subventricular zone displaying their typical morphology and nestin-GFP expression two weeks after brain injection. For translational purposes, we sought to identify these neural progenitor cells in wild-type species by developing a DsRed expression vector under Nestin-Intron II control. This approach revealed them in nonhuman primates and aging rodents throughout the lifespan.

Abstract: Gö6976 is a nonglycosidic indolocarbazole compound widely used as a specific inhibitor of PKCα/β. In experiments probing for a role of PKCα in human laminin-2-integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading of PC12 cells, we observed unexpected enhancements of adhesion, spreading and stress fiber formation to 1μM Gö6976 with concomitant increase in membrane translocation of PKCδ and autophosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Importantly, enhanced cellular behavior and membrane translocation of PKCδ induced by Gö6976 was retained in siRNA-transfected PC12 cells to knockdown PKCα expression. Gö6976 also induced laminin-dependent cell adhesion in NIH/3T3 and CV-1 fibroblasts, suggesting of a mechanism that may be common to multiple cell-types. A specific inhibitor of PKCδ, rottlerin, completely abrogated Gö6976-dependent increase in PC12 cell adhesion to laminin as well as the activation of small GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42, that are downstream of PKCδ in adhesion receptor signaling. siRNA knockdown of Rac1 and Cdc42 expression inhibited cell spreading and lamellipodia formation in PC12 cells. Overall, these results suggest that Gö6976 may stimulate membrane recruitment of PKCδ through a mechanism that is independent of PKCα/β signaling. In addition, the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 by human laminin-2-integrin-dependent activation of PKCδ/FAK signaling mediates cell spreading and lamellipodia formation in PC12 cells.

Abstract: Fibroblast growth factor 8b (FGF8b) is the major isoform of FGF8 expressed in prostate cancer and it correlates with the stage and grade of the disease. FGF8b has been considered as a potential target for prostate cancer therapy. Here we isolated 12 specific FGF8b-binding phage clones by screening a phage display heptapeptide library with FGF8b. The peptide (HSQAAVP, named as P12) corresponding to one of these clones showed high homology to the immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain II(D2) of high-affinity FGF8b receptor (FGFR3c), contained 3 identical amino acids (AVP) to the authentic FGFR3 D2 sequence aa 163–169 (LLAVPAA) directly participating in ligand binding, carried the same charges as its corresponding motif (aa163–169) in FGFR3c, suggesting that P12 may have a greater potential to interrupt FGF8b binding to its receptors than other identified heptapeptides do. Functional analysis indicated that synthetic P12 peptides mediate significant inhibition of FGF8b-induced cell proliferation, arrest cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase via suppression of Cyclin D1 and PCNA, and blockade of the activations of Erk1/2 and Akt cascades in both prostate cancer cells and vascular endothelial cells. The results demonstrated that the P12 peptide acting as an FGF8b antagonist may have therapeutic potential in prostate cancer.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the leading cause of deaths in women around the world. Resistance to therapy is the main cause of treatment failure and still little is known about predictive biomarkers for response to systemic therapy. Increasing evidence show that Survivin and XIAP overexpression is closely associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis in breast cancer. However, their impact on resistance to doxorubicin (dox), a chemotherapeutic agent widely used to treat breast cancer, is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that dox inhibited cell viability and induced DNA fragmentation and activation of caspases-3, -7 and -9 in the breast cancer-derived cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, regardless of different p53 status. Dox exposure resulted in reduction of Survivin and XIAP mRNA and protein levels. However, when we transfected cells with a Survivin-encoding plasmid, we did not observe a cell death-resistant phenotype. XIAP and Survivin silencing, either alone or in combination, had no effect on breast cancer cells sensitivity towards dox. Altogether, we demonstrated that breast cancer cells are sensitive to the chemotherapeutic agent dox irrespective of Survivin and XIAP expression levels. Also, our findings suggest that dox-mediated modulation of Survivin and XIAP might sensitize cells to taxanes when used in a sequential regimen.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) is often accompanied with metabolic disorders and insufficient energy production. Some previous studies have suggested an elevated serum free fatty acid (FA) due to chronic adrenergic stimulation induces myocardial insulin-resistance, which further impairs myocardial energy production. Because little is known about the pathogenesis of FA-induced cardiac insulin-resistance, we established an ex vivo cardiac insulin-resistant model and investigated the relationship between insulin-resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction. The ex vivo insulin-resistant myocytes, which was produced by treating differentiated H9c2 myocytes with palmitate (saturated FA; 0.2mM) for 24h, exhibited insulin-signaling deficiency and attenuated 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) uptake. When myocytes were pretreated with Mn(III)tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin pentachloride (TMPyP, a ROS scavenger; 200μM), the insulin-signaling deficiency by palmitate was restored, whereas the attenuated 2-DG uptake was remained. In contrast to TMPyP, the pretreatment with perhexiline (a mitochondrial FA uptake inhibitor; 2μM) restored the insulin-signaling deficiency and the attenuated 2-DG uptake by palmitate. Perhexiline restored the depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and the reduced intracellular ATP by palmitate, and thereby improved the impaired GLUT4 recruitment to plasma membrane after insulin, whereas TMPyP failed to do so. These results suggested that the mitochondrial dysfunction by saturated FA loading and consequent intracellular energy shortage induced myocardial insulin-resistance in our ex vivo insulin-resistant model.

Abstract: Endothelial progenitor cells circulating in the peripheral blood (PB) contribute to vascular repair. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of a ‘cocktail’ consisting of erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and tetrahydrobiopterin to mobilize hematopoietic lineage negative/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 positive (Lin−/VEGF-R2+) cells from the bone marrow (BM) to PB in non-diabetic and diabetic mice. Diabetes was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Diabetic mice were studied after 16weeks of hyperglycemia. Half the mice in each group (non-diabetic and diabetic) received daily intraperitoneal injections of the cocktail for 6 consecutive days while the other half received vehicle buffer. Mobilization of Lin−/VEGF-R2+ cells, which were expanded in MCP301 medium, was evaluated after isolating them from BM and PB and their phenotypic and morphological properties were studied. We found that 16weeks of diabetes affected neither the total number of BM mononucleated cells nor the number of Lin−/VEGF-R2+ cells in BM compared with non-diabetic controls. In non-diabetic mice, cocktail treatment resulted in a significant decrease in BM Lin−/VEGF-R2+ cells, paralleled by a significant increase of these cells in PB. Such changes in the number of Lin−/VEGF-R2+ cells in BM and PB after the cocktail treatment were less marked in diabetic mice. In vitro studies of BM Lin−/VEGF-R2+ cells from diabetic and non-diabetic mice did not reveal any differences in either phenotypes or colony forming potential. These findings indicate that diabetes impairs the mobilization of Lin−/VEGF-R2+ cells from BM to PB. Impaired mobilization of BM Lin−/VEGF-R2+ cells soon after the onset of diabetes may contribute to complications such as diabetic retinopathy.

Abstract: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an important mediator of cardiac survival pathways. Reduced levels of STAT3 in patients with end-stage heart failure suggest a clinical relevance of STAT3 deficiency for cardiac disease. The recent identification of STAT3 as a mitochondrial protein which is important for full activity of mitochondrial complex I has opened a new field for the investigation of how STAT3 functions in cardioprotection. The goal of this study was to establish a cell culture model with a reduced STAT3 expression, and to use this model for the investigation of mitochondrial and mitochondrial-associated functions under STAT3 deficiency. In the murine cardiomyogenic cell line HL-1, the expression of STAT3 was silenced by lentiviral transduction with anti-STAT3 shRNA (STAT3 KD cells). STAT3 mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in HL-1 STAT3 KD cells compared to HL-1 cells transduced with a control shRNA. Spectrophotometric and polarographic assays with mitochondrial enriched fractions and intact cells showed reduced activities of respiratory chain complexes I, II, III and IV in HL-1 STAT3 KD cells. At ultrastructural level, a severe damage of mitochondrial integrity was observed, combined with a significant increase in autophagolysosomes in STAT3-deficient HL-1 cells. Our results demonstrate that the HL-1 STAT3 KD cell line is a good model to study cellular consequences of STAT3 deficiency. Moreover, this is the first study to show that STAT3 deficiency leads to a disruption of mitochondrial ultrastructure and increased autophagy.

Abstract: Epidemiological studies report a negative association between circulating bilirubin concentrations and the risk for cancer and cardiovascular disease. Structurally related tetrapyrroles also possess in vitro anti-genotoxic activity and may prevent mutation prior to malignancy. Furthermore, few data suggest that tetrapyrroles exert anti-carcinogenic effects via induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To further investigate whether tetrapyrroles provoke DNA-damage in human cancer cells, they were tested in the single cell gel electrophoresis assay (SCGE). Eight tetrapyrroles (unconjugated bilirubin, bilirubin ditaurate, biliverdin, biliverdin-/bilirubin dimethyl ester, urobilin, stercobilin and protoporphyrin) were added to cultured Caco2 and HepG2 cells and their effects on comet formation (% tail DNA) were assessed. Flow cytometric assessment (apoptosis/necrosis, cell cycle, intracellular radical species generation) assisted in revealing underlying mechanisms of intracellular action. Cells were incubated with tetrapyrroles at concentrations of 0.5, 5 and 17μM for 24h. Addition of 300μM tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide to cells served as a positive control. Tetrapyrrole incubation mostly resulted in increased DNA-damage (comet formation) in Caco2 and HepG2 cells. Tetrapyrroles that are concentrated within the intestine, including protoporphyrin, urobilin and stercobilin, led to significant comet formation in both cell lines, implicating the compounds in inducing DNA-damage and apoptosis in cancer cells found within organs of the digestive system.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of β-glucocerebrosidase. Storage of glucosylceramide in reticuloendothelial cells results in multiorgan pathology including bone disease. Established skeletal disease may remain problematic despite Gaucher-specific treatment. Both osteopenia and osteonecrosis have been described but the underlying pathophysiology, in particular the role of monocyte-derived osteoclasts is not well defined. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of glucocerebrosidase deficiency, inhibition and replacement on osteoclast development and function. In cultures derived from GD patients, or where GBA was chemically inhibited multinucleate giant cells expressing markers of osteoclast differentiation occurred earlier and in greater numbers compared to normal controls and the functional capacity of osteoclasts for bone resorption was enhanced. Increases in osteoclast number and activity correlated with radiological markers of active bone disease. Abnormalities were reversed by addition of specific therapies and were attenuated by co-culture with cells derived from healthy controls (HCs). Numbers of osteoblast lineage cells in the peripheral blood were mismatched to osteoclast precursors indicating uncoupling of osteoblast–osteoclast regulation which may further impact on bone remodelling. Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of these changes will suggest rational therapies for the most disabling aspect of this condition.

Abstract: We have previously identified exosomes as the paracrine factor secreted by mesenchymal stem cells. Recently, we found that the key features of reperfusion injury, namely loss of ATP/NADH, increased oxidative stress and cell death were underpinned by proteomic deficiencies in ischemic/reperfused myocardium, and could be ameliorated by proteins in exosomes. To test this hypothesis in vivo, mice (C57Bl6/J) underwent 30min ischemia, followed by reperfusion (I/R injury). Purified exosomes or saline was administered 5min before reperfusion. Exosomes reduced infarct size by 45% compared to saline treatment. Langendorff experiments revealed that intact but not lysed exosomes enhanced viability of the ischemic/reperfused myocardium. Exosome treated animals exhibited significant preservation of left ventricular geometry and contractile performance during 28days follow-up. Within an hour after reperfusion, exosome treatment increased levels of ATP and NADH, decreased oxidative stress, increased phosphorylated-Akt and phosphorylated-GSK-3β, and reduced phosphorylated-c-JNK in ischemic/reperfused hearts. Subsequently, both local and systemic inflammation were significantly reduced 24h after reperfusion. In conclusion, our study shows that intact exosomes restore bioenergetics, reduce oxidative stress and activate pro-survival signaling, thereby enhancing cardiac function and geometry after myocardial I/R injury. Hence, mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes are a potential adjuvant to reperfusion therapy for myocardial infarction.

Abstract: The embryonic dorsal aorta plays a pivotal role in the production of the first hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the founders of the adult hematopoietic system. HSC production is polarized by being restricted to the aortic floor where a specialized subset of endothelial cells (ECs) endowed with hemogenic properties undergo an endothelial-to-hematopoietic production resulting in the formation of the intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters. This production is tightly time- and space-controlled with the transcription factor Runx1 playing a key role in this process and the surrounding tissues controlling the aortic shape and fate. In this paper, we shall review (a) how hemogenic ECs differentiate from the mesoderm, (b) how the different aortic components assemble coordinately to establish the dorso-ventral polarity, and (c) how this results in the initiation of Runx1 expression in hemogenic ECs and the initiation of the hematopoietic program. These observations should elucidate the first steps in HSC commitment and help in developing techniques to manipulate adult HSCs.

N-ethylmaleimide activates a Cl−-independent component of K+ flux in mouse erythrocytes,

Abstract: The K–Cl cotransporters (KCCs) of mouse erythrocytes exhibit higher basal activity than those of human erythrocytes, but are similarly activated by cell swelling, by hypertonic urea, and by staurosporine. However, the dramatic stimulation of human erythroid KCCs by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) is obscured in mouse erythrocytes by a prominent NEM-stimulated K+ efflux that lacks Cl−-dependence. The NEM-sensitivity of Cl−-independent K+ efflux of mouse erythrocytes is lower than that of KCC. The genetically engineered absence of the K–Cl cotransporters KCC3 and KCC1 from mouse erythrocytes does not modify Cl−-independent K+ efflux. Mouse erythrocytes genetically devoid of the Gardos channel KCNN4 show increased NEM-sensitivity of both Cl−-independent K+ efflux and K–Cl cotransport. The increased NEM-sensitivity and stimulation magnitude of Cl−-independent K+ efflux in mouse erythrocytes expressing transgenic hypersickling human hemoglobin SAD (HbSAD) are independent of the presence of KCC3 and KCC1, but absence of KCNN4 reduces the stimulatory effect of HbSAD. NEM-stimulated Cl−-independent K+ efflux of mouse red cells is insensitive to ouabain and bumetanide, but partially inhibited by chloroquine, barium, and amiloride. The NEM-stimulated activity is modestly reduced at pH6.0 but not significantly altered at pH8.0, and is abolished at 0°C. Although the molecular identity of this little-studied K+ efflux pathway of mouse erythrocytes remains unknown, its potential role in the pathophysiology of sickle red cell dehydration will be important for the extrapolation of studies in mouse models of sickle cell disease to our understanding of humans with sickle cell anemia.

Abstract: Wild type (WT) activated protein C (APC) and cytoprotective-selective APC variants such as 3K3A-APC (<10% anticoagulant but normal cytoprotective activity) are neuroprotective in murine focal ischemic stroke models. Here we compared the neuroprotective effects of the anticoagulant-selective E149A-APC variant (>3-fold increased anticoagulant activity but defective cytoprotective activities) to those of the cytoprotective-selective 5A-APC variant (<10% anticoagulant activity). After transient distal middle cerebral artery occlusion, mice received a vehicle, E149A-APC or 5A-APC at 0.2mg/kg at 4h after stroke. Treatment with 5A-APC was neuroprotective, as it improved performance on forelimb use asymmetry test and foot fault test (P<0.05), reduced by 48% and 50% the infarct and edema volumes, respectively (P<0.05), and was not associated with an increased risk of bleeding as indicated by normal hemoglobin levels in the ischemic brain at day 7. In contrast, E149A-APC treatment worsened neurological outcome determined by foot fault tests and forelimb use asymmetry tests, and increased significantly by 44% and 60% infarct and edema volume, respectively (P<0.05). At 7days after treatment, E149A-APC compared to vehicle or 5A-APC notably increased by ~5-fold the hemoglobin level in the ischemic hemisphere suggesting it provoked significant intracerebral bleeding. Thus, the enhanced anticoagulant activity of E149A-APC increased post-ischemic accumulation of neurotoxic erythrocyte-derived hemoglobin which likely worsened the neurological and neuropathological outcomes after stroke. Our data emphasize that APC's cytoprotective activities, but not its anticoagulant activity, are key for APC neuroprotection after transient ischemic stroke.

Abstract: Hyperprolinemia is an inherited disorder of proline (Pro) metabolism and patients affected by this disease may present neurological manifestations. However, the mechanisms of neural excitotoxicity elicited by hyperprolinemia are far from being understood. Considering the pivotal role of cytoskeletal remodeling in several neurodegenerative pathologies and the potential links between cytoskeleton, reactive oxygen species production and cell death, the aim of the present work was to study the effects of Pro on astrocyte and neuron cytoskeletal remodeling and the possible oxidative stress involvement. Pro induced a shift of actin cytoskeleton in stress fibers together with increased RhoA immunocontent and ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation in cortical astrocytes. Unlike astrocytes, results evidenced little susceptibility of neuron cytoskeleton remodeling, since Pro-treated neurons presented unaltered neuritogenesis. We observed increased hydrogen peroxide production characterizing oxidative stress together with decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in cortical astrocytes after Pro treatment, while glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) activity remained unaltered. However, coincubation with Pro and Trolox/melatonin prevented decreased SOD and CAT activities in Pro-treated astrocytes. Accordingly, these antioxidants were able to prevent the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, RhoA increased levels and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to high Pro exposure. Taken together, these findings indicated that the cytoskeleton of cortical astrocytes, but not of neurons in culture, is a target to Pro and such effects could be mediated, at least in part, by redox imbalance, RhoA and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. The vulnerability of astrocyte cytoskeleton may have important implications for understanding the effects of Pro in the neurotoxicity linked to inborn errors of Pro metabolism.

Abstract: In higher vertebrates, smooth muscle (SM) contains two tissue-specific actin isoforms: α-SMA and γ-SMA, which predominate in vascular and visceral SM, respectively. Whether α-SMA has been extensively studied and recognized for its contractile activity in SM and SM-like cells such as myofibroblasts, myoepithelial and myoid cells, the distribution and role of γ-SMA remained largely unknown. We developed a new specific monoclonal antibody against γ-SMA and confirmed that γ-SMA predominates in the visceral system and is minor in the vascular system, although more expressed in highly compliant veins than in stiff arteries. Contrary to α-SMA, γ-SMA is absent from myofibroblasts in vitro, and in fibrotic diseases in vivo. We raised the hypothesis that, whereas α-SMA is responsible for the “contractile” activity, γ-SMA would be involved in the “compliance” of SM and SM-like cells. Several models support this hypothesis, namely veins vs. arteries and the physiological modifications occurring in the uterus and mammary glands during pregnancy and lactation. Our results suggest that, in addition to enteric smooth muscles, γ-SMA is expressed in all the tissues submitted to an important dilation including veins, gravid uterus, and lactating mammary glands. The hypothesis of two complementary mechanical roles for the two SMA isoforms is sustained by their different intracellular distributions and by functional assays.

Abstract: High activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been documented in several types of cancer and may be associated with survival advantage. In a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line, cisplatin-induced apoptosis was augmented by pretreatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. Apoptosis was accompanied by lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), as shown by immunoblotting of the lysosomal marker protease cathepsin B in extracted cytosol and by immunofluorescence. Moreover, LAMP-2 (lysosomal associated membrane protein-2) was translocated from lysosomal membranes and found in a digitonin extractable fraction together with cytosolic proteins and pretreatment with trichostatin A potentiated the release. Overall, protein level of LAMP-2 was decreased during cell death and, interestingly, inhibition of cysteine cathepsins, by the pan-cysteine cathepsin inhibitor zFA-FMK, prevented loss of LAMP-2. The importance of LAMP-2 for lysosomal membrane stability, was confirmed by showing that LAMP-2 knockout MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were more sensitive to cisplatin as compared to the corresponding wildtype cells. Trichostatin A reduced lysosomal pH from 4.46 to 4.25 and cell death was prevented when lysosomal pH was increased by NH4Cl, or when inhibiting the activity of lysosomal proteases. We conclude that trichostatin A enhances cisplatin induced cell death by decreasing lysosomal pH, which augments cathepsin activity resulting in reduced LAMP-2 level, and might promote LMP.

Abstract: Background
Hyperglycemia promotes podocyte apoptosis and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. However, the mechanisms that mediate hyperglycemia-induced podocyte apoptosis is still far from being fully understood. Recent studies reported that high glucose activate nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in vascular smooth muscle or pancreatic β-cells. Here, we sought to determine if hyperglycemia activates NFAT2 in cultured podocyte and whether this leads to podocyte apoptosis. Meanwhile, we also further explore the mechanisms of NFAT2 activation and NFAT2 mediates high glucose-induced podocyte apoptosis. Methods: Immortalized mouse podocytes were cultured in media containing normal glucose (NG), or high glucose (HG) or HG plus cyclosporine A (a pharmacological inhibitor of calcinerin) or 11R-VIVIT (a special inhibitor of NFAT2). The activation of NFAT2 in podocytes was detected by western blotting and immunofluorescence assay. The role of NFAT2 in hyperglycemia-induced podocyte apoptosis was further evaluated by observing the inhibition of NFAT2 activation by 11R-VIVIT using flow cytometer. Intracellular Ca2+ was monitored in HG-treated podcocytes using Fluo-3/AM. The mRNA and protein expression of apoptosis gene Bax were measured by real time-qPCR and western blotting. Results: HG stimulation activated NFAT2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner in cultured podocytes. Pretreatment with cyclosporine A (500nM) or 11R-VIVIT (100nM) completely blocked NFAT2 nuclear accumulation. Meanwhile, the apoptosis effects induced by HG were also abrogated by concomitant treatment with 11R-VIVIT in cultured podocytes. We further found that HG also increased [Ca2+]i, leading to activation of calcineurin, and subsequent increased nuclear accumulation of NFAT2 and Bax expression in cultured podocytes. Conclusion: Our results identify a new finding that HG-induced podocyte apoptosis is mediated by calcineurin/NFAT2/Bax signaling pathway, which may present a promising target for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Interleukin-10 (IL-10) may have therapeutic potential in various inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, as it can inhibit oxLDL-induced foam cell formation and apoptosis in macrophages. This study investigated the effect of IL-10 on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and apoptosis induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The results demonstrated that IL-10 significantly blocked the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and apoptosis induced by oxLDL. The inhibitory effect of IL-10 on oxLDL-induced apoptosis was partially dependent on reduced p38, but not JNK, phosphorylation. This study also discovered a linkage between IL-10 and p38 MAPK signaling in oxLDL-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Interestingly, this study found that lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) was the only scavenger receptor, on the surface of HUVEC, that was upregulated by oxLDL and the increase in LOX-1 was not suppressed by IL-10. This study confirmed that IL-10 significantly upregulated the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), whereas SOCS3 knockdown by siRNA effectively blocked the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on p38 MAPK-dependent apoptosis induced by oxLDL. These results showed for the first time, that IL-10 modulated oxLDL-induced apoptosis by upregulating SOCS3, which then interrupted p38 MAPK activation in endothelial cells. These findings support the essential role of p38 MAPK in the interplay of oxLDL and IL-10 in endothelial apoptosis.

Abstract: Objectives
The present study investigates the potential role of hypoxia in maintaining stem cell-like properties and therapeutic resistance in K562 leukemic cell.
Methods
Western blot, flow cytometry and cell viability assays were used to investigate the effects of hypoxia (1% O2) on cell proliferation, drug resistance and expression of the hypoxia inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α), the octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), CD133, CD34 and the ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) as well as Smad2 phosphorylation in the drug resistant cell line K562/DOX and its parental cell line.
Results
Hypoxia induced growth inhibition and significantly upregulated HIF-2α, CD133, Oct4, CD34 and ABCG2 expression in the wild type K562 cells (p<0.05). The IC50 of doxorubicin was also enhanced about 2.5-fold in hypoxia. In contrast, the K562/DOX cells, which showed significantly higher ABCG2 expression and IC50 for various drugs, no significant difference in cell proliferation was observed between hypoxia and normoxia. The hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF-2α, CD133, Oct4, CD34 and ABCG2 expression was significantly lower than in the wild type cells (p<0.05). Moreover, hypoxia induced the phosphorylation of Smad2 and additional treatment with SD-208, an inhibitor of the TGF-β receptor I kinase, resulted in a dose-dependent downregulation of CD133 and Oct4 in the K562/DOX cells.
Conclusions
Hypoxia plays an important role in enhancing the stem cell-like properties and to induce multidrug resistance of leukemia cells. The activation of the TGF-β/Smad2 signaling pathway may be involved in the regulation of this pathophysiological process.

Abstract: The zebrafish has become a commonly used model for studying hematopoiesis as a result of its unique attributes. Zebrafish are highly suitable for large-scale genetic and chemical screens compared to other vertebrate systems. It is now possible to analyze hematopoietic lineages in zebrafish and validate cell function via transplantation assays. Here, we review advancements over the past decade in forward genetic screens, chemical screens, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and transplantation assays. Integrating these approaches enables new chemical and genetic screens that assay cell function within the hematopoietic system. Studies in zebrafish will continue to contribute and expand our knowledge about hematopoiesis, and develop novel treatments for clinical applications.

Hemoglobin (Hb) gene disorders are common hereditary disorders in Taiwan, and α- and β-thalassemias are among the well-known Hb disorders here. Our study provides a primary reference for designing a locally relevant antenatal diagnostic test to control the spread of thalassemia.
Methods
Between 1998 and 2011, prenatal diagnoses for identifying thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies were performed on 1240 fetuses at risk for α-hydrops and β-thalassemia major.
Results
Of 1240 specimens analyzed, 1082 (87%) were obtained by amniocentesis; 125 (10%), by chorionic villus sampling; and 33 (3%), by cordocentesis. Prenatal diagnoses revealed that 21.5% of these fetuses as thalassemia major (including α-thalassemia hydrops, β-thalassemia major, and Hb E/β-thalassemia); 50.2%, for thalassemia minor (include α-thalassemia carrier, β-thalassemia carrier, and α-thalassemia combined β-thalassemia carrier); and 28.3% for normal type (include non-α, β-thalassemia). The most common α-hydrops were SEA (Southeast Asian) and Philippine type (frequencies of 74.91 and 5.24%, respectively). The frequency of the IVS-II-654 combined codons 41/42 mutation, the most common β-thalassemia major mutation in this region, was 5.24%. Two fetuses were found with E/β-thalassemia (HbE/IVS-II-654 and HbE/codons 41/42, respectively). Since 1993, Taiwan's Department of Health adopted a national program for screening pregnancies to control spread of thalassemia. In the last 10years, less than 3 such cases have occurred per year. After 2003, this number was 0 for a total of 4years (2003, 2004, 2007, and 2008).
Conclusion
In Taiwan, incidence and frequency of thalassemia genotypes were similar to those previously reported. The national program for screening pregnancies to control spread of thalassemia that resulted in a marked decline in the number of newborns with thalassemia major. Interestingly, prenatal diagnoses revealed 21.5% for thalassemia major, 50.2% for thalassemia minor, 28.3% normal comparison of thalassemia type distribution showed normal type increasing by 13.2% and major type decreasing by 14%. This unique and significant finding needs further clinical studies and discussion to explain such a phenomenon.

Abstract: Background
The impact of obesity on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) outcome remains controversial and has been considered a relative contraindication for the procedure. We investigated the influence of Body Mass Index (BMI) on the clinical course of adults undergoing an ambulatory HSCT after a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen.
Methods
Adults with hematologic diseases undergoing an autologous or allogeneic HSCT after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and supported exclusively with enteral nutrition (EN) were studied. BMI and body fat were sequentially determined. Patients were divided into three BMI subgroups: underweight; normal, and overweight/obese.
Results
Seventy-seven patients with a median follow-up of 21months were evaluated. Fourteen (18.2%) were underweight, 21 (27.3%) had a normal weight, and 42 (54.5%) were overweight/obese. A significant weight loss was observed among all three weight groups after HSCT (P=0.014). No correlation was found between time to engraftment and BMI (P=0.91), serum albumin (P=0.387), and fasting glucose (P=0.64), nor between BMI and acute (P=0.456) or chronic (P=0.209) graft versus host disease (GVHD). On multivariate analysis a higher overall survival (OS) was documented for obese patients (P=0.037).
Discussion
A BMI >30/kg/m2 was independently associated with a higher survival rate after HSCT. Obese patients should not be excluded as transplant candidates based only on this parameter.

Abstract: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) exhibit reduced efficiency and higher variability in neural differentiation compared to embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In this study, we showed that mouse iPSCs failed to efficiently give rise to neuronal cells using conventional methods previously established for driving mouse ESC differentiation. We reported a novel approach which remarkably increases neural differentiation of mouse iPSCs. This novel approach initiated embryoid body (EB) formation directly from the whole cell clones isolated from the top of feeder cells. Compared to conventional neural induction methods such as single cell suspension or monolayer culture, the cell clone-derived EB method led to a pronounced increase in directed generation of various types of neural cells including neural stem cells, motoneurons and dopaminergic neurons in response to different inducers. Through gene expression microarray analysis, we identified 14 genes that were highly expressed in the cell clone-derived EBs. Among them, we found that Cdh2, also known as N-cadherin, played important roles in controlling the neural differentiation efficiency of mouse iPSCs. Forced expression of Cdh2 in iPSCs substantially enhanced the differentiation efficiency while knocking-down of Cdh2 by shRNA blocked the neural differentiation. Our results revealed a critical role of Cdh2 in the process of efficient neural differentiation of mouse iPS cells.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which reside in the marrow of adult mammals and sustain hematopoiesis for the lifetime of the organism, are specified and generated during embryonic development. We are just beginning to understand how HSC develop from more primitive cells and the complexity of the signaling pathways involved. In this work, we review the role of two crucial pathways, Notch and Wnt, in the specification and development of HSC and their nascent microenvironment, the arterial vessels.

Abstract: Blood cells are continually produced from a pool of progenitors that derive from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In vertebrates, the hematopoietic system develops from two distinct waves or generation of precursors. The first wave occurs in the yolk sac, in mammals or equivalent embryonic structure, and produces nucleated primitive erythrocytes that provide the embryo with the first oxygen transporter and are, therefore, essential for the viability of the embryo. The yolk sac also produces myeloid cells that migrate to the central nervous system and to the skin to form the microglia and skin specific macrophages, the Langerhans cells. The second wave occurs in the dorsal aorta and produces multipotential hematopoietic progenitors. These cells are generated once in the lifetime from mesoderm derivatives closely related to endothelial cells, during a short period of embryonic development. Newly generated cells do not reconstitute the hematopoietic compartment of conventional recipients; therefore, they are designated as immature or pre-HSCs. They undergo maturation into adult HSCs in the aorta or in the fetal liver accompanied by the expression of MHC class I, CD45, CD150, Sca-1 and the absence of CD48. Differentiation of HSCs first occurs in the fetal liver, giving rise to mature blood cells. HSCs also expand in the fetal liver, and in a short time period (four days in the mouse embryo), they increase over 40-fold. HSCs and progenitor cells exit the fetal liver and colonize the spleen, where differentiation to the myeloid lineage and particular lymphoid subsets is favored.

Abstract: Molecular understanding of actin dynamics requires a genetically traceable model system that allows live cell imaging together with high-resolution microscopy techniques. Here, we used Drosophila pupal macrophages that combine many advantages of cultured cells with a genetic in vivo model system. Using structured illumination microscopy together with advanced spinning disk confocal microscopy we show that these cells provide a powerful system for single gene analysis. It allows forward genetic screens to characterize the regulatory network controlling cell shape and directed cell migration in a physiological context. We knocked down components regulating lamellipodia formation, including WAVE, single subunits of Arp2/3 complex and CPA, one of the two capping protein subunits and demonstrate the advantages of this model system by imaging mutant macrophages ex vivo as well as in vivo upon laser-induced wounding.

Abstract: Objective.
Fecal incontinence reduces the quality of life of many women but has no long-term cure. Research on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies has shown promising results. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate functional recovery after treatment with MSCs in two animal models of anal sphincter injury.
Methods.
Seventy virgin female rats received a sphincterotomy (SP) to model episiotomy, a pudendal nerve crush (PNC) to model the nerve injuries of childbirth, a sham SP, or a sham PNC. Anal sphincter pressures and electromyography (EMG) were recorded after injury but before treatment and 10days after injury. Twenty-four hours after injury, each animal received either 0.2ml saline or 2million MSCs labelled with green fluorescing protein (GFP) suspended in 0.2ml saline, either intravenously (IV) into the tail vein or intramuscularly (IM) into the anal sphincter.
Results.
MSCs delivered IV after SP resulted in a significant increase in resting anal sphincter pressure and peak pressure, as well as anal sphincter EMG amplitude and frequency 10days after injury. MSCs delivered IM after SP resulted in a significant increase in resting anal sphincter pressure and anal sphincter EMG frequency but not amplitude. There was no improvement in anal sphincter pressure or EMG with in animals receiving MSCs after PNC. GFP-labelled cells were not found near the external anal sphincter in MSC-treated animals after SP.
Conclusion.
MSC treatment resulted in significant improvement in anal pressures after SP but not after PNC, suggesting that MSCs could be utilized to facilitate recovery after anal sphincter injury.

Abstract: Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) drive the nucleation and elongation of linear actin filaments downstream of Rho GTPase signalling pathways. Dictyostelium formin C (ForC) resembles a DRF, except that it lacks a genuine formin homology domain 1 (FH1), raising the questions whether or not ForC can nucleate and elongate actin filaments. We found that a recombinant ForC-FH2 fragment does not nucleate actin polymerization, but moderately decreases the rate of spontaneous actin assembly and disassembly, although the barbed-end elongation rate in the presence of the formin was not markedly changed. However, the protein bound to and crosslinked actin filaments into loose bundles of mixed polarity. Furthermore, ForC is an important regulator of morphogenesis since ForC-null cells are severely impaired in development resulting in the formation of aberrant fruiting bodies. Immunoblotting revealed that ForC is absent during growth, but becomes detectable at the onset of early aggregation when cells chemotactically stream together to form a multicellular organism, and peaks around the culmination stage. Fluorescence microscopy of cells ectopically expressing a GFP-tagged, N-terminal ForC fragment showed its prominent accumulation in the leading edge, suggesting that ForC may play a role in cell migration. In agreement with its expression profile, no defects were observed in random migration of vegetative mutant cells. Notably, chemotaxis of starved cells towards a source of cAMP was severely impaired as opposed to control. This was, however, largely due to a marked developmental delay of the mutant, as evidenced by the expression profile of the early developmental marker csA. In line with this, chemotaxis was almost restored to wild type levels after prolonged starvation. Finally, we observed a complete failure of phototaxis due to abolished slug formation and a massive reduction of spores consistent with forC promoter-driven expression of β-galactosidase in prespore cells. Together, these findings demonstrate ForC to be critically involved in signalling of the cytoskeleton during various stages of development.

Abstract: Podosomes are adhesion structures characteristic of the myeloid cell lineage, encompassing osteoclasts, dendritic cells and macrophages. Podosomes are actin-based structures that are dynamic and capable of self-organization. In particular in the osteoclast, podosomes densely pack into a thick ring called the sealing zone. This adhesion structure is typical of osteoclasts and necessary for the resorption of the bone matrix. We thought to explore in more details the role of podosomes during osteoclast differentiation and migration. To this end, we made from soft to stiff substrates that had not been functionalized with extracellular matrix proteins. Such substrates did not support podosome formation in osteoclasts. With such devices, we could show that integrin activation was sufficient to drive podosome assembly, in a substrate stiffness independent fashion. We additionally report here that osteoclast differentiation is a podosome-independent process. Finally, we show that osteoclasts devoid of podosomes can migrate efficiently. Our study further illustrates the great capacity of myeloid cells to adapt to the different environments they encounter during their life cycle.

Abstract: Advanced stages of tumour and development of metastases are the two major problems in treating liver tumours such as hepatoblastoma (HB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in paediatric patients. Modulation of apoptosis in HB cells enhances the sensitivity of these cells towards various drugs and has been discussed to enforce treatment. We analysed the effect of apoptosis modulators, BH3 mimetics, on mechanisms of dissemination such as adhesion or migration of HB and HCC cells. BH3 mimetics such as ABT-737 and obatoclax can reduce cell migration in a scratch assay as well as adhesion of HB and HCC cells to matrigel. Immunofluorescence staining of F-actin demonstrated that development of lamellipodia, which are important for migration, decreased. BH3 mimetics increase the level of activated caspases 3 and 7 in HUH6 cells. This results in the degradation of GTPase Cdc42, which can be determined by western blot analysis. A pan-caspase inhibitor can block the migration and degradation of Rho-GTPase. In summary, our study showed that BH3 mimetics not only enhance drug sensitivity but also may prevent metastasis by inhibiting HB and HCC cell motility.

Abstract: Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessively inherited storage disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid β-glucosidase. The disease manifestations seen in Gaucher patients are highly heterogeneous as is the responsiveness to therapy. The elucidation of the precise factors responsible for this heterogeneity has been challenging as the development of clinically relevant animal models of Gaucher disease has been problematic. Although numerous murine models for Gaucher disease have been described each has limitations in their specific utility. We describe here, transgenic murine models of Gaucher disease that will be particularly useful for the study of pharmacological chaperones. We have produced stable transgenic mouse strains that individually express wild type, N370S and L444P containing human acid β-glucosidase and show that each of these transgenic lines rescues the lethal phenotype characteristic of acid β-glucosidase null mice. Both the N370S and L444P transgenic models show early and progressive elevations of tissue sphingolipids with L444P mice developing progressive splenic Gaucher cell infiltration. We demonstrate the potential utility of these new transgenic models for the study of Gaucher disease pathogenesis. In addition, since these mice produce only human enzyme, they are particularly relevant for the study of pharmacological chaperones that are specifically targeted to human acid β-glucosidase and the common mutations underlying Gaucher disease.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are essential for the maintenance of the hematopoietic system. However, these cells cannot be maintained or created in vitro, and very little is known about their generation during embryogenesis. Many transcription factors and signaling pathways play essential roles at various stages of HSC development. Members of the ETS (‘E twenty-six’) family of transcription factors are recognized as key regulators within the gene regulatory networks governing hematopoiesis, including the ontogeny of HSCs. Remarkably, although all ETS transcription factors bind the same DNA consensus sequence and overlapping tissue expression is observed, individual ETS transcription factors play unique roles in the development of HSCs. Also, these transcription factors are recurrently used throughout development and their functions are context-dependent, increasing the challenge of studying their mechanism of action. Critically, ETS factors also play roles under pathological conditions, such as leukemia and, therefore, deciphering their mechanism of action will not only enhance our knowledge of normal hematopoiesis, but also inform protocols for their creation in vitro from pluripotent stem cells and the design of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of malignant blood cell diseases. In this review, we summarize the key findings on the roles of ETS transcription factors in HSC development and discuss novel mechanisms by which they could control hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Prominin-1 (CD133) is the first identified gene of a novel class of pentaspan membrane glycoproteins. It is expressed by various epithelial and non-epithelial cells, and notably by stem and cancer stem cells. In non-cancerous cells such as neuro-epithelial and hematopoietic stem cells, prominin-1 is selectively concentrated in plasma membrane protrusions, and released into the extracellular milieu in association with small vesicles. Previously, we demonstrated that prominin-1 contributes to melanoma cells pro-metastatic properties and suggested that it may constitute a molecular target to prevent prominin-1-expressing melanomas from colonizing and growing in lymph nodes and distant organs. Here, we report that three distinct pools of prominin-1 co-exist in cultures of human FEMX-I metastatic melanoma. Morphologically, in addition to the plasma membrane localization, prominin-1 is found within the intracellular compartments, (e.g., Golgi apparatus) and in association with extracellular membrane vesicles. The latter prominin-1–positive structures appeared in three sizes (small, ≤40nm; intermediates ∼40–80nm, and large, >80nm). Functionally, the down-regulation of prominin-1 in FEMX-I cells resulted in a significant reduction of number of lipid droplets as observed by coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering image analysis and Oil red O staining, and surprisingly in a decrease in the nuclear localization of beta-catenin, a surrogate marker of Wnt activation. Moreover, the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) promoter activity was 2 to 4 times higher in parental than in prominin-1-knockdown cells. Collectively, our results point to Wnt signaling and/or release of prominin-1–containing membrane vesicles as mediators of the pro-metastatic activity of prominin-1 in FEMX-I melanoma.

Abstract: Exosomes are secreted by many cell types and display multiple biological functions. The ability to both rapidly detect and quantify exosomes in biological samples would assist in the screening of agents that interfere with their release, and which may therefore be of clinical relevance. Nanoparticle tracking analysis, which detects the size and concentration of exosomes, was used to monitor the inhibition of exosome secretion from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells expressing inhibitory RNA targeted for Rab27a, a known component of the exosome pathway. Inhibition of both Rab27a and Rab27b was observed, resulting in alterations to intracellular CD63+ compartments and the release of fewer exosomes into the culture medium, as determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis and confirmed by immunoblotting and protein quantification. These data show that nanoparticle tracking analysis can be used effectively and rapidly to monitor the disruption of exosome secretion.

Abstract: Erythropoiesis is the process by which progenitors for red blood cells are produced and terminally differentiate. In all vertebrates, two morphologically distinct erythroid lineages (primitive, embryonic, and definitive, fetal/adult) form successively within the yolk sac, fetal liver, and marrow and are essential for normal development. Red blood cells have evolved highly specialized functions in oxygen transport, defense against oxidation, and vascular remodeling. Here we review key features of the ontogeny of red blood cell development in mammals, highlight similarities and differences revealed by genetic and gene expression profiling studies, and discuss methods for identifying erythroid cells at different stages of development and differentiation.

Abstract: TIRAP and Myd88 are adaptor proteins for Toll-like receptors-2 and -4 (TLR2/4) which are engaged in transducing the signal to downstream molecules. Several studies have shown the increased role of infection factors in pathogenesis of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). This prompted us to test whether there is a correlation between MyD88–TIRAP dynamics before and after inflammatory stimuli. We determined the mRNA and protein expression of TIRAP and MyD88 in CD5+CD19+ B-CLL cells and in a subpopulation of normal B CD19+ lymphocytes. Additionally we determined the influence of lipopolysaccharide Escherichia coli — TLR4-ligand (LPS) and Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I — TLR2-ligand (SAC) on TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein, also called MyD88 adaptor-like (TIRAP) and myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) expression. We have found that the mRNA and protein expression of TIRAP and MyD88 in B-CLL lymphocytes is lower compared with that in normal B lymphocytes. LPS and SAC stimulation in normal lymphocytes significantly altered neither TIRAP nor MyD88 mRNA expression, whereas TIRAP protein level substantially decreased after TLR agonist treatment. We did not observe any changes in MyD88 protein level after B lymphocyte stimulation. There was a significant increase in TIRAP mRNA expression after LPS and SAC stimulation of B-CLL cells. MyD88 mRNA expression levels in B-CLL lymphocytes slightly decreased upon treatment with either stimulator. Stimulation with TLR agonists did not cause changes in TIRAP and MyD88 expression at the protein level in B-CLL lymphocytes. The results of our study suggest that there may exist a, yet unknown, defect of TIRAP and MyD88 proteins in B-CLL lymphocytes.

It has been described recently by our group that TIP47 plays an essential role for the targeting of the NS5A-complexed RNA genome from the replicon complex to the lipid droplet. Moreover, apolipoprotein (apo) E was found to be associated with the viral particle. In light of the fact, that TIP47 harbors an apoE like domain and has a high affinity to lipoproteins, the interaction of TIP47 with the viral particle and the potential relevance for the release of the viral particle were investigated. Coimmunoprecipitations and electron microscopy analysis using immunogold labeling revealed that TIP47 binds to the viral particle and stays associated with the released HCV particle. Silencing of the TIP47 binding partner Rab9 by lentiviral transduction abolishes the viral replication. However, destruction of TIP47-Rab9 interactions by deletion/mutation of the Rab9 binding does not abolish the genome replication domain but prevents the release of HCV particles. The binding of these TIP47 mutants to the viral particle is not affected by destruction of the Rab9 binding domain. Moreover, we found that these TIP47 mutants lacking the binding site for Rab9 misdirect the de novo synthesized viral particles to the autophagosomal/lysosomal compartment where the particles are degraded. From this we conclude that the Rab9-complexed TIP47 plays an essential role for the proper release of hepatitis C viral particles.

Abstract: Over a decade ago, several preclinical transplantation studies suggested the striking concept of the tissue-reconstituting ability (often referred to as HSC plasticity) of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). While this heralded an exciting time of radically new therapies for disorders of many organs and tissues, the concept was soon mired in controversy and remained dormant for almost a decade. This commentary provides a concise review of evidence for HSC plasticity, including more recent findings based on single HSC transplantation in mouse and clinical transplantation studies. There is strong evidence for the concept that HSCs are pluripotent and are the source for the majority, if not all, of the cell types in our body. Also discussed are some biological and experimental issues that need to be considered in the future investigation of HSC plasticity.

Abstract: Cell research often requires combinational detection of RNA and DNA by fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA–DNA FISH). However, it is difficult to preserve the fragile RNA signals through the harsh conditions used to denature the DNA template in DNA FISH. The current protocols of RNA–DNA FISH still cannot work robustly in all experiments. RNA–DNA FISH remains as a technically challenging and tedious experiment. By incorporating protein components into the signal detection steps of RNA FISH, which is then followed by a post-fixation step, we established an improved protocol of RNA–DNA FISH. The established method worked satisfyingly and robustly in our studies on Xist (inactivated X chromosome specific transcript) RNA and Terra (telomeric repeat-containing RNA). Our results provided the direct evidence to show that, not all the telomeres are associated with Terra, and a significant fraction of Terra foci do not overlap with telomere DNA in interphase cell nuclei. The improved method of simultaneous RNA–DNA FISH is reliable and time-efficient. It can be used in a variety of biological studies.

Abstract: Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) results from partial deficiency of ferrochelatase (FECH). Genetically, EPP patients differ from asymptomatic mutation carriers at the unmutated FECH allele, the expression of which is modulated by single nucleotide polymorphism IVS3-48C/T. The IVS3-48C genotype, which is present among patients, leads to correct splicing of 60% of the pre-mRNA and to alternative splicing of 40%, the latter mRNA-product being destroyed by nonsense-mediated decay. An IVS3-48T genotype generates 80% correct and 20% aberrant products. Our study demonstrated that under iron deficient conditions, the aberrant splice product was increased to 56% and 50% of total FECH mRNA in erythroleukemic K562 and lymphoblastoid cell lines, respectively, both being homozygous for IVS3-48T. Concomitantly, FECH protein was decreased. Iron deficiency had less effect on the FECH splice ratio in an IVS3-48C/C lymphoblastoid cell line. Effects similar to iron deficiency were generated by siRNA knockdown of either splicing factor U2AF65 or Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase Jumonji domain-containing protein 6 (Jmjd6), which interacts with U2AF65 by lysyl-hydroxylation. Based on these results, we propose that the availability of iron, a co-factor of Jmjd6, modulates U2AF65-lysyl-hydroxylation. This in turn, influences the relative amounts of correct and aberrant FECH mRNA splice products and thus, regulates the FECH enzyme activity.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can self-renew and become all three germ layers. Nodal/Activin signaling specifies developmental status in hESCs: moderate Nodal/Activin signaling maintains pluripotency, while enhancement and inhibition promote definitive endoderm (DE) and neuroectoderm (NE) development, respectively. However, how modulation of Nodal/Activin signaling influences developmental competence and commitment toward specific lineages is still unclear. Here, we showed that enhancement of Nodal/Activin signaling for 4days was necessary and sufficient to upregulate DE markers, while it diminished the upregulation of NE markers by inhibition of Nodal/Activin signaling. This suggests that after 4days of enhanced Nodal/Activin signaling, hESCs are committed to the DE lineage and have lost competence toward the NE lineage. In contrast, inhibition of Nodal/Activin signaling using LY364947 for 2days was sufficient to impair competence toward the DE lineage, although cells were still able to activate LEFTY1 and NODAL, direct targets of Nodal/Activin signaling. Expression analyses indicated that the levels of pluripotency regulators NANOG and POU5F1 were significantly diminished by 2days of LY364947 treatment, although the expression of NANOG, but not POU5F1, was restored immediately upon Activin A treatment. Thus, downregulation of POU5F1 coincided with the abrogation of DE competence caused by inhibition of Nodal/Activin signaling.

Abstract: Macrophages are the prominent components of solid tumors and have complex dual functions in their interaction with cancer cells. Strong evidence suggests that TAM is a part of inflammatory circuits that promote tumor progression. B7-homologue 3 (B7-H3), a recently identified homologue of B7.1/2 (CD80/86), has been described to exert co-stimulatory and immune regulatory functions. Here, we showed that a fraction of macrophages in tumor stroma expressed surface B7-H3 molecule. Normal macrophages, which did not express B7-H3, would be induced expressing B7-H3 molecule when culturing with tumor cell. Although a lung cancer cell line constitutively expressed B7-H3 mRNA and protein in plasma, primary tumor cell isolated from the transplanted lung carcinoma model expressed B7-H3 on the surface. Interestingly, in transplanted lung carcinoma model, the expression of membrane-bound B7-H3 in tumor cells was increased as prolonging of tumor transformation. In support, IL-10 released from TAM could stimulate cancer cell expression of membrane bound B7-H3. Furthermore, Lung cancer and TAM-related B7-H3 was identified as a strong inhibitor of T-cell effect and influenced the outcome of T cell immune response. In conclusion, TAM–tumor cell interaction-induced membrane-bound B7-H3 represents a novel immune escape mechanism which links the pro-inflammatory response to immune tolerance in the tumor milieu.

Abstract: Malaria is one of the most common diseases in the African population. Genetic variance in glucose dehydrogenase 6-phosphate (G6PD) in humans determines the response to malaria exposure. In this study, we aimed to analyze the frequency of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (G202A and A376G) present in two local tribes of Sudanese Arabs from the region of the 4th Nile cataract in Sudan, the Shagia and Manasir. The polymorphisms in G6PD were analyzed in 217 individuals (126 representatives of the Shagia tribe and 91 of the Manasir tribe). Real-time PCR and RFLP-PCR were utilized to analyze significant differences in the prevalence of alleles and genotypes. The 202A G6P allele frequency was 0.7%, whereas the G202 variant was found in 93.3% of cases. The AA, GA, and GG genotype frequencies for the A376G G6PD codon among the Shagia were 88, 11.1, and 0.9%, respectively; this is similar to the distribution among Manasir tribe representatives (94.5, 3.3, and 2.2%, respectively; OR 3.44 [0.85–16.17], p=0.6). Notably, in north-eastern Sudan the G6PD B (202G/376A) compound genotype frequency was 90.3%, whereas the G6PD A variant (202G/376G) was found in 1.4% of that population. Identification of the G6PD A− variant (202A/376G) in the isolated Shagia tribe provides important information regarding the tribal ancestry. Taken together, the data presented in this study suggest that the Shagia tribe was still nomadic between 4000 and 12,000years ago. Moreover, the lack of G6PD A− genotype among ethnically diverse Monasir tribesmen indicates a separation of the Shagia from the other tribes in the region of the 4th Nile cataract in Sudan.

Abstract: Three-dimensional aggregation cultures allow for complex development of differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells. However, this approach is not easily amenable to live-cell imaging and electrophysiological applications due to the thickness and the geometry of the tissue. Here, we present an improvement on the traditional aggregation method by combining the use of cell culture inserts with serum-free embryoid bodies (SFEBs). The use of this technique allows the structures to maintain their three-dimensional structure while thinning substantially. We demonstrate that this technique can be used for electrophysiological recodings as well as live-cell calcium imaging combined with electrical stimulation, akin to organotypic slice preparations. This provides an important experimental tool that can be used to bridge 3-D structures with traditional monolayer approaches used in stem cell applications.

Abstract: Summary
Microtubule transport of herpesvirus capsids from the cell periphery to the nucleus is imperative for viral replication and, in the case of many alphaherpesviruses, transmission into the nervous system. Using the neuroinvasive herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus (PRV), we show that the viral protein 1/2 (VP1/2) tegument protein associates with the dynein/dynactin microtubule motor complex and promotes retrograde microtubule transport of PRV capsids. Functional activation of VP1/2 requires binding to the capsid protein pUL25 or removal of the capsid-binding domain. A proline-rich sequence within VP1/2 is required for the efficient interaction with the dynein/dynactin microtubule motor complex as well as for PRV virulence and retrograde axon transport in vivo. Additionally, in the absence of infection, functionally active VP1/2 is sufficient to move large surrogate cargoes via the dynein/dynactin microtubule motor complex. Thus, VP1/2 tethers PRV capsids to dynein/dynactin to enhance microtubule transport, neuroinvasion, and pathogenesis.

Abstract: Alpha thalassemia (α-thal) is one of the most common genetic disorders in the world. It is characterized by the absence or reduced expression of α-globin genes. The frequency of α-thal mutations in the province of Hatay in South Turkey is unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the spectrum of α-thal mutations in this province. Three hundred and nine patients were tested for α-thal mutations by using reverse dot blot hybridization technique and nine different mutations were detected in 97 of them. Among the 9 different mutations found, the most frequent mutations were the -α3.7 (43.81%), -α2−5nt (6.70%), - -MED (5.67%) and α2Poly A2 (2.57%). In the present study, - -FIL mutation was detected in a patient for the first time in Turkey. Our results indicated that α-thal mutations are highly heterogeneous and -α3.7 is the most prevalent mutation in Hatay province of South Turkey. In addition, - -FIL mutation was detected in a patient for the first time in Turkey. This new finding may contribute to the establishment of a national mutation database and genetic counseling.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models have an invaluable role in understanding the behaviour of tumour cells in a well defined microenvironment. This is because some aspects of tumour characteristics cannot be fully recapitulated in a cell monolayer (2D). In the present study, we compared growth patterns, expression of signalling molecules, and metabolism-associated proteins of endometrial cancer cell lines in 3D and 2D cell cultures. Cancer cells formed spherical structures in 3D reconstituted basement membrane (3D rBM), and the morphological appearance was cell line dependent. Cell differentiation was observed after 8 days in the 3D rBM. There was reduced proliferation, detected by less expression of PCNA in 3D rBM than in 2D cell monolayers. The addition of exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) to cancer cells induced phosphorylation of EGFR and Akt in both cell culture conditions. The uptake of glucose was selectively altered in the 3D rBM, but there was a lack of association with Glut-1 expression. The secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was selectively altered in 3D rBM, and it was cell line dependent. Our data demonstrated that 3D rBM as an in vitro model can influence proliferation and metabolism of endometrial cancer cell behaviour compared to 2D cell monolayer. Changes are specific to individual cell types. The use of 3D rBM is, therefore, important in the in vitro study of targeted anticancer therapies.

Abstract: KLF1 is an erythroid specific transcription factor that is involved in erythroid lineage commitment, globin switching and terminal red blood cell maturation. Various mutations of KLF1 have been identified in humans, which have led to both benign and pathological phenotypes. The E325K mutation, within the second zinc finger of the KLF1 gene, has been shown to cause a new form of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) now labeled as CDA type IV. We report the fourth documented case of this mutation, and propose a clinical diagnostic model to better identify this disease in other patients. Our patient is a Taiwanese child who presented to us at 8years of age with severe hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF), iron overload, and dyserythropoiesis in the bone marrow. KLF1 sequence analysis revealed a G-to-A transition in one allele of exon 3, which resulted in the substitution of a glutamate 325 by a lysine. Flow cytometry analysis revealed decreased protein expression of CD44 on the red blood cells, and decreased red blood cell deformability as measured using an ektacytometer. Blood typing revealed his red blood cells to be Co(a-b-), In(b-), LW(ab-) and Lu(b+), even though DNA testing predicted that he would be Co(a+b-) and LW(a+b-). This newly discovered CDA combines features of a hemoglobinopathy, RBC membrane defect and hereditary persistence of HbF (HPFH) which are not seen in the previous types of CDA. Increased awareness of this phenotype may improve the more prompt and accurate diagnosis of these patients.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is characterized by accumulation of glucosylceramide in lysosomes due to mutations in the GBA1 gene encoding the lysosomal hydrolase β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). The disease has a broad spectrum of phenotypes, which were divided into three different Types; Type 1 GD is not associated with primary neurological disease while Types 2 and 3 are associated with central nervous system disease. GCase molecules are synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound polyribosomes, translocated into the ER and following modifications and correct folding, shuttle to the lysosomes. Mutant GCase molecules, which fail to fold correctly, undergo ER associated degradation (ERAD) in the proteasomes, the degree of which is one of the factors that determine GD severity. Several pharmacological chaperones have already been shown to assist correct folding of mutant GCase molecules in the ER, thus facilitating their trafficking to the lysosomes. Ambroxol, a known expectorant, is one such chaperone. Here we show that ambroxol increases both the lysosomal fraction and the enzymatic activity of several mutant GCase variants in skin fibroblasts derived from Type 1 and Type 2 GD patients.

Abstract: The hereditary deficiency of antioxidant enzymes when associated with sickle cell anemia (SCA) further contributes to the oxidation of hemoglobin S, which increases the formation of degradation products of this hemoglobin. The glutathione S transferases play an important role in the conjugation of glutathione to endogenous products of peroxidation of lipids and protect cells from the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. We analyzed genomic DNA from 278 patients with sickle cell anemia to correlate the genotypes GSTT1 and/or GSTM1 null (determined by multiplex PCR technique) and the clinical manifestations of the disease. 27% of patients showed absence of the GSTM1 gene and 15% had absence of GSTT1. The GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes were found in 11% of the population. The risk of individuals with the GSTT1 null genotype developing acute chest syndrome and aseptic necrosis of the femoral head were, respectively, 10 and 6.3 times higher when compared with those individuals who had of this gene. Patients with GSTM1 null showed a risk 3.9 times higher to develop stroke and high risk for malleolar ulcers and acute chest syndrome (OR=6.9 and 4.2, respectively). The individuals with the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes showed a higher chance of developing acute chest syndrome, malleolar ulcer and aseptic necrosis of the femoral head. The absence of GSTT1 and/or GSTM1 was an important risk factor for increasing the morbidity of SCA, especially in regard to acute chest syndrome.

Abstract: Hematopoiesis represents one of the paradigmatic systems for studying stem cell biology, but our understanding of how the hematopoietic system develops during embryogenesis is still incomplete. While many lessons have been learned from studying the mouse embryo, embryonic stem cells have come to the fore as an alternative and more tractable model to recapitulate hematopoietic development. Here we review what is known about the embryonic origin of blood from these complementary systems and how transcription factor networks regulate the emergence of hematopoietic tissue from the mesoderm. Furthermore, we have performed an integrated analysis of genome-wide microarray and ChIP-seq data sets from mouse embryos and embryonic stem (ES) cell lines deficient in key regulators and demonstrate how this type of analysis can be used to reconstruct regulatory hierarchies that both confirm existing regulatory linkages and suggest additional interactions.

Abstract: Adipose tissue is an important energy reservoir, and its over-development results in obesity in humans or body fat over-deposition in livestock. Loss of preadipocytes through apoptosis has been proposed as an alternative way to reduce adipose tissue mass. At present, the effect and regulatory mechanism of Sirt1 and camptothecin on porcine preadipocyte apoptosis are still largely unknown. Here, we evaluated whether Sirt1 had any role in the basal cellular and camptothecin-induced conditions in porcine preadipocytes. Flow cytometric analysis shows that viable cells decrease as well as early apoptotic and late apoptotic cells increase after knockdown of Sirt1 in porcine preadipocytes. Camptothecin induces porcine preadipocyte apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, assessed with the Hoechst staining and western blot analysis. Interestingly, silencing of Sirt1 significantly enhances sensitivity of porcine preadipocytes to camptothecin, which may be due to upregulation of p53, acetylated p53, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2. On the contrary, under the Sirt1 overexpression condition viable cells’ number significantly increases when challenging with camptothecin, and the protein levels of cleaved caspase-3, p53, acetylated p53 and Bax are downregulated. We also find that hyperacetylated p53 is the major effect of Sirt1 knockdown by overexpression of a mutated p53, whereas Sirt1 overexpression prevents camptothecin-induced apoptosis through p53 deacetylation in preadipocytes. Furthermore, repressing preadipocyte apoptosis of Sirt1 is mediated by direct interaction with cleaved caspase-3 using immunoprecipitation and inhibition of caspase-3 transcriptional activity using luciferase reporter assays.

Abstract: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are among the target cells of cancer therapy because they are uniquely involved in both cancer progression and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. We identified side population (SP) cells, which are known to be an enriched population of CSC, in five oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells (SCC9, SCC25, TOSCC7, TOSCC17, and TOSCC23). The percentages of SP cells ranged from 0% to 3.3%, with TOSCC23 cells showing the highest percentages of SP cells (3.3% of the total cell population). The SP cells isolated from TOSCC23 cells also showed greater cell proliferation and invasion compared to non-SP (MP) cells. Therefore, our initial findings suggested that SP cells were enriched for CSC-like cells. Furthermore, DNA microarray analysis revealed that the expression of cell proliferation-related and anti-apoptotic genes was greater in SP cells compared to MP cells. We focused on Lin28a, which showed the highest expression (approximately 22-fold) among the upregulated genes. The overexpression of Lin28a in TOSCC23 cells increased their proliferation, colony formation, and invasion. These findings suggest that Lin28a is an appropriate CSC target molecule for OSCC treatment

Abstract: Peripheral neuroblastic tumors exist as a heterogeneous mixture of neuroblastic (N-type) cells and Schwannian stromal (S-type) cells. These stromal cells not only represent a differentiated and less aggressive fraction of the tumor, but also have properties that can influence the further differentiation of nearby malignant cells. In vitro neuroblastoma cultures exhibit similar heterogeneity with N-type and S-type cells representing the neuroblastic and stromal portions of the tumor, respectively, in behavior, morphology, and molecular expression patterns. In this study, we deplete kinase D-interacting substrate of 220kD (Kidins220) with an shRNA construct and thereby cause morphologic transition of the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line from N-type to S-type. The resulting cells have similar morphology and expression profile to SH-EP1 cells, a native S-type cell line from the same parent cell line, and to SH-SY5Y cells treated with BrdU, a treatment that induces S-type morphology. Specifically, both Kidins220-deficient SH-SY5Y cells and native SH-EP1 cells demonstrate down-regulation of the genes DCX and STMN2, markers for the neuronal lineage. We further show that Kidins220, DCX and STMN2 are co-down-regulated in cells of S-type morphology generated by methods other than Kidins220 depletion. Finally, we report that the association of low Kidins220 expression with S-type morphology and low DCX and STMN2 expression is demonstrated in spontaneously occurring human peripheral neuroblastic tumors. We propose that Kidins220 is critical in N- to S-type transition of neural crest tumor cells.

Abstract: Iron chelators and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques for assessing iron loading in liver and heart have greatly improved survival of thalassemic patients suffering iron overload-associated cardiomyopathy. However, the correlation between liver iron concentration and myocardial siderosis is ambiguous. Using an objective metric of time delay, scientists have demonstrated a lag in the loading and unloading of cardiac iron with respect to that of the liver. In the present study, we further tested this hypothesis with different chelation treatments. We analyzed the effect of three chelating treatment approaches on liver and cardiac iron content in 24 highly compliant patients who underwent 3 or more MRIs under each chelation treatment. Of the 84 MRIs considered, 32 were performed on deferoxamine (DFO — 8 patients), 24 on deferiprone (DFP — 7 patients), and 28 on combined therapy (DFO+DFP — 9 patients). In patients treated with DFO, changes in cardiac iron significantly lagged changes in liver iron but the opposite pattern was observed in patients treated with DFP (p=0.005), while combined therapy showed a pattern in-between DFO and DFP. We conclude that the temporality of changes of cardiac and liver iron is chelator-dependent, so that chelation therapy can be tailored to balance iron elimination from the liver and the heart.

Abstract: Neurite outgrowth is mediated by dynamic changes of the cytoskeleton and is largely controlled by Rho GTPases and their regulators. Here, we show that the polarity protein Scribble controls PC12 cell neurite outgrowth in response to nerve growth factor. Scribble knockdown decreases neurite numbers and increases neurite length. This effect is linked to TrkA the cognate receptor for NGF as pharmacological inhibition of phosphorylated TrkA (pTrkA) reduces Scribble expression. Moreover, Scribble forms a complex with the MAPK components ERK1/2 in a growth factor dependent manner. In RNAi experiments where Scribble expression is efficiently depleted sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation is reduced. Conversely, siRNA with intermediate Scribble silencing efficiency fails to match this effect indicating that ERK1/2 activation depends on basic Scribble protein levels. Finally, Scribble translocates to the plasma membrane in response to growth factor where it complexes with HRas and Rac1 suggesting that the phenotype activated by loss of Scribble may be a result of altered GTPase activity. Together, these results demonstrate a novel role for Scribble in neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells.

miR-150 regulates high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by targeting the transcriptional co-activator p300,

Abstract: p300, a transcriptional co-activator with histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activity, plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in response to multiple pro-hypertrophic stimuli including hyperglycemia. However, the precise mechanisms by which p300 expression is regulated remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of miR-150, a potential p300-targeting microRNA (miRNA), in the post-transcriptional control of p300 expression and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by high glucose. We observed that the expression of miR-150 was significantly reduced, whereas the expression of p300 was strongly elevated, concomitant with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, in the hearts of diabetic rats compared with normal controls. Similar alterations were observed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes that had been exposed to high levels of glucose. miR-150 mimics inhibited p300 3′-UTR luciferase reporter activity, as well as endogenous p300 expression. In addition, miR-150 mimics prevented glucose-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Co-transfection with a p300 expression vector and miR-150 mimics reversed the protective effect of miR-150 on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We further showed that the high glucose-mediated activation of PKCβ2 in turn mediated the down-regulation of miR-150 expression. These data demonstrated a novel upstream role for miR-150 in p300-mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and revealed a previously uncharacterized miRNAs and HATs cross-talk mechanism for the hypertrophic phenotype induced by high glucose.

Abstract: Cardiac damage remains a major cause of mortality among patients with thalassemia major. The detection of a lower cardiac magnetic resonance T2* (CMR-T2*) signal has been suggested as a powerful predictor of the subsequent development of heart failure. However, the lack of worldwide availability of CMR-T2* facilities prevents its widespread use for follow-up evaluations of cardiac function in thalassemia major patients, warranting the need to assess the utility of other possible procedures. In this setting, the determination of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) offers an accurate and reproducible method for heart function evaluation. These findings suggest a reduction in LVEF≥7%, over time, determined by 2-D echocardiography, may be considered a strong predictive tool for the detection of thalassemia major patients with increased risk of cardiac death. The reduction of LVEF≥7% had higher (84.76%) predictive value. Finally, Kaplan–Meier survival curves of thalassemia major patients with LVEF≥7% showed a statistically significant decreased probability of survival for heart disease (p=0.0022). However, because of limitations related to the study design, such findings should be confirmed in a large long-term prospective clinical trial.

Abstract: We studied the PK-LR gene in 10 unrelated Indian patients with congenital haemolytic anemia associated with erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency. The patients had a variable presentation ranging from a very mild compensated hemolysis to severe anemia. Nine different mutations were detected among the 20 mutated alleles identified: one deletion (c.1042–1044del) p.Lys348del and eight single-nucleotide (nt) substitutions resulting in amino acid exchanges c.397A>G (p.Asn133Asp), c.992A>G (p.Asp331Gly), c.1072G>A (p.Gly358Arg), c.1076G>A (p.Arg359His), c.1219G>A (p.Glu407Lys), c.1241C>T (p.Pro414Leu), c.1436G>A (p.Arg479His) and c.1529G>A (p.Arg510Gln) were identified. Although all the exons, the flanking regions and the promoter region were sequenced in all cases, we failed to detect the second expected mutation in two subjects. Two mutations [c.397A>G; c.1241C>T] were novel. These novel missense mutations involved highly conserved amino acids. Two mutations were identified for the first time in the homozygous state globally (c1042–1044del; c.1072G>A) and two other mutations were identified for the first time in our population (c.1076G>A; c.1529G>A). This study along with our earlier report suggests that the most frequent mutations in India would appear to be c.1436G>A (18.33%), followed by c.992A>G (11.66%) and c.1456C>T (11.66%). Structural implications of amino acid substitutions were correlated with the clinical phenotypes seen.

Abstract: MUC16/CA125 is over-expressed in human epithelial tumors including ovarian, breast and some other carcinomas. The purpose of this study is to investigate how cell surface MUC16 is functionally involved in tumor progression, with a special focus on the role of its cytoplasmic tail. Forced expression of C-terminal MUC16 fragment (MUC16C) in epithelial cancer cells increased cell migration. We found that MUC16C directly interacted with Src family kinases (SFKs). Notably, localizations of E-cadherin and β-catenin at the cell–cell contacts were more diffuse in MUC16C transfectants compared with mock transfectants. Furthermore, MUC16C transfectants showed reduced Ca2+-dependent cell–cell adhesion, but the treatment of cells with PP2, a SFKs inhibitor, restored this. Because cell surface MUC16 is also associated with the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex, the over-expression of MUC16 and its interaction with SFKs may enhance SFKs-induced deregulation of E-cadherin. Thus, our results suggest a role for cell surface MUC16 in cell–cell adhesion of epithelial cancer cells.

Abstract: Genetic recombination has been implicated as a mechanism that drives mutagenesis in the human globin gene clusters, either as a result of unequal crossover or gene conversion. In this paper, a novel fusion gene was identified in a Chinese girl with hemoglobin H disease. The proband's father was a compound heterozygote for the common −α4.2 deletion and this fusion gene, and her mother was heterozygous for the common −−SEA deletion (−−SEA/αα). Both her parents had a hypochromic and microcytic red cell phenotype and a normal hemoglobin level. Molecular studies revealed a compound heterozygote for the −−SEA deletion and this novel fusion gene and the patient had the clinical features of classic hemoglobin H disease. Sequence analysis revealed that the mutant gene was the result of a fusion between the α2 and ψα1 genes. The recombination began at exon 3 of α2 gene, crossing with exon 3 of the ψα1 gene. With this recombination, the conservative 3′UTR of the α2 gene was changed, and an extensive transcript with a new signal 1048bp 3′ to the terminating codon was found. The abnormal transcripts of the fusion gene read through the intergenic sequence.

Abstract: This paper reviews the development of therapy for acute myelogenous leukemia that in 1973 led to the regimen of 7days of continuous intravenous arabinosylcytosine (cytarabine) and the first 3 concurrent days of intravenous daunorubicin, given the nickname “7+3.” The state of leukemia treatment in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s is reviewed, the discovery of the two drugs in question described, and the introduction of clinical trials to reach an optimal regimen for their use delineated. During the 1950s, following World War Two and after a period of civil reconstitution, a national effort, facilitated by the U.S. Congress and federal investments in the National Cancer Institute, was initiated to enhance cancer therapy in the United States. The development of mouse models of leukemia and advances in understanding the structure and function of DNA and RNA and the process of cell proliferation provided new targets for drug development and new concepts for their use. The year, 2013, marks the 40th year that this protocol, 7+3, is the method of induction of remission for most patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Its inadequacies also are made clear. Many patients with the disease die soon after diagnosis, and patients who have more unfavorable oncogenetic subtypes, intrinsically drug resistant cells, and greater intolerance to therapy make up the vast majority of the affected and few are cured. It is evident to all that new paradigms are needed if acute myelogenous leukemia is to be subdued in most patients with the disease.

Abstract: Background
Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by an autosomal-recessive deficiency of β-glucocerebrosidase leading to an accumulation of glucosylceramide in monocytes/macrophage lineage. We analyzed immune cells and especially the function of dendritic cells to evaluate the potential impact of glucosylceramide accumulation in these cells and its possible role in infections and malignancies usually described in this pathology. These analyses were performed for each patient without and under enzyme replacement therapy.
Methods
Seven GD patients were studied and compared with healthy volunteers. Immune cells (B cells, T cells, NK, dendritic cells), were analyzed by flow cytometry directly on whole blood. Cytokine production by blood dendritic cells was assessed after stimulation by toll-like receptor ligands. Cytokines in sera were measured using a multiplex assay.
Results
GD patients displayed decreased numbers of NK cells, γδ2 T cells and increased frequency of memory CD4+CD45RO+ T cells, when compared to healthy controls. Numbers of dendritic cells (myeloid (mDC) and plasmacytoid (pDC) dendritic cells) were also decreased. We demonstrated that pDC from GD patients exhibited a decrease in IFNα production after TLR9 stimulation compared to controls. Importantly, enzyme replacement therapy restored pDC function. Finally, we observed an increase of IL-8 and IL-18 in GD patient sera, which were reduced under enzyme replacement therapy.
Conclusions
Our data confirm that patients with GD exhibit altered numbers of innate and T lymphocytes and show for the first time that pDC from GD patients exhibit altered responsiveness to TLR9. These alterations could contribute to a decreased response to pathogens and could favor the development of malignancies.

Abstract: The high frequency of a unique neonatal preleukaemic syndrome, transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM), and subsequent acute myeloid leukaemia in early childhood in patients with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) points to a specific role for trisomy 21 in transforming foetal haematopoietic cells. N-terminal truncating mutations in the key haematopoietic transcription factor GATA1 are acquired during foetal life in virtually every case. These mutations are not leukaemogenic in the absence of trisomy 21. In mouse models, deregulated expression of chromosome 21-encoded genes is implicated in leukaemic transformation, but does not recapitulate the effects of trisomy 21 in a human context. Recent work using primary human foetal liver and bone marrow cells, human embryonic stem cells and iPS cells shows that prior to acquisition of GATA1 mutations, trisomy 21 itself alters human foetal haematopoietic stem cell and progenitor cell biology causing multiple abnormalities in myelopoiesis and B-lymphopoiesis. The molecular basis by which trisomy 21 exerts these effects is likely to be extremely complex, to be tissue-specific and lineage-specific and to be dependent on ontogeny-related characteristics of the foetal microenvironment.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) regulates various biological processes, including differentiation, bone remodeling and angiogenesis, and is particularly important as a regulator of homeostasis and cell growth in normal tissue. Interestingly, some studies have reported that TGF-β1 induces apoptosis through induction of specific genes, whereas others suggest that TGF-β1 inhibits apoptosis and facilitates cell survival. Resolving these discrepancies, which may reflect differences in cellular context, is an important research priority. Here, using the parental mink lung epithelial cell line, Mv1Lu, and its derivatives, R1B and DR26, lacking TGF-β receptors, we investigated the involvement of TGF-β signaling in the effects of γ-irradiation. We found that canonical TGF-β signaling played an important role in protecting cells from γ-irradiation. Introduction of functional TGF-β receptors or constitutively active Smads into R1B and DR26 cell lines reduced DNA fragmentation, Caspase-3 cleavage and γ-H2AX foci formation in γ-irradiated cells. Notably, we also found that de novo protein synthesis was required for the radio-resistant effects of TGF-β1. Our data thus indicate that TGF-β1 protected against γ-irradiation, decreasing DNA damage and reducing apoptosis, and thereby enhanced cell survival.

Abstract: Cisplatin resistance in cancer cells is due to a pleiotropic phenotype transition that allows cells to resist cell death. miRNAs have been shown to be reliable markers of phenotype, critical in cell differentiation, and dysregulated in cancer and other pathologies. Here we investigate the influence of miRNA on cisplatin resistance in KB adenocarcinoma cells. Silencing both DICER and TRBP2 in the miRNA biosynthesis pathway in KB-3-1 (sensitive parental), KB-CP.5 (cisplatin-resistant), and KB-CP20 (highly cisplatin-resistant) cells resulted in the reversal of cisplatin resistance, with no effect on cell viability in the absence of cisplatin. We found miR-181 expression differences in the cell lines using RT-PCR, with several members of the miR-181 family overexpressed in two KB cisplatin-resistant lines and in two cisplatin-resistant lung cancer lines, compared to their respective parental cells. Functional assays showed minimal effects of miR-181 on cisplatin resistance. We conclude that the miRNA biosynthesis pathway is critical for maintaining the cisplatin-resistant phenotype, but that it is difficult to determine the precise miRNAs involved in cisplatin resistance simply using expression profiles of individual miRNA species. Functional assays are needed to determine the influence of a specific miRNA and different members of the same miRNA family may have opposite effects.

Abstract: Abstract
The mammalian Hippo pathway comprises mammalian Ste20-like kinases (MST1/2) and large tumor suppressor kinases (LATS1/2). LATS1/2, which are activated by MST1/2, phosphorylate a transcriptional co-activator, yes-associated protein (YAP), and induce the recruitment of YAP by 14-3-3 to cytoplasm, so that the TEAD-dependent gene transcriptions are turned off. Although the core components of the Hippo pathway are well conserved in metazoans, it has been discussed that Caenorhabditis elegans lacks YAP ortholog, we found that F13E6.4 gene encodes a protein that shows sequence similarities to YAP in the N-terminal TEAD-binding domain and in the WW domain. We designated this gene as yap-1. YAP-1 is widely expressed in various cells such as epithelial cells, muscles, hypodermal cells, gonadal sheath cells, spermatheca, and hypodermal cells. YAP-1 is distributed in cytoplasm and nuclei. wts-1 (LATS ortholog) and ftt-2 (14-3-3 ortholog) knockdowns cause nuclear accumulation of YAP-1, supporting that the subcellular localization of YAP-1 is regulated in a similar way as that of YAP. Heat shock also causes the nuclear accumulation of YAP-1 but after heat shock, YAP-1 translocates to cytoplasm. Knockdowns of DAF-21 (HSP90 ortholog) and HSF-1block the nuclear export of YAP-1 during this recovery. YAP-1 overexpression is beneficial for thermotolerance, whereas YAP-1 hyperactivity induced by wts-1 and ftt-2 knockdowns is deleterious on thermal response and yap-1 deficiency promotes health aging. In short, YAP-1 partially shares basal characters with mammalian YAP and plays a role in thermal stress response and healthy aging.

Abstract: Transformed cancer cells have an altered metabolism, characterized by a shift towards aerobic glycolysis, referred to as ‘the Warburg phenotype’. A change in flux through mitochondrial OXPHOS and cytosolic pathways for ATP production and a gain of capacity for biomass production in order to sustain the needs for altered growth and morphodynamics are typically involved in this global rewiring of cancer cell metabolism. Characteristically, these changes in metabolism are accompanied by enhanced uptake of nutrients like glucose and glutamine. Here we focus on the relationship between cell metabolism and cell dynamics, in particular the formation and function of invadopodia, specialized structures for focal degradation of the extracellular matrix. Since we recently found presence of enzymes that are active in glycolysis and associated pathways in invadopodia, we hypothesize that metabolic adaptation and invadopodia formation are linked processes. We give an overview on the background for this idea and show for the first time that extracellular matrix degradation by invadopodia can be differentially manipulated, without effects on cell proliferation, by use of metabolic inhibitors or changes in nutrient composition of cell culture media. We conclude that cell metabolism and carbohydrate availability, especially pyruvate, are involved in fuelling of invadopodia formation and activity.

Abstract: Bacterial type II toxin–antitoxins (TAs) are two-component systems that modulate growth in response to specific stress conditions, thus promoting adaptation and persistence. The major human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis potentially encodes 75 TAs and it has been proposed that persistence induced by active toxins might be relevant for its pathogenesis. In this work, we focus on the newly discovered toxin–antitoxin–chaperone (TAC) system of M. tuberculosis, an atypical stress-responsive TA system tightly controlled by a molecular chaperone that shows similarity to the canonical SecB chaperone involved in Sec-dependent protein export in Gram-negative bacteria. We performed a large-scale genome screening to reconstruct the evolutionary history of TAC systems and found that TAC is not restricted to mycobacteria and seems to have disseminated in diverse taxonomic groups by horizontal gene transfer. Our results suggest that TAC chaperones are evolutionary related to the solitary chaperone SecB and have diverged to become specialized toward their cognate antitoxins.

Abstract: Due to the lack of an N-terminal signal peptide, SerpinB2 (plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2) accumulates in cells and only a small percentage of it is secreted. The extracellular concentration of SerpinB2 significantly increases during inflammation. In the present study we investigated the mechanism with which SerpinB2 can be secreted from endothelial cells activated with LPS. We evaluated the intracellular distribution of SerpinB2 by double immunogold labeling followed by a high resolution electron microscopy analysis. We found that SerpinB2 gathers in the vesicular structures and in the endothelial cell periphery. These vesicles stained positive for the trans-Golgi network marker TGN46, which is consistent with their formation by the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and Golgi-dependent pathways. SerpinB2 was delivered to the plasma membrane, apparently together with TGN46 in the same vesicles, which after fusion with the membranes released cargo. Secretion of SerpinB2 was partially inhibited by brefeldin A. The secreted SerpinB2 was predominantly in its nonglycosylated 43kDa form as evaluated by Western immunoblotting. Our data suggest that increased expression of SerpinB2 by an inflammatory stimulus is sufficient to generate structures that resemble secretory vesicles. These vesicles may represent the mechanism by which high local concentrations of SerpinB2 are released at inflammation sites from endothelial cells.

Abstract: Abnormal structural alterations termed remodeling, including fibrosis and alveolar wall destruction, are important features of the pathophysiology of chronic airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) is enzymatically produced by cholesterol 25-hydorxylase (CH25H) in macrophages and is reported to be involved in the formation of arteriosclerosis. We previously demonstrated that the expression of CH25H and production of 25HC were increased in the lungs of COPD. However, the role of 25-HC in lung tissue remodeling is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of 25-HC on fibroblast-mediated tissue remodeling using human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) in vitro. 25-HC significantly augmented α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) (P<0.001) and collagen I (P<0.001) expression in HFL-1. 25-HC also significantly enhanced the release and activation of matrix metallaoproteinase (MMP)-2 (P<0.001) and MMP-9 (P<0.001) without any significant effect on the production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2. 25-HC stimulated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 production (P<0.01) and a neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibody restored these 25-HC-augmented pro-fibrotic responses. 25-HC significantly promoted the translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 into the nuclei (P<0.01), but not phospholylated-c-jun, a complex of activator protein-1. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB restored the 25-HC-augmented pro-fibrotic responses and TGF-β1 release. These results suggest that 25-HC could contribute to fibroblast-mediated lung tissue remodeling by promoting myofibroblast differentiation and the excessive release of extracellular matrix protein and MMPs via an NF-κB-TGF-β dependent pathway.

Abstract: Transfusion and iron chelation treatment have significantly reduced morbidity and improved survival of patients with thalassemia major. However, cardiac disease continues to be the most common cause of death. We report the left-ventricular ejection fraction, determined by echocardiography, in one hundred sixty-eight patients with thalassemia major followed for at least 5years who received continuous monotherapy with deferoxamine (N=108) or deferiprone (N=60). The statistical analysis, using the generalized estimating equations model, indicated that the group treated with deferiprone had a significantly better left-ventricular ejection fraction than did those treated with deferoxamine (coefficient 0.97; 95% CI 0.37; 1.6, p=0.002). The heart may be particularly sensitive to iron-induced mitochondrial damage because of the large number of mitochondria and its low level of antioxidants. Deferiprone, because of its lower molecular weight, might cross into heart mitochondria more efficiently, improving their activity and, thereby, myocardial cell function. Our findings indicate that the long-term administration of deferiprone significantly enhances left-ventricular function over time in comparison with deferoxamine treatment. However, because of limitations related to the design of this study, these findings should be confirmed in a prospective, randomized clinical trial.

Positive feedback regulation of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is mediated through Toll-like receptor 4-PI3K/Akt-glycogen synthase kinase-3β pathway,

Abstract: Alarmins, the endogenous molecules that recruit and activate innate immune cells, are considered as subgroups of damage-associated molecular patterns. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is one of putative alarmins together with high mobility group box 1, S100s, interleukin-1α, and annexins. It has cytokine-like functions as well as molecular chaperone functions. However, the cytokine function of Hsp70 has not been clear. Here, we demonstrated that there exists the positive feedback regulation of Hsp70 induction in innate immune cells. Heat stress (HS) increased intracellular Hsp70 (iHsp70) and it was actively released into extracellular space through the Golgi complex. Human recombinant Hsp70 (rhHsp70) up-regulated iHsp70 expression and induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). rhHsp70 rapidly activated Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Moreover, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) was inactivated by rhHsp70-induced Akt activation. Knockdown of TLR4 and overexpression of dominant negative TLR4 (DN-TLR4) suppressed the above effects of rhHsp70. The effects of rhHsp70 were not due to endotoxin contamination. Akt-dependent GSK-3β inactivation was responsible for iHsp70 induction by rhHsp70. Overexpression of DN-Akt or constitutively active GSK-3β or pretreatment of LY294002 inhibited rhHsp70-induced iHsp70 up-regulation, which was similar to the mechanism of HS-mediated induction of Hsp70. Thus, these data suggest the positive feedback regulatory mechanism of iHsp70 induction.

Abstract: Sickle cell anemia is common in the Middle East and India where the HbS gene is sometimes associated with the Arab-Indian (AI) β-globin gene (HBB) cluster haplotype. In this haplotype of sickle cell anemia, fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels are 3–4 fold higher than those found in patients with HbS haplotypes of African origin. Little is known about the genetic elements that modulate HbF in AI haplotype patients. We therefore studied Saudi HbS homozygotes with the AI haplotype (mean HbF 19.2±7.0%, range 3.6 to 39.6%) and employed targeted genotyping of polymorphic sites to explore cis- and trans- acting elements associated with high HbF expression. We also described sequences which appear to be unique to the AI haplotype for which future functional studies are needed to further define their role in HbF modulation. All cases, regardless of HbF concentration, were homozygous for AI haplotype-specific elements cis to HBB. SNPs in BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB that were associated with HbF in other populations explained only 8.8% of the variation in HbF. KLF1 polymorphisms associated previously with high HbF were not present in the 44 patients tested. More than 90% of the HbF variance in sickle cell patients with the AI haplotype remains unexplained by the genetic loci that we studied. The dispersion of HbF levels among AI haplotype patients suggests that other genetic elements modulate the effects of the known cis- and trans-acting regulators. These regulatory elements, which remain to be discovered, might be specific in the Saudi and some other populations where HbF levels are especially high.

Abstract: Mutations in nuclear envelope proteins are linked to an increasing number of human diseases, called envelopathies. Mutations in the inner nuclear membrane protein emerin lead to X-linked Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, characterized by muscle weakness or wasting. Conversely, mutations in nuclear envelope protein MAN1 are linked to bone and skin disorders. Both proteins share a highly conserved domain, called LEM-domain. LEM proteins are known to interact with Barrier-to-autointegration factor and several transcription factors. Most envelopathies are tissue-specific, but knowledge on the physiological roles of related LEM proteins is still unclear. For this reason, we investigated the roles of MAN1 and emerin during Xenopus laevis organogenesis. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of MAN1 revealed that MAN1 is essential for the formation of eye, skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues. The MAN1 knockdown could be compensated by ectopic expression of emerin, leading to a proper organ development. Further investigations revealed that MAN1 is involved in regulation of genes essential for organ development and tissue homeostasis. Thereby our work supports that LEM proteins might be involved in signalling essential for organ development during early embryogenesis and suggests that loss of MAN1 may cause muscle and retina specific diseases.

Abstract: Introduction
Helicobacter pylori infection is one of the main causes of peptic ulcer. There are some blood groups acting as receptors for the pathogen. Based on this view and previous attempts, we tried to examine the relationship between Lewis blood group and H. pylori infection.
Materials and method
Blood and saliva samples were collected from 60 patients with established peptic ulcer induced by H. pylori. Secretory status of each patient was determined by both direct agglutination and saliva tests.
Results
Seventy-two percent of the patients were secretor and expressed Lewis B antigen. This rate in control group was 61%. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two groups.
Conclusion
This study did not find any correlation between Leb antigen expression and presence of H. pylori-induced peptic ulcer. It is now recommended that other factors like Lewisx and sialyl Lewisx should be investigated in binding, colonization and virulence of H. pylori infection in the future.

Abstract: α0-thalassemia is the most severe form of α-thalassemia alleles found among Southeast Asian and Chinese populations and can cause a fatal condition known as hemoglobin Bart's hydrops fetalis and hemoglobin H disease. In order to provide the molecular epidemiological characteristic of α0-thalassemia in northeast Thailand, a total of 12,525 blood specimens referred to our center at Khon Kaen University in northeast Thailand during October 2008 to January 2012 were studied. Hematological parameters were recorded and DNA deletions causing α0-thalassemia were examined by PCR related techniques. Among 12,525 samples examined, α0-thalassemia alleles were identified in 1,873 (15.0%) samples, including 1855 (14.8%) cases with Southeast Asian (−−SEA) deletion and 18 cases (0.2%) with THAI deletion (−−THAI). As many as twenty genotypes were encountered. Hb profiles and hematological parameters were comparatively presented. Data on prevalence, molecular features and phenotypic expression of α0-thalassemia should prove useful in a carrier screening and a prevention and control program of this common genetic disorder in the region.

Abstract: Down syndrome (DS), or Trisomy 21 (T21) syndrome, one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities, is caused by an extra duplication of chromosome 21. In studies of neuron development, experimental models based on human cells are considered to be the most desired and accurate for basic research. The generation of diseased induced pluripotetn stem (iPS) cell is a critical step in understanding the developmental stages of complex neuronal diseases. Here, we generated human DS iPS cell lines from second trimester amniotic fluid (AF) cells with T21 by co-expressing Yamanaka factors through lentiviral delivery and subsequently differentiated them into neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) for further analyses. T21 AF-iPS cells were characterized for the expression of pluripotent markers and for their ability to differentiate into all three germ layers by forming embryoid bodies in vitro and teratomas in vivo. The T21 AF-iPS cells maintained their unique pattern of chromosomal karyotypes: three pairs of chromosome 21. The level of amyloid precursor protein was significantly increased in NPCs derived from T21 AF-iPS cells compared with NPCs from normal AF-iPS cells. The expression levels of miR-155 and miR-802 in T21 AF-iPS-NPCs were highly elevated in the presence of low expression of MeCP2. We observed that T21 iPS-NPCs generated fewer neurons compared with controls. T21 iPS-NPCs exhibit developmental defects during neurogenesis. Our findings suggest that T21 AF-iPS cells serve as a good source to further elucidate the impairment neurogenesis of DS and the onset of Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Multipotent human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are uniquely suited for the growing field of regenerative medicine due to their ease of isolation, expansion, and transplantation. However, during ex vivo expansion necessary to obtain clinically relevant cell quantities, hMSCs undergo fundamental changes culminating in cellular senescence. The molecular changes as hMSCs transition into senescence have been well characterized, but few studies have focused on the mechanical properties that govern many processes necessary for therapeutic efficacy. We show that before detectable differences in classical senescence markers emerge, single-cell mechanical and cytoskeletal properties reveal a subpopulation of ‘non-functioning’ hMSCs that appears after even limited expansion. This subpopulation, characterized by a loss of dynamic cytoskeletal stiffening and morphological flexibility in response to chemotactic signals grows with extended culture resulting in overall decreased hMSC motility and ability to contract collagen gels. These changes were mitigated with cytoskeletal inhibition. Finally, a xenographic wound healing model was used to demonstrate that these in vitro differences correlate with decreased ability of hMSCs to aid in wound closure in vivo. These data illustrate the importance of analyzing not only the molecular markers, but also mechanical markers of hMSCs as they are investigated for potential therapeutics.

Abstract: Neural progenitor cells have been proposed as a therapy for central nervous system disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and trauma injuries, however their accessibility is a major limitation. We recently isolated Tuj1+ cells from skeletal muscle culture of Nestin–GFP transgenic mice however whether they form functional neurons in the brain is not yet known. Additionally, their isolation from nontransgenic species and identification of their ancestors is unknown. This gap of knowledge precludes us from studying their role as a valuable alternative to neural progenitors. Here, we identified two pericyte subtypes, type-1 and type-2, using a double transgenic Nestin–GFP/NG2–DsRed mouse and demonstrated that Nestin–GFP+/Tuj1+ cells derive from type-2 Nestin–GFP+/NG2–DsRed+/CD146+ pericytes located in the skeletal muscle interstitium. These cells are bipotential as they generate either Tuj1+ cells when cultured with muscle cells or become “classical” α-SMA+pericytes when cultured alone. In contrast, type-1 Nestin–GFP−/NG2–DsRed+/CD146+ pericytes generate α-SMA+pericytes but not Tuj1+ cells. Interestingly, type-2 pericyte derived Tuj1+ cells retain some pericytic markers (CD146+/PDGFRβ+/NG2+). Given the potential application of Nestin–GFP+/NG2–DsRed+/Tuj1+ cells for cell therapy, we found a surface marker, the nerve growth factor receptor, which is expressed exclusively in these cells and can be used to identify and isolate them from mixed cell populations in nontransgenic species for clinical purposes.

Abstract: Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) has a critical role in bone formation and osteoblast differentiation, but very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of ascorbic acid entry into bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the identity of the transport system that is responsible for the uptake of ascorbic acid into bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). First, we examined the expression of the two known isoforms of the sodium-coupled ascorbic acid transporter, namely SVCT1 and SVCT2, in BMSCs (Lin−ve Sca1+ve) and bone at the mRNA level. Only SVCT2 mRNA was detected in BMSCs and bone. Uptake of ascorbic acid in BMSCs was Na+-dependent and saturable. In order to define the role of SVCT2 in BMSC differentiation into osteoblasts, BMSCs were stimulated with osteogenic media for different time intervals, and the activity of SVCT2 was monitored by ascorbic acid uptake. SVCT2 expression was up-regulated during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs; the expression was maximal at the earliest phase of differentiation. Subsequently, osteogenesis was inhibited in BMSCs upon knock-down of SVCT2 by lentivirus shRNA. We also found that the expression of the SVCT2 could be negatively or positively modulated by the presence of oxidant (Sin-1) or antioxidant (Ascorbic acid) compounds, respectively, in BMSCs. Furthermore, we found that this transporter is also regulated with age in mouse bone. These data show that SVCT2 plays a vital role in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and that its expression is altered under conditions associated with redox reaction. Our findings could be relevant to bone tissue engineering and bone related diseases such as osteoporosis in which oxidative stress and aging plays important role.

Abstract: In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), secretory and membrane proteins are properly folded and modified, and the failure of these processes leads to ER stress. At the same time, unfolded protein response (UPR) genes are activated to maintain homeostasis. Despite the thorough characterization of the individual gene regulation of UPR genes to date, further investigation of the mutual regulation among UPR genes is required to understand the complex mechanism underlying the ER stress response. In this study, we aimed to reveal a gene regulatory network formed by UPR genes, including immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), C/EBP [CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein]-homologous protein (CHOP), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and ATF4. For this purpose, we focused on promoter-luciferase reporters for BiP, XBP1, and CHOP genes, which bear an ER stress response element (ERSE), and p5 × ATF6-GL3, which bears an unfolded protein response element (UPRE). We demonstrated that the luciferase activities of the BiP and CHOP promoters were upregulated by all the UPR genes, whereas those of the XBP1 promoter and p5 × ATF6-GL3 were upregulated by all the UPR genes except for BiP, CHOP, and ATF4 in HeLa cells. Therefore, an ERSE- and UPRE-centered gene regulatory network of UPR genes could be responsible for the robustness of the ER stress response. Finally, we revealed that BiP protein was degraded when cells were treated with DNA-damaging reagents, such as etoposide and doxorubicin; this finding suggests that the expression level of BiP is tightly regulated at the post-translational level, rather than at the transcriptional level, in the presence of DNA damage.

Abstract: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold promise for the treatment of motoneuron diseases because of their distinct features including pluripotency, self-derivation and potential ability to differentiate into motoneurons. However, it is still unknown whether human iPSC-derived motoneurons can functionally innervate target muscles in vivo, which is the definitive sign of successful cell therapy for motoneuron diseases. In the present study, we demonstrated that human iPSCs derived from mesenchymal cells of the umbilical cord possessed a high yield in neural differentiation. Using a chemically-defined in vitro system, human iPSCs efficiently differentiated into motoneurons which displayed typical morphology, expressed specific molecules, and generated repetitive trains of action potentials. When transplanted into the injured musculocutaneous nerve of rats, they survived robustly, extended axons along the nerve, and formed functional connections with the target muscle (biceps brachii), thereby protecting the muscle from atrophy. Our study provides evidence for the first time that human iPSC-derived motoneurons are truly functional not only in vitro but also in vivo, and they have potential for stem cell-based therapies for motoneuron diseases.

Abstract: The Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema and various degrees of immune deficiency caused by mutations in the WAS gene, which encodes the WASP protein, the expression of which is restricted to haematopoietic cells. Mild allelic variants are associated with X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT). Female carriers tend in general to be asymptomatic as a consequence of a positive selection of cells with an active normal X chromosome, which results in a non-random inactivation of the mutated gene in affected cell lineages. We report on six female members of the same family carrying the mutated WAS allele p.V332A, which is known to be associated with XLT. One of them had presented severe thrombocytopenia from birth. Western blotting showed the WASP protein in peripheral blood cells to be normal in size and expression, and scanning electron microscopy revealed a normal distribution of microvilli on T cells. X-chromosome inactivation-pattern analysis showed total inactivation of the non-mutated paternal X chromosome in the patient's peripheral blood cells. All the other female family members were healthy and presented varying X-chromosome inactivation patterns, ranging from random X chromosome inactivation to total X-chromosome inactivation of the mutated chromosome. Our results in these female carriers of p.V332A show that manifestation of the disease requires a total inactivation of the non-mutated X chromosome and allow us to confirm that clinical manifestations in female carriers are highly dependent not only on the mutation characteristics but also on the X-chromosome inactivation pattern of affected line.

Abstract: Background
β-Thalassemia is a disorder caused by mutations at the hemoglobin β-gene (HBB) locus. Its most important manifestation, the major form, is characterized by severe hypochromic and hemolytic anemia and is inherited in an autosomal recessive mode. In Gaza Strip, Palestine 0.02% of the population has been identified as β-thalassemia major.
Design and methods
An assessment of mutations was performed in 49 transfusion dependent patients with β-thalassemia major and in 176 β-thalassemia carriers diagnosed with a mean erythrocyte cell volume (MCV) <80fl and a proportion of HbA2>3.5%. In addition 39 individuals suspicious for β-thalassemia carrier status due to a reduced MCV (<80fl) but a normal HBA2 were screened.
Results
By screening with three hybridization assays a proportion of 80% of the thalassemic chromosomes from patients and carriers was identified to carry five different mutations of the hemoglobin (Hb) β-gene. Subsequent DNA sequencing confirmed these and revealed further 9% of the chromosomes to be affected by other mutations. In addition six chromosomes from suspicious carriers were detected to carry β-thalassemia mutations. Of the 15 different HBB mutations identified the variant IVS-I-110 G>A was the most frequent mutation identified in 34% of the thalassemic chromosomes, followed by IVS-I-1 G>A, IVS-I-6 T>C, Codon 39 C>T, and Codon 37 G>A. Three novel HBB variants were discovered by direct sequencing of the gene: 5′ UTR-50 (−/G), 5′ UTR-43 C>T, and IVS-II-26 T>G.
Conclusions
The spectrum of HBB mutations described is of the Mediterranean type whereby the allele frequencies of the most common mutations differ from those, which were previously described for the population of the Gaza Strip and other Palestinian populations. The data presented may promote the introduction of molecular testing to the Palestinian premarital screening program for β-thalassemia in Gaza Strip, which will improve the screening protocol and genetic counseling in the future.

The influence of the BCL11A polymorphism on the phenotype of patients with beta thalassemia could be affected by the beta globin locus control region and/or the Xmn1-HBG2 genotypic background,

Abstract: To study the influence of the β globin locus control region (LCR) genotypic background on the phenotype modifying role of BCL11A polymorphisms, 100 cases of thalassemia, 48 homozygous for the A allele and 52 homozygous for the G allele at the 5′HS4-LCR palindromic polymorphic site were genotyped for two BCL11A single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs11886868 and rs766432) in the intronic region of this gene. The effect of these polymorphisms on HbF variation was also examined in 122 normal individuals. The 5′HS4-LCR had the most significant role in determining the phenotype of these thalassemia patients. BCL11A polymorphisms showed a significant role in determining the phenotype of patients homozygous for the G allele at 5′HS4-LCR. However, the majority of patients homozygous for the A allele at 5′HS4-LCR, showed a severe phenotype, regardless of the BCL11A genotype. These results, without undermining the strength of BCL11A as a silencer of the γ globin gene, suggest that the LCR background, by governing the state of BCL11A binding to this region, plays a more significant role in determining the thalassemia phenotype than the level of BCL11A protein expression, that might be influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms in intronic regions of the BCL11A gene. Functional studies to confirm the interactions between BCL11A and LCR could be useful in designing pharmacogenetic strategies for the treatment of beta thalassemia major.

Abstract: Acquisition of metastatic potential is accompanied by changes in cell surface N-glycosylation. One of the best-studied changes is increased expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V enzyme (GnT-V) and its products, β1,6-branched N-linked oligosaccharides, observed in the tumorigenesis of many cancers. In this study we demonstrate that during the transition from the vertical growth phase (VGP) (WM793 cell line) to the metastatic stage (WM1205Lu line), β1,6 glycosylation of melanoma cell surface proteins increases as a consequence of elevated expression of the GnT-V-encoding Mgat-5 gene. Treatment with swainsonine led to reduced cell motility on fibronectin in both cell lines; the effect was stronger in metastatic cells, probably due to the higher content of GlcNAc β1,6-branched glycans on the main fibronectin receptors – integrins α5β1 and α3β1. Our results show that GlcNAc β1,6 N-glycosylation of cell surface receptors, which increases with the aggressiveness of melanoma cells, is an important factor influencing melanoma cell migration.

Abstract: Approximately 80% of α-thalassemia mutations are deletions in the α-globin cluster on chromosome 16 and about 10% of β-thalassemia mutations are deletions in the β-globin gene cluster on chromosome 11. Larger deletions involving the β-globin gene cluster lead to (δβ)-, (γδβ)-, (εγδβ)-thalassemia, or hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was applied to screen for deletions in the α- and β-globin gene clusters not detected by routine gap-PCR. In total, in 13 patients with hypochromia and inclusion bodies (IBs) the α-globin gene cluster was analyzed and in 13 patients with increased fetal hemoglobin levels with or without hypochromia the β-globin gene cluster was examined. All samples were subsequently investigated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). In 9 out of 13 patients deletions of the α-globin gene cluster were identified; 5 of these deletions remove the entire α-globin cluster and extend to the telomere. Additional sequencing of the remaining 4 patients revealed polyadenylation mutation in 1 of them. 7 deletions were identified in the β-globin gene cluster in 13 patients. Additional sequencing of the remaining 6 patients revealed mutations in one of the γ-globin gene promoters in 3 of them and a KLF1-mutation in 1 of them. Array CGH is a reliable method to screen for deletions in thalassemia and hemoglobinopathy. The method offers the advantage of a high resolution with the possibility to characterize breakpoints on sequence level.

Abstract: Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a familiar fatal progressive degenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, and recurrent stroke in young adults. Pathological features include a dramatic reduction of brain vascular smooth muscle cells and severe arteriopathy with the presence of granular osmophilic material in the arterial walls. Here we have investigated the cellular and mitochondrial function in vascular smooth muscle cell lines (VSMCs) established from CADASIL mutation carriers (R133C) and healthy controls. We found significantly lower proliferation rates in CADASIL VSMC as compared to VSMC from controls. Cultured CADASIL VSMCs were not more vulnerable than control cells to a number of toxic substances. Morphological studies showed reduced mitochondrial connectivity and increased number of mitochondria in CADASIL VSMCs. Transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrated increased irregular and abnormal mitochondria in CADASIL VSMCs. Measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) showed a lower percentage of fully functional mitochondria in CADASIL VSMCs. For a number of genes previously reported to be changed in CADASIL VSMCs, immunoblotting analysis demonstrated a significantly reduced SOD1 expression. These findings suggest that alteration of proliferation and mitochondrial function in CADASIL VSMCs might have an effect on vital cellular functions important for CADASIL pathology.

Abstract: Erythropoiesis, a process of erythroid production, is controlled by several factors including oxygen level. In this study, the effect of oxygen tension on erythropoiesis was investigated in K562 erythroleukemic cell line and erythroid progenitor cells derived from normal and β-thalassemia/hemoglobin (Hb) E individuals. The enhanced erythroid differentiation specific markers including increased levels of α-, β- and γ-globin gene expressions, numbers of HbF positive cells and the presence of glycophorin A surface marker were observed during cell culture under hypoxic atmosphere. The result also showed that miR-210, one of the hypoxia-induced miRNAs, was up-regulated in K562 and β-thalassemia/HbE progenitor cells cultured under hypoxic condition. Inhibition of miR-210 expression leads to reduction of the globin gene expression and delayed maturation in K562 and erythroid progenitor cells. This indicated that miR-210 contributes to hypoxia-induced erythroid differentiation in both K562 cells and β-thalassemia/HbE erythroid progenitor cells.
