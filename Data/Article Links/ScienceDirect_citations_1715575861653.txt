Abstract: Summary
Tight junctions (TJs) of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) play a pivotal role in maintaining the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity; however, precise regulation of TJs stability in response to physiological and pathological stimuli remains elusive. Here, using RNA immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (RIP-seq) and functional characterization, we identify SNHG12, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), as being critical for maintaining the BBB integrity by directly interacting with TJ protein occludin. The interaction between SNHG12 and occludin is oxygen adaptive and could block Itch (an E3 ubiquitin ligase)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of occludin in human BMECs. Genetic ablation of endothelial Snhg12 in mice results in occludin reduction and BBB leakage and significantly aggravates hypoxia-induced BBB disruption. The detrimental effects of hypoxia on BBB could be alleviated by exogenous SNHG12 overexpression in brain endothelium. Together, we identify a direct TJ modulator lncRNA SNHG12 that is critical for the BBB integrity maintenance and oxygen adaption.

Abstract: Summary
Animals must adapt their growth to fluctuations in nutrient availability to ensure proper development. These adaptations often rely on specific nutrient-sensing tissues that control whole-body physiology through inter-organ communication. While the signaling mechanisms that underlie this communication are well studied, the contributions of metabolic alterations in nutrient-sensing tissues are less clear. Here, we show how the reprogramming of adipose mitochondria controls whole-body growth in Drosophila larvae. We find that dietary nutrients alter fat-body mitochondrial morphology to lower their bioenergetic activity, leading to rewiring of fat-body glucose metabolism. Strikingly, we find that genetic reduction of mitochondrial bioenergetics just in the fat body is sufficient to accelerate body growth and development. These growth effects are caused by inhibition of the fat-derived secreted peptides ImpL2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)/Eiger, leading to enhanced systemic insulin signaling. Our work reveals how reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism in one nutrient-sensing tissue can couple nutrient availability to whole-body growth.

Abstract: Summary
K. pneumoniae sequence type 258 (Kp ST258) is a major cause of healthcare-associated pneumonia. However, it remains unclear how it causes protracted courses of infection in spite of its expression of immunostimulatory lipopolysaccharide, which should activate a brisk inflammatory response and bacterial clearance. We predicted that the metabolic stress induced by the bacteria in the host cells shapes an immune response that tolerates infection. We combined in situ metabolic imaging and transcriptional analyses to demonstrate that Kp ST258 activates host glutaminolysis and fatty acid oxidation. This response creates an oxidant-rich microenvironment conducive to the accumulation of anti-inflammatory myeloid cells. In this setting, metabolically active Kp ST258 elicits a disease-tolerant immune response. The bacteria, in turn, adapt to airway oxidants by upregulating the type VI secretion system, which is highly conserved across ST258 strains worldwide. Thus, much of the global success of Kp ST258 in hospital settings can be explained by the metabolic activity provoked in the host that promotes disease tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cell (Treg) lymphatic migration is required for resolving inflammation and prolonging allograft survival. Focusing on Treg interactions with lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), we dissect mechanisms and functional consequences of Treg transendothelial migration (TEM). Using three genetic mouse models of pancreatic islet transplantation, we show that Treg lymphotoxin (LT) αβ and LEC LTβ receptor (LTβR) signaling are required for efficient Treg migration and suppressive function to prolong allograft survival. Inhibition of LT signaling increases Treg conversion to Foxp3loCD25lo exTregs. In a transwell-based model of TEM across polarized LECs, non-migrated Tregs become exTregs. Such conversion is regulated by LTβR nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling in LECs, which increases interleukin-6 (IL-6) production and drives exTreg conversion. Migrating Tregs are ectonucleotidase CD39hi and resist exTreg conversion in an adenosine-receptor-2A-dependent fashion. Human Tregs migrating across human LECs behave similarly. These molecular interactions can be targeted for therapeutic manipulation of immunity and suppression.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted protein degradation methods offer a unique avenue to assess a protein’s function in a variety of model systems. Recently, these approaches have been applied to mammalian cell culture models, enabling unprecedented temporal control of protein function. However, the efficacy of these systems at the tissue and organismal levels in vivo is not well established. Here, we tested the functionality of the degradation tag (dTAG) degron system in mammalian development. We generated a homozygous knock-in mouse with a FKBP12F36V tag fused to negative elongation factor b (Nelfb) locus, a ubiquitously expressed regulator of transcription. In our validation of targeted endogenous protein degradation across mammalian development and adulthood, we demonstrate that irrespective of the route of administration the dTAG system is non-toxic, rapid, and efficient in embryos from the zygote-to-mid-gestation stages. Additionally, acute depletion of NELFB revealed a specific role in zygote-to-2-cell development and zygotic genome activation (ZGA).

Abstract: Summary
The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a contractile nanomachine widely distributed among pathogenic and commensal Gram-negative bacteria. The T6SS is used for inter-bacterial competition to directly kill competing species; however, its importance during bacterial infection in vivo remains poorly understood. We report that the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, used as a model for human pathogenic Escherichia coli, harbors two functional T6SSs. C. rodentium employs its T6SS-1 to colonize the murine gastrointestinal tract by targeting commensal Enterobacteriaceae. We identify VgrG1 as a C. rodentium T6SS antibacterial effector, which exhibits toxicity in E. coli. Conversely, commensal prey species E. coli Mt1B1 employs two T6SSs of its own to counter C. rodentium colonization. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the T6SS is a potent weapon during bacterial competition and is used by both invading pathogens and resident microbiota to fight for a niche in the hostile gut environment.

Abstract: Summary
γ-oscillatory activity is ubiquitous across brain areas. Numerous studies have suggested that γ-synchrony is likely to enhance the transmission of sensory information. However, direct causal evidence is still lacking. Here, we test this hypothesis in the mouse olfactory system, where local GABAergic granule cells (GCs) in the olfactory bulb shape mitral/tufted cell (MTC) excitatory output from the olfactory bulb. By optogenetically modulating GC activity, we successfully dissociate MTC γ-synchronization from its firing rates. Recording of odor responses in downstream piriform cortex neurons shows that increasing MTC γ-synchronization enhances cortical neuron odor-evoked firing rates, reduces response variability, and improves odor ensemble representation. These gains occur despite a reduction in MTC firing rates. Furthermore, reducing MTC γ-synchronization without changing the MTC firing rates, by suppressing GC activity, degrades piriform cortex odor-evoked responses. These findings provide causal evidence that increased γ-synchronization enhances the transmission of sensory information between two brain regions.

Abstract: Summary
Although the antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination has been studied extensively at the polyclonal level using immune sera, little has been reported on the antibody response at the monoclonal level. Here, we isolate a panel of 44 anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from an individual who received two doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine at a 12-week interval. We show that, despite a relatively low serum neutralization titer, Spike-reactive IgG+ B cells are still detectable 9 months post-boost. Furthermore, mAbs with potent neutralizing activity against the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Alpha, Gamma, Beta, Delta, and Omicron) are present. The vaccine-elicited neutralizing mAbs form eight distinct competition groups and bind epitopes overlapping with neutralizing mAbs elicited following SARS-CoV-2 infection. AZD1222-elicited mAbs are more mutated than mAbs isolated from convalescent donors 1–2 months post-infection. These findings provide molecular insights into the AZD1222 vaccine-elicited antibody response.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is effective in lymphoid malignancies, but there has been limited data in myeloid cancers. Here, we start with a CD27-based CAR to target CD70 (“native”) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and we find modest efficacy in vivo, consistent with prior reports. We then use orthogonal approaches to increase binding on both the tumor and CAR-T cell sides of the immune synapse: a pharmacologic approach (azacitidine) to increase antigen density of CD70 in myeloid tumors, and an engineering approach to stabilize binding of the CAR to CD70. To accomplish the latter, we design a panel of hinge-modified regions to mitigate cleavage of the extracellular portion of CD27. Our CD8 hinge and transmembrane-modified CD70 CAR-T cells are less prone to cleavage, have enhanced binding avidity, and increased expansion, leading to more potent in vivo activity. This enhanced CD70-targeted CAR is a promising candidate for further clinical development.

Abstract: Summary
Phospholipid biosynthesis plays a role in mediating membrane-to-histone communication that influences metabolic decisions. Upon nutrient deprivation, phospholipid methylation generates a starvation signal in the form of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) depletion, leading to dynamic changes in histone methylation. Here we show that the SAM-responsive methylation of H3K36 is critical for metabolic adaptation to nutrient starvation in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that mutants deficient in H3K36 methylation exhibit defects in membrane integrity and pyrimidine metabolism and lose viability quickly under starvation. Adjusting the synthesis of phospholipids potently rewires metabolic pathways for nucleotide synthesis and boosts the production of antioxidants, ameliorating the defects resulting from the loss of H3K36 methylation. We further demonstrate that H3K36 methylation reciprocally regulates phospholipid synthesis by influencing redox balance. Our study illustrates an adaptive mechanism whereby phospholipid synthesis entails a histone modification to reprogram metabolism for adaptation in a eukaryotic model organism.

Abstract: Summary
Motor skill learning requires the activity of the dorsal striatum, with a differential global implication of the dorsomedial and dorsolateral territories. We investigate here whether and how specific striatal neurons encode the acquisition and consolidation of a motor skill. Using ex vivo two-photon calcium imaging after rotarod training, we report that highly active (HA) striatal populations arise from distinct spatiotemporal reorganization in the dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral (DLS) striatum networks and are correlated with learning performance. The DMS overall activity decreases in early training, with few and sparsely distributed HA cells, while the DLS shows a progressive and long-lasting formation of HA cell clusters. These reorganizations result from reinforcement of synaptic connections to the DMS and anatomical rearrangements to the DLS. Targeted silencing of DMS or DLS HA cells with the cFos-TRAP strategy strongly impairs individual performance. Our data reveal that discrete domains of striatal populations encode acquisition and long-lasting retention of a motor skill.

Abstract: Summary
In this study, we establish a population-based human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) drug screening platform for toxicity assessment. After recruiting 1,000 healthy donors and screening for high-frequency human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes, we identify 13 HLA-homozygous “super donors” to represent the population. These “super donors” are also expected to represent at least 477,611,135 of the global population. By differentiating these representative hiPSCs into cardiomyocytes and neurons we show their utility in a high-throughput toxicity screen. To validate hit compounds, we demonstrate dose-dependent toxicity of the hit compounds and assess functional modulation. We also show reproducible in vivo drug toxicity results using mouse models with select hit compounds. This study shows the feasibility of using a population-based hiPSC drug screening platform to assess cytotoxicity, which can be used as an innovative tool to study inter-population differences in drug toxicity and adverse drug reactions in drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic colonization is the primary cause of death from colorectal cancer (CRC). We employed genome-scale in vivo short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening and validation to identify 26 promoters of CRC liver colonization. Among these genes, we identified a cluster that contains multiple targetable genes, including ITPR3, which promoted liver-metastatic colonization and elicited similar downstream gene expression programs. ITPR3 is a caffeine-sensitive inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor that releases calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and enhanced metastatic colonization by inducing expression of RELB, a transcription factor that is associated with non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Genetic, cell biological, pharmacologic, and clinical association studies revealed that ITPR3 and RELB drive CRC colony formation by promoting cell survival upon substratum detachment or hypoxic exposure. RELB was sufficient to drive colonization downstream of ITPR3. Our findings implicate the ITPR3/calcium/RELB axis in CRC metastatic colony formation and uncover multiple clinico-pathologically associated targetable proteins as drivers of CRC metastatic colonization.

Abstract: Tectoridin, isolated from the dry rhizome of iris, is a compound with multiple biological activities. However, its biological roles in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have still not been clearly elucidated. The aim of this study was to focus on the effects of tectoridin on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced human fibroblast‑like synoviocyte rheumatoid arthritis (HFLS‑RA) cells, and its associated mechanisms. After TNF-α stimulation, CCK8 and MTT assays, TUNEL assay and flow cytometry, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis were performed to check the cell proliferation, cell apoptosis and cycle analysis, and the expression of related proteins, respectively. Our results showed that tectoridin significantly hindered cell proliferation, S-to-G2/M phase transition and down-regulated Cyclind 1 and PCNA protein levels. Additionally, tectoridin markedly promoted apoptosis rates of HFSL-RA cells and elevated the expression levels of Cleaved Caspase-3 and Bax, while reduced the expression level of Bcl-2. Moreover, tectoridin reversed TNF-α-induced overexpression of MMPs and factors associated with the TLR4/NLRP3/NF-κB pathway. We conclude that tectoridin ameliorated TNF-α-induced proliferation and inflammation by inhibiting TLR4/NLRP3/NF-κB pathway. It might provide a new insight for the clinical application of RA.

Abstract: Summary
Although generating high neutralizing antibody levels is a key component of protective immunity after acute viral infection or vaccination, little is known about why some individuals generate high versus low neutralizing antibody titers. Here, we leverage the high-dimensional single-cell profiling capacity of mass cytometry to characterize the longitudinal cellular immune response to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in viremic blood donors in Puerto Rico. During acute ZIKV infection, we identify widely coordinated responses across innate and adaptive immune cell lineages. High frequencies of multiple activated cell types during acute infection are associated with high titers of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies 6 months post-infection, while stable immune features suggesting a cytotoxic-skewed immune set point are associated with low titers. Our study offers insight into the coordination of immune responses and identifies candidate cellular biomarkers that may offer predictive value in vaccine efficacy trials aimed at inducing high levels of antiviral neutralizing antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is dominant in many countries worldwide. The high number of spike mutations is responsible for the broad immune evasion from existing vaccines and antibody drugs. To understand this, we first present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of ACE2-bound SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike. Comparison to previous spike antibody structures explains how Omicron escapes these therapeutics. Secondly, we report structures of Omicron, Delta, and wild-type spikes bound to a patient-derived Fab antibody fragment (510A5), which provides direct evidence where antibody binding is greatly attenuated by the Omicron mutations, freeing spike to bind ACE2. Together with biochemical binding and 510A5 neutralization assays, our work establishes principles of binding required for neutralization and clearly illustrates how the mutations lead to antibody evasion yet retain strong ACE2 interactions. Structural information on spike with both bound and unbound antibodies collectively elucidates potential strategies for generation of therapeutic antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
The cytoskeleton is crucial for defining neuronal-type-specific dendrite morphologies. To explore how the complex interplay of actin-modulatory proteins (AMPs) can define neuronal types in vivo, we focused on the class III dendritic arborization (c3da) neuron of Drosophila larvae. Using computational modeling, we reveal that the main branches (MBs) of c3da neurons follow general models based on optimal wiring principles, while the actin-enriched short terminal branches (STBs) require an additional growth program. To clarify the cellular mechanisms that define this second step, we thus concentrated on STBs for an in-depth quantitative description of dendrite morphology and dynamics. Applying these methods systematically to mutants of six known and novel AMPs, we revealed the complementary roles of these individual AMPs in defining STB properties. Our data suggest that diverse dendrite arbors result from a combination of optimal-wiring-related growth and individualized growth programs that are neuron-type specific.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome has shown promise as a predictive biomarker for various diseases. However, the potential of gut microbiota for prospective risk prediction of liver disease has not been assessed. Here, we utilized shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing of a large population-based cohort (N > 7,000) with ∼15 years of follow-up in combination with machine learning to investigate the predictive capacity of gut microbial predictors individually and in conjunction with conventional risk factors for incident liver disease. Separately, conventional and microbial factors showed comparable predictive capacity. However, microbiome augmentation of conventional risk factors using machine learning significantly improved the performance. Similarly, disease-free survival analysis showed significantly improved stratification using microbiome-augmented models. Investigation of predictive microbial signatures revealed previously unknown taxa for liver disease, as well as those previously associated with hepatic function and disease. This study supports the potential clinical validity of gut metagenomic sequencing to complement conventional risk factors for prediction of liver diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses must effectively remodel host cellular pathways to replicate and evade immune defenses, and they must do so with limited genomic coding capacity. Targeting post-translational modification (PTM) pathways provides a mechanism by which viruses can broadly and rapidly transform a hostile host environment into a hospitable one. We use mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantify changes in protein abundance and two PTM types—phosphorylation and ubiquitination—in response to HIV-1 infection with viruses harboring targeted deletions of a subset of HIV-1 genes. PTM analysis reveals a requirement for Aurora kinase activity in HIV-1 infection and identified putative substrates of a phosphatase that is degraded during infection. Finally, we demonstrate that the HIV-1 Vpr protein inhibits histone H1 ubiquitination, leading to defects in DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
The critical role of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex in transcription is commonly attributed to its nucleosome sliding activity. Here, we have found that INO80 prefers to mobilize hexasomes over nucleosomes. INO80’s preference for hexasomes reaches up to ∼60 fold when flanking DNA overhangs approach ∼18-bp linkers in yeast gene bodies. Correspondingly, deletion of INO80 significantly affects the positions of hexasome-sized particles within yeast genes in vivo. Our results raise the possibility that INO80 promotes nucleosome sliding by dislodging an H2A-H2B dimer, thereby making a nucleosome transiently resemble a hexasome. We propose that this mechanism allows INO80 to rapidly mobilize nucleosomes at promoters and hexasomes within gene bodies. Rapid repositioning of hexasomes that are generated in the wake of transcription may mitigate spurious transcription. More generally, such versatility may explain how INO80 regulates chromatin architecture during the diverse processes of transcription, replication, and repair.

Abstract: Summary
RNA activation (RNAa) is an uncharacterized mechanism of transcriptional activation mediated by small RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs). A critical issue in RNAa research is that it is difficult to distinguish between changes in gene expression caused indirectly by post-transcriptional regulation and direct induction of gene expression by RNAa. Therefore, in this study, we seek to identify a key factor involved in RNAa, using the induction of ZMYND10 by miR-34a as a system to evaluate RNAa. We identify the positive transcription elongation factors CDK9 and DDX21, which form a complex with nuclear AGO and TNRC6A, as important transcriptional activators of RNAa. In addition, we find that inhibition of DDX21 suppresses RNAa by miR-34a and other miRNAs without inhibiting post-transcriptional regulation. Our findings reveal a strong connection between RNAa and release of paused Pol II, facilitating RNAa research by making it possible to separately analyze post-transcriptional regulation and RNAa.

Abstract: Summary
Peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) comprises heterogeneous lymphoid malignancies characterized by pleomorphic lymphocytes and variable inflammatory cell-rich tumor microenvironment. Genetic drivers in PTCL-NOS include genomic alterations affecting the VAV1 oncogene; however, their specific role and mechanisms in PTCL-NOS remain incompletely understood. Here we show that expression of Vav1-Myo1f, a recurrent PTCL-associated VAV1 fusion, induces oncogenic transformation of CD4+ T cells. Notably, mouse Vav1-Myo1f lymphomas show T helper type 2 features analogous to high-risk GATA3+ human PTCL. Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals that Vav1-Myo1f alters T cell differentiation and leads to accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment, a feature linked with aggressiveness in human PTCL. Importantly, therapeutic targeting of TAMs induces strong anti-lymphoma effects, highlighting the lymphoma cells’ dependency on the microenvironment. These results demonstrate an oncogenic role for Vav1-Myo1f in the pathogenesis of PTCL, involving deregulation in T cell polarization, and identify the lymphoma-associated macrophage-tumor microenvironment as a therapeutic target in PTCL.

Abstract: Summary
Neurexins (NRXNs) are key presynaptic cell adhesion molecules that regulate synapse formation and function via trans-synaptic interaction with postsynaptic ligands. Here, we generate cerebellar granule cell (CGC)-specific Nrxn triple-knockout (TKO) mice for complete deletion of all NRXNs. Unexpectedly, most CGCs die in these mice, and this requirement for NRXNs for cell survival is reproduced in cultured CGCs. The axons of cultured Nrxn TKO CGCs that are not in contact with a postsynaptic structure show defects in the formation of presynaptic protein clusters and in action-potential-induced Ca2+ influxes. These cells also show impaired secretion of depolarization-induced, fluorescence-tagged brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from their axons, and the cell-survival defect is rescued by the application of BDNF. These results suggest that CGC survival is maintained by autocrine neurotrophic factors and that NRXNs organize the presynaptic protein clusters and the autocrine neurotrophic-factor secretory machinery independent of contact with postsynaptic ligands.

Abstract: Summary
The switch from mitosis to meiosis ensures the successive formation of gametes. However, it remains unclear how meiotic initiation occurs within the context of chromatin. Recent studies have shown that zinc finger HIT-type containing 1 (Znhit1), a subunit of the SRCAP chromatin remodeling complex, plays essential roles in modulating the chromatin structure. Herein, we report that the germline-conditional deletion of Znhit1 in male mice specifically blocks meiotic initiation. We show that Znhit1 is required for meiotic prophase events, including synapsis, DNA double-strand break formation, and meiotic DNA replication. Mechanistically, Znhit1 controls the histone variant H2A.Z deposition, which facilitates the expression of meiotic genes, such as Meiosin, but not the expression of Stra8. Interestingly, Znhit1 deficiency disrupts the transcription bubbles of meiotic genes. Thus, our findings identify the essential role of Znhit1-dependent H2A.Z deposition in allowing activation of meiotic gene expression, thereby controlling the initiation of meiosis.

Abstract: Summary
The innate immune recognition of the malaria-causing pathogen Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) is not fully explored. Here, we identify the nucleoside 5ʹ-methylthioinosine (MTI), a Plasmodium-specific intermediate of the purine salvage pathway, as a pathogen-derived Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonist. Co-incubation of MTI with the TLR8 enhancer poly(dT) as well as synthetic or P. falciparum-derived RNA strongly increase its stimulatory activity. Of note, MTI generated from methylthioadenosine (MTA) by P. falciparum lysates activates TLR8 when MTI metabolism is inhibited by immucillin targeting the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PfPNP). Importantly, P. falciparum-infected red blood cells incubated with MTI or cultivated with MTA and immucillin lead to TLR8-dependent interleukin-6 (IL-6) production in human monocytes. Our data demonstrate that the nucleoside MTI is a natural human TLR8 ligand with possible in vivo relevance for innate sensing of P. falciparum.

Abstract: Summary
It remains unclear how the pro-immunogenic maturation of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) abrogates their tolerogenic functions. Here, we report that the loss of tolerogenic functions depends on the rapid death of BTLAhi cDC1s, which, in the steady state, are present in systemic peripheral lymphoid organs and promote tolerance that limits subsequent immune responses. A canonical inducer of maturation, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), initiates a burst of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production and the resultant acute death of BTLAhi cDC1s mediated by tumor necrosis factor receptor 1. The ablation of these individual tolerogenic cDCs is amplified by TNF-α produced by neighboring cells. This loss of tolerogenic cDCs is transient, accentuating the restoration of homeostatic conditions through biological turnover of cDCs in vivo. Therefore, our results reveal that the abrogation of tolerogenic functions during an acute immunogenic maturation depends on an ablation of the tolerogenic cDC population, resulting in a dynamic remodeling of the cDC functional landscape.

Abstract: The intracellular endomembrane system contributes to maintaining cell homeostasis. We investigate the dynamic of exosomal and autophagy pathways in Human Umbilical Vein Cells (HUVECs) following incubation with H2O2 in vitro. Cellular senescence was induced to HUVECs using 100 µM H2O2. ELISA and AChE assay was used to calculate the number of exosomes. Exosomes were isolated and characterized by dynamic light scattering, flow cytometry, and SEM. Transcript and protein levels of genes involved in the exosomal and autophagy pathways were measured by real-time PCR (Q-PCR) and western blotting. Subcellular distribution of CD63 was monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy. We also measured the expression of miR-182 and miR-155 by qPCR assay. Results showed that secretion of exosomes was increased in treated cells (p < 0.05). Exosomes were confirmed by size and positive for CD63 marker. Molecular analysis of the exosomal secretory pathway has revealed a significant induction of CD63, CD81, TSAP6, Rab11, Rab27a, and Rab27b in response to H2O2 (p < 0.05). The distribution of CD63 was increased inside treated cells. The western blotting technique revealed a significant up-regulation in Becline-1 and P62 and a significant decrease in LC3 II/I ratio in treated cells (p < 0.05)s. Concomitant with an up-regulation of common molecules in exosomes biogenesis and autophagy including Atg5, P62 and P53, expression of miR-182 decreased and miR-155 increased in cells incubated with H2O2 (p < 0.05). Data suggested an induction in the exosomal secretory pathway coincided with a block in autophagy progress, accelerating senescence, which might be targeted for the treatment of age-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Locomotion is mediated by spinal circuits that generate movements with a precise coordination and vigor. The assembly of these circuits is defined early during development; however, whether their organization and function remain invariant throughout development is unclear. Here, we show that the first established fast circuit between two dorsally located V2a interneuron types and the four primary motoneurons undergoes major transformation in adult zebrafish compared with what was reported in larvae. There is a loss of existing connections and establishment of new connections combined with alterations in the mode, plasticity, and strength of synaptic transmission. In addition, we show that this circuit no longer serves as a swim rhythm generator, but instead its components become embedded within the spinal escape circuit and control propulsion following the initial escape turn. Our results thus reveal significant changes in the organization and function of a motor circuit as animals develop toward adulthood.

Abstract: The neuromuscular junction (NMJ), which is a synapse for signal transmission from motor neurons to muscle cells, has emerged as an important region because of its association with several peripheral neuropathies. In particular, mutations in GARS that affect the formation of NMJ result in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. These disorders are mainly considered to be caused by neuronal axon abnormalities; however, no treatment is currently available. Therefore, in order to determine whether the NMJ could be targeted to treat neurodegenerative disorders, we investigated the NMJ recovery effect of HDAC6 inhibitors, which have been used in the treatment of several peripheral neuropathies. In the present study, we demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibition was sufficient to enhance movement by restoring NMJ impairments observed in a zebrafish disease model. We found that CKD-504, a novel HDAC6 inhibitor, was effective in repairing NMJ defects, suggesting that treatment of neurodegenerative diseases via NMJ targeting is possible.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can reduce the risk of hospitalization from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) when administered early. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have negatively affected therapeutic use of some authorized mAbs. Using a high-throughput B cell screening pipeline, we isolated LY-CoV1404 (bebtelovimab), a highly potent SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody. LY-CoV1404 potently neutralizes authentic SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2. In pseudovirus neutralization studies, LY-CoV1404 potently neutralizes variants, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, B.1.427/B.1.429, P.1, B.1.526, B.1.1.529, and the BA.2 subvariant. Structural analysis reveals that the contact residues of the LY-CoV1404 epitope are highly conserved, except for N439 and N501. The binding and neutralizing activity of LY-CoV1404 is unaffected by the most common mutations at these positions (N439K and N501Y). The broad and potent neutralization activity and the relatively conserved epitope suggest that LY-CoV1404 has the potential to be an effective therapeutic agent to treat all known variants.

Abstract: Summary
Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have received emergency use approval for treatment of COVID-19. However, with the emergence of variants of concern, there is a need for new treatment options. We report a format that enables modular assembly of bi-paratopic tetravalent nAbs with antigen-binding sites from two distinct nAbs. The tetravalent nAb purifies in high yield and exhibits biophysical characteristics that are comparable to those of clinically used therapeutic antibodies. The tetravalent nAb binds to the spike protein trimer at least 100-fold more tightly than bivalent IgGs (apparent KD < 1 pM) and neutralizes a broad array of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, chimeric viruses, and authentic viral variants with high potency. Together, these results establish the tetravalent diabody-Fc-Fab as a robust, modular platform for rapid production of drug-grade nAbs with potencies and breadth of coverage that greatly exceed those of conventional bivalent IgGs.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental patterning networks are regulated by multiple inputs and feedback connections that rapidly reshape gene expression, limiting the information that can be gained solely from slow genetic perturbations. Here we show that fast optogenetic stimuli, real-time transcriptional reporters, and a simplified genetic background can be combined to reveal the kinetics of gene expression downstream of a developmental transcription factor in vivo. We engineer light-controlled versions of the Bicoid transcription factor and study their effects on downstream gap genes in embryos. Our results recapitulate known relationships, including rapid Bicoid-dependent transcription of giant and hunchback and delayed repression of Krüppel. In addition, we find that the posterior pattern of knirps exhibits a quick but inverted response to Bicoid perturbation, suggesting a noncanonical role for Bicoid in directly suppressing knirps transcription. Acute modulation of transcription factor concentration while recording output gene activity represents a powerful approach for studying developmental gene networks in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-infiltrating neoantigen-reactive T cells can mediate regression of metastatic gastrointestinal cancers yet remain poorly characterized. We performed immunological screening against personalized neoantigens in combination with single-cell RNA sequencing on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from bile duct and pancreatic cancer patients to characterize the transcriptomic landscape of neoantigen-reactive T cells. We found that most neoantigen-reactive CD8+ T cells displayed an exhausted state with significant CXCL13 and GZMA co-expression compared with non-neoantigen-reactive bystander cells. Most neoantigen-reactive CD4+ T cells from a patient with bile duct cancer also exhibited an exhausted phenotype but with overexpression of HOPX or ADGRG1 while lacking IL7R expression. Thus, neoantigen-reactive T cells infiltrating gastrointestinal cancers harbor distinct transcriptomic signatures, which may provide new opportunities for harnessing these cells for therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms that generate robust ionic oscillation in circadian pacemaker neurons are under investigation. Here, we demonstrate critical functions of the mitochondrial cation antiporter leucine zipper-EF-hand-containing transmembrane protein 1 (LETM1), which exchanges K+/H+ in Drosophila and Ca2+/H+ in mammals, in circadian pacemaker neurons. Letm1 knockdown in Drosophila pacemaker neurons reduced circadian cytosolic H+ rhythms and prolonged nuclear PERIOD/TIMELESS expression rhythms and locomotor activity rhythms. In rat pacemaker neurons in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), circadian rhythms in cytosolic Ca2+ and Bmal1 transcription were dampened by Letm1 knockdown. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake peaks late during the day were also observed in rat SCN neurons following photolytic elevation of cytosolic Ca2+. Since cation transport by LETM1 is coupled to mitochondrial energy synthesis, we propose that LETM1 integrates metabolic, ionic, and molecular clock rhythms in the central clock system in both invertebrates and vertebrates.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) maintains transcriptionally silent genes in a repressed state via deposition of histone H3K27-trimethyl (me3) marks. PRC2 has also been implicated in silencing transposable elements (TEs), yet how PRC2 is targeted to TEs remains unclear. To address this question, we identified proteins that physically interact with the Paramecium enhancer-of-zeste Ezl1 enzyme, which catalyzes H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 deposition at TEs. We show that the Paramecium PRC2 core complex comprises four subunits, each required in vivo for catalytic activity. We also identify PRC2 cofactors, including the RNA interference (RNAi) effector Ptiwi09, which are necessary to target H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 to TEs. We find that the physical interaction between PRC2 and the RNAi pathway is mediated by a RING finger protein and that small RNA recruitment of PRC2 to TEs is analogous to the small RNA recruitment of H3K9 methylation SU(VAR)3–9 enzymes.

Abstract: Summary
Synthesis of ribosomes begins in the nucleolus with formation of the 90S pre-ribosome, during which the pre-40S and pre-60S pathways diverge by pre-rRNA cleavage. However, it remains unclear how, after this uncoupling, the earliest pre-60S subunit continues to develop. Here, we reveal a large-subunit intermediate at the beginning of its construction when still linked to the 90S, the precursor to the 40S subunit. This primordial pre-60S is characterized by the SPOUT domain methyltransferase Upa1-Upa2, large α-solenoid scaffolds, Mak5, one of several RNA helicases, and two small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), C/D box snR190 and H/ACA box snR37. The emerging pre-60S does not efficiently disconnect from the 90S pre-ribosome in a dominant mak5 helicase mutant, allowing a 70-nm 90S-pre-60S bipartite particle to be visualized by electron microscopy. Our study provides insight into the assembly pathway when the still-connected nascent 40S and 60S subunits are beginning to separate.

Abstract: Summary
Pooled genetic libraries have improved screening throughput for mapping genotypes to phenotypes. However, selectable phenotypes are limited, restricting screening to outcomes with a low spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we integrated live-cell imaging with pooled library-based screening. To enable intracellular multiplexing, we developed a method called EPICode that uses a combination of short epitopes, which can also appear in various subcellular locations. EPICode thus enables the use of live-cell microscopy to characterize a phenotype of interest over time, including after sequential stimulatory/inhibitory manipulations, and directly connects behavior to the cellular genotype. To test EPICode’s capacity against an important milestone—engineering and optimizing dynamic, live-cell reporters—we developed a live-cell PKA kinase translocation reporter with improved sensitivity and specificity. The use of epitopes as fluorescent barcodes introduces a scalable strategy for high-throughput screening broadly applicable to protein engineering and drug discovery settings where image-based phenotyping is desired.

Abstract: Summary
X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is mediated by the non-coding RNA Xist, which directs chromatin modification and gene silencing in cis. The RNA binding protein SPEN and associated corepressors have a central role in Xist-mediated gene silencing. Other silencing factors, notably the Polycomb system, have been reported to function downstream of SPEN. In recent work, we found that SPEN has an additional role in correct localization of Xist RNA in cis, indicating that its contribution to chromatin-mediated gene silencing needs to be reappraised. Making use of a SPEN separation-of-function mutation, we show that SPEN and Polycomb pathways, in fact, function in parallel to establish gene silencing. We also find that differentiation-dependent recruitment of the chromosomal protein SmcHD1 is required for silencing many X-linked genes. Our results provide important insights into the mechanism of X inactivation and the coordination of chromatin-based gene regulation with cellular differentiation and development.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the success of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for cancer, resistance and relapse are frequent. Combination therapies are expected to enhance response rates and overcome this resistance. Herein, we report that combining PRMT7 inhibition with ICI therapy induces a strong anti-tumor T cell immunity and restrains tumor growth in vivo by increasing immune cell infiltration. PRMT7-deficient B16.F10 melanoma exhibits increased expression of genes in the interferon pathway, antigen presentation, and chemokine signaling. PRMT7 deficiency or inhibition with SGC3027 in B16.F10 melanoma results in reduced DNMT expression, loss of DNA methylation in the regulatory regions of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) causing their increased expression. PRMT7-deficient cells increase RIG-I and MDA5 expression with a reduction in the H4R3me2s repressive histone mark at their gene promoters. Our findings identify PRMT7 as a regulatory checkpoint for RIG-I, MDA5, and their ERV-double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ligands, facilitating immune escape and anti-tumor T cell immunity to restrain tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
RNA silencing is a conserved mechanism in eukaryotes involved in development and defense against viruses. In plants, ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) protein plays a central role in both microRNA- and small interfering RNA-directed silencing, and its expression is regulated at multiple levels. Here, we report that the F-box protein FBW2 assembles an SCF complex that selectively targets for proteolysis AGO1 when it is unloaded and mutated. Although FBW2 loss of function does not lead to strong growth or developmental defects, it significantly increases RNA-silencing activity. Interestingly, under conditions in which small-RNA accumulation is affected, the failure to degrade AGO1 in fbw2 mutants becomes more deleterious for the plant. Accordingly, the non-degradable AGO1 protein assembles high-molecular-weight complexes and binds illegitimate small RNA, leading to off-target cleavage. Therefore, control of AGO1 homeostasis by FBW2 plays an important role in quality control of RNA silencing.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular mRNA-binding proteins (mRBPs) are major posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Although many posttranslational modification sites in mRBPs have been identified, little is known about how these modifications regulate mRBP function. Here, we developed quantitative RNA-interactome capture (qRIC) to quantify the fraction of mRBPs pulled down with polyadenylated mRNAs. Combining qRIC with phosphoproteomics allowed us to systematically compare pull-down efficiencies of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of mRBPs. Almost 200 phosphorylation events affected pull-down efficiency compared with the unmodified mRBPs and thus have regulatory potential. Our data capture known regulatory phosphorylation sites in ELAVL1, SF3B1, and UPF1 and identify potential regulatory sites. Follow-up experiments on the splicing regulator RBM20 revealed multiple phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal disordered region affecting nucleocytoplasmic localization, association with cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules, and alternative splicing. Together, we show that qRIC in conjunction with phosphoproteomics is a scalable method to identify functional posttranslational modification sites in mRBPs.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are arthropod-borne pathogenic flaviviruses that co-circulate in many countries. To understand some of the pressures that influence ZIKV evolution, we mimic the natural transmission cycle by repeating serial passaging of ZIKV through cultured mosquito cells and either DENV-naive or DENV-immune mice. Compared with wild-type ZIKV, the strains passaged under both conditions exhibit increased pathogenesis in DENV-immune mice. Application of reverse genetics identifies an isoleucine-to-valine mutation (I39V) in the NS2B proteins of both passaged strains that confers enhanced fitness and escape from pre-existing DENV immunity. Introduction of I39V or I39T, a naturally occurring homologous mutation detected in recent ZIKV isolates, increases the replication of wild-type ZIKV in human neuronal precursor cells and laboratory-raised mosquitoes. Our data indicate that ZIKV strains with enhanced transmissibility and pathogenicity can emerge in DENV-naive or -immune settings, and that NS2B-I39 mutants may represent ZIKV variants of interest.

Abstract: Summary
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is essential for working memory (WM) and has primarily been viewed as being responsible for maintaining information over a delay, but it is unclear whether it also plays a more general role during WM. Using task phase-specific optogenetic silencing of pyramidal neurons in the medial PFC (mPFC) of mice performing a spatial WM task, we find that the mPFC is required not only during the delay phase of the task but also during other phases requiring the encoding and retrieval of spatial information. Imaging of mPFC pyramidal neurons reveals that they are most strongly influenced by the animals’ position and running direction, indicating a fundamental role in spatial navigation. Pyramidal neuron ensembles also represent to-be-remembered goal locations in a dynamic manner. Taken together, these results delineate the functional contribution of mPFC pyramidal neurons to WM, extending their role beyond the maintenance of information.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal morphologies provide the foundation for the electrical behavior of neurons, the connectomes they form, and the dynamical properties of the brain. Comprehensive neuron models are essential for defining cell types, discerning their functional roles, and investigating brain-disease-related dendritic alterations. However, a lack of understanding of the principles underlying neuron morphologies has hindered attempts to computationally synthesize morphologies for decades. We introduce a synthesis algorithm based on a topological descriptor of neurons, which enables the rapid digital reconstruction of entire brain regions from few reference cells. This topology-guided synthesis generates dendrites that are statistically similar to biological reconstructions in terms of morpho-electrical and connectivity properties and offers a significant opportunity to investigate the links between neuronal morphology and brain function across different spatiotemporal scales. Synthesized cortical networks based on structurally altered dendrites associated with diverse brain pathologies revealed principles linking branching properties to the structure of large-scale networks.

Abstract: Summary
Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) regulates mRNA alternative splicing of more than 90% of protein-coding genes, providing an essential source for biological versatility. This study finds that SRSF3 expression is associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. We also find that SRSF3 regulates ANRIL splicing and m6A modification of ANRIL in pancreatic cancer cells. More importantly, we demonstrate that m6A methylation on lncRNA ANRIL is essential for the splicing. Moreover, our results show that SRSF3 promotes gemcitabine resistance by regulating ANRIL’s splicing and ANRIL-208 (one of the ANRIL spliceosomes) can enhance DNA homologous recombination repair (HR) capacity by forming a complex with Ring1b and EZH2. In conclusion, this study establishes a link between SRSF3, m6A modification, lncRNA splicing, and DNA HR in pancreatic cancer and demonstrates that abnormal alternative splicing and m6A modification are closely related to chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Activated CD8+ T lymphocytes differentiate into heterogeneous subsets. Using super-resolution imaging, we found that prior to the first division, dynein-dependent vesicular transport polarized active TORC1 toward the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) at the proximal pole. This active TORC1 was physically associated with active eIF4F, required for the translation of c-myc mRNA. As a consequence, c-myc-translating polysomes polarized toward the cellular pole proximal to the immune synapse, resulting in localized c-myc translation. Upon division, the TORC1-eIF4A complex preferentially sorted to the proximal daughter cell, facilitating asymmetric c-Myc synthesis. Transient disruption of eIF4A activity at first division skewed long-term cell fate trajectories to memory-like function. Using a genetic barcoding approach, we found that first-division sister cells often displayed differences in transcriptional profiles that largely correlated with c-Myc and TORC1 target genes. Our findings provide mechanistic insights as to how distinct T cell fate trajectories can be established during the first division.

Abstract: Summary
The Btla inhibitory receptor limits innate and adaptive immune responses, both preventing the development of autoimmune disease and restraining anti-viral and anti-tumor responses. It remains unclear how the functions of Btla in diverse lymphocytes contribute to immunoregulation. Here, we show that Btla inhibits activation of genes regulating metabolism and cytokine signaling, including Il6 and Hif1a, indicating a regulatory role in humoral immunity. Within mucosal Peyer's patches, we find T-cell-expressed Btla-regulated Tfh cells, while Btla in T or B cells regulates GC B cell numbers. Treg-expressed Btla is required for cell-intrinsic Treg homeostasis that subsequently controls GC B cells. Loss of Btla in lymphocytes results in increased IgA bound to intestinal bacteria, correlating with altered microbial homeostasis and elevations in commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Together our studies provide important insights into how Btla functions as a checkpoint in diverse conventional and regulatory lymphocyte subsets to influence systemic immune responses.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA), also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, has a complex etiology, and its pathogenesis remains unclear. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy has been widely used in medicine and other related professions since its clinical application was first reported in the 1980 s and the 1990 s. This study aimed to investigate the effects and potential mechanisms of PRP in OA. An in vitro model of osteoarthritis was constructed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and the effect of PRP on LPS-induced chondrocytes was evaluated. The results indicated that although LPS inhibited chondrocyte proliferation and promoted inflammation and apoptosis, these effects were reversed by PRP. In addition, the LPS-suppressed expression of aggrecan, TGF-β, PDGF, and COL2A1 was restored by PRP, whereas the LPS-enhanced expression of MMP3 was suppressed by PRP. Furthermore, PRP inhibited LPS-induced mitochondrial damage by suppressing reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, Drp1 expression, and upregulating Mfn1 expression. In addition, PRP inhibited the phosphorylation of AMPK and NF-κB. Collectively, this study indicates that PRP might be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of OA by repairing mitochondrial function through the activation of AMPK/NF-κB signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have enabled simultaneous measurement of multiple cellular modalities, but the combined detection of histone post-translational modifications and transcription at single-cell resolution has remained limited. Here, we introduce EpiDamID, an experimental approach to target a diverse set of chromatin types by leveraging the binding specificities of single-chain variable fragment antibodies, engineered chromatin reader domains, and endogenous chromatin-binding proteins. Using these, we render the DamID technology compatible with the genome-wide identification of histone post-translational modifications. Importantly, this includes the possibility to jointly measure chromatin marks and transcription at the single-cell level. We use EpiDamID to profile single-cell Polycomb occupancy in mouse embryoid bodies and provide evidence for hierarchical gene regulatory networks. In addition, we map H3K9me3 in early zebrafish embryogenesis, and detect striking heterochromatic regions specific to notochord. Overall, EpiDamID is a new addition to a vast toolbox to study chromatin states during dynamic cellular processes.

Abstract: Summary
High-risk forms of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remain a therapeutic challenge. Leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) self-renew and spark relapse and therefore have been the subject of intensive investigation; however, the properties of LICs in high-risk B-ALL are not well understood. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics and quantitative xenotransplantation to understand LICs in MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) B-ALL. Compared with reported LIC frequencies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), engraftable LICs in MLL-r B-ALL are abundant. Although we find that multipotent, self-renewing LICs are enriched among phenotypically undifferentiated B-ALL cells, LICs with the capacity to replenish the leukemic cellular diversity can emerge from more mature fractions. While inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation blunts blast proliferation, this intervention promotes LIC emergence. Conversely, inhibiting hypoxia and glycolysis impairs MLL-r B-ALL LICs, providing a therapeutic benefit in xenotransplantation systems. These findings provide insight into the aggressive nature of MLL-r B-ALL and provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of hypoxia and glycolysis.

Abstract: Monocyte-derived multipotential cells (MOMCs) are a subpopulation of monocytes that appear to be capable of differentiating into many cell populations, thus MOMCs can be an ideal autologous transplantable cell source for regenerative medicine. In this study, we generated MOMCs from leukapheresis filters, evaluated their ability to differentiate to endothelium and osteocytes and performed their molecular characterization. For this purpose, leukapheresis filters were collected from a hospital blood donation department and used for leukocytes isolation. The isolated leukocytes were cultured in a medium supplemented with SDF-1a for MOMCs generation. We evaluated the expression of the multipotency genes ZNF217, ZNF878, ESRRB, SALL4, KLF4, SOX2, NANOG, OCT4, GAPDH, CD34 and c- MYC in MOMCs with real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and the differentiation capacity of MOMCs to osteocytes and endothelium with qRT-PCR. The results suggest that MOMCs can be generated using leukocytes isolated from leukapheresis filters in the presence of SDF-1a. Furthermore, MOMCs expressed all the tested factors responsible to activate the networks of pluripotency of cells and can differentiate into endothelium and osteocytes. Therefore, the blood donors could benefit and be rewarded with the potential use of their own immune system cells for future treatment in the frame of personalized regenerative medicine.

Abstract: A pathogenic role of serine/threonine protein kinase 25 (STK25) has been observed in several chronic liver diseases. However, whether STK25 participates in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unexplored. The current work aimed to explore the role and mechanism of STK25 in HCC. A high STK25 level was found in HCC tissue, which was associated with reduced overall survival. HCC cells with STK25 silencing displayed a marked decrease in proliferative and invasive ability, but were highly sensitive to apoptosis induced by the chemotherapy drug sorafenib. Reciprocally, HCC cells with forced expression of STK25 displayed the opposite effects. Further data unveiled that STK25 silencing restrained the activation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) associated with regulation of mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1/2 (MST1/2). Forced expression of constitutively active YAP1 abolished STK25 silencing-induced antitumor effects, while repression of YAP1 reversed STK25 upregulation-induced protumor effects. Additionally, HCC cells with STK25 silencing exhibited reduced tumorigenic potential in vivo. Collectively, the results show that STK25 exerts a protumor function in HCC by enhancing YAP1 activation via regulation of MST1/2. These findings propose STK25 as a viable target for the development of anti-HCC therapy.

Abstract: Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been proven to participate in the recovery of aortic aneurysm. CXCL12 promotes EPC recruitment and revascularization. Therefore, this study was dedicated to fathoming out whether EPCs regulated by CXCL12 can participate in the recovery of aneurysm. The morphology and maker protein activity of EPCs derived from bone marrow were separately detected by microscopic examination and immunofluorescence. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot were performed to detect the transfection efficiency of CXCL12. Lumen formation, viability, and migration were determined by lumen formation, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and wound-healing assays, respectively. The aneurysm tissues in rat model of artery aneurysm were used for histopathological observation by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, α-SMA was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the expressions of VEGF, IGF1, FGF, PDGF and matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 (MMP-2/9) were measured by RT-qPCR and western blot assays. As a result, some EPCs showed fusiform on day 6, while others showed a cord-like structure. On day 17, cells presented a paving stone-like pattern. The expressions of CD34, CD133 and VEGFR2 were positive. CXCL12 overexpression promoted lumen formation, viability and migration of EPCs, and further facilitated growth of smooth muscle-like cells in the aneurysm cavity and VEGF expression, while inhibiting MMP-2/9 expression in the aneurysm tissues in vivo. The present study suggested that CXCL12 overexpression strengthened the lumen formation, viability, and migration of EPCs, and CXCL12-primed EPCs had better effects on aneurysm recovery than unmodified EPCs did.

Abstract: The androgen receptor (AR) is an important therapeutic target for treating prostate cancer (PCa). Moreover, there is an increasing need for understanding the AR-independent progression of tumor cells such as neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). Menin, which is encoded by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), serves as a direct link between AR and the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex in PCa development by activating AR target genes through histone H3 lysine 4 methylation. Although menin is a critical component of AR signaling, its tumorigenic role in AR-independent PCa cells remains unknown. Here, we compared the role of menin in AR-positive and AR-negative PCa cells via RNAi-mediated or pharmacological inhibition of menin. We demonstrated that menin was involved in tumor cell growth and metastasis in PCa cells with low or deficient levels of AR. The inhibition of menin significantly diminished the growth of PCa cells and induced apoptosis, regardless of the presence of AR. Additionally, transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of many metastasis-associated genes was perturbed by menin inhibition in AR-negative DU145 cells. Furthermore, wound-healing assay results showed that menin promoted cell migration in AR-independent cellular contexts. Overall, these findings suggest a critical function of menin in tumorigenesis and provide a rationale for drug development against menin toward targeting high-risk metastatic PCa, especially those independent of AR.

Abstract: Summary
The actomyosin cortex regulates the localization and function of proteins at the plasma membrane. Here, we study how membrane binding, cortical movements, and diffusion determine membrane protein distribution. In Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, actomyosin flows transport PAR polarity proteins to establish the anterior-posterior axis. Oligomerization of a key scaffold protein, PAR-3, is required for polarization. PAR-3 oligomers are a heterogeneous population of many different sizes, and it remains unclear how oligomer size affects PAR-3 segregation. To address this question, we engineered PAR-3 to defined sizes. We report that PAR-3 trimers are necessary and sufficient for PAR-3 function during polarization and later embryo development. Quantitative analysis of PAR-3 diffusion shows that a threshold size of three subunits allows PAR-3 clusters to stably bind the membrane, where they are corralled and transported by the actomyosin cortex. Our study provides a quantitative model for size-dependent protein transportation of peripheral membrane proteins by cortical flow.

Abstract: Summary
Tuberization is an important developmental process in potatoes, but it is highly affected by environmental conditions. Temperature is a major environmental factor affecting tuberization, with high temperatures suppressing tuber development. However, the temporal aspects of thermo-responsive tuberization remain elusive. In this study, we show that FT homolog StSP6A is suppressed by temporally distinct regulatory pathways. Experiments using StSP6A-overexpressing plants show that post-transcriptional regulation plays a major role at the early stage, while transcriptional regulation is an important late-stage factor, suppressing StSP6A at high temperatures in leaves. Overexpression of StSP6A in leaves restores tuber formation but does not recover tuber yield at the late stage, possibly because of suppressed sugar transport at high temperatures. Transcriptome analyses lead to the identification of potential regulators that may be involved in thermo-responsive tuberization at different stages. Our work shows that potato has temporally distinct molecular mechanisms that finely control tuber development at high temperatures.

Abstract: Summary
In multicellular organisms, secreted ligands selectively activate, or “address,” specific target cell populations to control cell fate decision-making and other processes. Key cell-cell communication pathways use multiple promiscuously interacting ligands and receptors, provoking the question of how addressing specificity can emerge from molecular promiscuity. To investigate this issue, we developed a general mathematical modeling framework based on the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway architecture. We find that promiscuously interacting ligand-receptor systems allow a small number of ligands, acting in combinations, to address a larger number of individual cell types, defined by their receptor expression profiles. Promiscuous systems outperform seemingly more specific one-to-one signaling architectures in addressing capability. Combinatorial addressing extends to groups of cell types, is robust to receptor expression noise, grows more powerful with increases in the number of receptor variants, and is maximized by specific biochemical parameter relationships. Together, these results identify design principles governing cellular addressing by ligand combinations.

Abstract: Summary
Dectin-1 recognizes β-glucan in fungal cell walls, and activation of Dectin-1 in dendritic cells (DCs) influences immune responses against fungi. Although many studies have shown that DCs activated via Dectin-1 induce different subsets of T helper cells according to different cytokine milieus, the mechanisms underlying such differences remain unknown. By harnessing polymorphic Candida albicans and polystyrene beads of different sizes, we find that target size influences production of cytokines that control differentiation of T helper cell subsets. Hyphal C. albicans and large beads activate DCs but cannot be phagocytosed due to their sizes, which prolongs the duration of Dectin-1 signaling. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that expression of Il33 is significantly increased by larger targets, and increased IL-33 expression promotes TH9 responses. Expression of IL-33 is regulated by the Dectin-1-SYK-PLCγ-CARD9-ERK pathway. Altogether, our study demonstrates that size of fungi can be a determining factor in how DCs induce context-appropriate adaptive immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 8 (CHD8) gene are a frequent cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While its phenotypic spectrum often encompasses macrocephaly, implicating cortical abnormalities, how CHD8 haploinsufficiency affects neurodevelopmental is unclear. Here, employing human cerebral organoids, we find that CHD8 haploinsufficiency disrupted neurodevelopmental trajectories with an accelerated and delayed generation of, respectively, inhibitory and excitatory neurons that yields, at days 60 and 120, symmetrically opposite expansions in their proportions. This imbalance is consistent with an enlargement of cerebral organoids as an in vitro correlate of patients’ macrocephaly. Through an isogenic design of patient-specific mutations and mosaic organoids, we define genotype-phenotype relationships and uncover their cell-autonomous nature. Our results define cell-type-specific CHD8-dependent molecular defects related to an abnormal program of proliferation and alternative splicing. By identifying cell-type-specific effects of CHD8 mutations, our study uncovers reproducible developmental alterations that may be employed for neurodevelopmental disease modeling.

Abstract: Summary
Resistance to apoptosis due to caspase deregulation is considered one of the main hallmarks of cancer. However, the discovery of novel non-apoptotic caspase functions has revealed unknown intricacies about the interplay between these enzymes and tumor progression. To investigate this biological problem, we capitalized on a Drosophila tumor model with human relevance based on the simultaneous overactivation of the EGFR and the JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Our data indicate that widespread non-apoptotic activation of initiator caspases limits JNK signaling and facilitates cell fate commitment in these tumors, thus preventing the overgrowth and exacerbation of malignant features of transformed cells. Intriguingly, caspase activity also reduces the presence of macrophage-like cells with tumor-promoting properties in the tumor microenvironment. These findings assign tumor-suppressing activities to caspases independent of apoptosis, while providing molecular details to better understand the contribution of these enzymes to tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatokines, secretory proteins from the liver, mediate inter-organ communication to maintain a metabolic balance between food intake and energy expenditure. However, molecular mechanisms by which hepatokine levels are rapidly adjusted following stimuli are largely unknown. Here, we unravel how CNOT6L deadenylase switches off hepatokine expression after responding to stimuli (e.g., exercise and food) to orchestrate energy intake and expenditure. Mechanistically, CNOT6L inhibition stabilizes hepatic Gdf15 and Fgf21 mRNAs, increasing corresponding serum protein levels. The resulting upregulation of GDF15 stimulates the hindbrain to suppress appetite, while increased FGF21 affects the liver and adipose tissues to induce energy expenditure and lipid consumption. Despite the potential of hepatokines to treat metabolic disorders, their administration therapies have been challenging. Using small-molecule screening, we identified a CNOT6L inhibitor enhancing GDF15 and FGF21 hepatokine levels, which dramatically improves diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Our discovery, therefore, lays the foundation for an unprecedented strategy to treat metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Circadian genes such as Clock, Bmal1, Cryptochrome1/2, and Period1/2/3 constitute the precise circadian system. ClockΔ19 is a commonly used mouse model harboring a circadian clock gene mutation, which lacks the EXON-19-encoded 51 amino acids. Previous reports have shown that ClockΔ19 mice have severe metabolic abnormalities. Here, we report that the mitochondria of ClockΔ19 mice exhibit excessive fission and dysfunction. We also demonstrate that CLOCK binds to the RNA-binding protein PUF60 through its EXON 19. Further, we find that PUF60 directly maintains mitochondrial homeostasis through regulating Drp1 mRNA stability, while the association with CLOCK can competitively inhibit this function. In ClockΔ19 mice, CLOCKΔ19 releases PUF60, leading to enhanced Drp1 mRNA stability and persistent mitochondrial fission. Our results reveal a direct post-transcriptional role of CLOCK in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis via Drp1 mRNA stability and that the loss of EXON 19 of CLOCK in ClockΔ19 mice leads to severe mitochondrial homeostasis disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Gene activation by mammalian transcription factors (TFs) requires multivalent interactions of their low-complexity domains (LCDs), but how such interactions regulate transcription remains unclear. It has been proposed that extensive LCD-LCD interactions culminating in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of TFs is the dominant mechanism underlying transactivation. Here, we investigated how tuning the amount and localization of LCD-LCD interactions in vivo affects transcription of endogenous human genes. Quantitative single-cell and single-molecule imaging reveals that the oncogenic TF EWS::FLI1 requires a narrow optimum of LCD-LCD interactions to activate its target genes associated with GGAA microsatellites. Increasing LCD-LCD interactions toward putative LLPS represses transcription of these genes in patient-derived cells. Likewise, ectopically creating LCD-LCD interactions to sequester EWS::FLI1 into a well-documented LLPS compartment, the nucleolus, inhibits EWS::FLI1-driven transcription and oncogenic transformation. Our findings show how altering the balance of LCD-LCD interactions can influence transcriptional regulation and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting disease-causing TFs.

Abstract: Summary
Dermal fibroblasts lose stem cell potency after birth, which prevents regenerative healing. However, the underlying intracellular mechanisms are largely unknown. We uncover the postnatal maturation of papillary fibroblasts (PFs) driven by the extensive Twist2-mediated remodeling of chromatin accessibility. A loss of the regenerative ability of postnatal PFs occurs with decreased H3K27ac levels. Single-cell transcriptomics, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) reveal the postnatal maturation trajectory associated with the loss of the regenerative trajectory in PFs, which is characterized by a marked decrease in chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac modifications. Histone deacetylase inhibition delays spontaneous chromatin remodeling, thus maintaining the regenerative ability of postnatal PFs. Genomic analysis identifies Twist2 as a major regulator within chromatin regions with decreased accessibility during the postnatal period. When Twist2 is genetically deleted in dermal fibroblasts, the intracellular cascade of postnatal maturation is significantly delayed. Our findings reveal the comprehensive intracellular mechanisms underlying intrinsic postnatal changes in dermal fibroblasts.

Abstract: Growth control establishes organism size, requiring mechanisms to sense and adjust growth during development. Studies of single cells revealed that size homeostasis uses distinct control methods. In multicellular organisms, mechanisms that regulate single cell growth must integrate control across organs and tissues during development to generate adult size and shape. We leveraged the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a scalable and tractable model to collect precise growth measurements of thousands of individuals, measure feeding behavior, and quantify changes in animal size and shape during a densely sampled developmental time course. As animals transitioned from one developmental stage to the next, we observed changes in body aspect ratio while body volume remained constant. Then, we modeled a physical mechanism by which constraints on cuticle stretch could cause changes in C. elegans body shape. The model-predicted shape changes are consistent with those observed in the data. Theoretically, cuticle stretch could be sensed by the animal to initiate larval-stage transitions, providing a means for physical constraints to influence developmental timing and growth rate in C. elegans.

Abstract: Summary
Base pairing of the seed region (g2–g8) is essential for microRNA targeting; however, the in vivo function of the 3′ non-seed region (g9–g22) is less well understood. Here, we report a systematic investigation of the in vivo roles of 3′ non-seed nucleotides in microRNA let-7a, whose entire g9–g22 region is conserved among bilaterians. We find that the 3′ non-seed sequence functionally distinguishes let-7a from its family paralogs. The complete pairing of g11–g16 is essential for let-7a to fully repress multiple key targets, including evolutionarily conserved lin-41, daf-12, and hbl-1. Nucleotides at g17–g22 are less critical but may compensate for mismatches in the g11–g16 region. Interestingly, a certain minimal complementarity to let-7a 3′ non-seed sequence can be required even for sites with perfect seed pairing. These results provide evidence that the specific configurations of both seed and 3′ non-seed base pairing can critically influence microRNA-mediated gene regulation in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The androgen receptor (AR) is a nuclear receptor that governs gene expression programs required for prostate development and male phenotype maintenance. Advanced prostate cancers display AR hyperactivation and transcriptome expansion, in part, through AR amplification and interaction with oncoprotein cofactors. Despite its biological importance, how AR domains and cofactors cooperate to bind DNA has remained elusive. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we isolated three conformations of AR bound to DNA, showing that AR forms a non-obligate dimer, with the buried dimer interface utilized by ancestral steroid receptors repurposed to facilitate cooperative DNA binding. We identify novel allosteric surfaces which are compromised in androgen insensitivity syndrome and reinforced by AR’s oncoprotein cofactor, ERG, and by DNA-binding motifs. Finally, we present evidence that this plastic dimer interface may have been adopted for transactivation at the expense of DNA binding. Our work highlights how fine-tuning AR’s cooperative interactions translate to consequences in development and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the complexities of behavior is necessary to interpret neurophysiological data and establish animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. This understanding requires knowledge of the underlying information-processing structure—something often hidden from direct observation. Commonly, one assumes that behavior is solely governed by the experimenter-controlled rules that determine tasks. For example, differences in tasks that require memory of past actions are often interpreted as exclusively resulting from differences in memory. However, such assumptions are seldom tested. Here, we provide a comprehensive examination of multiple processes that contribute to behavior in a prevalent experimental paradigm. Using a combination of behavioral automation, hypothesis-driven trial design, and reinforcement learning modeling, we show that rats learn a spatial alternation task consistent with their drawing upon spatial preferences in addition to memory. Our approach also distinguishes learning based on established preferences from generalization of task structure, providing further insights into learning dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
During productive human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, viral genes are expressed in a coordinated cascade that conventionally relies on the dependencies of viral genes on protein synthesis and viral DNA replication. By contrast, the transcriptional landscape of HCMV latency is poorly understood. Here, we examine viral gene expression dynamics during the establishment of both productive and latent HCMV infections. We redefine HCMV gene expression kinetics during productive infection and reveal that viral gene regulation does not represent a simple sequential cascade; many viral genes are regulated by multiple independent modules. Using our improved gene expression classification combined with transcriptome-wide measurements of the effects of a wide array of epigenetic inhibitors on viral gene expression during latency, we show that a defining feature of latency is the unique repression of immediate-early (IE) genes. Altogether, we recharacterize HCMV gene expression kinetics and reveal governing principles of lytic and latent gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Phospholipase A2, group VII (PLA2G7) is widely recognized as a secreted, lipoprotein-associated PLA2 in plasma that converts phospholipid platelet-activating factor (PAF) to a biologically inactive product Lyso-PAF during inflammatory response. We report that intracellular PLA2G7 is selectively important for cell proliferation and tumor growth potential of melanoma cells expressing mutant NRAS, but not cells expressing BRAF V600E. Mechanistically, PLA2G7 signals through its product Lyso-PAF to contribute to RAF1 activation by mutant NRAS, which is bypassed by BRAF V600E. Intracellular Lyso-PAF promotes p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) activation by binding to its catalytic domain and altering ATP kinetics, while PAK2 significantly contributes to S338-phosphorylation of RAF1 in addition to PAK1. Furthermore, the PLA2G7-PAK2 axis is also required for full activation of RAF1 in cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or cancer cells expressing mutant KRAS. Thus, PLA2G7 and Lyso-PAF exhibit intracellular signaling functions as key elements of RAS-RAF1 signaling.

Abstract: The fat body originates from mesoderm during embryogenesis and it exists through the developmental stages in insects. It is equivalent to vertebrate adipose tissue and liver because it has multiple metabolic and storage functions. The fat body controls the synthesis, storage and metabolism of glycogen, lipid and protein, and it plays a major role in immune and endocrine systems and detoxification processes. Main cells of fat body, which accomplish these vital functions are trophocytes. In this study, we aimed to determine the reserve molecules like glycogen, lipid, protein and uric acid accumulated in the fat body at postembryonic developmental stages of Bombyx mori. For this purpose, we used specific histochemical techniques to determine glycogen, lipid, protein and uric acid molecules. We determined that glycogen contents are stored from the 3rd larval stage while proteins and uric acids are stored from the 4th larval stage. We also detected that the amount of glycogen, lipid, protein and uric acid increase gradually throughout the larval stage and then these molecules decrease gradually as they are used in the pupal stage. Fat body biology may require further investigations on the underlying function of the fat body formation throughout the developmental stages. It can also be used as a model in research of metabolic disorders and immune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Inner ear vestibular and spiral ganglion neurons (VGNs and SGNs) are known to play pivotal roles in balance control and sound detection. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying otic neurogenesis at early embryonic ages have remained unclear. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal the transcriptomes of mouse otic tissues at three embryonic ages, embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), E11.5, and E13.5, covering proliferating and undifferentiated otic neuroblasts and differentiating VGNs and SGNs. We validate the high quality of our studies by using multiple assays, including genetic fate mapping analysis, and we uncover several genes upregulated in neuroblasts or differentiating VGNs and SGNs, such as Shox2, Myt1, Casz1, and Sall3. Notably, our findings suggest a general cascaded differentiation trajectory during early otic neurogenesis. The comprehensive understanding of early otic neurogenesis provided by our study holds critical implications for both basic and translational research.

Abstract: Summary
Although vaccines and monoclonal antibody countermeasures have reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, variants with constellations of mutations in the spike gene jeopardize their efficacy. Accordingly, antiviral interventions that are resistant to further virus evolution are needed. The host-derived cytokine interferon lambda (IFN-λ) has been proposed as a possible treatment based on studies in human coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Here, we show that IFN-λ protects against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variants in three strains of conventional and human ACE2 transgenic mice. Prophylaxis or therapy with nasally delivered IFN-λ2 limits infection of historical or variant SARS-CoV-2 strains in the upper and lower respiratory tracts without causing excessive inflammation. In the lung, IFN-λ is produced preferentially in epithelial cells and acts on radio-resistant cells to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, inhaled IFN-λ may have promise as a treatment for evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants that develop resistance to antibody-based countermeasures.

Abstract: Summary
The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a complex brain region that is essential for reward function and frequently implicated in neuropsychiatric disease. While decades of research on VTA function have focused on dopamine neurons, recent evidence has identified critical roles for GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in reward processes. Additionally, although subsets of VTA neurons express genes involved in the synthesis and transport of multiple neurotransmitters, characterization of these combinatorial populations has largely relied on low-throughput methods. To comprehensively define the molecular architecture of the VTA, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on 21,600 cells from the rat VTA. Analysis of neuronal subclusters identifies selective markers for dopamine and combinatorial neurons, reveals expression profiles for receptors targeted by drugs of abuse, and demonstrates population-specific enrichment of gene sets linked to brain disorders. These results highlight the heterogeneity of the VTA and provide a resource for further exploration of VTA gene expression.

Abstract: Altered expression of transient receptor potential channel melastatin 4 (TRPM4) contributes to several diseases, including cardiac conduction disorders, immune diseases, and cancer. Yet the underlying mechanisms of TRPM4 expression changes remain elusive. In this study, we report that loss of tumor suppressor protein p53 or p63γ function or mutation of a putative p53 response element in the TRPM4 promoter region increase TRPM4 promoter activity in the colorectal cancer cell line HCT 116. In cells that lack p53 expression, we observed increased TRPM4 mRNA and protein levels and TRPM4-mediated Na+ currents. This phenotype can be reversed by transient overexpression of p53. In the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, which expresses p53 endogenously, p53 overexpression decreases TRPM4-mediated currents. As in other cancer cells, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of TRPM4 in p53 deficient HCT 116 cells results in increased store-operated Ca2+entry. The effect of the TRPM4 knockout is mimicked by p53 mediated suppression of TRPM4 in the parental cell line expressing TRPM4. In addition, a TRPM4 knockout-mediated shift in cell cycle is abolished upon loss of p53. Taken together, these findings indicate that p53 represses TRPM4 expression, thereby altering cellular Ca2+ signaling and that TRPM4 adds to cell cycle shift dependent on p53 signaling. One sentence summary: TRPM4 is repressed in the p53 pathway leading to reduced currents and increased calcium signaling.

Abstract: The purpose of this study aimed to figure out the role of GNA13 in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and the underlying mechanism. Male BALB/c mice were used to construct LUSC mouse model. Cell growth was examined using MTT and colony formation assay. Cell migration and invasion was determined using wound healing and transwell assay. The expression and phosphorylation of protein was detected by Western blotting assay. Immunohistochemistry staining was used to observe the tumor growth and metastasis. GNA13 was overexpressed in both LUSC tissues and LUSC cell lines. Knockdown of GNA13 in LUSC cells reduced cell viability and inhibited the formation of colonies in the SK-MES-1 and NCI-H520 cells. Cell migration and invasion was also prevented by inhibition of GNA13 in the LUSC cells. Phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT was downregulated by silencing GNA13 and upregulated by overexpression of GNA13 in the LUSC cells. In LUSC mouse model, tumor size and tumor weight were significantly decreased in si-GNA13 mice compared to control group. The expression of GNA13, Ki67, MMP2 and phosphorylation of AKT were significantly inhibited in si-GNA13 mice compared to control group. This study has demonstrated that knockdown of GNA13 could inhibit cell survival, migration and metastasis in LUSC.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon gamma (IFNγ) is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in autoimmune diseases. However, deficiency or neutralization of IFNγ is ineffective in reducing disease. We characterize islet antigen-specific T cells in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice lacking all three IFN receptor genes. Diabetes is minimally affected, but at 125 days of age, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, quantified using major histocompatibility complex class I tetramers, are present in 10-fold greater numbers in Ifngr-mutant NOD mice. T cells from Ifngr-mutant mice have increased proliferative responses to interleukin-2 (IL-2). They also have reduced phosphorylated STAT1 and its target gene, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1). IFNγ controls the expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells by mechanisms which include increased SOCS-1 expression that regulates IL-2 signaling. The expanded CD8+ T cells are likely to contribute to normal diabetes progression despite reduced inflammation in Ifngr-mutant mice.

Abstract: Summary
Malignant tumors exhibit altered metabolism resulting in a highly acidic extracellular microenvironment. Here, we show that cytoplasmic lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, indicative of a lipogenic phenotype, is a cellular adaption to extracellular acidity. LD marker PLIN2 is strongly associated with poor overall survival in breast cancer patients. Acid-induced LD accumulation is triggered by activation of the acid-sensing G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) OGR1, which is expressed highly in breast tumors. OGR1 depletion inhibits acid-induced lipid accumulation, while activation by a synthetic agonist triggers LD formation. Inhibition of OGR1 downstream signaling abrogates the lipogenic phenotype, which can be rescued with OGR1 ectopic expression. OGR1-depleted cells show growth inhibition under acidic growth conditions in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Isotope tracing shows that the source of lipid precursors is primarily autophagy-derived ketogenic amino acids. OGR1-depleted cells are defective in endoplasmic reticulum stress response and autophagy and hence fail to accumulate LDs affecting survival under acidic stress.

Abstract: Summary
Lung progenitor cells are crucial for regeneration following injury, yet it is unclear whether lung progenitor cells can be functionally engrafted after transplantation. We transplanted organoid cells derived from alveolar type II (AT2) cells enriched by SCA1-negative status (SNO) or multipotent SCA1-positive progenitor cells (SPO) into injured mouse lungs. Transplanted SNO cells are retained in the alveolar regions, whereas SPO cells incorporate into airway and alveolar regions. Single-cell transcriptomics demonstrate that transplanted SNO cells are comparable to native AT2 cells. Transplanted SPO cells exhibit transcriptional hallmarks of alveolar and airway cells, as well as transitional cell states identified in disease. Transplanted cells proliferate after re-injury of recipient mice and retain organoid-forming capacity. Thus, lung epithelial organoid cells exhibit progenitor cell functions after reintroduction to the lung. This study reveals methods to interrogate lung progenitor cell potential and model transitional cell states relevant to pathogenic features of lung disease in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) form the predominant microvasculature in the liver where they carry out many functions including the secretion of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). To investigate the early origins of this lineage, we develop an efficient and scalable protocol to produce human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived LSEC progenitors characterized as venous endothelial cells (VECs) from different mesoderm subpopulations. Using a sensitive and quantitative vascular competitive transplantation assay, we demonstrate that VECs generated from BMP4 and activin A-induced KDR+CD235a/b+ mesoderm are 50-fold more efficient at LSEC engraftment than venous cells from BMP4 and WNT-induced KDR+CD235a/b− mesoderm. When transplanted into immunocompromised hemophilia A mice (NSG-HA), these VECs engraft the liver, proliferate, and mature to functional LSECs that secrete bioactive FVIII capable of correcting the bleeding phenotype. Together, these findings highlight the importance of appropriate mesoderm induction for generating hPSC-derived LSECs capable of functioning in a preclinical model of hemophilia A.

Abstract: Summary
The lack of a consensus DNA sequence defining replication origins in mammals has led researchers to consider chromatin as a means to specify these regions. However, to date, there is no mechanistic understanding of how this could be achieved and maintained given that nucleosome disruption occurs with each fork passage and with transcription. Here, by genome-wide mapping of the de novo deposition of the histone variants H3.1 and H3.3 in human cells during S phase, we identified how their dual deposition mode ensures a stable marking with H3.3 flanked on both sides by H3.1. These H3.1/H3.3 boundaries correspond to the initiation zones of early origins. Loss of the H3.3 chaperone HIRA leads to the concomitant disruption of H3.1/H3.3 boundaries and initiation zones. We propose that the HIRA-dependent deposition of H3.3 preserves H3.1/H3.3 boundaries by protecting them from H3.1 invasion linked to fork progression, contributing to a chromatin-based definition of early replication zones.

Abstract: Summary
Natural immunity to malaria develops over time with repeated malaria episodes, but protection against severe malaria and immune regulation limiting immunopathology, called tolerance, develops more rapidly. Here, we comprehensively profile the blood immune system in patients, with or without prior malaria exposure, over 1 year after acute symptomatic Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Using a data-driven analysis approach to describe the immune landscape over time, we show that a dampened inflammatory response is associated with reduced γδ T cell expansion, early expansion of CD16+ monocytes, and parasite-specific antibodies of IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes. This also coincided with reduced parasitemia and duration of hospitalization. Our data indicate that antibody-mediated phagocytosis during the blood stage infection leads to lower parasitemia and less inflammatory response with reduced γδ T cell expansion. This enhanced control and reduced inflammation points to a potential mechanism on how tolerance is established following repeated malaria exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients suggests that inflammasomes, proinflammatory intracellular complexes, regulate various steps of infection. Lung epithelial cells express inflammasome-forming sensors and constitute the primary entry door of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe that the NLRP1 inflammasome detects SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. Specifically, human NLRP1 is cleaved at the Q333 site by multiple coronavirus 3CL proteases, which triggers inflammasome assembly and cell death and limits the production of infectious viral particles. Analysis of NLRP1-associated pathways unveils that 3CL proteases also inactivate the pyroptosis executioner Gasdermin D (GSDMD). Subsequently, caspase-3 and GSDME promote alternative cell pyroptosis. Finally, analysis of pyroptosis markers in plasma from COVID-19 patients with characterized severe pneumonia due to autoantibodies against, or inborn errors of, type I interferons (IFNs) highlights GSDME/caspase-3 as potential markers of disease severity. Overall, our findings identify NLRP1 as a sensor of SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelia.

Abstract: Summary
Organ formation requires integrating signals to coordinate proliferation, specify cell fates, and shape tissue. Tracing these events and signals remains a challenge, as intermediate states across many critical transitions are unresolvable over real time and space. Here, we designed a unique computational approach to decompose a non-linear differentiation process into key components to resolve the signals and cell behaviors that drive a rapid transition, using the hair follicle dermal condensate as a model. Combining scRNA sequencing with genetic perturbation, we reveal that proliferative Dkk1+ progenitors transiently amplify to become quiescent dermal condensate cells by the mere spatiotemporal patterning of Wnt/β-catenin and SHH signaling gradients. Together, they deterministically coordinate a rapid transition from proliferation to quiescence, cell fate specification, and morphogenesis. Moreover, genetically repatterning these gradients reproduces these events autonomously in “slow motion” across more intermediates that resolve the process. This analysis unravels two morphogen gradients that intersect to coordinate events of organogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 replicates in CD4+ T cells, leading to AIDS. Determining how HIV-1 shapes its niche to create a permissive environment is central to informing efforts to limit pathogenesis, disturb reservoirs, and achieve a cure. A key roadblock in understanding HIV-T cell interactions is the requirement to activate T cells in vitro to make them permissive to infection. This dramatically alters T cell biology and virus-host interactions. Here we show that HIV-1 cell-to-cell spread permits efficient, productive infection of resting memory T cells without prior activation. Strikingly, we find that HIV-1 infection primes resting T cells to gain characteristics of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM), including upregulating key surface markers and the transcription factor Blimp-1 and inducing a transcriptional program overlapping the core TRM transcriptional signature. This reprogramming is driven by Vpr and requires Vpr packaging into virions and manipulation of STAT5. Thus, HIV-1 reprograms resting T cells, with implications for viral replication and persistence.

Abstract: Summary
In the brain, oscillatory strength embedded in network rhythmicity is important for processing experiences, and this process is disrupted in certain psychiatric disorders. The use of rhythmic network stimuli can change these oscillations and has shown promise in terms of improving cognitive function, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we combine a two-layer learning model, with experiments involving genetically modified mice, that provides precise control of experience-driven oscillations by manipulating long-term potentiation of excitatory synapses onto inhibitory interneurons (LTPE→I). We find that, in the absence of LTPE→I, impaired network dynamics and memory are rescued by activating inhibitory neurons to augment the power in theta and gamma frequencies, which prevents network overexcitation with less inhibitory rebound. In contrast, increasing either theta or gamma power alone was less effective. Thus, inducing network changes at dual frequencies is involved in memory encoding, indicating a potentially feasible strategy for optimizing network-stimulating therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Animals must monitor continuous variables such as position or head direction. Manifold attractor networks—which enable a continuum of persistent neuronal states—provide a key framework to explain this monitoring ability. Neural networks with symmetric synaptic connectivity dominate this framework but are inconsistent with the diverse synaptic connectivity and neuronal representations observed in experiments. Here, we developed a theory for manifold attractors in trained neural networks, which approximates a continuum of persistent states, without assuming unrealistic symmetry. We exploit the theory to predict how asymmetries in the representation and heterogeneity in the connectivity affect the formation of the manifold via training, shape network response to stimulus, and govern mechanisms that possibly lead to destabilization of the manifold. Our work suggests that the functional properties of manifold attractors in the brain can be inferred from the overlooked asymmetries in connectivity and in the low-dimensional representation of the encoded variable.

Abstract: Summary
Differential interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling and production are associated with disparate effector and memory fates. Whether the IL-2 signals perceived by CD8 T cells come from autocrine or paracrine sources, the timing of IL-2 signaling and their differential impact on CD8 T cell responses remain unclear. Using distinct models of germline and conditional IL-2 ablation in post-thymic CD8 T cells, this study shows that paracrine IL-2 is sufficient to drive optimal primary expansion, effector and memory differentiation, and metabolic function. In contrast, autocrine IL-2 is uniquely required during primary expansion to program robust secondary expansion potential in memory-fated cells. This study further shows that IL-2 production by antigen-specific CD8 T cells is largely independent of CD4 licensing of dendritic cells (DCs) in inflammatory infections with robust DC activation. These findings bear implications for immunizations and adoptive T cell immunotherapies, where effector and memory functions may be commandeered through IL-2 programming.

Abstract: Summary
The Tibetan-Yi Corridor (TYC) region between Tibet and the rest of east Asia has served as a crossroads for human migrations for thousands of years. The lack of whole-genome sequencing data specific to the TYC populations has hindered the understanding of the fundamental patterns of migration and divergence between humans in east Asia and southeast Asia. Here, we provide 248 individual whole genomes from the 16 TYC and 3 outgroup populations to elucidate historical relationships. We find that the Tibetan plateau forms an important barrier to gene flow, with a more Tibetan-like ancestry in northern populations and a southern east Asian-related ancestry in south populations. An isolated population, Achang, shows a prolonged isolation and genetic drift compared to other TYC populations. We also note that previous claims regarding the history and structure of TYC populations inferred by linguistics are incompatible with the genetic evidence.

Abstract: Summary
The recently emerged B.1.1.529 (Omicron) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant has a highly divergent spike (S) glycoprotein. We compared the functional properties of B.1.1.529 BA.1 S with those of previous globally prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants, D614G and B.1.617.2. Relative to these variants, B.1.1.529 S exhibits decreases in processing, syncytium formation, virion incorporation, and ability to mediate infection of cells with high TMPRSS2 expression. B.1.1.529 and B.1.617.2 S glycoproteins bind ACE2 with higher affinity than D614G S. The unliganded B.1.1.529 S trimer is less stable at low temperatures than the other SARS-CoV-2 Ss, a property related to its more “open” S conformation. Upon ACE2 binding, the B.1.1.529 S trimer sheds S1 at 37°C, but not at 0°C. B.1.1.529 pseudoviruses are relatively resistant to neutralization by sera from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vaccinees. These properties of the B.1.1.529 S glycoprotein likely influence the transmission, cytopathic effects, and immune evasion of this emerging variant.

Abstract: Summary
The protein TRIM5α has multiple roles in antiretroviral defense, but the mechanisms underlying TRIM5α action are unclear. Here, we employ APEX2-based proteomics to identify TRIM5α-interacting partners. Our proteomics results connect TRIM5 to other proteins with actions in antiviral defense. Additionally, they link TRIM5 to mitophagy, an autophagy-based mode of mitochondrial quality control that is compromised in several human diseases. We find that TRIM5 is required for Parkin-dependent and -independent mitophagy pathways where TRIM5 recruits upstream autophagy regulators to damaged mitochondria. Expression of a TRIM5 mutant lacking ubiquitin ligase activity is unable to rescue mitophagy in TRIM5 knockout cells. Cells lacking TRIM5 show reduced mitochondrial function under basal conditions and are more susceptible to immune activation and death in response to mitochondrial damage than are wild-type cells. Taken together, our studies identify a homeostatic role for a protein previously recognized exclusively for its antiviral actions.

Abstract: Summary
α-synuclein, β-synuclein, and γ-synuclein are abundantly expressed proteins in the vertebrate nervous system. α-synuclein functions in neurotransmitter release by binding to and clustering synaptic vesicles and chaperoning SNARE-complex assembly. Pathologically, aggregates originating from soluble pools of α-synuclein are deposited into Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s disease and related synucleinopathies. The functions of β-synuclein and γ-synuclein in presynaptic terminals remain poorly studied. Using in vitro liposome binding studies, circular dichroism spectroscopy, immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments on isolated synaptic vesicles in combination with subcellular fractionation of brains from synuclein mouse models, we show that β-synuclein and γ-synuclein have a reduced affinity toward synaptic vesicles compared with α-synuclein, and that heteromerization of β-synuclein or γ-synuclein with α-synuclein results in reduced synaptic vesicle binding of α-synuclein in a concentration-dependent manner. Our data suggest that β-synuclein and γ-synuclein are modulators of synaptic vesicle binding of α-synuclein and thereby reduce α-synuclein’s physiological activity at the neuronal synapse.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of disease mutations is critical to advancing treatments. ALS-associated mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule motor KIF5A result in skipping of exon 27 (KIF5AΔExon27) and the encoding of a protein with a novel 39 amino acid residue C-terminal sequence. Here, we report that expression of ALS-linked mutant KIF5A results in dysregulated motor activity, cellular mislocalization, altered axonal transport, and decreased neuronal survival. Single-molecule analysis revealed that the altered C terminus of mutant KIF5A results in a constitutively active state. Furthermore, mutant KIF5A possesses altered protein and RNA interactions and its expression results in altered gene expression/splicing. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that causative ALS mutations result in a toxic gain of function in the intracellular motor KIF5A that disrupts intracellular trafficking and neuronal homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
RNA transfer via extracellular vesicles (EVs) influences cell phenotypes; however, lack of information regarding biogenesis of RNA-containing EVs has limited progress in the field. Here, we identify endoplasmic reticulum membrane contact sites (ER MCSs) as platforms for the generation of RNA-containing EVs. We identify a subpopulation of small EVs that is highly enriched in RNA and regulated by the ER MCS linker protein VAP-A. Functionally, VAP-A-regulated EVs are critical for miR-100 transfer between cells and in vivo tumor formation. Lipid analysis of VAP-A-knockdown EVs revealed reductions in the EV biogenesis lipid ceramide. Knockdown of the VAP-A-binding ceramide transfer protein CERT led to similar defects in EV RNA content. Imaging experiments revealed that VAP-A promotes luminal filling of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), CERT localizes to MVBs, and the ceramide-generating enzyme neutral sphingomyelinase 2 colocalizes with VAP-A-positive ER. We propose that ceramide transfer via VAP-A-CERT linkages drives the biogenesis of a select RNA-containing EV population.

Abstract: Summary
Up to 15% of human cancers maintain their telomeres through a telomerase-independent mechanism, termed “alternative lengthening of telomeres” (ALT) that relies on homologous recombination between telomeric sequences. Emerging evidence suggests that the recombinogenic nature of ALT telomeres results from the formation of RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) between telomeric DNA and the long-noncoding telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA). Here, we show that the mismatch repair protein MutSβ, a heterodimer of MSH2 and MSH3 subunits, is enriched at telomeres in ALT cancer cells, where it prevents the accumulation of telomeric G-quadruplex (G4) structures and R-loops. Cells depleted of MSH3 display increased incidence of R-loop-dependent telomere fragility and accumulation of telomeric C-circles. We also demonstrate that purified MutSβ recognizes and destabilizes G4 structures in vitro. These data suggest that MutSβ destabilizes G4 structures in ALT telomeres to regulate TERRA R-loops, which is a prerequisite for maintenance of telomere integrity during ALT.

Abstract: Summary
GLS1 orchestrates glutaminolysis and promotes cell proliferation when glutamine is abundant by regenerating TCA cycle intermediates and supporting redox homeostasis. CB-839, an inhibitor of GLS1, is currently under clinical investigation for a variety of cancer types. Here, we show that GLS1 facilitates apoptosis when glutamine is deprived. Mechanistically, the absence of exogenous glutamine sufficiently reduces glutamate levels to convert dimeric GLS1 to a self-assembled, extremely low-Km filamentous polymer. GLS1 filaments possess an enhanced catalytic activity, which further depletes intracellular glutamine. Functionally, filamentous GLS1-dependent glutamine scarcity leads to inadequate synthesis of asparagine and mitogenome-encoded proteins, resulting in ROS-induced apoptosis that can be rescued by asparagine supplementation. Physiologically, we observed GLS1 filaments in solid tumors and validated the tumor-suppressive role of constitutively active, filamentous GLS1 mutants K320A and S482C in xenograft models. Our results change our understanding of GLS1 in cancer metabolism and suggest the therapeutic potential of promoting GLS1 filament formation.

Abstract: Summary
Septin filaments assemble into high-order molecular structures that associate with membranes, acting as diffusion barriers and scaffold proteins crucial for many cellular processes. How septin filaments organize in such structures is still not understood. Here, we used fission yeast to explore septin filament organization during cell division and its cell cycle regulation. Live-imaging and polarization microscopy analysis uncovered that septin filaments are initially recruited as a diffuse meshwork surrounding the acto-myosin contractile ring (CR) in anaphase, which undergoes compaction into two rings when CR constriction is initiated. We found that the anillin-like protein Mid2 is necessary to promote this compaction step, possibly acting as a bundler for septin filaments. Moreover, Mid2-driven septin compaction requires inputs from the septation initiation network as well as CR constriction and the β(1,3)-glucan synthase Bgs1. This work highlights that anillin-mediated septin ring assembly is under strict cell cycle control.

Abstract: Summary
Aided by extensive spike protein mutation, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant overtook the previously dominant Delta variant. Spike conformation plays an essential role in SARS-CoV-2 evolution via changes in receptor-binding domain (RBD) and neutralizing antibody epitope presentation, affecting virus transmissibility and immune evasion. Here, we determine cryo-EM structures of the Omicron and Delta spikes to understand the conformational impacts of mutations in each. The Omicron spike structure revealed an unusually tightly packed RBD organization with long range impacts that were not observed in the Delta spike. Binding and crystallography revealed increased flexibility at the functionally critical fusion peptide site in the Omicron spike. These results reveal a highly evolved Omicron spike architecture with possible impacts on its high levels of immune evasion and transmissibility.

Abstract: Summary
During embryonic development, digits gradually emerge in a periodic pattern. Although genetic evidence indicates that digit formation results from a self-organizing process, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we find that convergent-extension tissue flows driven by active stresses underlie digit formation. These active stresses simultaneously shape cartilage condensations and lead to the emergence of a compressive stress region that promotes high activin/p-SMAD/SOX9 expression, thereby defining digit-organizing centers via a mechanical feedback. In Wnt5a mutants, such mechanical feedback is disrupted due to the loss of active stresses, organizing centers do not emerge, and digit formation is precluded. Thus, digit emergence does not result solely from molecular interactions, as was previously thought, but requires a mechanical feedback that ensures continuous coupling between phalanx specification and elongation. Our work, which links mechanical and molecular signals, provides a mechanistic context for the emergence of organizing centers that may underlie various developmental processes.
