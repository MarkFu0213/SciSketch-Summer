Abstract: Background
In-Vitro/Cellular evidence is the backbone and vital proof of concept during the development of novel therapeutics as well as drugs repurposing against COVID-19. Choosing an ideal in-vitro model is vital as the virus entry is through ACE2, CD147, and TMPRSS2 dependant and very specific. In this regard, this is the first systematic review addressing the importance of specific cell lines used as potential in-vitro models in the isolation, pathogenesis, and therapeutics for SARS−COV-2.
Methods
We searched 17 literature databases with appropriate keywords, and identified 1173 non-duplicate studies. In the present study, 71 articles are included after a careful, thorough screening of the titles and their abstracts for possible inclusion using predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria (PRISMA Guidelines).
Results
In the current study, we compiled cell culture-based studies for SARS-CoV-2 and found the best compatible In-Vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 (Vero, VeroE6, HEK293 as well as its variants, Huh-7, Calu-3 2B4, and Caco2). Among other essential cell lines used include LLC-MK2, MDCKII, BHK-21, HepG2, A549,T cell leukemia (MT-2), stems cells based cell line DYR0100for differentiation assays, and embryo-specific NIH3T3 cell line for vaccine production.
Conclusion
The Present study provides a detailed summary of all the drugs/compounds screened for drug repurposing and discovery purpose using the in-vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 along with isolation, pathogenesis and vaccine production. This study also suggests that after careful evaluation of all the cell line based studies, Kidney cells (VeroE6, HEK293 along with their clones), liver Huh-7cells, respiratory Calu-3 cells, and intestinal Caco-2 are the most widely used in-vitro models for SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells provide key adaptive immune responses in infection, cancer, and autoimmunity. However, transcriptional heterogeneity of human intestinal TRM cells remains undefined. Here, we investigate transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of human TRM cells through study of donor-derived TRM cells from intestinal transplant recipients. Single-cell transcriptional profiling identifies two transcriptional states of CD8+ TRM cells, delineated by ITGAE and ITGB2 expression. We define a transcriptional signature discriminating these populations, including differential expression of cytotoxicity- and residency-associated genes. Flow cytometry of recipient-derived cells infiltrating the graft, and lymphocytes from healthy gut, confirm these CD8+ TRM phenotypes. CD8+ CD69+CD103+ TRM cells produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) and demonstrate greater polyfunctional cytokine production, whereas β2-integrin+CD69+CD103− TRM cells have higher granzyme expression. Analysis of intestinal CD4+ T cells identifies several parallels, including a β2-integrin+ population. Together, these results describe the transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional heterogeneity of human intestinal CD4+ and CD8+ TRM cells.

Abstract: Summary
A full understanding of the contribution of small RNAs (sRNAs) to bacterial virulence demands knowledge of their target suites under infection-relevant conditions. Here, we take an integrative approach to capturing targets of the Hfq-associated sRNA PinT, a known post-transcriptional timer of the two major virulence programs of Salmonella enterica. Using MS2 affinity purification and RNA sequencing (MAPS), we identify PinT ligands in bacteria under in vitro conditions mimicking specific stages of the infection cycle and in bacteria growing inside macrophages. This reveals PinT-mediated translational inhibition of the secreted effector kinase SteC, which had gone unnoticed in previous target searches. Using genetic, biochemical, and microscopic assays, we provide evidence for PinT-mediated repression of steC mRNA, eventually delaying actin rearrangements in infected host cells. Our findings support the role of PinT as a central post-transcriptional regulator in Salmonella virulence and illustrate the need for complementary methods to reveal the full target suites of sRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal loss can considerably diminish neural circuit function, impairing normal behavior by disrupting information flow in the circuit. Here, we use genetically engineered electrical synapses to reroute the flow of information in a C. elegans damaged chemosensory circuit in order to restore organism behavior. We impaired chemotaxis by removing one pair of interneurons from the circuit then artificially coupled two other adjacent neuron pairs by ectopically expressing the gap junction protein, connexin, in them. This restored chemotaxis in the animals. We expected to observe linear and direct information flow between the connexin-coupled neurons in the recovered circuit but also revealed the formation of new potent left-right lateral electrical connections within the connexin-expressing neuron pairs. Our analysis suggests that these additional electrical synapses help restore circuit function by amplifying weakened neuronal signals in the damaged circuit in addition to emulating the wild-type circuit. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Abstract: Summary
Bacillus subtilis structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes are topologically loaded at centromeric sites adjacent to the replication origin by the partitioning protein ParB. These ring-shaped ATPases then translocate down the left and right chromosome arms while tethering them together. Here, we show that the site-specific recombinase XerD, which resolves chromosome dimers, is required to unload SMC tethers when they reach the terminus. We identify XerD-specific binding sites in the terminus region and show that they dictate the site of unloading in a manner that depends on XerD but not its catalytic residue, its partner protein XerC, or the recombination site dif. Finally, we provide evidence that ParB and XerD homologs perform similar functions in Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, two broadly conserved factors that act at the origin and terminus have second functions in loading and unloading SMC complexes that travel between them.

Abstract: The adult neocortex is not hard-wired but instead retains the capacity to reorganise across multiple spatial scales long into adulthood. Plastic reorganisation occurs at the level of mesoscopic sensory maps, functional neuronal assemblies and synaptic ensembles and is thought to be a critical feature of neuronal network function. Here, we describe a series of approaches that use calcium imaging to measure network reorganisation across multiple spatial scales in vivo. At the mesoscopic level, we demonstrate that sensory activity can be measured in animals undergoing longitudinal behavioural assessment involving automated touchscreen tasks. At the cellular level, we show that network dynamics can be longitudinally measured at both stable and transient functional assemblies. At the level of single synapses, we show that functional subcellular calcium imaging approaches can be used to measure synaptic ensembles of dendritic spines in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that all three levels of imaging can be spatially related to local pathology in a preclinical rodent model of amyloidosis. We propose that multi-scale in vivo calcium imaging can be used to measure parallel plasticity processes operating across multiple spatial scales in both the healthy brain and preclinical models of disease.

Abstract: Summary
Rab1A is a small GTPase known for its role in vesicular trafficking. Recent evidence indicates that Rab1A is essential for amino acids (aas) sensing and signaling to regulate mTORC1 in normal and cancer cells. However, Rab1A’s in vivo function in mammals is not known. Here, we report the generation of tamoxifen (TAM)-induced whole body Rab1A knockout (Rab1A−/−) in adult mice. Rab1A−/− mice are viable but become hyperglycemic and glucose intolerant due to impaired insulin transcription and β-cell proliferation and maintenance. Mechanistically, Rab1A mediates AA-mTORC1 signaling, particularly branched chain amino acids (BCAA), to regulate the stability and localization of the insulin transcription factor Pdx1. Collectively, these results reveal a physiological role of aa-Rab1A-mTORC1 signaling in the control of whole-body glucose homeostasis in mammals. Intriguingly, Rab1A expression is reduced in β-cells of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, which is correlated with loss of insulin expression, suggesting that Rab1A downregulation contributes to T2D progression.

Abstract: Summary
There is a strong relationship between metabolic state and susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection, with energy metabolism setting the basis for an exaggerated immuno-inflammatory response, which concurs with MTB pathogenesis. Herein, we show that controlled caloric restriction (CR), not leading to malnutrition, protects susceptible DBA/2 mice against pulmonary MTB infection by reducing bacterial load, lung immunopathology, and generation of foam cells, an MTB reservoir in lung granulomas. Mechanistically, CR induced a metabolic shift toward glycolysis, and decreased both fatty acid oxidation and mTOR activity associated with induction of autophagy in immune cells. An integrated multi-omics approach revealed a specific CR-induced metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic signature leading to reduced lung damage and protective remodeling of lung interstitial tightness able to limit MTB spreading. Our data propose CR as a feasible immunometabolic manipulation to control MTB infection, and this approach offers an unexpected strategy to boost immunity against MTB.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) bind regulatory DNA to control gene expression, and mutations to either TFs or DNA can alter binding affinities to rewire regulatory networks and drive phenotypic variation. While studies have profiled energetic effects of DNA mutations extensively, we lack similar information for TF variants. Here, we present STAMMP (simultaneous transcription factor affinity measurements via microfluidic protein arrays), a high-throughput microfluidic platform enabling quantitative characterization of hundreds of TF variants simultaneously. Measured affinities for ∼210 mutants of a model yeast TF (Pho4) interacting with 9 oligonucleotides (>1,800 Kds) reveal that many combinations of mutations to poorly conserved TF residues and nucleotides flanking the core binding site alter but preserve physiological binding, providing a mechanism by which combinations of mutations in cis and trans could modulate TF binding to tune occupancies during evolution. Moreover, biochemical double-mutant cycles across the TF-DNA interface reveal molecular mechanisms driving recognition, linking sequence to function. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Abstract: Summary
Axonal degeneration is responsible for disease progression and accumulation of disability in many neurodegenerative conditions. The axonal degenerative process can generate a metastable pool of damaged axons that remain structurally and functionally viable but fated to degenerate in the absence of external intervention. SARM1, an NADase that depletes axonal energy stores upon activation, is the central driver of an evolutionarily conserved program of axonal degeneration. We identify a potent and selective small molecule isoquinoline inhibitor of SARM1 NADase that recapitulates the SARM1−/− phenotype and protects axons from degeneration induced by axotomy or mitochondrial dysfunction. SARM1 inhibition post-mitochondrial injury with rotenone allows recovery and rescues axons that already entered the metastable state. We conclude that SARM1 inhibition with small molecules has the potential to treat axonopathies of the central and peripheral nervous systems by preventing axonal degeneration and by allowing functional recovery of a metastable pool of damaged, but viable, axons.

Abstract: Summary
Diurnal regulation of whole-body lipid metabolism plays a vital role in metabolic health. Although changes in lipid levels across the diurnal cycle have been investigated, the system-wide molecular responses to both short-acting fasting-feeding transitions and longer-timescale circadian rhythms have not been explored in parallel. Here, we perform time-series multi-omics analyses of liver and plasma revealing that the majority of molecular oscillations are entrained by adaptations to fasting, food intake, and the postprandial state. By developing algorithms for lipid structure enrichment analysis and lipid molecular crosstalk between tissues, we find that the hepatic phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methylation pathway is diurnally regulated, giving rise to two pools of oscillating phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecules in the circulation, which are coupled to secretion of either very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Our work demonstrates that lipid molecular timeline profiling across tissues is key to disentangling complex metabolic processes and provides a critical resource for the study of whole-body lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
In the mammalian cerebral cortex, the developmental events governing allocation of different classes of inhibitory interneurons (INs) to distinct cortical layers are poorly understood. Here we report that the guidance receptor PlexinA4 (PLXNA4) is upregulated in serotonin receptor 3a-expressing (HTR3A+) cortical INs (hINs) as they invade the cortical plate, and that it regulates their laminar allocation to superficial cortical layers. We find that the PLXNA4 ligand Semaphorin3A (SEMA3A) acts as a chemorepulsive factor on hINs migrating into the nascent cortex and demonstrate that SEMA3A specifically controls their laminar positioning through PLXNA4. We identify deep-layer INs as a major source of SEMA3A in the developing cortex and demonstrate that targeted genetic deletion of Sema3a in these INs specifically affects laminar allocation of hINs. These data show that, in the neocortex, deep-layer INs control laminar allocation of hINs into superficial layers.

Abstract: Summary
SETDB1 is a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase critical for germline development. However, its function in early meiotic prophase I remains unknown. Here, we report that Setdb1 null spermatocytes display aberrant centromere clustering during leptotene, bouquet formation during zygotene, and subsequent failure in pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, as well as compromised meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin, which leads to meiotic arrest before pachytene and apoptosis of spermatocytes. H3K9me3 is enriched in centromeric or pericentromeric regions and is present in many sites throughout the genome, with a subset changed in the Setdb1 mutant. These observations indicate that SETDB1-mediated H3K9me3 is essential for the bivalent formation in early meiosis. Transcriptome analysis reveals the function of SETDB1 in repressing transposons and transposon-proximal genes and in regulating meiotic and somatic lineage genes. These findings highlight a mechanism in which SETDB1-mediated H3K9me3 during early meiosis ensures the formation of homologous bivalents and survival of spermatocytes.

Abstract: Summary
The cell-cycle phase is a major determinant of repair pathway choice at DNA double strand breaks, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), or homologous recombination (HR). Chk1 responds to genotoxic stress in S/G2 phase, but here, we report a role of Chk1 in directly promoting NHEJ repair in G1 phase. ASF1A is a histone chaperone, but it promotes NHEJ through a pathway independent of its histone-chaperone activity. Chk1 activated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase on DNA breaks in G1 promotes NHEJ through direct phosphorylation of ASF1A at Ser-166. ASF1A phosphorylated at Ser-166 interacts with the repair protein MDC1 and thus enhances MDC1’s interaction with ATM and the stable localization of ATM at DNA breaks. Chk1 deficiency suppresses all steps downstream of MDC1 following a DNA break in G1, namely histone ubiquitination, 53BP1 localization to the DNA break, and NHEJ. Thus, ASF1A phosphorylation by Chk1 is essential for DNA break repair by NHEJ in G1.

Abstract: Summary
Anterior segment dysgenesis is often associated with cornea diseases, cataracts, and glaucoma. In the anterior segment, the ciliary body (CB) containing inner and outer ciliary epithelia (ICE and OCE) secretes aqueous humor that maintains intraocular pressure (IOP). However, CB development and function remain poorly understood. Here, this study shows that NOTCH signaling in the CB maintains the vitreous, IOP, and eye structures by regulating CB morphogenesis, aqueous humor secretion, and vitreous protein expression. Notch2 and Notch3 function via RBPJ in the CB to control ICE-OCE adhesion, CB morphogenesis, aqueous humor secretion, and protein expression, thus maintaining IOP and eye structures. Mechanistically, NOTCH signaling transcriptionally controls Nectin1 expression in the OCE to promote cell adhesion for driving CB morphogenesis and to directly stabilize Cx43 for controlling aqueous humor secretion. Finally, NOTCH signaling directly controls vitreous protein secretion in the ICE. Therefore, this study provides important insight into CB functions and involvement in eye diseases.

Abstract: Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. It has been shown that exogenous glutamine (GLN) can inhibit the growth of tumor in vivo, but the relationship between GLN and gastric cancer has not been studied. The gastric cancer bearing mouse model was constructed and taken GLN orally at the same time, and the results found that oral GLN (1 or 2 g/kg/d) significantly inhibited the growth rate of tumor and reduce the weight of tumor tissues. Immunohistochemistry showed that oral GLN significantly reduced the PCNA index, which further proved that GLN could inhibit the growth of tumor cells. At the same time, TUNEL assay showed that oral GLN significantly enhanced the apoptosis levels of tumor cells. In addition, GLN reduced GSH levels in tumor tissues, but increased the levels of GSH in plasma, improved the T-lymphocyte transformation rate and NK cell activity, significantly inhibited the secretion of TNF-α and promoted the secretion of IL-2, thus regulating the immune function in vivo. Further detection of apoptosis pathway showed that oral GLN significantly enhanced the expression of pro-apoptotic factor Bad and inhibited the expression of Bcl-2. Meanwhile, GLN significantly increased the activities of Caspase-3, Caspase-8, caspase-9 and PARP. GSH activator NAC had a similar effect to GLN, which could improve the immune function and activate apoptosis pathway, while GSH inhibitor BSO significantly blocked the regulation of GLN, destroyed the immune balance and inhibited apoptosis, but IL-2 significantly blocked the anti-apoptotic effect of BSO. Therefore, oral GLN can improve immune function and activate apoptosis pathway through GSH, and then inhibit the growth of tumor in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Antibody-antigen binding relies on the specific interaction of amino acids at the paratope-epitope interface. The predictability of antibody-antigen binding is a prerequisite for de novo antibody and (neo-)epitope design. A fundamental premise for the predictability of antibody-antigen binding is the existence of paratope-epitope interaction motifs that are universally shared among antibody-antigen structures. In a dataset of non-redundant antibody-antigen structures, we identify structural interaction motifs, which together compose a commonly shared structure-based vocabulary of paratope-epitope interactions. We show that this vocabulary enables the machine learnability of antibody-antigen binding on the paratope-epitope level using generative machine learning. The vocabulary (1) is compact, less than 104 motifs; (2) distinct from non-immune protein-protein interactions; and (3) mediates specific oligo- and polyreactive interactions between paratope-epitope pairs.

Abstract: Summary
Stromal desmoplastic reaction in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) involves significant accumulation of type I collagen (Col1). However, the precise molecular and mechanistic contribution of Col1 in PDAC progression remains unknown. Activated pancreatic stellate cells/αSMA+ myofibroblasts are major contributors of Col1 in the PDAC stroma. We use a dual-recombinase genetic mouse model of spontaneous PDAC to delete Col1 specifically in myofibroblasts. This results in significant reduction of total stromal Col1 content and accelerates the emergence of PanINs and PDAC, decreasing overall survival. Col1 deletion leads to Cxcl5 upregulation in cancer cells via SOX9. Increase in Cxcl5 is associated with recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and suppression of CD8+ T cells, which can be attenuated with combined targeting of CXCR2 and CCR2 to restrain accelerated PDAC progression in the setting of stromal Col1 deletion. Our results unravel the fundamental role of myofibroblast-derived Co1l in regulating tumor immunity and restraining PDAC progression.

Abstract: Summary
Arabidopsis GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 (GSK3)-like kinases play various roles in plant development, including chloroplast development, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not well defined. Here, we demonstrate that transcription factors GLK1 and GLK2 interact with and are phosphorylated by the BRASSINOSTEROID insensitive2 (BIN2). The loss-of-function mutant of BIN2 and its homologs, bin2-3 bil1 bil2, displays abnormal chloroplast development, whereas the gain-of-function mutant, bin2-1, exhibits insensitivity to BR-induced de-greening and reduced numbers of thylakoids per granum, suggesting that BIN2 positively regulates chloroplast development. Furthermore, BIN2 phosphorylates GLK1 at T175, T238, T248, and T256, and mutations of these phosphorylation sites alter GLK1 protein stability and DNA binding and impair plant responses to BRs/darkness. On the other hand, BRs and darkness repress the BIN2-GLK module to enhance BR/dark-mediated de-greening and impair the formation of the photosynthetic apparatus. Our results thus provide a mechanism by which BRs modulate photomorphogenesis and chloroplast development.

Abstract: Summary
Many genes are regulated by multiple enhancers that often simultaneously activate their target gene. However, how individual enhancers collaborate to activate transcription is not well understood. Here, we dissect the functions and interdependencies of five enhancer elements that together activate Fgf5 expression during exit from naive murine pluripotency. Four intergenic elements form a super-enhancer, and most of the elements contribute to Fgf5 induction at distinct time points. A fifth, poised enhancer located in the first intron contributes to Fgf5 expression at every time point by amplifying overall Fgf5 expression levels. Despite low individual enhancer activity, together these elements strongly induce Fgf5 expression in a super-additive fashion that involves strong accumulation of RNA polymerase II at the intronic enhancer. Finally, we observe a strong anti-correlation between RNA polymerase II levels at enhancers and their distance to the closest promoter, and we identify candidate elements with properties similar to the intronic enhancer.

Abstract: Summary
In multicellular eukaryotes, RNA polymerase (Pol) II pauses transcription ~30–50 bp after initiation. While the budding yeast Saccharomyces has its transcription mechanisms mostly conserved with other eukaryotes, it appears to lack this fundamental promoter-proximal pausing. However, we now report that nearly all yeast genes, including constitutive and inducible genes, manifest two distinct transcriptional stall sites that are brought on by acute environmental signaling (e.g., peroxide stress). Pol II first stalls at the pre-initiation stage before promoter clearance, but after DNA melting and factor acquisition, and may involve inhibited dephosphorylation. The second stall occurs at the +2 nucleosome. It acquires most, but not all, elongation factor interactions. Its regulation may include Bur1/Spt4/5. Our results suggest that a double Pol II stall is a mechanism to downregulate essentially all genes in concert.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular processes are largely carried out by macromolecular assemblies, most of which are dynamic, having components that are in constant flux. One such assembly is the nuclear pore complex (NPC), an ∼50 MDa assembly comprised of ∼30 different proteins called Nups that mediates selective macromolecular transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm. We developed a proteomics method to provide a comprehensive picture of the yeast NPC component dynamics. We discovered that, although all Nups display uniformly slow turnover, their exchange rates vary considerably. Surprisingly, this exchange rate was relatively unrelated to each Nup’s position, accessibility, or role in transport but correlated with its structural role; scaffold-forming Nups exchange slowly, whereas flexible connector Nups threading throughout the NPC architecture exchange more rapidly. Targeted perturbations in the NPC structure revealed a dynamic resilience to damage. Our approach opens a new window into macromolecular assembly dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Magnesium (Mg2+) homeostasis depends on active transcellular Mg2+ reuptake from urine in distal convoluted tubules (DCTs) via the Mg2+ channel TRPM6, whose activity has been proposed to be regulated by EGF. Calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis depends on paracellular reabsorption in the thick ascending limbs of Henle (TALs). KCTD1 promotes terminal differentiation of TALs/DCTs, but how its deficiency affects urinary Mg2+ and Ca2+ reabsorption is unknown. Here, this study shows that DCT1-specific KCTD1 inactivation leads to hypomagnesemia despite normal TRPM6 levels because of reduced levels of the sodium chloride co-transporter NCC, whereas Mg2+ homeostasis does not depend on EGF. Moreover, KCTD1 deficiency impairs paracellular urinary Ca2+ and Mg2+ reabsorption in TALs because of reduced NKCC2/claudin-16/-19 and increased claudin-14 expression, leading to hypocalcemia and consequently to secondary hyperparathyroidism and progressive metabolic bone disease. Thus, KCTD1 regulates urinary reabsorption of Mg2+ and Ca2+ by inducing expression of NCC in DCTs and NKCC2/claudin-16/-19 in TALs.

Abstract: Summary
Caspase-4 is an intracellular sensor for cytosolic bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and underlies infection-elicited pyroptosis. It is unclear whether and how caspase-4 detects host-derived factors to trigger pyroptosis. Here we show that mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) activates caspase-4 by promoting the assembly of a protein complex, which we term the Apaf-1 pyroptosome, for the execution of facilitated pyroptosis. MPT, when induced by bile acids, calcium overload, or an adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) activator, triggers assembly of the pyroptosome comprised of Apaf-1 and caspase-4 with a stoichiometry ratio of 7:2. Unlike the direct cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) by caspase-4 upon LPS ligation, caspase-4 activated in the Apaf-1 pyroptosome proceeds to cleave caspase-3 and thereby GSDME to induce pyroptosis. Caspase-4-initiated and GSDME-executed pyroptosis underlies cholestatic liver failure. These findings identify Apaf-1 pyroptosome as a pivotal machinery for cells sensing MPT signals and may shed light on understanding how cells execute intrinsic pyroptosis under sterile conditions.

Abstract: Background
Hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (HILPDA) is considered to have tumorigenic activity, but its function in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is rarely known. This work aimed to assess the regulatory functions as well as the in-depth mechanism of HILPDA in LUAD.
Methods
The expression of HILPDA in LUAD tissues was analyzed based on TCGA database, and then qRT-PCR was performed to confirm the HILPDA expression in LUAD cell lines. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to measure the correlation of HILPDA expression and overall survival in patients with LUAD. Then, Cell-Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation and transwell assays were performed to detect cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Moreover, the pathways closely related to the high HILPDA expression was analyzed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. The levels of Cell cycle pathway-related proteins were assessed using western blotting.
Results
Herein, we revealed that HILPDA was expressed at high levels in LUAD tissues and cell lines, and LUAD patients with the higher HILPDA expression presented the shorter survival time. Down-regulation of HILPDA in Calu-3 cells can retard cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as arrest cells in the G1 phase, whereas overexpression of HILPDA in A549 cells presented a marked promotion on these phenotypes. Moreover, we surveyed that knockdown of HILPDA restrained the activation of cell cycle pathway, while up-regulation of HILPDA led to opponent outcomes.
Conclusions
In summing, HILPDA may act as an oncogenic factor in LUAD cells via modulating cell cycle pathway, which represent a novel biomarker of tumorigenesis in LUAD patients.

Abstract: To elucidate the role of sialomucin in friction reduction, we investigated the sliding friction of pleural mesothelial cells monolayers cultured on fibrine gel. These measurements were performed on normal (4/4 RM-4) and on tumor (CARM-L1 TG3) cell lines. The effect of treatment with neuraminidase, which removes sialic acid from sialomucin, and of dexamethasone, which has shown to increase sialomucin expression, were also assessed. Furthermore, the expression of the main form of cell-surface-associated mucin (MUC1) present in the mesothelium, was assessed by western blot and immunofluorescence, under different experimental conditions. Expression of MUC1 was not significantly different in the two cell lines. Moreover, dexamethasone did not increase the expression of MUC1. Coefficient of kinetic friction (μ) was significantly higher in tumor cells than in normal cells. Neuraminidase increased μ in both cell lines. These results suggest that sialomucin may play a role in reducing the friction of pleural mesothelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
The firing activity of dorso-medial-striatal-cholinergic interneurons (dmCINs) is a neural correlate of classical conditioning. Tonically active, they pause in response to salient stimuli, mediating acquisition of predictive cues/outcome associations. Cortical and thalamic inputs are typical of the rather limited knowledge about underlying circuitry contributing to this function. Here, we dissect the midbrain GABA and glutamate-to-dmCIN pathways and evaluate how they influence conditioned behavior. We report that midbrain neurons discriminate auditory cues and encode the association of a predictive stimulus with a footshock. Furthermore, GABA and glutamate cells form selective monosynaptic contacts onto dmCINs and di-synaptic ones via the parafascicular thalamus. Pathway-specific inhibition of each sub-circuit produces differential impairments of fear-conditioned learning. Finally, Vglut2-expressing cells discriminate between CSs although Vgat-positive neurons associate the predictive cue with the outcome. Overall, these data suggest that each component of the network carries information pertinent to sub-domains of the behavioral strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal activity increases energy consumption and requires balanced production to maintain neuronal function. How activity is coupled to energy production remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that Rheb regulates mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle flux of acetyl-CoA by activating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to increase ATP production. Rheb is induced by synaptic activity and lactate and dynamically trafficked to the mitochondrial matrix through its interaction with Tom20. Mitochondria-localized Rheb protein is required for activity-induced PDH activation and ATP production. Cell-type-specific gain- and loss-of-function genetic models for Rheb reveal reciprocal changes in PDH phosphorylation/activity, acetyl-CoA, and ATP that are not evident with genetic or pharmacological manipulations of mTORC1. Mechanistically, Rheb physically associates with PDH phosphatase (PDP), enhancing its activity and association with the catalytic E1α-subunit of PDH to reduce PDH phosphorylation and increase its activity. Findings identify Rheb as a nodal point that balances neuronal activity and neuroenergetics via Rheb-PDH axis.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosome-related organelles (LROs) are endosomal compartments carrying tissue-specific proteins, which become enlarged in Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) due to mutations in LYST. Here, we show that Drosophila Mauve, a counterpart of LYST, suppresses vesicle fusion events with lipid droplets (LDs) during the formation of yolk granules (YGs), the LROs of the syncytial embryo, and opposes Rab5, which promotes fusion. Mauve localizes on YGs and at spindle poles, and it co-immunoprecipitates with the LDs’ component and microtubule-associated protein Minispindles/Ch-TOG. Minispindles levels are increased at the enlarged YGs and diminished around centrosomes in mauve-derived mutant embryos. This leads to decreased microtubule nucleation from centrosomes, a defect that can be rescued by dominant-negative Rab5. Together, this reveals an unanticipated link between endosomal vesicles and centrosomes. These findings establish Mauve/LYST’s role in regulating LRO formation and centrosome behavior, a role that could account for the enlarged LROs and centrosome positioning defects at the immune synapse of CHS patients.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria and archaea apply CRISPR-Cas surveillance complexes to defend against foreign invaders. These invading genetic elements are captured and integrated into the CRISPR array as spacer elements, guiding sequence-specific DNA/RNA targeting and cleavage. Recently, in vivo studies have shown that target RNAs with extended complementarity with repeat sequences flanking the target element (tag:anti-tag pairing) can dramatically reduce RNA cleavage by the type VI-A Cas13a system. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of Leptotrichia shahii LshCas13acrRNA in complex with target RNA harboring tag:anti-tag pairing complementarity, with the observed conformational changes providing a molecular explanation for inactivation of the composite HEPN domain cleavage activity. These structural insights, together with in vitro biochemical and in vivo cell-based assays on key mutants, define the molecular principles underlying Cas13a’s capacity to target and discriminate between self and non-self RNA targets. Our studies illuminate approaches to regulate Cas13a’s cleavage activity, thereby influencing Cas13a-mediated biotechnological applications.

Abstract: Summary
MDMX is overexpressed in the vast majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We report that MDMX overexpression increases preleukemic stem cell (pre-LSC) number and competitive advantage. Utilizing five newly generated murine models, we found that MDMX overexpression triggers progression of multiple chronic/asymptomatic preleukemic conditions to overt AML. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies revealed that MDMX overexpression exerts this function, unexpectedly, through activation of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in pre-LSCs. Mechanistically, MDMX binds CK1α and leads to accumulation of β-Catenin in a p53-independent manner. Wnt/β-Catenin inhibitors reverse MDMX-induced pre-LSC properties, and synergize with MDMX-p53 inhibitors. Wnt/β-Catenin signaling correlates with MDMX expression in patients with preleukemic myelodysplastic syndromes and is associated with increased risk of progression to AML. Our work identifies MDMX overexpression as a pervasive preleukemic-to-AML transition mechanism in different genetically driven disease subtypes, and reveals Wnt/β-Catenin as a non-canonical MDMX-driven pathway with therapeutic potential for progression prevention and cancer interception.

Abstract: Summary
Redox cofactor production is integral toward antioxidant generation, clearance of reactive oxygen species, and overall tumor response to ionizing radiation treatment. To identify systems-level alterations in redox metabolism that confer resistance to radiation therapy, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline for integrating multi-omics data into personalized genome-scale flux balance analysis models of 716 radiation-sensitive and 199 radiation-resistant tumors. These models collectively predicted that radiation-resistant tumors reroute metabolic flux to increase mitochondrial NADPH stores and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. Simulated genome-wide knockout screens agreed with experimental siRNA gene knockdowns in matched radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant cancer cell lines, revealing gene targets involved in mitochondrial NADPH production, central carbon metabolism, and folate metabolism that allow for selective inhibition of glutathione production and H2O2 clearance in radiation-resistant cancers. This systems approach represents a significant advancement in developing quantitative genome-scale models of redox metabolism and identifying personalized metabolic targets for improving radiation sensitivity in individual cancer patients.

Abstract: Summary
Intrathymic development of committed progenitor (pro)-T cells from multipotent hematopoietic precursors offers an opportunity to dissect the molecular circuitry establishing cell identity in response to environmental signals. This transition encompasses programmed shutoff of stem/progenitor genes, upregulation of T cell specification genes, proliferation, and ultimately commitment. To explain these features in light of reported cis-acting chromatin effects and experimental kinetic data, we develop a three-level dynamic model of commitment based upon regulation of the commitment-linked gene Bcl11b. The levels are (1) a core gene regulatory network (GRN) architecture from transcription factor (TF) perturbation data, (2) a stochastically controlled chromatin-state gate, and (3) a single-cell proliferation model validated by experimental clonal growth and commitment kinetic assays. Using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) measurements of genes encoding key TFs and measured bulk population dynamics, this single-cell model predicts state-switching kinetics validated by measured clonal proliferation and commitment times. The resulting multi-scale model provides a mechanistic framework for dissecting commitment dynamics.

Abstract: Advanced platelet-rich fibrin (A-PRF) is an autogenous biological material obtained from peripheral blood. A-PRF extract (A-PRFe) contains a high concentration of various cytokines that are increasingly appreciated for their roles in improving stem cell repairing function during tissue regeneration. However, the optimal A-PRFe concentration to stimulate stem cells is unknown. This study aimed to identify the optimal concentrations of A-PRFe to promote adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). We produced A-PRFe from A-PRF clots by centrifuging fresh peripheral blood samples and isolated and identified ASCs using surface CD markers and multilineage differentiation potential. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed the concentrations of several cytokines, including b-FGF, PDGF-BB, and others, increased gradually, peaked on day 7 and then decreased. Cell proliferation assays showed A-PRFe significantly stimulated ASC proliferation, and proliferation significantly increased at higher A-PRFe doses. The degree of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation increased at higher A-PRFe concentrations in the culture medium, as determined by oil red O and alizarin red staining. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that expression levels of genes related to adipogenic/osteogenic differentiation (PPARγ2, C/EBPα, FABP4, Adiponectin, and ALP, OPN, OCN, RUNX2), paracrine (HIF-1α, VEGF, IGF-2) and immunoregulation (HSP70, IL-8) function were higher in groups with a higher concentration of A-PRFe than in lower concentration groups. This study demonstrates that A-PRFe is ideal for use in ASC applications in regenerative medicine because it improves biological functions, including proliferation, adipogenic/osteogenic differentiation, and paracrine function in a dose-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Vinculin, a mechanotransducer associated with both adherens junctions (AJs) and focal adhesions (FAs), plays a central role in force transmission through cell-cell and cell-substratum contacts. We generated the conditional knockout (cKO) of vinculin in murine skin that results in the loss of bulge stem cell (BuSC) quiescence and promotes continual cycling of the hair follicles. Surprisingly, we find that the AJs in vinculin cKO cells are mechanically weak and impaired in force generation despite increased junctional expression of E-cadherin and α-catenin. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that vinculin functions by keeping α-catenin in a stretched/open conformation, which in turn regulates the retention of YAP1, another potent mechanotransducer and regulator of cell proliferation, at the AJs. Altogether, our data provide mechanistic insights into the hitherto-unexplored regulatory link between the mechanical stability of cell junctions and contact-inhibition-mediated maintenance of BuSC quiescence.

Abstract: Summary
The Integrator is a specialized 3′ end-processing complex involved in cleavage and transcription termination of a subset of nascent RNA polymerase II transcripts, including small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). We provide evidence of the modular nature of the Integrator complex by biochemically characterizing its two subcomplexes, INTS5/8 and INTS10/13/14. Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined a 3.5-Å-resolution structure of the INTS4/9/11 ternary complex, which constitutes Integrator’s catalytic core. Our structure reveals the spatial organization of the catalytic nuclease INTS11, bound to its catalytically impaired homolog INTS9 via several interdependent interfaces. INTS4, a helical repeat protein, plays a key role in stabilizing nuclease domains and other components. In this assembly, all three proteins form a composite electropositive groove, suggesting a putative RNA binding path within the complex. Comparison with other 3′ end-processing machineries points to distinct features and a unique architecture of the Integrator’s catalytic module.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic role of micropeptides generated from untranslated regions remains unclear. Here we describe MP31, a micropeptide encoded by the upstream open reading frame (uORF) of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) acting as a “circuit breaker” that limits lactate-pyruvate conversion in mitochondria by competing with mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase (mLDH) for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Knocking out the MP31 homolog in mice enhanced global lactate metabolism, manifesting as accelerated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and increased lactate consumption and production. Conditional knockout (cKO) of MP31 homolog in mouse astrocytes initiated gliomagenesis and shortened the overall survival of the animals, establishing a tumor-suppressing role for MP31. Recombinant MP31 administered intraperitoneally penetrated the blood-brain barrier and inhibited mice GBM xenografts without neurological toxicity, suggesting the clinical implication and application of this micropeptide. Our findings reveal a novel mode of MP31-orchestrated lactate metabolism reprogramming in glioblastoma.

Abstract: Summary
The intestine is under constant exposure to chemicals, antigens, and microorganisms from the external environment. Apical aspects of transporting epithelial cells (enterocytes) form a brush-border membrane (BBM), shaped by packed microvilli coated with a dense glycocalyx. We present evidence showing that the glycocalyx forms an epithelial barrier that prevents exogenous molecules and live bacteria from gaining access to BBM. We use a multi-omics approach to investigate the function and regulation of membrane mucins exposed on the BBM during postnatal development of the mouse small intestine. Muc17 is identified as a major membrane mucin in the glycocalyx that is specifically upregulated by IL-22 as part of an epithelial defense repertoire during weaning. High levels of IL-22 at time of weaning reprogram neonatal postmitotic progenitor enterocytes to differentiate into Muc17-expressing enterocytes, as found in the adult intestine during homeostasis. Our findings propose a role for Muc17 in epithelial barrier function in the small intestine.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) arise during embryonic development and are essential for sustaining the blood and immune systems throughout life. Tight regulation of HSPC numbers is critical for hematopoietic homeostasis. Here, we identified DEAD-box helicase 41 (Ddx41) as a gatekeeper of HSPC production. Using zebrafish ddx41 mutants, we unveiled a critical role for this helicase in regulating HSPC production at the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. We determined that Ddx41 suppresses the accumulation of R-loops, nucleic acid structures consisting of RNA:DNA hybrids and ssDNAs whose equilibrium is essential for cellular fitness. Excess R-loop levels in ddx41 mutants triggered the cGAS-STING inflammatory pathway leading to increased numbers of hemogenic endothelium and HSPCs. Elevated R-loop accumulation and inflammatory signaling were observed in human cells with decreased DDX41, suggesting possible conservation of mechanism. These findings delineate that precise regulation of R-loop levels during development is critical for limiting cGAS-STING activity and HSPC numbers.

Abstract: Summary
Crop productivity depends on activity of meristems that produce optimized plant architectures, including that of the maize ear. A comprehensive understanding of development requires insight into the full diversity of cell types and developmental domains and the gene networks required to specify them. Until now, these were identified primarily by morphology and insights from classical genetics, which are limited by genetic redundancy and pleiotropy. Here, we investigated the transcriptional profiles of 12,525 single cells from developing maize ears. The resulting developmental atlas provides a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) map of an inflorescence. We validated our results by mRNA in situ hybridization and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) RNA-seq, and we show how these data may facilitate genetic studies by predicting genetic redundancy, integrating transcriptional networks, and identifying candidate genes associated with crop yield traits.

Abstract: Summary
In contrast to our extensive knowledge on covalent small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) target proteins, we are limited in our understanding of non-covalent SUMO-binding proteins. We identify interactors of different SUMO isoforms—monomeric SUMO1, monomeric SUMO2, or linear trimeric SUMO2 chains—using a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach. We identify 379 proteins that bind to different SUMO isoforms, mainly in a preferential manner. Interestingly, XRCC4 is the only DNA repair protein in our screen with a preference for SUMO2 trimers over mono-SUMO2, as well as the only protein in our screen that belongs to the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA double-strand break repair pathway. A SUMO interaction motif (SIM) in XRCC4 regulates its recruitment to sites of DNA damage and phosphorylation of S320 by DNA-PKcs. Our data highlight the importance of non-covalent and covalent sumoylation for DNA double-strand break repair via the NHEJ pathway and provide a resource of SUMO isoform interactors.

Abstract: Summary
In many animal models, primordial germ cell (PGC) development depends on maternally deposited germ plasm, which prevents somatic cell fate. Here, we show that PGCs respond to regulatory information from the germ plasm in two distinct phases using two distinct mechanisms in zebrafish. We demonstrate that PGCs commence zygotic genome activation together with the somatic blastocysts with no demonstrable differences in transcriptional and chromatin opening. Unexpectedly, both PGC and somatic blastocysts activate germ-cell-specific genes, which are only stabilized in PGCs by cytoplasmic germ plasm determinants. Disaggregated perinuclear relocalization of germ plasm during PGC migration is regulated by the germ plasm determinant Tdrd7 and is coupled to dramatic divergence between PGC and somatic transcriptomes. This transcriptional divergence relies on PGC-specific cis-regulatory elements characterized by promoter-proximal distribution. We show that Tdrd7-dependent reconfiguration of chromatin accessibility is required for elaboration of PGC fate but not for PGC migration.

Abstract: As we move through the environment we experience constantly changing sensory input that must be merged with our ongoing motor behaviors - creating dynamic interactions between our sensory and motor systems. Active behaviors such as locomotion generally increase the sensory-evoked neuronal activity in visual and somatosensory cortices, but evidence suggests that locomotion largely suppresses neuronal responses in the auditory cortex. However, whether this effect is ubiquitous across different anatomical regions of the auditory cortex is largely unknown. In mice, auditory association fields such as the dorsal auditory cortex (AuD), have been shown to have different physiological response properties, protein expression patterns, and cortical as well as subcortical connections, in comparison to primary auditory regions (A1) - suggesting there may be important functional differences. Here we examined locomotion-related modulation of neuronal activity in cortical layers ⅔ of AuD and A1 using two-photon Ca2+ imaging in head-fixed behaving mice that are able to freely run on a spherical treadmill. We determined the proportion of neurons in these two auditory regions that show enhanced and suppressed sensory-evoked responses during locomotion and quantified the depth of modulation. We found that A1 shows more suppression and AuD more enhanced responses during locomotion periods. We further revealed differences in the circuitry between these auditory regions and motor cortex, and found that AuD is more highly connected to motor cortical regions. Finally, we compared the cell-type specific locomotion-evoked modulation of responses in AuD and found that, while subpopulations of PV-expressing interneurons showed heterogeneous responses, the population in general was largely suppressed during locomotion, while excitatory population responses were generally enhanced in AuD. Therefore, neurons in primary and dorsal auditory fields have distinct response properties, with dorsal regions exhibiting enhanced activity in response to movement. This functional distinction may be important for auditory processing during navigation and acoustically guided behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin is a barrier to efficient DNA repair, as it hinders access and processing of certain DNA lesions. ALC1/CHD1L is a nucleosome-remodeling enzyme that responds to DNA damage, but its precise function in DNA repair remains unknown. Here we report that loss of ALC1 confers sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, methyl-methanesulfonate, and uracil misincorporation, which reflects the need to remodel nucleosomes following base excision by DNA glycosylases but prior to handover to APEX1. Using CRISPR screens, we establish that ALC1 loss is synthetic lethal with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), which we attribute to chromosome instability caused by unrepaired DNA gaps at replication forks. In the absence of ALC1 or APEX1, incomplete processing of BER intermediates results in post-replicative DNA gaps and a critical dependence on HR for repair. Hence, targeting ALC1 alone or as a PARP inhibitor sensitizer could be employed to augment existing therapeutic strategies for HRD cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Hypoxia, low oxygen (O2), is a key feature of all solid cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout library screening is used to identify reliable therapeutic targets responsible for hypoxic survival in HCC. We find that protein-tyrosine phosphatase mitochondrial 1 (PTPMT1), an important enzyme for cardiolipin (CL) synthesis, is the most significant gene and ranks just after hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-1β as crucial to hypoxic survival. CL constitutes the mitochondrial membrane and ensures the proper assembly of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes for efficient electron transfer in respiration. ETC becomes highly unstable during hypoxia. Knockout of PTPMT1 stops the maturation of CL and impairs the assembly of ETC complexes, leading to further electron leakage and ROS accumulation at ETC in hypoxia. Excitingly, HCC cells, especially under hypoxic conditions, show great sensitivity toward PTPMT1 inhibitor alexidine dihydrochloride (AD). This study unravels the protective roles of PTPMT1 in hypoxic survival and cancer development.

Abstract: Summary
Colonial tunicates are the only chordate that possess two distinct developmental pathways to produce an adult body: either sexually through embryogenesis or asexually through a stem cell-mediated renewal termed blastogenesis. Using the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri, we combine transcriptomics and microscopy to build an atlas of the molecular and morphological signatures at each developmental stage for both pathways. The general molecular profiles of these processes are largely distinct. However, the relative timing of organogenesis and ordering of tissue-specific gene expression are conserved. By comparing the developmental pathways of B. schlosseri with other chordates, we identify hundreds of putative transcription factors with conserved temporal expression. Our findings demonstrate that convergent morphology need not imply convergent molecular mechanisms but that it showcases the importance that tissue-specific stem cells and transcription factors play in producing the same mature body through different pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils can function and survive in injured and infected tissues, where oxygen and metabolic substrates are limited. Using radioactive flux assays and LC-MS tracing with U-13C glucose, glutamine, and pyruvate, we observe that neutrophils require the generation of intracellular glycogen stores by gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis for effective survival and bacterial killing. These metabolic adaptations are dynamic, with net increases in glycogen stores observed following LPS challenge or altitude-induced hypoxia. Neutrophils from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have reduced glycogen cycling, resulting in impaired function. Metabolic specialization of neutrophils may therefore underpin disease pathology and allow selective therapeutic targeting.

Abstract: Summary
Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is a genetically modified herpes simplex 1 virus (HSV-1) approved for cancer therapy. We investigate its effect on the clinical, histological, single-cell transcriptomic, and immune repertoire level using repeated fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) of injected and noninjected lesions in primary cutaneous B cell lymphoma (pCBCL). Thirteen patients received intralesional T-VEC, 11 of which demonstrate tumor response in the injected lesions. Using single-cell sequencing of the FNAs, we identify the malignant population and separate three pCBCL subtypes. Twenty-four hours after the injection, we detect HSV-1T-VEC transcripts in malignant and nonmalignant cells of the injected lesion but not of the noninjected lesion. Oncolytic virotherapy results in a rapid eradication of malignant cells. It also leads to interferon pathway activation and early influx of natural killer cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. These events are followed by enrichment in cytotoxic T cells and a decrease of regulatory T cells in injected and noninjected lesions.

Abstract: Summary
FGF23 interacts with a FGFR/KL-receptor complex to propagate cellular signaling, where its C-terminal C26 peptide is critical for engaging the co-receptor KL. We identify a distinct peptide sequence C28 residing in the FGF23 C terminus that regulates its interaction with KL. C28 can independently function as an FGF23 antagonist, and we report an optimized peptide antagonist of much enhanced potency. FGF23 can use either of the two C-terminal sites to exert biological effects, as shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. The loss of both KL-interaction sites inactivates the protein. We conclude that the C terminus of FGF23 is a bidentate ligand possessing two independent KL-interaction sites. The identification of this second KL-association site provides an additional perspective in the molecular basis of FGF23-receptor signaling and raises questions pertaining to its structural mechanism of action and the potential for biased biological signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Individuals with malaria exhibit increased morbidity and mortality when infected with Gram-negative (Gr−) bacteria. To explore this experimentally, we performed co-infection of mice with Plasmodium chabaudi and Citrobacter rodentium, an extracellular Gr− bacterial pathogen that infects the large intestine. While single infections are controlled effectively, co-infection results in enhanced virulence that is characterized by prolonged systemic bacterial persistence and high mortality. Mortality in co-infected mice is associated with disrupted iron metabolism, elevated levels of plasma heme, and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by phagocytes. In addition, iron acquisition by the bacterium plays a key role in pathogenesis because co-infection with a mutant C. rodentium strain lacking a critical iron acquisition pathway does not cause mortality. These results indicate that disrupted iron metabolism may drive mortality during co-infection with C. rodentium and P. chabaudi by both altering host immune responses and facilitating bacterial persistence.

Abstract: Wnt5a is a non-canonical Wnt ligand that is essential for normal embryonic development in mammals. The role of Wnt5a in early intestinal development has been examined in gene ablation models, where Wnt5a−/− mice exhibit strikingly shortened intestines. However, the exact cellular source of Wnt5a has remained elusive, until a recent study found that FoxL1-expressing mesenchymal cells (FoxL1+ cells), which are localized directly beneath the intestinal epithelium, express Wnt5a. To determine whether FoxL1+ cells are a required source of Wnt5a during intestinal development, we derived FoxL1-Cre; Wnt5af/f mice, which is the first mouse model to ablate Wnt5a in a cell type-specific manner in the intestine in vivo. Our results show that Wnt5a deletion in FoxL1+ cells during fetal life causes a shortened gut phenotype in neonatal mice, and that our model is sufficient to increase rate of apoptosis in the elongating epithelium, thus explaining the shortened gut phenotype. However, in contrast to previous studies using Wnt5a null mice, we did not observe dysregulation of epithelial structure or apical-basal protein localization. Altogether, our findings establish a developmental role for FoxL1+ mesenchymal cells in controlling non-canonical Wnt signaling during midgut elongation.

Abstract: Summary
Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is an important molecular chaperone in plants. However, HSP90-mediated plant immune response remains elusive in cassava. In this study, cassava bacterial blight (CBB) induces the expression of MeHsf8, which directly targets MeHSP90.9 to activate its expression and immune response. Further identification of SHI-related sequence 1 (MeSRS1) and MeWRKY20 as MeHSP90.9 co-chaperones revealed the underlying mechanism of MeHSP90.9-mediated immune response. MeHSP90.9 interacts with MeSRS1 and MeWRKY20 to promote their transcriptional activation of salicylic acid (SA) biosynthetic gene avrPphB Susceptible 3 (MePBS3) and tryptophan metabolic gene N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase 2 (MeASMT2), respectively, so as to activate SA biosynthesis but inhibit tryptophan-derived auxin biosynthesis. Notably, genetic experiments confirmed that overexpressing MePBS3 and MeASMT2 could rescue the effects of silencing MeHsf8-MeHSP90.9 on disease resistance. This study highlights the dual regulation of SA and auxin biosynthesis by MeHSP90.9, providing the mechanistic understanding of MeHSP90.9 client partners in plant immunity.

Abstract: Summary
SOX17 has been implicated in arterial specification and the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the murine embryo. However, knowledge about molecular pathways and stage-specific effects of SOX17 in humans remains limited. Here, using SOX17-knockout and SOX17-inducible human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), paired with molecular profiling studies, we reveal that SOX17 is a master regulator of HOXA and arterial programs in hemogenic endothelium (HE) and is required for the specification of HE with robust lympho-myeloid potential and DLL4+CXCR4+ phenotype resembling arterial HE at the sites of HSC emergence. Along with the activation of NOTCH signaling, SOX17 directly activates CDX2 expression, leading to the upregulation of the HOXA cluster genes. Since deficiencies in HOXA and NOTCH signaling contribute to the impaired in vivo engraftment of hPSC-derived hematopoietic cells, the identification of SOX17 as a key regulator linking arterial and HOXA programs in HE may help to program HSC fate from hPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Conflicts between the replication and transcription machineries have profound effects on chromosome duplication, genome organization, and evolution across species. Head-on conflicts (lagging-strand genes) are significantly more detrimental than codirectional conflicts (leading-strand genes). The fundamental reason for this difference is unknown. Here, we report that topological stress significantly contributes to this difference. We find that head-on, but not codirectional, conflict resolution requires the relaxation of positive supercoils by the type II topoisomerases DNA gyrase and Topo IV, at least in the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Interestingly, our data suggest that after positive supercoil resolution, gyrase introduces excessive negative supercoils at head-on conflict regions, driving pervasive R-loop formation. Altogether, our results reveal a fundamental mechanistic difference between the two types of encounters, addressing a long-standing question in the field of replication-transcription conflicts.

Abstract: Summary
ER tubules form and maintain membrane contact sites (MCSs) with endosomes. How and why these ER-endosome MCSs persist as endosomes traffic and mature is poorly understood. Here we find that a member of the reticulon protein family, Reticulon-3L (Rtn3L), enriches at ER-endosome MCSs as endosomes mature. We show that this localization is due to the long divergent N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Rtn3L. We found that Rtn3L is recruited to ER-endosome MCSs by endosomal protein Rab9a, which marks a transition stage between early and late endosomes. Rab9a utilizes an FSV region to recruit Rtn3L via its six LC3-interacting region motifs. Consistent with our localization results, depletion or deletion of RTN3 from cells results in endosome maturation and cargo sorting defects, similar to RAB9A depletion. Together our data identify a tubular ER protein that promotes endosome maturation at ER MCSs.

Abstract: Summary
Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes diverse human diseases, including life-threatening soft-tissue infections. It is accepted that the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 protects the host by killing GAS. Here, we show that GAS extracellular protease ScpC N-terminally cleaves LL-37 into two fragments of 8 and 29 amino acids, preserving its bactericidal activity. At sub-bactericidal concentrations, the cleavage inhibits LL-37-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis, shortens neutrophil lifespan, and eliminates P2X7 and EGF receptors’ activation. Mutations at the LL-37 cleavage site protect the peptide from ScpC-mediated splitting, maintaining all its functions. The mouse LL-37 ortholog CRAMP is neither cleaved by ScpC nor does it activate P2X7 or EGF receptors. Treating wild-type or CRAMP-null mice with sub-bactericidal concentrations of the non-cleavable LL-37 analogs promotes GAS clearance that is abolished by the administration of either P2X7 or EGF receptor antagonists. We demonstrate that LL-37-mediated activation of host receptors is critical for defense against GAS soft-tissue infections.

Abstract: Summary
Given the immune system's importance for cancer surveillance and treatment, we have investigated how it may be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection of cancer patients. Across some heterogeneity in tumor type, stage, and treatment, virus-exposed solid cancer patients display a dominant impact of SARS-CoV-2, apparent from the resemblance of their immune signatures to those for COVID-19+ non-cancer patients. This is not the case for hematological malignancies, with virus-exposed patients collectively displaying heterogeneous humoral responses, an exhausted T cell phenotype and a high prevalence of prolonged virus shedding. Furthermore, while recovered solid cancer patients' immunophenotypes resemble those of non-virus-exposed cancer patients, recovered hematological cancer patients display distinct, lingering immunological legacies. Thus, while solid cancer patients, including those with advanced disease, seem no more at risk of SARS-CoV-2-associated immune dysregulation than the general population, hematological cancer patients show complex immunological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 exposure that might usefully inform their care.

Abstract: Actin re-organization and degradation of extracellular matrix by metalloproteases (MMPs) facilitate formation of cellular protrusions that are required for cell proliferation and migration. We find that Zn2+ activation of the Gq-coupled receptor ZnR/GPR39 controls these processes by regulating K+/Cl− co-transporter KCC3, which modulates cell volume. Silencing of KCC3 expression or activity reverses ZnR/GPR39 enhancement of cell proliferation, migration and invasion through Matrigel. Activation of ZnR/GPR39 recruits KCC3 into F-actin rich membrane protrusions, suggesting that it can locally control volume changes. Immunofluorescence analysis indicates that Zn2+ activation of ZnR/GPR39 and KCC3 are required to enhance formation of F-actin stress fibers and cellular protrusions. In addition, ZnR/GPR39 upregulation of KCC3-dependent transport increases the activity of matrix metalloproteases MMP2 and MMP9. Our study establishes a mechanism in which ZnR/GPR39 orchestrates localization and activation of KCC3, formation of F-actin rich cell protrusions and activation of MMPs, and thereby controls cell proliferation and migration.

Abstract: Summary
MED1 (mediator subunit 1) co-amplifies with HER2, but its role in HER2-driven mammary tumorigenesis is still unknown. Here, we generate MED1 mammary-specific overexpression mice and cross them with mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-HER2 mice. We observe significantly promoted onset, growth, metastasis, and multiplicity of HER2 tumors by MED1 overexpression. Further studies reveal critical roles for MED1 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer stem cell formation, and response to anti-HER2 therapy. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptome analyses and clinical sample correlation studies identify Jab1, a component of the COP9 signalosome complex, as the key direct target gene of MED1 contributing to these processes. Further studies reveal that Jab1 can also reciprocally regulate the stability and transcriptional activity of MED1. Together, our findings support a functional cooperation between these co-amplified genes in HER2+ mammary tumorigenesis and their potential usage as therapeutic targets for the treatment of HER2+ breast cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Lung metastasis is the major cause of breast cancer-related mortality. The neutrophil-associated inflammatory microenvironment aids tumor cells in metastatic colonization in lungs. Here, we show that tumor-secreted protease cathepsin C (CTSC) promotes breast-to-lung metastasis by regulating recruitment of neutrophils and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). CTSC enzymatically activates neutrophil membrane-bound proteinase 3 (PR3) to facilitate interleukin-1β (IL-1β) processing and nuclear factor κB activation, thus upregulating IL-6 and CCL3 for neutrophil recruitment. In addition, the CTSC-PR3-IL-1β axis induces neutrophil reactive oxygen species production and formation of NETs, which degrade thrombospondin-1 and support metastatic growth of cancer cells in the lungs. CTSC expression and secretion are associated with NET formation and lung metastasis in human breast tumors. Importantly, targeting CTSC with compound AZD7986 effectively suppresses lung metastasis of breast cancer in a mouse model. Overall, our findings reveal a mechanism of how tumor cells regulate neutrophils in metastatic niches and support CTSC-targeting approaches for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Low-grade mitochondrial stress can promote health and longevity, a phenomenon termed mitohormesis. Here, we demonstrate the opposing metabolic effects of low-level and high-level mitochondrial ribosomal (mitoribosomal) stress in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. POMC neuron-specific severe mitoribosomal stress due to Crif1 homodeficiency causes obesity in mice. By contrast, mild mitoribosomal stress caused by Crif1 heterodeficiency in POMC neurons leads to high-turnover metabolism and resistance to obesity. These metabolic benefits are mediated by enhanced thermogenesis and mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPRmt) in distal adipose tissues. In POMC neurons, partial Crif1 deficiency increases the expression of β-endorphin (β-END) and mitochondrial DNA-encoded peptide MOTS-c. Central administration of MOTS-c or β-END recapitulates the adipose phenotype of Crif1 heterodeficient mice, suggesting these factors as potential mediators. Consistently, regular running exercise at moderate intensity stimulates hypothalamic MOTS-c/β-END expression and induces adipose tissue UPRmt and thermogenesis. Our findings indicate that POMC neuronal mitohormesis may underlie exercise-induced high-turnover metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, perivascular cell-derived scarring after spinal cord injury impedes axonal regrowth. In contrast, the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the spinal lesion site of zebrafish is permissive and required for axon regeneration. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying this interspecies difference have not been investigated. Here, we show that an injury to the zebrafish spinal cord triggers recruitment of pdgfrb+ myoseptal and perivascular cells in a PDGFR signaling-dependent manner. Interference with pdgfrb+ cell recruitment or depletion of pdgfrb+ cells inhibits axonal regrowth and recovery of locomotor function. Transcriptional profiling and functional experiments reveal that pdgfrb+ cells upregulate expression of axon growth-promoting ECM genes (cthrc1a and col12a1a/b) and concomitantly reduce synthesis of matrix molecules that are detrimental to regeneration (lum and mfap2). Our data demonstrate that a switch in ECM composition is critical for axon regeneration after spinal cord injury and identify the cellular source and components of the growth-promoting lesion ECM.

Abstract: Summary
Splicing is a central RNA-based process commonly altered in human cancers; however, how spliceosomal components are co-opted during tumorigenesis remains poorly defined. Here we unravel the core splice factor SF3A3 at the nexus of a translation-based program that rewires splicing during malignant transformation. Upon MYC hyperactivation, SF3A3 levels are modulated translationally through an RNA stem-loop in an eIF3D-dependent manner. This ensures accurate splicing of mRNAs enriched for mitochondrial regulators. Altered SF3A3 translation leads to metabolic reprogramming and stem-like properties that fuel MYC tumorigenic potential in vivo. Our analysis reveals that SF3A3 protein levels predict molecular and phenotypic features of aggressive human breast cancers. These findings unveil a post-transcriptional interplay between splicing and translation that governs critical facets of MYC-driven oncogenesis.

Abstract: Bacterial infections are the most eminent public health challenge of the 21st century. The primary step leading to infection is bacterial adhesion to the surface of host cells or medical devices, which is mediated by a multitude of molecular interactions. At the interface of life sciences and physics, last years advances in atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based force spectroscopy techniques have made possible to measure the forces driving bacteria-cell and bacteria-materials interactions on a single molecule/cell basis (single molecule/cell force spectroscopy). Among the bacteria-(bio)materials surface interactions, the life-threatening infections associated to medical devices involving Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli are the most eminent. On the other hand, Pseudomonas aeruginosa binding to the pulmonary and urinary tract or the Helicobacter pylori binding to the gastric mucosa, are classical examples of bacteria-host cell interactions that end in serious infections. As we approach the end of the antibiotic era, acquisition of a deeper knowledge of the fundamental forces involved in bacteria – host cells/(bio)materials surface adhesion is crucial for the identification of new ligand-binding events and its assessment as novel targets for alternative anti-infective therapies. This article aims to highlight the potential of AFM-based force spectroscopy for new targeted therapies development against bacterial infections in which adhesion plays a pivotal role and does not aim to be an extensive overview on the AFM technical capabilities and theory of single molecule force spectroscopy.

Abstract: Several studies have shown a relationship between the distribution of fat mass around the organism, metabolic disorders, and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It has been demonstrated that in obese animals there is a big rise in the white fat deposits due to hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the adipocytes. Studies related to weight and health have been more popular regarding obesity rather than extreme caquexia or calorico-proteic deficiencies, but these states are interesting from the point of view of the preferential atrophy of certain organs that may help us in the understanding of undernourishment. Moreover, the discovery of beige adipose tissue has instigated thoughts around the roles played by the different cells in the adipose tissue as well as its adaptability in pathological states. In our study we carried out morphometric, morphological, and quantitative measurements of the adipose tissue in an animal model based on a 40−50% diet restriction in comparison to control animals. We have found a decrease in the size of white adipocytes together with a variation in the lipid droplet size of brown adipocytes in undernourished animals, what may be considered as possible transformations between the types of adipose tissues, and that could be caused by an adaptive phenomenon to the undernourished state.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancers harbor binding motifs that recruit transcription factors (TFs) for gene activation. While cooperative binding of TFs at enhancers is known to be critical for transcriptional activation of a handful of developmental enhancers, the extent of TF cooperativity genome-wide is unknown. Here, we couple high-resolution nuclease footprinting with single-molecule methylation profiling to characterize TF cooperativity at active enhancers in the Drosophila genome. Enrichment of short micrococcal nuclease (MNase)-protected DNA segments indicates that the majority of enhancers harbor two or more TF-binding sites, and we uncover protected fragments that correspond to co-bound sites in thousands of enhancers. From the analysis of co-binding, we find that cooperativity dominates TF binding in vivo at the majority of active enhancers. Cooperativity is highest between sites spaced 50 bp apart, indicating that cooperativity occurs without apparent protein-protein interactions. Our findings suggest nucleosomes promoting cooperativity because co-binding may effectively clear nucleosomes and promote enhancer function.

Abstract: Summary
In diseased states, the heart can shift to use different carbon substrates, measured through changes in uptake of metabolites by imaging methods or blood metabolomics. However, it is not known whether these measured changes are a result of transcriptional changes or external factors. Here, we explore transcriptional changes in late-stage heart failure using publicly available data integrated with a model of heart metabolism. First, we present a heart-specific genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction (GENRE), iCardio. Next, we demonstrate the utility of iCardio in interpreting heart failure gene expression data by identifying tasks inferred from differential expression (TIDEs), which represent metabolic functions associated with changes in gene expression. We identify decreased gene expression for nitric oxide (NO) and N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) synthesis as common metabolic markers of heart failure. The methods presented here for constructing a tissue-specific model and identifying TIDEs can be extended to multiple tissues and diseases of interest.

Decreased miR-26a expression in H2O2-treated newborn murine ventricular cardiomyocytes (NMVCs) was observed, as well as in the infarcted heart of MI mouse model, compared to untreated NMVCs and healthy mouse heart tissue, respectively. Conversely, the upregulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was observed in H2O2-treated NMVCs, and in infarcted hearts. An MTT assay and BrdU staining showed that H2O2 treatment attenuated cell viability in NMVCs, whereas miR-26a overexpression increased cell viability. Both TUNEL assay and flow cytometry (FC) displayed that miR-26a expression suppressed H2O2-induced cell apoptosis. Besides, miR-26a overexpression suppressed the upregulation of PTEN expression in H2O2-treated NMVCs by directly binding to PTEN 3′-UTR.
Results
PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT signal transduction pathways were found to be regulated through cross-talk between miR-26a and PTEN. Furthermore, agomiR-26a treatment in MI mouse model considerably suppressed the size of the infarcted regions, and improved cardiac activity.
Conclusions
MiR-26a expression in MI cardiac tissues was downregulated in response to H2O2 stress, whereas it could still protect against cell death by modulation of the PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT signal transduction pathways by directly targeting PTEN.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) results in durable disease control in a subset of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but mechanisms driving resistance are poorly understood. We characterize the single-cell transcriptomes of cancer and immune cells from metastatic RCC patients before or after ICB exposure. In responders, subsets of cytotoxic T cells express higher levels of co-inhibitory receptors and effector molecules. Macrophages from treated biopsies shift toward pro-inflammatory states in response to an interferon-rich microenvironment but also upregulate immunosuppressive markers. In cancer cells, we identify bifurcation into two subpopulations differing in angiogenic signaling and upregulation of immunosuppressive programs after ICB. Expression signatures for cancer cell subpopulations and immune evasion are associated with PBRM1 mutation and survival in primary and ICB-treated advanced RCC. Our findings demonstrate that ICB remodels the RCC microenvironment and modifies the interplay between cancer and immune cell populations critical for understanding response and resistance to ICB.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer, including glioblastoma (GBM). Here we report that protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 6 activity is required for the proliferation, stem-like properties, and tumorigenicity of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), a subpopulation in GBM critical for malignancy. We identified a casein kinase 2 (CK2)-PRMT6-regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1) signaling axis whose activity is an important contributor to the stem-like properties and tumor biology of GSCs. CK2 phosphorylates and stabilizes PRMT6 through deubiquitylation, which promotes PRMT6 methylation of RCC1, which in turn is required for RCC1 association with chromatin and activation of RAN. Disruption of this pathway results in defects in mitosis. EPZ020411, a specific small-molecule inhibitor for PRMT6, suppresses RCC1 arginine methylation and improves the cytotoxic activity of radiotherapy against GSC brain tumor xenografts. This study identifies a CK2α-PRMT6-RCC1 signaling axis that can be therapeutically targeted in the treatment of GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying precise targets of individual cancers remains challenging. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) represents the most common adult hematologic malignancy, and trisomy 12 (tri12) represents a quarter of CLL patients. We report that tri12 human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) allow for the identification of gene networks and targets specific to tri12, which are controlled by comparative normal PSCs. Identified targets are upregulated in tri12 leukemic cells from a cohort of 159 patients with monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis and CLL. tri12 signaling patterns significantly influence progression-free survival. Actionable targets are identified using high-content drug testing and functionally validated in an additional 44 CLL patient samples. Using xenograft models, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) inhibitor is potent and selective against human tri12 CLL versus healthy patient-derived xenografts. Our study uses hPSCs to uncover targets from genetic aberrations and apply them to cancer. These findings provide immediate translational potential as biomarkers and targets for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian genomes contain long domains with distinct average compositions of A/T versus G/C base pairs. In a screen for proteins that might interpret base composition by binding to AT-rich motifs, we identified the stem cell factor SALL4, which contains multiple zinc fingers. Mutation of the domain responsible for AT binding drastically reduced SALL4 genome occupancy and prematurely upregulated genes in proportion to their AT content. Inactivation of this single AT-binding zinc-finger cluster mimicked defects seen in Sall4 null cells, including precocious differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embryonic lethality in mice. In contrast, deletion of two other zinc-finger clusters was phenotypically neutral. Our data indicate that loss of pluripotency is triggered by downregulation of SALL4, leading to de-repression of a set of AT-rich genes that promotes neuronal differentiation. We conclude that base composition is not merely a passive byproduct of genome evolution and constitutes a signal that aids control of cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
The RAD51 recombinase forms nucleoprotein filaments to promote double-strand break repair, replication fork reversal, and fork stabilization. The stability of these filaments is highly regulated, as both too little and too much RAD51 activity can cause genome instability. RADX is a single-strand DNA (ssDNA) binding protein that regulates DNA replication. Here, we define its mechanism of action. We find that RADX inhibits RAD51 strand exchange and D-loop formation activities. RADX directly and selectively interacts with ATP-bound RAD51, stimulates ATP hydrolysis, and destabilizes RAD51 nucleofilaments. The RADX interaction with RAD51, in addition to its ssDNA binding capability, is required to maintain replication fork elongation rates and fork stability. Furthermore, BRCA2 can overcome the RADX-dependent RAD51 inhibition. Thus, RADX functions in opposition to BRCA2 in regulating RAD51 nucleofilament stability to ensure the right level of RAD51 function during DNA replication.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is characterized by loss of proteostasis and mitochondrial homeostasis. Here, we provide bioinformatic evidence of dysregulation of mitochondrial and proteostasis pathways in muscle aging and diseases. Moreover, we show accumulation of amyloid-like deposits and mitochondrial dysfunction during natural aging in the body wall muscle of C. elegans, in human primary myotubes, and in mouse skeletal muscle, partially phenocopying inclusion body myositis (IBM). Importantly, NAD+ homeostasis is critical to control age-associated muscle amyloidosis. Treatment of either aged N2 worms, a nematode model of amyloid-beta muscle proteotoxicity, human aged myotubes, or old mice with the NAD+ boosters nicotinamide riboside (NR) and olaparib (AZD) increases mitochondrial function and muscle homeostasis while attenuating amyloid accumulation. Hence, our data reveal that age-related amyloidosis is a contributing factor to mitochondrial dysfunction and that both are features of the aging muscle that can be ameliorated by NAD+ metabolism-enhancing approaches, warranting further clinical studies.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have identified topologically associating domains (TADs) and larger A/B compartments as two salient structural features of eukaryotic chromosomes. These structures are sculpted by the combined actions of transcription and structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) superfamily proteins. Bacterial chromosomes fold into TAD-like chromosomal interaction domains (CIDs) but do not display A/B compartment-type organization. We reveal that chromosomes of Sulfolobus archaea are organized into CID-like topological domains in addition to previously described larger A/B compartment-type structures. We uncover local rules governing the identity of the topological domains and their boundaries. We also identify long-range loop structures and provide evidence of a hub-like structure that colocalizes genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. In addition to providing high-resolution descriptions of archaeal chromosome architectures, our data provide evidence of multiple modes of organization in prokaryotic chromosomes and yield insights into the evolution of eukaryotic chromosome conformation.

Abstract: Summary
After spinal cord injury (SCI), normally innocuous visceral or somatic stimuli can trigger uncontrolled reflex activation of sympathetic circuitry, causing pathological dysautonomia. We show that remarkable structural remodeling and plasticity occur within spinal autonomic circuitry, creating abnormal sympathetic reflexes that promote dysautonomia. However, when mice are treated early after SCI with human-equivalent doses of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug gabapentin (GBP), it is possible to block multi-segmental excitatory synaptogenesis and abolish sprouting of autonomic neurons that innervate immune organs and sensory afferents that trigger pain and autonomic dysreflexia (AD). This “prophylactic GBP” regimen decreases the frequency and severity of AD and protects against SCI-induced immune suppression. These benefits persist even 1 month after stopping treatment. GBP could be repurposed to prevent dysautonomia in at-risk individuals with high-level SCI.

Abstract: Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) are routinely produced at several sites within the organelle. The balance in their formation and elimination is maintained by a complex and robust antioxidant system. mROS may act as second messengers and regulate a number of physiological processes, such as insulin signaling, cell differentiation and proliferation, wound healing, etc. Nevertheless, when a sudden or sustained increase in ROS formation is not efficiently neutralized by the endogenous antioxidant defense system, the detrimental impact of high mROS levels on cell function and viability eventually results in disease development. In this review, we will focus on the dual role of mROS in pathophysiology, emphasizing the physiological role exerted by a regulated mROS production/elimination, and discussing the detrimental effects evoked by an imbalance in mitochondrial redox state. Furthermore, we will touch upon the interplay between mROS and Ca2+ homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Platelets are known to enhance the wound-healing activity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the mechanism by which platelets improve the therapeutic potential of MSCs has not been elucidated. Here, we provide evidence that, upon their activation, platelets transfer respiratory-competent mitochondria to MSCs primarily via dynamin-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We found that this process enhances the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs following their engraftment in several mouse models of tissue injury, including full-thickness cutaneous wound and dystrophic skeletal muscle. By combining in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that platelet-derived mitochondria promote the pro-angiogenic activity of MSCs via their metabolic remodeling. Notably, we show that activation of the de novo fatty acid synthesis pathway is required for increased secretion of pro-angiogenic factors by platelet-preconditioned MSCs. These results reveal a new mechanism by which platelets potentiate MSC properties and underline the importance of testing platelet mitochondria quality prior to their clinical use.

Abstract: Summary
Cells in renewing tissues exhibit dramatic transcriptional changes as they differentiate. The contribution of chromatin looping to tissue renewal is incompletely understood. Enhancer-promoter interactions could be relatively stable as cells transition from progenitor to differentiated states; alternatively, chromatin looping could be as dynamic as the gene expression from their loci. The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly renewing mammalian tissue. Proliferative cells in crypts of Lieberkühn sustain a stream of differentiated cells that are continually shed into the lumen. We apply chromosome conformation capture combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) and sequencing to measure enhancer-promoter interactions in progenitor and differentiated cells of the intestinal epithelium. Despite dynamic gene regulation across the differentiation axis, we find that enhancer-promoter interactions are relatively stable. Functionally, we find HNF4 transcription factors are required for chromatin looping at target genes. Depletion of HNF4 disrupts local chromatin looping, histone modifications, and target gene expression. This study provides insights into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms governing homeostasis in renewing tissues.

Abstract: The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms a monolayer sheet separating the retina and choroid in vertebrate eyes. The polarized nature of RPE is maintained by distributing membrane proteins differentially along apico-basal axis. We found the distributions of these proteins differ in embryonic, post-natal, and mature mouse RPE, suggesting developmental regulation of protein trafficking. Thus, we deleted tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101), a key component of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), in embryonic and mature RPE to determine whether ESCRT-mediated endocytic protein trafficking correlated with the establishment and maintenance of RPE polarity. Loss of Tsg101 severely disturbed the polarity of RPE, which forms irregular aggregates exhibiting non-polarized distribution of cell adhesion proteins and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. These findings suggest that ESCRT-mediated protein trafficking is essential for the development and maintenance of RPE cell polarity.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) mediates translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosomal A site to the P site to promote translational elongation. Its phosphorylation on Thr56 by its single known kinase eEF2K inactivates it and inhibits translational elongation. Extensive studies have revealed that different signal cascades modulate eEF2K activity, but whether additional factors regulate phosphorylation of eEF2 remains unclear. Here, we find that the X chromosome-linked intellectual disability protein polyglutamine-binding protein 1 (PQBP1) specifically binds to non-phosphorylated eEF2 and suppresses eEF2K-mediated phosphorylation at Thr56. Loss of PQBP1 significantly reduces general protein synthesis by suppressing translational elongation. Moreover, we show that PQBP1 regulates hippocampal metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) and mGluR-LTD-associated behaviors by suppressing eEF2K-mediated phosphorylation. Our results identify PQBP1 as a novel regulator in translational elongation and mGluR-LTD, and this newly revealed regulator in the eEF2K/eEF2 pathway is also an excellent therapeutic target for various disease conditions, such as neural diseases, virus infection, and cancer.

Abstract: Asb2, ankyrin repeat, and SOCS box protein 2 form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Asb2 ubiquitin ligase activity drives the degradation of filamins, which have essential functions in humans. The placenta is a temporary organ that forms during pregnancy, and normal placentation is important for survival and growth of the fetus. Recent studies have shown that approximately 25-30% of knockout (KO) mice have non-viable offspring, and 68% of knockout lines exhibit placental dysmorphologies. There are very few studies on Asb2, with insufficient research on its role in placental development. Therefore, we generated Asb2 knockout mice and undertook to investigate Asb2 expression during organogenesis, and to identify its role in early embryonic and placental development. The external morphology of KO embryos revealed abnormal phenotypes including growth retardation, pericardial effusion, pale color, and especially heart beat defect from E 9.5. Furthermore, Asb2 expression was observed in the heart from E 9.5, indicating that it is specifically expressed during early heart formation, resulting in embryonic lethality. Histological analysis of E 10.5 KO heart showed malformations such as failure of chamber formation, reduction in trabeculated myocardium length, absence of mesenchymal cells, and destruction of myocardium wall. Moreover, the histological results of Asb2-deficient placenta showed abnormal phenotypes including small labyrinth and reduced vascular complexity, indicating that failure to establish mature circulatory pattern affects the embryonic development and results in early mortality. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Asb2 knockout mice have placental defects, that subsequently result in failure to form a normal cardiac septum, and thereby result in embryo mortality in utero at around E 9.5.

Abstract: Summary
Cells have evolved an elaborate DNA repair network to ensure complete and accurate DNA replication. Defects in these repair machineries can fuel genome instability and drive carcinogenesis while creating vulnerabilities that may be exploited in therapy. Here, we use nascent chromatin capture (NCC) proteomics to characterize the repair of replication-associated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) triggered by topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitors. We reveal profound changes in the fork proteome, including the chromatin environment and nuclear membrane interactions, and identify three classes of repair factors according to their enrichment at broken and/or stalled forks. ATM inhibition dramatically rewired the broken fork proteome, revealing that ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) signalling stimulates DNA end resection, recruits PLK1, and concomitantly suppresses the canonical DSB ubiquitination response by preventing accumulation of RNF168 and BRCA1-A. This work and collection of replication fork proteomes provide a new framework to understand how cells orchestrate homologous recombination repair of replication-associated DSBs.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical signals, such as those evoked by maximal-intensity contractions (MICs), can induce an increase in muscle mass. Rapamycin-sensitive signaling events are widely implicated in the regulation of this process; however, recent studies indicate that rapamycin-insensitive signaling events are also involved. Thus, to identify these events, we generate a map of the MIC-regulated and rapamycin-sensitive phosphoproteome. In total, we quantify more than 10,000 unique phosphorylation sites and find that more than 2,000 of these sites are significantly affected by MICs, but remarkably, only 38 of the MIC-regulated events are mediated through a rapamycin-sensitive mechanism. Further interrogation of the rapamycin-insensitive phosphorylation events identifies the S473 residue on Tripartite Motif-Containing 28 (TRIM28) as one of the most robust MIC-regulated phosphorylation sites, and extensive follow-up studies suggest that TRIM28 significantly contributes to the homeostatic regulation of muscle size and function as well as the hypertrophy that occurs in response to increased mechanical loading.

Abstract: Summary
Termination of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription in metazoans relies largely on the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) and integrator (INT) complexes originally found to act at the ends of protein-coding and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, respectively. Here, we monitor CPA- and INT-dependent termination activities genome-wide, including at thousands of previously unannotated transcription units (TUs), producing unstable RNA. We verify the global activity of CPA occurring at pA sites indiscriminately of their positioning relative to the TU promoter. We also identify a global activity of INT, which is largely sequence-independent and restricted to a ~3-kb promoter-proximal region. Our analyses suggest two functions of genome-wide INT activity: it dampens transcriptional output from weak promoters, and it provides quality control of RNAPII complexes that are unfavorably configured for transcriptional elongation. We suggest that the function of INT in stable snRNA production is an exception from its general cellular role, the attenuation of non-productive transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Alterations in gamma oscillations occur in several neurological disorders, and the entrainment of gamma oscillations has been recently proposed as a treatment for neurodegenerative disease. Optogenetic stimulation enhances recovery in models of stroke when applied weeks after injury; however, the benefits of acute brain stimulation have not been investigated. Here, we report beneficial effects of gamma-frequency modulation in the acute phase, within 1 h, after stroke. Transgenic VGAT-ChR2 mice are subject to awake photothrombotic stroke in an area encompassing the forelimb sensory and motor cortex. Optogenetic stimulation at 40 Hz in the peri-infarct zone recovers neuronal activity 24 h after stroke in motor and parietal association areas, as well as blood flow over the first week after stroke. Stimulation significantly reduces lesion volume and improves motor function. Our results suggest that acute-phase modulation of cortical oscillatory dynamics may serve as a target for neuroprotection against stroke.

Abstract: Summary
Implantation is a hallmark of mammalian embryogenesis during which embryos establish their contacts with the maternal endometrium, remodel, and undertake growth and differentiation. The mechanisms and sequence of events through which embryos change their shape during this transition are largely unexplored. Here, we show that the first extraembryonic lineage, the polar trophectoderm, is the key regulator for remodeling the embryonic epiblast. Loss of its function after immuno-surgery or inhibitor treatments prevents the epiblast shape transitions. In the mouse, the polar trophectoderm exerts physical force upon the epiblast, causing it to transform from an oval into a cup shape. In human embryos, the polar trophectoderm behaves in the opposite manner, exerting a stretching force. By mimicking this stretching behavior in mouse embryogenesis, we could direct the epiblast to adopt the disc-like shape characteristic of human embryos at this stage. Thus, the polar trophectoderm acts as a conserved regulator of epiblast shape.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor immune microenvironment plays a critical role in cancer progression and response to immunotherapy in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), yet the composition and phenotypic states of immune cells in this tumor are incompletely characterized. We performed single-cell RNA and T cell receptor sequencing on 164,722 individual cells from tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue in patients with ccRCC across disease stages: early, locally advanced, and advanced/metastatic. Terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells were enriched in metastatic disease and were restricted in T cell receptor diversity. Within the myeloid compartment, pro-inflammatory macrophages were decreased, and suppressive M2-like macrophages were increased in advanced disease. Terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells and M2-like macrophages co-occurred in advanced disease and expressed ligands and receptors that support T cell dysfunction and M2-like polarization. This immune dysfunction circuit is associated with a worse prognosis in external cohorts and identifies potentially targetable immune inhibitory pathways in ccRCC.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) or presenilin 2 (PSEN2), the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, cause familial Alzheimer’s disease (fAD). We hypothesized that mutations in PSEN1 reduce Notch signaling and alter neurogenesis. Expression data from developmental and adult neurogenesis show relative enrichment of Notch and γ-secretase expression in stem cells, whereas expression of APP and β-secretase is enriched in neurons. We observe premature neurogenesis in fAD iPSCs harboring PSEN1 mutations using two orthogonal systems: cortical differentiation in 2D and cerebral organoid generation in 3D. This is partly driven by reduced Notch signaling. We extend these studies to adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mutation-confirmed postmortem tissue. fAD cases show mutation-specific effects and a trend toward reduced abundance of newborn neurons, supporting a premature aging phenotype. Altogether, these results support altered neurogenesis as a result of fAD mutations and suggest that neural stem cell biology is affected in aging and disease.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate the effects of Semaphorin 4A (Sema4A) on the angiogenesis, migration and invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells.
Methods
Sema4A expression in OSCC patients was detected by Immunohistochemistry, and its relationship with clinicopathological features and prognosis of patients was analyzed. The mRNA and protein expression of Sema4A in primary human oral keratinocytes (HOKs) and OSCC cells (SCC-25, HSC-3, CAL-27) were determined by Western blotting and qRT-PCR. After HOKs, HSC-3 cells and SCC-25 cells transfected with Control/Sema4A CRISPR activation plasmid, the migration and invasion abilities were detected by Wound healing and Transwell invasion. Tube formation assay was also performed on endothelial cells and the contents of VEGF and bFGF were quantified using qRT-PCR and ELISA.
Results
Cytoplasmic Sema4A expression was related to T classification, clinical stage and nodal metastasis of OSCC patients. Patients with low cytoplasmic Sema4A expression showed the higher microvessel density (MVD) and the poorer prognosis in OSCC. Compared with HOK, OSCC cells (SCC-25, HSC-3, CAL-27) declined apparently in Sema4A expression, which was much more significant in metastatic HSC-3 and SCC-25 cells. After HOKs, HSC-3 cells and SCC-25 cells transfected with Sema4A over-expression plasmid, the invasion and migration abilities were decreased. Besides, overexpression of Sema4A could significantly inhibit the tube formation of HUVEC induced by OSCC cells with reductions of angiogenic factors (VEGF and bFGF).
Conclusion
Over-expression of Sema4A could restrict tumor progression through inhibiting the angiogenesis, invasion and migration of OSCC cells.

Abstract: Aging is a complex process that differentially impacts multiple cognitive, sensory, neuronal and molecular processes. Technological innovations now allow for parallel investigation of neuronal circuit function, structure and molecular composition in the brain of awake behaving adult mice. Thus, mice have become a critical tool to better understand how aging impacts the brain. However, a more granular systems-based approach, which considers the impact of age on key features relating to neural processing, is required. Here, we review evidence probing the impact of age on the mouse brain. We focus on a range of processes relating to neuronal function, including cognitive abilities, sensory systems, synaptic plasticity and calcium regulation. Across many systems, we find evidence for prominent age-related dysregulation even before 12 months of age, suggesting that emerging age-related alterations can manifest by late adulthood. However, we also find reports suggesting that some processes are remarkably resilient to aging. The evidence suggests that aging does not drive a parallel, linear dysregulation of all systems, but instead impacts some processes earlier, and more severely, than others. We propose that capturing the more fine-scale emerging features of age-related vulnerability and resilience may provide better opportunities for the rejuvenation of the aged brain.

Abstract: In this study, the combined effects of four-week swimming training and melatonin were examined on the oxidative response, inflammation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis capacity of cardiac tissue in the mouse model of diabetes. The mice were randomly allocated into five groups (n = 10 per group) as follows: Control; Diabetic group; Diabetic + Melatonin group; Diabetic + Exercise group; and Diabetic + Exercise + Melatonin group. 50 mg/kg streptozotocin was intraperitoneally administrated. In melatonin-treated groups, melatonin was injected intraperitoneally at 3 mg/kg body weight for four weeks and twice weekly. Swimming exercises were performed for four weeks. We measured cardiac superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase enzymes, malondialdehyde, and total antioxidant capacity. The expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, Caspase‑3, Sirtuin1, and Connexin-43 was measured using real-time PCR analysis. The vascular density was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using CD31 and α-smooth muscle actin antibodies. The combination of melatonin and exercise elevated cardiac superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase coincided with the reduction of malondialdehyde and increase of total antioxidant capacity as compared to the diabetic mice (p < 0.05). In Diabetic + Exercise + Melatonin mice, tumor necrosis factor-α, Caspase‑3 was significantly down-regulated compared to the Diabetic group (p < 0.05). Melatonin and exercise suppressed the expression of Connexin-43 and Sirtuin1 in diabetic mice in comparison with the control mice (p < 0.05). H & E staining showed necrosis and focal hyperemia reduction in the Diabetic + Exercise + Melatonin group compared to the Diabetic group. Data showed a decrease of CD31+ and α-smooth muscle actin+ vessels in the Diabetic group as compared to the normal samples (p < 0.05). The number of CD31+ vessels, but not α-smooth muscle actin+ type, increased in the Diabetic + Exercise + Melatonin group compared to the Diabetic mice. These data demonstrated that exercise along with melatonin administration could diminish the detrimental effects of diabetes on cardiac tissue via using different mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific consensus motifs within the local chromatin context. The mechanisms by which TFs navigate the nuclear environment as they search for binding sites remain unclear. Here, we used single-molecule tracking and machine-learning-based classification to directly measure the nuclear mobility of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in live cells. We revealed two distinct and dynamic low-mobility populations. One accounts for specific binding to chromatin, while the other represents a confinement state that requires an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), implicated in liquid-liquid condensate subdomains. Further analysis showed that the dwell times of both subpopulations follow a power-law distribution, consistent with a broad distribution of affinities on the GR cistrome and interactome. Together, our data link IDRs with a confinement state that is functionally distinct from specific chromatin binding and modulates the transcriptional output by increasing the local concentration of TFs at specific sites.

Abstract: Summary
The health effect of dietary fat has been one of the most vexing issues in the field of nutrition. Few animal studies have examined the impact of high-fat diets on lifespan by controlling energy intake. In this study, we found that compared to a normal diet, an isocaloric moderately high-fat diet (IHF) significantly prolonged lifespan by decreasing the profiles of free fatty acids (FFAs) in serum and multiple tissues via downregulating FFA anabolism and upregulating catabolism pathways in rats and flies. Proteomics analysis in rats identified PPRC1 as a key protein that was significantly upregulated by nearly 2-fold by IHF, and among the FFAs, only palmitic acid (PA) was robustly and negatively associated with the expression of PPRC1. Using PPRC1 transgenic RNAi/overexpression flies and in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that IHF significantly reduced PA, which could upregulate PPRC1 through PPARG, resulting in improvements in oxidative stress and inflammation and prolonging the lifespan.

Abstract: Summary
Several potent neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus have been identified. However, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has not been comprehensively studied for SARS-CoV-2, and the relationship between enhancing versus neutralizing activities and antibody epitopes remains unknown. Here, we select a convalescent individual with potent IgG neutralizing activity and characterize his antibody response. Monoclonal antibodies isolated from memory B cells target four groups of five non-overlapping receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes. Antibodies to one group of these RBD epitopes mediate ADE of entry in Raji cells via an Fcγ receptor-dependent mechanism. In contrast, antibodies targeting two other distinct epitope groups neutralize SARS-CoV-2 without ADE, while antibodies against the fourth epitope group are poorly neutralizing. One antibody, XG014, potently cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as SARS-CoV-1, with respective IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values as low as 5.1 and 23.7 ng/mL, while not exhibiting ADE. Therefore, neutralization and ADE of human SARS-CoV-2 antibodies correlate with non-overlapping RBD epitopes.

Abstract: Summary
The upper gastrointestinal tract, consisting of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, controls food transport, digestion, nutrient uptake, and hormone production. By single-cell analysis of healthy epithelia of these human organs, we molecularly define their distinct cell types. We identify a quiescent COL17A1high KRT15high stem/progenitor cell population in the most basal cell layer of the esophagus and detect substantial gene expression differences between identical cell types of the human and mouse stomach. Selective expression of BEST4, CFTR, guanylin, and uroguanylin identifies a rare duodenal cell type, referred to as BCHE cell, which likely mediates high-volume fluid secretion because of continual activation of the CFTR channel by guanylin/uroguanylin-mediated autocrine signaling. Serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells in the antral stomach significantly differ in gene expression from duodenal enterochromaffin cells. We, furthermore, discover that the histamine-producing enterochromaffin-like cells in the oxyntic stomach express the luteinizing hormone, yet another member of the enteroendocrine hormone family.

Abstract: Summary
Investigations of the human germline and programming are challenging because of limited access to embryonic material. However, the pig as a model may provide insights into transcriptional network and epigenetic reprogramming applicable to both species. Here we show that, during the pre- and early migratory stages, pig primordial germ cells (PGCs) initiate large-scale epigenomic reprogramming, including DNA demethylation involving TET-mediated hydroxylation and, potentially, base excision repair (BER). There is also macroH2A1 depletion and increased H3K27me3 as well as X chromosome reactivation (XCR) in females. Concomitantly, there is dampening of glycolytic metabolism genes and re-expression of some pluripotency genes like those in preimplantation embryos. We identified evolutionarily young transposable elements and gene coding regions resistant to DNA demethylation in acutely hypomethylated gonadal PGCs, with potential for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Detailed insights into the pig germline will likely contribute significantly to advances in human germline biology, including in vitro gametogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophage-mediated inflammation is critical in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Here, we describe that, with high-fat, high-sucrose-diet feeding, mature TIM4pos Kupffer cells (KCs) decrease in number, while monocyte-derived Tim4neg macrophages accumulate. In concert, monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages enter the liver and consist of a transitional subset that expresses Cx3cr1/Ccr2 and a second subset characterized by expression of Trem2, Cd63, Cd9, and Gpmnb; markers ascribed to lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs). The Cx3cr1/Ccr2-expressing macrophages, referred to as C-LAMs, localize to macrophage aggregates and hepatic crown-like structures (hCLSs) in the steatotic liver. In C-motif chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2)-deficient mice, C-LAMs fail to appear in the liver, and this prevents hCLS formation, reduces LAM numbers, and increases liver fibrosis. Taken together, our data reveal dynamic changes in liver macrophage subsets during the pathogenesis of NASH and link these shifts to pathologic tissue remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is mediated by break-induced replication (BIR), but how BIR is regulated at telomeres is poorly understood. Here, we show that telomeric BIR is a self-perpetuating process. By tethering PML-IV to telomeres, we induced telomere clustering in ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) and a POLD3-dependent ATR response at telomeres, showing that BIR generates replication stress. Ablation of BLM helicase activity in APBs abolishes telomere synthesis but causes multiple chromosome bridges between telomeres, revealing a function of BLM in processing inter-telomere BIR intermediates. Interestingly, the accumulation of BLM in APBs requires its own helicase activity and POLD3, suggesting that BIR triggers a feedforward loop to further recruit BLM. Enhancing BIR induces PIAS4-mediated TRF2 SUMOylation, and PIAS4 loss deprives APBs of repair proteins and compromises ALT telomere synthesis. Thus, a BLM-driven and PIAS4-mediated feedforward loop operates in APBs to perpetuate BIR, providing a critical mechanism to extend ALT telomeres.

Abstract: Summary
Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs)/family B2 GPCRs execute critical tasks during development and the operation of organs, and their genetic lesions are associated with human disorders, including cancers. Exceptional structural aGPCR features are the presence of a tethered agonist (TA) concealed within a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain and their non-covalent heteromeric two-subunit layout. How the TA is poised for activation while maintaining this delicate receptor architecture is central to conflicting signaling paradigms that either involve or exclude aGPCR heterodimer separation. We investigated this matter in five mammalian aGPCR homologs (ADGRB3, ADGRE2, ADGRE5, ADGRG1, and ADGRL1) and demonstrate that intact aGPCR heterodimers exist at the cell surface, that the core TA region becomes unmasked in the cleaved GAIN domain, and that intra-GAIN domain movements regulate the level of tethered agonist exposure, thereby likely controlling aGPCR activity. Collectively, these findings delineate a unifying mechanism for TA-dependent signaling of intact aGPCRs.
