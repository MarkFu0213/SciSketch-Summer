Abstract: Temperature-induced copper diffusion process and its influences on optical degradation and long-term stability of solar absorber coatings on copper substrates were investigated at intermediate temperatures of 248–500°C. The studied absorbers were sputtered chromium oxy-nitride absorbers having tin oxide anti-reflection coatings. The absorbers were aged by means of thermal accelerated ageing studies and short-period heat treatments up to 500°C for two hours. Ageing mechanisms and degradation of the absorbers were analysed before and after the ageing studies by optical measurements (solar absorptance with a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer and thermal emittance by FTIR spectrophotometry), microstructural analysis using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an EDS, composition by time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF-ERDA) and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), and adhesion by tensile test. The relation between optical degradation and diffusion mechanisms was studied using optical modelling and simulation. The results clearly revealed the mechanism of outward copper diffusion: diffusion of copper substrate atoms into the coating and through the coating to the surface, formation of copper oxide islands on the surface of the coating, and formation of voids in the substrate surface. The relation between the diffusion mechanisms and increase in thermal emittance of the absorber surface was demonstrated.

Abstract: The nanostructured TiO2 materials impregnated with Cu were prepared via a simple and eco-friendly preparation route. The materials are comprised of nano -tubes, -rods and -particles whose surfaces are modified by a fine dispersion of CuxO clusters (Cuo and Cu2O) as evidenced by TEM and XPS analysis. Structural and optical characterization ascertained the biphasic (anatase-rutile) crystal structure of TiO2 nano-objects. The presence of CuxO at the surface extends the absorption from the UV to the visible light range. In contrast to the pristine and calcined TiO2 nanotubes (TNT), the CuxO/TiO2 nanostructures (Cu1.5TNT) exhibit a prolonged life-time of photogenerated charge carriers and decreased surface area as confirmed by the photoluminescence spectra and surface area analysis, respectively. The prepared photocatalysts were tested for hydrogen (H2) production activity using water, mono and di-hydroxylic alcohols solutions under solar light irradiation. Surprisingly, Cu-modified TiO2 nanostructures (Cu1.5TNT) have shown an unusually high rate of H2 production of about 114.9±2mmolh−1g−1cat under a set of optimized experimental conditions. Among all of the studied photocatalysts, the Cu1.5TNT catalyst exhibits enhancements of 33 and 18 fold in the H2 production rate as compared to the commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (TNP) and calcined TNT, respectively. We report here on the highest known rate of H2 production using the nanostructured Cu-doped TiO2 photocatalyst (Cu1.5TNT) under solar light irradiation. This unprecedented H2 production is attributed to synergistic effects of nanocrystalline structures, morphology and copper oxide species (Cuo and Cu2O) present in the photocatalyst.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a significant health problem due to the involvement of multiple aberrant and redundant signaling pathways in tumorigenesis and the development of resistance to the existing therapeutic agents. Therefore, the search for novel chemotherapeutic agents for effective management of breast cancer is still warranted. In an effort to develop new anti-breast cancer agents, we have synthesized and identified novel spiro-oxindole derivative G613 i.e. 5-chloro-4′,5′-diphenyl-3′-(4-(2-(piperidin-1-yl) ethoxy) benzoyl) spiro[indoline-3,2′-pyrrolidin]-2-one, which has shown growth inhibitory activity in breast cancer cells. The present study was aimed to explore the mechanism of anti-tumorigenic action of this newly identified spiro-oxindole compound. Compound G613 inhibited the Mdm2–p53 interaction in breast cancer cells and tumor xenograft. It caused restoration of p53 function by activating its promoter activity, triggering its nuclear accumulation and preventing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Supportively, molecular docking studies revealed considerable homology in the docking mode of G613 and the known Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3, to p53 binding pocket of Mdm2. The activation of p53 led to upregulation of p53 dependent pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax, Pumaα and Noxa and enhanced interaction of p53 with bcl2 member proteins thus triggering both transcription-dependent and transcription-independent apoptosis, respectively. Additionally, the compound decreased estrogen receptor activity through sequestration of estrogen receptor α by p53 thereby causing a decreased transcriptional activation and expression of proliferation markers. In conclusion, G613 represents a potent small-molecule inhibitor of the Mdm2–p53 interaction and can serve as a promising lead for developing a new class of anti-cancer therapy for breast cancer patients.

Abstract: The optical and photovoltaic properties of Si NCs/SiC multilayers (MLs) are investigated using a membrane-based solar cell structure. By removing the Si substrate in the active cell area, the MLs are studied without any bulk Si substrate contribution. The occurrence is confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and light-beam induced current mapping. Optical characterization combined with simulations allows us to determine the absorption within the ML absorber layer, isolated from the other cell stack layers. The results indicate that the absorption at wavelengths longer than 800nm is only due to the SiC matrix. The measured short-circuit current is significantly lower than that theoretically obtained from absorption within the ML absorber, which is ascribed to losses that limit carrier extraction. The origin of these losses is discussed in terms of the material regions where recombination takes place. Our results indicate that carrier extraction is most efficient from the Si NCs themselves, whereas recombination is strongest in SiC and residual a-Si domains. Together with the observed onset of the external quantum efficiency at 700–800nm, this fact is an evidence of quantum confinement in Si NCs embedded in SiC on device level.

Abstract: The correlation between the As to group III flux ratio and photovoltaic performance of GaIn0.1N0.03As solar cells fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy is systematically investigated. The results show that flux ratio has a remarkable influence on the formation of defect traps. Furthermore, the formation of defects at different flux ratios is correlating with the variation of the background doping level and the photovoltaic performance. In particular, this study reveals a linear dependency between current generation, dark saturation current, defect densities, photoluminescence peak intensity and the flux ratio. A significant increase in solar cell performance, exhibiting maximum external quantum efficiency of 90%, is obtained when As/group-III ratio is decreased close to the stoichiometric limit. For optimized growth condition, the 1eV GaIn0.1N0.03As solar cell exhibits a short circuit current density as high as 17.9mA/cm2 calculated from the external quantum efficiency data (AM0 conditions) with 870nm high-pass filter. This value reflects the potential of the GaInNAs cell for current matching and power generation in high efficiency solar cells incorporating three- or four- junctions.

Abstract: Objective/background
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a group of monoclonal hematopoietic diseases consisting of a number of various entities. The presence of differences in chromosomal content of cells within the same individual is known as chromosomal mosaicism. The impact of mosaic pattern on the prognosis of MDS has been unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the impact of mosaic pattern on the survival of patients with MDS.
Methods
We retrospectively evaluated 119 patients diagnosed with MDS at the Trakya University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology. Giemsa–Trypsin–Giemsa banding was used to evaluate chromosomal abnormality. The effect of chromosomal abnormality mosaicism on overall survival and transformation to acute leukemia was evaluated by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis.
Results
The mean age at diagnosis was 66.3years, and the mean disease duration was 24.2months. Chromosomal abnormality was observed in 32.5% of patients. Patients with chromosomal abnormalities comprising at least 50% metaphases had significantly lower overall survival than patients with abnormality comprising up to 50% of all abnormal metaphases (p=.003). There were no differences in transformation to acute leukemia among patients with higher and lower chromosomal mosaicism (p=.056).
Conclusion
The most important outcome of this study was to demonstrate worse overall survival rates in MDS patients with higher abnormal chromosomal mosaicism than patients with lesser abnormal chromosomal mosaicism. Higher levels of abnormal chromosomal mosaicism did not predict transformation to acute leukemia. The cause of worse outcomes of patients with higher abnormal chromosomal mosaicism may be related to clonal mass.

Abstract: The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases are associated to various processes such as cell cycle control and diverse developmental pathways. Arabidopsis thaliana SEVEN IN ABSENTIA like 7, which has ubiquitin ligase activity, is located in the nucleus and cytosol and is expressed at several stages in almost all plant tissues suggesting an important role in plant functions. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of this protein is unknown. Since we found that the SEVEN IN ABSENTIA like 7 gene expression is altered in plants with impaired mitochondria, and in plants deficient in the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1, we decided to study the possible interactions between both proteins as potential partners in plant signaling functions. We found that SEVEN IN ABSENTIA like 7 is able to interact in vitro with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and that the Lys231 residue of the last is essential for this function. Following the interaction, a concomitant increase in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalytic activity was observed. However, when SEVEN IN ABSENTIA like 7 was supplemented with E1 and E2 proteins to form a complete E1–E2–E3 modifier complex, we observed the mono-ubiquitination of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 at the Lys76 residue and a dramatic decrease of its catalytic activity. Moreover, we found that localization of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 in the nucleus is dependent on the expression SEVEN IN ABSENTIA like 7. These observations suggest that the association of both proteins might result in different biological consequences in plants either through affecting the glycolytic flux or via cytoplasm-nucleus relocation.

Abstract: Electroluminescence imaging combined with photoluminescence imaging on solar cells allows extracting spatially resolved information on local solar cell quality. Numerous methods for the extraction of spatially resolved parameters have been introduced in the past. An important factor, which has mandatory influence on electroluminescence images, has not been discussed in detail yet. This factor is the influence of the external contacting scheme or erroneous contacting on the measurement results. In this work we discuss the influence of the external contacting scheme on the appearance of electroluminescence images and images of the spatially resolved series resistance which are calculated from electroluminescence images taken at different operating points. Furthermore we discuss the impact of erroneous contacting on fill factor measurements. We show that the impact of erroneous contacting on fill factor measurements becomes larger if busbar resistances become larger. The industrial trend towards thinner busbars with higher resistances hence motivates an electroluminescence based quality control for inline current voltage measurements of silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Organic phase change materials (PCMs) have been mixed with suitable building materials and the resulting form stable-composite PCMs (FS-CPCMs) have been used for low temperature-thermal energy storage (TES) applications for passive solar heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) purposes in building envelopes. Here, three novel types of FS-CPCMs were prepared as TES materials for building applications by absorption of capric (CA)–palmitic acid (PA) eutectic mixture, heptadecane (HEPD) and dodecanol (DD) as different kinds of organic PCMs into pumice (PUM) via vacuum impregnation. The maximum mass percentages of CA–PA, HEPD and DD into FS-CPCMs were determined as 34wt%, 32wt%, and 31wt%, respectively. The chemical, morphological and thermal characterizations of the developed FS-CPCMs were performed by SEM, FT-IR, DSC, and TG analysis techniques. SEM and FT-IR results showed that the selected organic PCMs were well incorporated into the pores of the PUM particles and have good compatibility among the components of the composites. DSC analysis indicated that the phase change temperatures and TES capacities of the fabricated FS-CPCMs were in the range of 20.98–23.27°C and 55.40–72.38J/g, respectively. TG analysis results revealed that the prepared FS-CPCMs are thermally stable. The thermal cycling test also showed that they have excellent structural stability and good stability for TES characteristics after 3000 cycles. The FS-CPCMs were tested in the form of plasters firstly in this study, which is similar to large-scale building applications. Thermal performance tests showed that the gypsum plasters with the FS-CPCMs can be improved the thermal comfort keeping the indoor temperature at the comfortable range for a long time and reduced the energy consumption. Based on all results, it can be deduced that the newly developed PUM/CA–PA, PUM/HEPD and PUM/DD are potential FS-CPCMs for low temperature-HVAC applications in the construction of energy-efficient buildings.

Abstract: We report formation of Cu2O thin-films through successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process. We have fully characterized the thin-films grown in atmospheric condition with a non-vacuum process. Post-deposition annealing in oxygen environment has led to formation of CuO thin-films. We have formed pn-junctions with a layer of the p-type copper oxides and another layer of n-type SnO2 nanoparticles. Such pn-junctions, along with other oxide semiconductors as carrier blocking layers acted as all-oxide thin-film solar cells which were formed in an atmospheric condition. We report the effect of NiO as a hole-transporting and electron-blocking layer and ZnO as a buffer layer between p- and n-layers to forbid chemical changes occurring at the interface. From scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements we could locate band-edges of the materials with respect to their Fermi energy. The NiO/Cu2O/ZnO/SnO2 heterojunction devices having a staircase-like energy level led to facile transport of electrons and holes to the opposite electrodes and thereby acting as all-oxide thin-film solar cells yielding an energy conversion efficiency in excess to 1%.

The incoming solar radiation is firstly collected and focused by the system. An ellipsoid-shaped fused silica concentrator is then used to further compress the concentrated solar radiation into the grooved rod within a 2V-shaped pumping cavity. 4.5W continuous-wave TEM00-mode (M2≤1.1) 1064nm solar laser power is finally measured, attaining 2.36% laser slope efficiency, which is 3.37 and 2.91 times higher than previous records by Fresnel lens and parabolic mirror respectively. Record-high TEM00-mode solar laser collection efficiency of 4.0W/m2 is also achieved.

Abstract: Mitochondrial dysfunction is known as one of causative factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD), inducing neuronal cell death. Mitochondria regulate their functions through changing their morphology. The present work was undertaken to investigate whether Amyloid β (Aβ) affects mitochondrial morphology in neuronal cells to induce apoptosis. Aβ treatment induced not only the fragmentation of mitochondria but also neuronal apoptosis in association with an increase in caspase-9 and -3 activity. Calcium influx induced by Aβ up-regulated the activation of Akt through CaMKII resulting in changes to the phosphorylation level of Drp1 in a time-dependent manner. Translocation of Drp1 from the cytosol to mitochondria was blocked by CB-124005 (an Akt inhibitor). Recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria led to ROS generation and mitochondrial fission, accompanied by dysfunction of mitochondria such as loss of membrane potential and ATP production. ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction by Aβ were attenuated when treated with Mdivi-1, a selective Drp1 inhibitor. Furthermore, the sustained Akt activation induced not only the fragmentation of mitochondria but also the activation of mTOR, eventually suppressing autophagy. Inhibition of autophagic clearance of Aβ led to increased ROS levels and aggravating mitochondrial defects, which were blocked by Rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor). In conclusion, sustained phosphorylation of Akt by Aβ directly activates Drp1 and inhibits autophagy through the mTOR pathway. Together, these changes elicit abundant mitochondrial fragmentation resulting in ROS-mediated neuronal apoptosis.

Abstract: Hyperhomocysteinemia reduces neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain. Homocysteine (Hcy) inhibits postnatal neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation by specifically impairing the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-Erk1/2-cyclin E signaling pathway. We demonstrate herein that the inhibition of FGFR-dependent NPC proliferation induced by Hcy is mediated by its capacity to alter the cellular methylation potential. Our results show that this alteration modified the expression pattern and activity of Sprouty2 (Spry2), a negative regulator of the above mentioned pathway. Both elevated concentrations of Hcy and methyltransferase activity inhibition induced Spry2 promoter demethylation in NPC cultures leading to a sustained upregulation of the expression of Spry2 mRNA and protein. In addition, protein levels of two kinases responsible for Spry2 activation/deactivation were altered by Hcy: Spry2 kinase Dyrk1A levels diminished while Spry2 phosphatase PP2A increased, leading to changes in the phosphorylation pattern, activity and stability of Spry2. In conclusion, Hcy inhibits NPC proliferation by indirect mechanisms involving alterations in DNA methylation, gene expression, and Spry2 function, causing FGFR signaling impairment.,

Abstract: PI3K proteins family have multiple and essential functions in most cellular events. This family is composed of class I, class II and class III PI3Ks, which upstream and downstream elements are not completely elucidated. Previous studies using the broad PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 allowed to propose that PI3 kinase>Akt pathway is a key element in the determination of axonal polarity in hippocampal neurons. Recently, new inhibitors with a higher selectivity for class I PI3K have been characterized. In the present study we have examined this widely accepted theory using a new class I PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941), as well as Akt inhibitors, and PTEN phosphatase constructs to reduce PIP3 levels. Our present data show that both, class I PI3K inhibitor and Akt inhibitor did not alter axon specification in hippocampal neurons, but greatly reduced axon length. However, in the same experiments LY294002 effectively impeded axonal polarization, as previously reported. Our biochemical data show that both, class I PI3K and Akt inhibitors, effectively block downstream elements from Akt to S6K1 activity. Both inhibitors are stable in culture medium along the time period analysed, maintaining the inhibition better than LY294002. Besides, we found evidence that LY294002 directly inhibits mTORC1. However, further analysis using an mTORC1 inhibitor showed no change in neuron polarity. Same result was obtained using a general class III PI3K inhibitor. Interestingly, we found that either, wild-type PTEN, or a phosphatase-dead form of PTEN, disrupted axonal polarization, strongly suggesting that the role of PTEN in axonal polarity can be independent of PIP3.

Abstract: Cathepsin B (CTSB) is a lysosomal endo- and exopeptidase that is also secreted in high amounts by malignant and non-malignant cells. We determined the effect of CTSB on the tumor cell secretome by shRNA-mediated silencing of CTSB mRNA expression and subsequent proteomic LC-MS/MS analysis of the cell supernatants. We identified significant protein changes of 17 secreted or shed proteins. Notably, we found a general reduction in protein abundance of ADAM10 substrates and lysosomal proteins. We corroborated reduced amounts of soluble ADAM10 (sADAM10) and soluble APP (sAPP) in the two cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and U2OS by immunoblotting. Interestingly, reductions in sADAM10 and sAPP could be reversed by re-introducing a catalytically inactive variant of CTSB, suggesting a formerly unknown non-catalytic function of the protease.

Abstract: QUIN is a glutamate agonist playing a role in the misregulation of the cytoskeleton, which is associated with neurodegeneration in rats. In this study, we focused on microglial activation, FGF2/Erk signaling, gap junctions (GJs), inflammatory parameters and redox imbalance acting on cytoskeletal dynamics of the in QUIN-treated neural cells of rat striatum. FGF-2/Erk signaling was not altered in QUIN-treated primary astrocytes or neurons, however cytoskeleton was disrupted. In co-cultured astrocytes and neurons, QUIN-activated FGF2/Erk signaling prevented the cytoskeleton from remodeling. In mixed cultures (astrocyte, neuron, microglia), QUIN-induced FGF-2 increased level failed to activate Erk and promoted cytoskeletal destabilization. The effects of QUIN in mixed cultures involved redox imbalance upstream of Erk activation. Decreased connexin 43 (Cx43) immunocontent and functional GJs, was also coincident with disruption of the cytoskeleton in primary astrocytes and mixed cultures. We postulate that in interacting astrocytes and neurons the cytoskeleton is preserved against the insult of QUIN by activation of FGF-2/Erk signaling and proper cell-cell interaction through GJs. In mixed cultures, the FGF-2/Erk signaling is blocked by the redox imbalance associated with microglial activation and disturbed cell communication, disrupting the cytoskeleton. Thus, QUIN signal activates differential mechanisms that could stabilize or destabilize the cytoskeleton of striatal astrocytes and neurons in culture, and glial cells play a pivotal role in these responses preserving or disrupting a combination of signaling pathways and cell-cell interactions. Taken together, our findings shed light into the complex role of the active interaction of astrocytes, neurons and microglia in the neurotoxicity of QUIN.

Abstract: A novel experimental method is presented to determine the optical efficiency and the loss channels of a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC). Despite strong promise, LSCs have not yet reached their full potential due to various mechanisms affecting the device's optical efficiency. Among those loss channels, escape cone and non-unity quantum yield losses are generally the most dominant. To further advance the field of LSCs, it is vital to understand the impact of each independently. So far, researchers have only characterized the total loss in LSCs. Here, an experimental method is proposed to separate the contribution from each individual loss channel. The experimental apparatus is the same as used for quantum yield measurements of fluorophores in solid samples. Therefore, the setup is commonly available to research groups already involved in LSC research. The accuracy of this method is demonstrated by comparing the experimental results with Monte-Carlo ray tracing. Our experimental method can have a strong impact on LSC research as it offers a means to unveil the loss channels of LSCs in addition to the optical efficiency.

Abstract: Hemophilia A is an X-linked rescessive bleeding disorder that results from F8 gene aberrations. Previously, we established embryonic stem (ES) cells (tet-226aa/N6-Ainv18) that secrete human factor VIII (hFVIII) by introducing the human F8 gene in mouse Ainv18 ES cells. Here, we explored the potential of cell transplantation therapy for hemophilia A using the ES cells. Transplant tet-226aa/N6-Ainv18 ES cells were injected into the spleens of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-pretreated wild-type mice, and CCl4-pretreated hemophilia A mice. F8 expression was induced by doxycycline in drinking water, and hFVIII-antigen production was assessed in all cell transplantation experiments. Injecting the ES cells into SCID mice resulted in an enhanced expression of the hFVIII antigen; however, teratoma generation was confirmed in the spleen. Transplantation of ES cells into wild-type mice after CCl4-induced liver injury facilitated survival and engraftment of transplanted cells without teratoma formation, resulting in hFVIII production in the plasma. Although CCl4 was lethal to most hemophilia A mice, therapeutic levels of FVIII activity, as well as the hFVIII antigen, were detected in surviving hemophilia A mice after cell transplantation. Immunolocalization results for hFVIII suggested that transplanted ES cells might be engrafted at the periportal area in the liver. Although the development of a safer induction method for liver regeneration is required, our results suggested the potential for developing an effective ES-cell transplantation therapeutic model for treating hemophilia A in the future.

Abstract: By taking advantage of spectrally broad resonances, nanocavity-enhanced a-Ge:H solar cells with an absorber layer thickness below 20nm can reach current densities similar to micron-thick µc-Si:H devices. However, as nanocavity-enhanced devices are highly reliant on interference effects, further spectrally narrow resonance patterns are generated if an additional top cell is added to form a multijunction solar cell. This may complicate the integration of a-Ge:H nanocavity solar cells in tandem devices. We show that conventionally textured TCO substrates can be employed to suppress the top cell induced interferences, while the required broadband resonance of the a-Ge:H bottom cell nanocavity is maintained. This approach is realized in an a-Si:H/a-Ge:H tandem solar cell with an only 20nm thick a-Ge:H bottom cell absorber. The spectrally broad quantum efficiency curve of the bottom cell corresponds to a photocurrent density of 12.3mAcm−2, which is comparable to values reached in micromorph devices.

Abstract: We assess the environmental impact of a dynamic, adaptive, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. Such systems combine the benefits of adaptive shading with facade integrated solar tracking, thus reducing the building energy demand, and simultaneously generating electricity on-site. The inventory for the life cycle assessment (LCA) was acquired using production data, and Energy Plus simulations to calculate the building energy demand. The impact assessment was conducted according to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards using the Eco-invent database and openLCA as an analysis tool. The embodied environmental impact of the dynamic BIPV solution is higher than a static alternative due to the added control system, electronics, actuators, and additional supporting structure, resulting in higher life cycle impacts. However when accounting for the systems multi-functionality aspect, i.e. savings through adaptive shading to the building׳s heating, cooling and lighting loads, the embodied environmental impact can be offset, making the ASF an interesting alternative for BIPV. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate modifications to the actuator type, control system, and location and find that none of the investigated parameters overturn the key findings. The analysis ultimately enables us to provide design recommendations for future dynamic BIPV installations.

Abstract: Recent numerical modeling of plasmonic metallic nanostructures have shown great potential as a method of light management in thin-film nanodisc-patterned hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar photovoltaic (PV) cells. A significant design challenge for such plasmonic-enhanced PV devices is the requirement for ultra-thin transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) with high transmittance (low loss) and low enough resistivity to be used as device top contacts/electrodes. Most work on TCOs is on relatively thick layers and the few reported cases of thin TCO showed a marked decrease in conductivity. Recent work on ultra-thin TCOs of aluminum-doped zinc oxide, indium-doped tin oxide and zinc oxide revealed an unavoidable trade-off between transmittance and resistivity when fabricated with conventional growth methods. Ultra-thin films showed a tendency to be either amorphous and continuous or form as isolated islands. This results in poor electrical properties, which cannot be improved with annealing as the delicate thin films nucleate to form grain clusters. In order to overcome this challenge, this study investigates a novel method of producing ultra-thin (<40nm) high quality TCOs. First, ~80nm ITO films are sputtered in various argon–oxygen atmospheres and annealed to increase conductivity. The most promising materials were then reduced in thickness with a controlled low-cost room-temperature cyclic wet chemical etching process to reach the desired thickness. The degradation in the electrical conductivity was tracked as a function of thickness. The sheet resistance of 36nm thin films was observed to be of the same order compared to the much thicker commercial ITO films currently used as transparent electrodes in PV and other opto-electronic devices. Experimental optical properties of the shaved films were then used in an optimized model of nano-disc plasmonic a-Si:H solar cells. Simulations indicate that optical enhancement greater than 21% are possible in the 300–730nm wavelength range, when compared to the reference cell. Using the novel chemical shaving method described here, high-quality ultra-thin ITO films capable of improving the efficiency of thin film a-Si:H solar cells have been demonstrated. The methods employed in the optimization process are well established and economically viable, which provide the technical potential for commercialization of plasmonic based solar cells.

Abstract: Doping transition metals into 1-D nanostructures is of crucial importance for their application in photovoltaics and photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems; performance enhancements arise from both dopant incorporation and the 1-D nanostructures. Both in-situ and ex-situ doping methods have been demonstrated for 1-D hematite (α-Fe2O3) nanostructures, with tin (Sn) as the dopant, for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. In-situ Sn-doped hematite photoanodes adopted a morphology consisting of nanocorals with the (104) plane as the preferred direction of crystal growth. As an alternative solution, ex-situ doping not only preserves the vertically-aligned nanorod morphology but also sustains the preferred orientation of the (110) axis, which is favorable for high conductivity in pristine hematite photoanodes. In-situ Sn-doping was carried out by the same method: Sn precursors were added and dissolved in ethanol during the hydrothermal synthesis. Ex-situ doping was carried out in two stages (during pre-deposition and during high temperature sintering). During pre-deposition, a defined amount of the Sn precursor was introduced near the surface region of the 1-D nanostructure, and the Sn content was controlled by changing the concentration of the precursor solution. In subsequent high temperature sintering (800°C), the dopant atoms diffused into the hematite lattice to attain the desired doping proﬁle. We found that ex-situ Sn-doping resulted in a 60% increase in the photocurrent while in-situ Sn-doping yielded an increase of only 20% in the photocurrent, as compared with pristine hematite photoanodes, at 1.4 V vs. RHE. The improvement in the photocurrent was caused by a combination of Sn dopants in the hematite, which act as electron donors by increasing the donor density, and better surface charge transfer kinetics, thereby enhancing the overall device performance.

Abstract: Improved performance in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) can be achieved through multiple mechanisms by tuning the structure of the components and design architecture. Therefore, in this study, we designed and fabricated an electrostatically assembled contact interfacial layer utilizing the electrostatic interactions between positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and negatively charged sulfonate ions in a polymer, i.e. toluene sulfonic acid incorporated self-doped polyaniline (SPAN(TSA−)) (designated as SPAN(TSA−)/EA−CIL). We investigated the influence of SPAN(TSA−)/EA−CIL on the photovoltaic performance of BHJ PSCs. We adopted a simple “dip-dry” technique to fabricate the SPAN(TSA−)/EA−CIL. Cyclic Voltammetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, water contact angle measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy were employed to characterize the new SPAN(TSA−)/EA−CIL and to elucidate the associated enhancements in the photovoltaic performance. The fabricated PSCs with the SPAN(TSA−)/EA-CILs exhibited an improved photoconversion efficiency (PCE) through enhancement of both the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor compared to the device consisting of only SPAN(TSA−) or PEDOT:PSS. A plausible mechanism is presented here that explains the enhanced JSC and PCE in terms of transient dipole induction at the SPAN(TSA−)/EA-CIL surface. Interestingly, the PCE of devices based on ITO/SPAN(TSA−)/EA-CIL(1:1)/P3HT:PC60BM/Al and ITO/SPAN(TSA−)/EA-CIL(1:1)/PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM/Al was enhanced by 13% (3.19–3.67%) and 10% (5.11–5.60%) compared to those of devices based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC60BM/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM/Al, respectively. The present work thus identifies a novel class of low-temperature processable interface layer with a potential to fabricate highly efficient photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: In this study, we systematically investigated the performance loss factors in Cu(InGa)(SSe)2 (CIGSSe) solar cells with various Cu/(Ga+In) (CGI) ratios, which were fabricated with sputtering and sequential selenization/sulfurization processes. The effects of the CGI ratio on the CIGSSe solar cells were determined by measuring the current–voltage (IV) curves and junction capacitance of the solar cells, as well as by performing X-ray analysis techniques on the cells. An increase in the defect density and decrease in the free carrier density were observed in samples with high Cu concentrations (CGI ratio >0.89), which resulted in a drastic decrease in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). The temperature-dependent IV (IVT) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of the bulk characterization corresponded well with the capacitance measurements for all CGI ratios. The low crystal quality and short minority-carrier diffusion length at high CGI ratios resulted in a significant bulk recombination rate. A qualitative analysis of the interface characteristics was performed with IVT measurements, and the results showed that the recombination activation energy in the samples with high CGI ratios was lower than the bandgap (Eg), decreasing the VOC of these devices. For the samples with high CGI ratios, their inferior bulk and interface characteristics caused recombination to occur at the interface as well as in the bulk. However, the interface recombination rate was negligible for the samples with low CGI ratios (CGI ratio <0.89). In addition, a CIGSSe solar module was fabricated on a mass production assembly line, with the size of the CIGSSe solar module the same as that of commercially available crystalline-Si-based solar modules. The record efficiency of a solar module with a total area of is 16.0%.

Abstract: A vapour-phase reaction process has been used to deposit smooth and uniform CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite material to enable the measurement of its optical dispersion relations, n and k, by ellipsometry. Fitting was achieved with a combination of Tauc–Lorenz, critical point parabolic band (CPPB) and harmonic oscillators. We have used the dispersion relations in an all-optical model of new planar device architectures in order to establish design rules for future materials choices to maximize the short-circuit current (Jsc) performance. For 500nm of MAPI with no window layer, the maximum performance expected from the model is Jsc=21.63mAcm−2. The ability of thin layers (in the range 20–60nm) of a range of window layer materials (TiO2, WO3, ZnO, Nb2O5, CdS, and Cd0.4 Zn0.6S) to enhance the short-circuit current of the devices was investigated. The performance of the oxides showed interference behaviour, with the first maxima in their Jsc curves exceeding the value achievable without a window layer. However, after the first maximum, the performance generally fell off with increasing thickness. The only material to stay greater than the no-window condition for the entire investigated range is WO3. The highest performance (Jsc of 22.47mAcm−2) was obtained with 59nm of WO3, with that of TiO2, ZnO, and Nb2O5 being marginally lower. Parasitic absorption in CdS window layers caused the Jsc to decrease for all non-zero thicknesses – it gives no interference enhancement and its use cannot be recommended on optical grounds. Use of the wider gap alloy Cd0.4Zn0.6S gave higher currents than did CdS but its performance was not so high as for the oxides. Observations are made on the practicalities of fabricating the target structures in the fabrication of practical PV devices.

Abstract: Background
Hailey–Hailey disease (HHD), also known as familial benign chronic pemphigus, is a rare, chronic and recurrent blistering disorder, histologically characterized by suprabasal acantholysis. HHD has been linked to mutations in ATP2C1, the gene encoding the human adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-powered calcium channel pump.
Methods
In this work, the genetically tractable yeast Kluyveromyces lactis has been used to study the molecular basis of Hailey-Hailey disease. The K. lactis strain depleted of PMR1, the orthologue of the human ATP2C1 gene, was used to screen a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cDNA library to identify genetic interactors able to suppress the oxidative stress occurring in those cells.
Results
We have identified the Glutathione S-transferase ϴ-subunit (GST), an important detoxifying enzyme, which restores many of the defects associated with the pmr1Δmutant. GST overexpression in those cells suppressed the sensitivity to calcium chelating agents and partially re-established calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis by decreasing the high cytosolic Ca2+ levels in pmr1Δstrain. Moreover, we found that in the K. lactis mutant the mitochondrial dysfunction was suppressed by GST overexpression independently from calcineurin. In agreement with yeast results, a decreased expression of the human GST counterpart (GSTT1/M1) was observed in lesion-derived keratinocytes from HHD patients.
Conclusions
These data highlighted the Glutathione S-transferase as a candidate gene associated with Hailey-Hailey disease.
General significance
Kluyveromyces lactis can be considered a good model to study the molecular basis of this pathology.

Abstract: The Yersinia outer protein J (YopJ) plays a pivotal role in evading the host immune response and establishes a persistent infection in host cells after bacterial infection. YopJ is a cysteine protease and can act as a deubiquitinating enzyme that deubiquitinates several targets in multiple signaling pathways. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a critical adapter for the induction of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and subsequent production of the cytokines in response to nucleic acids in the cytoplasm. Our studies demonstrate that YopJ targets STING to inhibit IRF3 signaling. Specially, YopJ interacts with STING to block its ER-to-Golgi traffic and remove its K63-linked ubiquitination chains. Deubiquited STING perturbs the formation of STING-TBK1 complex and the activation of IRF3. The 172th cysteine of YopJ mediated STING deubiquitination and IRF3 signaling inhibition. Consequently, mice infected with WT and ΔYopJ/YopJ bacteria induced lower levels of IRF3 and IFN-β, decreased inflammation and reduced staining of STING as compared to ΔYopJ and ΔYopJ/YopJ C172A strains infection. The data herein reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which YopJ modulates innate immune signaling.

Abstract: By mediating proteolytic shedding on the cell surface the disintegrin and metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17 function as critical regulators of growth factors, cytokines and adhesion molecules. We here report that stimulation of lung epithelial A549 tumor cells with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) leads to the downregulation of the surface expressed mature form of ADAM17 without affecting ADAM10 expression. This reduction could not be sufficiently explained by metalloproteinase-mediated degradation, dynamin-mediated internalization or microdomain redistribution of ADAM17. Instead, surface downregulation of ADAM17 was correlated with the presence of its mature form in exosomes. Exosomal ADAM17 release was also observed in monocytic and primary endothelial cells where it could be induced by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Antibody-mediated surface labelling of ADAM17 revealed that at least part of exosomal ADAM17 was oriented with the metalloproteinase domain outside and had been expressed on the cell surface. Suppression of iRHOM2-mediated ADAM17 maturation prevented surface expression and exosomal release of ADAM17. Further, deletion of the protease's C-terminus or cell treatment with a calcium chelator diminished exosomal release as well as surface downregulation of ADAM17, underlining that both processes are closely associated. Co-incubation of ADAM17 containing exosomes with cells expressing the ADAM17 substrates TGFα or amphiregulin lead to increased shedding of both substrates. This was prevented when exosomes were prepared from cells with shRNA-mediated ADAM17 knockdown. These data indicate that cell stimulation can downregulate expression of mature ADAM17 from the cell surface and induce release of exosomal ADAM17, which can then distribute and contribute to substrate shedding on more distant cells.

Abstract: The effect of light intensity on the External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) of encapsulated bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPV) is presented. The measurements were applied to devices based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) blended with the fullerene derivative phenylC61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in as-produced and various degradation states. The degradation of current collection in the OPV devices is shown to enhance the sub-linear dependence of the short-circuit current on light intensity, and the corresponding EQE decrease with increasing incident light intensity. On the other hand, fresh cells and cells exposed to a low photon dose demonstrated an increase in the fullerene-related part of the EQE with increasing light intensity, i.e. a super-linear dependence of the photocurrent in this spectral range. Generation of traps in PCBM was proposed as the underlying mechanism for this effect. Perusal of our results suggests that (1) EQE dependence on the incident light intensity should be always taken into account in measuring spectral response of fresh OPV and especially of degraded devices; (2) intensity-dependent characterization provides an insight to the degradation mechanisms of OPV and can help to separate degradation in absorption/generation from degradation of the charge collection in the cell.

Abstract: Two different mesoporous films of TiO2 were coated onto a QCM disc and fired at 450°C for 30min. The first film was derived from a sol–gel paste that was popular in the early days of dye-sensitised solar cells, i.e. dssc, research, a TiO2(sg) film. The other was a commercial colloidal paste used to make examples of the current dssc cell; a TiO2(ds) film. A QCM was used to determine the mass of the TiO2 film deposited on each disc and the increase in the mass of the film when immersed in water/glycerol solutions with wt% values spanning the range 0–70%. The results of this work reveal that with both TiO2 mesoporous films the solution fills the film's pores and acts as a rigid mass, thereby allowing the porosity of each film to be calculated as: 59.1% and 71.6% for the TiO2(sg) and TiO2(ds) films, respectively. These results, coupled with surface area data, allowed the pore radii of the two films to be calculated as: 9.6 and 17.8nm, respectively. This method is then simplified further, to just a few frequency measurements in water and only air to reveal the same porosity values. The value of the latter ‘one point’ method for making porosity measurements is discussed briefly.

Abstract: The light propagation in multiscale textured thin film silicon solar cells is studied experimentally and numerically. The short circuit current and energy conversion efficiency of multiscale textured amorphous silicon thin film solar cells are increased compared to nanoscale textured substrates. A gain of the short circuit current of 1.3mA/cm2 is achieved for the multiscale textured solar cell, resulting in short circuit current densities of 16.8mA/cm2 and energy conversion efficiency of 10.7%. The light propagation in the solar cells is determined by Finite Difference Time Domain simulations in three dimensions using realistic interface morphologies. The realistic interface morphologies of solar cells are calculated by 3D algorithms. The optical simulations reveal that the interface morphology of the back reflector of the multiscale textured solar cell has a distinct influence on the short circuit current and quantum efficiency. By tuning the optical losses of the metal back reflector, the short circuit current can be increased beyond 18mA/cm2.

Abstract: Perovskite photovoltaic cells (PVs) have attracted significant worldwide attention in the past few years. Although the stability of the power conversion is a concern, there is great potential for perovskites to enter the global PV market. To determine the future potential of perovskites, we performed a cradle-to-gate environmental life cycle (LCA) for two different perovskite device structures suitable for low cost manufacturing. Rather than examining current laboratory deposition processes like dipping and spinning, we considered spray and co-evaporation methods that are more amenable to manufacturing. A structure with an inorganic hole transport layer (HTL) was developed for both solution and vacuum based processes, and an HTL-free structure with printed with back contact was modeled for solution based deposition. The environmental impact of conventional Si PV technology was used as a reference point. The environmental impacts from manufacturing of perovskite solar cells were lower than that of mono-Si. However, environmental impacts from unit electricity generated were higher than all commercial PV technology mainly because of the shorter lifetime of perovskite solar cell. The HTL-free perovskite generally had the lowest environmental impacts among the three structures studied. Solution based methods used in perovskite deposition were observed to decrease the overall electricity consumption. Organic materials used for preparing the precursors for perovskite deposition were found to cause a high marine eutrophication impact. Surprisingly, the toxicity impacts of the lead used in the formation of the absorber layer were found to be negligible. Energy payback times were estimated as 1.0–1.5 years.

Abstract: In this study we quantify the possible gains in cell performance obtained with an architecture based on through-cell via contacts (TCVC). We review how the front metallization of solar cells introduces a compromise between shadowing and resistive losses. The work models the trade-offs that directly impacts the device efficiency. Gains at the cell level are important because they are highly leveraged in HCPV systems. For a very high illumination flux, a standard cell optimization leads to a large metallized area for finger grid designs. Our modeling shows that the back-contact architectures can offer an interesting alternative. The TCVCs were evaluated using a multijunction InGaP/InGaAs/Ge solar cell (MJSC). The proposed architecture is modeled and compared with a conventional grid design. The absolute efficiencies of the different solar cells were calculated to quantify their shadowing and resistive losses. A combination of finite-element modeling and equivalent-circuit calculations were used. Our study finds that an absolute efficiency improvement of 1.8% could be obtained over a conventional MJSC design by using a basic via contact design for a light concentration of 2000 suns. This gain attains 3.0% when cross-fingers are added to the design. Furthermore, we show that the TCVCs are expected to be a cost-effective solution because the removal of bus bars area improves significantly the wafer utilization. The latter improvement is estimated to result in an increase in power generation of about 20% per wafer.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate correlations between optical and electro-optical properties of GaAsPN/GaP p–i–n solar cells grown by MBE on GaP(001) substrates. A photoluminescence model is first proposed to extract the long range compositional fluctuation energy scale from low temperature photoluminescence spectra of the GaAsPN dilute-nitride material. Solar cells grown with the same nitrogen content at different temperature reveal very different electrical performances. A 4.08mA/cm2 short-circuit current density has been obtained, that is an excellent value given the small absorber thickness (300nm) and high material bandgap. Comparisons between solar cells photoluminescence, I–V (under AM1.5G illumination) and IQE parameters reveal correlations between their optical and electrical parameters. These results reinforce PL measurements interest for dilute nitride solar cells growth optimization.

Abstract: In this work, a simple strategy was used to prepare Ti3+ surface defect states through the simple UV irradiation of TiO2 nanotubes (TiNT) formed in ethylene glycol/NH4F/H3PO4/H2O mixture at different anodizing potentials. The band gap electronic states created by Ti3+ are mostly responsible for the effective narrowing of band gap. The effect of anodizing potential on surface states of TiO2 nanotubes/electrolyte interface has been studied under UV irradiation. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of surface states of TiNT formed at different anodizing potential was performed using capacitance measurements. These measurements allow us to provide evidence for the presence of monoenergetic surface states in the band gap. The energy levels and the density of surface states have been determined. Both density and energetic location are very dependent on the geometric characteristics. Relatively wide distribution of these states in a range of electric energy of 0.17–0.35eV below the edge of the conduction band was obtained according to the anodizing potential. The optical absorption at 630nm may be attributed to deep level states originated from oxygen vacancies associated with Ti3+. The presence of energetic level states and elevated surface solid fraction factor of TiNT are the determining factors in enhancing the photoactivity in visible light as evidenced by high photocurrent densities up to 16mAcm−2.

Abstract: Following dip coating procedure, we have fabricated extended photocatalytic surface (40mm×25mm) of TiO2, nitrogen doped TiO2 (N–TiO2), porous TiO2 (porous-TiO2), nitrogen doped porous TiO2 (porous-N–TiO2) materials over glass slides. A red shift was observed giving a bandgap of 2.56eV for nitrogen doped TiO2. Raman Scattering shows predominant anatase phase in all the samples along with rutile phase. Using di-chloro fluorescein (DCFH) as a fluorescence reporter molecule, we have characterized OH radical generation. Results show a 5.69×10−8ppm/cm2/s of OH radicals are generated in porous-N–TiO2 coated surface compared to 3.69×10−8ppm/cm2/s in TiO2 which confer a 1.54 increase in the utilization of visible light ability to the catalyst. Photocatalytic ability quantified with Methylene Blue degradation gave ~1.48 fold increase under visible light exposure for porous-N–TiO2 relative to TiO2 and the same was 1.1 fold for UV–visible light exposure. Further, the best catalytic degradation turn-over of the surface determined to be 4.55×10−7ppm/cm2/s and 1.61×10−7ppm/cm2/s respectively for UV–vis and visible light exposure. Thus a robust and simpler dip coating methodology giving enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity in polymer mediated nitrogen doped TiO2 system has been demonstrated on a large surface area. We conclude that modification of bandgap of TiO2 by nitrogen doping together with polymer mediated porosity has resulted in a strong visible light activity for this material. Since dip coating approach adopted here is cost-effective and amenable to large scale coating processes, it holds potential in the fabrication of large-scale self-cleansing and antimicrobial surfaces for application in medical and diagnostic industries.

The novel mechanism of rotenone-induced α-synuclein phosphorylation via reduced protein phosphatase 2A activity,

Abstract: Rotenone has been shown to induce many parkinsonian features and has been widely used in chemical models of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Its use is closely associated with α-synuclein (α-syn) phosphorylation both in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanisms whereby rotenone regulates α-syn phosphorylation remain unknown. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been shown to play an important role in α-syn dephosphorylation. We therefore investigated if rotenone caused α-syn phosphorylation by down-regulation of PP2A activity in mice. Rotenone increased the phosphorylation of α-syn at Ser129, consistent with the inhibition of PP2A activity by increased phosphorylation of tyrosine 307 at the catalytic subunit of PP2A (pTyr307 PP2Ac). We further explored the interactions among rotenone, PP2A, and α-syn in SK-N-SH cells and primary rat cortical neurons. Rotenone inhibited PP2A activity via phosphorylation of PP2Ac at Tyr307. The reduction in PP2A activity and rotenone cytotoxicity were reversed by treatment with the PP2A agonist, C2 ceramide, and the Src kinase inhibitor, SKI606. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that rotenone induced an increase in calmodulin–Src complex in SK-N-SH cells, thus activating Src kinase, which in turn phosphorylated PP2A at Tyr307 and inhibited its activity. C2 ceramide and SKI606 significantly reversed the rotenone-induced phosphorylation and aggregation of α-syn by increasing PP2A activity. These results demonstrate that rotenone-reduced PP2A activity via Src kinase is involved in the phosphorylation of α-syn. These findings clarify the novel mechanisms whereby rotenone can induce PD.

Abstract: CuSbS2 (CAS) thin films were fabricated by non-toxic, low-cost and simple non-vacuum methods using hybrid inks, which is a well-known method for fabricating CuInSe2 (CIS) films. Hybrid inks with and without nanoparticles were both tested. CAS thin films were formed on Mo-coated soda lime glass through the sulfurization of spin-coated, as-deposited films. After sulfurization, EDS, XRD, and SEM were used to analyze film composition, crystal structure and morphology. Synthesized Cu–S binary nanoparticles were used in the hybrid ink containing nanoparticles. However, Sb2S3 was formed as a by-product with CuSbS2 after sulfurization. On the other hand, for the hybrid ink containing no nanoparticles, only the CuSbS2 phase was obtained, which enhanced the photovoltaic performance of the cell. The highest conversion efficiency of the fabricated device using the structure Mo/CuSbS2/CdS/i-ZnO/n-ZnO/Al was 3.22%.

Abstract: The paper aims at exploring the performances of a compact Desiccant Evaporative Cooling system called “Freescoo” (Free Solar Cooling) in comparison to standard conventional technologies. The Freescoo – that aims at applications in the residential sector and in small office buildings and includes a photovoltaic–thermal system – is analyzed, its monitored performance discussed and reported: under cooling conditions an Energy Efficiency Ratio of 12.8 is calculated, that reaches 50.7 if also photovoltaic generation is considered. To assess the performance of the proposed system a Life Cycle Assessment study was performed to investigate the system covering all its life, from the production, going through its use and its disposal. Results are compared to those obtainable by standard conventional systems with comparable heating and cooling power outputs to further explore the performances of the system. The electricity consumption of the investigated solar cooling system proves to be equal to only the 5% of the equivalent conventional system having the same thermal output during a year. The production phase of the Freescoo shows a predominant role among the other life cycle steps, reaching a 95% share on the total for some indicators, such as human toxicity. If the life cycle phase of a conventional system is compared with the whole life cycle of the Freescoo system, the former would report many indicators values higher by 200% in comparison to the latter. If use of water is considered, although the Freescoo system would require 2590l of fresh water during a year in comparison to none consumed by a conventional system, the higher water footprint of conventional systems would result in water uses higher by three times if compared to the Freescoo.

Abstract: A novel triple-layered transparent conductive film, AZO/Pd/AZO (APA), was deposited via magnetron sputtering on glass substrate at room temperature. The structural, morphological, electrical and optical properties of the APA films were systematically investigated with various Pd layer thicknesses and annealing temperatures in hydrogen atmosphere. The experiment results show that APA films are polycrystalline with a preferred (002) orientation. Comparing with that for the un-annealed films, the resistivity of APA film annealed in hydrogen atmosphere rapidly decreases from 1.84×10−3Ωcm to 4.8×10−4Ωcm, while the transmittance decreased slightly with increasing annealing temperature to 400°C. Optical measurements indicated that the optical band gap (Eg) of APA films varies from 3.37eV to 3.69eV with adjusting annealing temperature from 200°C to 500°C. The very low resistivity of 4.8×10−4Ωcm with a sheet resistance of 45Ω/sq, a transmittance of 83.2% and a figure of merit value of 3.53×10−3Ω−1 were obtained by AZO (50nm)/Pd (7nm)/AZO (50nm) structure after hydrogen annealing at 400°C. These results support that the use of Pd insertion in transparent metal oxide electrode for its hydrogen sensitive property.

Abstract: The microencapsulation of phase change materials (PCMs) with regenerated silk fibroin (SF) as a shell by means of SF self-assembling was studied. Nonionic, ionic and mixed surfactants were applied to increase the emulsion stability and enhance encapsulating capacity of SF microcapsules. Effects of different types of surfactants on diverse properties of PCM microcapsules including morphology, energy storage density, mechanical strength and thermal stability have been investigated. It was observed that mixed surfactants promoted significantly the formation and stability of n-octadecane/SF emulsion. With the effects of co-emulsifiers, mixed surfactants acted simultaneously as excellent emulsifiers and cross-linkers in SF microencapsulation processing. Adding mixed surfactants to n-octadecane/SF system improved the surface morphology and energy storage density, along with the mechanical strength.

Abstract: Non-destructive characterization of both single layers and completed devices are important issues for the development of efficient and low cost Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS) modules at high yields. This implies for the need of methodologies suitable for the assessment of optical, electrical, and physico-chemical parameters that are relevant for the final device efficiency and that can be used for quality control and process monitoring at different process steps. In these applications, detection of in-homogeneities in the different layers from large area modules is especially relevant, being the presence of these inhomogeneities responsible for the existing gap between the efficiencies achieved in these technologies at cell and module levels. In this context, this work reviews the different optical methodologies that have been developed in the framework of the SCALENANO European project for the advanced assessment of the different layers in high efficiency electrodeposited – based CIGS devices. This has includes different strategies as those based on Raman scattering, Photoluminescence/Electroluminescence (PL/EL) based techniques and new photoelectrochemical based tools and firstly Raman spectroscopy is very sensitive to both composition and crystal quality parameters that are determining for device efficiency. Use of resonant Raman excitation strategies allows achieving a high sensitivity of the Raman spectra to the analysed features in the different regions of the device. This involves selection of the suitable excitation wavelength (in the broad spectral region from UV to IR) for the resonant Raman excitation of the required layer in the device. The strong increase in the intensity of the Raman peaks related to the use of resonant excitation conditions allows also decreasing the measuring time to times compatible with the implementation of these techniques at online process monitoring level. Analysed parameters include the electrical conductivity of the Al-doped ZnO window layer, the thickness of the CdS buffer layer and the chemical composition (S/(S+Se) relative content) and presence of relevant secondary phases as Cu-poor ordered vacancy compounds in the surface region of the absorbers. In addition PL/EL imaging are powerful techniques that provide direct access to the optoelectronic properties of the materials and devices. Whereas EL is performed using complete devices by injecting current in analogy to the operation of a light emitting diode, PL allows the characterization of bare absorber materials without the need for any functional or contacting layers. Moreover, semiconductor photo-electrochemistry (PEC) is a versatile technique that enables many opto-electronic properties of semiconductors to be determined. Essentially, a semiconductor on a conducting substrate placed in a solution containing redox species forms a Schottky barrier junction. The formation of such a diode enables basic semiconductor properties to be measured such as doping type, doping density, band gap and the flat band position versus the vacuum energy scale. In all these cases, quality control indicators suitable for the advanced assessment of these processes have been identified and validated for the electrodeposition-based processes developed at Nexcis Company.

Abstract: A self-standing all-in-one electrochromic gel utilizing phenyl viologen (PV) and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (TMPD) as the electrochromic materials is prepared by incorporating a thermo-cured cross-linked polymer matrix. The thermal-cured polymer matrix can prevent the agglomeration of PV happening on the electrode surface, resulting in the excellent write–erase ability of the obtained gelated ECD. Moreover, the cross-linker which possesses the long propoxylated arms leads to the easier diffusion for both PV and TMPD in the obtained polymer network. As a result, the obtained ECD exhibits a large transmittance change (ΔT>67% at 620nm) within a short response time (<3.5s) under an extremely low driving voltage (0.5V). Besides, this device remains over 55% of ΔT after 10,000 cycles of switching.

Abstract: Patterns for fully printed polymer solar cells are presented that inherently enable scaling of the power output with single point electrical energy connection is presented. Connection is made to only one end of the printed foil that can be rolled out for light energy harvesting. The power level is simply increased/decreased by increasing/decreasing the length of the foil with a corresponding increase/decrease in operating voltage. The current flow runs in both directions along the printed foil thus alleviating the need for post process addition of complex busbar topologies. The power conversion takes place in a HVDC–DC converter that is tailored specifically for operation with polymer solar cells by regulation on the input side. The system charges a lithium-polymer battery thus enabling storage of 82Wh for a printed OPV foil measuring 0.305m×9m having a nominal power output of at least 15W (AM1.5G, 1000Wm−2). As a demonstration we present a scalable fully integrated and compact power unit for mobile applications comprising solar energy harvesting OPV modules, power conversion and storage. Applications possible include electrical charging of mobile devices, illumination using LED lamps and low mechanical power applications such as pumping water.

Abstract: All inorganic solid-state thin-film electrochromic devices based on lithium ion (Li+) insertion and using lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) as the ion conductor were fabricated by physical vapor deposition technology. Multilayer architecture consisting of TCO/V2O5/LiPON/LixWO3/TCO was deposited by RF sputtering technology on glass substrate. Electro-optical characterization carried out on complete devices highlighted transmittance changes as large as 40% at 600nm wavelength upon ±1.5V voltage application, with coloring and bleaching time of 30s. Several hundreds of bleaching/coloration cycles have been carried out with almost no performance degradation. The effect of the multilayer architecture was investigated. The results showed interactions between the depositing and the deposited layers, which influences the total amount of injected charges and hence the device performance. In particular, it has been observed a reversibly inserted Li+ charge capacity during LiPON deposition and a charge capacity extraction during deposition in presence of lithiated layers. The described phenomena should be considered in order to achieve the charge balance between the electrodes for optimum device performance.

Abstract: We investigated the relationship between the electrical properties (of the n-oxide semiconductor layer and the p-Cu2O sheet) and the obtainable photovoltaic properties of Al-doped ZnO (AZO)/n-oxide/p-Cu2O heterojunction solar cells that were fabricated using either p-type non-doped Cu2O or Na-doped Cu2O (Cu2O:Na) sheets (prepared by thermally oxidizing a Cu sheet) functioning as the active layer as well as the substrate. We fabricated some heterojunction solar cells using p-Cu2O (non-doped) sheets and n-ZnO thin films with various electron concentrations (N) in the range of 1017―1020cm−3; non-doped and Al- or Cu-doped ZnO thin films were deposited under various O2 or O3 gas atmosphere pressures using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. The obtained photovoltaic properties exhibited a tendency to increase as N was increased from 1017 to about 3×1019cm−3; the values remained at these maximum levels as N was increased to about 8×1019cm−3, and then they decreased as N was increased further. With an N on the order of 1020cm−3, the reduction of photovoltaic properties was attributed to an increase in the discontinuity of the conduction band at the interface between the n-ZnO and p-Cu2O layers. In addition, we found that the hole concentration (P) in Cu2O:Na sheets (i.e., Cu2O sheets postannealed with various Na compounds) could be controlled in the range of 1014―1019cm−3 by varying the annealing temperature and duration. As another example, the obtained photovoltaic properties in heterojunction solar cells that were fabricated by depositing n-(Ga0.975Al0.025)2O3 thin films on p-Cu2O:Na sheets by PLD remained constant as P was increased to approximately 1×1016cm−3, and then they decreased significantly as P was increased further. The reduction of the obtained photovoltaic properties in heterojunction solar cells fabricated using Cu2O:Na sheets with a P above about 1.4×1016cm−3 was attributed mainly to decreases of both the depletion layer width and the diffusion length.

Abstract: The plasmonic photovoltaic effect of mediation by surface plasmons in the harvesting of solar light energy in metallically surface-nanomodified photodiodes or solar cells is described in the microscopic manner. The experimentally observed increase in the efficiency of the photo-effect due to plasmons is explained by the competition between two opposing effects: that of the field concentration in plasmon oscillations and that of the admittance of indirect inter-band transitions in a semiconductor substrate induced by dipole coupling to plasmons at the nanoscale without translational invariance. The former effect favors larger metallic nanocomponents, whereas the latter effect prefers smaller nanocomponents. Both factors are quantitatively addressed within the quantum Fermi golden rule scheme, which allows for the size analysis of the plasmon effect and for its optimization. Experimental verification of the theoretical predictions is presented, including the demonstration of the proximity and size effect in double-layer photo-active substrate. The experiment reveals that the plasmon effect is still present if metallic nanoparticles are separated from substrate by the distance of order of 1μm.

Abstract: Using direct steam generation in concentrated solar power plant leads to the development of new storage systems, which may include a latent heat thermal energy storage module. With this module, the behavior of the storage system matches the thermal behavior of the water used as heat transfer fluid. Sodium nitrate, which is already used in such lab-scale systems, is able to fulfill the conditions to assume the role of phase change material to store thermal energy. However, this material may evolve during its lifetime, either due to thermal decomposition or by corrosion phenomena, both leading to the reduction of nitrates to nitrites. Such evolution has been reported for the so-called "solar–salt" (NaNO3–KNO3 60:40wt%), driving to the reduction of the melting temperature and latent heat. It is thus important to study the evolution of these properties in the case of sodium nitrate. The work proposed here aims to characterize sodium nitrate–nitrite mixture by differential scanning calorimetry for comparison with pure sodium nitrate (laboratory grade and industrial grade). Since the considered compounds are not at the eutectic composition, their melting does not occur at a fixed and single temperature. Thus, a calorimetric method using isothermal steps has been used in order to determine the evolution of involved energy during the melting of samples versus temperature for each sample. The results show the spreading of the melting over a range of temperature and the shifting of the liquidus to lower temperature when the sodium nitrite part increases. Moreover, a decrease in latent heat up to nearly 15% was observed.

Abstract: Using density-functional theory in combination with the nonequilibrium Green׳s function formalism, we study the effect of the crystal lattice structure of organometallic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 on its electronic transport properties. Both dispersive interactions and spin–orbit coupling are taken into account in describing structural and electronic properties of the system. We consider two different phases of the material, namely the orthorhombic and cubic lattice structures, which are energetically stable at low (<160K) and high (>330K) temperatures, respectively. The sizable geometrical differences between the two structures in term of lattice parameters, PbI6 octahedral tilts, rotation and deformations, have considerable impact on the transport properties of the material. For example, at zero bias and for all considered electron energies, the cubic phase has a larger transmission than the orthorhombic one, although both show similar electronic densities of states. Depending on the applied voltage, the current in the cubic system can be several orders of magnitude larger as compared to the one obtained for the orthorhombic sample. We attribute this enhancement in the transmission to the presence of extended states in the cubic phase due to the symmetrically shaped and ordered PbI6 octaherdra.

Abstract: Cardiac progenitors, such as cardiospheres and cardiosphere-derived cells, represent an attractive cell source for cardiac regeneration. The PIWI-interacting RNAs, piRNAs, are an intriguing class of small non-coding RNAs, implicated in the regulation of epigenetic state, maintenance of genomic integrity and stem cell functions. Although non-coding RNAs are an exploiting field in cardiovascular research, the piRNA signatures of cardiac progenitors has not been evaluated yet.We profiled, through microarrays, 15,311 piRNAs expressed in cardiospheres, cardiosphere-derived cells and cardiac fibroblasts. Results showed a set of differentially expressed piRNAs (fold change ≥2, p<0.01): 641 piRNAs were upregulated and 1,301 downregulated in the cardiospheres compared to cardiosphere-derived cells, while 255 and 708 piRNAs resulted up- and down-regulated, respectively, if compared to cardiac fibroblasts. We also identified 181 piRNAs that are overexpressed and 129 are downregulated in cardiosphere-derived cells respect to cardiac fibroblasts.Bioinformatics analysis showed that the deregulated piRNAs were mainly distributed on few chromosomes, suggesting that piRNAs are organized in discrete genomic clusters.Furthermore, the bioinformatics search showed that the most upregulated piRNAs target transposons, especially belonged to LINE-1 class, as validated by qRT-PCR. This reduction is also associated to an activation of AKT signaling, which is beneficial for cardiac regeneration.The present study is the first to show a highly consistent piRNA expression pattern for human cardiac progenitors, likely responsible of their different regenerative power. Moreover, this piRNome analysis may provide new methods for characterize cardiac progenitors and may shed new light on the understanding the complex molecular mechanisms of cardiac regeneration.

Abstract: The characterization of synthetic superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION) surfaces prior to functionalization is an essential step in the prediction of their successful functionalization, and in uncovering issues that may influence their selection as magnetically targeted drug delivery vehicles (prodrugs). Here, three differently functionalized magnetite (Fe3O4) SPIONs are considered. All were identically prepared by the alkaline coprecipitation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ salts. We use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron microscopy, time-of-flight SIMS, FTIR spectroscopy and magnetic measurements to characterize their chemical, morphological and magnetic properties, in order to aid in determining how their surfaces differ from those prepared by Fe(CO)5 decomposition, which we have already studied, and in assessing their potential use as drug delivery carriers.

Abstract: The stability of slot-die coated flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules with inverted structures of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/photoactive layer/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/Ag was analyzed under damp heat conditions. The work primarily focused on the understanding of the degradation mechanism of organic photovoltaic modules in very severe operating conditions (85°C/85% relative humidity [rh]). The electrical change of the OPV module was measured as a function of the aging time under damp heat. A rapid drop in the efficiency of the module was observed, mainly caused by the decline of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). We supposed that the degradation of the modules mainly progressed by the oxygen and moisture penetrating the terminals or at the edges of the barrier films. The physical modification of the layers composing the device by degradation was observed; hence, morphological and chemical analyses were conducted. The analyses revealed that Ag atoms migrated to the interlayers of the cell, resulting in the increase of shunt paths; this was the main reason underlying the reduction of Voc and FF of the OPV module under damp heat. The ZnO layer was also etched by the acidic molecules from the diffused PEDOT:PSS polymer. In addition, the performance parameters of several OPV modules were evaluated simultaneously under damp heat conditions for 1000h. The same lifetime patterns were observed although the initial efficiencies of the modules were diverse. The interpretation of the lifetime patterns and a suggestion for an objective comparison between the modules showing different initial efficiencies were also addressed.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) induces the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast epithelial cells and plays an important role in mammary morphogenesis and breast cancer. In non-transformed breast epithelial cells TGF-β antagonizes epidermal growth factor (EGF) action and induces growth inhibition. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been reported to participate in lumen formation during morphogenesis of human breast epithelial cells. Our previous work indicated that sensitivity of human breast epithelial cells to TRAIL can be modulated through the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor-1 (EGFR). Here, we show that TGF-β opposes EGF-mediated sensitization to TRAIL-induced caspase-8 activation and apoptosis in non-transformed breast epithelial cells. Death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) formation by TRAIL was significantly reduced in cells treated with TGF-β. TGF-β treatment activates cytoprotective autophagy and down-regulates TRAIL-R2 expression at the cell surface by promoting the intracellular accumulation of this receptor. Lastly, we demonstrate that EMT is not involved in the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on apoptosis by TRAIL. Together, the data reveal a fine regulation by EGF and TGF-β of sensitivity of human breast epithelial cells to TRAIL which may be relevant during morphogenesis.

Abstract: The linear optical properties of Cu2ZnSn1−xGexS4 high quality single crystals with a wide range of Ge contents (x=0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 and 1) have been investigated in the ultraviolet and near infrared range using spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements. From the analysis of the complex dielectric function spectra it has been found that the bandgap E0 increases continuously from 1.49eV to 2.25eV with the Ge content. Furthermore, the evolution of the interband transitions E1A and E1B has been also determined. Raman scattering using three different excitation wavelengths and its analysis have been performed to confirm the absence of secondary phases in the samples, and to distinguish between stannite, wurtzite, wurzstannite and kesterite structures. Additionally, the analysis of the high resolution Raman spectra obtained in samples with different [Ge]/([Ge]+[Sn]) ratios allows describing a bimodal behavior of the dominant A modes. The understanding of the incorporation of Ge into the Cu2ZnSnS4 lattice is fundamental in order to develop efficient bandgap engineering of these compounds towards the fabrication of kesterite based solar cells with enhanced performance.

Abstract: The Forkhead box-containing protein, O subfamily 3 (FoxO3) transcription factor negatively regulates myocardial hypertrophy, and its transcriptional activity is finely conditioned by diverse posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, methylation and glycosylation. Here, we introduce a novel modification of the FoxO3 protein in cardiomyocytes: poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) mediated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1). This process catalyzes the NAD+-dependent synthesis of polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) and their subsequent attachment to target proteins by PARPs. Primary-cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were incubated with isoproterenol (ISO) to induce hypertrophy, or were infected with recombinant adenovirus vectors harboring PARP1 cDNA (Ad-PARP1). Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were treated with ISO to induce cardiac hypertrophy, or were injected with Ad-PARP1 into the anterior and posterior left ventricular walls. Cardiomyocyte surface area, the mRNA expression of hypertrophic biomarkers, echocardiography, morphometry of the hearts were measured. The PARP1 activity was tested by cellular PAR levels. Interactions of PARP1 and FoxO3 were investigated by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence technique. PARylation of FoxO3 mediated by PARP1 facilitated its phosphorylation at the T32, S252 and S314 sites, triggered its nucleus export and suppressed its transcriptional activity and target genes expression, ultimately inducing cardiac hypertrophy. Additionally, PARP1 silencing or specific inhibition by 3-Aminobenzamide (3AB) and veliparib (ABT-888) alleviated the inhibition of FoxO3 activity by ISO, thus suppressing ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Our data provide the first evidence that PARP1 exacerbates cardiac hypertrophy by PARylation of FoxO3.

Abstract: Polymeric microbubbles (MBs) are gas filled particles composed of a thin stabilized polymer shell that have been recently developed as valid contrast agents for the combined use of ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) imaging. Due to their buoyancy, the commonly available approaches to study their behaviour in complex media are not easily applicable and their use in modern medicine requires such behaviour to be fully elucidated. Here we have used for the first time flow cytometry as a new high throughput approach that allows characterisation of the MB dispersion, prior to and after exposure in different biological media and we have additionally developed a method that allows characterisation of the strongly bound proteins adsorbed on the MBs, to fully predict their biological behaviour in biological milieu.

Abstract: High quality ultrathin transition-metal dichalcogenide films and their Vander Waals heterostructures are very promising for fabrication of optoelectronic devices for their superior photovoltaic performance, extreme flexibility and long lifetime due to suitable band gap and excellent light absorption capability. Designing the appropriate and suitable band structures of these materials is crucial for its promising applications. Especially, thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) film is further attractive as compare to its monolayer counterpart for broad-spectral photo-detectors and photovoltaic application. However, very little understanding regarding the underlying physics behind the photo-response behavior of thin MoS2 films is known. Here, we demonstrate a large photovoltaic response in thin MoS2 films which produces an enormous photo-generated carrier and enhance the photocurrent by forming a heterojunction with p-type Si substrate. MoS2 based photovoltaic devices efficiently produce high short-circuit photocurrent values of 18mA/cm2 and reasonably high power-conversion efficiency up to 4.5%. The present work will provide valuable scientific input of layered MoS2 films for other emerging optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: Here, we developed a novel and facile approach to fabricating TiO2 Nanotubes Membranes (TNMs) with thicknesses between 539 and 1930nm. These were detached from a Ti substrate through immersion in water, followed by adhesion to a conducting fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass using an adhesion layer and annealing in order to form an anatase crystalline structure for transparent electrochromic applications. The possible mechanism of the TNM separation process in deionized water was evaluated using contact angle analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The TNM electrodes exhibited remarkable electrochromic performances, combining high coloration contrast with a transmittance of 65% in the visible spectrum and good cycle stability, which was maintained at 88.2% for initial optical modulation after 1000 cycles. These TNMs may advance the design of efficient and low-cost electrodes operating in the visible light spectrum that are intended for photo electrochemical applications.

Abstract: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) through innate immune system recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns and play an important role in host defense against bacteria, fungi and viruses. TLR-7 is responsible for sensing single stranded nucleic acids of viruses but its activation has been shown to be protective in mouse models of asthma. The NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes family mainly produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the lung and is involved in regulation of airway inflammation in response to TLRs activation. However, NOX-4 mediated signaling in response to TLR-7 activation in a mouse model of allergic asthma has not been explored previously. Therefore, this study investigated the role TLR-7 activation and downstream oxidant–antioxidant signaling in a murine model of asthma. Mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) intraperitoneally and treated with TLR-7 agonist, resiquimod (RSQ) intranasally before each OVA challenge from days 14 to 16. Mice were then assessed for airway reactivity, inflammation, and NOX-4 and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) related signaling [inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitrotyrosine, lipid peroxides and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD)]. Treatment with RSQ reduced allergen induced airway reactivity and inflammation. This was paralleled by a decrease in ROS which was due to induction of Nrf2 and Cu/Zn SOD in RSQ treated group. Inhibition of MyD88 reversed RSQ-mediated protective effects on airway reactivity/inflammation due to reduction in Nrf2 signaling. SOD inhibition produced effects similar to MyD88 inhibition. The current study suggests that TLR-7 agonist is beneficial and may be developed into a therapeutic option in allergic asthma.

Abstract: The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor is multi-functional. APC is known to localize at the centrosome, and in mitotic cells contributes to formation of the mitotic spindle. To test whether APC contributes to nascent microtubule (MT) growth at interphase centrosomes, we employed MT regrowth assays in U2OS cells to measure MT assembly before and after nocodazole treatment and release. We showed that siRNA knockdown of full-length APC delayed both initial MT aster formation and MT elongation/regrowth. In contrast, APC-mutant SW480 cancer cells displayed a defect in MT regrowth that was unaffected by APC knockdown, but which was rescued by reconstitution of full-length APC. Our findings identify APC as a positive regulator of centrosome MT initial assembly and suggest that this process is disrupted by cancer mutations. We confirmed that full-length APC associates with the MT-nucleation factor γ-tubulin, and found that the APC cancer-truncated form (1–1309) also bound to γ-tubulin through APC amino acids 1–453. While binding to γ-tubulin may help target APC to the site of MT nucleation complexes, additional C-terminal sequences of APC are required to stimulate and stabilize MT growth.

Abstract: A systematic investigation of the utilization of indium-tin-oxide (ITO) as a current spreading layer (CSL) with and without a textured surface has been performed on InGaN-based solar cells, demonstrating a difference in the influence on the performance of the devices. It is found that employing an ITO CSL improves the conversion efficiency for devices with planar surfaces; whereas it reduces the efficiency for the surface textured devices. Consequently, best performance is achieved for the surface-textured solar cell without employing an ITO CSL, with an enhancement of 75% in the conversion efficiency compared to the planar cell without ITO. Our reflectance measurements show that the ITO CSL can effectively suppress surface reflection for the planar devices, while it becomes less effective for the surface-textured devices. Furthermore, a transmission measurement is carried out to estimate the absorption of the ITO CSL. The influence of the ITO CSL is discussed in terms of surface reflection and light loss due to the ITO shading effect as well as power loss associated with the absence of the ITO CSL.

Treatment of embryoid bodies with 10% static mechanical strain using a Flexercell strain system significantly increased CD31-positive vascular structures and the angiogenesis guidance molecules plexinB1, ephrin B2, neuropilin1 (NRP1), semaphorin 4D (sem4D) and robo4 as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) as evaluated by Western blot and real time RT-PCR. In contrast ephrin type 4 receptor B (EphB4) expression was down-regulated upon mechanical strain, indicating an arterial-type differentiation. Robo1 protein expression was modestly increased with no change in mRNA expression. Mechanical strain increased intracellular calcium as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). Mechanical strain-induced vasculogenesis was abolished by the NOS inhibitor L-NAME, the NADPH oxidase inhibitor VAS2870, upon chelation of intracellular calcium by BAPTA as well as upon siRNA inactivation of ephrin B2, NRP1 and robo4. BAPTA blunted the strain-induced expression of angiogenic growth factors, the increase in NO and ROS as well as the expression of NRP1, sem4D and plexinB1, whereas ephrin B2, EphB4 as well as robo1 and robo4 expression were not impaired.
Conclusions
Mechanical strain stimulates vasculogenesis of ES cells by the intracellular messengers ROS, NO and calcium as well as by upregulation of angiogenesis guidance molecules and the angiogenic growth factors VEGF, FGF-2 and PDGF-BB.

Abstract: Ge-incorporated Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTGSe) thin films were prepared, and their materials and device properties were examined. The CZTGSe thin films were prepared using a two-step process comprising co-evaporation of each element and a subsequent annealing step. Ge atoms were successfully incorporated into the Cu2ZnSnSe4 thin films, and the band-gap (Eg) of CZTGSe was controlled via the full Ge/(Sn+Ge) ratio range of 0–1. In addition, the annealing environment containing GeSe2 led to CZTGSe thin films with flat surfaces, dense morphologies, and large grains comparable to their thickness. The highest efficiency achieved with the fabricated CZTGSe solar cells was 10.03%, with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.54V. The CZTGSe thin-film solar cells exhibited an improved VOC deficit (Eg/q−VOC, q: electron charge) of 0.647V, which is comparable to that of high-efficiency Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 solar cells.

Abstract: Si (001)-oriented substrates (p-type) were implanted at 10keV with He+ ion doses in the 5×1015cm−2 range. They were annealed at 973K for 1h to create a buried layer of nano-sized bubbles. Layers of Si0.77Ge0.23 about 215nm thick were grown by low pressure chemical vapor deposition at 848K on these silicon wafers. The surface roughness and morphology were checked by atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy before and after etching with a modified Shimmel recipe to reveal etch pit dislocations. The thickness, composition, crystalline quality and relaxation-state of the SiGe layer were assessed by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and high-resolution X-ray diffraction. A fully relaxed strain-state was obtained for Si0.77Ge0.23 layers that did not exhibit the classical cross-hatched pattern morphology while having a threading-dislocations density below 103cm−2. This low dislocation density was confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy. From high resolution transmission electron microscopy observations, the quasi-total strain-relief is assumed to take place by emission of dislocation loops protruding down into the Si substrate from the SiGe/Si interface and terminating at void surfaces of the buried-nanoporous layer. Possible annihilation of dislocation segments coming from either the SiGe/Si interface or punched out in glide planes by overpressurized nanobubbles may also occur. This near surface porous Si is well adapted for multiple junction solar cell manufacturing.

Abstract: The branched TiO2 nanotubes (BTNTs) were synthesized by a combined method of electrospinning, hydrothermal treatment, calcination, and ultrasonic treatment. Various morphologies of BTNTs were obtained by adjusting the hydrothermal temperature or time, and this yielded a morphologically-controllable BTNTs geometry. The CNTs incorporated TiO2 nanorods (CTNRs) were fabricated via a combined method. The novel bilayer photoanodic film made of the CTNRs as an underlayer and the BTNTs as a light-scattering overlayer was fabricated for flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs). With addition of the BTNTs, the conversion efficiency of FDSSCs was greatly enhanced due to the improved light-scattering, the increased dye loading, and the more effective electron collection. The highest conversion efficiency of 4.18% was achieved with the 150°C hydrothermal treatment for 30min, which is nearly twice that of the FDSSCs using single-layer CTNRs film.

Abstract: Histoplasma capsulatum is the causative agent of human histoplasmosis, which can cause respiratory and systemic mycosis in immune-compromised individuals. Lysine acetylation, a protein posttranslational protein modification, is widespread in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Although increasing evidence suggests that lysine acetylation may play critical roles in fungus physiology, very little is known about its extent and function in H. capsulatum. To comprehensively profile protein lysine acetylation in H. capsulatum, we performed a global acetylome analysis through peptide prefractionation, antibody enrichment, and LC−MS/MS analysis, identifying 775 acetylation sites on 456 acetylated proteins; and functionally analysis showing their involvement in different biological processes. We defined six types of acetylation site motifs, and the results imply that lysine residue of polypeptide with tyrosine at the −1 and +1 positions, histidine at the +1 position, and phenylalanine (F) at the +1 and +2 position is a preferred substrate of lysine acetyltransferase. Moreover, some virulence factors candidates including calmodulin and DnaK are acetylated. In conclusion, our data set may serve as an important resource for the elucidation of associations between functional protein lysine acetylation and virulence in H. capsulatum.

Abstract: The purpose of this work is to investigate the performance of a new design concept for a tandem Ce:YAG fluorescent solar concentrator. In this design, elements of Ce:YAG arranged in a hexagonal pattern within a waveguide absorb high energy photons and emit them at an energy optimized for edge-mounted III–V solar cells with a bandgap higher than silicon’s bandgap. A silicon solar cell is located below the waveguide to absorb light transmitted or re-emitted through the concentrator. We first determined the optical properties of single crystal Ce:YAG. These results yielded a peak excitation at 470nm with an absorption coefficient of 25.8cm−1, a peak emission at 530nm with an absorption coefficient of 1.57cm−1; and an internal quantum efficiency of 80.0%. Our experimental analysis using powder Ce:YAG yields a waveguide optical efficiency of 33% for the design excluding focusing lenses and 54% with lenses. There are some sources of error that were addressed by using single crystal Ce:YAG instead of powder. The projected overall FSC efficiency is 15.4% for a tandem fluorescent design using GaP edge-mounted solar cells and a silicon solar cell below the waveguide. This efficiency increases to 19.9% for InGaP edge-mounted cells instead of GaP cells. In both cases single crystal Ce:YAG is assumed.

Abstract: Therapeutic management of liver fibrosis remains an unsolved clinical problem. Hepatic accumulation of extracellular matrix, mainly collagen, is mediated by the production of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). NLRC5, the largest member of the NLR protein family, has recently been identified as a critical regulator of immune responses. Novel evidence shows that NLRC5 is an important negative modulator of inflammatory pathways. Herein, we determined the regulation of NLRC5 in liver fibrogenesis and its underlying mechanisms. We have shown that NLRC5 was upregulated in human liver fibrotic tissues. Overexpression of NLRC5 resulted in an upregulation of collagen 1 and α-smooth muscle actin expression in HSC LX-2 cells, which was inhibited by NLRC5 knockdown with its siRNA. Furthermore, NLRC5 deficiency significantly suppressed TGF-β1-induced proliferation but increased apoptosis (i.e., increased caspases-3, DR4 and DR5) in LX-2 cells. In addition, knockdown of NLRC5 promoted the activation of NF-κB signaling pathways but abrogated phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 proteins in response to TGF-β1. These results indicate that NLRC5 is a potent pro-fibrogenic molecule for HSC activation through TGF-β1/Smad and NF-κB signaling pathways. NLRC5 inhibition would be a promising therapeutic avenue for treating hepatic fibrosis.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Sickle cell disease is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, hemolytic anemia, and intermittent occlusion of small blood vessels, leading to tissue ischemia, chronic organ damage, and organ dysfunction including endocrine organs. The aim of this work was to evaluate some gonadal hormones in female children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in correlation with iron overload.
Methods
This study was conducted on 40 female children with SCA with a serum ferritin of > 1000ng/mL, who were attendants at the Hematology Unit, Pediatric Department, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt in the period from May 2012 to April 2014. Their ages ranged from 11 years to 15years and the mean age value was 12.63±1.36 years (Group I). Forty female children with SCA of matched age with no iron overload served as a control Group (Group II). For all patients in Groups I and II the following were performed/assessed: complete blood count, hemoglobin electrophoresis, serum iron status, serum estrogen, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
Results
There were significantly higher serum ferritin and serum iron levels and significantly lower total iron binding capacity, FSH, LH, and estrogen levels in Group I compared with Group II (mean serum ferritin was 2635.1±918.9 in Group I vs. 292.55±107.2 in Group II with a p value of .001; mean serum iron was 196.3±55.6 in Group I vs. 120±16.57 in Group II with a p value of .001 and mean serum total iron binding capacity was 247.3±28.6 in Group I vs. 327.8.7±21.96 in Group II with a p value of .001; mean FSH level was 1.36±0.22mIU/mL in Group I vs. 2.64±0.81mIU/mL in Group II with a p value of .021; mean LH level was 0.11±0.006mIU/mL in Group I vs. 1.78±1.12mIU/mL in Group II with a p value of .003; mean estrogen level was 21.45±10.23pg/mL in Group I vs. 42.36±15.44pg/mL in Group II with a p value of 0.001) with significant negative correlation between serum gonadal hormones and serum ferritin (r=− .835 and p value of .01 for FSH and serum ferritin; r=− .597 and a p value of .01 for LH and serum ferritin; and r=− 0.624 and p value of .01 for estrogen and serum ferritin.
Conclusion
Female patients with SCA with iron overload may have gonadal hormone deficiency with significant negative correlations between gonadal hormones including FSH, LH, estrogen, and serum ferritin. Recommendations include regular iron chelation for prevention of irreversible damage of the ovaries and attaining normal sexual maturation, and regular follow up for females with SCA with assessment of puberty as they are more vulnerable to develop hypogonadism and may require hormonal replacement therapy.

Abstract: We study a novel architecture for quantum dot (QD) solar cells. While all models and experiments on QD solar cells studied QDs located in the depletion region, we focused on the solar cell structure in which an electron-blocking barrier spatially separates type-II QD absorber from the depletion region. It is important that these QDs are still within the diffusion length from the depletion region. Inter-band QD absorption of the part of solar spectrum with the photon energy less than the energy band gap in the spacers generates a large number of localized excitons in type-II QDs solar cells. The energy of such photons is not utilized in conventional solar cells. However, the proposed architecture enables QD solar cells to benefit from additional photocurrent generated by disintegrating of localized excitons. Hereby we show that hot photoelectron collision with QDs facilitates exciton disintegration. One fifth of solar photons have energy exceeding GaAs bandgap by more than 0.5eV. They generate hot photoelectrons that usually relax by releasing the excess energy to optical phonons in 1ps time scale by multiple electron–phonon scattering. Our study has shown that collisions with QDs may compete with the scattering with optical phonons in GaSb/GaAs type-II QD absorber. The excess energy is transferred to confined holes. Such collisions enable confined holes to escape from QDs into mobile states in the valence band of absorber and dissociate excitons into mobile electrons and holes. Collection of these mobile carriers will increase both photocurrent and conversion efficiency limit of GaAs solar cells by estimated 50%, well above the Shockley–Queisser limit.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 (CZTSSe) thin film solar cells have been prepared by vacuum-based thermal evaporation of metal and binary sulfide precursors followed by annealing in a mixed chalcogen vapor at 550°C for one hour. The Zn/Sn ratio in the precursor was varied from 0.75 to 1.50 keeping the Cu/(Zn+Sn) ratio constant at 0.7. The best performing solar cell was obtained with a final film composition of Cu/(Zn+Sn)=0.77 and Zn/Sn=1.13 corresponding to a Zn/Sn ratio of 0.9 in the precursor. The champion cell exhibited an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 506mV, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 22.92mA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 35% resulting in a total area efficiency (η) of 4.06% without any antireflection coating. Cell performance was found to be limited by high series resistance (RS)=31.1Ω and a low shunt resistance (Rsh)=125.2Ω. No detrimental secondary phases, such as Cu2−xS(Se) or ZnS were detected in the absorber film. Microstructural investigation suggested that small multigrain structure of the CZTSSe absorber layer, presence of an interfacial Mo(S,Se)x blocking barrier, and micro-air-voids at the Mo back contact are the major contributors to the origin of high Rs. Morphological study of the CZTSSe film surface by atomic force microscopy revealed micro-pores that act as low resistance shunt paths and explains the source of such low Rsh. The performance limiting factors of the vacuum based thermally evaporated CZTSSe thin film solar cells are reported.

Abstract: Objective/background
Management of Wilms tumor (WT) in children depends on a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, and outcomes have significantly improved as reported by cooperative group clinical trials. Here, we review the clinical outcomes of patients with WT and identify challenges and barriers encountered in multidisciplinary management outside of cooperative clinical trials.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 35 children with WT treated between April 2002 and June 2013 at the Children’s Cancer Institute in Lebanon.
Results
Upfront resection was performed in 23 cases. Biopsies were performed for Stage V tumors (n=4), those with unresectable tumors or inferior vena caval thrombus (n=5), and patients who had partial surgery performed elsewhere prior to presentation (n=2). One patient died due to toxicity prior to surgery. The tumor was Stage I in eight patients, Stage II in five patients, Stages III and IV in nine patients each, and bilateral (Stage V) in four patients. Adherence to The National Wilms Tumor Study-5 recommendations was adequate. At the time of analysis, 30 patients were free of disease and four patients had relapse—all having metastatic disease initially.
Conclusion
The National Wilms Tumor Study-5 therapy resulted in favorable outcomes in children with nonmetastatic Wilms tumor in the setting of a multidisciplinary approach to therapy and resolution of financial barriers to medical care. Upstaging due to prior intervention and lung radiation therapy to all those with computed tomography-detected lung nodules may both have resulted in overtreatment of a subset of patients. Finally, the relatively high incidence of bilateral tumors suggests the need for further genetic and molecular studies in this patient population.

Abstract: Hybrid solar cells are in sustained development among the photovoltaic (PV) technologies. Molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) is a promising alternative semiconductor for hybrid PV due to its absorption in the near-infrared spectrum, its good carrier transport and its ability to form 2D structures. Scanning Spreading Resistance Microscopy (SSRM) is used for the electrical characterization of crystalline Nb-doped MoSe2. An n-type nature of doping is demonstrated, with local accumulation of dopants in the crystal when substituting Mo atoms by Nb in a 0.01% stoichiometric ratio. On the basis of the SSRM measurements, a band structure for the probe-sample system is proposed. Blends are also prepared with the p-type semiconducting polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the photo-electrical properties of those Nb-doped MoSe2:P3HT systems are studied at the nanoscale by PhotoConductive-Atomic Force Microscopy (PC-AFM).

Abstract: Histone acetylation regulated by class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) plays a pivotal role in matrix-specific gene transcription and cartilage development. While we previously demonstrated that microRNA (miR)-455-3p is upregulated during chondrogenesis and can enhance early chondrogenesis, the mechanism underlying this process remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the effect of miR-455-3p on histone H3 acetylation and its role during cartilage development and degeneration. We observed that miR-455-3p was highly expressed in proliferating and pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes, while HDAC2 and HDAC8 were primarily expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Meanwhile, miR-455-3p suppressed the activity of reporter constructs containing the 3′-untranslated regions of HDAC2/8, inhibited HDAC2/8 expression and promoted histone H3 acetylation at the collagen 2 (COL2A1) promoter in human SW1353 chondrocyte-like cells. Treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in increased expression of cartilage-specific genes and promoted glycosaminoglycan deposition. Moreover, TSA inhibited matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp13) expression and promoted nuclear translocation of SOX9 in interleukin-1-treated primary mouse chondrocytes. Lastly, knockdown of HDAC2/3/8 increased SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9) and decreased Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-455-3p plays a critical role during chondrogenesis by directly targeting HDAC2/8 and promoting histone H3 acetylation, which raises possibilities of using miR-455-3p to influence chondrogenesis and cartilage degeneration.

Abstract: Screen printed front side contacts were investigated in single-crystalline (planar and textured) Si solar cells with n-type emitters, yielding maximum efficiencies of 18.0%. The crystallographic orientation of the Si surface and the paste strongly affect the contact formation as well as the contact resistance of the cells. For textured cells a continuous glass layer together with the formation of Ag colloids yielded a small contact resistance. Planar 〈111〉oriented Si yielded specifically lower contact resistance (〈5mΩcm2) as compared to planar 〈100〉 orientation (〉10–40mΩcm2) for different pastes. Pyramidal Ag crystals are formed only on 〈100〉 oriented Si, whereas lens shaped Ag crystals are grown on 〈111〉surfaces. From this it was concluded that the shape of the Ag nanocrystals determines the contact resistance, pyramidal Ag crystals formed on 〈100〉 planar surfaces yielded cells with large contact resistance and are, therefore, not considered to be necessary for a low contact resistance. Temperature dependent series resistance measurements yielded metallic behavior for cells with the lowest contact resistance bound to a certain paste. For other pastes and processing conditions a semiconducting behavior of the series resistance was found. However, cells with significant density of colloids in the glass layer yielded a small series and contact resistance. By considering the above arguments, a percolation model has been introduced in which metallic Ag colloids generate current filaments across the glass layer. This reduces the resistivity of the glass layer and thereby introduces a percolative nature of the current via Ag nanocolloids. The percolation limit for the 2d case was calculated for periodically arranged colloids with equal size and yields a minimum volume fraction of 15% for the Ag colloids in the glass layer.

Abstract: Hematite is one of the most promising semiconductors used to convert solar irradiation directly into chemical energy (molecular hydrogen and oxygen) via water splitting. Although several methods have been developed in the last decades, the repertoire of a method to fabricate hematite electrodes with a large covered area, relative low cost, industrial viability and remarkable properties still remains a challenge. This paper describes a microwave-assisted hydrothermal process to produce hematite films. The photoelectrodes prepared consisted of rods of hematite on the FTO substrate (FTO-fluorine doped tin oxide) forming mesoporous nanostructured. According to the X-ray diffraction data, thin films thermally treated at high temperature grew preferentially to the [110] direction, i.e., growth perpendicular to the substrate. Moreover, high temperature of thermal treatment influenced positively on the stability, current density and charge transfer efficiency of photoelectrodes. The impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data aided us to understand the best photoelectrochemical performance exhibited by hematite electrode synthesized during 2h with additional thermal treatment at 750°C. The high temperature treatments seem to promote higher ND (charge density) and Vfb values estimated from EIS data, which are related to an efficient photogenerated charge separation (e−−h+). Additionally, our results suggested that the hematite surface roughness and wettability should be considered as important parameters for producing active electrodes for solar water oxidation. A quasi-super hydrophilic surface observed for electrode sintered at high temperature and illustrated by contact angle images could be favoring solid/liquid interface to increase the surface efficiency for chemical reaction. Finally, this work gives a new insight into the role of high temperatures in the sintering process for the activation of pure hematite photoelectrode surface.

Abstract: Health and homoeostasis are maintained by a dynamic balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion. Mitochondrial fusion machinery is largely unknown in mammals. Only a few reports have illustrated the role of Fzo1 in mitochondrial fusion known in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1) interacts with and constitutively ubiquitinates the mammalian homolog, Mitofusin1 (Mfn1) via K63 linkages. In mice models, loss of Mgrn1 function leads to severe developmental defects and adult-onset spongiform neurodegeneration, similar to prion diseases. The tethering of mitochondria to form the ~180kDa Mfn1 complex is independent of MGRN1-mediated ubiquitination. However, successful mitochondrial fusion requires formation of higher oligomers of Mfn1 which in turn needs GTPase activity, intact heptad repeats of Mfn1 and ubiquitination by MGRN1. Following ubiquitination, proteasomal processing of Mfn1 completes the mitochondrial fusion process. This step requires functional p97 activity. These findings suggest a sequence of events where GTPase activity of Mfn1 and tethering of adjacent mitochondria precedes its MGRN1-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation culminating in mitochondrial fusion.

Abstract: This paper reports the design, fabrication and characterization of broadband antireflection coatings for silicon-based solar cells, using a graded-index technique and a novel dual-beam pulsed laser deposition method. A graded refractive index was realized by mixing two different optical materials, silicon and soda-lime glass, in a way that the composition of the mixture changes gradually from silicon (that of the solar cell) to glass (that of the outside protective glass) along the coating thickness direction following pre-designed refractive-index profiles. In this study, two different refractive-index profiles were fabricated, linear and Southwell profiles, on silicon substrates. In order to emulate a protective cover glass for solar-cells, coatings with an additional 400nm-thick outer glass layer were also fabricated. The antireflection coatings showed reflectance of 2.2–5.5% (mostly around 4%) for a wavelength range of 400–1000nm, and for the Southwell profile with a top glass layer, the reflectance was found to be between 2.2% and 4%, which is believed to be close to the theoretically best antireflection performance of a solar cell with a cover glass. Finite-difference time-domain simulations were also performed and the numerical results were in line with the measurement results. Because these coatings are based on silicon and glass and can be fabricated by the one-step pulsed laser deposition procedure, it can simplify the solar-cell structure considerably. The fabricated antireflection coatings may be also used for many other optical applications, such as thin-film optical attenuator and some optical sensors, and the presented pulsed laser deposition method is capable of fabricating a variety of high-performance optical coatings, which cannot be fabricated by other methods.

Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) in biological fluids immediately interact with proteins forming a biomolecular corona (PC) that imparts their biological identity. While several studies on the formation of the PC in human plasma have been reported, the PC of orally administrated NPs has been less investigated, mostly in the presence of a food matrix. In fact, food matrixes when digested are subject of several dynamic changes that will certainly affect the PC formed on the NPs. The lack of studies on this topic is clearly related to the difficulty in isolating representative PC NPs from such a complex environment. In this work magnetite NPs were added to in vitro simulated digestion simultaneously with bread and PC NPs were isolated after gastric and duodenal phases by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (UC). The PC NPs were characterized in terms of size and protein composition. Translocation studies were then performed on Caco-2 monolayers in a serum free environment and cell morphology was characterized by confocal microscopy. PC NPs isolated from gastric and duodenal phases were different in size, surface charge and protein corona composition. NP cellular uptake was enhanced by the digestive PC inducing morphology changes in the cell monolayer. Overall, in this work we were able to isolate PC NPs from digested fluids in the presence of a food matrix and study their biological response on Caco-2 cells.

Abstract: Over the past decade tremendous progress has been made in understanding the functional role of bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) and bitter taste perception. This review will cover the recent advances made in identifying the role of T2Rs in pathophysiological states. T2Rs are widely expressed in various parts of human anatomy and have been shown to be involved in physiology of respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract and endocrine system. Empirical evidence has shown T2Rs to be an integral component of antimicrobial immune responses in upper respiratory tract infections. The studies on human airway smooth muscle cells have shown that a potent bitter tastant induced bronchodilatory effects mediated by bitter taste receptors. Clinical data suggests a role for T2R38 polymorphism in predisposition of individuals to chronic rhinosinusitis. The role of genetic variation in T2Rs and its impact on disease susceptibility have been investigated in various other disease risk factors such as alcohol dependence, head and neck cancers. Preliminary reports have demonstrated differential expression of functional T2Rs in breast cancer cell lines. Studies on the role of T2Rs in pathophysiology of diseases including chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, and cancer have been promising. However, research in this field is in its nascent stages, and more confirmatory studies on animal models and in clinical settings are required.

Abstract: In this work, with Ag alloying, we attempted to improve the microstructure and device performance of low-temperature grown Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells. Ag precursors with various thicknesses are deposited onto Mo prior to the CIGS growth step, and absorber films are formed via a single-step co-evaporation at a substrate temperature of 350°C. The addition of Ag in low-temperature grown CIGS films induces significant recrystallization and Na incorporation. Through adjustment of the Ag content of the Ag-alloyed CIGS films, an improved device performance is obtained compared with a CIGS solar cell without Ag alloying.

Abstract: The protein corona, which immediately is formed after contact of nanoparticles and biological systems, plays a crucial role for the biological fate of nanoparticles. In the here presented study we describe a strategy to control the amount of corona proteins which bind on particle surface and the impact of such a protein corona on particle-cell interactions. For corona formation, polyethyleneimine (PEI) coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) were incubated in a medium consisting of fetal calf serum (FCS) and cell culture medium. To modulate the amount of proteins bind to particles, the composition of the incubation medium was varied with regard to the FCS content. The protein corona mass was estimated and the size distribution of the participating proteins was determined by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). Additionally, the zeta potential of incubated particles was measured. Human blood–brain barrier-representing cell line HBMEC was used for in vitro incubation experiments. To investigate the consequences of the FCS dependent protein corona formation on the interaction of MNP and cells flow cytometry and laser scanning microscopy were used. Zeta potential as well as SDS–PAGE clearly reveal an increase in the amount of corona proteins on MNP with increasing amount of FCS in incubation medium. For MNP incubated with lower FCS concentrations especially medium-sized proteins of molecular weights between 30kDa and 100kDa could be found within the protein corona, whereas for MNP incubated within higher FCS concentrations the fraction of corona proteins of 30kDa and less increased. The presence of the protein corona reduces the interaction of PEI-coated MNP with HBMEC cells within a 30min-incubation.

Abstract: The nociceptive noxious heat-activated receptor - TRPV1, conducts calcium and sodium, thus producing a depolarizing receptor potential, leading to activation of nociceptive neurons. TRPV1-mediated calcium and sodium influx is negatively modulated by calcium, via calcium-dependent desensitization of TRPV1 channels. A mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter - MCU, controls mitochondrial Ca2+ entry while a sodium/calcium transporter - NCLX shapes calcium and sodium transients by mediating sodium entry into and removing calcium from the mitochondria. The functional interplay between TRPV1, MCU and NCLX, in controlling the cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium and sodium transients and subsequently the nociceptive excitability, is poorly understood. Here, we used cytosolic and mitochondrial fluorescent calcium and sodium imaging together with electrophysiological recordings of TRPV1-induced currents in HEK293T cells and nociceptor-like dissociated rat dorsal root ganglion neurons, while modulating NCLX or MCU expression using specific small interfering RNA (siNCLX). We show that the propagation of the TRPV1-induced cytosolic calcium and sodium fluxes into mitochondria is dependent on coordinated activity of NCLX and MCU. Thus, knocking-down of NCLX triggers down regulation of MCU dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. This in turn decreases rate and amplitude of TRPV1-mediated cytosolic calcium, which inhibits capsaicin-induced inward current and neuronal firing. TRPV1-mediated currents were fully rescued by intracellular inclusion of the fast calcium chelator BAPTA. Finally, NCLX controls capsaicin-induced cell death, by supporting massive mitochondrial Ca2+ shuttling. Altogether, our results suggest that NCLX, by regulating cytosolic and mitochondrial ionic transients, modulates calcium-dependent desensitization of TRPV1 channels, thereby, controlling nociceptive signaling.

Abstract: When nanoparticles (NPs) are dispersed in a biofluid, they are covered by a protein corona the composition of which strongly depends on the protein source. Recent studies demonstrated that the type of disease has a crucial role in the protein composition of the NP corona with relevant implications on personalized medicine. Proteomic variations frequently occur in cancer with the consequence that the bio-identity of NPs in the blood of cancer patients may differ from that acquired after administration to healthy volunteers. In this study we investigated the correlation between alterations of plasma proteins in breast, gastric and pancreatic cancer and the biological identity of clinically approved AmBisome-like liposomes as determined by a combination of dynamic light scattering, zeta potential analysis, one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D-SDS-PAGE) and semi-quantitative densitometry. While size of liposome–protein complexes was not significantly different between cancer groups, the hard corona from pancreatic cancer patients was significantly less negatively charged. Of note, the hard corona from pancreatic cancer patients was more enriched than those of other cancer types this enrichment being most likely due to IgA and IgG with possible correlations with the autoantibodies productions in cancer. Given the strict relationship between tumor antigen-specific autoantibodies and early cancer detection, our results could be the basis for the development of novel nanoparticle-corona-based screening tests of cancer.

Luminescence imaging analysis of light harvesting from inactive areas in crystalline silicon PV modules,

Abstract: In a crystalline silicon (Si) wafer based photovoltaic (PV) module, a significant fraction of incoming photons falls onto the inactive areas of the module that do not generate electrical carriers (e.g. metal fingers, interconnection ribbons, cell spacing etc.). However, some of those photons can still be harvested via optical scattering at the inactive area and subsequent internal reflection at the glass–air interface, thereby contributing to the module’s output power. We propose a method using luminescence imaging to characterize the light harvesting from the inactive area in crystalline Si PV modules. By exploiting the reciprocity theorem relating luminescence emission to external quantum efficiency (EQE), a relative EQE map is extracted from a luminescence image of a PV module. The light harvesting efficiency at the different inactive areas can thus be directly quantified. For example in this paper, we apply the method to extract the light harvesting efficiency of two different backsheets (i.e. a white backsheet and a scattering tape) and of metal fingers (by screen and stencil printing) in one-cell mini-modules. We show that photons impinging on the white and the scattering tape backsheet close to the solar cell edges have a 20% and a 45% chance, respectively, to be harvested. Similarly, about 60% of the photons impinging on the metal fingers can be harvested. Furthermore, we estimate the enhancement of the effective active area in a typical multicrystalline Si PV module (2.1% due to the metal fingers, 0.2% due to the ribbons, 1.5% due to the white backsheet and 3.2% due to the scattering tape respectively) as well as the corresponding short-circuit current enhancement (0.20A, 0.02A, 0.13A and 0.29A, respectively).

Biased signalling is an essential feature of TLR4 in glioma cells,

Abstract: A distinct feature of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is its ability to trigger both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent signalling, culminating in activation of pro-inflammatory NF-κB and/or the antiviral IRF3. Although TLR4 agonists (lipopolysaccharides; LPSs) derived from different bacterial species have different endotoxic activity, the impact of LPS chemotype on the downstream signalling is not fully understood. Notably, different TLR4 agonists exhibit anti-tumoural activity in animal models of glioma, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Thus, we investigated the impact of LPS chemotype on the signalling events in the human glioma cell line U251. We found that LPS of Escherichia coli origin (LPSEC) leads to NF-κB-biased downstream signalling compared to Salmonella minnesota-derived LPS (LPSSM). Exposure of U251 cells to LPSEC resulted in faster nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65, higher NF-κB-activity and expression of its targets genes, and higher amount of secreted IL-6 compared to LPSSM. Using super-resolution microscopy we showed that the biased agonism of TLR4 in glioma cells is neither a result of differential regulation of receptor density nor of formation of higher order oligomers. Consistent with previous reports, LPSEC-mediated NF-κB activation led to significantly increased U251 proliferation, whereas LPSSM-induced IRF3 activity negatively influenced their invasiveness. Finally, treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) selectively increased LPSSM-induced nuclear translocation of p65 and NF-κB activity without affecting IRF3. Our data may explain how TLR4 agonists differently affect glioma cell proliferation and migration.

Abstract: Si is an excellent absorber material for use in photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen production. Only a few studies have been done using Si in alkaline electrolyte for hydrogen evolution due to its poor chemical stability in high pH electrolyte, indicating that a chemically stable protection layer is essential. Here we investigate thin TiO2 films deposited by high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) as a protection layer for a p-type silicon photocathode for photoelectrochemical H2 evolution in a high pH electrolyte. The X-ray reflectometry analysis reveals that the HiPIMS process provides improved film density for TiO2 films (4.15g/cm3), and consequently results in a significantly less corroded Si surface. The Si photocathode protected by the HiPIMS grown TiO2 film along with Pt as co-catalyst produced a photocurrent onset potential of ~0.5V vs. RHE in 1M KOH and showed a 4% decay over 24h in KOH. In contrast, the sample with the TiO2 deposited using conventional DC sputtering technique of similar thickness shows 20% loss in photocurrent for the same time interval. Considering the fact that the experiments were carried out not in the cleanroom, much less corrosion loss can be obtained if done in dust-free condition. Hence, these results suggest the HiPIMS technique as an improved approach for the protection of photoelectrodes, which are unstable in alkaline solution.

Dehydroepiandrosterone ameliorates H2O2-induced Leydig cells oxidation damage and apoptosis through inhibition of ROS production and activation of PI3K/Akt pathways,

Abstract: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is widely used as a nutritional supplement, and administration of DHEA produces a number of beneficial effects in the elderly. Many researchers have suggested that DHEA exerts it function after conversion into more biologically active hormones in peripheral target cells. The actions of DHEA in Leydig cells, a major target cell of DHEA biotransformation in males, are not clear. The present study found that DHEA increased cell viability and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde contents in H2O2-induced Leydig cells. DHEA significantly increased the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase, and decreased the DNA damage in H2O2-induced Leydig cells. Apoptosis was significant decreased in H2O2-induced Leydig cells after DHEA treatment. DHEA inhibited the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and the upregulation of the caspase-3 protein level induced by H2O2 in Leydig cells. DHEA also reversed the decrease in PI3K and p-Akt protein levels induced by H2O2. These data showed that DHEA could ameliorate H2O2-induced oxidative damage by increasing anti-oxidative enzyme activities, which resulted in reduced ROS content, and decreased apoptosis, mainly by preventing the loss of ΔΨm and inhibiting caspase-3 protein levels via activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. These results increase our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the anti-ageing effect of DHEA.

Abstract: The use of photon conversion layers is an interesting way to improve the overall efficiency of solar cells. Herein we report on Nd-doped SnO2 thin films with photon management property inserted further into CIGS based solar cells. The functionalized layers were deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering whose structural, optical and electrical properties were tuned by varying the deposition temperature. Careful analysis of the structure using XRD and XPS showed that the tetragonal rutile SnO2 phase can be obtained at a deposition temperature as low as 100°C. Transparency was found to be as high as 90% for all layers while the absorption edge is found to increase when increasing the deposition temperature up to 300°C. The photoluminescence measurements under 325nm UV laser excitation showed that 100°C is needed for the optical activation of the rare earth. Despite the small amounts of Nd (around 0.62at%), intense and narrow emission bands have been collected in the Near Infrared Region (NIR) which are characteristics of Nd3+ ions whose the ionic state was confirmed by the 3d XPS core levels. Thus, the emission spectra cover a good part of the spectrum useful to the solar cell. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy experiments were also carried out on Nd:SnO2 samples to get insights on the energy transfer. By exciting in the deep UV from 250 to 400nm intense Nd emission was collected giving an experimental evidence of the down-shifting process through a resonant energy transfer from the SnO2 host matrix to the Nd3+ ions. Hall Effect measurements showed that the n-type character and good conductivity of the Nd doped SnO2 films can be correlated to the highest optical activity of Nd in the matrix. An optimal condition is found for the Nd-doped SnO2 film grown at 300°C for which the highest PL and the best electrical data were measured. Finally, we show that the implementation of such optimized Nd–SnO2 films on CIGS based solar cells serving as a transparent conducting oxide and a down shifting converter results in the best power conversion efficiency.

Abstract: Three types of carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been investigated regarding their suitability as spectrally selective solar thermal absorbers. The CNT coatings were electrophoretically deposited on aluminum substrates using kinetically stable CNT aqueous suspensions, of which two CNT aqueous suspensions (N-CNT and P-CNT suspensions) were prepared as part of this study and the third one (T-CNT suspension) was purchased. The CNT suspension systems are simple and consist of only CNTs, DI water and a cathodic surfactant. Heat treated CNT coatings are visibly uniform. The CNT coating thickness, surface morphology and reflectance of CNT absorbers were characterized by White Light Interferometry, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Spectrophotometry, respectively. T-CNT absorber achieved a solar absorptance α of 0.79 and a thermal emittance ε of 0.14. N- and P-CNT absorbers achieved better spectral selectivity, with α=0.90 and ε=0.14 for N-CNT absorber, α=0.90 and ε=0.13 for P-CNT absorber. The effect of CNT coating thickness, deposition parameters and peak heat treatment temperature on the spectral selectivity were studied. For these CNT suspension systems, the thickness and the heat treatment peak temperature are the key factors to achieving a good spectral selectivity.

Abstract: In order for OPV devices to transition from the laboratory to the industrial scale, accurate measurements of device operating stability and lifetime are crucial. This paper compares the degradation of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:ICBA/Ca/Al and ITO/MoO3/P3HT:ICBA/Ca/Al devices using the three main ISOS standard testing protocols: (a) ISOS-D-1, (b) ISOS-O-1 and (c) ISOS-L-1. We show that: (1) ITO/MoO3/P3HT:ICBA/Ca/Al devices are more stable than their PEDOT counterparts under the ISOS-D-1 protocol, as has been reported previously. (2) Under the ISOS-O-1 protocol, unencapsulated MoO3 based devices are more stable than the equivalent PEDOT device but, when encapsulated, the degradation rates of the MoO3 and PEDOT devices are the same. (3) By contrast, when measured under the ISOS-L protocol, the MoO3 based devices are either equivalent to (unencapsulated devices) or, indeed, actually degrade faster (encapsulated devices) that their PEDOT counterparts. We demonstrate that these differences arise from the dominant degradation mode changing under the different protocols. As such, this paper highlights that the choice of testing protocol significantly influences the reported stability of OPV devices. In particular, the ISOS-D and ISOS-L protocols do not necessary reflect OPV device performance under actual operating conditions and thus stability measurements using these protocols should be treated with caution.

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) act as a relay center through which extracellular signals, in the form of neurotransmitters or therapeutics, are converted into an intracellular response, which ultimately shapes the overall response at the tissue and behavioral level. Remarkably in similar ways, epigenetic mechanisms also modulate the expression pattern of a large number of genes in response to the dynamic environment inside and outside of the body, and consequently overall response. Emerging evidences from the pharmacogenomics and preclinical studies clearly suggest that these two distinct mechanisms criss-cross each other in several neurological disorders. At one hand such cross-talks between two distinct mechanisms make disease etiology more challenging to understand, while on the other hand if dealt appropriately, such situations might provide an opportunity to find novel druggable target and strategy for the treatment of complex diseases. In this review article, we have summarized and highlighted the main findings that tie epigenetic mechanisms to GPCR mediated signaling in the pathophysiology of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including depression, addiction and pain.

Abstract: Nuclear factor κB is a key mediator of inflammation during conditions of hypoxia. Here, we used models of hypoxic pre-conditioning as mechanism to decrease nuclear factor κB activity induced by hypoxia. Our initial studies suggested that Disrupted in Schizophrenia-1 may be induced by hypoxic pre-conditioning and possibly involved in the regulation of nuclear factor κB. In this study we used Disrupted in Schizophrenia-1 exogenous over-expression and knock-down to determine its effect on ataxia telangiectasia mutated – nuclear factor κB activation cascade. Our results demonstrated that hypoxic pre-conditioning significantly increased the expression of Disrupted in Schizophrenia-1 at mRNA and protein levels both in vitro and in vivo. Over-expression of Disrupted in Schizophrenia-1 significantly attenuated the hypoxia-mediated ataxia telangiectasia mutated phosphorylation and prevented its cytoplasm translocation where it functions to activate nuclear factor κB. We further determined that Disrupted in Schizophrenia-1 activated the protein phosphatase 2A, preventing the phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated serine-1981, the main regulatory site of ataxia telangiectasia mutated activity. Cellular levels of Disrupted in Schizophrenia-1 protein significantly decreased nuclear factor κB activation profiles and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that hypoxic pre-conditioning decreases the activation of nuclear factor κB through the transcriptional induction of Disrupted in Schizophrenia-1.

Abstract: CeO2 and hydrogen co-doped In2O3 (ICO:H) films deposited by ion plating with dc arc-discharge were used as a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) electrode in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/crystalline silicon (c-Si) heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. Incorporating ICO:H instead of conventional Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) films and hydrogenated In2O3 (IO:H) films, improved the fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) simultaneously. The best SHJ cell (243.4cm2) containing ICO:H films had a conversion efficiency of 24.1%, open-circuit voltage of 745mV, Jsc of 38.8mA/cm2, and FF of 83.2% because of their high Hall mobility of 140cm2/Vs. We have clarified the following design principles for ICO:H films: (i) the Ce species substituted for In atoms acts as a donor and (ii) CeO2 and H decrease the residual strain and the contribution of the grain boundary scattering to carrier transport. This co-doping method can produce high conversion efficiencies in all solar cells containing TCO with resistive emitters.

Abstract: Various toxic compounds produce reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative stress that threatens cellular homeostasis. Yet, lower doses of stress can stimulate defence systems allowing cell survival, whereas intense stress activates cell death pathways such as apoptosis. Mild thermal stress (40°C, 3h) induces thermotolerance, an adaptive survival response that renders cells less sensitive to subsequent toxic stress, by activating defence systems like heat shock proteins, antioxidants, anti-apoptotic and ER-stress factors. This study aims to understand how autophagy and apoptosis are regulated in response to different doses of H2O2, and whether mild thermotolerance can protect cervical carcinoma cells against apoptosis by stimulating autophagy. Autophagy was monitored through Beclin-1 and LC3 expression and acid compartment activity, whereas apoptosis was tracked by caspase activity and chromatin condensation. Exposure of HeLa and C33 A cells to H2O2 for shorter times (15–30min) transiently induced autophagy; apoptosis was activated after longer times (1−3h). Mild thermotolerance at 40°C enhanced activation of autophagy by H2O2. Disruption of autophagy using bafilomycin A1 and 3-methyladenine sensitised cells to apoptosis induced by H2O2, in non-thermotolerant cells and, to a lesser extent, in thermotolerant cells. Inhibition of autophagy enhanced apoptosis through the mitochondrial, death receptor and endoplasmic reticulum pathways. Autophagy was activated by lower doses of stress and protects cells against apoptosis induced by higher doses of H2O2. This work improves understanding of mechanisms that might be involved in toxicity of various compounds and could eventually lead to protective strategies against deleterious effects of toxic compounds.

Abstract: Recent developments in organic photovoltaic technology demonstrate the possibility of easily printable, light, thin, and flexible solar panels with fast manufacturing times. Prior life-cycle assessment studies show potential for organic photovoltaics to lower the environmental footprint and shorten the energy and carbon payback times compared to conventional silicon during the production of a solar cell on a watt-for-watt basis. This study extends such analyses beyond the manufacturing stage and evaluates the prospective cradle-to-grave life-cycle impacts of organic photovoltaics compared with conventional ones. Two systems (solar rooftop array and portable solar charger) were chosen to illustrate how different product integrations, duration of use and disposal routes influence potential environmental benefits of organic photovoltaics while informing researchers on the prospects for continued development and scaling-up this technology. The results of the life-cycle assessment showed that environmental benefits for organic photovoltaics extend beyond the manufacture of the photovoltaic panels, with baseline cradle-to-grave impacts for both long-term uses (rooftop arrays) and short-term uses (portable chargers) on average 55% and 70% lower than silicon devices, respectively. These results demonstrate that further reductions can be leveraged by integrating organic photovoltaics into simpler devices that take advantage of their flexibility and ability to be used in applications that are less constrained by conventional technology. For example, organic photovoltaic charging units showed life-cycle impacts more than 39–89% lower than silicon along with energy and carbon payback times as short as 220 and 118 days, respectively.

Abstract: A comprehensive study was carried out to understand the influence of organic cations on high-performance CH3NH3PbI3 based photovoltaics. Scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffractometer, Hall measurement, absorbance spectrum, photoluminescence (PL) spectrum and nanosecond time-resolved PL measurements were used to explore the structural, electrical, optical and excitonic characteristics of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films fabricated under different thermal annealing temperatures from 60°C to 140°C. The decrease in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) with an increase in the thermal annealing temperature can be explained as due to the reduced work function of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. The short-circuit current density (JSC) of the CH3NH3PbI3 based photovoltaics is dependent on the efficiencies of light absorption and carrier collection, which results in an optimized JSC when the thermal annealing temperature is 120°C. The atomistic interaction between the organic cations and Pb–I framework strongly influences the absorbance of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films, as confirmed by the libration of CH3NH3 cations shown by Raman scattering spectroscopy. In addition, the experimental results indicate that the power conversion efficiency can be further improved when the absorption strength of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film and the energy-level alignment of each photovoltaic layer are simultaneously fulfilled.

Abstract: Planar perovskite solar cells with a p–i–n structure use both hole-transport layers and electron-transport layers to promote collection of photogenerated holes and electrons for achieving high performance, wherein a high temperature processed compact and mesoporous titanium dioxide are usually required. We report here efficient perovskite solar cells grown directly on ultraviolet–ozone treated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates without using any electron-transport layers. The morphology, structure, optical–electrical properties of perovskite films deposited on FTO substrates with and without ultraviolet–ozone treatment and their corresponding devices׳ performance have been studied and compared. Ultraviolet–ozone treatment of FTO substrates improves the smoothness and coverage of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films, which avoids direct contact between FTO and hole-transport layer. A planar electron-transport layer free device with a power conversion efficiency of over 10% has been achieved, suggesting that the widely adopted electron-transport layer is not a requirement for an efficient device.

Abstract: A simple strategy, based on the Al-doped ZnO nanorods (NRs), to get an antireflective, self-cleanable and electrical conductive window layer for the thin film solar cell was demonstrated. The length and diameter of Al-doped ZnO NRs were optimized by controlling Al precursor concentration and growth time and an average reflectance of 2.9% was achieved. Al-doped ZnO NRs simultaneously having the rugged surface morphology with the micrometer- and nanometer-scale roughness also exhibited superhydrophobicity and extremely small water contact angle (WCA) hysteresis below Δ1° after treatment of hydrophobic self-assembled monolayer (SAM). Finally, in spite of the existence of the SAM, the enhancement of the electrical contact with silver from Schottky to Ohmic for various Al doping concentrations was confirmed. Self-cleanable and electrically conductive antireflecting layer introduced in this work would be expected to increase photovoltaic efficiency in a thin film solar cell.

Abstract: We report here the synthesis and characterization of a series of p-type copolymers, which combine a fluorinated quinoxaline (FQ) acceptor unit either with a differently substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) or an unsubstituted thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT). The effect of the structural modifications on the photochemical stability of the resulting films is investigated and then correlated with the photovoltaic performance and lifetime measurements of corresponding photovolatic devices. To this end, we firstly studied the intrinsic stability of each polymer film by monitoring the UV–vis absorption decay, under simulated sunlight, as a function of ageing time. Bulk heterojunction solar cells, based on these polymers as donor materials, were fabricated and tested. Beside the initial values, we monitored the photovoltaic performance during prolonged light soaking in order to evaluate and compare the photostability of more complex systems such as working solar cells.
