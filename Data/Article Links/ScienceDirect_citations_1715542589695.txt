Abstract: Glucocorticoids(GCs) are extensively used to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Excessive prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis. The inhibition of osteoblast differentiation by GCs is suggested as a major cause for GCs-induced osteoporosis (GIO). However, the precise mechanism underlying the role of GCs in osteoblasts differentiation is not fully elucidated. Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), a secreted member of the Semaphorin family, enhances bone formation and promotes fracture healing, which is known to increase osteoblastic differentiation and stimulate osteogenesis in bone metabolism. Here, the present study explored the effect of Sema3A in osteoblast differentiation using dexamethasone (Dex) treatment of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Dex treatment decreased Sema3A expression in BMSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Dex stimulation suppressed the differentiation of osteoblasts by reducing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteoblastic marker genes expression and mineralization, but all of these effects were ameliorated by exogenous recombinant Sema3A administration. Furthermore, exogenous Sema3A administration reversed the Dex-mediated decrease in nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and β-catenin activity in BMSCs. Meanwhile, Dex was capable of simultaneously suppressing the phosphorylation of protein kinase B(Akt) and the expression level of Sema3A in BMSCs. These changes were significantly abolished by the PI3K/Akt agonist. These results suggest that Dex inhibits osteoblast differentiation by suppressing Sema3A expression via the PI3K/Akt pathway. These data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Dex-induced osteoblast differentiation inhibition.

Abstract: Fractalkine (FKN) is a chemokine with several roles, including chemotaxis; adhesion; and immune damage, which also participates in cell inflammation and apoptosis and responds to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Given the involvement of regulatory T cells (Treg) cells in autoimmune diseases, this study investigated the regulatory mechanism of FKN in renal injury and Treg apoptosis via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) signaling pathway in lupus-prone mice. Lupus was induced in BALB/c female mice by injection of pristane, followed by isolation of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells from the spleen of lupus model mice. To deplete FKN, mice received injection of an anti-FKN antibody, and Treg cells were transfected with FKN small-interfering RNA. Lupus mice and Treg cells were treated with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and activator U-46619, respectively, and urine protein and serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, and autoantibodies were measured and renal histopathological changes analyzed. We determined levels of FKN, phosphorylated p38 (p-p38), and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) in renal tissue and Treg cells, and analyzed apoptosis rates and levels of key apoptotic factors in Treg cells. The renal FKN and p-p38 levels increased, whereas renal FOXP3 level decreased in lupus-prone mice. Treatment with the anti-FKN antibody and the p38MAPK inhibitor ameliorated proteinuria and renal function, significantly reducing serum autoantibody, renal FKN, and p-p38 levels while increasing renal FOXP3 level in lupus-prone mice. Moreover, FKN knockdown and administration of the p38MAPK inhibitor reduced apoptosis and levels of pro-apoptotic factors, increased levels of anti-apoptotic factors, and suppressed activation of p38MAPK signaling in Treg cells derived from lupus model mice. Furthermore, treatment with the p38MAPK activator U-46619 had the opposite effect on these cells. These data indicated that depletion of FKN ameliorated renal injury and Treg cell apoptosis via inhibition of p38MAPK signaling in lupus nephritis, suggesting that targeting FKN represents a potential therapeutic strategy for treating Lupus nephritis.

Abstract: Summary
Vitamin E exhibits pharmacological effects beyond established antioxidant activity suggesting involvement of unidentified mechanisms. Here, we characterize endogenously formed tocopherol carboxylates and the vitamin E mimetic garcinoic acid (GA) as activators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). Co-stimulation of PPARγ with GA and the orthosteric agonist pioglitazone resulted in additive transcriptional activity. In line with this, the PPARγ-GA complex adopted a fully active conformation and interestingly contained two bound GA molecules with one at an allosteric site. A co-regulator interaction scan demonstrated an unanticipated co-factor recruitment profile for GA-bound PPARγ compared with canonical PPARγ agonists and gene expression analysis revealed different effects of GA and pioglitazone on PPAR signaling in hepatocytes. These observations reveal allosteric mechanisms of PPARγ modulation as an alternative avenue to PPARγ targeting and suggest contributions of PPARγ activation by α-13-tocopherolcarboxylate to the pharmacological effects of vitamin E.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration and genetic forms of blindness such as Best Disease and Retinitis Pigmentosa can be caused by degeneration of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE). RPE generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is valuable for both the study of disease mechanisms and development of therapeutic strategies. However, protocols to produce iPSC-derived RPE in vitro are often inefficient, labor-intensive, low-throughput, and highly variable between cell lines and within batches. Here, we report a robust, scalable method to generate iPSC-RPE using doxycycline-inducible expression of eye field transcription factors OTX2, PAX6 and MITF paired with RPE-permissive culture media. Doxycycline addition induces exogenous expression of these transcription factors in Best Disease patient- and wildtype iPSCs to efficiently produce monolayers of RPE with characteristic morphology and gene expression. Further, these RPE monolayers display functionality features including light absorption via pigmentation, polarity-driven fluid transport, and phagocytosis. With this method, we achieve a highly efficient and easily scalable differentiation without the need for mechanical isolation or enrichment methods, generating RPE cultures applicable for in vitro studies.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 immunity is critical for overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and informing vaccination strategies. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics over 10 months in 963 individuals who predominantly experienced mild COVID-19. Investigating 2,146 samples, we initially detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 94.4% of individuals, with 82% and 79% exhibiting serum and IgG neutralization, respectively. Approximately 3% of individuals demonstrated exceptional SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, with these “elite neutralizers” also possessing SARS-CoV-1 cross-neutralizing IgG. Multivariate statistical modeling revealed age, symptomatic infection, disease severity, and gender as key factors predicting SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing activity. A loss of reactivity to the virus spike protein was observed in 13% of individuals 10 months after infection. Neutralizing activity had half-lives of 14.7 weeks in serum versus 31.4 weeks in purified IgG, indicating a rather long-term IgG antibody response. Our results demonstrate a broad spectrum in the initial SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody response, with sustained antibodies in most individuals for 10 months after mild COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cells cultured in 2D micropatterns with BMP4 differentiate into a radial arrangement of germ layers and extraembryonic cells. Single-cell transcriptomes demonstrate generation of cell types transcriptionally similar to their in vivo counterparts in Carnegie stage 7 human gastrula. Time-course analyses indicate sequential differentiation, where the epiblast arises by 12 h between the prospective ectoderm in the center and the cells initiating differentiation toward extraembryonic fates at the edge. Extraembryonic and mesendoderm precursors arise from the epiblast by 24 h, while nascent mesoderm, endoderm, and primordial germ cell-like cells form by 44 h. Dynamic changes in transcripts encoding signaling components support a BMP, WNT, and Nodal hierarchy underlying germ-layer specification conserved across mammals, and FGF and HIPPO pathways being active throughout differentiation. This work also provides a resource for mining genes and pathways expressed in a stereotyped 2D gastruloid model, common with other species or unique to human gastrulation.

Abstract: Summary
Recently, a new wave of synthetic embryo systems (SESs) has been established from cultured cells for efficient and ethical embryonic development research. We recently reported our epiblast stem cell (EPISC) reprogramming SES that generates numerous blastocyst (BC)-like hemispheres (BCLH) with pluripotent and extraembryonic cell features detected by microscopy. Here, we further explored the system over key time points with single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. We found broad induction of the 2C-like reporter MERVL and RNA velocities diverging to three major cell populations with gene expression profiles resembling those of pluripotent epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm. Enrichment of those three induced BC-like cell fates involved key gene-regulatory networks, zygotic genome activation-related genes, and specific RNA splicing, and many cells closely resembled in silico models. This analysis confirms the induction of extraembryonic cell populations during EPISC reprogramming. We anticipate that our unique BCLH SES and rich dataset may uncover new facets of cell potency, improve developmental biology, and advance biomedicine.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is a key member of the HSP family that contributes to a pre-cancerous environment; however, its role in lung cancer remains poorly understood. The present study used geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) to induce HSP70 expression, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) was used to construct an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) model by stimulating A549 cells in vitro. Western Blot was performed to detect protein levels of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and the EMT-associated proteins E-cadherin and vimentin both before and after HSP70 expression. Cell morphological changes were observed, and the effect of HSP70 on cell migration ability was detected via the wound healing. The results demonstrated that GGA at 50 and 200 μmol/L could significantly induce HSP70 expression in A549 cells (P < 0.05). Furthermore, HSP70 induced by 200 μmol/L GGA significantly inhibited the changes of E-cadherin, vimentin, and cell morphology induced by TGF-β (P < 0.05), while HSP70 induced by 50 μmol/L GGA did not. The results of the wound healing assay indicated that 200 μmol/L GGA significantly inhibited A549 cell migration induced by TGF-β. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that overexpression of HSP70 inhibited the TGF-β induced EMT process and changed the cell morphology and migratory ability induced by TGF-β in A549 cells.

Abstract: Summary
The lack of effective treatment options for advanced non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (NCCRCC) is a critical unmet clinical need. Applying a high-throughput drug screen to multiple human kidney cancer cells, we identify the combination of the VEGFR-MET inhibitor cabozantinib and the SRC inhibitor dasatinib acts synergistically in cells to markedly reduce cell viability. Importantly, the combination is well tolerated and causes tumor regression in vivo. Transcriptional and phosphoproteomic profiling reveals that the combination converges to downregulate the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway, a result not predicted by single-agent analysis alone. Correspondingly, the addition of a MEK inhibitor synergizes with either dasatinib or cabozantinib to increase its efficacy. This study, by using approved, clinically relevant drugs, provides the rationale for the design of effective combination treatments in NCCRCC that can be rapidly translated to the clinic.

Abstract: During orthodontic treatment, mechanical stretch serves a crucial function in osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). Up-regulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) level is a result of cyclic mechanical stretch in many cell types. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a master regulator in various antioxidants expression. However, it is not known whether cyclic mechanical stretch could induce the ROS generation in PDLSCs and whether Nrf2 participated in this process. The present study was aimed to investigate the role of Nrf2 in PDLSCs under cyclic mechanical stretch. Our results showed that cyclic mechanical stretch increased ROS level and the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 during osteoblast differentiation. Knocking down Nrf2 by siRNA transfection increased ROS formation and suppressed osteogenic differentiation in PDLSCs. T-BHQ, a Nrf2 activator, promoted the osteogenic differentiation in PDLSCs under cyclic mechanical stretch, and improved the microstructure of alveolar bone during orthodontic tooth movement in rats by employing micro-CT system. Taken together, Nrf2 activation was involved in osteogenic differentiation under cyclic mechanical stretch in PDLSCs. T-BHQ could promote the osteogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a promising option for the remodeling of the alveolar bone during orthodontic tooth movement.

Abstract: Summary
Non-muscle myosin IIA plays an important role in cell adhesion, cell migration, and tissue architecture. We previously showed that low activity of the heavy chain of non-muscle myosin II Myh9 is beneficial to LGR5+ intestinal stem cell maintenance. However, the function of Myh9 in adult mouse intestinal epithelium is largely unclear. In this study, we used the inducible Villin-creERT2 knockout approach to delete Myh9 in adult mouse intestinal epithelium and observed that homozygous deletion of Myh9 causes colitis-like morphologic changes in intestine, leads to a high sensitivity to dextran sulfate sodium and promotes colitis-related adenoma formation in the colon. Myh9 deletion disturbs cell junctions and impairs intestinal lumen barrier integrity, promoting the necroptosis of epithelial cells. Consistently, these changes can be partially rescued by Ripk3 knockout. Our results indicate that Myh9 is required for the maintenance of intestinal epithelium integrity and the prevention of cell necroptosis.

Abstract: Summary
The capacity of antibodies to engage with immune cells via the Fc region is important in preventing and controlling many infectious diseases. The evolution of such antibodies during convalescence from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is largely unknown. We develop assays to measure Fc-dependent antibody functions against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S)-expressing cells in serial samples from subjects primarily with mild-moderate COVID-19 up to 149 days post-infection. We find that S-specific antibodies capable of engaging Fcγ receptors decay over time, with S-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) activity within plasma declining accordingly. Although there is significant decay in ADCC and ADP activity, they remain readily detectable in almost all subjects at the last time point studied (94%) in contrast with neutralization activity (70%). Although it remains unclear the degree to which Fc effector functions contribute to protection against SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, our results indicate that antibodies with Fc effector functions persist longer than neutralizing antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
How helminths influence the pathogenesis of sexually transmitted viral infections is not comprehensively understood. Here, we show that an acute helminth infection (Nippostrongylus brasiliensis [Nb]) induced a type 2 immune profile in the female genital tract (FGT). This leads to heightened epithelial ulceration and pathology in subsequent herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 infection. This was IL-5-dependent but IL-4 receptor alpha (Il4ra) independent, associated with increased FGT eosinophils, raised vaginal IL-33, and enhanced epithelial necrosis. Vaginal eosinophil accumulation was promoted by IL-33 induction following targeted vaginal epithelium damage from a papain challenge. Inhibition of IL-33 protected against Nb-exacerbated HSV-2 pathology. Eosinophil depletion reduced IL-33 release and HSV-2 ulceration in Nb-infected mice. These findings demonstrate that Nb-initiated FGT eosinophil recruitment promotes an eosinophil, IL-33, and IL-5 inflammatory circuit that enhances vaginal epithelial necrosis and pathology following HSV-2 infection. These findings identify a mechanistic framework as to how helminth infections can exacerbate viral-induced vaginal pathology.

Abstract: The cytoophidium, a subcellular structure composed of CTP synthase, can be observed during the division of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Cytoophidium formation changes periodically with the cell cycle of yeast cells. Here, we find that histone chaperone Slm9 is required for the integrity of cytoophidia in fission yeast. When the slm9 gene is knocked out, we observe that morphological characteristics, the abundance of cytoophidia and the division of the yeast cells are significantly affected. Fragmented cytoophidia occur in slm9 mutant cells, a phenomenon rarely observed in wild-type cells. Our study reveals a potential link between a chromosomal regulatory factor and cytoophidium biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a new technology to degrade target proteins. However, their clinical application is limited currently by lack of chemical binders to target proteins. For instance, it is still unknown whether splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) is targetable by PROTACs. We recently identified a 2-aminothiazole derivative (herein O4I2) as a promoter in the generation of human pluripotent stem cells. In this work, proteomic analysis on the biotinylated O4I2 revealed that O4I2 targeted SF3B1 and positively regulated RNA splicing. Fusing thalidomide—the ligand of the cereblon ubiquitin ligase—to O4I2 led to a new PROTAC-O4I2, which selectively degraded SF3B1 and induced cellular apoptosis in a CRBN-dependent manner. In a Drosophila intestinal tumor model, PROTAC-O4I2 increased survival by interference with the maintenance and proliferation of stem cell. Thus, our finding demonstrates that SF3B1 is PROTACable by utilizing noninhibitory chemicals, which expands the list of PROTAC target proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying lineage-specific markers is pivotal for understanding developmental processes and developing cell therapies. Here, we investigated the functioning of a cardiomyogenic cell-surface marker, latrophilin-2 (LPHN2), an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor, in cardiac differentiation. LPHN2 was selectively expressed in cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) and cardiomyocytes (CMCs) during mouse and human pluripotent stem cell (PSC) differentiation; cell sorting with an anti-LPHN2 antibody promoted the isolation of populations highly enriched in CPCs and CMCs. Lphn2 knockdown or knockout PSCs did not express cardiac genes. We used the Phospho Explorer Antibody Array, which encompasses nearly all known signaling pathways, to assess molecular mechanisms underlying LPHN2-induced cardiac differentiation. LPHN2-dependent phosphorylation was the strongest for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) at Tyr15. We identified CDK5, Src, and P38MAPK as key downstream molecules of LPHN2 signaling. These findings provide a valuable strategy for isolating CPCs and CMCs from PSCs and insights into the still-unknown cardiac differentiation mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lower blood oxygen levels, even in patients without hypoxia requiring hospitalization. This discordance illustrates the need for a more unifying explanation as to whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects erythropoiesis. Here, we show significantly enriched CD71+ erythroid precursors/progenitors in the blood circulation of COVID-19 patients. We found that these cells have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. In agreement, we observed a strong negative correlation between the frequency of these cells with T and B cell proportions in COVID-19 patients. The expansion of these CD71+ erythroid precursors/progenitors was negatively correlated with the hemoglobin levels. A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45+ CD71+ cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, and CD26, and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. This provides a novel insight into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on erythropoiesis and hypoxia seen in COVID-19 patients.

Abstract: Summary
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a 20A > T mutation in the β-globin gene. Genome-editing technologies have the potential to correct the SCD mutation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), producing adult hemoglobin while simultaneously eliminating sickle hemoglobin. Here, we developed high-efficiency viral vector-free non-footprint gene correction in SCD CD34+ cells with electroporation to deliver SCD mutation-targeting guide RNA, Cas9 endonuclease, and 100-mer single-strand donor DNA encoding intact β-globin sequence, achieving therapeutic-level gene correction at DNA (∼30%) and protein (∼80%) levels. Gene-edited SCD CD34+ cells contributed corrected cells 6 months post-xenograft mouse transplant without off-target δ-globin editing. We then developed a rhesus β-to-βs-globin gene conversion strategy to model HSC-targeted genome editing for SCD and demonstrate the engraftment of gene-edited CD34+ cells 10–12 months post-transplant in rhesus macaques. In summary, gene-corrected CD34+ HSCs are engraftable in xenograft mice and non-human primates. These findings are helpful in designing HSC-targeted gene correction trials.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in SCN5A, encoding the cardiac sodium channel, are linked with familial atrial fibrillation (AF) but the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and implications for therapy remain unclear. To characterize the pathogenesis of AF-linked SCN5A mutations, we generated patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-aCMs) from two kindreds carrying SCN5A mutations (E428K and N470K) and isogenic controls using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. We showed that mutant AF iPSC-aCMs exhibited spontaneous arrhythmogenic activity with beat-to-beat irregularity, prolonged action potential duration, and triggered-like beats. Single-cell recording revealed enhanced late sodium currents (INa,L) in AF iPSC-aCMs that were absent in a heterologous expression model. Gene expression profiling of AF iPSC-aCMs showed differential expression of the nitric oxide (NO)-mediated signaling pathway underlying enhanced INa,L. We showed that patient-specific AF iPSC-aCMs exhibited striking in vitro electrophysiological phenotype of AF-linked SCN5A mutations, and transcriptomic analyses supported that the NO signaling pathway modulated the INa,L and triggered AF.

Abstract: Summary
Silencing of nuclear DNA is an essential feature of innate immune responses to invading pathogens. Early in infection, unintegrated lentiviral cDNA accumulates in the nucleus yet remains poorly expressed. In HIV-1-like lentiviruses, the Vpr accessory protein enhances unintegrated viral DNA expression, suggesting Vpr antagonizes cellular restriction. We previously showed how Vpr remodels the host proteome, identifying multiple cellular targets. We now screen these using a targeted CRISPR-Cas9 library and identify SMC5-SMC6 complex localization factor 2 (SLF2) as the Vpr target responsible for silencing unintegrated HIV-1. SLF2 recruits the SMC5/6 complex to unintegrated lentiviruses, and depletion of SLF2, or the SMC5/6 complex, increases viral expression. ATAC-seq demonstrates that Vpr-mediated SLF2 depletion increases chromatin accessibility of unintegrated virus, suggesting that the SMC5/6 complex compacts viral chromatin to silence gene expression. This work implicates the SMC5/6 complex in nuclear immunosurveillance of extrachromosomal DNA and defines its targeting by Vpr as an evolutionarily conserved antagonism.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-2 is a circulating biomarker of cardiometabolic health. Here, we report that circulating IGFBP-2 concentrations robustly increase after different bariatric procedures in humans, reaching higher levels after biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) than after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). This increase is closely associated with insulin sensitization. In mice and rats, BPD-DS and RYGB operations also increase circulating IGFBP-2 levels, which are not affected by SG or caloric restriction. In mice, Igfbp2 deficiency significantly impairs surgery-induced loss in adiposity and early improvement in insulin sensitivity but does not affect long-term enhancement in glucose homeostasis. This study demonstrates that the modulation of circulating IGFBP-2 may play a role in the early improvement of insulin sensitivity and loss of adiposity brought about by bariatric surgery.

Abstract: Aims
Acute lung injury (ALI) is a leading cause of mortality as a result of inflammatory cytokine overexpression and increased rates of apoptosis. Therapies for ALI are yet to be thoroughly investigated. Recent evidence has shown that irisin exerts protective effects against many types of pathologies. The present study aimed to determine the function of irisin in an ALI mouse model induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the corresponding underlying mechanisms at the tissue, cellular, and molecular levels.
Main methods
We assessed irisin function in A549 cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. The cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. Western blotting and RT-PCR were used to test expression level. Animal models of ALI was established.
Key findings
We found that irisin treatment maintained lung weight, significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine expression, and alleviated lung injury by downregulating miR-199a. In LPS-stimulated cells, forced miR-199a expression downregulated Rad23b expression by targeting its 3′ untranslated region, indicating that Rad23b is a direct target of miR-199a.
Significance
These findings reveal that irisin can alleviate ALI by inhibiting miR-199a and upregulating Rad23b expression, suggesting that irisin has clinical potential for the treatment of ALI.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors with DNA damage repair (DDR) deficiency accumulate genomic alterations that may serve as neoantigens and increase sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitor. However, over half of DDR-deficient tumors are refractory to immunotherapy, and it remains unclear which mutations may promote immunogenicity in which cancer types. We integrate deleterious somatic and germline mutations and methylation data of DDR genes in 10,080 cancers representing 32 cancer types and evaluate the associations of these alterations with tumor neoantigens and immune infiltrates. Our analyses identify DDR pathway mutations that are associated with higher neoantigen loads, adaptive immune markers, and survival outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated animal models and patients. Different immune phenotypes are associated with distinct types of DDR deficiency, depending on the cancer type context. The comprehensive catalog of immune response-associated DDR deficiency may explain variations in immunotherapy outcomes across DDR-deficient cancers and facilitate the development of genomic biomarkers for immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in the isolation and gene expression profiling of single hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have permitted in-depth resolution of their molecular program. However, long-term HSCs can only be isolated to near purity from adult mouse bone marrow, thereby precluding studies of their molecular program in different physiological states. Here, we describe a powerful 7-day HSC hibernation culture system that maintains HSCs as single cells in the absence of a physical niche. Single hibernating HSCs retain full functional potential compared with freshly isolated HSCs with respect to colony-forming capacity and transplantation into primary and secondary recipients. Comparison of hibernating HSC molecular profiles to their freshly isolated counterparts showed a striking degree of molecular similarity, further resolving the core molecular machinery of HSC self-renewal while also identifying key factors that are potentially dispensable for HSC function, including members of the AP1 complex (Jun, Fos, and Ncor2), Sult1a1 and Cish. Finally, we provide evidence that hibernating mouse HSCs can be transduced without compromising their self-renewal activity and demonstrate the applicability of hibernation cultures to human HSCs.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins, in particular Hsp70, play a central role in proteostasis in eukaryotic cells. Due to its chaperone properties, Hsp70 is involved in various processes after stress and under normal physiological conditions. In contrast to mammals and many Diptera species, inducible members of the Hsp70 family in Drosophila are constitutively synthesized at a low level and undergo dramatic induction after temperature elevation or other forms of stress. In the courtship suppression paradigm used in this study, Drosophila males that have been repeatedly rejected by mated females during courtship are less likely than naive males to court other females. Although numerous genes with known function were identified to play important roles in long-term memory, there is, to the best of our knowledge, no direct evidence implicating Hsp70 in this process. To elucidate a possible role of Hsp70 in memory formation, we used D. melanogaster strains containing different hsp70 copy numbers, including strains carrying a deletion of all six hsp70 genes. Our investigations exploring the memory of courtship rejection paradigm demonstrated that a low constitutive level of Hsp70 is apparently required for learning and the formation of short and long-term memories in males. The performed transcriptomic studies demonstrate that males with different hsp70 copy numbers differ significantly in the expression of a few definite groups of genes involved in mating, reproduction, and immunity in response to rejection. Specifically, our analysis reveals several major pathways that depend on the presence of hsp70 in the genome and participate in memory formation and consolidation, including the cAMP signaling cascade.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) has been reported increasingly since the advent of use of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors following the 2009 influenza pandemic. We hypothesize that blocking host NA modulates the immune response against Aspergillus fumigatus. We demonstrate that NA influences the host response against A. fumigatus in vitro and that oseltamivir increases the susceptibility of mice to pulmonary aspergillosis. Oseltamivir impairs the mouse splenocyte and human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) killing capacity of A. fumigatus, and adding NA restores this defect in PBMCs. Furthermore, the sialic acid-binding receptor SIGLEC15 is upregulated in PBMCs stimulated with A. fumigatus. Silencing of SIGLEC15 decrease PBMC killing of A. fumigatus. We provide evidence that host NA activity and sialic acid recognition are important for anti-Aspergillus defense. NA inhibitors might predispose individuals with severe influenza to invasive aspergillosis. These data shed light on the pathogenesis of invasive fungal infections and may identify potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Twist related protein 2 (TWIST2) plays an important role in bone development, tumorigenesis, tumour progression and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). At present, there are few reports about the role of TWIST2 in lung cancer, which need to be further explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the role and molecular mechanism of TWIST2 in the occurrence and development of lung cancer. The expression of TWIST2 in tissues of patients and cell lines was measured using RT-qPCR and western blotting. MTT and CCK8 assays were used to detect cell proliferation and viability. Western blotting was used to measure the expression of EMT-related proteins, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin and Slug. The results revealed that TWIST2 is lowly expressed in the tissues of lung cancer patients and cell lines. Further studies found that overexpression of TWIST2 significantly induced apoptosis and promoted the expression of E-cadherin, as well as inhibiting the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin and Slug. More importantly, TWIST2 induced oxidative stress in lung cancer cells. In addition, TWIST2 regulated the FGF21 and AMPK/mTOR signalling pathway, which is involved in the molecular mechanism of the gene in lung cancer cells. We suggest that the mechanism of TWIST2 inhibition of the progression of lung cancer is by regulating the FGF21-mediated AMPK/mTOR signalling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Limited access to human oligodendrocytes impairs better understanding of oligodendrocyte pathology in myelin diseases. Here, we describe a method to robustly convert human fibroblasts directly into oligodendrocyte-like cells (dc-hiOLs), which allows evaluation of remyelination-promoting compounds and disease modeling. Ectopic expression of SOX10, OLIG2, and NKX6.2 in human fibroblasts results in rapid generation of O4+ cells, which further differentiate into MBP+ mature oligodendrocyte-like cells within 16 days. dc-hiOLs undergo chromatin remodeling to express oligodendrocyte markers, ensheath axons, and nanofibers in vitro, respond to promyelination compound treatment, and recapitulate in vitro oligodendroglial pathologies associated with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher leukodystrophy related to PLP1 mutations. Furthermore, DNA methylome analysis provides evidence that the CpG methylation pattern significantly differs between dc-hiOLs derived from fibroblasts of young and old donors, indicating the maintenance of the source cells’ “age.” In summary, dc-hiOLs represent a reproducible technology that could contribute to personalized medicine in the field of myelin diseases.

Abstract: Purpose
To evaluate Nuclear Factor NF-κB (NF-κB) signaling on microglia activation, migration, and angiogenesis in laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV).
Methods
Nine-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were randomly assigned to IMD-0354 treated or untreated groups (5 mice, 10 eyes per group). CNV was induced with a 532-nm laser. Laser spots (power 250 mW, spot size 100 μm, time of exposure 50 ms) were created in each eye using a slit-lamp delivery system. Selective inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKK2) inhibitor IMD-0354 (10 μg) was delivered subconjunctivally; vehicle-treated mice were the control. The treatment effect on CNV development was assessed at five days post-CNV induction in vivo in C57BL/6 and Cx3cr1gfp/wt mice by fluorescent angiography, fundus imaging, and ex vivo by retinal flatmounts immunostaining and Western blot analysis of RPE/Choroidal/Scleral complexes (RCSC) lysates. In vitro evaluations of IMD-0354 effects were performed in the BV-2 microglial cell line using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.
Results
IMD-0354 caused a significant reduction in the fluorescein leakage and size of the laser spot, as well as a reduction in microglial cell migration and suppression of phospho-IκBα, Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), and Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX-2). In vivo and ex vivo observations demonstrated reduced lesion size in mice, CD68, and Allograft inflammatory factor 1 (IBA-1) positive microglia cells migration to the laser injury site in IMD-0354 treated eyes. The data further corroborate with GFP-positive cells infiltration of the CNV site in Cx3cr1wt/gfp mice. In vitro IMD-0354 (10–25 ng/ml) treatment reduced NF-κB activation, expression of COX-2, caused decreased Actin-F presence and organization, resulting in reduced BV-2 cells migration capacity.
Conclusion
The present data indicate that NF-κB activation in microglia and it's migration capacity is involved in the development of laser CNV in mice. Its suppression by NF-κB inhibition might be a promising therapeutic strategy for wet AMD.

Abstract: Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) can be expanded in vitro and induced to differentiate along the cardiac lineage. To recapitulate the phenotype of an adult cardiomyocyte, differentiating progenitors need to upregulate mitochondrial glucose and fatty acid oxidation. Here we cultured and differentiated CDCs using protocols aimed to maintain stemness or to promote differentiation, including triggering fatty acid oxidation using an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Metabolic changes were characterised in undifferentiated CDCs and during differentiation towards a cardiac phenotype. CDCs from rat atria were expanded on fibronectin or collagen IV via cardiosphere formation. Differentiation was assessed using flow cytometry and qPCR and substrate metabolism was quantified using radiolabelled substrates. Collagen IV promoted proliferation of CDCs whereas fibronectin primed cells for differentiation towards a cardiac phenotype. In both populations, treatment with 5-Azacytidine induced a switch towards oxidative metabolism, as shown by changes in gene expression, decreased glycolytic flux and increased oxidation of glucose and palmitate. Addition of a PPARα agonist during differentiation increased both glucose and fatty acid oxidation and expression of cardiac genes. We conclude that oxidative metabolism and cell differentiation act in partnership with increases in one driving an increase in the other.

Abstract: Summary
Microbiota play critical roles in regulating colitis and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is unclear how the microbiota generate protective immunity against these disease states. Here, we find that loss of the innate and adaptive immune signaling molecule, TAK1, in myeloid cells (Tak1ΔM/ΔM) yields complete resistance to chemical-induced colitis and CRC through microbiome alterations that drive protective immunity. Tak1ΔM/ΔM mice exhibit altered microbiota that are critical for resistance, with antibiotic-mediated disruption ablating protection and Tak1ΔM/ΔM microbiota transfer conferring protection against colitis or CRC. The altered microbiota of Tak1ΔM/ΔM mice promote IL-1β and IL-6 signaling pathways, which are required for induction of protective intestinal Th17 cells and resistance. Specifically, Odoribacter splanchnicus is abundant in Tak1ΔM/ΔM mice and sufficient to induce intestinal Th17 cell development and confer resistance against colitis and CRC in wild-type mice. These findings identify specific microbiota strains and immune mechanisms that protect against colitis and CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, and these generally target either the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the viral spike. While RBD-directed antibodies have been extensively studied, far less is known about NTD-directed antibodies. Here, we report cryo-EM and crystal structures for seven potent NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies in complex with spike or isolated NTD. These structures defined several antibody classes, with at least one observed in multiple convalescent donors. The structures revealed that all seven antibodies target a common surface, bordered by glycans N17, N74, N122, and N149. This site—formed primarily by a mobile β-hairpin and several flexible loops—was highly electropositive, located at the periphery of the spike, and the largest glycan-free surface of NTD facing away from the viral membrane. Thus, in contrast to neutralizing RBD-directed antibodies that recognize multiple non-overlapping epitopes, potent NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies appear to target a single supersite.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are capable of providing an unlimited source of cells from all three germ layers and germ cells. The derivation and usage of iPSCs from various animal models may facilitate stem cell-based therapy, gene-modified animal production, and evolutionary studies assessing interspecies differences. However, there is a lack of species-wide methods for deriving iPSCs, in particular by means of non-viral and non-transgene-integrating (NTI) approaches. Here, we demonstrate the iPSC derivation from somatic fibroblasts of multiple mammalian species from three different taxonomic orders, including the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in Primates, the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) in Carnivora, and the pig (Sus scrofa) in Cetartiodactyla, by combinatorial usage of chemical compounds and NTI episomal vectors. Interestingly, the fibroblasts temporarily acquired a neural stem cell-like state during the reprogramming. Collectively, our method, robustly applicable to various species, holds a great potential for facilitating stem cell-based research using various animals in Mammalia.

Abstract: Summary
Despite heterogeneity across the six layers of the mammalian cortex, all excitatory neurons are generated from a single founder population of neuroepithelial stem cells. However, how these progenitors alter their layer competence over time remains unknown. Here, we used human embryonic stem cell-derived cortical progenitors to examine the role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and Notch signaling in influencing cell fate, assessing their impact on progenitor phenotype, cell-cycle kinetics, and layer specificity. Forced early cell-cycle exit, via Notch inhibition, caused rapid, near-exclusive generation of deep-layer VI neurons. In contrast, prolonged FGF2 promoted proliferation and maintained progenitor identity, delaying laminar progression via MAPK-dependent mechanisms. Inhibiting MAPK extended cell-cycle length and led to generation of layer-V CTIP2+ neurons by repressing alternative laminar fates. Taken together, FGF/MAPK regulates the proliferative/neurogenic balance in deep-layer corticogenesis and provides a resource for generating layer-specific neurons for studying development and disease.

Abstract: Development is an irreversible process of differentiating the undifferentiated cells to functional cells. Brain development involves generation of cells with varied phenotype and functions, which is limited during adulthood, stress, damage/degeneration. Cellular reprogramming makes differentiation reversible process with reprogramming somatic/stem cells to alternative fate with/without stem cells. Exogenously expressed transcription factors or small molecule inhibitors have driven reprogramming of stem/somatic cells to neurons providing alternative approach for pre-clinical/clinical testing and therapeutics. Here in, we report a novel approach of microRNA (miR)- induced trans-differentiation of macrophages (CD11b high) to induced neuronal cells (iNCs) (neuronal markershigh- Nestin, Nurr1, Map2, NSE, Tubb3 and Mash1) without exogenous use of transcription factors. miR 9, 124, 155 and 224 successfully transdifferentiated macrophages to neurons with transient stem cell-like phenotype. We report trans differentiation efficacy 18% and 21% with miR 124 and miR 155. in silico(String 10.0, miR gator, mESAdb, TargetScan 7.0) and experimental analysis indicate that the reprogramming involves alteration of pluripotencygenes like Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Nanog and pluripotency miR, miR 302. iNCs also shifted to G0 phase indicating manipulation of cell cycle by these miRs. Further, CD133+ intermediate cells obtained during current protocol could be differentiated to iNCs using miRs. The syanpsin+ neurons were functionally active and displayed intracellular Ca+2 evoke on activation. miRs could also transdifferentiate bone marrow-derived macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to neuronal cells. The current protocol could be employed for direct in vivo reprogramming of macrophages to neurons without teratoma formation for transplantation and clinical studies.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an evolving technology used to elucidate the cellular architecture of adult organs. Previous scRNA-seq on breast tissue utilized reduction mammoplasty samples, which are often histologically abnormal. We report a rapid tissue collection/processing protocol to perform scRNA-seq of breast biopsies of healthy women and identify 23 breast epithelial cell clusters. Putative cell-of-origin signatures derived from these clusters are applied to analyze transcriptomes of ~3,000 breast cancers. Gene signatures derived from mature luminal cell clusters are enriched in ~68% of breast cancers, whereas a signature from a luminal progenitor cluster is enriched in ~20% of breast cancers. Overexpression of luminal progenitor cluster-derived signatures in HER2+, but not in other subtypes, is associated with unfavorable outcome. We identify TBX3 and PDK4 as genes co-expressed with estrogen receptor (ER) in the normal breasts, and their expression analyses in >550 breast cancers enable prognostically relevant subclassification of ER+ breast cancers.

Abstract: DYRK1A, one of the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKs), plays an important role in various biological processes by regulating downstream targets via kinase-dependent and independent mechanisms. Here, we report a novel role of DYRK1A in maintaining tumor growth and stemness of oral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Deletion of DYRK1A from OSCC cells abrogated their in vivo tumorigenicity and self-renewal capacity, the key features of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs; also referred to as tumor-initiating cells). The DYRK1A deletion also induced the suppression of CSC populations and properties, such as migration ability and chemoresistance. Conversely, ectopic expression of DYRK1A in OSCC cells augmented their CSC phenotype. Among five DYRK members (DYRK1A, 1B, 2, 3, and 4), DYRK1A is the most dominantly expressed kinase, and its expression is upregulated in OSCC compared to normal oral epithelial cells. More importantly, DYRK1A was highly enriched in various CSC-enriched OSCC populations compared to their corresponding non-CSC populations, indicating its pivotal role in cancer progression and stemness. Further, our study revealed that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a key regulator in the DYRK1A-mediated CSC regulation. Functional studies demonstrated that the loss of DYRK1A inhibits CSC phenotype via reduction of FGF2. Overexpression of DYRK1A promotes CSC phenotype via upregulation of FGF2. Our study delineates a novel mechanism of cancer stemness regulation by DYRK1A-FGF2 axis in OSCC. Thus, inhibition of DYRK1A would lead to a potential novel therapeutic option for targeting CSCs in OSCC.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria sustain the energy demand of the cell. The composition and functional state of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system are informative indicators of organelle bioenergetic capacity. Here, we describe a highly sensitive and reproducible method for a single-cell quantification of mitochondrial CI- and CIV-containing respiratory supercomplexes (CI∗CIV-SCs) as an alternative means of assessing mitochondrial respiratory chain integrity. We apply a proximity ligation assay (PLA) and stain CI∗CIV-SCs in fixed human and mouse brains, tumorigenic cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs), and neurons. Spatial visualization of CI∗CIV-SCs enables the detection of mitochondrial lesions in various experimental models, including complex tissues undergoing degenerative processes. We report that comparative assessments of CI∗CIV-SCs facilitate the quantitative profiling of even subtle mitochondrial variations by overcoming the confounding effects that mixed cell populations have on other measurements. Together, our PLA-based analysis of CI∗CIV-SCs is a sensitive and complementary technique for detecting cell-type-specific mitochondrial perturbations in fixed materials.

Abstract: Summary
Synthetic peptides are attractive candidates to manipulate protein-protein interactions inside the cell as they mimic natural interactions to compete for binding. However, protein-peptide interactions are often dynamic and weak. A challenge is to design peptides that make improved interactions with the target. Here, we devise a fragment-linking strategy—“mash-up” design—to deliver a high-affinity ligand, KinTag, for the kinesin-1 motor. Using structural insights from natural micromolar-affinity cargo-adaptor ligands, we have identified and combined key binding features in a single, high-affinity ligand. An X-ray crystal structure demonstrates interactions as designed and reveals only a modest increase in interface area. Moreover, when genetically encoded, KinTag promotes transport of lysosomes with higher efficiency than natural sequences, revealing a direct link between motor-adaptor binding affinity and organelle transport. Together, these data demonstrate a fragment-linking strategy for peptide design and its application in a synthetic motor ligand to direct cellular cargo transport.

Abstract: Summary
Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a new direction in small-molecule therapeutics whereby a heterobifunctional linker to a protein of interest (POI) induces its ubiquitination-based proteolysis by recruiting an E3 ligase. Here, we show that charge reduction, native mass spectrometry, and gas-phase activation methods combine for an in-depth analysis of a PROTAC-linked ternary complex. Electron capture dissociation (ECD) of the intact POI-PROTAC-VCB complex (a trimeric subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase) promotes POI dissociation. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) causes elimination of the nonperipheral PROTAC, producing an intact VCB-POI complex not seen in solution but consistent with PROTAC-induced protein-protein interactions. In addition, we used ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and collisional activation to identify the source of this unexpected dissociation. Together, the evidence shows that this integrated approach can be used to screen for ternary complex formation and PROTAC-protein contacts and may report on PROTAC-induced protein-protein interactions, a characteristic correlated with PROTAC selectivity and efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) frequently develop neurological symptoms, but the biological underpinnings of these phenomena are unknown. Through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and cytokine analyses of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood from individuals with COVID-19 with neurological symptoms, we find compartmentalized, CNS-specific T cell activation and B cell responses. All affected individuals had CSF anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies whose target epitopes diverged from serum antibodies. In an animal model, we find that intrathecal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are present only during brain infection and not elicited by pulmonary infection. We produced CSF-derived monoclonal antibodies from an individual with COVID-19 and found that these monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) target antiviral and antineural antigens, including one mAb that reacted to spike protein and neural tissue. CSF immunoglobulin G (IgG) from 5 of 7 patients showed antineural reactivity. This immune survey reveals evidence of a compartmentalized immune response in the CNS of individuals with COVID-19 and suggests a role of autoimmunity in neurologic sequelae of COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
The Drosophila intestine is an excellent system for elucidating mechanisms regulating stem cell behavior. Here we show that the septate junction (SJ) protein Neuroglian (Nrg) is expressed in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and enteroblasts (EBs) within the fly intestine. SJs are not present between ISCs and EBs, suggesting Nrg plays a different role in this tissue. We reveal that Nrg is required for ISC proliferation in young flies, and depletion of Nrg from ISCs and EBs suppresses increased ISC proliferation in aged flies. Conversely, overexpression of Nrg in ISC and EBs promotes ISC proliferation, leading to an increase in cells expressing ISC/EB markers; in addition, we observe an increase in epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) activation. Genetic epistasis experiments reveal that Nrg acts upstream of Egfr to regulate ISC proliferation. As Nrg function is highly conserved in mammalian systems, our work characterizing the role of Nrg in the intestine has implications for the treatment of intestinal disorders that arise due to altered ISC behavior.

Abstract: Breast cancer has been identified as the most common malignant tumors among women and the morbidity of breast cancer is still increasing rapidly. MEX3A possesses important functions in the regulation of mRNAs and may be involved in a variety of human diseases including cancer, whose relationship with breast cancer is still not clear. In this study, MEX3A was identified as a potential promotor in breast cancer, whose expression was strongly higher in breast cancer tissues than normal tissues. The in vitro experiments showed that MEX3A is capable of promoting the development of breast cancer through stimulating cell proliferation, inhibiting cell apoptosis, arresting cell cycle and promoting cell migration. The functions of MEX3A were also verified in vivo. Furthermore, a combination of genechip analysis and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) identified PIK3CA as a potential downstream target of MEX3A, knockdown of which executes similar inhibitory effects on breast cancer and could alleviate MEX3A-induced progression of breast cancer. In conclusion, our study unveiled, as the first time, MEX3A as a tumor promotor for breast cancer, whose function was carried out probably through the regulation of PIK3CA.

Abstract: Summary
PARP14 has been implicated by genetic knockout studies to promote protumor macrophage polarization and suppress the antitumor inflammatory response due to its role in modulating interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-γ signaling pathways. Here, we describe structure-based design efforts leading to the discovery of a potent and highly selective PARP14 chemical probe. RBN012759 inhibits PARP14 with a biochemical half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.003 μM, exhibits >300-fold selectivity over all PARP family members, and its profile enables further study of PARP14 biology and disease association both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of PARP14 with RBN012759 reverses IL-4-driven protumor gene expression in macrophages and induces an inflammatory mRNA signature similar to that induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in primary human tumor explants. These data support an immune suppressive role of PARP14 in tumors and suggest potential utility of PARP14 inhibitors in the treatment of cancer.

Abstract: Tumor progression and metastasis, especially in invasive cancers (such as triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC]), depend on angiogenesis, in which vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular epithelial growth factor receptor [1] has a decisive role, followed by the metastatic spread of cancer cells. Although some studies have shown that anti-VEGFR2/VEGF monoclonal antibodies demonstrated favorable results in the clinic, this approach is not efficient, and further investigations are needed to improve the quality of cancer treatment. Besides, the increased expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in various cancers, for instance, invasive breast cancer, contributes to angiogenesis, facilitating the migration of tumor cells to other parts of the body. Thus, the main goal of our study was to target either VEGFR2 or EpCAM as pivotal players in the progression of angiogenesis in breast cancer. Regarding cancer therapy, the production of bispecific antibodies is easier and more cost-effective compared to monoclonal antibodies, targeting more than one antigen or receptor; for this reason, we produced a recombinant antibody to target cells expressing EpCAM and VEGFR2 via a bispecific antibody to decrease the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. Following the cloning and expression of our desired anti-VEGFR2/EPCAM sequence in E. coli, the accuracy of the expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis, and its binding activities to VEGFR2 and EPCAM on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines were respectively indicated by flow cytometry. Then, its anti-proliferative potential was indicated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and apoptosis assay to evaluate inhibitory effects of the antibody on tumor cells. Subsequently, the data indicated that migration, invasion, and angiogenesis were inhibited in breast cancer cell lines via the bispecific antibody. Furthermore, cytokine analysis indicated that the bispecific antibody could moderate interleukin 8 (IL-8) and IL-6 as key mediators in angiogenesis progression in breast cancer. Thus, our bispecific antibody could be considered as a promising candidate tool to decrease angiogenesis in TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
Biofilms are rigid and largely impenetrable three-dimensional matrices constituting virulence determinants of various pathogenic bacteria. Here, we demonstrate that molecular tweezers, unique supramolecular artificial receptors, modulate biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus. In particular, the tweezers affect the structural and assembly properties of phenol-soluble modulin α1 (PSMα1), a biofilm-scaffolding functional amyloid peptide secreted by S. aureus. The data reveal that CLR01, a diphosphate tweezer, exhibits significant S. aureus biofilm inhibition and disrupts PSMα1 self-assembly and fibrillation, likely through inclusion of lysine side chains of the peptide. In comparison, different peptide binding occurs in the case of CLR05, a tweezer containing methylenecarboxylate units, which exhibits lower affinity for the lysine residues yet disrupts S. aureus biofilm more strongly than CLR01. Our study points to a possible role for molecular tweezers as potent biofilm inhibitors and antibacterial agents, particularly against untreatable biofilm-forming and PSM-producing bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

Abstract: The brain vasculature has several specific features, one of them being the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which supports and protects the brain by allowing for the passage of oxygen and nutrients, while at the same time preventing passage of pathogens and toxins. The BBB also prevents efficient delivery of drugs to the brain, e.g. for treatment of brain tumors. In the murine brain, perivascular fibroblasts were recently identified as a novel potential constituent of the BBB. Here we present the existence of human cells that could be the equivalent to the murine brain perivascular fibroblasts. Using RNA sequencing, we show a similar transcriptomic profile of cultured human brain cells and murine perivascular fibroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease whose precise etiology is unknown. Several studies found alterations in the microbiome of individuals with MS, but the mechanism by which it may affect MS is poorly understood. Here we analyze the microbiome of 129 individuals with MS and find that they harbor distinct microbial patterns compared with controls. To study the functional consequences of these differences, we measure levels of 1,251 serum metabolites in a subgroup of subjects and unravel a distinct metabolite signature that separates affected individuals from controls nearly perfectly (AUC = 0.97). Individuals with MS are found to be depleted in butyrate-producing bacteria and in bacteria that produce indolelactate, an intermediate in generation of the potent neuroprotective antioxidant indolepropionate, which we found to be lower in their serum. We identify microbial and metabolite candidates that may contribute to MS and should be explored further for their causal role and therapeutic potential.

Abstract: Summary
Tryptophan biosynthesis represents an important potential drug target for new anti-TB drugs. We identified a series of indole-4-carboxamides with potent antitubercular activity. In vitro, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) acquired resistance to these compounds through three discrete mechanisms: (1) a decrease in drug metabolism via loss-of-function mutations in the amidase that hydrolyses these carboxamides, (2) an increased biosynthetic rate of tryptophan precursors via loss of allosteric feedback inhibition of anthranilate synthase (TrpE), and (3) mutation of tryptophan synthase (TrpAB) that decreased incorporation of 4-aminoindole into 4-aminotryptophan. Thus, these indole-4-carboxamides act as prodrugs of a tryptophan antimetabolite, 4-aminoindole.

Abstract: Summary
Current super-resolution microscopy (SRM) methods suffer from an intrinsic complexity that might curtail their routine use in cell biology. We describe here random illumination microscopy (RIM) for live-cell imaging at super-resolutions matching that of 3D structured illumination microscopy, in a robust fashion. Based on speckled illumination and statistical image reconstruction, easy to implement and user-friendly, RIM is unaffected by optical aberrations on the excitation side, linear to brightness, and compatible with multicolor live-cell imaging over extended periods of time. We illustrate the potential of RIM on diverse biological applications, from the mobility of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in U2OS cells and kinetochore dynamics in mitotic S. pombe cells to the 3D motion of myosin minifilaments deep inside Drosophila tissues. RIM's inherent simplicity and extended biological applicability, particularly for imaging at increased depths, could help make SRM accessible to biology laboratories.

Abstract: Summary
Many SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals remain asymptomatic. Little is known about the extent and quality of their antiviral humoral response. Here, we analyze antibody functions in 52 asymptomatic infected individuals, 119 mildly symptomatic, and 21 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We measure anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM levels with the S-Flow assay and map IgG-targeted epitopes with a Luminex assay. We also evaluate neutralization, complement deposition, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 or reporter cell systems. We show that COVID-19 sera mediate complement deposition and kill infected cells by ADCC. Sera from asymptomatic individuals neutralize the virus, activate ADCC, and trigger complement deposition. Antibody levels and functions are lower in asymptomatic individuals than they are in symptomatic cases. Antibody functions are correlated, regardless of disease severity. Longitudinal samplings show that antibody functions follow similar kinetics of induction and contraction. Overall, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits polyfunctional antibodies neutralizing the virus and targeting infected cells.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging technologies in stem cell engineering have produced sophisticated organoid platforms by controlling stem cell fate via biomaterial instructive cues. By micropatterning and differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), we have engineered spatially organized cardiac organoids with contracting cardiomyocytes in the center surrounded by stromal cells distributed along the pattern perimeter. We investigated how geometric confinement directed the structural morphology and contractile functions of the cardiac organoids and tailored the pattern geometry to optimize organoid production. Using modern data-mining techniques, we found that pattern sizes significantly affected contraction functions, particularly in the parameters related to contraction duration and diastolic functions. We applied cardiac organoids generated from 600 μm diameter circles as a developmental toxicity screening assay and quantified the embryotoxic potential of nine pharmaceutical compounds. These cardiac organoids have potential use as an in vitro platform for studying organoid structure-function relationships, developmental processes, and drug-induced cardiac developmental toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Candida albicans is a fungal component of the human gut microbiota and an opportunistic pathogen. C. albicans transcription factors (TFs), Wor1 and Efg1, are master regulators of an epigenetic switch required for fungal mating that also control colonization of the mammalian gut. We show that additional mating regulators, WOR2, WOR3, WOR4, AHR1, CZF1, and SSN6, also influence gut commensalism. Using Calling Card-seq to record Candida TF DNA-binding events in the host, we examine the role and relationships of these regulators during murine gut colonization. By comparing in-host transcriptomes of regulatory mutants with enhanced versus diminished commensal fitness, we also identify a set of candidate commensalism effectors. These include Cht2, a GPI-linked chitinase whose gene is bound by Wor1, Czf1, and Efg1 in vivo, that we show promotes commensalism. Thus, the network required for a C. albicans sexual switch is biochemically active in the host intestine and repurposed to direct commensalism.

Abstract: The advent of cellular reprogramming technology converting somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has revolutionized our understandings of neurodegenerative diseases that are otherwise hard to access and model. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating, inflammatory disease of central nervous system eventually causing neuronal death and accompanied disabilities. Here, we report the generation of several relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS) iPSC lines from MS patients along with their age matched healthy controls from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). These patient specific iPSC lines displayed characteristic embryonic stem cell (ESC) morphology and exhibited pluripotency marker expression. Moreover, these MS iPSC lines were successfully differentiated into neural progenitor cells (NPC) after subjecting to neural induction. Furthermore, we identified the elevated expression of cellular senescence hallmarks in RRMS and PPMS neural progenitors unveiling a novel drug target avenue of MS pathophysiology. Thus, our study altogether offers both RRMS and PPMS iPSC cellular models as a good tool for better understanding of MS pathologies and drug testing.

Abstract: Summary
The contributions of the viral component of the microbiome—the virome—to the development of innate and adaptive immunity are largely unknown. Here, we systematically defined the host response in mice to a panel of eukaryotic enteric viruses representing six different families. Infections with most of these viruses were asymptomatic in the mice, the magnitude and duration of which was dependent on the microbiota. Flow cytometric and transcriptional profiling of mice mono-associated with these viruses unveiled general adaptations by the host, such as lymphocyte differentiation and IL-22 signatures in the intestine, as well as numerous viral-strain-specific responses that persisted. Comparison with a dataset derived from analogous bacterial mono-association in mice identified bacterial species that evoke an immune response comparable with the viruses we examined. These results expand an understanding of the immune space occupied by the enteric virome and underscore the importance of viral exposure events.

Abstract: Muscle stem cells (MuSC) are considered as a reliable source of therapeutic cells to restore diseased muscles. However in most cases, injected MuSC-derived myoblasts are rapidly destroyed by the host immune response, which impairs the beneficial effect. By contrast, human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), have been reported to exhibit potent immune regulatory functions. Thus, we investigated, in vitro, the multipotent differentiation- and immunosuppressive capacities of human myoblasts and compared these features with those of human MSC. Myoblasts shared numerous cell surface markers with MSC, including CD73, CD90, CD105 and CD146. Both cell type were negative for HLA-DR and CD45, CD34 and CD31. CD56, a myogenic marker, was expressed by myoblasts exclusively. Myoblasts displayed multipotent potential capabilities with differentiation in chondrocytes, adipocytes and osteoblasts in vitro. Myoblasts also inhibited allogenic T cell proliferation in vitro in a dose dependent manner, very similarly to MSC. This effect was partly mediated via the activation of indolamine 2,3 dioxygenase enzyme (IDO) after IFNγ exposure. Altogether, these data demonstrate that human myoblasts can differentiate in various mesenchymal linages and exhibit powerful immunosuppressive properties in vitro. Such features may open new therapeutic strategies for MuSC-derived myoblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Immune systems respond to “non-self” molecules termed microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Microbial genes encoding MAMPs have adaptive functions and are thus evolutionarily conserved. In the presence of a host, these genes are maladaptive and drive antagonistic pleiotropy (AP) because they promote microbe elimination by activating immune responses. The role AP plays in balancing the functionality of MAMP-coding genes against their immunogenicity is unknown. To address this, we focused on an epitope of flagellin that triggers antibacterial immunity in plants. Flagellin is conserved because it enables motility. Here, we decode the immunogenic and motility profiles of this flagellin epitope and determine the spectrum of amino acid mutations that drives AP. We discover two synthetic mutational tracks that undermine the detection activities of a plant flagellin receptor. These tracks generate epitopes with either antagonist or weaker agonist activities. Finally, we find signatures of these tracks layered atop each other in natural Pseudomonads.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor hypoxia is associated with therapy resistance and poor patient prognosis. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs, designed to selectively target hypoxic cells while sparing normal tissue, represent a promising treatment strategy. We report the pre-clinical efficacy of 1-methyl-2-nitroimidazole panobinostat (NI-Pano, CH-03), a novel bioreductive version of the clinically used lysine deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat. NI-Pano was stable in normoxic (21% O2) conditions and underwent NADPH-CYP-mediated enzymatic bioreduction to release panobinostat in hypoxia (<0.1% O2). Treatment of cells grown in both 2D and 3D with NI-Pano increased acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9, induced apoptosis, and decreased clonogenic survival. Importantly, NI-Pano exhibited growth delay effects as a single agent in tumor xenografts. Pharmacokinetic analysis confirmed the presence of sub-micromolar concentrations of panobinostat in hypoxic mouse xenografts, but not in circulating plasma or kidneys. Together, our pre-clinical results provide a strong mechanistic rationale for the clinical development of NI-Pano for selective targeting of hypoxic tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute (AGO) proteins bind small RNAs to silence complementary RNA transcripts, and they are central to RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is critical for regulation of gene expression and antiviral defense in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which transmit Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever viruses. In mosquitoes, AGO1 mediates miRNA interactions, while AGO2 mediates siRNA interactions. We applied AGO-crosslinking immunoprecipitation (AGO-CLIP) for both AGO1 and AGO2, and we developed a universal software package for CLIP analysis (CLIPflexR), identifying 230 small RNAs and 5,447 small RNA targets that comprise a comprehensive RNAi network map in mosquitoes. RNAi network maps predicted expression levels of small RNA targets in specific tissues. Additionally, this resource identified unexpected, context-dependent AGO2 target preferences, including endogenous viral elements and 3′UTRs. Finally, contrary to current thinking, mosquito AGO2 repressed imperfect targets. These findings expand our understanding of small RNA networks and have broad implications for the study of antiviral RNAi.

Abstract: The proximal tubules, which are part of the kidney, maintain blood homeostasis by absorbing amino acids, glucose, water, and ions such as sodium (Na), potassium, and bicarbonate. Proximal tubule dysfunction is associated with the pathogenesis of many kidney diseases. Renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) are responsible for the main functions of the proximal tubules. Therefore, in vitro experiments using RPTECs would greatly enhance our understanding of nephron physiology and pathobiology. It is preferable to use immortalized cell lines, such as human kidney-2 (HK-2) cells, because they are derived from humans and maintain growth indefinitely. However, tissue-specific RPTEC phenotypes, including apical-basal polarization, are frequently lost in conventional two-dimensional culture methods in part due to microenvironmental deficiencies. To overcome this limitation, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid culture method for HK-2 cells using an extracellular matrix. HK-2 spheroids in 3D culture formed a tubule-like architecture with cellular polarity and showed markedly restored Na transport function. 3D culture of HK-2 cells also increased expression of kidney development–related genes, including WNT9B. Models of human renal tubules using HK-2 spheroids will greatly improve our understanding of the physiology and pathobiology of the kidney.

Abstract: Summary
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major global public health concern. Although rapid point-of-care testing for detecting viral antigen is important for management of the outbreak, the current antigen tests are less sensitive than nucleic acid testing. In our current study, we produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that exclusively react with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and exhibit no cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling suggests that the mAbs bind to epitopes present on the exterior surface of the nucleocapsid, making them suitable for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. We further select the optimal pair of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) mAbs using ELISA and then use this mAb pair to develop immunochromatographic assay augmented with silver amplification technology. Our mAbs recognize the variants of concern (501Y.V1-V3) that are currently in circulation. Because of their high performance, the mAbs of this study can serve as good candidates for developing antigen detection kits for COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
Effective treatment of tuberculosis is frequently hindered by the emerging antimicrobial resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The present study evaluates monocyclic β-lactam compounds targeting the mycobacterial cell wall remodeling. Novel N-thio-β-lactams were designed, synthesized, and characterized on the L,D-transpeptidase-2, a validated target in M. tuberculosis. The candidates were evaluated in biochemical assays identifying five compounds presenting target-specific kinetic constants equal or superior to meropenem, a carbapenem currently considered for tuberculosis therapy. Mass spectrometry in line with the crystal structures of five target-ligand complexes revealed that the N-thio-β-lactams act via an unconventional mode of adduct formation, transferring the thio-residues from the lactam ring to the active-site cysteine of LdtMt2. The resulting stable adducts lead to a long-term inactivation of the target protein. Finally, the candidates were evaluated in vitro against a drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, confirming the antimycobacterial effect of these novel compounds.

Abstract: Congenital anorectal malformations (ARMs) are among the most prominent deformities of the gastrointestinal tract; however, their precise aetiology remains obscure. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that, in the ARM group, the PPPDE1-positive cells were widely distributed in the hindgut epithelial tissue from GD13 to GD16. Immunofluorescence revealed that most TUNEL-, Bax-, and Cytochrome C (Cyt C)-positive cells overlapped with PPPDE1-positive cells in the urorectal septum (URS). Western blotting and quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that PPPDE1 levels were significantly higher in the ARM group from GD13 to GD14 (p < 0.05). IEC-6 cells were transfected with PPPDE1 overexpression plasmid/NC (negative control) or si-PPPDE1/si-NC. Flow cytometry analysis and CCK-8 assay (used to detect apoptosis and proliferation, respectively), as well as western blotting, showed that the levels of PPPDE1 were positively correlated with the pro-apoptotic molecules Bax and Cyt C. Accordingly, aberrantly high expression of PPPDE1 caused a spatiotemporal imbalance in foetal rats with ARMs during hindgut development. Therefore, the upregulation of PPPDE1 may promote epithelial apoptosis and reduce proliferation in the hindgut via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This could affect the fusion of the URS and cloacal membrane, ultimately inhibiting the hindgut development and resulting in ARMs.

Abstract: Vimentin protein is one of the main cytoskeleton and plays an important role in cell motility and metastasis. Nowadays, vimentin is widely studied as an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker of cancer cells while its involvement in cancer proliferation is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the participation of vimentin in regulating cancer proliferation by silencing VIM gene in four cancer cell lines. Our results demonstrated that vimentin loss significantly induced cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, which has not been reported so far. Mechanistically, knockdown of vimentin expression activated AKT phosphorylation and its downstream β-catenin signaling. Nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of β-catenin was enhanced after silencing vimentin expression. Furthermore, vimentin loss could prevent Rictor from autophagy-dependent degradation via reducing AMPK-mediated autophagy signaling. AICAR, an AMPK activator, down-regulated Rictor and p-AKT levels while vimentin knockdown could rescue the effects. In vivo, it was also found that Ki67 expression and p-AKT/β-catenin signaling pathway were obviously up-regulated in the tumor tissues in which vimentin was silenced compared to control groups. Taken together, these data showed the novel function of vimentin in regulating cancer proliferation via Rictor/AKT/β-catenin signaling pathway, which suggested that it need more careful consideration before inhibiting metastatic cancers through targeting vimentin.

Abstract: Summary
Many diseases, including cancer, stem from aberrant activation or overexpression of oncoproteins that are associated with multiple signaling pathways. Although proteins with catalytic activity can be successfully drugged, the majority of other protein families, such as transcription factors, remain intractable due to their lack of ligandable sites. In this study, we report the development of TRAnscription Factor TArgeting Chimeras (TRAFTACs) as a generalizable strategy for targeted transcription factor degradation. We show that TRAFTACs, which consist of a chimeric oligonucleotide that simultaneously binds to the transcription factor of interest (TOI) and to HaloTag-fused dCas9 protein, can induce degradation of the former via the proteasomal pathway. Application of TRAFTACs to two oncogenic TOIs, NF-κB and brachyury, suggests that TRAFTACs can be successfully employed for the targeted degradation of other DNA-binding proteins. Thus, TRAFTAC technology is potentially a generalizable strategy to induce degradation of other transcription factors both in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
We recently reported that the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection is increased significantly by variants in the gene encoding CD101, a protein thought to modify inflammatory responses. Using blood samples from individuals with and without these variants, we demonstrate that CD101 variants modify the prevalence of circulating inflammatory cell types and show that CD101 variants are associated with increased proinflammatory cytokine production by circulating T cells. One category of CD101 variants is associated with a reduced capacity of regulatory T cells to suppress T cell cytokine production, resulting in a reduction in the baseline level of immune quiescence. These data are supported by transcriptomics data revealing alterations in the intrinsic regulation of antiviral pathways and HIV resistance genes in individuals with CD101 variants. Our data support the hypothesis that CD101 contributes to homeostatic regulation of bystander inflammation, with CD101 variants altering heterosexual HIV-1 acquisition by facilitating increased prevalence and altered function of T cell subsets.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell-based embryo models by cultured pluripotent and extra-embryonic lineage stem cells are novel platforms to model early postimplantation development. We showed that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could form ITS (iPSCs and trophectoderm stem cells) and ITX (iPSCs, trophectoderm stem cells, and XEN cells) embryos, resembling the early gastrula embryo developed in vivo. To facilitate the efficient and unbiased analysis of the stem cell-based embryo model, we set up a machine learning workflow to extract multi-dimensional features and perform quantification of ITS embryos using 3D images collected from a high-content screening system. We found that different PSC lines differ in their ability to form embryo-like structures. Through high-content screening of small molecules and cytokines, we identified that BMP4 best promoted the morphogenesis of the ITS embryo. Our study established an innovative strategy to analyze stem cell-based embryo models and uncovered new roles of BMP4 in stem cell-based embryo models.

Abstract: Summary
O-Methyltransferases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways for secondary metabolites such as bacterial antibiotics, human catecholamine neurotransmitters, and plant phenylpropanoids. While thousands of putative O-methyltransferases are found in sequence databases, few examples are functionally characterized. From a pathway engineering perspective, however, it is crucial to know the substrate and product ranges of the respective enzymes to fully exploit their catalytic power. In this study, we developed an in vitro prototyping workflow that allowed us to screen ∼30 enzymes against five substrates in 3 days with high reproducibility. We combined in vitro transcription/translation of the genes of interest with a microliter-scale enzymatic assay in 96-well plates. The substrate conversion was indirectly measured by quantifying the consumption of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine co-factor by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer rather than time-consuming product analysis by chromatography. This workflow allowed us to rapidly prototype thus far uncharacterized O-methyltransferases for future use as biocatalysts.

Abstract: Fusion of cortical granules with oocyte plasma membrane is one of the most significant secretory events to prevent polyspermy during oocyte activation. Cortical granule exocytosis (CGE) is distinct from most other exocytosis because cortical granules are not renewed after secretion. However, it is thought to be mediated by SNARE complex, which mediates membrane fusion in other exocytoses. SNAREs proteins are divided into Q (glutamine)- and R (arginine)-SNAREs. Q-SNAREs include Syntaxins and SNAP25 family, and R-SNAREs include VAMPs family. In mouse oocytes, Syntaxin4 and SNAP23 have been involved in CGE; nevertheless, it is unknown if VAMP is required. Here, we demonstrated by RT-PCR and immunoblotting that VAMP1 and VAMP3 are expressed in mouse oocyte, and they localized in the cortical region of this cell. Using a functional assay to quantify CGE, we showed that tetanus toxin –which specifically cleavages VAMP1, VAMP2 or VAMP3– inhibited CGE suggesting that at least one VAMP was necessary. Function blocking assays demonstrated that only the microinjection of anti-VAMP1 or anti-VAMP3 antibodies abolished CGE in activated oocytes. These findings demonstrate that R-SNAREs sensitive to tetanus toxin, VAMP1 and VAMP3 –but not VAMP2-, are required for CGE and demonstrate that CGE is mediated by the SNARE complex.

Abstract: Adhesion of cells to each other and to the extracellular matrix (ECM) are both required for cellular functions. Cell-to-cell adhesion is mediated by cadherins and their engagement triggers the activation of Stat3, which offers a potent survival signal. Adhesion to the ECM on the other hand, activates FAK which attracts and activates Src, as well as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the PI3k/Akt and Ras/Erk pathways. However, the effect of cell density upon FAK and Akt activity has not been examined. We now demonstrate that, interestingly, despite being potent Stat3 activators, Src and RTKs are unable to activate Stat3 in sparsely growing (i.e., without cadherin engagement), non-neoplastic cells attached to the ECM. In contrast, cell aggregation (i.e., cadherin engagement in the absence of adhesion to a solid substratum) was found to activate both Stat3 and Akt. Pharmacologic or genetic reduction of FAK activity abolished Akt activity at low densities, indicating that FAK is an important activator of Akt in this setting. Notably, FAK knockout increased cellular sensitivity to the Stat3 inhibitor CPA7, while FAK reintroduction restored resistance to this drug. These findings suggest a complementary role of integrin/FAK/Akt and cadherin/Stat3-mediated pro-survival pathways, which may be of significance during neoplastic transformation and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has shown encouraging results in the treatment of hair loss. However, the mechanism by which PBMT controls cell behavior to coordinate hair cycle is unclear. Here, PBMT is found to drive quiescent hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) activation and alleviate hair follicle atrophy. Mechanistically, PBMT triggers a new hair cycle by upregulating β-CATENIN expression in HFSCs. Loss of β-Catenin (Ctnnb1) in HFSCs blocked PBMT-induced hair regeneration. Additionally, we show PBMT-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway to inhibit proteasome degradation of β-CATENIN in HFSCs. Furthermore, PBMT promotes the expression and secretion of WNTs in skin-derived precursors (SKPs) to further activate the β-CATENIN signal in HFSCs. By contrast, eliminating ROS or inhibiting WNT secretion attenuates the activation of HFSCs triggered by PBMT. Collectively, our work suggests that PBMT promotes hair regeneration through synergetic activation of β-CATENIN in HFSCs by ROS and paracrine WNTs by SKPs.

Abstract: Summary
Desulfonation of isethionate by the bacterial glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) isethionate sulfite-lyase (IslA) generates sulfite, a substrate for respiration that in turn produces the disease-associated metabolite hydrogen sulfide. Here, we present a 2.7 Å resolution X-ray structure of wild-type IslA from Bilophila wadsworthia with isethionate bound. In comparison with other GREs, alternate positioning of the active site β strands allows for distinct residue positions to contribute to substrate binding. These structural differences, combined with sequence variations, create a highly tailored active site for the binding of the negatively charged isethionate substrate. Through the kinetic analysis of 14 IslA variants and computational analyses, we probe the mechanism by which radical chemistry is used for C-S bond cleavage. This work further elucidates the structural basis of chemistry within the GRE superfamily and will inform structure-based inhibitor design of IsIA and thus of microbial hydrogen sulfide production.

Abstract: Summary
Coronaviruses have caused several human epidemics and pandemics including the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic antibodies have already shown striking effectiveness against COVID-19. Nevertheless, concerns remain about antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 as well as threats from other sarbecoviruses. Cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-related viruses provide opportunities to address such concerns. Here, we report on crystal structures of a cross-neutralizing antibody, CV38-142, in complex with the receptor-binding domains from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Recognition of the N343 glycosylation site and water-mediated interactions facilitate cross-reactivity of CV38-142 to SARS-related viruses, allowing the antibody to accommodate antigenic variation in these viruses. CV38-142 synergizes with other cross-neutralizing antibodies, notably COVA1-16, to enhance neutralization of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, including circulating variants of concern B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Overall, this study provides valuable information for vaccine and therapeutic design to address current and future antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 and to protect against zoonotic SARS-related coronaviruses.

Abstract: Summary
CD4 T cell effector function is required for optimal containment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. IFNɣ produced by CD4 T cells is a key cytokine that contributes to protection. However, lung-infiltrating CD4 T cells have a limited ability to produce IFNɣ, and IFNɣ plays a lesser protective role within the lung than at sites of Mtb dissemination. In a murine infection model, we observed that IFNɣ production by Mtb-specific CD4 T cells is rapidly extinguished within the granuloma but not within unaffected lung regions, suggesting localized immunosuppression. We identified a signature of TGFβ signaling within granuloma-infiltrating T cells in both mice and rhesus macaques. Selective blockade of TGFβ signaling in T cells resulted in an accumulation of terminally differentiated effector CD4 T cells, improved IFNɣ production within granulomas, and reduced bacterial burdens. These findings uncover a spatially localized immunosuppressive mechanism associated with Mtb infection and provide potential targets for host-directed therapy.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-based sensors for intracellular metabolites are a promising solution to the emerging issue of metabolic heterogeneity. However, their development, i.e., the conversion of an aptamer into an in vivo-functional intracellular metabolite sensor, still harbors challenges. Here, we accomplished this for the glycolytic flux-signaling metabolite, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Starting from in vitro selection of an aptamer, we constructed device libraries with a hammerhead ribozyme as actuator. Using high-throughput screening in yeast with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), next-generation sequencing, and genetic-environmental perturbations to modulate the intracellular FBP levels, we identified a sensor that generates ratiometric fluorescent readout. An abrogated response in sensor mutants and occurrence of two sensor conformations—revealed by RNA structural probing—indicated in vivo riboswitching activity. Microscopy showed that the sensor can differentiate cells with different glycolytic fluxes within yeast populations, opening research avenues into metabolic heterogeneity. We demonstrate the possibility to generate RNA-based sensors for intracellular metabolites for which no natural metabolite-binding RNA element exits.

Abstract: Cardiomyocytes are particularly prone to lipofuscin accumulation. In the aging heart, lipofuscin accumulation is augmented. This study examined distribution of lipofuscin and senescent cardiomyocytes and evaluated improvement of lipofuscin accumulation and cardiomyocytic senescence of the aging heart after treatment with rapamycin. The results of Schmorl staining, Sudan black staining and autofluorescence detection showed that there was more lipofuscin in the myocardium of the ventricles especially in the left ventricle. The conductive tissue contained less lipofuscin than the myocardium. In the aged hearts, lipofuscin accumulation and senescent cardiomyocytes were increased, and the level of autophagy was reduced. In double staining of Sudan black B and senescence-associated β-galactosidase, 10%–20% lipofuscin-loaded cardiomyocytes became senescent. All senescent cardiomyocytes contained lipofuscin deposits. After enhancing autophagy with feed of rapamycin for six months, lipofuscin accumulation and senescence of cardiomyocytes were improved in old rats. Colocalization of autophagic structure and lipofuscin as well as electron micrographs showed that some lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes were sequestrated by autophagic structures. This study suggests that rapamycin-enhanced autopahgy is effective for reducing lipofuscinogenesis and promoting degradation of lipofuscin. Therefore, enhancing autophagy is a novel therapy for alleviating lipofuscin accumulation and myocardial senescence.

Abstract: Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) is a highly adaptable polyphagous migratory pest in tropical and subtropical regions. Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are molecular chaperones that play important roles in the adaptation to various environment stressors. The present study aimed to clarify the response mechanisms of S. frugiperda to various environmental stressors. We obtained five S. furcifera sHsp genes (SfsHsp21.3, SfsHsp20, SfsHsp20.1, SfsHsp19.3, and SfsHsp29) via cloning. The putative proteins encoded by these genes contained a typical α-crystallin domain. The expression patterns of these genes during different developmental stages, in various tissues of male and female adults, as well as in response to extreme temperatures and UV-A stress were studied via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that the expression levels of all five SfsHsp genes differed among the developmental stages as well as among the different tissues of male and female adults. The expression levels of most SfsHsp genes under extreme temperatures and UV-A-induced stress were significantly upregulated in both male and female adults. In contrast, those of SfsHsp20.1 and SfsHsp19.3 were significantly downregulated under cold stress in male adults. Therefore, the different SfsHsp genes of S. frugiperda play unique regulatory roles during development as well as in response to various environmental stressors.

Abstract: Summary
Combined with CRISPR-Cas9 technology and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs), specific single-nucleotide alterations can be introduced into a targeted genomic locus in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); however, ssODN knockin frequency is low compared with deletion induction. Although several Cas9 transduction methods have been reported, the biochemical behavior of CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease in mammalian cells is yet to be explored. Here, we investigated intrinsic cellular factors that affect Cas9 cleavage activity in vitro. We found that intracellular RNA, but not DNA or protein fractions, inhibits Cas9 from binding to single guide RNA (sgRNA) and reduces the enzymatic activity. To prevent this, precomplexing Cas9 and sgRNA before delivery into cells can lead to higher genome editing activity compared with Cas9 overexpression approaches. By optimizing electroporation parameters of precomplexed ribonucleoprotein and ssODN, we achieved efficiencies of single-nucleotide correction as high as 70% and loxP insertion up to 40%. Finally, we could replace the HLA-C1 allele with the C2 allele to generate histocompatibility leukocyte antigen custom-edited iPSCs.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common gastrointestinal cancer globally. Prevention of tumor cell proliferation and metastasis is vital for prolonging patient survival. Polyphenols provide a wide range of health benefits and prevention from cancer. In the gut, urolithins are the major metabolites of polyphenols. The objective of our study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the anticancer effect of urolithin A (UA) on colorectal cancer cells. UA was found to inhibit the cell proliferation of CRC cell lines in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner in HT29, SW480, and SW620 cells. Exposure to UA resulted in cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner along with alteration in the expression of cell cycle–related protein. Treatment of CRC cell lines with UA resulted in the induction of apoptosis. Treatment of HT29, SW480, and SW620 with UA resulted in increased expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins, p53 and p21. Similarly, UA treatment inhibited the anti-apoptotic protein expression of Bcl-2. Moreover, exposure of UA induced cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Furthermore, UA was found to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in CRC cells. These findings indicate that UA possesses anticancer potential and may be used therapeutically for the treatment of CRC.

Hematopoiesis serves as a paradigm for how homeostasis is maintained within hierarchically organized cell populations. However, important questions remain as to the contribution of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) toward maintaining steady state hematopoiesis. A number of in vivo lineage labeling and propagation studies have given rise to contradictory interpretations, leaving key properties of stem cell function unresolved. Using processed flow cytometry data coupled with a biology-driven modeling approach, we show that in vivo flux experiments that come from different laboratories can all be reconciled into a single unifying model, even though they had previously been interpreted as being contradictory. We infer from comparative analysis that different transgenic models display distinct labeling efficiencies across a heterogeneous HSC pool, which we validate by marker gene expression associated with HSC function. Finally, we show how the unified model of HSC differentiation can be used to simulate clonal expansion in the early stages of leukemogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial state changes were shown to be critical for stem cell function. However, variation in the mitochondrial content in stem cells and the implication, if any, on differentiation is poorly understood. Here, using cellular and molecular studies, we show that the planarian pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have low mitochondrial mass compared with their progenitors. Transplantation experiments provided functional validation that neoblasts with low mitochondrial mass are the true PSCs. Further, the mitochondrial mass correlated with OxPhos and inhibiting the transition to OxPhos dependent metabolism in cultured cells resulted in higher PSCs. In summary, we show that low mitochondrial mass is a hallmark of PSCs in planaria and provide a mechanism to isolate live, functionally active, PSCs from different cell cycle stages (G0/G1 and S, G2/M). Our study demonstrates that the change in mitochondrial metabolism, a feature of PSCs is conserved in planaria and highlights its role in organismal regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The Stemformatics myeloid atlas is an integrated transcriptome atlas of human macrophages and dendritic cells that systematically compares freshly isolated tissue-resident, cultured, and pluripotent stem cell–derived myeloid cells. Three classes of tissue-resident macrophage were identified: Kupffer cells and microglia; monocyte-associated; and tumor-associated macrophages. Culture had a major impact on all primary cell phenotypes. Pluripotent stem cell–derived macrophages were characterized by atypical expression of collagen and a highly efferocytotic phenotype. Myeloid subsets, and phenotypes associated with derivation, were reproducible across experimental series including data projected from single-cell studies, demonstrating that the atlas provides a robust reference for myeloid phenotypes. Implementation in Stemformatics.org allows users to visualize patterns of sample grouping or gene expression for user-selected conditions and supports temporary upload of your own microarray or RNA sequencing samples, including single-cell data, to benchmark against the atlas.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are often considered terminally differentiated and poised for bacterial killing. In chronic diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), an unexplained paradox pits massive neutrophil presence against prolonged bacterial infections. Here, we show that neutrophils recruited to CF airways in vivo and in an in vitro transmigration model display rapid and broad transcriptional firing, leading to an upregulation of anabolic genes and a downregulation of antimicrobial genes. Newly transcribed RNAs are mirrored by the appearance of corresponding proteins, confirming active translation in these cells. Treatment by the RNA polymerase II and III inhibitor α-amanitin restores the expression of key antimicrobial genes and increases the bactericidal capacity of CF airway neutrophils in vitro and in short-term sputum cultures ex vivo. Broadly, our findings show that neutrophil plasticity is regulated at the site of inflammation via RNA and protein synthesis, leading to adaptations that affect their canonical functions (i.e., bacterial clearance).

Abstract: We chose to evaluate Hypoxanthine Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) as a possible biomarker for prostate cancer due to its involvement in nucleotide synthesis and cell cycle progression. We utilized two prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and DU145) along with patient tissue and knockdowns to evaluate overall HPRT expression. The surface localization of HPRT was determined utilizing flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy followed by ADCC to evaluate targeting potential. We found significant upregulation of HPRT within malignant samples with approximately 47% of patients had elevated levels of HPRT compared to normal controls. We also observed a significant association between HPRT and the plasma membrane of DU145 cells (p = 0.0004), but found no presence on PC3 cells (p = 0.14). This was confirmed with scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. ADCC experiments were performed to determine whether HPRT could be used as a target antigen for selective cell-mediated killing. We found that DU145 cells treated with HPRT antibodies had a significantly higher incidence of cell death than both isotype treated samples and PC3 cells treated with the same concentrations of HPRT antibody. Finally, we determined that p53 had a significant impact on HPRT expression both internally and on the surface of cancer cells. These results suggest HPRT as a possible biomarker target for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer.

Abstract: Aims
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most common causative bacterial pathogen involved in promoting infection-induced osteomyelitis, a disease resulting in severe bone degradation. In this study, we aimed to identify the mechanism behind inhibition of osteoclast survival and differentiation by CHI3L1, a lectin previously reported to regulate S. aureus-induced osteomyelitis.
Main methods
The role of CHI3L1 in osteoclast survival, proliferation, and differentiation was studied ex vivo using primary human bone marrow derived stem cells (HBMSCs) and transducing them with lentiviral expression vectors or shRNA knockdown constructs. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining. Cell proliferation was assessed using alkaline phosphatase, Alcian Blue, and TRAP staining. The qRT-PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of osteoclast maturation markers, and western blotting was used to analyze protein expression. An in vivo murine model for osteomyelitis and microcomputed tomography analyses of infected femurs were used to study the effects of CHI3L1 on bone erosion.
Key findings
Overexpression of CHI3L1 significantly reduced HBMSC cell viability, proliferation, and differentiation, and knockdown improved these effects in the presence of S. aureus infection. More specifically, CHI3L1 constitutively activated the p38/MAPK pathway to promote apoptosis. Furthermore, CHI3L1 induced activation of the Smad pathway by promoting phosphorylation of Smad-1/5 proteins. Finally, overexpression of CHI3L1 significantly induced bone erosion upon S. aureus infection in a murine osteomyelitis model, and knockdown of CHI3L1 significantly alleviated this effect.
Significance
CHI3L1 played a vital role in osteoblast differentiation and proliferation by regulating the p38/MAPK and Smad signaling pathways to promote S. aureus-induced osteomyelitis.

Abstract: Summary
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the main complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Despite extensive immune profiling of COVID-19 patients, to what extent COVID-19-associated ARDS differs from other causes of ARDS remains unknown. To address this question, here, we build 3 cohorts of patients categorized in COVID-19−ARDS+, COVID-19+ARDS+, and COVID-19+ARDS−, and compare, by high-dimensional mass cytometry, their immune landscape. A cell signature associating S100A9/calprotectin-producing CD169+ monocytes, plasmablasts, and Th1 cells is found in COVID-19+ARDS+, unlike COVID-19−ARDS+ patients. Moreover, this signature is essentially shared with COVID-19+ARDS− patients, suggesting that severe COVID-19 patients, whether or not they experience ARDS, display similar immune profiles. We show an increase in CD14+HLA-DRlow and CD14lowCD16+ monocytes correlating to the occurrence of adverse events during the ICU stay. We demonstrate that COVID-19-associated ARDS displays a specific immune profile and may benefit from personalized therapy in addition to standard ARDS management.

Abstract: Summary
Y box binding protein 1 (YB-1) is a multifunctional protein associated with tumor progression and the emergence of treatment resistance (TR). Here, we report an azopodophyllotoxin small molecule, SU056, that potently inhibits tumor growth and progression via YB-1 inhibition. This YB-1 inhibitor inhibits cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis in ovarian cancer (OC) cells, and arrests in the G1 phase. Inhibitor treatment leads to enrichment of proteins associated with apoptosis and RNA degradation pathways while downregulating spliceosome pathway. In vivo, SU056 independently restrains OC progression and exerts a synergistic effect with paclitaxel to further reduce disease progression with no observable liver toxicity. Moreover, in vitro mechanistic studies showed delayed disease progression via inhibition of drug efflux and multidrug resistance 1, and significantly lower neurotoxicity as compared with etoposide. These data suggest that YB-1 inhibition may be an effective strategy to reduce OC progression, antagonize TR, and decrease patient mortality.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro induction of human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) provides an ideal platform to recapitulate hPGC development. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms regulating the induction of hPGCLCs remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we profiled the chromatin accessibility and transcriptome dynamics throughout the process of hPGCLC induction. Genetic ablation of SOX15 indicated the crucial roles of SOX15 in the maintenance of hPGCLCs. Mechanistically, SOX15 exerted its roles via suppressing somatic gene expression and sustaining latent pluripotency. Notably, ETV5, a downstream regulator of SOX15, was also uncovered to be essential for hPGCLC maintenance. Finally, a stepwise switch of OCT4/SOX2, OCT4/SOX17, and OCT4/SOX15 binding motifs were found to be enriched in closed-to-open regions of human embryonic stem cells, and early- and late-stage hPGCLCs, respectively. Collectively, our data characterized the chromatin accessibility and transcriptome landscapes throughout hPGCLC induction and defined the SOX15-mediated regulatory networks underlying this process.

Abstract: Summary
Aortic rupture and dissection are life-threatening complications of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms (aTAAs), and risk assessment has been largely based on the monitoring of lumen size enlargement. Temporal changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM), which has a critical impact on aortic remodeling, are not routinely evaluated, and cardiovascular biomarkers do not exist to predict aTAA formation. Here, Raman microspectroscopy and Raman imaging are used to identify spectral biomarkers specific for aTAAs in mice and humans by multivariate data analysis (MVA). Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least-squares (MCR-ALS) combined with Lasso regression reveals elastic fiber-derived (Ce1) and collagen fiber-derived (Cc6) components that are significantly increased in aTAA lesions of murine and human aortic tissues. In particular, Cc6 detects changes in amino acid residues, including phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, cysteine, aspartate, and glutamate. Ce1 and Cc6 may serve as diagnostic Raman biomarkers that detect alterations of amino acids derived from aneurysm lesions.

Abstract: Summary
The transplantation of muscle progenitor cells (MuPCs) differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is a promising approach for treating skeletal muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, proper purification of the MuPCs before transplantation is essential for clinical application. Here, by using MYF5 hiPSC reporter lines, we identified two markers for myogenic cell purification: CDH13, which purified most of the myogenic cells, and FGFR4, which purified a subset of MuPCs. Cells purified with each of the markers showed high efficiency for regeneration after transplantation and contributed to the restoration of dystrophin expression in DMD-immunodeficient model mice. Moreover, we found that MYF5 regulates CDH13 expression by binding to the promoter regions. These findings suggest that FGFR4 and CDH13 are strong candidates for the purification of hiPSC-derived MuPCs for therapeutical application.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-specific mechanisms prompting obesity-related development complications in humans remain unclear. We apply multiomics analyses of subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle to examine the effects of acquired obesity among 49 BMI-discordant monozygotic twin pairs. Overall, adipose tissue appears to be more affected by excess body weight than skeletal muscle. In heavier co-twins, we observe a transcriptional pattern of downregulated mitochondrial pathways in both tissues and upregulated inflammatory pathways in adipose tissue. In adipose tissue, heavier co-twins exhibit lower creatine levels; in skeletal muscle, glycolysis- and redox stress-related protein and metabolite levels remain higher. Furthermore, metabolomics analyses in both tissues reveal that several proinflammatory lipids are higher and six of the same lipid derivatives are lower in acquired obesity. Finally, in adipose tissue, but not in skeletal muscle, mitochondrial downregulation and upregulated inflammation are associated with a fatty liver, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, suggesting that adipose tissue dominates in acquired obesity.

Abstract: Hyperinflammation distinguishes COVID-19 patients who develop a slight disease or none, from those progressing to severe and critical conditions. CIGB-258 is a therapeutic option for the latter group of patients. This drug is an altered peptide ligand (APL) derived from the cellular stress protein 60 (HSP60). In preclinical models, this peptide developed anti-inflammatory effects and increased regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Results from a phase I clinical trial with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients indicated that CIGB-258 was safe and reduced inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine specific biomarkers associated with hyperinflammation, some cytokines linked to the cytokine storm granzyme B and perforin in a cohort of COVID-19 patients treated with this peptide. All critically ill patients were under invasive mechanical ventilation and received the intravenous administration of 1 or 2 mg of CIGB-258 every 12 h. Seriously ill patients were treated with oxygen therapy receiving 1 mg of CIGB-258 every 12 h and all patients recovered from their severe condition. Biomarker levels associated with hyperinflammation, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), granzyme B, and perforin, significantly decreased during treatment. Furthermore, we studied the ability of CIGB-258 to induce Tregs in COVID-19 patients and found that Tregs were induced in all patients studied. Altogether, these results support the therapeutic potential of CIGB-258 for diseases associated with hyperinflammation. Clinical trial registry: RPCEC00000313

Abstract: Summary
Human periimplantation development requires the transformation of the naive pluripotent epiblast into a polarized epithelium. Lumenogenesis plays a critical role in this process, as the epiblast undergoes rosette formation and lumen expansion to form the amniotic cavity. Here, we present a high-throughput in vitro model for epiblast morphogenesis. We established a microfluidic workflow to encapsulate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into monodisperse agarose microgels. Strikingly, hPSCs self-organized into polarized epiblast spheroids that could be maintained in self-renewing and differentiating conditions. Encapsulated primed hPSCs required Rho-associated kinase inhibition, in contrast to naive hPSCs. We applied microgel suspension culture to examine the lumen-forming capacity of hPSCs and reveal an increase in lumenogenesis during the naive-to-primed transition. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of co-encapsulating cell types across different lineages and species. Our work provides a foundation for stem cell-based embryo models to interrogate the critical components of human epiblast self-organization and morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are instrumental in identifying loci harboring common single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) that affect human traits and diseases. GWAS hits emerge in clusters, but the focus is often on the most significant hit in each trait- or disease-associated locus. The remaining hits represent SNVs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and are considered redundant and thus frequently marginally reported or exploited. Here, we interrogate the value of integrating the full set of GWAS hits in a locus repeatedly associated with cardiac conduction traits and arrhythmia, SCN5A-SCN10A. Our analysis reveals 5 common 7-SNV haplotypes (Hap1–5) with 2 combinations associated with life-threatening arrhythmia—Brugada syndrome (the risk Hap1/1 and protective Hap2/3 genotypes). Hap1 and Hap2 share 3 SNVs; thus, this analysis suggests that assuming redundancy among clustered GWAS hits can lead to confounding disease-risk associations and supports the need to deconstruct GWAS data in the context of haplotype composition.

Abstract: Summary
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a life-threatening disease with no known curative or preventive therapies. Data from multiple animal models and human studies have linked dysregulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling to AKI. Small molecules that potentiate endogenous BMP signaling should have a beneficial effect in AKI. We performed a high-throughput phenotypic screen and identified a series of FK506 analogs that act as potent BMP potentiators by sequestering FKBP12 from BMP type I receptors. We further showed that calcineurin inhibition was not required for this activity. We identified a calcineurin-sparing FK506 analog oxtFK through late-stage functionalization and structure-guided design. OxtFK demonstrated an improved safety profile in vivo relative to FK506. OxtFK stimulated BMP signaling in vitro and in vivo and protected the kidneys in an AKI mouse model, making it a promising candidate for future development as a first-in-class therapeutic for diseases with dysregulated BMP signaling.

Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) create an unlimited cell source for basic and translational research. Depending on the maturity of cardiac cultures and the intended applications, obtaining hiPSC-CMs as a single-cell, monolayer or three-dimensional clusters can be challenging. Here, we defined strategies to replate hiPSC-CMs on early days (D15-30) or later more mature (D60-150) differentiation cultures. After generation of hiPSCs and derivation of cardiomyocytes, four dissociation reagents Collagenase A/B, Collagenase II, TrypLE, EDTA and five different extracellular matrix materials Laminin, iMatrix-511, Fibronectin, Matrigel, and Geltrex were comparatively evaluated by imaging, cell viability, and contraction analysis. For early cardiac differentiation cultures mimicking mostly the embryonic stage, the highest adhesion, cell viability, and beating frequencies were achieved by treatment with the TrypLE enzyme. Video-based contraction analysis demonstrated higher beating rates after replating compared to before treatment. For later differentiation days of more mature cardiac cultures, dissociation with EDTA and replating cells on Geltrex or Laminin-derivatives yielded better recovery. Cardiac clusters at various sizes were detected in several groups treated with collagenases. Collectively, our findings revealed the selection criteria of the dissociation approach and coating matrix for replating iPSC-CMs based on the maturity and the requirements of further downstream applications.

Abstract: Summary
With the recent approval of highly effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, functional and lasting immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently under investigation as antibody levels in plasma were shown to decline during convalescence. Since the absence of antibodies does not equate to absence of immune memory, we evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells in convalescent individuals. Here, we report a longitudinal assessment of humoral immune responses on 32 donors up to 8 months post-symptom onset. Our observations indicate that anti-Spike and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin M (IgM) in plasma decay rapidly, whereas the reduction of IgG is less prominent. Neutralizing activity also declines rapidly when compared to Fc-effector functions. Concomitantly, the frequencies of RBD-specific IgM+ B cells wane significantly when compared to RBD-specific IgG+ B cells, which remain stable. Our results add to the current understanding of immune memory following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is critical for secondary infection prevention and vaccine efficacy.

Hepatic stellate cell-derived exosomes modulate macrophage inflammatory response,

Abstract: Background
Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) differentiation/activation is central to liver fibrosis and is innately linked to the immune response to liver injury. Exosomes (EXOs) are important means of communication between cell populations. This study sought to characterize EXO release from HSCs and the effect of HSC-EXOs on macrophage cytokine release/function.
Methods
Liver from a rat fibrosis model was analyzed for EXO expression and localization. Quiescent and culture-activated rat and mouse HSCs and activated human HSCs were analyzed for microRNA expression. Mouse, rat, and human HSCs were culture-activated and EXOs purified from culture medium prior to addition to macrophages, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) mRNA and protein measured. The effect of activated HSC-EXOs on macrophage migration was assayed.
Results
Activation of rat HSCs led to increased EXO production in vivo, an effect mirrored by in vitro rat HSC culture-activation. Culture activation of mouse and rat HSCs led to altered EXO microRNA profiles, with a similar microRNA profile detected in activated human HSCs. Addition of activated HSC-EXOs to macrophages stimulated IL-6 and TNFα mRNA expression and protein secretion in mouse and human macrophages, but not for rat HSC-EXO-macrophages. Addition of human EXOs to macrophages stimulated migration, effects mirrored by the direct addition of rhIL-6 and rhTNFα.
Conclusions
HSC-EXOs associate with macrophages and stimulate cytokine synthesis-release and macrophage migration. Constructing a comprehensive understanding of EXO interactions between liver cell populations in the setting of inflammation/fibrosis increases the potential for developing new diagnostic/therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate-like unconventional T cells that are abundant in humans and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are crucial regulators of immune cells. However, whether MAIT cells are regulated by MSCs is unclear. Here, we explored the effect of MSCs on MAIT cells and revealed the underlying mechanism. We found that MSCs did not influence the proliferation of MAIT cells but strikingly induced an activated phenotype with an increased expression of CD69, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and granzyme B. Moreover, MSCs activated MAIT cells in a TCR-MR1-independent mechanism through MSC-secreted IL-15. We revealed that MSC-derived IL-15 activated MAIT cells by enhancing autophagy activity, which was abolished by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. Based on our findings, MAIT cells are activated by MSCs through IL-15-induced autophagy, which may help elucidate the mechanisms underlying some immune responses and diseases and provide guidance for future research.

Abstract: Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has been disastrous to society and effective drugs are urgently needed. The papain-like protease domain (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2) is indispensable for viral replication and represents a putative target for pharmacological intervention. In this work, we describe the development of a potent and selective SCoV2 PLpro inhibitor, 19. The inhibitor not only effectively blocks substrate cleavage and immunosuppressive function imparted by PLpro, but also markedly mitigates SCoV2 replication in human cells, with a submicromolar IC50. We further present a convenient and sensitive activity probe, 7, and complementary assays to readily evaluate SCoV2 PLpro inhibitors in vitro or in cells. In addition, we disclose the co-crystal structure of SCoV2 PLpro in complex with a prototype inhibitor, which illuminates their detailed binding mode. Overall, these findings provide promising leads and important tools for drug discovery aiming to target SCoV2 PLpro.
