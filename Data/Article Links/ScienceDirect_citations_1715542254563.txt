Abstract: Summary
Interest in manipulating the gut microbiota to treat disease has led to a need for understanding how organisms can establish themselves when introduced into a host with an intact microbial community. Here, we employ the concept of orthogonal niche engineering: a resource typically absent from the diet, seaweed, creates a customized niche for an introduced organism. In the short term, co-introduction of this resource at 1% in the diet along with an organism with exclusive access to this resource, Bacteroides plebeius DSM 17135, enables it to colonize at a median abundance of 1% and frequently up to 10 or more percent, both on pulsed and constant seaweed diets. In a two-month follow-up after the initial treatment period, B. plebeius stops responding to seaweed in mice initially on the constant seaweed diet, suggesting treatment regime will affect controllability. These results offer potential for diet-based intervention to introduce and control target organisms.

Abstract: Summary
T cell differentiation in the thymus proceeds in an ordered sequence of developmental events characterized by variable expression of CD4 and CD8 coreceptors. Here, we report that immature single-positive (ISP) thymocytes are molecularly distinct from all other T cell populations in the thymus in their expression of a gene profile that is dependent on the transcription factor BRD4. Conditional deletion of BRD4 at various stages of thymic differentiation reveals that BRD4 selectively regulates the further differentiation of ISPs by targeting cell cycle and metabolic pathways, but it does not affect the extensive proliferation that results in the generation of ISPs. These studies lead to the conclusion that the ISP subpopulation is not a hybrid transitional state but a molecularly distinct subpopulation that is selectively dependent on BRD4.

Abstract: Summary
mTORC1, the major homeostatic sensor and responder, regulates cell catabolism mainly by targeting autophagy. Here, we show that mTORC1 directly controls autophagosome formation via phosphorylation of WIPI2, a critical protein in isolation membrane growth and elongation. mTORC1 phosphorylates Ser395 of WIPI2, directing WIPI2 to interact specifically with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Physiological or pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 in cells promotes WIPI2 stabilization, autophagosome formation, and autophagic degradation. In mouse liver, fasting significantly increases the WIPI2 protein level, while silencing HUWE1 enhances autophagy, and introducing WIPI2 improves lipid clearance. Thus, regulation of the intracellular WIPI2 protein level by mTORC1 and HUWE1 is a key determinant of autophagy flux and may coordinate the initiation, progression, and completion of autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Cells control their size by coordinating cell cycle progression with volume growth. Size control is typically studied at specific cell cycle transitions that are delayed or accelerated depending on size. This focus is well suited for revealing mechanisms acting at these transitions, but neglects the dynamics in other cell cycle phases, and is therefore inherently limited for studying how the characteristic cell size is determined. We address this limitation through a formalism that intuitively visualizes the characteristic size emerging from integrated cell cycle dynamics of individual cells. Applying this formalism to budding yeast, we describe the contributions of the un-budded (G1) and budded (S-G2-M) phase to size adjustments following environmental or genetic perturbations. We show that although the budded phase can be perturbed with little consequences for G1 dynamics, perturbations in G1 propagate to the budded phase. Our study provides an integrated view on cell size determinants in budding yeast.

Abstract: Summary
Phagocytic clearance of degenerating dendrites or axons is critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing neuroinflammation. Externalized phosphatidylserine (PS) has been postulated to be an “eat-me” signal allowing recognition of degenerating neurites by phagocytes. Here we show that in Drosophila, PS is dynamically exposed on degenerating dendrites during developmental pruning and after physical injury, but PS exposure is suppressed when dendrite degeneration is genetically blocked. Ectopic PS exposure via phospholipid flippase knockout and scramblase overexpression induced PS exposure preferentially at distal dendrites and caused distinct modes of neurite loss that differ in larval sensory dendrites and in adult olfactory axons. Surprisingly, extracellular lactadherin that lacks the integrin-interaction domain induced phagocyte-dependent degeneration of PS-exposing dendrites, revealing an unidentified bridging function that potentiates phagocytes. Our findings establish a direct causal relationship between PS exposure and neurite degeneration in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor anti-CD19 (CAR19)-T cell immunotherapy-induced clinical remissions in CD19+ B cell lymphomas are often short lived. We tested whether CAR19-engineering of the CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells would result in enhanced anti-lymphoma activity. CAR19-iNKT cells co-operatively activated by CD1d- and CAR19-CD19-dependent interactions are more effective than CAR19-T cells against CD1d-expressing lymphomas in vitro and in vivo. The swifter in vivo anti-lymphoma activity of CAR19-iNKT cells and their enhanced ability to eradicate brain lymphomas underpinned an improved tumor-free and overall survival. CD1D transcriptional de-repression by all-trans retinoic acid results in further enhanced cytotoxicity of CAR19-iNKT cells against CD19+ chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Thus, iNKT cells are a highly efficient platform for CAR-based immunotherapy of lymphomas and possibly other CD1d-expressing cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin ubiquitination by the ubiquitin ligase RNF168 is critical to regulate the DNA damage response (DDR). DDR deficiencies lead to cancer-prone syndromes, but whether this reflects DNA repair defects is still elusive. We identified key factors of the RNF168 pathway as essential mediators of efficient DNA replication in unperturbed S phase. We found that loss of RNF168 leads to reduced replication fork progression and to reversed fork accumulation, particularly evident at repetitive sequences stalling replication. Slow fork progression depends on MRE11-dependent degradation of reversed forks, implicating RNF168 in reversed fork protection and restart. Consistent with regular nucleosomal organization of reversed forks, the replication function of RNF168 requires H2A ubiquitination. As this novel function is shared with the key DDR players ATM, γH2A.X, RNF8, and 53BP1, we propose that double-stranded ends at reversed forks engage classical DDR factors, suggesting an alternative function of this pathway in preventing genome instability and human disease.

Abstract: Summary
Cdkn1a, which encodes p21, functions as a major route for p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest. However, the consequence of Cdkn1a gene dosage on tumor suppression has not been systematically investigated. Here, we employed BAC transgenesis to generate a Cdkn1aSUPER mouse, which harbors an additional Cdkn1a allele within its natural genomic context. We show that these mice display enhanced cell-cycle arrest and reduced apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. Furthermore, using a chemically induced skin cancer model and an autochthonous Kras-driven lung adenocarcinoma model, we show that Cdkn1aSUPER mice display a cancer protection phenotype that is indistinguishable from that observed in Tp53SUPER animals. Moreover, we demonstrate that Tp53 and Cdkn1a cooperate in mediating cancer resistance, using a chemically induced fibrosarcoma model. Overall, our Cdkn1aSUPER allele enabled us to assess the contribution of Cdkn1a to Tp53-mediated tumor suppression.

Abstract: The oncogene c-Jun plays a key role in development and cancer. Yet, its role in cell fate decision remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we report that c-Jun confers different fate decisions upon mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in adhesion vs suspension culture. We developed a Tet-on system for temporal induction of c-Jun expression by Doxycycline treatment in mESCs. We show that mESCs carrying the inducible c-Jun TetOn remain pluripotent and grow slowly in suspension when c-Jun expression is induced, whilst when the cells adhere they undergo differentiation and show normal proliferative potential upon c-Jun induction. Our data indicates that c-Jun pushes mESCs in suspension into cell cycle arrest at G1/S, by activating the cell cycle inhibitors Cdkn1a/b and Cdkn2/a/b/c. Despite this cell cycle arrest, they can still re-enter the cell cycle upon transfer to an adhesive surface, and grow into typical mESC colonies, albeit at a lower efficiency. These results demonstrate that mESCs respond to induced c-Jun overexpression differently in suspension or adherent cultures. Our results suggest that cells in suspension may be more resistant to differentiation than when they adhere.

Abstract: Summary
Although essential for epigenetic inheritance, the transfer of parental histone (H3-H4)2 tetramers that contain epigenetic modifications to replicating DNA strands is poorly understood. Here, we show that the Mcm2-Ctf4-Polα axis facilitates the transfer of parental (H3-H4)2 tetramers to lagging-strand DNA at replication forks. Mutating the conserved histone-binding domain of the Mcm2 subunit of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) DNA helicase, which translocates along the leading-strand template, results in a marked enrichment of parental (H3-H4)2 on leading strand, due to the impairment of the transfer of parental (H3-H4)2 to lagging strands. Similar effects are observed in Ctf4 and Polα primase mutants that disrupt the connection of the CMG helicase to Polα that resides on lagging-strand template. Our results support a model whereby parental (H3-H4)2 complexes displaced from nucleosomes by DNA unwinding at replication forks are transferred by the CMG-Ctf4-Polα complex to lagging-strand DNA for nucleosome assembly at the original location.

Abstract: Summary
The fundamental requirements for regeneration are poorly understood. Planarians can robustly regenerate all tissues after injury, involving stem cells, positional information, and a set of cellular and molecular responses collectively called the “missing tissue” or “regenerative” response. follistatin, which encodes an extracellular Activin inhibitor, is required for the missing tissue response after head amputation and for subsequent regeneration. We found that follistatin is required for the missing tissue response regardless of the wound context, but causes regeneration failure only after head amputation. This head regeneration failure involves follistatin-mediated regulation of Wnt signaling at wounds and is not a consequence of a diminished missing tissue response. All tested contexts of regeneration, including head regeneration, could occur with a defective missing tissue response, but at a slower pace. Our findings suggest that major cellular and molecular programs induced specifically by large injuries function to accelerate regeneration but are dispensable for regeneration itself.

Abstract: Summary
We describe a strategy for developing hydrophilic chemical cocktails for tissue delipidation, decoloring, refractive index (RI) matching, and decalcification, based on comprehensive chemical profiling. More than 1,600 chemicals were screened by a high-throughput evaluation system for each chemical process. The chemical profiling revealed important chemical factors: salt-free amine with high octanol/water partition-coefficient (logP) for delipidation, N-alkylimidazole for decoloring, aromatic amide for RI matching, and protonation of phosphate ion for decalcification. The strategic integration of optimal chemical cocktails provided a series of CUBIC (clear, unobstructed brain/body imaging cocktails and computational analysis) protocols, which efficiently clear mouse organs, mouse body including bone, and even large primate and human tissues. The updated CUBIC protocols are scalable and reproducible, and they enable three-dimensional imaging of the mammalian body and large primate and human tissues. This strategy represents a future paradigm for the rational design of hydrophilic clearing cocktails that can be used for large tissues.

Abstract: Summary
c-Kit is a classic proto-oncogene either mutated or upregulated in cancer cells, and this leads to its constitutive kinase activation and, thus, to uncontrolled proliferation. Although the pro-oncogenic role of c-Kit is of no doubt, some observations do not fit well with c-Kit solely as a tumor-promoting moiety. We show here that c-Kit actively triggers cell death in various cancer cell lines unless engaged by its ligand stem cell factor (SCF). This pro-death activity is enhanced when the kinase activation of c-Kit is silenced and is due to c-Kit intracellular cleavage by caspase-like protease at D816. Moreover, in vivo, overexpression of a c-Kit kinase-dead mutant inhibits tumor growth, and this intrinsic c-Kit tumor-suppressive activity is dependent on the D816 cleavage. Thus, c-Kit acts both as a proto-oncogene via its kinase activity and as a tumor suppressor via its dependence receptor activity.

Abstract: Summary
Overall survival remains very poor for patients diagnosed as having head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Identification of additional biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies are important for improving patient outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), generated by implanting fresh tumor tissue directly from patients into immunodeficient mice, recapitulate many of the features of their corresponding clinical cancers, including histopathological and molecular profiles. Using a large collection of PDX models of HNSCC, we demonstrate that rapid engraftment into immunocompromised mice is highly prognostic and show that genomic deregulation of the G1/S checkpoint pathway correlates with engraftment. Furthermore, CCND1 and CDKN2A genomic alterations are predictive of response to the CDK4and CDK6 inhibitor abemaciclib. Overall, our study supports the pursuit of CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for a substantial proportion of HNSCC patients and demonstrates the potential of using PDX models to identify targeted therapies that will benefit patients who have the poorest outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Importins mediate transport from synapse to soma and from cytoplasm to nucleus, suggesting that perturbation of importin-dependent pathways should have significant neuronal consequences. A behavioral screen on five importin α knockout lines revealed that reduced expression of importin α5 (KPNA1) in hippocampal neurons specifically decreases anxiety in mice. Re-expression of importin α5 in ventral hippocampus of knockout animals increased anxiety behaviors to wild-type levels. Hippocampal neurons lacking importin α5 reveal changes in presynaptic plasticity and modified expression of MeCP2-regulated genes, including sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1). Knockout of importin α5, but not importin α3 or α4, reduces MeCP2 nuclear localization in hippocampal neurons. A Sphk1 blocker reverses anxiolysis in the importin α5 knockout mouse, while pharmacological activation of sphingosine signaling has robust anxiolytic effects in wild-type animals. Thus, importin α5 influences sphingosine-sensitive anxiety pathways by regulating MeCP2 nuclear import in hippocampal neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Comparative immune response profiling is important for selecting next-generation vaccines. We comprehensively evaluated the antibody responses from a panel of nine respiratory vaccines against Ebola virus (EBOV) derived from human and avian paramyxoviruses expressing EBOV glycoprotein (GP). Most vaccines were protective in guinea pigs but yielded antibody repertoires that differed in proportion targeting key antigenic regions, avidity, neutralizing antibody specificities, and linear epitope preferences. Competition studies with monoclonal antibodies from human survivors revealed that some epitopes in GP targeted for neutralization were vector dependent, while EBOV-neutralizing titers correlated with the response magnitude toward the receptor-binding domain and GP1/GP2 interface epitopes. While an immunogen determines the breadth of antibody response, distinct vaccine vectors can induce qualitatively different responses, affecting protective efficacy. These data suggest that immune correlates of vaccine protection cannot be generalized for all vaccines against the same pathogen, even if they use the exact same immunogen.

Abstract: Summary
The microenvironment influences cancer drug response and sustains resistance to therapies targeting receptor-tyrosine kinases. However, if and how the tumor microenvironment can be altered during treatment, contributing to resistance onset, is not known. We show that, under prolonged treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), EGFR- or MET-addicted cancer cells displayed a metabolic shift toward increased glycolysis and lactate production. We identified secreted lactate as the key molecule instructing cancer-associated fibroblasts to produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in a nuclear factor κB-dependent manner. Increased HGF, activating MET-dependent signaling in cancer cells, sustained resistance to TKIs. Functional or pharmacological targeting of molecules involved in the lactate axis abrogated in vivo resistance, demonstrating the crucial role of this metabolite in the adaptive process. This adaptive resistance mechanism was observed in lung cancer patients progressed on EGFR TKIs, demonstrating the clinical relevance of our findings and opening novel scenarios in the challenge to drug resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipocyte activation or beige adipocyte emergence in white adipose tissue (WAT) increases energy expenditure, leading to a reduction in body fat mass and improved glucose metabolism. We found that activin E functions as a hepatokine that enhances thermogenesis in response to cold exposure through beige adipocyte emergence in inguinal WAT (ingWAT). Hepatic activin E overexpression activated thermogenesis through Ucp1 upregulation in ingWAT and other adipose tissues including interscapular brown adipose tissue and mesenteric WAT. Hepatic activin E-transgenic mice exhibited improved insulin sensitivity. Inhibin βE gene silencing inhibited cold-induced Ucp1 induction in ingWAT. Furthermore, in vitro experiments suggested that activin E directly stimulated expression of Ucp1 and Fgf21, which was mediated by transforming growth factor-β or activin type I receptors. We uncovered a function of activin E to stimulate energy expenditure through brown and beige adipocyte activation, suggesting a possible preventive or therapeutic target for obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Classic mechanisms for membrane fusion involve transmembrane proteins that assemble into complexes and dynamically alter their conformation to bend membranes, leading to mixing of membrane lipids (hemifusion) and fusion pore formation. Myomaker and Myomerger govern myoblast fusion and muscle formation but are structurally divergent from traditional fusogenic proteins. Here, we show that Myomaker and Myomerger independently mediate distinct steps in the fusion pathway, where Myomaker is involved in membrane hemifusion and Myomerger is necessary for fusion pore formation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Myomerger is required on the cell surface where its ectodomains stress membranes. Moreover, we show that Myomerger drives fusion completion in a heterologous system independent of Myomaker and that a Myomaker-Myomerger physical interaction is not required for function. Collectively, our data identify a stepwise cell fusion mechanism in myoblasts where different proteins are delegated to perform unique membrane functions essential for membrane coalescence.

Abstract: Summary
Most sporadic carcinomas with high metastatic activity show an increased rate of changes in chromosome structure and number, known as chromosomal instability (CIN). However, the role of CIN in driving invasiveness remains unclear. Using an epithelial model in Drosophila, we present evidence that CIN promotes a rapid and general invasive behavior. Cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes delaminate from the epithelium, extend actin-based cellular protrusions, form membrane blebs, and invade neighboring tissues. This behavior is governed by the activation of non-muscle Myosin II by Rho kinase and by the expression of the secreted EGF/Spitz ligand. We unravel fundamental roles of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways mediated by the Fos proto-oncogene and the Capicua tumor suppressor gene in the invasive behavior of CIN-induced aneuploid cells. Our results support the proposal that the simple production of unbalanced karyotypes contributes to CIN-induced metastatic progression.

Abstract: Summary
Primary cilia are required for Smoothened to transduce vertebrate Hedgehog signals, but how Smoothened accumulates in cilia and is activated is incompletely understood. Here, we identify cilia-associated oxysterols that promote Smoothened accumulation in cilia and activate the Hedgehog pathway. Our data reveal that cilia-associated oxysterols bind to two distinct Smoothened domains to modulate Smoothened accumulation in cilia and tune the intensity of Hedgehog pathway activation. We find that the oxysterol synthase HSD11β2 participates in the production of Smoothened-activating oxysterols and promotes Hedgehog pathway activity. Inhibiting oxysterol biosynthesis impedes oncogenic Hedgehog pathway activation and attenuates the growth of Hedgehog pathway-associated medulloblastoma, suggesting that targeted inhibition of Smoothened-activating oxysterol production may be therapeutically useful for patients with Hedgehog-associated cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Cell division axes during development are specified in different orientations to establish multicellular assemblies, but the mechanisms that generate division axis diversity remain unclear. We show here that patterns of cell contact provide cues that diversify cell division orientation by modulating cortical non-muscle myosin flow. We reconstituted in vivo contact patterns using beads or isolated cells to show two findings. First, we identified three contact-dependent cues that pattern cell division orientation and myosin flow: physical contact, contact asymmetry, and a Wnt signal. Second, we experimentally demonstrated that myosin flow generates forces that trigger plasma membrane movements and propose that their anisotropy drives cell division orientation. Our data suggest that contact-dependent control of myosin specifies the division axes of Caenorhabditis elegans AB, ABa, EMS cells, and the mouse AB cell. The contact pattern-dependent generation of myosin flows, in concert with known microtubule/dynein pathways, may greatly expand division axis diversity during development.

Abstract: Summary
Morphogenesis and mechanoelectrical transduction of the hair cell mechanoreceptor depend on the correct assembly of Usher syndrome (USH) proteins into highly organized macromolecular complexes. Defects in these proteins lead to deafness and vestibular areflexia in USH patients. Mutations in a non-USH protein, glutaredoxin domain-containing cysteine-rich 1 (GRXCR1), cause non-syndromic sensorineural deafness. To understand the deglutathionylating enzyme function of GRXCR1 in deafness, we generated two grxcr1 zebrafish mutant alleles. We found that hair bundles are thinner in homozygous grxcr1 mutants, similar to the USH1 mutants ush1c (Harmonin) and ush1ga (Sans). In vitro assays showed that glutathionylation promotes the interaction between Ush1c and Ush1ga and that Grxcr1 regulates mechanoreceptor development by preventing physical interaction between these proteins without affecting the assembly of another USH1 protein complex, the Ush1c-Cadherin23-Myosin7aa tripartite complex. By elucidating the molecular mechanism through which Grxcr1 functions, we also identify a mechanism that dynamically regulates the formation of Usher protein complexes.

Abstract: Summary
The urothelium is an epithelia barrier lined by a luminal layer of binucleated, octoploid, superficial cells. Superficial cells are critical for production and transport of uroplakins, a family of proteins that assemble into a waterproof crystalline plaque that helps protect against infection and toxic substances. Adult urothelium is nearly quiescent, but rapidly regenerates in response to injury. Yet the mechanism by which binucleated, polyploid, superficial cells are produced remains unclear. Here, we show that superficial cells are likely to be derived from a population of binucleated intermediate cells, which are produced from mononucleated intermediate cells via incomplete cytokinesis. We show that binucleated intermediate and superficial cells increase DNA content via endoreplication, passing through S phase without entering mitosis. The urothelium can be permanently damaged by repetitive or chronic injury or disease. Identification of the mechanism by which superficial cells are produced may be important for developing strategies for urothelial repair.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp90 is an essential chaperone that guards proteome integrity and amounts to 2% of cellular protein. We now find that Hsp90 also has the ability to directly interact with and deform membranes via an evolutionarily conserved amphipathic helix. Using a new cell-free system and in vivo measurements, we show this amphipathic helix allows exosome release by promoting the fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane. We dissect the relationship between Hsp90 conformation and membrane-deforming function and show that mutations and drugs that stabilize the open Hsp90 dimer expose the helix and allow MVB fusion, while these effects are blocked by the closed state. Hence, we structurally separated the Hsp90 membrane-deforming function from its well-characterized chaperone activity, and we show that this previously unrecognized function is required for exosome release.

Abstract: Summary
Beige adipocytes are present in white adipose tissue (WAT) and have thermogenic capacity to orchestrate substantial energy metabolism and counteract obesity. However, adipocyte-derived signals that act on progenitor cells to control beige adipogenesis remain poorly defined. Here, we show that adipose-specific depletion of Raptor, a key component of mTORC1, promoted beige adipogenesis through prostaglandins (PGs) synthesized by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Moreover, Raptor-deficient mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity and COX-2 downregulation. Mechanistically, mTORC1 suppressed COX-2 by phosphorylation of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) and subsequent dissociation of CREB to cox-2 promoter in adipocytes. PG treatment stimulated PKA and promoted differentiation of progenitor cells to beige adipocytes in culture. Ultimately, we show that pharmacological inhibition or suppression of COX-2 attenuated mTORC1 inhibition-induced thermogenic gene expression in inguinal WAT in vivo and in vitro. Our study identifies adipocyte-derived PGs as key regulators of white adipocyte browning, which occurs through mTORC1 and CRTC2.

Abstract: Summary
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is an essential metabolite that acts as a cofactor for most methylation events in the cell. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase METTL16 controls SAM homeostasis by regulating the abundance of SAM synthetase MAT2A mRNA in response to changing intracellular SAM levels. Here we present crystal structures of METTL16 in complex with MAT2A RNA hairpins to uncover critical molecular mechanisms underlying the regulated activity of METTL16. The METTL16-RNA complex structures reveal atomic details of RNA substrates that drive productive methylation by METTL16. In addition, we identify a polypeptide loop in METTL16 near the SAM binding site with an autoregulatory role. We show that mutations that enhance or repress METTL16 activity in vitro correlate with changes in MAT2A mRNA levels in cells. Thus, we demonstrate the structural basis for the specific activity of METTL16 and further suggest the molecular mechanisms by which METTL16 efficiency is tuned to regulate SAM homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
There is increasing appreciation that the immune system plays critical roles not only in the traditional domains of infection and inflammation but also in many areas of biology, including tumorigenesis, metabolism, and even neurobiology. However, one of the major barriers for understanding human immunological mechanisms is that immune assays have not been reproducibly characterized for a sufficiently large and diverse healthy human cohort. Here, we present the 10,000 Immunomes Project (10KIP), a framework for growing a diverse human immunology reference, from ImmPort, a publicly available resource of subject-level immunology data. Although some measurement types are sparse in the presently deposited ImmPort database, the extant data allow for a diversity of robust comparisons. Using 10KIP, we describe variations in serum cytokines and leukocytes by age, race, and sex; define a baseline cell-cytokine network; and describe immunologic changes in pregnancy. All data in the resource are available for visualization and download at http://10kimmunomes.org/.

Abstract: Summary
This work identifies the fragile-X-related protein (FXR1) as a reciprocal regulator of HuR target transcripts in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). FXR1 was identified as an HuR-interacting protein by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The HuR-FXR1 interaction is abrogated in RNase-treated extracts, indicating that their association is tethered by mRNAs. FXR1 expression is induced in diseased but not normal arteries. siRNA knockdown of FXR1 increases the abundance and stability of inflammatory mRNAs, while overexpression of FXR1 reduces their abundance and stability. Conditioned media from FXR1 siRNA-treated VSMCs enhance activation of naive VSMCs. RNA EMSA and RIP demonstrate that FXR1 interacts with an ARE and an element in the 3′ UTR of TNFα. FXR1 expression is increased in VSMCs challenged with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-19, and FXR1 is required for IL-19 reduction of HuR. This suggests that FXR1 is an anti-inflammation responsive, HuR counter-regulatory protein that reduces abundance of pro-inflammatory transcripts.

Abstract: Summary
Enhanced glucose uptake and a switch to glycolysis are key traits of M1 macrophages, whereas enhanced fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation are the main metabolic characteristics of M2 macrophages. Recent studies challenge this traditional view, indicating that glycolysis may also be critically important for M2 macrophage differentiation, based on experiments with 2-DG. Here we confirm the inhibitory effect of 2-DG on glycolysis, but also demonstrate that 2-DG impairs oxidative phosphorylation and significantly reduces 13C-labeled Krebs cycle metabolites and intracellular ATP levels. These metabolic derangements were associated with reduced JAK-STAT6 pathway activity and M2 differentiation marker expression. While glucose deprivation and glucose substitution with galactose effectively suppressed glycolytic activity, there was no effective suppression of oxidative phosphorylation, intracellular ATP levels, STAT6 phosphorylation, and M2 differentiation marker expression. These data indicate that glycolytic stimulation is not required for M2 macrophage differentiation as long as oxidative phosphorylation remains active.

Abstract: Summary
Complement is a critical component of humoral immunity implicated in cancer development; however, its biological contributions to tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. Using the K14-HPV16 transgenic mouse model of squamous carcinogenesis, we report that urokinase (uPA)+ macrophages regulate C3-independent release of C5a during premalignant progression, which in turn regulates protumorigenic properties of C5aR1+ mast cells and macrophages, including suppression of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. Therapeutic inhibition of C5aR1 via the peptide antagonist PMX-53 improved efficacy of paclitaxel chemotherapy associated with increased presence and cytotoxic properties of CXCR3+ effector memory CD8+ T cells in carcinomas, dependent on both macrophage transcriptional programming and IFNγ. Together, these data identify C5aR1-dependent signaling as an important immunomodulatory program in neoplastic tissue tractable for combinatorial cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Adipocytes arise from the commitment and differentiation of adipose precursors in white adipose tissue (WAT). In studying adipogenesis, precursor markers, including Pref-1 and PDGFRα, are used to isolate precursors from stromal vascular fractions of WAT, but the relation among the markers is not known. Here, we used the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system in mice for labeling Pref-1+ cells and for inducible inactivation of the Pref-1 target Sox9. We show the requirement of Sox9 for the maintenance of Pref-1+ proliferative, early precursors. Upon Sox9 inactivation, these Pref-1+ cells become PDGFRα+ cells that express early adipogenic markers. Thus, we show that Pref-1+ cells precede PDGFRα+ cells in the adipogenic pathway and that Sox9 inactivation is required for WAT growth and expansion. Furthermore, we show that in maintaining early adipose precursors, Sox9 activates Meis1, which prevents adipogenic differentiation. Our study also demonstrates the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system for inducible gene inactivation in early adipose precursor populations.

Abstract: Summary
Long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) maintain hematopoietic output throughout an animal’s lifespan. However, with age, the balance is disrupted, and LT-HSCs produce a myeloid-biased output, resulting in poor immune responses to infectious challenge and the development of myeloid leukemias. Here, we show that young and aged LT-HSCs respond differently to inflammatory stress, such that aged LT-HSCs produce a cell-intrinsic, myeloid-biased expression program. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identify a myeloid-biased subset within the LT-HSC population (mLT-HSCs) that is prevalent among aged LT-HSCs. We identify CD61 as a marker of mLT-HSCs and show that CD61-high LT-HSCs are uniquely primed to respond to acute inflammatory challenge. We predict that several transcription factors regulate the mLT-HSCs gene program and show that Klf5, Ikzf1, and Stat3 play an important role in age-related inflammatory myeloid bias. We have therefore identified and isolated an LT-HSC subset that regulates myeloid versus lymphoid balance under inflammatory challenge and with age.

Abstract: Summary
Androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) is crucial for prostate cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. We show that, independent of ligand, AR-V7 binds both androgen-responsive elements (AREs) and non-canonical sites distinct from full-length AR (AR-FL) targets. Consequently, AR-V7 not only recapitulates AR-FL’s partial functions but also regulates an additional gene expression program uniquely via binding to gene promoters rather than ARE enhancers. AR-V7 binding and AR-V7-mediated activation at these unique targets do not require FOXA1 but rely on ZFX and BRD4. Knockdown of ZFX or select unique targets of AR-V7/ZFX, or BRD4 inhibition, suppresses growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. We also define an AR-V7 direct target gene signature that correlates with AR-V7 expression in primary tumors, differentiates metastatic prostate cancer from normal, and predicts poor prognosis. Thus, AR-V7 has both ARE/FOXA1 canonical and ZFX-directed non-canonical regulatory functions in the evolution of anti-androgen therapeutic resistance, providing information to guide effective therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
mRNAs carry two layers of information, the genetic code and the information that dictates their post-transcriptional fate. The latter function relies on a complex interplay between cis-elements and trans-regulators, and unbiased identification of these elements is still challenging. To identify cis-elements that control gene expression, we use dimethyl sulfate (DMS) mutational profiling with sequencing and map changes in mRNA secondary structure following viral infection. Our dynamic structural data reveal a major role for ribosomes in unwinding secondary structures, which is further supported by the relationship we uncover between structure and translation efficiency. Moreover, our analysis revealed dozens of regions in viral and cellular mRNAs that exhibit changes in secondary structure. In-depth analysis of these regions reveals cis-elements in 3′ UTRs that regulate mRNA stability and elements within coding sequences that control translation. Overall, our study demonstrates how mapping dynamic changes in mRNA structure allows unbiased identification of functional regulatory elements.

Self-propagating, amyloidogenic mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates may drive progression of Huntington’s disease (HD). Here, we report the development of a FRET-based mHTT aggregate seeding (FRASE) assay that enables the quantification of mHTT seeding activity (HSA) in complex biosamples from HD patients and disease models. Application of the FRASE assay revealed HSA in brain homogenates of presymptomatic HD transgenic and knockin mice and its progressive increase with phenotypic changes, suggesting that HSA quantitatively tracks disease progression. Biochemical investigations of mouse brain homogenates demonstrated that small, rather than large, mHTT structures are responsible for the HSA measured in FRASE assays. Finally, we assessed the neurotoxicity of mHTT seeds in an inducible Drosophila model transgenic for HTTex1. We found a strong correlation between the HSA measured in adult neurons and the increased mortality of transgenic HD flies, indicating that FRASE assays detect disease-relevant, neurotoxic, mHTT structures with severe phenotypic consequences in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic filopodia of developing neurons function as environmental sensors, regulating the spatial organization of dendrites and proper targeting to presynaptic partners. Dendritic filopodia morphology is determined by the balance of F-actin assembled via two major nucleating pathways, the ARP2/3 complex and formins. The inverse-BAR protein MTSS1 is highly expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs) and has been shown to upregulate ARP2/3 activity. PCs in MTSS1 conditional knockout mice showed dendrite hypoplasia due to excessive contact-induced retraction during development. This phenotype was concomitant with elongated dendritic filopodia and was phenocopied by overactivation of the actin nucleator formin DAAM1 localized in the tips of PC dendritic protrusions. Cell biology assays including single-molecule speckle microscopy demonstrated that MTSS1’s C terminus binds to DAAM1 and paused DAAM1-mediated F-actin polymerization. Thus, MTSS1 plays a dual role as a formin inhibitor and ARP2/3 activator in dendritic filopodia, determining final neuronal morphology.

Abstract: Summary
Substantial improvements in enzyme activity demand multiple mutations at spatially proximal positions in the active site. Such mutations, however, often exhibit unpredictable epistatic (non-additive) effects on activity. Here we describe FuncLib, an automated method for designing multipoint mutations at enzyme active sites using phylogenetic analysis and Rosetta design calculations. We applied FuncLib to two unrelated enzymes, a phosphotriesterase and an acetyl-CoA synthetase. All designs were active, and most showed activity profiles that significantly differed from the wild-type and from one another. Several dozen designs with only 3–6 active-site mutations exhibited 10- to 4,000-fold higher efficiencies with a range of alternative substrates, including hydrolysis of the toxic organophosphate nerve agents soman and cyclosarin and synthesis of butyryl-CoA. FuncLib is implemented as a web server (http://FuncLib.weizmann.ac.il); it circumvents iterative, high-throughput experimental screens and opens the way to designing highly efficient and diverse catalytic repertoires.

Abstract: Summary
Auxin is a major phytohormone that controls numerous aspects of plant development and coordinates plant responses to the environment. Morphogenic gradients of auxin govern cell fate decisions and underlie plant phenotypic plasticity. Polar auxin transport plays a central role in auxin maxima generation. The discovery of the exquisite spatiotemporal expression patterns of auxin biosynthesis genes of the WEI8/TAR and YUC families suggested that local auxin production may contribute to the formation of auxin maxima. Herein, we systematically addressed the role of local auxin biosynthesis in plant development and responses to the stress phytohormone ethylene by manipulating spatiotemporal patterns of WEI8. Our study revealed that local auxin biosynthesis and transport act synergistically and are individually dispensable for root meristem maintenance. In contrast, flower fertility and root responses to ethylene require local auxin production that cannot be fully compensated for by transport in the generation of morphogenic auxin maxima.

Abstract: Summary
The achievement of the final form of an individual requires not only the control of cell size and differentiation but also integrative directional cues to instruct cell movements, positions, and orientations. In Drosophila, the adult epidermis of the abdomen is created de novo by histoblasts. As these expand and fuse, they uniformly orient along the anteroposterior axis. We found that the Dachsous/Fat/Four-jointed (Ds/Ft/Fj) pathway is key for their alignment. The refinement of the tissue-wide expression of the atypical cadherins Ds and Ft result in their polarization and directional adhesiveness. Mechanistically, the axially oriented changes in histoblasts respond to the redesign of the epithelial field. We suggest that the role of Ds/Ft/Fj in long-range oriented cell alignment is a general function and that the regulation of the expression of its components will be crucial in other morphogenetic models or during tissue repair.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian neocortex has undergone remarkable changes through evolution. A consequence of such rapid evolutionary events could be a trade-off that has rendered the brain susceptible to certain neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. We analyzed the exomes of 65 patients with the structural brain malformation periventricular nodular heterotopia (PH). De novo coding variants were observed in excess in genes defining a transcriptomic signature of basal radial glia, a cell type linked to brain evolution. In addition, we located two variants in human isoforms of two genes that have no ortholog in mice. Modulating the levels of one of these isoforms for the gene PLEKHG6 demonstrated its role in regulating neuroprogenitor differentiation and neuronal migration via RhoA, with phenotypic recapitulation of PH in human cerebral organoids. This suggests that this PLEKHG6 isoform is an example of a primate-specific genomic element supporting brain development.

Abstract: Summary
Some monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recovered from survivors of filovirus infections can protect against infection. It is currently unknown whether natural infection also induces some antibodies with the capacity for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). A panel of mAbs obtained from human survivors of filovirus infection caused by Ebola, Bundibugyo, or Marburg viruses was evaluated for their ability to facilitate ADE. ADE was observed readily with all mAbs examined at sub-neutralizing concentrations, and this effect was not restricted to mAbs with a particular epitope specificity, neutralizing capacity, or subclass. Blocking of specific Fcγ receptors reduced but did not abolish ADE that was associated with high-affinity binding antibodies, suggesting that lower-affinity interactions still cause ADE. Mutations of Fc fragments of an mAb that altered its interaction with Fc receptors rendered the antibody partially protective in vivo at a low dose, suggesting that ADE counteracts antibody-mediated protection and facilitates dissemination of filovirus infections.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cells (Treg) are necessary to maintain immunological tolerance and are key players in the control of autoimmune disease susceptibility. Expression of the transcription factor FOXP3 is essential for differentiation of Treg cells and indispensable for their suppressive function. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the mechanisms underlying its regulation. Here, we demonstrate that pro-autophagy protein AMBRA1 is also a key modulator of T cells, regulating the complex network that leads to human Treg differentiation and maintenance. Indeed, through its ability to interact with the phosphatase PP2A, AMBRA1 promotes the stability of the transcriptional activator FOXO3, which, in turn, triggers FOXP3 transcription. Furthermore, we found that AMBRA1 plays a significant role in vivo by regulating Treg cell induction in mouse models of both tumor growth and multiple sclerosis, thus highlighting the role of AMBRA1 in the control of immune homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
In Drosophila, ecdysone hormone levels determine the timing of larval development. Its production is regulated by the stereotypical rise in prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) levels. Additionally, ecdysone levels can also be modulated by nutrition (specifically by amino acids) through their action on Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps). Moreover, in glia, amino-acid-sensitive production of Dilps regulates brain development. In this work, we describe the function of an SLC7 amino acid transporter, Sobremesa (Sbm). Larvae with reduced Sbm levels in glia remain in third instar for an additional 24 hr. These larvae show reduced brain growth with increased body size but do not show reduction in insulin signaling or production. Interestingly, Sbm downregulation in glia leads to reduced Ecdysone production and a surprising delay in the rise of PTTH levels. Our work highlights Sbm as a modulator of both brain development and the timing of larval development via an amino-acid-sensitive and Dilp-independent function of glia.

Abstract: Summary
Cells adapt to nutrient and energy deprivation by inducing autophagy, which is regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPKs). We found that cell metabolism significantly influences the ability to induce autophagy, with mitochondrial complex I function being an important factor in the initiation, amplitude, and duration of the response. We show that phenformin or genetic defects in complex I suppressed autophagy induced by mTOR inhibitors, whereas autophagy was enhanced by strategies that increased mitochondrial metabolism. We report that mTOR inhibitors significantly increased select phospholipids and mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs) in a complex I-dependent manner. We attribute the complex I autophagy defect to the inability to increase MAMs, limiting phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PISD) activity and mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (mtPE), which support autophagy. Our data reveal the dynamic and metabolic regulation of autophagy.

Abstract: Acute gastric mucosal injuries are serious clinical problems worldwide and are principally found with different types of stresses in animals. A constant challenge is to find original plant products that can combat stress. In the present study, we examined the effects of big-leaf mulberry extracts on stomach injury, and the activity of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and total antioxidant activity (TAO) in the gastric mucosae of mice during water immersion and restraint stress (WIRS). Our data showed that WIRS-exposed mice produced several injuries and showed an enhanced iNOS, reduced eNOS activity, and decreased TAO activity in the stomach, whereas pretreatment with big-leaf mulberry extracts increased TAO activitiy. The data from our immunohistochemical study indicated that both iNOS and eNOS were expressed in parietal cells and blood vessels, while nNOS was only weakly expressed in parietal cells. In conclusion, our findings suggested that big-leaf mulberry mitigated WIRS-induced stomach injuries, and NOS signaling may play important roles in the mouse stomach during the recovery process.

Abstract: STIM1 and ORAI1 regulate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in most cell types, and mutations in these proteins have deleterious and diverse effects. We established a mouse line expressing the STIM1 R304 W gain-of-function mutation causing Stormorken syndrome to explore effects on organ and cell physiology. While STIM1 R304 W was lethal in the homozygous state, surviving mice presented with reduced growth, skeletal muscle degeneration, and reduced exercise endurance. Variable STIM1 expression levels between tissues directly impacted cellular SOCE capacity. In contrast to patients with Stormorken syndrome, STIM1 was downregulated in fibroblasts from Stim1R304W/R304W mice, which maintained SOCE despite constitutive protein activity. In studies using foetal liver chimeras, STIM1 protein was undetectable in homozygous megakaryocytes and platelets, resulting in impaired platelet activation and absent SOCE. These data indicate that downregulation of STIM1 R304 W effectively opposes the gain-of-function phenotype associated with this mutation, and highlight the importance of STIM1 in skeletal muscle development and integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Coordinated growth of organs requires communication among cells within and between tissues. In plants, leaf growth is largely dictated by the epidermis; here, asymmetric and self-renewing divisions of the stomatal lineage create two essential cell types—pavement cells and guard cells—in proportions reflecting inputs from local, systemic, and environmental cues. The transcription factor SPEECHLESS (SPCH) is the prime regulator of divisions, but whether and how it is influenced by external cues to provide flexible development is enigmatic. Here, we show that the phytohormone cytokinin (CK) can act as an endogenous signal to affect the extent and types of stomatal lineage divisions and forms a regulatory circuit with SPCH. Local domains of low CK signaling are created by SPCH-dependent cell-type-specific activity of two repressive type-A ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORs (ARRs), ARR16 and ARR17, and two secreted peptides, CLE9 and CLE10, which, together with SPCH, can customize epidermal cell-type composition.

Abstract: Summary
The polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of nine neurodegenerative diseases caused by the expansion of a polyQ tract that results in protein aggregation. Unlike other model organisms, Dictyostelium discoideum is a proteostatic outlier, naturally encoding long polyQ tracts yet resistant to polyQ aggregation. Here we identify serine-rich chaperone protein 1 (SRCP1) as a molecular chaperone that is necessary and sufficient to suppress polyQ aggregation. SRCP1 inhibits aggregation of polyQ-expanded proteins, allowing for their degradation via the proteasome, where SRCP1 is also degraded. SRCP1’s C-terminal domain is essential for its activity in cells, and peptides that mimic this domain suppress polyQ aggregation in vitro. Together our results identify a novel type of molecular chaperone and reveal how nature has dealt with the problem of polyQ aggregation.

Abstract: Summary
Safeguarding cell function and identity following a genotoxic stress challenge entails a tight coordination of DNA damage signaling and repair with chromatin maintenance. How this coordination is achieved and with what impact on chromatin integrity remains elusive. Here, we address these questions by investigating the mechanisms governing the distribution in mammalian chromatin of the histone variant H2A.X, a central player in damage signaling. We reveal that H2A.X is deposited de novo at sites of DNA damage in a repair-coupled manner, whereas the H2A.Z variant is evicted, thus reshaping the chromatin landscape at repair sites. Our mechanistic studies further identify the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) as responsible for the deposition of newly synthesized H2A.X. Functionally, we demonstrate that FACT potentiates H2A.X-dependent signaling of DNA damage. We propose that new H2A.X deposition in chromatin reflects DNA damage experience and may help tailor DNA damage signaling to repair progression.

Abstract: Summary
Cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) is considered a gluconeogenic enzyme; however, its metabolic functions and regulatory mechanisms beyond gluconeogenesis are poorly understood. Here, we describe that dynamic acetylation of PCK1 interconverts the enzyme between gluconeogenic and anaplerotic activities. Under high glucose, p300-dependent hyperacetylation of PCK1 did not lead to protein degradation but instead increased the ability of PCK1 to perform the anaplerotic reaction, converting phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate. Lys91 acetylation destabilizes the active site of PCK1 and favors the reverse reaction. At low energy input, we demonstrate that SIRT1 deacetylates PCK1 and fully restores the gluconeogenic ability of PCK1. Additionally, we found that GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of PCK1 decreases acetylation and increases ubiquitination. Biochemical evidence suggests that serine phosphorylation adjacent to Lys91 stimulates SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of PCK1. This work reveals an unexpected capacity of hyperacetylated PCK1 to promote anaplerotic activity, and the intersection of post-translational control of PCK1 involving acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination.

Abstract: Summary
Protecting stalled DNA replication forks from degradation by promiscuous nucleases is essential to prevent genomic instability, a major driving force of tumorigenesis. Several proteins commonly associated with the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR) have been implicated in the stabilization of stalled forks. Human CtIP, in conjunction with the MRE11 nuclease complex, plays an important role in HR by promoting DSB resection. Here, we report an unanticipated function for CtIP in protecting reversed forks from degradation. Unlike BRCA proteins, which defend nascent DNA strands from nucleolytic attack by MRE11, we find that CtIP protects perturbed forks from erroneous over-resection by DNA2. Finally, we uncover functionally synergistic effects between CtIP and BRCA1 in mitigating replication-stress-induced genomic instability. Collectively, our findings reveal a DSB-resection- and MRE11-independent role for CtIP in preserving fork integrity that contributes to the survival of BRCA1-deficient cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cilia are built and maintained by intraflagellar transport (IFT), driving IFT trains back and forth along the ciliary axoneme. How IFT brings about the intricate ciliary structure and how this structure affects IFT are not well understood. We identify, using single-molecule super-resolution imaging of IFT components in living C. elegans, ciliary subdomains, enabling correlation of IFT-train dynamics to ciliary ultra-structure. In the transition zone, IFT dynamics are impaired, resulting in frequent pauses. At the ciliary base and tip, IFT trains show intriguing turnaround dynamics. Surprisingly, deletion of IFT motor kinesin-II not only affects IFT-train dynamics but also alters ciliary structure. Super-resolution imaging in these mutant animals suggests that the arrangement of IFT trains with respect to the axonemal microtubules is different than in wild-type animals. Our results reveal a complex, mutual interplay between ciliary ultrastructure and IFT-train dynamics, highlighting the importance of physical cues in the control of IFT dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging tick-transmitted flavivirus that circulates in North America and Russia. Up to 5% of deer ticks now test positive for POWV in certain regions of the northern United States. Although POWV infections cause life-threatening encephalitis, there is no vaccine or countermeasure available for prevention or treatment. Here, we developed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated modified mRNA vaccine encoding the POWV prM and E genes and demonstrated its immunogenicity and efficacy in mice following immunization with one or two doses. The POWV mRNA vaccine induced high titers of neutralizing antibody and sterilizing immunity against lethal challenge with different POWV strains. The mRNA vaccine also induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against multiple other tick-borne flaviviruses and protected mice against the distantly related Langat virus. These data demonstrate the utility of the LNP-mRNA vaccine platform for the development of vaccines with protective activity against multiple flaviviruses.

Abstract: Summary
Type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are critical for controlling viral infections. However, the precise dynamics of the IFN response have been difficult to define in vivo. Signaling through type I IFN receptors leads to interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)-dependent gene expression and an antiviral state. As an alternative to tracking IFN, we used an ISRE-dependent reporter mouse to define the cell types, localization, and kinetics of IFN responding cells during influenza virus infection. We find that measurable IFN responses are largely limited to hematopoietic cells, which show a high sensitivity to IFN. Inflammatory monocytes display high basal IFN responses, which are enhanced upon infection and correlate with infection of these cells. We find that inflammatory monocyte development is independent of IFN signaling; however, IFN is critical for chemokine production and recruitment following infection. The data reveal a role for inflammatory monocytes in both basal IFN responses and responses to infection.

Abstract: Summary
Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are extremely detrimental DNA lesions that can lead to cancer-driving mutations and translocations. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) represent the two main repair pathways operating in the context of chromatin to ensure genome stability. Despite extensive efforts, our knowledge of DSB-induced chromatin still remains fragmented. Here, we describe the distribution of 20 chromatin features at multiple DSBs spread throughout the human genome using ChIP-seq. We provide the most comprehensive picture of the chromatin landscape set up at DSBs and identify NHEJ- and HR-specific chromatin events. This study revealed the existence of a DSB-induced monoubiquitination-to-acetylation switch on histone H2B lysine 120, likely mediated by the SAGA complex, as well as higher-order signaling at HR-repaired DSBs whereby histone H1 is evicted while ubiquitin and 53BP1 accumulate over the entire γH2AX domains.

Abstract: Summary
Cell biological studies have shown that protofilament number, a fundamental feature of microtubules, can correlate with the expression of different tubulin isotypes. However, it is not known if tubulin isotypes directly control this basic microtubule property. Here, we report high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions (3.5–3.65 Å) of purified human α1B/β3 and α1B/β2B microtubules and find that the β-tubulin isotype can determine protofilament number. Comparisons of atomic models of 13- and 14-protofilament microtubules reveal how tubulin subunit plasticity, manifested in “accordion-like” distributed structural changes, can accommodate distinct lattice organizations. Furthermore, compared to α1B/β3 microtubules, α1B/β2B filaments are more stable to passive disassembly and against depolymerization by MCAK or chTOG, microtubule-associated proteins with distinct mechanisms of action. Mixing tubulin isotypes in different proportions results in microtubules with protofilament numbers and stabilities intermediate to those of isotypically pure filaments. Together, our findings indicate that microtubule protofilament number and stability can be controlled through β-tubulin isotype composition.

Abstract: Summary
Tankyrase (Tnks) transfers poly(ADP-ribose) on substrates. Whereas studies have highlighted the pivotal roles of Tnks in cancer, cherubism, systemic sclerosis, and viral infection, the requirement for Tnks under physiological contexts remains unclear. Here, we report that the loss of Tnks or its muscle-specific knockdown impairs lifespan, stress tolerance, and energy homeostasis in adult Drosophila. We find that Tnks is a positive regulator in the JNK signaling pathway, and modest alterations in the activity of JNK signaling can strengthen or suppress the Tnks mutant phenotypes. We further identify JNK as a direct substrate of Tnks. Although Tnks-dependent poly-ADP-ribosylation is tightly coupled to proteolysis in the proteasome, we demonstrate that Tnks initiates degradation-independent ubiquitination on two lysine residues of JNK to promote its kinase activity and in vivo functions. Our study uncovers a type of posttranslational modification of Tnks substrates and provides insights into Tnks-mediated physiological roles.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogenesis requires intricate interactions between the germline and somatic cells. Within a given cross section of a seminiferous tubule, multiple germ and somatic cell types co-occur. This cellular heterogeneity has made it difficult to profile distinct cell types at different stages of development. To address this challenge, we collected single-cell RNA sequencing data from ∼35,000 cells from the adult mouse testis and identified all known germ and somatic cells, as well as two unexpected somatic cell types. Our analysis revealed a continuous developmental trajectory of germ cells from spermatogonia to spermatids and identified candidate transcriptional regulators at several transition points during differentiation. Focused analyses delineated four subtypes of spermatogonia and nine subtypes of Sertoli cells; the latter linked to histologically defined developmental stages over the seminiferous epithelial cycle. Overall, this high-resolution cellular atlas represents a community resource and foundation of knowledge to study germ cell development and in vivo gametogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Personalized cancer therapy targeting somatic mutations in patient tumors is increasingly being incorporated into practice. Other therapeutic vulnerabilities resulting from changes in gene expression due to tumor specific epigenetic perturbations are progressively being recognized. These genomic and epigenomic changes are ultimately manifest in the tumor proteome and phosphoproteome. We integrated transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic/phosphoproteomic data to elucidate the cellular origins and therapeutic vulnerabilities of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). We discovered that alveolar RMS occurs further along the developmental program than embryonal RMS. We also identified deregulation of the RAS/MEK/ERK/CDK4/6, G2/M, and unfolded protein response pathways through our integrated analysis. Comprehensive preclinical testing revealed that targeting the WEE1 kinase in the G2/M pathway is the most effective approach in vivo for high-risk RMS.

Abstract: Summary
Organisms regulate gene expression through changes in the activity of transcription factors (TFs). In yeast, the response of genes to changes in TF activity is generally assumed to be encoded in the promoter. To directly test this assumption, we chose 42 genes and, for each, replaced the promoter with a synthetic inducible promoter and measured how protein expression changes as a function of TF activity. Most genes exhibited gene-specific TF dose-response curves not due to differences in mRNA stability, translation, or protein stability. Instead, most genes have an intrinsic ability to buffer the effects of promoter activity. This can be encoded in the open reading frame and the 3′ end of genes and can be implemented by both autoregulatory feedback and by titration of limiting trans regulators. We show experimentally and computationally that, when misexpression of a gene is deleterious, this buffering insulates cells from fitness defects due to misregulation.

Abstract: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is metastatic disease without a known primary and therefore very difficult to identify effective therapy. Previously, we demonstrated partial efficacy of Salmonella typhimurium A1-R (S. typhimurium A1-R) alone and carboplatinum alone (CAR) on a CUP patient tumor in the patient-derived xenograft (PDOX) model. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of S. typhimurium A1-R combined with CAR on the CUP PDOX model. The CUP tumors were implanted orthotopically into the left supraclavicular fossa of nude mice to match the site from which they were resected from the patient. CUP PDOX models were divided randomly into the following 4 groups after the tumor volume reached 100 mm3: G1: untreated group; G2: CAR (30 mg/kg, i.p., weekly, 2 weeks); G3: S. typhimurium A1-R (5x107 CFU/body, i.v., weekly, 2 weeks).; G4: S. typhimurium A1-R combined with CAR (S. typhimurium A1-R; 5x107 CFU/body, i.v., weekly, 2 weeks; CAR, 30 mg/kg, i.p., weekly, 2 weeks). Each group comprised 7 mice. All mice were sacrificed on day 15. Tumor volume and body weight were measured twice a week. S. typhimurium A1-R and CAR moderately inhibited tumor growth compared to the untreated group on day 15 (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). S. typhimurium A1-R combined with CAR inhibited the tumor growth significantly more compared to S. typhimurium A1-R monotherapy or CAR monotherapy on day 15 (P = 0.004 and P = 0.001, respectively). The present report demonstrates that S. typhimurium A1-R can increase the efficacy of a standard drug used for CUP in a PDOX model.

Abstract: The Ca2+ mobilizing second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) regulates intracellular trafficking events, including translocation of certain enveloped viruses through the endolysosomal system. Targeting NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signaling may therefore be an effective strategy for discovering novel antivirals as well as therapeutics for other disorders. To aid discovery of novel scaffolds that modulate NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signaling in human cells, we have investigated the potential of using the sea urchin egg homogenate system for a screening campaign. Known pharmacological inhibitors of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release (but not cADPR- or IP3-evoked Ca2+ release) in this invertebrate system strongly correlated with inhibition of MERS-pseudovirus infectivity in a human cell line. A primary screen of 1534 compounds yielded eighteen ‘hits’ exhibiting >80% inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release. A validation pipeline for these candidates yielded seven drugs that inhibited NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release without depleting acidic Ca2+ stores in a human cell line. These candidates displayed a similar penetrance of inhibition in both the sea urchin system and the human cell line, and the extent of inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signals correlated well with observed inhibition of infectivity of a Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pseudovirus. These experiments support the potential of this simple, homogenate system for screening campaigns to discover modulators of NAADP, cADPR and IP3-dependent Ca2+ signaling with potential therapeutic value.

Abstract: Summary
The beneficial effects of brown adipose tissue (BAT) are attributed to its capacity to oxidize metabolites and produce heat, but recent data suggest that secretory properties of BAT may also be involved. Here, we identify the chemokine CXCL14 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-14) as a novel regulatory factor secreted by BAT in response to thermogenic activation. We found that the CXCL14 released by brown adipocytes recruited alternatively activated (M2) macrophages. Cxcl14-null mice exposed to cold showed impaired BAT activity and low recruitment of macrophages, mainly of the M2 phenotype, into BAT. CXCL14 promoted the browning of white fat and ameliorated glucose/insulin homeostasis in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. Impairment of type 2 cytokine signaling, as seen in Stat6-null mice, blunts the action of CXCL14, promoting adipose tissue browning. We propose that active BAT is a source of CXCL14, which concertedly promotes adaptive thermogenesis via M2 macrophage recruitment, BAT activation, and the browning of white fat.

Abstract: Mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are essential organelles in eukaryotic cells, which play key roles in various biological pathways. Mitochondria are responsible for ATP production, maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis and regulation of apoptosis, while ER is involved in protein folding, lipid metabolism as well as Ca2+ homeostasis. These organelles have their own functions, but they also communicate via mitochondrial-associated ER membrane (MAM) to provide another level of regulations in energy production, lipid process, Ca2+ buffering, and apoptosis. Hence, defects in MAM alter cell survival and death. Here, we review components forming the molecular junctions of MAM and how MAM regulates cellular functions. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of impaired ER-mitochondrial communication in various neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic β cell physiology changes substantially throughout life, yet the mechanisms that drive these changes are poorly understood. Here, we performed comprehensive in vivo quantitative proteomic profiling of pancreatic islets from juvenile and 1-year-old mice. The analysis revealed striking differences in abundance of enzymes controlling glucose metabolism. We show that these changes in protein abundance are associated with higher activities of glucose metabolic enzymes involved in coupling factor generation as well as increased activity of the coupling factor-dependent amplifying pathway of insulin secretion. Nutrient tracing and targeted metabolomics demonstrated accelerated accumulation of glucose-derived metabolites and coupling factors in islets from 1-year-old mice, indicating that age-related changes in glucose metabolism contribute to improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with age. Together, our study provides an in-depth characterization of age-related changes in the islet proteome and establishes metabolic rewiring as an important mechanism for age-associated changes in β cell function.

Abstract: Summary
Streptococcus pneumoniae can acquire antibiotic resistance by activation of competence and subsequent DNA uptake. Here, we demonstrate that aztreonam (ATM) and clavulanic acid (CLA) promote competence. We show that both compounds induce cell chain formation by targeting the d,d-carboxypeptidase PBP3. In support of the hypothesis that chain formation promotes competence, we demonstrate that an autolysin mutant (ΔlytB) is hypercompetent. Since competence is initiated by the binding of a small extracellular peptide (CSP) to a membrane-anchored receptor (ComD), we wondered whether chain formation alters CSP diffusion kinetics. Indeed, ATM or CLA presence affects competence synchronization by shifting from global to local quorum sensing, as CSP is primarily retained to chained cells, rather than shared in a common pool. Importantly, autocrine-like signaling prolongs the time window in which the population is able to take up DNA. Together, these insights demonstrate the versatility of quorum sensing and highlight the importance of an accurate antibiotic prescription.

Abstract: Summary
Nrf2 is a key regulator of the antioxidant defense system, and pharmacological Nrf2 activation is a promising strategy for cancer prevention and promotion of tissue repair. Here we show, however, that activation of Nrf2 in fibroblasts induces cellular senescence. Using a combination of transcriptomics, matrix proteomics, chromatin immunoprecipitation and bioinformatics we demonstrate that fibroblasts with activated Nrf2 deposit a senescence-promoting matrix, with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 being a key inducer of the senescence program. In vivo, activation of Nrf2 in fibroblasts promoted re-epithelialization of skin wounds, but also skin tumorigenesis. The pro-tumorigenic activity is of general relevance, since Nrf2 activation in skin fibroblasts induced the expression of genes characteristic for cancer-associated fibroblasts from different mouse and human tumors. Therefore, activated Nrf2 qualifies as a marker of the cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype. These data highlight the bright and the dark sides of Nrf2 and the need for time-controlled activation of this transcription factor.

Abstract: Summary
At the cellular level, α-tubulin acetylation alters the structure of microtubules to render them mechanically resistant to compressive forces. How this biochemical property of microtubule acetylation relates to mechanosensation remains unknown, although prior studies have shown that microtubule acetylation influences touch perception. Here, we identify the major Drosophila α-tubulin acetylase (dTAT) and show that it plays key roles in several forms of mechanosensation. dTAT is highly expressed in the larval peripheral nervous system (PNS), but it is largely dispensable for neuronal morphogenesis. Mutation of the acetylase gene or the K40 acetylation site in α-tubulin impairs mechanical sensitivity in sensory neurons and behavioral responses to gentle touch, harsh touch, gravity, and vibration stimuli, but not noxious thermal stimulus. Finally, we show that dTAT is required for mechanically induced activation of NOMPC, a microtubule-associated transient receptor potential channel, and functions to maintain integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton in response to mechanical stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome system are two major intracellular proteolytic pathways in eukaryotes. Although several biochemical mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between them have been suggested, little is known about the effect of enhanced proteasome activity on autophagic flux. Here, we found that upregulation of proteasome activity, which was achieved through the inhibition of USP14, significantly impaired cellular autophagic flux, especially at the autophagosome-lysosome fusion step. UVRAG appeared to function as a crucial checkpoint for the proper progression of autophagic flux. Although proteasome activation through USP14 inhibition facilitated the clearance of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and reduced the amount of its oligomeric forms, the same conditions increased the formation of inclusion bodies from nonproteasomal substrates such as huntingtin with long polyglutamine repeats. Our results collectively indicate that USP14 may function as a common denominator in the compensatory negative feedback between the two major proteolytic processes in the cell.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple pathways regulate the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) to suppress potentially dangerous ectopic recombination. Both sequence and chromatin context are thought to influence pathway choice between non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homology-driven recombination. To test the effect of repetitive sequences on break processing, we have inserted TG-rich repeats on one side of an inducible DSB at the budding yeast MAT locus on chromosome III. Five clustered Rap1 sites within a break-proximal TG repeat are sufficient to block Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 recruitment, impair resection, and favor elongation by telomerase. The two sides of the break lose end-to-end tethering and show enhanced, uncoordinated movement. Only the TG-free side is resected and shifts to the nuclear periphery. In contrast to persistent DSBs without TG repeats that are repaired by imprecise NHEJ, nearly all survivors of repeat-proximal DSBs repair the break by a homology-driven, non-reciprocal translocation from ChrIII-R to ChrVII-L. This suppression of imprecise NHEJ at TG-repeat-flanked DSBs requires the Uls1 translocase activity.

Abstract: Canine mammary tumor (CMT) has always been an ideal animal model for human breast cancer (HBC) research, however, there is a lack of various established CMT cell lines corresponding to HBC cell lines. This study was designed to establish a new type of CMT cell line. The primary tumor, CMT-7364, was identified as the intraductal papillary carcinoma, and showed negative immunoreactivity to estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. The CMT-7364 cell line from this primary tumor also shows a negative immunoreactivity to ER, PR, and HER-2, and was negative to epithelial cell markers and positive to mesenchymal cell markers by immunocytochemistry (ICC) analysis. This cell line, which has been stably cultured for more than 115 passages, and was characterized by epithelial origin with the expression of the epithelial antigen by ICC analysis and invasion ability by transwell analysis. In vivo, tumor mass and metastases in the lung were found after inoculating the CMT-7364 cells in the nude mice model, and the immune-complete mice model respectively. The tissues from the xenograft tumor were also negative to ER, PR, and HER-2 by IHC analysis. Thus, a novel triple negative canine mammary cancer cell line, CMT-7364, was successfully established, which could be used as a promising model for the research of immunotherapy and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) mechanism of the triple-negative breast cancer both in canine and human.

Abstract: Summary
The role of primary cilia in mechanosensation is essential in endothelial cell (EC) shear responsiveness. Here, we find that venous, capillary, and progenitor ECs respond to shear stress in vitro in a cilia-dependent manner. We then demonstrate that primary cilia assembly in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived ECs varies between different cell lines with marginal influence of differentiation protocol. hiPSC-derived ECs lacking cilia do not align to shear stress, lack stress fiber assembly, have uncoordinated migration during wound closure in vitro, and have aberrant calcium influx upon shear exposure. Transcriptional analysis reveals variation in regulatory genes involved in ciliogenesis among different hiPSC-derived ECs. Moreover, inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) activity in hiPSC-ECs lacking cilia rescues cilia formation and restores mechanical sensing. Taken together, these results show the importance of primary cilia in hiPSC-EC mechano-responsiveness and its modulation through HDAC6 activity varies among hiPSC-ECs.

Abstract: Summary
Although breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) display plasticity transitioning between quiescent mesenchymal-like (M) and proliferative epithelial-like (E) states, how this plasticity is regulated by metabolic or oxidative stress remains poorly understood. Here, we show that M- and E-BCSCs rely on distinct metabolic pathways and display markedly different sensitivities to inhibitors of glycolysis and redox metabolism. Metabolic or oxidative stress generated by 2DG, H2O2, or hypoxia promotes the transition of ROSlo M-BCSCs to a ROShi E-state. This transition is reversed by N-acetylcysteine and mediated by activation of the AMPK-HIF1α axis. Moreover, E-BCSCs exhibit robust NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses, rendering them vulnerable to ROS-induced differentiation and cytotoxicity following suppression of NRF2 or downstream thioredoxin (TXN) and glutathione (GSH) antioxidant pathways. Co-inhibition of glycolysis and TXN and GSH pathways suppresses tumor growth, tumor-initiating potential, and metastasis by eliminating both M- and E-BCSCs. Exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities of distinct BCSC states provides a novel therapeutic approach targeting this critical tumor cell population.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian brain undergoes sexual differentiation by gonadal hormones during the perinatal critical period. However, the machinery at earlier stages has not been well studied. We found that Ptf1a is expressed in certain neuroepithelial cells and immature neurons around the third ventricle that give rise to various neurons in several hypothalamic nuclei. We show that conditional Ptf1a-deficient mice (Ptf1a cKO) exhibit abnormalities in sex-biased behaviors and reproductive organs in both sexes. Gonadal hormone administration to gonadectomized animals revealed that the abnormal behavior is caused by disorganized sexual development of the knockout brain. Accordingly, expression of sex-biased genes was severely altered in the cKO hypothalamus. In particular, Kiss1, important for sexual differentiation of the brain, was drastically reduced in the cKO hypothalamus, which may contribute to the observed phenotypes in the Ptf1a cKO. These findings suggest that forebrain Ptf1a is one of the earliest regulators for sexual differentiation of the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Glucocorticoids play a critical role in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. While glucocorticoid efficacy can be largely attributed to lymphocyte-specific apoptosis, its molecular basis remains elusive. Here, we studied genome-wide lymphocyte-specific open chromatin domains (LSOs), and integrated LSOs with glucocorticoid-induced RNA transcription and chromatin modulation using an in vivo patient-derived xenograft model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This led to the identification of LSOs critical for glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Glucocorticoid receptor cooperated with CTCF at these LSOs to mediate DNA looping, which was inhibited by increased DNA methylation in glucocorticoid-resistant ALL and non-lymphoid cell types. Our study demonstrates that lymphocyte-specific epigenetic modifications pre-determine glucocorticoid resistance in ALL and may account for the lack of glucocorticoid sensitivity in other cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Somitic cells give rise to a variety of cell types in response to Hh, BMP, and FGF signaling. Cell position within the developing zebrafish somite is highly dynamic: how, when, and where these signals specify cell fate is largely unknown. Combining four-dimensional imaging with pathway perturbations, we characterize the spatiotemporal specification and localization of somitic cells. Muscle formation is guided by highly orchestrated waves of cell specification. We find that FGF directly and indirectly controls the differentiation of fast and slow-twitch muscle lineages, respectively. FGF signaling imposes tight temporal control on Shh induction of slow muscles by regulating the time at which fast-twitch progenitors displace slow-twitch progenitors from contacting the Shh-secreting notochord. Further, we find a reciprocal regulation of fast and slow muscle differentiation, morphogenesis, and migration. In conclusion, robust cell fate determination in the developing somite requires precise spatiotemporal coordination between distinct cell lineages and signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Metastasizing breast carcinoma cells have been hypothesized to mobilize tissue-invasive activity by co-opting the proteolytic systems employed by normal mammary epithelial cells undergoing branching morphogenesis. However, the critical effectors underlying morphogenesis remain unidentified, and their relationship to breast cancer invasion programs is yet to be established. Here, we identify the membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinase, Mmp14/MT1-MMP, but not the closely related proteinase Mmp15/MT2-MMP, as the dominant proteolytic effector of both branching morphogenesis and carcinoma cell invasion in vivo. Unexpectedly, however, epithelial cell-specific targeting of Mmp14/MT1-MMP in the normal mammary gland fails to impair branching, whereas deleting the proteinase in carcinoma cells abrogates invasion, preserves matrix architecture, and completely blocks metastasis. By contrast, in the normal mammary gland, extracellular matrix remodeling and morphogenesis are ablated only when Mmp14/MT1-MMP expression is specifically deleted from the periductal stroma. Together, these findings uncover the overlapping but divergent strategies that underlie developmental versus neoplastic matrix remodeling programs.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and substrate utilization critically regulate the function of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons. Here, we demonstrate that inactivation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in POMC neurons mildly impairs mitochondrial respiration and decreases firing of POMC neurons in lean mice. In contrast, under diet-induced obese conditions, POMC-Cre-specific inactivation of AIF prevents obesity-induced silencing of POMC neurons, translating into improved glucose metabolism, improved leptin, and insulin sensitivity, as well as increased energy expenditure in AIFΔPOMC mice. On a cellular level, AIF deficiency improves mitochondrial morphology, facilitates the utilization of fatty acids for mitochondrial respiration, and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in POMC neurons from obese mice, ultimately leading to restored POMC firing upon HFD feeding. Collectively, partial impairment of mitochondrial function shifts substrate utilization of POMC neurons from glucose to fatty acid metabolism and restores their firing properties, resulting in improved systemic glucose and energy metabolism in obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Cells respond to temperature stress via up- and downregulation of hundreds of genes. This process is thought to be regulated by the heat shock factor HSF1, which controls the release of RNAPII from promoter-proximal pausing. Here, we analyze the events taking place in hESCs upstream of RNAPII release. We find that temperature stress results in the activation or decommissioning of thousands of enhancers. This process involves alterations in the occupancy of transcription factors HSF1, AP-1, NANOG, KLF4, and OCT4 accompanied by nucleosome remodeling by BRG1 and changes in H3K27ac. Furthermore, redistribution of RAD21 and CTCF results in the formation and disassembly of interactions mediated by these two proteins. These alterations tether and untether enhancers to their cognate promoters or refashion insulated neighborhoods, thus transforming the landscape of enhancer-promoter interactions. Details of the 3D interactome remodeling process support loop extrusion initiating at random sites as a mechanism for the establishment of CTCF/cohesin loops.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular RNA levels are determined by transcription and decay rates, which are fundamental in understanding gene expression regulation. Measurement of these two parameters is usually performed independently, complicating analysis as well as introducing methodological biases and batch effects that hamper direct comparison. Here, we present a simple approach of concurrent sequencing of S. cerevisiae poly(A)+ and poly(A)− RNA 3′ ends to simultaneously estimate total RNA levels, transcription, and decay rates from the same RNA sample. The transcription data generated correlate well with reported estimates and also reveal local RNA polymerase stalling and termination sites with high precision. Although the method by design uses brief metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNA with 4-thiouracil, the results demonstrate that transcription estimates can also be gained from unlabeled RNA samples. These findings underscore the potential of the approach, which should be generally applicable to study a range of biological questions in diverse organisms.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factor XBP1s, activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in a dose-dependent manner, plays a central role in adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) via direct activation of multiple genes controlling protein refolding. Here, we report that elevation of ER stress above a critical threshold causes accumulation of XBP1s protein sufficient for binding to the promoter and activation of a gene encoding a transcription factor KLF9. In comparison to other XBP1s targets, KLF9 promoter contains an evolutionary conserved lower-affinity binding site that requires higher amounts of XBP1s for activation. In turn, KLF9 induces expression of two regulators of ER calcium storage, TMEM38B and ITPR1, facilitating additional calcium release from ER, exacerbation of ER stress, and cell death. Accordingly, Klf9 deficiency attenuates tunicamycin-induced ER stress in mouse liver. These data reveal a role for XBP1s in cytotoxic UPR and provide insights into mechanisms of life-or-death decisions in cells under ER stress.

Abstract: Summary
A balanced diet of macronutrients is critical for animal health. A lack of specific elements can have profound effects on behavior, reproduction, and lifespan. Here, we used Drosophila to understand how the brain responds to carbohydrate deprivation. We found that serine protease homologs (SPHs) are enriched among genes that are transcriptionally regulated in flies deprived of carbohydrates. Stimulation of neurons expressing one of these SPHs, Scarface (Scaf), or overexpression of scaf positively regulates feeding on nutritious sugars, whereas inhibition of these neurons or knockdown of scaf reduces feeding. This modulation of food intake occurs only in sated flies while hunger-induced feeding is unaffected. Furthermore, scaf expression correlates with the presence of sugar in the food. As Scaf and Scaf neurons promote feeding independent of the hunger state, and the levels of scaf are positively regulated by the presence of sugar, we conclude that scaf mediates the hedonic control of feeding.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian DREAM complex is responsible for the transcriptional repression of hundreds of cell-cycle-related genes in quiescence. How the DREAM complex recruits chromatin-modifying entities to aid in its repression remains unknown. Using unbiased proteomics analysis, we have uncovered a robust association between the chromatin-associated Sin3B protein and the DREAM complex. We have determined that genetic inactivation of Sin3B results in the de-repression of DREAM target genes during quiescence but is insufficient to allow quiescent cells to resume proliferation. However, inactivation of APC/CCDH1 was sufficient for Sin3B−/− cells, but not parental cells, to re-enter the cell cycle. These studies identify Sin3B as a transcriptional corepressor associated with the DREAM complex in quiescence and reveals a functional cooperation between E2F target repression and APC/CCDH1 in the negative regulation of cell-cycle progression.

Abstract: Current understanding of how cardiac pacemaker cells operate is based mainly on studies in isolated single sinoatrial node cells (SANC), specifically those that rhythmically fire action potentials similar to the in vivo behavior of the intact sinoatrial node. However, only a small fraction of SANC exhibit rhythmic firing after isolation. Other SANC behaviors have not been studied. Here, for the first time, we studied all single cells isolated from the sinoatrial node of the guinea pig, including traditionally studied rhythmically firing cells (‘rhythmic SANC’), dysrhythmically firing cells (‘dysrhythmic SANC’) and cells without any apparent spontaneous firing activity (‘dormant SANC’). Action potential-induced cytosolic Ca2+ transients and spontaneous local Ca2+ releases (LCRs) were measured with a 2D camera. LCRs were present not only in rhythmically firing SANC, but also in dormant and dysrhythmic SANC. While rhythmic SANC were characterized by large LCRs synchronized in space and time towards late diastole, dysrhythmic and dormant SANC exhibited smaller LCRs that appeared stochastically and were widely distributed in time. β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) stimulation increased LCR size and synchronized LCR occurrences in all dysrhythmic and a third of dormant cells (25 of 75 cells tested). In response to βAR stimulation, these dormant SANC developed automaticity, and LCRs became coupled to spontaneous action potential-induced cytosolic Ca2+ transients. Conversely, dormant SANC that did not develop automaticity showed no significant change in average LCR characteristics. The majority of dysrhythmic cells became rhythmic in response to βAR stimulation, with the rate of action potential-induced cytosolic Ca2+ transients substantially increasing. In summary, isolated SANC can be broadly categorized into three major populations: dormant, dysrhythmic, and rhythmic. We interpret our results based on simulations of a numerical model of SANC operating as a coupled-clock system. On this basis, the two previously unstudied dysrhythmic and dormant cell populations have intrinsically partially or completely uncoupled clocks. Such cells can be recruited to fire rhythmically in response to βAR stimulation via increased rhythmic LCR activity and ameliorated coupling between the Ca2+ and membrane clocks.

Abstract: Summary
A Ca2+ current transient block (ICaTB) by protons occurs at some ribbon-type synapses after exocytosis, but this has not been observed at mammalian hair cells. Here we show that a robust ICaTB occurs at post-hearing mouse and gerbil inner hair cell (IHC) synapses, but not in immature IHC synapses, which contain non-compact active zones, where Ca2+ channels are loosely coupled to the release sites. Unlike ICaTB at other ribbon synapses, ICaTB in mammalian IHCs displays a surprising multi-peak structure that mirrors the EPSCs seen in paired recordings. Desynchronizing vesicular release with intracellular BAPTA or by deleting otoferlin, the Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis, greatly reduces ICaTB, whereas enhancing release synchronization by raising Ca2+ influx or temperature increases ICaTB. This suggests that ICaTB is produced by fast multivesicular proton-release events. We propose that ICaTB may function as a submillisecond feedback mechanism contributing to the auditory nerve’s fast spike adaptation during sound stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
RNA splicing is a critical mechanism by which to modify transcriptome, and its dysregulation is the underlying cause of many human diseases. It remains challenging, however, to genetically modulate a splicing event in its native context. Here, we demonstrate that a CRISPR-guided cytidine deaminase (i.e., targeted-AID mediated mutagenesis [TAM]) can efficiently modulate various forms of mRNA splicing. By converting invariant guanines to adenines at either 5′ or 3′ splice sites (SS), TAM induces exon skipping, activation of alternative SS, switching between mutually exclusive exons, or targeted intron retention. Conversely, TAM promotes downstream exon inclusion by mutating cytidines into thymines at the polypyrimidine tract. Applying this approach, we genetically restored the open reading frame and dystrophin function of a mutant DMD gene in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Thus, the CRISPR-guided cytidine deaminase provides a versatile genetic platform to modulate RNA splicing and to correct mutations associated with aberrant splicing in human diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Precisely deciphering the molecular mechanisms of age-related memory loss is crucial to create appropriate therapeutic interventions. We have previously shown that the histone-binding protein RbAp48/Rbbp4 is a molecular determinant of Age-Related Memory Loss. By exploring how this protein regulates the genomic landscape of the hippocampal circuit, we find that RbAp48 controls the expression of BDNF and GPR158 proteins, both critical components of osteocalcin (OCN) signaling in the mouse hippocampus. We show that inhibition of RbAp48 in the hippocampal formation inhibits OCN’s beneficial functions in cognition and causes deficits in discrimination memory. In turn, disruption of OCN/GPR158 signaling leads to the downregulation of RbAp48 protein, mimicking the discrimination memory deficits observed in the aged hippocampus. We also show that activation of the OCN/GPR158 pathway increases the expression of RbAp48 in the aged dentate gyrus and rescues age-related memory loss.

Abstract: Summary
cGAS-STING signaling is essential for innate immunity. Its misregulation promotes cancer or autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, and it is imperative to identify effective lead compounds that specifically downregulate the pathway. We report here that astin C, a cyclopeptide isolated from the medicinal plant Aster tataricus, inhibits cGAS-STING signaling and the innate inflammatory responses triggered by cytosolic DNAs. Moreover, mice treated with astin C are more susceptible to HSV-1 infection. Consistently, astin C markedly attenuates the autoinflammatory responses in Trex1−/− BMDM cells and in Trex1−/− mouse autoimmune disease model. Mechanistically, astin C specifically blocks the recruitment of IRF3 onto the STING signalosome. Collectively, this study characterizes a STING-specific small-molecular inhibitor that may be applied for potentially manipulating the STING-mediated clinical diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Particular brain regions and cell populations exhibit increased susceptibility to aging-related stresses. Here, we describe the age-specific and brain-region-specific accumulation of ribosome-associated 3′ UTR RNAs that lack the 5′ UTR and open reading frame. Our study reveals that this phenomenon impacts hundreds of genes in aged D1 spiny projection neurons of the mouse striatum and also occurs in the aging human brain. Isolated 3′ UTR accumulation is tightly correlated with mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative stress, with full-length mRNA expression that is reduced but not eliminated, and with production of short 3′ UTR-encoded peptides. Depletion of the oxidation-sensitive Fe-S cluster ribosome recycling factor ABCE1 induces the accumulation of 3′ UTRs, consistent with a model in which ribosome stalling and mRNA cleavage by No-Go decay yields isolated 3′ UTR RNAs protected by ribosomes. Isolated 3′ UTR accumulation is a hallmark of brain aging, likely reflecting regional differences in metabolism and oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Herein, we report an oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) platform, with genomic annotation useful for co-clinical trial and mechanistic studies. Genomic analysis included whole-exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on 16 tumors and matched PDXs and additional whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on 9 of these pairs as a representative subset of a larger OCSCC PDX repository (n = 63). In 12 models with high purity, more than 90% of variants detected in the tumor were retained in the matched PDX. The genomic landscape across these PDXs reflected OCSCC molecular heterogeneity, including previously described basal, mesenchymal, and classical molecular subtypes. To demonstrate the integration of PDXs into a clinical trial framework, we show that pharmacological intervention in PDXs parallels clinical response and extends patient data. Together, these data describe a repository of OCSCC-specific PDXs and illustrate conservation of primary tumor genotypes, intratumoral heterogeneity, and co-clinical trial application.

Abstract: Summary
Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes are commonly recognized as oncoproteins based on their activation by tumor-promoting phorbol esters. However, accumulating evidence indicates that PKCs can be inhibitory in some cancers, with recent findings propelling a shift in focus to understanding tumor suppressive functions of these enzymes. Here, we report that PKCα acts as a tumor suppressor in PI3K/AKT-driven endometrial cancer. Transcriptional suppression of PKCα is observed in human endometrial tumors in association with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. In murine models, loss of PKCα is rate limiting for endometrial tumor initiation. PKCα tumor suppression involves PP2A-family-dependent inactivation of AKT, which can occur even in the context of genetic hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling by coincident mutations in PTEN, PIK3CA, and/or PIK3R1. Together, our data point to PKCα as a crucial tumor suppressor in the endometrium, with deregulation of a PKCα→PP2A/PP2A-like phosphatase signaling axis contributing to robust AKT activation and enhanced endometrial tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
It remains unclear how memory engrams are altered by experience, such as new learning, to cause forgetting. Here, we report that short-term aversive memory in Drosophila is encoded by and retrieved from the mushroom body output neuron MBOn-γ2α′1. Pairing an odor with aversive electric shock creates a robust depression in the calcium response of MBOn-γ2α′1 and increases avoidance to the paired odor. Electric shock after learning, which activates the cognate dopamine neuron DAn-γ2α′1, restores the response properties of MBOn-γ2α′1 and causes behavioral forgetting. Conditioning with a second odor restores the responses of MBOn-γ2α′1 to a previously learned odor while depressing responses to the newly learned odor, showing that learning and forgetting can occur simultaneously. Moreover, optogenetic activation of DAn-γ2α′1 is sufficient for the bidirectional modulation of MBOn-γ2α′1 response properties. Thus, a single DAn can drive both learning and forgetting by bidirectionally modulating a cellular memory trace.

Abstract: Summary
Deregulated HER2 is a target of many approved cancer drugs. We analyzed 111,176 patient tumors and identified recurrent mutations in HER2 transmembrane domain (TMD) and juxtamembrane domain (JMD) that include G660D, R678Q, E693K, and Q709L. Using a saturation mutagenesis screen and testing of patient-derived mutations we found several activating TMD and JMD mutations. Structural modeling and analysis showed that the TMD/JMD mutations function by improving the active dimer interface or stabilizing an activating conformation. Further, we found that HER2 G660D employed asymmetric kinase dimerization for activation and signaling. Importantly, anti-HER2 antibodies and small-molecule kinase inhibitors blocked the activity of TMD/JMD mutants. Consistent with this, a G660D germline mutant lung cancer patient showed remarkable clinical response to HER2 blockade.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA-binding protein HuD promotes neurogenesis and favors recovery from peripheral axon injury. HuD interacts with many mRNAs, altering both stability and translation efficiency. We generated a nucleotide resolution map of the HuD RNA interactome in motor neuron-like cells, identifying HuD target sites in 1,304 mRNAs, almost exclusively in the 3′ UTR. HuD binds many mRNAs encoding mTORC1-responsive ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Altered HuD expression correlates with the translation efficiency of these mRNAs and overall protein synthesis, in a mTORC1-independent fashion. The predominant HuD target is the abundant, small non-coding RNA Y3, amounting to 70% of the HuD interaction signal. Y3 functions as a molecular sponge for HuD, dynamically limiting its recruitment to polysomes and its activity as a translation and neuron differentiation enhancer. These findings uncover an alternative route to the mTORC1 pathway for translational control in motor neurons that is tunable by a small non-coding RNA.

Abstract: Summary
Histopathological diagnosis of biopsy samples and margin assessment of surgical specimens are challenging aspects in sarcoma. Using dog patient tissues, we assessed the performance of a recently developed technology for fast ex vivo molecular lipid-based diagnosis of sarcomas. The instrument is based on mass spectrometry (MS) molecular analysis through a laser microprobe operating under ambient conditions using excitation of endogenous water molecules. Classification models based on cancer/normal/necrotic, tumor grade, and subtypes showed a minimum of 97.63% correct classification. Specific markers of normal, cancer, and necrotic regions were identified by tandem MS and validated by MS imaging. Real-time detection capabilities were demonstrated by ex vivo analysis with direct interrogation of classification models.

Abstract: Summary
The dynamics of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling underlies its versatile functions in cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and cell motility. Classical studies in Drosophila established that a gradient of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-ERK signaling is essential for these cellular responses. However, we challenge this view by the real-time monitoring of ERK activation; we show that a switch-like ERK activation is essential for the invagination movement of the Drosophila tracheal placode. This switch-like ERK activation stems from the positive feedback regulation of the EGFR-ERK signaling and a resultant relay of EGFR-ERK signaling among tracheal cells. A key transcription factor Trachealess (Trh) permissively regulates the iteration of the relay, and the ERK activation becomes graded in trh mutant. A mathematical model based on these observations and a molecular link between ERK activation dynamics and myosin shows that the relay mechanism efficiently promotes epithelial invagination while the gradient mechanism does not.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting HER2 is effective in 24% of ERBB2 amplified metastatic colorectal cancer; however, secondary resistance occurs in most of the cases. We studied the evolution of individual metastases during treatment to discover spatially resolved determinants of resistance. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis identified alterations associated with resistance in the majority of refractory patients. ctDNA profiles and lesion-specific radiographic reports revealed organ- or metastasis-private evolutionary patterns. When radiologic assessments documented progressive disease in target lesions, response to HER2 blockade was retained in other metastases. Genomic and functional analyses on samples and cell models from eight metastases of a patient co-recruited to a postmortem study unveiled lesion-specific evolutionary trees and pharmacologic vulnerabilities. Lesion size and contribution of distinct metastases to plasma ctDNA were correlated.

Abstract: Summary
IL-10 functions as a suppressor of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer, but it is also a risk locus associated with ulcerative colitis. The mechanism underlying the contrasting roles of IL-10 in inflammation and colon cancer is unknown. We report here that inflammation induces the accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that express high levels of IL-10 in colon tissue. IL-10 induces the activation of STAT3 that directly binds to the Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b promoters to activate their expression, resulting in DNA hypermethylation at the Irf8 promoter to silence IRF8 expression in colon epithelial cells. Mice with Irf8 deleted in colonic epithelial cells exhibit significantly higher inflammation-induced tumor incidence. Human colorectal carcinomas have significantly higher DNMT1 and DNMT3b and lower IRF8 expression, and they exhibit significantly higher IRF8 promoter DNA methylation than normal colon. Our data identify the MDSC-IL-10-STAT3-DNMT3b-IRF8 pathway as a link between chronic inflammation and colon cancer initiation.

Abstract: Summary
Copy-number changes generate phenotypic variability in health and disease. Whether organisms protect against copy-number changes is largely unknown. Here, we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae monitors the copy number of its ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and rapidly responds to copy-number loss with the clonal amplification of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) from chromosomal repeats. ERC formation is replicative, separable from repeat loss, and reaches a dynamic steady state that responds to the addition of exogenous rDNA copies. ERC levels are also modulated by RNAPI activity and diet, suggesting that rDNA copy number is calibrated against the cellular demand for rRNA. Last, we show that ERCs reinsert into the genome in a dosage-dependent manner, indicating that they provide a reservoir for ultimately increasing rDNA array length. Our results reveal a DNA-based mechanism for rapidly restoring copy number in response to catastrophic gene loss that shares fundamental features with unscheduled copy-number amplifications in cancer cells.
