Abstract: Summary
Tumor cells initiate platelet activation leading to the secretion of bioactive molecules, which promote metastasis. Platelet receptors on tumors have not been well-characterized, resulting in a critical gap in knowledge concerning platelet-promoted metastasis. We identify a direct interaction between platelets and tumor CD97 that stimulates rapid bidirectional signaling. CD97, an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is an overexpressed tumor antigen in several cancer types. Purified CD97 extracellular domain or tumor cell-associated CD97 stimulated platelet activation. CD97-initiated platelet activation led to granule secretion, including the release of ATP, a mediator of endothelial junction disruption. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) derived from platelets induced tumor invasiveness via proximal CD97-LPAR heterodimer signaling, coupling coincident tumor cell migration and vascular permeability to promote transendothelial migration. Consistent with this, CD97 was necessary for tumor cell-induced vascular permeability in vivo and metastasis formation in preclinical models. These findings support targeted blockade of tumor CD97 as an approach to ameliorate metastatic spread.

Abstract: Bone resorption is mainly mediated by osteoclasts (OCs), whose formation and function are regulated by intracellular Ca2+ oscillation. Our previous studies demonstrated that fluid shear stress (FSS) lead to Ca2+ oscillation through mechanosensitive cation-selective channels. However, the specific channels responsible for this FSS-induced Ca2+ oscillation remain unknown. In the present study, we examined the expression of several Ca2+ channels in OCs, including STIM1, ORAI1, TRPV1, TRPV4, TRPV5, and TRPV6, by western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that STIM1 was highly expressed in early stage OCs, while TRPV4 was highly expressed in late stage OCs. We observed intracellular Ca2+ responses in OCs that were mechanically stimulated by FSS. When we blocked STIM1-dependent store-operated Ca2+ entry or inhibited TRPV4 using siRNA or drug inhibition, FSS-induced Ca2+ oscillations were almost undetectable in early and late stage OCs, respectively. These results indicate that STIM1 and TRPV4 act as mechanical transduction channels for OCs during the early and late differentiation stages, respectively, suggesting that these calcium channel could serve as markers of osteoclastogenesis or bone resorption.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria shape is controlled by membrane fusion and fission mediated by mitofusins, Opa1, and Drp1, whereas mitochondrial motility relies on microtubule motors. These processes govern mitochondria subcellular distribution, whose defects are emphasized in neurons because of their polarized structure. We have studied how perturbation of the fusion/fission balance affects mitochondria distribution in Drosophila axons. Knockdown of Marf or Opa1 resulted in progressive loss of distal mitochondria and in a distinct oxidative phosphorylation and membrane potential deficit. Downregulation of Drp1 rescued the lethality and bioenergetic defect caused by neuronal Marf RNAi, but induced only a modest restoration of axonal mitochondria distribution. Surprisingly, Drp1 knockdown rescued fragmentation and fully restored aberrant distribution of axonal mitochondria produced by Opa1 RNAi; however, Drp1 knockdown did not improve viability or mitochondria function. Our data show that proper morphology is critical for proper axonal mitochondria distribution independent of bioenergetic efficiency. The health of neurons largely depends on mitochondria function, but does not depend on shape or distribution.

Abstract: Summary
Typhoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovar (S.) Typhi differs in its clinical presentation from gastroenteritis caused by S. Typhimurium and other non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars. The different clinical presentations are attributed in part to the virulence-associated capsular polysaccharide (Vi antigen) of S. Typhi, which prevents phagocytes from triggering a respiratory burst by preventing antibody-mediated complement activation. Paradoxically, the Vi antigen is absent from S. Paratyphi A, which causes a disease that is indistinguishable from typhoid fever. Here, we show that evasion of the phagocyte respiratory burst by S. Paratyphi A required very long O antigen chains containing the O2 antigen to inhibit antibody binding. We conclude that the ability to avoid the phagocyte respiratory burst is a property distinguishing typhoidal from non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars that was acquired by S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A independently through convergent evolution.

Abstract: Summary
The antidiabetic potential of glucagon receptor antagonism presents an opportunity for use in an insulin-centric clinical environment. To investigate the metabolic effects of glucagon receptor antagonism in type 2 diabetes, we treated Leprdb/db and Lepob/ob mice with REMD 2.59, a human monoclonal antibody and competitive antagonist of the glucagon receptor. As expected, REMD 2.59 suppresses hepatic glucose production and improves glycemia. Surprisingly, it also enhances insulin action in both liver and skeletal muscle, coinciding with an increase in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated lipid oxidation. Furthermore, weekly REMD 2.59 treatment over a period of months protects against diabetic cardiomyopathy. These functional improvements are not derived simply from correcting the systemic milieu; nondiabetic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of lipoprotein lipase also show improvements in contractile function after REMD 2.59 treatment. These observations suggest that hyperglucagonemia enables lipotoxic conditions, allowing the development of insulin resistance and cardiac dysfunction during disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Spatial control of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, which is used by cells to translate complex information into distinct downstream responses, is achieved by using plasma membrane (PM) and endocytic-derived signaling pathways. The roles of the endomembrane in regulating such pleiotropic signaling via multiple G-protein pathways remain unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of disease-causing mutations of the adaptor protein-2 σ subunit (AP2σ) on signaling by the class C GPCR calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). These AP2σ mutations increase CaSR PM expression yet paradoxically reduce CaSR signaling. Hypercalcemia-associated AP2σ mutations reduced CaSR signaling via Gαq/11 and Gαi/o pathways. The mutations also delayed CaSR internalization due to prolonged residency time of CaSR in clathrin structures that impaired or abolished endosomal signaling, which was predominantly mediated by Gαq/11. Thus, compartmental bias for CaSR-mediated Gαq/11 endomembrane signaling provides a mechanistic basis for multidimensional GPCR signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Telomeres and telomere-binding proteins form complex secondary nucleoprotein structures that are critical for genome integrity but can present serious challenges during telomere DNA replication. It remains unclear how telomere replication stress is resolved during S phase. Here, we show that the BUB3-BUB1 complex, a component in spindle assembly checkpoint, binds to telomeres during S phase and promotes telomere DNA replication. Loss of the BUB3-BUB1 complex results in telomere replication defects, including fragile and shortened telomeres. We also demonstrate that the telomere-binding ability of BUB3 and kinase activity of BUB1 are indispensable to BUB3-BUB1 function at telomeres. TRF2 targets BUB1-BUB3 to telomeres, and BUB1 can directly phosphorylate TRF1 and promote TRF1 recruitment of BLM helicase to overcome replication stress. Our findings have uncovered previously unknown roles for the BUB3-BUB1 complex in S phase and shed light on how proteins from diverse pathways function coordinately to ensure proper telomere replication and maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Sirtuin 2 is a nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase that regulates cell processes such as carcinogenesis, cell cycle, DNA damage, and infection. Subcellular localization of SIRT2 is crucial for its function but is poorly understood. Infection with the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, which relocalizes SIRT2 from the cytoplasm to the chromatin, provides an ideal stimulus for the molecular study of this process. In this report, we provide a map of SIRT2 post-translational modification sites and focus on serine 25 phosphorylation. We show that infection specifically induces dephosphorylation of S25, an event essential for SIRT2 chromatin association. Furthermore, we identify a nuclear complex formed by the phosphatases PPM1A and PPM1B, with SIRT2 essential for controlling H3K18 deacetylation and SIRT2-mediated gene repression during infection and necessary for a productive Listeria infection. This study reveals a molecular mechanism regulating SIRT2 function and localization, paving the way for understanding other SIRT2-regulated cellular processes.

Abstract: Summary
The yeast INO80 chromatin remodeling complex plays essential roles in regulating DNA damage repair, replication, and promoter architecture. INO80’s role in these processes is likely related to its ability to slide nucleosomes, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we use ensemble and single-molecule enzymology to study INO80-catalyzed nucleosome sliding. We find that the rate of nucleosome sliding by INO80 increases ∼100-fold when the flanking DNA length is increased from 40 to 60 bp. Furthermore, once sliding is initiated, INO80 moves the nucleosome rapidly at least 20 bp without pausing to re-assess flanking DNA length, and it can change the direction of nucleosome sliding without dissociation. Finally, we show that the Nhp10 module of INO80 plays an auto-inhibitory role, tuning INO80’s switch-like response to flanking DNA. Our results indicate that INO80 is a highly processive remodeling motor that is tightly regulated by both substrate cues and non-catalytic subunits.

Abstract: Summary
PRC2 is a therapeutic target for several types of cancers currently undergoing clinical trials. Its activity is regulated by a positive feedback loop whereby its terminal enzymatic product, H3K27me3, is specifically recognized and bound by an aromatic cage present in its EED subunit. The ensuing allosteric activation of the complex stimulates H3K27me3 deposition on chromatin. Here we report a stepwise feedback mechanism entailing key residues within distinctive interfacing motifs of EZH2 or EED that are found to be mutated in cancers and/or Weaver syndrome. PRC2 harboring these EZH2 or EED mutants manifested little activity in vivo but, unexpectedly, exhibited similar chromatin association as wild-type PRC2, indicating an uncoupling of PRC2 activity and recruitment. With genetic and chemical tools, we demonstrated that targeting allosteric activation overrode the gain-of-function effect of EZH2Y646X oncogenic mutations. These results revealed critical implications for the regulation and biology of PRC2 and a vulnerability in tackling PRC2-addicted cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Skp1⋅Cul1⋅F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase assembly is regulated by the interplay of substrate binding, reversible Nedd8 conjugation on Cul1, and the F-box protein (FBP) exchange factors Cand1 and Cand2. Detailed investigations into SCF assembly and function in reconstituted systems and Cand1/2 knockout cells informed the development of a mathematical model for how dynamical assembly of SCF complexes is controlled and how this cycle is coupled to degradation of an SCF substrate. Simulations predicted an unanticipated hypersensitivity of Cand1/2-deficient cells to FBP expression levels, which was experimentally validated. Together, these and prior observations lead us to propose the adaptive exchange hypothesis, which posits that regulation of the koff of an FBP from SCF by the actions of substrate, Nedd8, and Cand1 molds the cellular repertoire of SCF complexes and that the plasticity afforded by this exchange mechanism may enable large variations in FBP expression during development and in FBP gene number during evolution.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas provides RNA-guided adaptive immunity against invading genetic elements. Interference in type I systems relies on the RNA-guided Cascade complex for target DNA recognition and the Cas3 helicase/nuclease protein for target degradation. Even though the biochemistry of CRISPR interference has been largely covered, the biophysics of DNA unwinding and coupling of the helicase and nuclease domains of Cas3 remains elusive. Here, we employed single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to probe the helicase activity with high spatiotemporal resolution. We show that Cas3 remains tightly associated with the target-bound Cascade complex while reeling the DNA using a spring-loaded mechanism. This spring-loaded reeling occurs in distinct bursts of 3 bp, which underlie three successive 1-nt unwinding events. Reeling is highly repetitive, allowing Cas3 to repeatedly present its inefficient nuclease domain with single-strand DNA (ssDNA) substrate. Our study reveals that the discontinuous helicase properties of Cas3 and its tight interaction with Cascade ensure controlled degradation of target DNA only.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to acting as building blocks for biosynthesis, amino acids might serve as signaling regulators in various physiological and pathological processes. However, it remains unknown whether amino acid levels affect the activities of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). By using a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor of the intracellular levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), we could monitor the dynamics of BCAA metabolism in HSCs. A mitochondrial-targeted 2C-type Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (PPM1K) promotes the catabolism of BCAAs to maintain MEIS1 and p21 levels by decreasing the ubiquitination-mediated degradation controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CDC20. PPM1K deficiency led to a notable decrease in MEIS1/p21 signaling to reduce the glycolysis and quiescence of HSCs, followed by a severe impairment in repopulation activities. Moreover, the deletion of Ppm1k dramatically extended survival in a murine leukemia model. These findings will enhance the current understanding of nutrient signaling in metabolism and function of stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
mRNA cap addition occurs early during RNA Pol II-dependent transcription, facilitating pre-mRNA processing and translation. We report that the mammalian mRNA cap methyltransferase, RNMT-RAM, promotes RNA Pol II transcription independent of mRNA capping and translation. In cells, sublethal suppression of RNMT-RAM reduces RNA Pol II occupancy, net mRNA synthesis, and pre-mRNA levels. Conversely, expression of RNMT-RAM increases transcription independent of cap methyltransferase activity. In isolated nuclei, recombinant RNMT-RAM stimulates transcriptional output; this requires the RAM RNA binding domain. RNMT-RAM interacts with nascent transcripts along their entire length and with transcription-associated factors including the RNA Pol II subunits SPT4, SPT6, and PAFc. Suppression of RNMT-RAM inhibits transcriptional markers including histone H2BK120 ubiquitination, H3K4 and H3K36 methylation, RNA Pol II CTD S5 and S2 phosphorylation, and PAFc recruitment. These findings suggest that multiple interactions among RNMT-RAM, RNA Pol II factors, and RNA along the transcription unit stimulate transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic itch or pruritus is a debilitating disorder that is refractory to conventional anti-histamine treatment. Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists have been used to treat chronic itch, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we find that KOR and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) overlap in the spinal cord, and KOR activation attenuated GRPR-mediated histamine-independent acute and chronic itch in mice. Notably, canonical KOR-mediated Gαi signaling is not required for desensitizing GRPR function. In vivo and in vitro studies suggest that KOR activation results in the translocation of Ca2+-independent protein kinase C (PKC)δ from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits GRPR activity. A blockade of phospholipase C (PLC) in HEK293 cells prevented KOR-agonist-induced PKCδ translocation and GRPR phosphorylation, suggesting a role of PLC signaling in KOR-mediated GRPR desensitization. These data suggest that a KOR-PLC-PKCδ-GRPR signaling pathway in the spinal cord may underlie KOR-agonists-induced anti-pruritus therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) perceive microbial and endogenous molecular patterns to activate immune signaling. The cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 acts downstream of multiple PRRs as a rate-limiting component, whose phosphorylation and accumulation are central to immune signal propagation. Previous work identified the calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK28 and heterotrimeric G proteins as negative and positive regulators of BIK1 accumulation, respectively. However, mechanisms underlying this regulation remain unknown. Here we show that the plant U-box proteins PUB25 and PUB26 are homologous E3 ligases that mark BIK1 for degradation to negatively regulate immunity. We demonstrate that the heterotrimeric G proteins inhibit PUB25/26 activity to stabilize BIK1, whereas CPK28 specifically phosphorylates conserved residues in PUB25/26 to enhance their activity and promote BIK1 degradation. Interestingly, PUB25/26 specifically target non-activated BIK1, suggesting that activated BIK1 is maintained for immune signaling. Our findings reveal a multi-protein regulatory module that enables robust yet tightly regulated immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative mRNA processing is a critical mechanism for proteome expansion and gene regulation in higher eukaryotes. The SR family proteins play important roles in splicing regulation. Intriguingly, mammalian genomes encode many poorly characterized SR-like proteins, including subunits of the mRNA 3′-processing factor CFIm, CFIm68 and CFIm59. Here we demonstrate that CFIm functions as an enhancer-dependent activator of mRNA 3′ processing. CFIm regulates global alternative polyadenylation (APA) by specifically binding and activating enhancer-containing poly(A) sites (PASs). Importantly, the CFIm activator functions are mediated by the arginine-serine repeat (RS) domains of CFIm68/59, which bind specifically to an RS-like region in the CPSF subunit Fip1, and this interaction is inhibited by CFIm68/59 hyper-phosphorylation. The remarkable functional similarities between CFIm and SR proteins suggest that interactions between RS-like domains in regulatory and core factors may provide a common activation mechanism for mRNA 3′ processing, splicing, and potentially other steps in RNA metabolism.

Abstract: The P2X7R protein, a P2 type purinergic receptor functioning as a non-selective cation channel, is expressed in different cell types of the central nervous system in several regions of the brain. The activation of the P2X7R protein by ATP modulates excitatory neurotransmission and contributes to microglial activation, apoptosis and neuron-glia communication. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that is highly concentrated in the synaptic vesicles of glutamatergic hippocampal neurons where free zinc ions released into the synaptic cleft alter glutamatergic signal transmission. Changes in both P2X7R-mediated signaling and brain zinc homeostasis have been implicated in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. Here, we tested the hypothesis that extracellular zinc regulates P2X7R activity in the hippocampus. We observed that P2X7R is expressed in both neurons and glial cells in primary mouse hippocampal neuron-glia culture. Propidium iodide (PI) uptake through large pores formed by pannexins and P2X7R was dose-dependently inhibited by extracellular zinc ions. Calcium influx mediated by P2X7R in glial cells was also reduced by free zinc ions. Interestingly, no calcium influx was detected in response to ATP or 3′-O-(4-Benzoyl) benzoyl ATP (BzATP) in neurons despite the expression of P2X7R at the plasma membrane. Our results show that free zinc ions can modulate hippocampal glial purinergic signaling, and changes in the activity of P2X7R may contribute to the development of depression-like behaviors associated with zinc deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Ebola virus (EBOV), isolate Makona, the causative agent of the West African EBOV epidemic, has been the subject of numerous investigations to determine the genetic diversity and its potential implication for virus biology, pathogenicity, and transmissibility. Despite various mutations that have emerged over time through multiple human-to-human transmission chains, their biological relevance remains questionable. Recently, mutations in the glycoprotein GP and polymerase L, which emerged and stabilized early during the outbreak, have been associated with improved viral fitness in cell culture. Here, we infected mice and rhesus macaques with EBOV-Makona isolates carrying or lacking those mutations. Surprisingly, all isolates behaved very similarly independent of the genotype, causing severe or lethal disease in mice and macaques, respectively. Likewise, we could not detect any evidence for differences in virus shedding. Thus, no specific biological phenotype could be associated with these EBOV-Makona mutations in two animal models.

Abstract: Summary
TGF-β has been demonstrated to promote tumor metastasis, and the regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report the role of USP2a in promoting metastasis by facilitating TGF-β-triggered signaling. USP2a interacts with TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 upon TGF-β stimulation and removes K33-linked polyubiquitin chains from Lys502 of TGFBR1, promoting the recruitment of SMAD2/3. Simultaneously, TGFBR2 phosphorylates Ser207/Ser225 of USP2a, leading to the disassociation of SMAD2/3 from TGFBR1. The phosphorylation of USP2a and SMAD2 is positively correlated in human tumor biopsies, and USP2a is hyper-phosphorylated in lung adenocarcinomas with lymph node invasion. Depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of USP2a dampens TGF-β-triggered signaling and metastasis. Our findings have characterized an essential role of USP2a as a potential target for treatment of metastatic cancers.

Abstract: Summary
KRAS can bind numerous effector proteins, which activate different downstream signaling events. The best known are RAF, phosphatidylinositide (PI)-3′ kinase, and RalGDS families, but many additional direct and indirect effectors have been reported. We have assessed how these effectors contribute to several major phenotypes in a quantitative way, using an arrayed combinatorial siRNA screen in which we knocked down 41 KRAS effectors nodes in 92 cell lines. We show that every cell line has a unique combination of effector dependencies, but in spite of this heterogeneity, we were able to identify two major subtypes of KRAS mutant cancers of the lung, pancreas, and large intestine, which reflect different KRAS effector engagement and opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane surface charge is critical for the transient, yet specific recruitment of proteins with polybasic regions to certain organelles. In eukaryotes, the plasma membrane (PM) is the most electronegative compartment of the cell, which specifies its identity. As such, membrane electrostatics is a central parameter in signaling, intracellular trafficking, and polarity. Here, we explore which are the lipids that control membrane electrostatics using plants as a model. We show that phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), phosphatidic acidic (PA), and phosphatidylserine (PS) are separately required to generate the electrostatic signature of the plant PM. In addition, we reveal the existence of an electrostatic territory that is organized as a gradient along the endocytic pathway and is controlled by PS/PI4P combination. Altogether, we propose that combinatorial lipid composition of the cytosolic leaflet of organelles not only defines the electrostatic territory but also distinguishes different functional compartments within this territory by specifying their varying surface charges.

Abstract: Summary
Microorganisms evolved adaptive responses to survive stressful challenges in ever-changing environments. Understanding the relationships between the physiological/metabolic adjustments allowing cellular stress adaptation and gene expression changes being used by organisms to achieve such adjustments may significantly impact our ability to understand and/or guide evolution. Here, we studied those relationships during adaptation to various stress challenges in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, focusing on heat stress responses. We combined dozens of independent experiments measuring whole-genome gene expression changes during stress responses with a simplified kinetic model of central metabolism. We identified alternative quantitative ranges for a set of physiological variables in the model (production of ATP, trehalose, NADH, etc.) that are specific for adaptation to either heat stress or desiccation/rehydration. Our approach is scalable to other adaptive responses and could assist in developing biotechnological applications to manipulate cells for medical, biotechnological, or synthetic biology purposes.

Abstract: This investigation was aimed at working out the combined role of lncRNA H19, miR-29b and Wnt signaling in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). In the aggregate, 185 CRC tissues and corresponding para-carcinoma tissues were gathered. The human CRC cell lines (i.e. HT29, HCT116, SW480 and SW620) and normal colorectal mucosa cell line (NCM460) were also purchased. Si-H19, si-NC, miR-29b-3p mimics, miR-29b-3p inhibitor, si-PGRN and negative control (NC) were, respectively, transfected into the CRC cells. Lucif-erase reporter plasmids were prepared to evaluate the transduction activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was arranged to confirm the targeted relationship between H19 and miR-29b-3p, as well as between miR-29b-3p and PGRN. Finally, the proliferative and invasive capacities of CRC cells were appraised through transwell, MTT and scratch assays. As a result, over-expressed H19 and down-expressed miR-29b-3p displayed close associations with the CRC patients’ poor prognosis (P < 0.05). Besides, transfection with si-H19, miR-29b-3p mimic or si-PGRN were correlated with elevated E-cadherin expression, decreased snail and vimentin expressions, as well as less-motivated cell proliferation and cell metastasis (P < 0.05). Moreover, H19 was verified to directly target miR-29b-3p based on the luciferase reporter gene assay (P < 0.05), and miR-29b-3p also bound to PGRN in a direct manner (P < 0.05). Finally, addition of LiCl (Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator) or XAV93920 (Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor) would cause remarkably altered E-cadherin, c-Myc, vimentin and snail expressions, as well as significantly changed transcriptional activity of β-catenin/Tcf reporter plasmid (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the lncRNA H19/miR-29b-3p/PGRN/Wnt axis counted a great deal for seeking appropriate diagnostic biomarkers and treatment targets for CRC.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro screening of signaling molecules involved in neural circuit formation has identified a large number of synaptogenic proteins. However, factors that drive synapse elimination remain elusive. Here, we report that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) released from axons has the ability to eliminate synapses. We found fast axonal transport of BMP4 in dense-core vesicles, its exocytosis, and subsequent cell surface clustering via type I BMP receptors near synapses. BMP4 overexpression or knockout in culture reduced or increased presynaptic structures, respectively. The destabilizing effect of surface BMP4 clusters was limited to nearby synapses. In vivo knockout of BMP4 and subsequent two-photon imaging of synapse dynamics confirmed its critical role in maintaining an appropriate density of presynaptic components along the axon. These results suggest an essential role for perisynaptic clustering of BMP4 during development in the construction of functional neuronal circuits.

Abstract: Summary
The access-repair-restore model for the role of chromatin in DNA repair infers that chromatin is a mere obstacle to DNA repair. However, here we show that blocking chromatin assembly, via knockdown of the histone chaperones ASF1 or CAF-1 or a mutation that prevents ASF1A binding to histones, hinders Rad51 loading onto ssDNA during homologous recombination. This is a consequence of reduced recruitment of the Rad51 loader MMS22L-TONSL to ssDNA, resulting in persistent RPA foci, extensive DNA end resection, persistent activation of the ATR-Chk1 pathway, and cell cycle arrest. In agreement, histones occupy ssDNA during DNA repair in yeast. We also uncovered DNA-PKcs-dependent DNA damage-induced ASF1A phosphorylation, which enhances chromatin assembly, promoting MMS22L-TONSL recruitment and, hence, Rad51 loading. We propose that transient assembly of newly synthesized histones onto ssDNA serves to recruit MMS22L-TONSL to efficiently form the Rad51 nucleofilament for strand invasion, suggesting an active role of chromatin assembly in homologous recombination.

Abstract: Summary
Approximately 30% of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) exhibit functional loss of the RB tumor suppressor, suggesting a target for precision intervention. Here, we use drug screens to identify agents specifically antagonized by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) using CDK4/6 inhibitors. A number of candidate RB-synthetic lethal small molecules were identified, including anti-helmenthics, chemotherapeutic agents, and small-molecule inhibitors targeting DNA-damage checkpoints (e.g., CHK) and chromosome segregation (e.g., PLK1). Counter-screens using isogenic TNBC tumor cell lines and cell panels with varying endogenous RB statuses confirmed that therapeutic effects were robust and selective for RB loss of function. By analyzing TNBC clinical specimens, RB-deficient tumors were found to express high levels of CHK1 and PLK1. Loss of RB specifically resulted in loss of checkpoint functions governing DNA replication, yielding increased drug sensitivity. Xenograft models demonstrated RB-selective efficacy of CHK inhibitors. This study supports the possibility of selectively targeting RB loss in the treatment of TNBC.

Reduced calcium influx in the hypoxia-tolerant Spalax: The role of the erythropoietin receptor,

Abstract: Tissue hypoxia is a condition that induces calcium influx into living cells. Calcium is a major player in maintaining cell signaling and homeostasis, and mediates the regulation of gene transcription and cell proliferation; however, acute and aggressive calcium influx induced by hypoxia eventually leads to programmed cell death. The blind mole rat, Spalax, is a wild-spread burrowing mammal adapted to hypoxic environments. A tyrosine -to- phenylalanine (F481 in Spalax corresponding to Y485 in human full-length receptor; Y460 in human mature form) substitution is found in the erythropoietin receptor of Spalax and other species, which was previously shown to be strongly involved in the calcium channels activation and subsequent calcium influx. The current work aimed to explore the dynamics of calcium transport across Spalax nonhematopoietic cells’ membrane compared to above ground rat and mouse, and the role of the erythropoietin receptor of Spalax in the regulation of calcium influx under hypoxia. We show here that Epo-induced calcium influx in HEK293 cells transfected with Spalax EpoR is significantly lower than that of mouse; in hypoxia this difference was even more pronounced. Western blots confirmed a significant increase of Erk phosphorylation after stimulation with erythropoietin under hypoxia in cells transfected with mouse full length erythropoietin receptor compared to Spalax. Native primary fibroblasts showed lower cytosolic calcium concentrations in Spalax cells when compared to those of rats under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Spalax EpoR appears to play an important role in preventing deleterious consequences of hypoxia and maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress.

Abstract: Summary
The extent to which microbiota alterations define or influence the outcome of metabolic diseases is still unclear, but the byproducts of microbiota metabolism are known to have an important role in mediating the host-microbiota interaction. Here, we identify that in both pre-clinical and clinical settings, metabolic syndrome is associated with the reduced capacity of the microbiota to metabolize tryptophan into derivatives that are able to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. This alteration is not merely an effect of the disease as supplementation with AhR agonist or a Lactobacillus strain, with a high AhR ligand-production capacity, leads to improvement of both dietary- and genetic-induced metabolic impairments, particularly glucose dysmetabolism and liver steatosis, through improvement of intestinal barrier function and secretion of the incretin hormone GLP-1. These results highlight the role of gut microbiota-derived metabolites as a biomarker and as a basis for novel preventative or therapeutic interventions for metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Erroneous DNA repair by heterologous recombination (Ht-REC) is a potential threat to genome stability, but evidence supporting its prevalence is lacking. Here we demonstrate that recombination is possible between heterologous sequences and that it is a source of chromosomal alterations in mitotic and meiotic cells. Mechanistically, we find that the RTEL1 and HIM-6/BLM helicases and the BRCA1 homolog BRC-1 counteract Ht-REC in Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas mismatch repair does not. Instead, MSH-2/6 drives Ht-REC events in rtel-1 and brc-1 mutants and excessive crossovers in rtel-1 mutant meioses. Loss of vertebrate Rtel1 also causes a variety of unusually large and complex structural variations, including chromothripsis, breakage-fusion-bridge events, and tandem duplications with distant intra-chromosomal insertions, whose structure are consistent with a role for RTEL1 in preventing Ht-REC during break-induced replication. Our data establish Ht-REC as an unappreciated source of genome instability that underpins a novel class of complex genome rearrangements that likely arise during replication stress.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional enhancers, including super-enhancers (SEs), form physical interactions with promoters to regulate cell-type-specific gene expression. SEs are characterized by high transcription factor occupancy and large domains of active chromatin, and they are commonly assigned to target promoters using computational predictions. How promoter-SE interactions change upon cell state transitions, and whether transcription factors maintain SE interactions, have not been reported. Here, we used promoter-capture Hi-C to identify promoters that interact with SEs in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We found that SEs form complex, spatial networks in which individual SEs contact multiple promoters, and a rewiring of promoter-SE interactions occurs between pluripotent states. We also show that long-range promoter-SE interactions are more prevalent in ESCs than in epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) or Nanog-deficient ESCs. We conclude that SEs form cell-type-specific interaction networks that are partly dependent on core transcription factors, thereby providing insights into the gene regulatory organization of pluripotent cells.

Abstract: Summary
Conventional type 1 DCs (cDC1s) excel at cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens partly because they express DNGR-1, a receptor that recognizes exposed actin filaments on dead cells. In vitro polymerized F-actin can be used as a synthetic ligand for DNGR-1. However, cellular F-actin is decorated with actin-binding proteins, which could affect DNGR-1 recognition. Here, we demonstrate that myosin II, an F-actin-associated motor protein, greatly potentiates the binding of DNGR-1 to F-actin. Latex beads coated with F-actin and myosin II are taken up by DNGR-1+ cDC1s, and antigen associated with those beads is efficiently cross-presented to CD8+ T cells. Myosin II-deficient necrotic cells are impaired in their ability to stimulate DNGR-1 or to serve as substrates for cDC1 cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells. These results provide insights into the nature of the DNGR-1 ligand and have implications for understanding immune responses to cell-associated antigens and for vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental task for the brain is to determine which aspects of the continuous flow of information is the most relevant in a given behavioral situation. The information flow is regulated via dynamic interactions between feedforward and feedback pathways. One such pathway is via corticothalamic feedback. Layer 6 (L6) corticothalamic (CT) cells make both cortical and thalamic connections and, therefore, are key modulators of activity in both areas. The functional properties of L6 CT cells in sensory processing were investigated in the mouse whisker system. Optogenetic activation of L6 CT neurons decreased spontaneous spiking, with the net effect that a whisker-evoked response was more accurately detected (larger evoked-to-spontaneous spiking ratio) but at the expense of reducing the response probability. In addition, L6 CT activation decreases sensory adaptation in both the thalamus and cortex. L6 CT activity can thus tune the tactile system, depending on the behaviorally relevant tactile input.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) proteins are critical regulators of innate immune signaling pathways and therefore have potential as drug targets. X-linked IAP (XIAP) and cellular IAP1 and IAP2 (cIAP1 and cIAP2) are E3 ligases that have been shown to be required for signaling downstream of NOD2, an intracellular receptor for bacterial peptidoglycan. We used genetic and biochemical approaches to compare the responses of IAP-deficient mice and cells to NOD2 stimulation. In all cell types tested, XIAP is the only IAP required for signaling immediately downstream of NOD2, while cIAP1 and cIAP2 are dispensable for NOD2-induced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. However, mice lacking cIAP1 or TNFR1 have a blunted cytokine response to NOD2 stimulation. We conclude that cIAPs regulate NOD2-dependent autocrine TNF signaling in vivo and highlight the importance of physiological context in the interplay of innate immune signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
The biogenesis of the RNA payload of mature sperm is of great interest, because RNAs delivered to the zygote at fertilization can affect early development. Here, we tested the hypothesis that small RNAs are trafficked to mammalian sperm during the process of post-testicular maturation in the epididymis. By characterizing small RNA dynamics during germ cell maturation in mice, we confirm and extend prior observations that sperm undergo a dramatic switch in the RNA payload from piRNAs to tRNA fragments (tRFs) upon exiting the testis and entering the epididymis. Small RNA delivery to sperm could be recapitulated in vitro by incubating testicular spermatozoa with caput epididymosomes. Finally, tissue-specific metabolic labeling of RNAs in intact mice definitively shows that mature sperm carry RNAs that were originally synthesized in the epididymal epithelium. These data demonstrate that soma-germline RNA transfer occurs in male mammals, most likely via vesicular transport from the epididymis to maturing sperm.

Abstract: Summary
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have been suggested as the master regulators of adipose tissue formation. However, their role in regulating brown fat functionality has not been resolved. To address this question, we generated mice with inducible brown fat-specific deletions of PPARα, β/δ, and γ, respectively. We found that both PPARα and β/δδ are dispensable for brown fat function. In contrast, we could show that ablation of PPARγ in vitro and in vivo led to a reduced thermogenic capacity accompanied by a loss of inducibility by β-adrenergic signaling, as well as a shift from oxidative fatty acid metabolism to glucose utilization. We identified glycerol kinase (Gyk) as a partial mediator of PPARγ function and could show that Gyk expression correlates with brown fat thermogenic capacity in human brown fat biopsies. Thus, Gyk might constitute the link between PPARγ-mediated regulation of brown fat function and activation by β-adrenergic signaling.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is resistant to treatment and needs precision individualized therapy to improve the outcome of this disease. Previously, we demonstrated that trametinib (TRA), a MEK inhibitor, could inhibit a pancreatic cancer patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX). In the present study, we show that gemcitabine (GEM) in combination with TRA was more effective than TRA alone. We implanted a patient pancreatic cancer orthotopically in the pancreatic tail of nude mice to establish the PDOX model. After seven weeks of tumor growth, we divided 32 pancreatic-cancer PDOX nude mice into 4 groups of eight: untreated control; GEM (once a week for 2 weeks); TRA (14 consecutive days); GEM + TRA (GEM: once a week for 2 weeks, TRA:14 consecutive days). We found that treated mice on day 14 had significantly reduced tumor volume in comparison to untreated control. TRA and the combination of GEM + TRA therapy significantly inhibited tumor development in comparison to GEM alone. However, GEM + TRA inhibited the PDOX tumor growth significantly greater than TRA alone. These results suggest the clinical potential of the combination of TRA and GEM for pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The locomotion of C. elegans is balanced by excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions. However, the molecular mechanisms that maintain the balance of synaptic transmission remain enigmatic. Here, we investigated the function of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in triggering spontaneous release at cholinergic and GABAergic synapses. Recordings of the miniature excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) showed that UNC-2/CaV2 and EGL-19/CaV1 channels are the two major triggers for spontaneous release. Notably, however, Ca2+-independent spontaneous release was observed at GABAergic but not cholinergic synapses. Functional screening led to the identification of hypomorphic unc-64/Syntaxin-1A and snb-1/VAMP2 mutants in which mEPSCs are severely impaired, whereas mIPSCs remain unaltered, indicating differential regulation of these currents at cholinergic and GABAergic synapses. Moreover, Ca2+-independent spontaneous GABA release was nearly abolished in the hypomorphic unc-64 and snb-1 mutants, suggesting distinct mechanisms for Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent spontaneous release.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary habits that can induce inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are major colorectal cancer (CRC) risk factors, but mechanisms linking nutrients, IBD, and CRC are unknown. Using human data and mouse models, we show that mTORC1 inactivation-induced chromosomal instability impairs intestinal crypt proliferation and regeneration, CDK4/6 dependently. This triggers interleukin (IL)-6-associated reparative inflammation, inducing crypt hyper-proliferation, wound healing, and CRC. Blocking IL-6 signaling or reactivating mTORC1 reduces inflammation-induced CRC, so mTORC1 activation suppresses tumorigenesis in IBD. Conversely, mTORC1 inactivation is beneficial in APC loss-dependent CRC. Thus, IL-6 blockers or protein-rich-diet-linked mTORC1 activation may prevent IBD-associated CRC. However, abolishing mTORC1 can mitigate CRC in predisposed patients with APC mutations. Our work reveals mTORC1 oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles in intestinal epithelium and avenues to optimized and personalized therapeutic regimens for CRC.

Abstract: Mast cells in the peritoneal membrane (PM) may degranulate to release preformed inflammatory mediators including histamine which is capable of diffusing into the surrounding interstitium, modulating cells in their vicinity including, human peritoneal mesothelial cells (hPMC). The present study aimed to investigate the quorum intracellular calcium ([Ca2+i]) response to histamine compared to the membrane soluble ionophore, A23187, in adherent cultured hPMC. To examine [Ca2+i] handling, Fura - 2 loaded cells were exposed to histamine and A23187. Agonist induced transient [Ca2+i] event(s) (TCE) were defined and compared including, resting calcium, peak height, recovery and transient kinetics. Changes in cell shape were examined with immunocytochemistry of the cortical actin (CA) and microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton. To investigate whether histamine induced changes in cell shape were mediated by [Ca2+i], mobilization of [Ca2+i] was prevented with 20 μmol/l of the calcium chelator 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM). Histamine produced a dose dependent increase of [Ca2+i], maximal at 1.0 mmol/l which recovered to the pre-challenge resting value. Transient multiplicity with repeated challenge was evident below a histamine threshold of 10−2 mmol/l. Morphometric analysis of MTs and CA showed significant cell elongation plus histamine and A23187. The histamine induced cell elongation was eliminated with [Ca2+i] clamping. This data indicated that increased [Ca2+i] was essential for cell elongation and the formation of stress fibres and therefore has a pivotal role in the regulation of the PM barrier.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple protein kinases regulate cell-cycle progression, of which the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are thought to act as upstream master regulators. We have used quantitative phosphoproteomics to analyze the fission yeast cell cycle at sufficiently high temporal resolution to distinguish fine-grain differences in substrate phosphorylation dynamics on a proteome-wide scale. This dataset provides a useful resource for investigating the regulatory dynamics of cell-cycle kinases and their substrates. For example, our analysis indicates that the substrates of different mitotic kinases (CDK, NIMA-related, Polo-like, and Aurora) are phosphorylated in sequential, kinase-specific waves during mitosis. Phosphoproteomics analysis after chemical-genetic manipulation of CDK activity suggests that the timing of these waves is established by the differential dependency of the downstream kinases on upstream CDK. We have also examined the temporal organization of phosphorylation during G1/S, as well as the coordination between the NDR-related kinase Orb6, which controls polarized growth, and other cell-cycle kinases.

Retinoic acid inhibits neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels,

Abstract: Retinoic acid is the active metabolite of vitamin A and regulates several important cellular processes by activating retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR). These receptors generally act as transcription factors, though non-genomic actions of both retinoic acid and the receptors have also been reported. One such nongenomic effect includes the modulation of Ca2+ levels during homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Retinoic acid can thus affect Ca2+ signaling and can potentially control both synaptic plasticity and neuronal firing. However, whether retinoic acid can regulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (either via genomic or nongenomic actions), which are fundamental to these processes, has not yet been studied in detail. Here we demonstrate the effects of retinoic acid on the biophysical properties of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in cultured invertebrate motorneurons. Overnight exposure to physiological concentrations of retinoic acid significantly inhibited the voltage-gated Ca2+ current (ICa) in an isomer-dependent manner. Specifically, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), but not 9-cis RA (9cRA), depolarized the voltage of half-maximal activation of ICa. AtRA also reduced the rate of channel activation and delayed recovery from inactivation. We provide evidence that both L-type and non-L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are affected by atRA, as both nifedipine-sensitive and nifedipine-resistant ICa were inhibited in these neurons. These effects of retinoic acid are thought to be at least partially mediated by the retinoid receptors, as treatment of the neurons with synthetic RAR and RXR agonists produced a similar inhibition of ICa.

Abstract: Summary
Stressful events rapidly trigger activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, driving the formation of aversive memories. However, it remains unclear how stressful experience affects plasticity mechanisms to regulate appetitive learning, such as intake of addictive drugs. Using rats, we show that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and α1 adrenergic receptor (α1AR) signaling enhance the plasticity of NMDA-receptor-mediated glutamatergic transmission in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons through distinct effects on inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)-dependent Ca2+ signaling. We find that CRF amplifies IP3-Ca2+ signaling induced by stimulation of α1ARs, revealing a cooperative mechanism that promotes glutamatergic plasticity. In line with this, acute social defeat stress engages similar cooperative CRF and α1AR signaling in the VTA to enhance learning of cocaine-paired cues. These data provide evidence that CRF and α1ARs act in concert to regulate IP3-Ca2+ signaling in the VTA and promote learning of drug-associated cues.

Abstract: Summary
Trinucleotide repeat expansions involving CTG/CAG triplets are responsible for several neurodegenerative disorders, including myotonic dystrophy and Huntington’s disease. Because expansions trigger the disease, contracting repeat length could be a possible approach to gene therapy for these disorders. Here, we show that a TALEN-induced double-strand break was very efficient at contracting expanded CTG repeats in yeast. We show that RAD51, POL32, and DNL4 are dispensable for double-strand break repair within CTG repeats, the only required genes being RAD50, SAE2, and RAD52. Resection was totally abolished in the absence of RAD50 on both sides of the break, whereas it was reduced in a sae2Δ mutant on the side of the break containing the longest repeat tract, suggesting that secondary structures at double-strand break ends must be removed by the Mre11-Rad50 complex and Sae2. Following the TALEN double-strand break, single-strand annealing occurred between both sides of the repeat tract, leading to repeat contraction.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria shape cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]c) transients and utilize the mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) in exchange for bioenergetics output. Conversely, dysregulated [Ca2+]c causes [Ca2+]m overload and induces permeability transition pore and cell death. Ablation of MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake exhibited elevated [Ca2+]c and failed to prevent stress-induced cell death. The mechanisms for these effects remain elusive. Here, we report that mitochondria undergo a cytosolic Ca2+-induced shape change that is distinct from mitochondrial fission and swelling. [Ca2+]c elevation, but not MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake, appears to be essential for the process we term mitochondrial shape transition (MiST). MiST is mediated by the mitochondrial protein Miro1 through its EF-hand domain 1 in multiple cell types. Moreover, Ca2+-dependent disruption of Miro1/KIF5B/tubulin complex is determined by Miro1 EF1 domain. Functionally, Miro1-dependent MiST is essential for autophagy/mitophagy that is attenuated in Miro1 EF1 mutants. Thus, Miro1 is a cytosolic Ca2+ sensor that decodes metazoan Ca2+ signals as MiST.

Abstract: Summary
The redox cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) plays a central role in metabolism and is a substrate for signaling enzymes including poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs) and sirtuins. NAD concentration falls during aging, which has triggered intense interest in strategies to boost NAD levels. A limitation in understanding NAD metabolism has been reliance on concentration measurements. Here, we present isotope-tracer methods for NAD flux quantitation. In cell lines, NAD was made from nicotinamide and consumed largely by PARPs and sirtuins. In vivo, NAD was made from tryptophan selectively in the liver, which then excreted nicotinamide. NAD fluxes varied widely across tissues, with high flux in the small intestine and spleen and low flux in the skeletal muscle. Intravenous administration of nicotinamide riboside or mononucleotide delivered intact molecules to multiple tissues, but the same agents given orally were metabolized to nicotinamide in the liver. Thus, flux analysis can reveal tissue-specific NAD metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
mRNA processing, transport, translation, and ultimately degradation involve a series of dedicated protein complexes that often assemble into large membraneless structures such as stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs). Here, systematic in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) analysis of 119 human proteins associated with different aspects of mRNA biology uncovers 7424 unique proximity interactions with 1,792 proteins. Classical bait-prey analysis reveals connections of hundreds of proteins to distinct mRNA-associated processes or complexes, including the splicing and transcriptional elongation machineries (protein phosphatase 4) and the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex (CEP85, RNF219, and KIAA0355). Analysis of correlated patterns between endogenous preys uncovers the spatial organization of RNA regulatory structures and enables the definition of 144 core components of SGs and PBs. We report preexisting contacts between most core SG proteins under normal growth conditions and demonstrate that several core SG proteins (UBAP2L, CSDE1, and PRRC2C) are critical for the formation of microscopically visible SGs.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages are a dominant leukocyte population in the tumor microenvironment and actively promote cancer progression. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the role of macrophages remains poorly understood. Here we show that polarized M2 macrophages enhance 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1)-mediated phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) threonine (T) 243 phosphorylation in tumor cells by secreting interleukin-6 (IL-6). This phosphorylation facilitates a PGK1-catalyzed reaction toward glycolysis by altering substrate affinity. Inhibition of PGK1 T243 phosphorylation or PDPK1 in tumor cells or neutralization of macrophage-derived IL-6 abrogates macrophage-promoted glycolysis, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. In addition, PGK1 T243 phosphorylation correlates with PDPK1 activation, IL-6 expression, and macrophage infiltration in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Moreover, PGK1 T243 phosphorylation also correlates with malignance and prognosis of human GBM. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of macrophage-promoted tumor growth by regulating tumor cell metabolism, implicating the therapeutic potential to disrupt the connection between macrophages and tumor cells by inhibiting PGK1 phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in KDM5 family histone demethylases cause intellectual disability in humans. However, the molecular mechanisms linking KDM5-regulated transcription and cognition remain unknown. Here, we establish Drosophila as a model to understand this connection by generating a fly strain harboring an allele analogous to a disease-causing missense mutation in human KDM5C (kdm5A512P). Transcriptome analysis of kdm5A512P flies revealed a striking downregulation of genes required for ribosomal assembly and function and a concomitant reduction in translation. kdm5A512P flies also showed impaired learning and/or memory. Significantly, the behavioral and transcriptional changes in kdm5A512P flies were similar to those specifically lacking demethylase activity. These data suggest that the primary defect of the KDM5A512P mutation is a loss of histone demethylase activity and reveal an unexpected role for this enzymatic function in gene activation. Because translation is critical for neuronal function, we propose that this defect contributes to the cognitive defects of kdm5A512P flies.

Abstract: Summary
Kes1/Osh4 is a member of the conserved, but functionally enigmatic, oxysterol binding protein-related protein (ORP) superfamily that inhibits phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (Sec14)-dependent membrane trafficking through the trans-Golgi (TGN)/endosomal network. We now report that Kes1, and select other ORPs, execute cell-cycle control activities as functionally non-redundant inhibitors of the G1/S transition when cells confront nutrient-poor environments and promote replicative aging. Kes1-dependent cell-cycle regulation requires the Greatwall/MASTL kinase ortholog Rim15, and is opposed by Sec14 activity in a mechanism independent of Kes1/Sec14 bulk membrane-trafficking functions. Moreover, the data identify Kes1 as a non-histone target for NuA4 through which this lysine acetyltransferase co-modulates membrane-trafficking and cell-cycle activities. We propose the Sec14/Kes1 lipid-exchange protein pair constitutes part of the mechanism for integrating TGN/endosomal lipid signaling with cell-cycle progression and hypothesize that ORPs define a family of stage-specific cell-cycle control factors that execute tumor-suppressor-like functions.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are effector lymphocytes with pivotal roles in the resistance against various tumors; dysfunction of NK cells often results in advanced tumor progression. Tumors develop in three stages comprising initiation, promotion, and progression, but little is known about the interrelationships between NK cells and tumor cells at different stages of tumor development. Here, we demonstrated that NK cells prevented tumor initiation potently but did not prevent tumor promotion or tumor progression in Kras-driven lung cancer. Moreover, loss of the antitumor effect in NK cells was closely associated with their dysfunctional state during tumor promotion and progression. Mechanistically, aberrant fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) expression in NK cells elicited their dysfunction by inhibiting glycolysis and impairing viability. Thus, our results show dynamic alterations of NK cells during tumor development and uncover a novel mechanism involved in NK cell dysfunction, suggesting potential directions for NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy involving FBP1 targeting.

Abstract: Chromatin remodeling factors are involved in many cellular processes such as transcription, replication, and DNA damage response by regulating chromatin structure. As one of chromatin remodeling factors, remodeling and spacing factor 1 (RSF1) is recruited at double strand break (DSB) sites and regulates ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) -dependent checkpoint pathway upon DNA damage for the efficient repair. RSF1 is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, but regulation of RSF1 levels remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that protein levels of RSF1 chromatin remodeler are temporally upregulated in response to different DNA damage agents without changing the RSF1 mRNA level. In the absence of SNF2h, a binding partner of RSF1, the RSF1 protein level was significantly diminished. Intriguingly, the level of RSF1-3SA mutant lacking ATM-mediated phosphorylation sites significantly increased, and upregulation of RSF1 levels under DNA damage was not observed in cells overexpressing ATM kinase. Furthermore, failure in the regulation of RSF1 level caused a significant reduction in DNA repair, whereas reconstitution of RSF1, but not of RSF1-3SA mutants, restored DSB repair. Our findings reveal that temporal regulation of RSF1 levels at its post-translational modification by SNF2h and ATM is essential for efficient DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
UV-B light (UV-B radiation) is known to inhibit plant growth, but the mechanism is not well understood. UVR8 (UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8) is a UV-B light photoreceptor that mediates UV-B light responses in plants. We report here that UV-B inhibits plant growth by repressing plant steroid hormone brassinosteroid (BR)-promoted plant growth. UVR8 physically interacts with the functional dephosphorylated BES1 (BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1) and BIM1 (BES1-INTERACTING MYC-LIKE 1) transcription factors that mediate BR-regulated gene expression and plant growth to inhibit their activities. Genome-wide gene expression analysis defined a BES1-dependent UV-B-regulated transcriptome, which is enriched with genes involved in cell elongation and plant growth. We further showed that UV-B-activated and nucleus-localized UVR8 inhibited the DNA-binding activities of BES1/BIM1 to directly regulate transcription of growth-related genes. Our results therefore establish that UVR8-BES1/BIM1 interaction represents an early photoreceptor signaling mechanism in plants and serves as an important module integrating light and BR signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Caloric restriction (CR) is standard lifestyle therapy in obesity management. CR-induced weight loss improves the metabolic profile of individuals with obesity. In mice, occurrence of beige fat cells in white fat depots favors a metabolically healthy phenotype, and CR promotes browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). Here, human subcutaneous abdominal WAT samples were analyzed in 289 individuals with obesity following a two-phase dietary intervention consisting of an 8 week very low calorie diet and a 6-month weight-maintenance phase. Before the intervention, we show sex differences and seasonal variation, with higher expression of brown and beige markers in women with obesity and during winter, respectively. The very low calorie diet resulted in decreased browning of subcutaneous abdominal WAT. During the whole dietary intervention, evolution of body fat and insulin resistance was independent of changes in brown and beige fat markers. These data suggest that diet-induced effects on body fat and insulin resistance are independent of subcutaneous abdominal WAT browning in people with obesity.

Abstract: In recent years, the interest towards the relationship between incretins and bone has been increasing. Previous studies have suggested that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its receptor agonists exert beneficial anabolic influence on skeletal metabolism, such as promoting proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts via entero-osseous-axis. However, little is known regarding the effects of GLP-1 on osteoblast apoptosis and the underlying mechanisms involved. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effects of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on apoptosis of murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. We confirmed the presence of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in MC3T3-E1 cells. Our data demonstrated that liraglutide inhibited the apoptosis of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells induced by serum deprivation, as detected by Annexin V/PI and Hoechst 33258 staining and ELISA assays. Moreover, liraglutide upregulated Bcl-2 expression and downregulated Bax expression and caspase-3 activity at intermediate concentration (100 nM) for maximum effect. Further study suggested that liraglutide stimulated the phosphorylation of AKT and enhanced cAMP level, along with decreased phosphorylation of GSK3β, increased β-catenin phosphorylation at Ser675 site and upregulated nuclear β-catenin content and transcriptional activity. Pretreatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, PKA inhibitor H89, and siRNAs GLP-1R, β-catenin abrogated the liraglutide-induced activation of cAMP, AKT, β-catenin, respectively. In conclusion, these findings illustrate that activation of GLP-1 receptor by liraglutide inhibits the apoptosis of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells induced by serum deprivation through cAMP/PKA/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Tight regulation of neuronal transport allows for cargo binding and release at specific cellular locations. The mechanisms by which motor proteins are loaded on vesicles and how cargoes are captured at appropriate sites remain unclear. To better understand how KIF1A-driven dense core vesicle (DCV) transport is regulated, we identified the KIF1A interactome and focused on three binding partners, the calcium binding protein calmodulin (CaM) and two synaptic scaffolding proteins: liprin-α and TANC2. We showed that calcium, acting via CaM, enhances KIF1A binding to DCVs and increases vesicle motility. In contrast, liprin-α and TANC2 are not part of the KIF1A-cargo complex but capture DCVs at dendritic spines. Furthermore, we found that specific TANC2 mutations—reported in patients with different neuropsychiatric disorders—abolish the interaction with KIF1A. We propose a model in which Ca2+/CaM regulates cargo binding and liprin-α and TANC2 recruit KIF1A-transported vesicles.

Abstract: Summary
The programmed formation of hundreds of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential for proper meiosis and fertility. In mice and humans, the location of these breaks is determined by the meiosis-specific protein PRDM9, through the DNA-binding specificity of its zinc-finger domain. PRDM9 also has methyltransferase activity. Here, we show that this activity is required for H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 deposition and for DSB formation at PRDM9-binding sites. By analyzing mice that express two PRDM9 variants with distinct DNA-binding specificities, we show that each variant generates its own set of H3K4me3 marks independently from the other variant. Altogether, we reveal several basic principles of PRDM9-dependent DSB site determination, in which an excess of sites are designated through PRDM9 binding and subsequent histone methylation, from which a subset is selected for DSB formation.

Abstract: Summary
Naive CD4+ T cells can be converted to Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) in the periphery (iTregs), where induction of Foxp3 gene expression is central to Treg differentiation. OX40 signaling is known to inhibit Foxp3 expression and Treg induction, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we found that OX40 costimulation activates two distinct molecular pathways to suppress Foxp3 expression in freshly activated naive CD4+ T cells. Specifically, OX40 upregulates BATF3 and BATF, which produce a closed chromatin configuration to repress Foxp3 expression in a Sirt1/7-dependent manner. Moreover, OX40 can also activate the AKT-mTOR pathway, especially in the absence of BATF3 and BATF, to inhibit Foxp3 induction, and this is mediated by phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the transcription factor Foxo1. Taken together, our results provide key mechanistic insights into how OX40 inhibits Foxp3 expression and Treg induction in the periphery.

Abstract: Arabinogalactan (AG) is an essential structural macromolecule present in the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, serving to connect peptidoglycan with the outer mycolic acid layer. The D-arabinan segment is a highly branched component of AG and is assembled in a step-wise fashion by a variety of arabinofuranosyltransferases (AraT). We have previously used Corynebacterium glutamicum as a model organism to study these complex processes which are otherwise essential in mycobacteria. In order to further our understanding of the molecular basis of AG assembly, we investigated the role of a fourth AraT, now termed AftD by generating single (ΔaftD) and double deletion (ΔaftB ΔaftD) mutants of C. glutamicum. We demonstrate that AftD functions as an α(1 → 5) AraT and reveal the point at which it exerts its activity in the AG biosynthetic pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Selenof (15-kDa selenoprotein; Sep15) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident thioredoxin-like oxidoreductase that occurs in a complex with UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. We found that Selenof deficiency in mice leads to elevated levels of non-functional circulating plasma immunoglobulins and increased secretion of IgM during in vitro splenic B cell differentiation. However, Selenof knockout animals show neither enhanced bacterial killing capacity nor antigen-induced systemic IgM activity, suggesting that excess immunoglobulins are not functional. In addition, ER-to-Golgi transport of a target glycoprotein was delayed in Selenof knockout embryonic fibroblasts, and proteomic analyses revealed that Selenof deficiency is primarily associated with antigen presentation and ER-to-Golgi transport. Together, the data suggest that Selenof functions as a gatekeeper of immunoglobulins and, likely, other client proteins that exit the ER, thereby supporting redox quality control of these proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Hemophilia B is an ideal target for gene- and cell-based therapies because of its monogenic nature and broad therapeutic index. Here, we demonstrate the use of cell therapy as a potential long-term cure for hemophilia B in our FIX-deficient mouse model. We show that transplanted, cryopreserved, cadaveric human hepatocytes remain functional for more than a year and secrete FIX at therapeutic levels. Hepatocytes from different sources (companies and donors) perform comparably in curing the bleeding defect. We also generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two hemophilia B patients and corrected the disease-causing mutations in them by two different approaches (mutation specific and universal). These corrected iPSCs were differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) and transplanted into hemophilic mice. We demonstrate these iPSC-HLCs to be viable and functional in mouse models for 9–12 months. This study aims to establish the use of cells from autologous and heterologous sources to treat hemophilia B.

Abstract: Summary
T cells compete with malignant cells for limited nutrients within the solid tumor microenvironment. We found that effector memory CD4 T cells respond distinctly from other T cell subsets to limiting glucose and can maintain high levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production in a nutrient-poor environment. Unlike naive (TN) or central memory T (TCM) cells, effector memory T (TEM) cells fail to upregulate fatty acid synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and reductive glutaminolysis in limiting glucose. Interference of fatty acid synthesis in naive T cells dramatically upregulates IFN-γ, while increasing exogenous lipids in media inhibits production of IFN-γ by all subsets, suggesting that relative ratio of fatty acid metabolism to glycolysis is a direct predictor of T cell effector activity. Together, these data suggest that effector memory T cells are programmed to have limited ability to synthesize and metabolize fatty acids, which allows them to maintain T cell function in nutrient-depleted microenvironments.

Abstract: Crosstalk between G-protein signaling and glutamatergic transmission within the brain reward circuits is critical for long-term emotional effects (depression and anxiety), cravings, and negative withdrawal symptoms associated with opioid addiction. A previous study showed that Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) may be implicated in opiate action in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the mechanism of the NAc-specific RGS4 actions that induce the behavioral responses to opiates remains largely unknown. The present study used a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knock-down of RGS4 in the NAc of the mouse brain to investigate the relationship between the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors and RGS4 in the NAc during morphine reward. Additionally, the shRNA-mediated RGS4 knock-down was implemented in NAc/striatal primary-cultured neurons to investigate the role that striatal neurons have in the morphine-induced activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The results of this study show that the NAc-specific knockdown of RGS4 significantly increased the behaviors associated with morphine and did so by phosphorylation of the GluR1 (Ser831) and NR2A (Tyr1325) glutamate receptors in the NAc. Furthermore, the knock-down of RGS4 enhanced the phosphorylation of the GluR1 and NR2A glutamate receptors in the primary NAc/striatal neurons during spontaneous morphine withdrawal. These findings show a novel molecular mechanism of RGS4 in glutamatergic transmission that underlies the negative symptoms associated with morphine administration.

Abstract: Summary
S-nitrosation, commonly referred to as S-nitrosylation, is widely regarded as a ubiquitous, stable post-translational modification that directly regulates many proteins. Such a widespread role would appear to be incompatible with the inherent lability of the S-nitroso bond, especially its propensity to rapidly react with thiols to generate disulfide bonds. As anticipated, we observed robust and widespread protein S-nitrosation after exposing cells to nitrosocysteine or lipopolysaccharide. Proteins detected using the ascorbate-dependent biotin switch method are typically interpreted to be directly regulated by S-nitrosation. However, these S-nitrosated proteins are shown to predominantly comprise transient intermediates leading to disulfide bond formation. These disulfides are likely to be the dominant end effectors resulting from elevations in nitrosating cellular nitric oxide species. We propose that S-nitrosation primarily serves as a transient intermediate leading to disulfide formation. Overall, we conclude that the current widely held perception that stable S-nitrosation directly regulates the function of many proteins is significantly incorrect.

Abstract: Summary
Highly effective HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies could have utility in the prevention or treatment of HIV-1 infection. To improve the potency of 10E8, an antibody capable of near pan-HIV-1 neutralization, we engineered 10E8-surface mutants and screened for improved neutralization. Variants with the largest functional enhancements involved the addition of hydrophobic or positively charged residues, which were positioned to interact with viral membrane lipids or viral glycan-sialic acids, respectively. In both cases, the site of improvement was spatially separated from the region of antibody mediating molecular contact with the protein component of the antigen, thereby improving peripheral semi-specific interactions while maintaining unmodified dominant contacts responsible for broad recognition. The optimized 10E8 antibody, with mutations to phenylalanine and arginine, retained the extraordinary breadth of 10E8 but with ∼10-fold increased potency. We propose surface-matrix screening as a general method to improve antibodies, with improved semi-specific interactions between antibody and antigen enabling increased potency without compromising breadth.

Abstract: Summary
Proper morphogenesis of dendrites plays a fundamental role in the establishment of neural circuits. The molecular mechanism by which dendrites grow highly complex branches is not well understood. Here, using the Caenorhabditis elegans PVD neuron, we demonstrate that high-order dendritic branching requires actin polymerization driven by coordinated interactions between two membrane proteins, DMA-1 and HPO-30, with their cytoplasmic interactors, the RacGEF TIAM-1 and the actin nucleation promotion factor WAVE regulatory complex (WRC). The dendrite branching receptor DMA-1 directly binds to the PDZ domain of TIAM-1, while the claudin-like protein HPO-30 directly interacts with the WRC. On dendrites, DMA-1 and HPO-30 form a receptor-associated signaling complex to bring TIAM-1 and the WRC to close proximity, leading to elevated assembly of F-actin needed to drive high-order dendrite branching. The synergistic activation of F-actin assembly by scaffolding distinct actin regulators might represent a general mechanism in promoting complex dendrite arborization.

Abstract: Live yeast cell derivative (LYCD) is a medicinal yeast extract that has been used in the treatment of burns, wounds and hemorrhoids for over 70 years. It has been shown to enhance the closure of skin wounds in diabetic mice by increasing inflammation, angiogenesis, formation of granulation tissue and epithelial migration. An active fraction of LYCD has been identified as a mixture of peptides ranging in size from 5 kDA to 17 kDA. Despite its widespread use over many years, understanding of the mechanism by which LYCD acts to effect tissue repair responses is very limited. In this study, we have used a human monocyte-derived cell line, THP-1, as a representative of the inflammatory component of the wound healing process. We have identified two of the earliest responses to LYCD as an increase in cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) and the transcripts for c-fos. We have found that the increase in [Ca2+]i is both necessary and sufficient to account for the LYCD-induced elevation of c-fos. Furthermore, we have shown that the signaling pathway by which LYCD elevates [Ca2+]i involves both mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium. Mobilization of store Ca2+ occurs first via activation of phospholipase C and this is followed by influx through activation of store operated calcium channels. These results constitute the first delineation of the early steps of the LYCD signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in several general pre-mRNA splicing factors have been linked to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and solid tumors. These mutations have generally been assumed to cause disease by the resultant splicing defects, but different mutations appear to induce distinct splicing defects, raising the possibility that an alternative common mechanism is involved. Here we report a chain of events triggered by multiple splicing factor mutations, especially high-risk alleles in SRSF2 and U2AF1, including elevated R-loops, replication stress, and activation of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)-Chk1 pathway. We further demonstrate that enhanced R-loops, opposite to the expectation from gained RNA binding with mutant SRSF2, result from impaired transcription pause release because the mutant protein loses its ability to extract the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD) kinase—the positive transcription elongation factor complex (P-TEFb)—from the 7SK complex. Enhanced R-loops are linked to compromised proliferation of bone-marrow-derived blood progenitors, which can be partially rescued by RNase H overexpression, suggesting a direct contribution of augmented R-loops to the MDS phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
During development, progenitors progress through transition states. The cardiac epicardium contains progenitors of essential non-cardiomyocytes. The Hippo pathway, a kinase cascade that inhibits the Yap transcriptional co-factor, controls organ size in developing hearts. Here, we investigated Hippo kinases Lats1 and Lats2 in epicardial diversification. Epicardial-specific deletion of Lats1/2 was embryonic lethal, and mutant embryos had defective coronary vasculature remodeling. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that Lats1/2 mutant cells failed to activate fibroblast differentiation but remained in an intermediate cell state with both epicardial and fibroblast characteristics. Lats1/2 mutant cells displayed an arrested developmental trajectory with persistence of epicardial markers and expanded expression of Yap targets Dhrs3, an inhibitor of retinoic acid synthesis, and Dpp4, a protease that modulates extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. Genetic and pharmacologic manipulation revealed that Yap inhibits fibroblast differentiation, prolonging a subepicardial-like cell state, and promotes expression of matricellular factors, such as Dpp4, that define ECM characteristics.

Abstract: Summary
Mitotic segregation of chromosomes requires precise coordination of many factors, yet evidence is lacking as to how genes encoding these elements are transcriptionally controlled. Here, we found that the Pygopus (Pygo)2 chromatin effector is indispensable for expression of the MYC-dependent genes that regulate cancer cell division. Depletion of Pygo2 arrested SKOV-3 cells at metaphase, which resulted from the failure of chromosomes to capture spindle microtubules, a critical step for chromosomal biorientation and segregation. This observation was consistent with global chromatin association findings in HeLa S3 cells, revealing the enrichment of Pygo2 and MYC at promoters of biorientation and segmentation genes, at which Pygo2 maintained histone H3K27 acetylation. Immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays demonstrated MYC and Pygo2 interacting in nuclei, corroborated in a heterologous MYC-driven prostate cancer model that was distinct from Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our evidence supports a role for Pygo2 as an essential component of MYC oncogenic activity required for mitosis.

Abstract: Summary
Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) has multiple roles in orchestrating whole-body energy homeostasis. In addition, VAT is now considered an immune site harboring an array of innate and adaptive immune cells with a direct role in immune surveillance and host defense. We report that conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) in VAT acquire a tolerogenic phenotype through upregulation of pathways involved in adipocyte differentiation. While activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in cDC1 DCs induces IL-10 production, upregulation of the PPARγ pathway in cDC2 DCs directly suppresses their activation. Combined, they promote an anti-inflammatory milieu in vivo delaying the onset of obesity-induced chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. Under long-term over-nutrition, changes in adipocyte biology curtail β-catenin and PPARγ activation, contributing to VAT inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, necessitating further improvements in diagnosis and therapy. Targeted therapies directed against chromatin regulators are emerging as promising approaches in preclinical studies and early clinical trials. Here, we demonstrate an oncogenic role for the protein lysine methyltransferase SETDB2 in leukemia pathogenesis. It is overexpressed in pre-BCR+ ALL and required for their maintenance in vitro and in vivo. SETDB2 expression is maintained as a direct target gene of the chimeric transcription factor E2A-PBX1 in a subset of ALL and suppresses expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor CDKN2C through histone H3K9 tri-methylation, thus establishing an oncogenic pathway subordinate to E2A-PBX1 that silences a major tumor suppressor in ALL. In contrast, SETDB2 was relatively dispensable for normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation. SETDB2 knockdown enhances sensitivity to kinase and chromatin inhibitors, providing a mechanistic rationale for targeting SETDB2 therapeutically in ALL.

Abstract: Summary
T cells are strongly regulated by oxidizing environments and amino acid restriction. How T cells reprogram metabolism to adapt to these extracellular stress situations is not well understood. Here, we show that oxidizing environments and amino acid starvation induce ATF4 in CD4+ T cells. We also demonstrate that Atf4-deficient CD4+ T cells have defects in redox homeostasis, proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine production. We further reveal that ATF4 regulates a coordinated gene network that drives amino acid intake, mTORC1 activation, protein translation, and an anabolic program for de novo synthesis of amino acids and glutathione. ATF4 also promotes catabolic glycolysis and glutaminolysis and oxidative phosphorylation and thereby provides precursors and energy for anabolic pathways. ATF4-deficient mice mount reduced Th1 but elevated Th17 immune responses and develop more severe experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our study demonstrates that ATF4 is critical for CD4+ T cell-mediated immune responses through driving metabolic adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) is a main cytoskeletal regulator in B cells. WASp-interacting protein (WIP) binds to and stabilizes WASp but also interacts with actin. Using mice with a mutated actin binding domain of WIP (WIPΔABD), we here investigated the role of WIP binding to actin during B cell activation. We found an altered differentiation of WIPΔABD B cells and diminished antibody affinity maturation after immunization. Mechanistically, WIPΔABD B cells showed impaired B cell receptor (BCR)-induced PI3K signaling and actin reorganization, likely caused by diminished CD81 expression and altered CD19 dynamics on the B cell surface. WIPΔABD B cells displayed reduced in vivo motility, concomitantly with impaired chemotaxis and defective F-actin polarization, HS1 phosphorylation, and polarization of HS1 to F-actin-rich structures after CXCL12 stimulation in vitro. We thus concluded that WIP binding to actin, independent of its binding to WASp, is critical for actin cytoskeleton plasticity in B cells.

Abstract: Summary
Uveal melanoma (UM) is characterized by mutually exclusive activating mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, CYSLTR2, and PLCB4, four genes in a linear pathway to activation of PLCβ in almost all tumors and loss of BAP1 in the aggressive subset. We generated mice with melanocyte-specific expression of GNA11Q209L with and without homozygous Bap1 loss. The GNA11Q209L mice recapitulated human Gq-associated melanomas, and they developed pigmented neoplastic lesions from melanocytes of the skin and non-cutaneous organs, including the eye and leptomeninges, as well as at atypical sites, including the lymph nodes and lungs. The addition of Bap1 loss increased tumor proliferation and cutaneous melanoma size. Integrative transcriptome analysis of human and murine melanomas identified RasGRP3 to be specifically expressed in GNAQ/GNA11-driven melanomas. In human UM cell lines and murine models, RasGRP3 is specifically required for GNAQ/GNA11-driven Ras activation and tumorigenesis. This implicates RasGRP3 as a critical node and a potential target in UM.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical properties are cues for many biological processes in health or disease. In the heart, changes to the extracellular matrix composition and cross-linking result in stiffening of the cellular microenvironment during development. Moreover, myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies lead to fibrosis and a stiffer environment, affecting cardiomyocyte behavior. Here, we identify that single cardiomyocyte adhesions sense simultaneous (fast oscillating) cardiac and (slow) non-muscle myosin contractions. Together, these lead to oscillating tension on the mechanosensitive adaptor protein talin on substrates with a stiffness of healthy adult heart tissue, compared with no tension on embryonic heart stiffness and continuous stretching on fibrotic stiffness. Moreover, we show that activation of PKC leads to the induction of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in a stiffness-dependent way, through activation of non-muscle myosin. Finally, PKC and non-muscle myosin are upregulated at the costameres in heart disease, indicating aberrant mechanosensing as a contributing factor to long-term remodeling and heart failure.

Abstract: Karyopherin β1 (Kpnβ1), also known as importin-β, is part of the karyopherin superfamily of nuclear transport proteins. Kpnβ1 is an oncogene that is overexpressed in various human cancers. Recent studies have showed that Kpnβ1 is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the world. However, the role of Kpnβ1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains uncertain. In this study, we used western blotting to show that Kpnβ1 expression is higher in lung-cancer tissues and cells, and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that Kpnβ1 was significantly associated with the clinicopathological features of NSCLC. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that elevated Kpnβ1 expression correlated with a poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. Serum starvation-refeeding experiments and Kpnβ1-shRNA transfection assays revealed that elevated Kpnβ1 expression promoted cell proliferation and reduced sensitivity to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that Kpnβ1 interacts with PI3 K to activate the PI3-kinase/AKT pathway, leading to enhanced cell survival and drug resistance in NSCLC cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that Kpnβ1 plays a significant role in NSCLC progression and chemoresistance. Our study provides new insights for targeted therapy to treat NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Development of resistance causes failure of drugs targeting receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) networks and represents a critical challenge for precision medicine. Here, we show that PHLDA1 downregulation is critical to acquisition and maintenance of drug resistance in RTK-driven cancer. Using fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibition in endometrial cancer cells, we identify an Akt-driven compensatory mechanism underpinned by downregulation of PHLDA1. We demonstrate broad clinical relevance of our findings, showing that PHLDA1 downregulation also occurs in response to RTK-targeted therapy in breast and renal cancer patients, as well as following trastuzumab treatment in HER2+ breast cancer cells. Crucially, knockdown of PHLDA1 alone was sufficient to confer de novo resistance to RTK inhibitors and induction of PHLDA1 expression re-sensitized drug-resistant cancer cells to targeted therapies, identifying PHLDA1 as a biomarker for drug response and highlighting the potential of PHLDA1 reactivation as a means of circumventing drug resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The patterning of tissues to form subdivisions with distinct and homogeneous regional identity is potentially disrupted by cell intermingling. Transplantation studies suggest that homogeneous segmental identity in the hindbrain is maintained by identity switching of cells that intermingle into another segment. We show that switching occurs during normal development and is mediated by feedback between segment identity and the retinoic acid degrading enzymes, cyp26b1 and cyp26c1. egr2, which specifies the segmental identity of rhombomeres r3 and r5, underlies the lower expression level of cyp26b1 and cyp26c1 in r3 and r5 compared with r2, r4, and r6. Consequently, r3 or r5 cells that intermingle into adjacent segments encounter cells with higher cyp26b1/c1 expression, which we find is required for downregulation of egr2b expression. Furthermore, egr2b expression is regulated in r2, r4, and r6 by non-autonomous mechanisms that depend upon the number of neighbors that express egr2b. These findings reveal that a community regulation of retinoid signaling maintains homogeneous segmental identity.

This animal model was useful to give an insight of the functional pattern involved in pigmentation, cryptism and photosensitivity. Skin from back and flanks, in electron microscopy, shows a high concentration of chromatophores, among those melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores have been reported. Interestingly, in the flank-back transition region electron microscopy reveals the presence of nerve endings. Our contribution adds new knowledge about the skin of this species, and it could be useful to study in deep the mechanism of cryptic colour change in reptiles.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence indicates that the MDM2 oncoprotein promotes tumorigenesis beyond its canonical negative effects on the p53 tumor suppressor, but these p53-independent functions remain poorly understood. Here, we show that a fraction of endogenous MDM2 is actively imported in mitochondria to control respiration and mitochondrial dynamics independently of p53. Mitochondrial MDM2 represses the transcription of NADH-dehydrogenase 6 (MT-ND6) in vitro and in vivo, impinging on respiratory complex I activity and enhancing mitochondrial ROS production. Recruitment of MDM2 to mitochondria increases during oxidative stress and hypoxia. Accordingly, mice lacking MDM2 in skeletal muscles exhibit higher MT-ND6 levels, enhanced complex I activity, and increased muscular endurance in mild hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, increased mitochondrial MDM2 levels enhance the migratory and invasive properties of cancer cells. Collectively, these data uncover a previously unsuspected function of the MDM2 oncoprotein in mitochondria that play critical roles in skeletal muscle physiology and may contribute to tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer chronotherapy, treatment at specific times during circadian rhythms, endeavors to optimize anti-tumor effects and to lower toxicity. However, comprehensive characterization of clock genes and their clinical relevance in cancer is lacking. We systematically characterized the alterations of clock genes across 32 cancer types by analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal, and The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer databases. Expression alterations of clock genes are associated with key oncogenic pathways, patient survival, tumor stage, and subtype in multiple cancer types. Correlations between expression of clock genes and of other genes in the genome were altered in cancerous versus normal tissues. We identified interactions between clock genes and clinically actionable genes by analyzing co-expression, protein-protein interaction, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data and also found that clock gene expression is correlated to anti-cancer drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the circadian clock across different cancer types and highlights potential clinical utility of cancer chronotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Inter-tissue communication via secreted proteins has been established as a vital mechanism for proper physiologic homeostasis. Here, we report a bioinformatics framework using a mouse reference population, the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), which integrates global multi-tissue expression data and publicly available resources to identify and functionally annotate novel circuits of tissue-tissue communication. We validate this method by showing that we can identify known as well as novel endocrine factors responsible for communication between tissues. We further show the utility of this approach by identification and mechanistic characterization of two new endocrine factors. Adipose-derived Lipocalin-5 is shown to enhance skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, and liver-secreted Notum promotes browning of white adipose tissue, also known as “beiging.” We demonstrate the general applicability of the method by providing in vivo evidence for three additional novel molecules mediating tissue-tissue interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitination is a major mechanism that regulates numerous cellular processes, including autophagy, DNA damage signaling, and inflammation. While hundreds of ubiquitin ligases exist to conjugate ubiquitin onto substrates, approximately 100 deubiquitinases are encoded by the human genome. Thus, deubiquitinases are likely regulated by unidentified mechanisms to target distinct substrates and cellular functions. Here, we demonstrate that the deubiquitinase OTUD4, which nominally encodes a K48-specific deubiquitinase, is phosphorylated near its catalytic domain, activating a latent K63-specific deubiquitinase. Besides phosphorylation, this latter activity requires an adjacent ubiquitin-interacting motif, which increases the affinity of OTUD4 for K63-linked chains. We reveal the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-associated factor MyD88 as a target of this K63 deubiquitinase activity. Consequently, TLR-mediated activation of NF-κB is negatively regulated by OTUD4, and macrophages from Otud4−/− mice exhibit increased inflammatory signaling upon TLR stimulation. Our results reveal insights into how a deubiquitinase may modulate diverse processes through post-translational modification.

Abstract: Summary
Sterile inflammation after tissue damage is a ubiquitous response, yet it has the highest amplitude in the liver. This has major clinical consequences, for alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH and NASH) account for the majority of liver disease in industrialized countries and both lack therapy. Requirements for sustained sterile inflammation include increased oxidative stress and activation of the HIF-1α signaling pathway. We demonstrate the ability of digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, to protect from liver inflammation and damage in ASH and NASH. Digoxin was effective in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and suppressing HIF-1α pathway activation. A proteomic screen revealed that digoxin binds pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), and independently of PKM2 kinase activity results in chromatin remodeling and downregulation of HIF-1α transactivation. These data identify PKM2 as a mediator and therapeutic target for regulating liver sterile inflammation, and demonstrate a novel role for digoxin that can effectively protect the liver from ASH and NASH.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are considered a heterogeneous cell population. To further resolve the HSC compartment, we characterized a retinoic acid (RA) reporter mouse line. Sub-fractionation of the HSC compartment in RA-CFP reporter mice demonstrated that RA-CFP-dim HSCs were largely non-proliferative and displayed superior engraftment potential in comparison with RA-CFP-bright HSCs. Gene expression analysis demonstrated higher expression of RA-target genes in RA-CFP-dim HSCs, in contrast to the RA-CFP reporter expression, but both RA-CFP-dim and RA-CFP-bright HSCs responded efficiently to RA in vitro. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of >1,200 HSCs showed that differences in cell cycle activity constituted the main driver of transcriptional heterogeneity in HSCs. Moreover, further analysis of the single-cell RNA-seq data revealed that stochastic low-level expression of distinct lineage-affiliated transcriptional programs is a common feature of HSCs. Collectively, this work demonstrates the utility of the RA-CFP reporter line as a tool for the isolation of superior HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Type 1 interferon (T1IFN) signaling promotes inflammation and lupus pathology, but its role in autoreactive B cell development in the antibody-forming cell (AFC) and germinal center (GC) pathways is unclear. Using a lupus model that allows for focused study of the AFC and GC responses, we show that T1IFN signaling is crucial for autoreactive B cell development in the AFC and GC pathways. Through bone marrow chimeras, DNA-reactive B cell transfer, and GC-specific Cre mice, we confirm that IFNαR signaling in B cells promotes autoreactive B cell development into both pathways. Transcriptomic analysis reveals gene expression alterations in multiple signaling pathways in non-GC and GC B cells in the absence of IFNαR. Finally, we find that T1IFN signaling promotes autoreactive B cell development in the AFC and GC pathways by regulating BCR signaling. These data suggest value for anti-IFNαR therapy in individuals with elevated T1IFN activity before clinical disease onset.

Abstract: Summary
Adipocytes play important roles in regulating cardiovascular health and disease. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the endocrine role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in pathological cardiac remodeling remains unknown. Herein we show that adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) knockout (A2ARKO) causes interscapular BAT (iBAT) dysfunction, leading to accelerated cardiac remodeling in hypertension compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Surgical iBAT depletion induces dramatic cardiac remodeling in WT but not in A2ARKO hypertensive mice. AMPK/PGC1α signaling-induced fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in brown adipocytes is required for A2AR-mediated inhibition of hypertensive cardiac remodeling. Recombinant FGF21 administration improves cardiac remodeling in iBAT-depleted hypertensive mice. More importantly, brown adipocyte-specific A2ARKO inhibits FGF21 production and accelerates cardiac damage in hypertension. Consistently, brown adipocyte-specific FGF21 knockout abolishes the effects of A2AR agonism in attenuating hypertensive cardiac remodeling. Our findings reveal a distinctive endocrine role of BAT in hypertensive cardiac remodeling via activating A2AR/FGF21 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Prokaryotic Argonaute (Ago) proteins were recently shown to target foreign genetic elements, thus making them a perfect model for studies of interference mechanisms. Here, we study interactions of Rhodobacter sphaeroides Ago (RsAgo) with guide RNA (gRNA) and fully complementary or imperfect target DNA (tDNA) using biochemical and structural approaches. We show that RsAgo can specifically recognize both the first nucleotide in gRNA and complementary nucleotide in tDNA, and both interactions contribute to nucleic acid binding. Non-canonical pairs and bulges on the target strand can be accommodated by RsAgo with minimal perturbation of the duplex but significantly reduce RsAgo affinity to tDNA. Surprisingly, mismatches between gRNA and tDNA induce dissociation of the guide-target duplex from RsAgo. Our results reveal plasticity in the ability of Ago proteins to accommodate helical imperfections, show how this might affect the efficiency of RNA silencing, and suggest a potential mechanism for guide release and Ago recycling.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical severity of Staphylococcus aureus respiratory infection correlates with alpha toxin (AT) expression. AT activates the NLRP3 inflammasome; deletion of Nlrp3, or AT neutralization, protects mice from lethal S. aureus pneumonia. We tested the hypothesis that this protection is not due to a reduction in inflammasome-dependent cytokines (IL-1β/IL-18) but increased bactericidal function of macrophages. In vivo, neutralization of AT or NLRP3 improved bacterial clearance and survival, while blocking IL-1β/IL-18 did not. Primary human monocytes were used in vitro to determine the mechanism through which NLRP3 alters bacterial killing. In cells treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting NLRP3 or infected with AT-null S. aureus, mitochondria co-localize with bacterial-containing phagosomes. Mitochondrial engagement activates caspase-1, a process dependent on complex II of the electron transport chain, near the phagosome, promoting its acidification. These data demonstrate a mechanism utilized by S. aureus to sequester itself from antimicrobial processes within the cell.

Abstract: Summary
Gliomas comprise heterogeneous malignant glial and stromal cells. While blood vessel co-option is a potential mechanism to escape anti-angiogenic therapy, the relevance of glial phenotype in this process is unclear. We show that Olig2+ oligodendrocyte precursor-like glioma cells invade by single-cell vessel co-option and preserve the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Conversely, Olig2-negative glioma cells form dense perivascular collections and promote angiogenesis and BBB breakdown, leading to innate immune cell activation. Experimentally, Olig2 promotes Wnt7b expression, a finding that correlates in human glioma profiling. Targeted Wnt7a/7b deletion or pharmacologic Wnt inhibition blocks Olig2+ glioma single-cell vessel co-option and enhances responses to temozolomide. Finally, Olig2 and Wnt7 become upregulated after anti-VEGF treatment in preclinical models and patients. Thus, glial-encoded pathways regulate distinct glioma-vascular microenvironmental interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Telomeres regulate DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair activity at chromosome ends. How telomere macromolecular structure contributes to ATM regulation and its potential dissociation from control over non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-dependent telomere fusion is of central importance to telomere-dependent cell aging and tumor suppression. Using super-resolution microscopy, we identify that ATM activation at mammalian telomeres with reduced TRF2 or at human telomeres during mitotic arrest occurs specifically with a structural change from telomere loops (t-loops) to linearized telomeres. Additionally, we find the TRFH domain of TRF2 regulates t-loop formation while suppressing ATM activity. Notably, we demonstrate that ATM activation and telomere linearity occur separately from telomere fusion via NHEJ and that linear DDR-positive telomeres can remain resistant to fusion, even during an extended G1 arrest, when NHEJ is most active. Collectively, these results suggest t-loops act as conformational switches that specifically regulate ATM activation independent of telomere mechanisms to inhibit NHEJ.

Abstract: Summary
Sequence-specific pausing by RNA polymerase (RNAP) during transcription plays crucial and diverse roles in gene expression. In bacteria, RNA structures are thought to fold within the RNA exit channel of the RNAP and can increase pause lifetimes significantly. The biophysical mechanism of pausing is uncertain. We used single-particle cryo-EM to determine structures of paused complexes, including a 3.8-Å structure of an RNA hairpin-stabilized, paused RNAP that coordinates RNA folding in the his operon attenuation control region of E. coli. The structures revealed a half-translocated pause state (RNA post-translocated, DNA pre-translocated) that can explain transcriptional pausing and a global conformational change of RNAP that allosterically inhibits trigger loop folding and can explain pause hairpin action. Pause hairpin interactions with the RNAP RNA exit channel suggest how RNAP guides the formation of nascent RNA structures.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNA-mediated gene silencing is a fundamental mechanism in the regulation of gene expression. It remains unclear how the efficiency of RNA silencing could be influenced by RNA-binding proteins associated with the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Here we report that fused in sarcoma (FUS), an RNA-binding protein linked to neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), interacts with the core miRISC component AGO2 and is required for optimal microRNA-mediated gene silencing. FUS promotes gene silencing by binding to microRNA and mRNA targets, as illustrated by its action on miR-200c and its target ZEB1. A truncated mutant form of FUS that leads its carriers to an aggressive form of ALS, R495X, impairs microRNA-mediated gene silencing. The C. elegans homolog fust-1 also shares a conserved role in regulating the microRNA pathway. Collectively, our results suggest a role for FUS in regulating the activity of microRNA-mediated silencing.

Abstract: Summary
Recent integrative epigenome analyses highlight the importance of functionally distinct chromatin states for accurate cell function. How these states are established and maintained is a matter of intense investigation. Here, we present evidence for DNA damage as an unexpected means to shape a protective chromatin environment at regions of recurrent replication stress (RS). Upon aberrant fork stalling, DNA damage signaling and concomitant H2AX phosphorylation coordinate the FACT-dependent deposition of macroH2A1.2, a histone variant that promotes DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). MacroH2A1.2, in turn, facilitates the accumulation of the tumor suppressor and HR effector BRCA1 at replication forks to protect from RS-induced DNA damage. Consequently, replicating primary cells steadily accrue macroH2A1.2 at fragile regions, whereas macroH2A1.2 loss in these cells triggers DNA damage signaling-dependent senescence, a hallmark of RS. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that recurrent DNA damage contributes to the chromatin landscape to ensure the epigenomic integrity of dividing cells.

Abstract: Summary
Non-retroviral integrated RNA viral sequences (NIRVs) potentially encoding ∼280 amino acid homologs to filovirus VP35 proteins are present across the Myotis genus of bats. These are estimated to have been maintained for ∼18 million years, indicating their co-option. To address the reasons for co-option, 16 Myotis VP35s were characterized in comparison to VP35s from the extant filoviruses Ebola virus and Marburg virus, in which VP35s play critical roles in immune evasion and RNA synthesis. The Myotis VP35s demonstrated a conserved suppression of innate immune signaling, albeit with reduced potency, in either human or Myotis cells. Their attenuation reflects a lack of dsRNA binding that in the filoviral VP35s correlates with potent suppression of interferon responses. Despite divergent function, evolution has preserved in Myotis the structure of the filoviral VP35s, indicating that this structure is critical for co-opted function, possibly as a regulator of innate immune signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular signaling networks coordinate physiological processes in all multicellular organisms. Within networks, modules switch their function to control signaling activity in response to the cellular context. However, systematic approaches to map the interplay of such modules have been lacking. Here, we generated a context-dependent genetic interaction network of a metazoan's signaling pathway. Using Wnt signaling in Drosophila as a model, we measured >290,000 double perturbations of the pathway in a baseline state, after activation by Wnt ligand or after loss of the tumor suppressor APC. We found that genetic interactions within the Wnt network globally rewired after pathway activation. We derived between-state networks that showed how genes changed their function between state-specific networks. This related pathway inhibitors across states and identified genes required for pathway activation. For instance, we predicted and confirmed the ER-resident protein Catsup to be required for ligand-mediated Wnt signaling activation. Together, state-dependent and between-state genetic interaction networks identify responsive functional modules that control cellular pathways.

Abstract: The main characteristic of biofilm formation is extracellular matrix (ECM) production. The cells within the biofilm are surrounded by ECM which provides structural integrity and protection. During an infection, this protection is mainly against cells of the immune system and antifungal drugs. A. fumigatus forms biofilms during static growth on a solid substratum and in chronic aspergillosis infections. It is important to understand how, and which, A. fumigatus signal transduction pathways are important for the adhesion and biofilm formation in a host during infection. Here we investigated the role of MAP kinases and protein phosphatases in biofilm formation. The loss of the MAP kinases MpkA, MpkC and SakA had an impact on the cell surface and the ECM during biofilm formation and reduced the adherence of A. fumigatus to polystyrene and fibronectin-coated plates. The phosphatase null mutants ΔsitA and ΔptcB, involved in regulation of MpkA and SakA phosphorylation, influenced cell wall carbohydrate exposure. Moreover, we characterized the A. fumigatus protein phosphatase PphA. The ΔpphA strain was more sensitive to cell wall-damaging agents, had increased β-(1,3)-glucan and reduced chitin, decreased conidia phagocytosis by Dictyostelium discoideum and reduced adhesion and biofilm formation. Finally, ΔpphA strain was avirulent in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and increased the released of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) from bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs). These results show that MAP kinases and phosphatases play an important role in signaling pathways that regulate the composition of the cell wall, extracellular matrix production as well as adhesion and biofilm formation in A. fumigatus.

Abstract: Summary
Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Cav) are essential for pancreatic beta cell function as they mediate Ca2+ influx, which leads to insulin exocytosis. The β3 subunit of Cav (Cavβ3) has been suggested to regulate cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) oscillation frequency and insulin secretion under physiological conditions, but its role in diabetes is unclear. Here, we report that islets from diabetic mice show Cavβ3 overexpression, altered [Ca2+]i dynamics, and impaired insulin secretion upon glucose stimulation. Consequently, in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetes, Cavβ3-deficient (Cavβ3−/−) mice showed improved islet function and enhanced glucose tolerance. Normalization of Cavβ3 expression in ob/ob islets by an antisense oligonucleotide rescued the altered [Ca2+]i dynamics and impaired insulin secretion. Importantly, transplantation of Cavβ3−/− islets into the anterior chamber of the eye improved glucose tolerance in HFD-fed mice. Cavβ3 overexpression in human islets also impaired insulin secretion. We thus suggest that Cavβ3 may serve as a druggable target for diabetes treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which feeding and fasting drive rhythmic gene expression for physiological adaptation to daily rhythm in nutrient availability are not well understood. Here we show that, upon feeding, the RNA-binding protein NONO accumulates within speckle-like structures in liver cell nuclei. Combining RNA-immunoprecipitation and sequencing (RIP-seq), we find that an increased number of RNAs are bound by NONO after feeding. We further show that NONO binds and regulates the rhythmicity of genes involved in nutrient metabolism post-transcriptionally. Finally, we show that disrupted rhythmicity of NONO target genes has profound metabolic impact. Indeed, NONO-deficient mice exhibit impaired glucose tolerance and lower hepatic glycogen and lipids. Accordingly, these mice shift from glucose storage to fat oxidation, and therefore remain lean throughout adulthood. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that NONO post-transcriptionally coordinates circadian mRNA expression of metabolic genes with the feeding/fasting cycle, thereby playing a critical role in energy homeostasis.
