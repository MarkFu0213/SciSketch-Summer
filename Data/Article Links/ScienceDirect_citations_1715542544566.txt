Abstract: Summary
In traumatic brain injury (TBI), a diversity of brain resident and peripherally derived myeloid cells have the potential to worsen damage and/or to assist in healing. We define the heterogeneity of microglia and macrophage phenotypes during TBI in wild-type (WT) mice and Ccr2−/− mice, which lack macrophage influx following TBI and are resistant to brain damage. We use unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing methods to uncover 25 microglia, monocyte/macrophage, and dendritic cell subsets in acute TBI and normal brains. We find alterations in transcriptional profiles of microglia subsets in Ccr2−/− TBI mice compared to WT TBI mice indicating that infiltrating monocytes/macrophages influence microglia activation to promote a type I IFN response. Preclinical pharmacological blockade of hCCR2 after injury reduces expression of IFN-responsive gene, Irf7, and improves outcomes. These data extend our understanding of myeloid cell diversity and crosstalk in brain trauma and identify therapeutic targets in myeloid subsets.

Abstract: Summary
Regulated insertion and removal of postsynaptic AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediates hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. In Alzheimer’s disease β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers may impair learning and memory by altering AMPAR trafficking and LTP/LTD balance. Importantly, Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) assembled from GluA1 subunits are excluded from hippocampal synapses basally but can be recruited rapidly during LTP and LTD to modify synaptic strength and signaling. By employing mouse knockin mutations that disrupt anchoring of the kinase PKA or phosphatase Calcineurin (CaN) to the postsynaptic scaffold protein AKAP150, we find that local AKAP-PKA signaling is required for CP-AMPAR recruitment, which can facilitate LTP but also, paradoxically, prime synapses for Aβ impairment of LTP mediated by local AKAP-CaN LTD signaling that promotes subsequent CP-AMPAR removal. These findings highlight the importance of PKA/CaN signaling balance and CP-AMPARs in normal plasticity and aberrant plasticity linked to disease.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for immunological tolerance and immune homeostasis. Treg cells strongly rely on mitochondrial metabolism and show a lower level of glycolysis. However, little is known about the role of lipid metabolism in the regulation of Treg cell homeostasis. Some members of the ACSL family of acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthases are expressed in T cells, but their function remains unclear. A combination of RNA-sequencing and proteome analyses shows that Acsbg1, a member of ACSL, is selectively expressed in Treg cells. We show that the genetic deletion of Acsbg1 not only causes mitochondrial dysfunction, but it also dampens other metabolic pathways. The extrinsic supplementation of Acsbg1-deficient Treg cells with oleoyl-CoA restores the phenotype of the Treg metabolic signature. Furthermore, this pathway in ST2+ effector Treg cells enhances immunosuppressive capacity in airway inflammation. Thus, Acsbg1 serves as a metabolic checkpoint governing Treg cell homeostasis and the resolution of lung inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Plants exhibit high regenerative capacity, which is controlled by various genetic factors. Here, we report that ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED 2 (ATXR2) controls de novo shoot organogenesis by regulating auxin-cytokinin interaction. The auxin-inducible ATXR2 Trithorax Group (TrxG) protein temporally interacts with the cytokinin-responsive type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 1 (ARR1) at early stages of shoot regeneration. The ATXR2-ARR1 complex binds to and deposits the H3K36me3 mark in the promoters of a subset of type-A ARR genes, ARR5 and ARR7, thus activating their expression. Consequently, the ATXR2/ARR1-type-A ARR module transiently represses cytokinin signaling and thereby de novo shoot regeneration. The atxr2-1 mutant calli exhibit enhanced shoot regeneration with low expression of ARR5 and ARR7, which ultimately upregulates WUSCHEL (WUS) expression. Thus, ATXR2 regulates cytokinin signaling and prevents premature WUS activation to ensure proper cell fate transition, and the auxin-cytokinin interaction underlies the initial specification of shoot meristem in callus.

Abstract: Summary
Fragile X-related protein-1 (FXR1) gene is highly amplified in patients with ovarian cancer, and this amplification is associated with increased expression of both FXR1 mRNA and protein. FXR1 expression directly associates with the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) assay demonstrates that FXR1 enhances the overall translation in cancer cells. Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) reveals that cMYC is the key target of FXR1. Mechanistically, FXR1 binds to the AU-rich elements (ARE) present within the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of cMYC and stabilizes its expression. In addition, the RGG domain in FXR1 interacts with eIF4A1 and eIF4E proteins. These two interactions of FXR1 result in the circularization of cMYC mRNA and facilitate the recruitment of eukaryotic translation initiation factors to the translation start site. In brief, we uncover a mechanism by which FXR1 promotes cMYC levels in cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane lipids and their metabolism have key functions in neurotransmission. Here we provide a quantitative lipid inventory of mouse and rat synaptic junctions. To this end, we developed a multiomics extraction and analysis workflow to probe the interplay of proteins and lipids in synaptic signal transduction from the same sample. Based on this workflow, we generate hypotheses about novel mechanisms underlying complex changes in synaptic connectivity elicited by environmental stimuli. As a proof of principle, this approach reveals that in mice exposed to an enriched environment, reduced endocannabinoid synthesis and signaling is linked to increased surface expression of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) in a subset of Cannabinoid-receptor 1 positive synapses. This mechanism regulates synaptic strength in an input-specific manner. Thus, we establish a compartment-specific multiomics workflow that is suitable to extract information from complex lipid and protein networks involved in synaptic function and plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, variants with enhanced virulence and transmissibility have emerged. Although in vitro systems allow rapid characterization, they do not fully recapitulate the dynamic interaction of virions and neutralizing antibodies in the airway. Here, we demonstrate that the N501Y variant permits respiratory infection in unmodified mice. We utilize N501Y to survey in vivo pseudovirus infection dynamics and susceptibility to reinfection with the L452R (Los Angeles), K417N + E484K (South Africa), and L452R + K417N + E484Q (India) variants. Human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)+ or vaccinated antibody isotypes, titers, variant receptor binding domain (RBD) binding, and neutralization potential are studied, revealing numerous significant correlations. Immune escape of the K417N + E484K variant is observed because infection can be appreciated in the nasopharynx, but not lungs, of mice transferred with low-antibody-tier plasma. Conversely, near-complete protection is observed in animals receiving high-antibody-tier plasma, a phenomenon that can only be appreciated in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enters the nucleus to establish infection, but the role of nuclear envelope proteins in this process is incompletely understood. Inner nuclear transmembrane proteins SUN1 and SUN2 connect nuclear lamins to the cytoskeleton and participate in the DNA damage response (DDR). Increased levels of SUN1 or SUN2 potently restrict HIV infection through an unresolved mechanism. Here, we find that the antiviral activities of SUN1 and SUN2 are distinct. HIV-1 and HIV-2 are preferentially inhibited by SUN1 and SUN2, respectively. We identify DNA damage inducers that stimulate HIV-1 infection and show that SUN1, but not SUN2, neutralizes this effect. Finally, we show that chromatin movements and nuclear rotations are associated with the effects of SUN proteins and Lamin A/C on infection. These results reveal an emerging role of chromatin dynamics and the DDR in the control of HIV infection by structural components of the nuclear envelope.

Abstract: The development of new vaccines for TB needs to be underpinned by an understanding of both the molecular and cellular mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions and how the immune response can be modulated to achieve protection from disease. Complement orchestrates many aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, little is known about the contribution of the complement pathways during TB disease, particularly with respect to mycobacterial phenotype. Extracellular communities (biofilms) of M. tuberculosis are found in the acellular rim of granulomas, during disease, and these are likely to be present in post-primary TB episodes, in necrotic lesions. Our study aimed to determine which mycobacterial cell wall components were altered during biofilm growth and how these cell wall alterations modified the complement response. We have shown that M. tuberculosis biofilms modified their cell wall carbohydrates and elicited reduced classical and lectin pathway activation. Consistent with this finding was the reduction of C3b/iC3b deposition on biofilm cell wall carbohydrate extracts. Here, we have highlighted the role of cell wall carbohydrate alterations during biofilm growth of M. tuberculosis and subsequent modulation of complement activation.

Abstract: Summary
Both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter receptors can influence maturation and survival of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus; nevertheless, how these two neurotransmitter systems affect integration of new neurons into the existing circuitry is still not fully characterized. Here, we demonstrate that glutamate receptors of the kainate receptor (KAR) subfamily are expressed in adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) and that, through their interaction with GABAergic signaling mechanisms, they alter the functional properties of adult-born cells during a critical period of their development. Both the intrinsic properties and synaptic connectivity of young abDGCs were affected. Timed KAR loss in a cohort of young adult-born neurons in mice disrupted their performance in a spatial discrimination task but not in a hippocampal-dependent fear conditioning task. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of KARs in the proper functional development of young abDGCs.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a transient, reversible process of cell de-differentiation where cancer cells transit between various stages of an EMT continuum, including epithelial, partial EMT, and mesenchymal cell states. We have employed Tamoxifen-inducible dual recombinase lineage tracing systems combined with live imaging and 5-cell RNA sequencing to track cancer cells undergoing partial or full EMT in the MMTV-PyMT mouse model of metastatic breast cancer. In primary tumors, cancer cells infrequently undergo EMT and mostly transition between epithelial and partial EMT states but rarely reach full EMT. Cells undergoing partial EMT contribute to lung metastasis and chemoresistance, whereas full EMT cells mostly retain a mesenchymal phenotype and fail to colonize the lungs. However, full EMT cancer cells are enriched in recurrent tumors upon chemotherapy. Hence, cancer cells in various stages of the EMT continuum differentially contribute to hallmarks of breast cancer malignancy, such as tumor invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin remodelers play dosage-sensitive roles in many human malignancies and neurologic disorders. The gene encoding the BAF subunit actin-like 6a (ACTL6A) is amplified early in the development of many squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), but its oncogenic role remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that ACTL6A overexpression leads to its stoichiometric assembly into BAF complexes and drives their interaction and engagement with specific regulatory regions in the genome. In normal epithelial cells, ACTL6A was substoichiometric to other BAF subunits. However, increased ACTL6A levels by ectopic expression or in SCC cells led to near saturation of ACTL6A within BAF complexes. Increased ACTL6A occupancy enhanced polycomb opposition genome-wide to activate SCC genes and facilitated the co-dependent loading of BAF and TEAD-YAP complexes on chromatin. Both mechanisms appeared to be critical and function as a molecular AND gate for SCC initiation and maintenance, thereby explaining the specificity of the role of ACTL6A amplification in SCCs.

Abstract: CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) critically contributes to 3D chromatin organization by determining topologically associated domain (TAD) borders. Although CTCF primarily binds at TAD borders, there also exist putative CTCF-binding sites within TADs, which are spread throughout the genome by retrotransposition. However, the detailed mechanism responsible for masking the putative CTCF-binding sites remains largely elusive. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler, chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 4 (CHD4), regulates chromatin accessibility to conceal aberrant CTCF-binding sites embedded in H3K9me3-enriched heterochromatic B2 short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Upon CHD4 depletion, these aberrant CTCF-binding sites become accessible and aberrant CTCF recruitment occurs within TADs, resulting in disorganization of local TADs. RNA-binding intrinsically disordered domains (IDRs) of CHD4 are required to prevent this aberrant CTCF binding, and CHD4 is critical for the repression of B2 SINE transcripts. These results collectively reveal that a CHD4-mediated mechanism ensures appropriate CTCF binding and associated TAD organization in mESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Central to genotoxic responses is their ability to sense highly specific signals to activate the appropriate repair response. We previously reported that the activation of the ASCC-ALKBH3 repair pathway is exquisitely specific to alkylation damage in human cells. Yet the mechanistic basis for the selectivity of this pathway was not immediately obvious. Here, we demonstrate that RNA but not DNA alkylation is the initiating signal for this process. Aberrantly methylated RNA is sufficient to recruit ASCC, while an RNA dealkylase suppresses ASCC recruitment during chemical alkylation. In turn, recruitment of ASCC during alkylation damage, which is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF113A, suppresses transcription and R-loop formation. We further show that alkylated pre-mRNA is sufficient to activate RNF113A E3 ligase in vitro in a manner dependent on its RNA binding Zn-finger domain. Together, our work identifies an unexpected role for RNA damage in eliciting a specific response to genotoxins.

Abstract: Summary
We combine advances in neural language modeling and structurally motivated design to develop D-SCRIPT, an interpretable and generalizable deep-learning model, which predicts interaction between two proteins using only their sequence and maintains high accuracy with limited training data and across species. We show that a D-SCRIPT model trained on 38,345 human PPIs enables significantly improved functional characterization of fly proteins compared with the state-of-the-art approach. Evaluating the same D-SCRIPT model on protein complexes with known 3D structure, we find that the inter-protein contact map output by D-SCRIPT has significant overlap with the ground truth. We apply D-SCRIPT to screen for PPIs in cow (Bos taurus) at a genome-wide scale and focusing on rumen physiology, identify functional gene modules related to metabolism and immune response. The predicted interactions can then be leveraged for function prediction at scale, addressing the genome-to-phenome challenge, especially in species where little data are available.

Abstract: Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing an anti-rabies monoclonal antibody (mAb), SO57, was obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip transformation. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) was tagged to the C-terminus of the anti-rabies mAb heavy chain to localize the mAb to the ER and enhance its accumulation. When the inaccurately folded proteins accumulated in the ER exceed its storage capacity, it results in stress that can affect plant development and growth. We generated T1 transformants and obtained homozygous T3 seeds from transgenic Arabidopsis to investigate the effect of KDEL on plant growth. The germination rate did not significantly differ between plants expressing mAb SO57 without KDEL (SO plant) and mAb SO57 with KDEL (SOK plant). The primary roots of SOK agar media grown plants were slightly shorter than those of SO plants. Transcriptomic analysis showed that expression of all 11 ER stress-related genes were not significantly changed in SOK plants relative to SO plants. SOK plants showed approximately three-fold higher mAb expression levels than those of SO plants. Consequently, the purified mAb amount per unit of SOK plant biomass was approximately three times higher than that of SO plants. A neutralization assay revealed that both plants exhibited efficient rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test values against the rabies virus relative to commercially available human rabies immunoglobulins. KDEL did not upregulate ER stress-related genes; therefore, the enhanced production of the mAb did not affect plant growth. Thus, KDEL fusion is recommended for enhancing mAb production in plant systems.

Abstract: Summary
Swallowing is an essential step of eating and drinking. However, how the quality of a food bolus is sensed by pharyngeal neurons is largely unknown. Here we find that mechanical receptors along the Drosophila pharynx are required for control of meal size, especially for food of high viscosity. The mechanical force exerted by the bolus passing across the pharynx is detected by neurons expressing the mechanotransduction channel NOMPC (no mechanoreceptor potential C) and is relayed, together with gustatory information, to IN1 neurons in the subesophageal zone (SEZ) of the brain. IN1 (ingestion neurons) neurons act directly upstream of a group of peptidergic neurons that encode satiety. Prolonged activation of IN1 neurons suppresses feeding. IN1 neurons receive inhibition from DSOG1 (descending subesophageal neurons) neurons, a group of GABAergic neurons that non-selectively suppress feeding. Our results reveal the function of pharyngeal mechanoreceptors and their downstream neural circuits in the control of food ingestion.

Abstract: The aberrant release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium leads to the disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis, which is associated with the occurrence of ER stress and closely related to the pathogenesis of liver damage. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a soluble calcium-dependent protein synthesized primarily in hepatocytes and is a pattern recognition molecule in the innate immune system. MBL deficiency is highly prevalent in the population and has been reported to be associated with susceptibility to several liver diseases. We here showed that genetic MBL ablation strongly sensitized mice to ER stress-induced liver injury. Mechanistic studies established that MBL directly interacted with ER-resident chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP), and MBL deficiency accelerated the separation of PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) from BiP during hepatic ER stress. Moreover, MBL deficiency led to enhanced activation of the PERK-C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) pathway and initiates an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-mediated calcium release from the ER, thereby aggravating the hepatic ER stress response. Our results demonstrate an unexpected function of MBL in ER calcium homeostasis and ER stress response, thus providing new insight into the liver injury related to ER stress in patients with MBL deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome exhibits extreme compositional variation between hominid hosts. However, it is unclear how this variation impacts host physiology across species and whether this effect can be mediated through microbial regulation of host gene expression in interacting epithelial cells. Here, we characterize the transcriptional response of human colonic epithelial cells in vitro to live microbial communities extracted from humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. We find that most host genes exhibit a conserved response, whereby they respond similarly to the four hominid microbiomes. However, hundreds of host genes exhibit a divergent response, whereby they respond only to microbiomes from specific host species. Such genes are associated with intestinal diseases in humans, including inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn’s disease. Last, we find that inflammation-associated microbial species regulate the expression of host genes previously associated with inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting health-related consequences for species-specific host-microbiome interactions across hominids.

Abstract: Summary
Strengthening the gut epithelial barrier is a potential strategy for management of gut microbiota-associated illnesses. Here, we demonstrate that dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (Dusp6) knockout enhances baseline colon barrier integrity and ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colonic injury. DUSP6 mutation in Caco-2 cells enhances the epithelial feature and increases mitochondrial oxygen consumption, accompanied by altered glucose metabolism and decreased glycolysis. We find that Dusp6-knockout mice are more resistant to DSS-induced dysbiosis, and the cohousing and fecal microbiota transplantation experiments show that the gut/fecal microbiota derived from Dusp6-knockout mice also confers protection against colitis. Further culturomics and mono-colonialization experiments show that one gut microbiota member in the genus Duncaniella confers host protection from DSS-induced injury. We identify Dusp6 deficiency as beneficial for shaping the gut microbiota eubiosis necessary to protect against gut barrier-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Transcranial neurostimulation methods are utilized as therapies for various neuropsychiatric disorders. Primarily, they entail the delivery of weak subthreshold currents across the brain, which modulate neuronal excitability. However, it is still a puzzle how such weak electrical fields actuate their effects. Previous studies showed that axons are the most sensitive subcellular compartment for direct current stimulation, and maximal polarization is achieved at their terminals. Nonetheless, polarization of axon terminals according to models was predicted to be weak, and the mechanism for substantial axon terminals polarization was obscure. Here, we show that a weak subthreshold electrical field modifies the conductance of voltage-dependent sodium channels in axon terminals, subsequently amplifying their membrane polarization. Moreover, we show that this amplification has substantial effects on synaptic functioning. Finally, we employ analytical modeling to explain how sodium currents modifications enhance axon terminal polarization. These findings relate to the mechanistic aspects of any neurostimulation technique.

Abstract: Summary
Embryos repair wounds rapidly, with no inflammation or scarring, in a process that involves polarization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Actomyosin polarization results in the assembly of a contractile cable around the wound that drives wound closure. Here, we demonstrate that a contractile actomyosin cable is not sufficient for rapid wound repair in Drosophila embryos. We show that wounding causes activation of the serine/threonine kinase p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the cells adjacent to the wound. p38 activation reduces the levels of wound-induced reactive oxygen species in the cells around the wound, limiting wound size. In addition, p38 promotes an increase in volume in the cells around the wound, thus facilitating the collective cell movements that drive rapid wound healing. Our data indicate that p38 regulates cell volumes through the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter NKCC1. Our work reveals cell growth and cell survival as cell behaviors critical for embryonic wound repair.

Abstract: Summary
A core network of widely expressed proteins within the glutamatergic post-synapse mediates activity-dependent synaptic plasticity throughout the brain, but the specific proteomic composition of synapses differs between brain regions. Here, we address the question, how does proteomic composition affect activity-dependent protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) downstream of synaptic activity? Using quantitative multiplex co-immunoprecipitation, we compare the PIN response of in vivo or ex vivo neurons derived from different brain regions to activation by different agonists or different forms of eyeblink conditioning. We report that PINs discriminate between incoming stimuli using differential kinetics of overlapping and non-overlapping PIN parameters. Further, these “molecular logic rules” differ by brain region. We conclude that although the PIN of the glutamatergic post-synapse is expressed widely throughout the brain, its activity-dependent dynamics show remarkable stimulus-specific and brain-region-specific diversity. This diversity may help explain the challenges in developing molecule-specific drug therapies for neurological disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Methods derived from CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag enable genome-wide mapping of the localization of proteins on chromatin from as few as one cell. These and other mapping approaches focus on one protein at a time, preventing direct measurements of co-localization of different chromatin proteins in the same cells and requiring prioritization of targets where samples are limiting. Here, we describe multi-CUT&Tag, an adaptation of CUT&Tag that overcomes these hurdles by using antibody-specific barcodes to simultaneously map multiple proteins in the same cells. Highly specific multi-CUT&Tag maps of histone marks and RNA Polymerase II uncovered sites of co-localization in the same cells, active and repressed genes, and candidate cis-regulatory elements. Single-cell multi-CUT&Tag profiling facilitated identification of distinct cell types from a mixed population and characterization of cell-type-specific chromatin architecture. In sum, multi-CUT&Tag increases the information content per cell of epigenomic maps, facilitating direct analysis of the interplay of different chromatin proteins.

The Danger-Associated Peptide PEP1 Directs Cellular Reprogramming in the Arabidopsis Root Vascular System,

Abstract: When perceiving microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) or plant-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), plants alter their root growth and development by displaying a reduction in the root length and the formation of root hairs and lateral roots. The exogenous application of a MAMP peptide, flg22, was shown to affect root growth by suppressing meristem activity. In addition to MAMPs, the DAMP peptide PEP1 suppresses root growth while also promoting root hair formation. However, the question of whether and how these elicitor peptides affect the development of the vascular system in the root has not been explored. The cellular receptors of PEP1, PEPR1 and PEPR2 are highly expressed in the root vascular system, while the receptors of flg22 (FLS2) and elf18 (EFR) are not. Consistent with the expression patterns of PEP1 receptors, we found that exogenously applied PEP1 has a strong impact on the division of stele cells, leading to a reduction of these cells. We also observed the alteration in the number and organization of cells that differentiate into xylem vessels. These PEP1-mediated developmental changes appear to be linked to the blockage of symplastic connections triggered by PEP1. PEP1 dramatically disrupts the symplastic movement of free green fluorescence protein (GFP) from phloem sieve elements to neighboring cells in the root meristem, leading to the deposition of a high level of callose between cells. Taken together, our first survey of PEP1-mediated vascular tissue development provides new insights into the PEP1 function as a regulator of cellular reprogramming in the Arabidopsis root vascular system.

Abstract: Summary
CD19-CAR T cell therapy has evolved into the standard of care for relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, limited persistence of the CAR T cells enables tumor relapse for many patients. To gain a deeper understanding of the molecular characteristics associated with CAR T cell differentiation, we performed longitudinal genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of CD8+ CD19-CAR T cells post-infusion in ALL patients. We report that CAR T cells undergo a rapid and broad erasure of repressive DNA methylation reprograms at effector-associated genes. The CAR T cell post-infusion changes are further characterized by repression of genes (e.g., TCF7 and LEF1) associated with memory potential and a DNA methylation signature (e.g., demethylation at CX3CR1, BATF, and TOX) demarcating a transition toward exhaustion-progenitor T cells. Thus, CD19-CAR T cells undergo exhaustion-associated DNA methylation programming, indicating that efforts to prevent this process may be an attractive approach to improve CAR T cell efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
In diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), tumors belonging to the ABC but not GCB gene expression subgroup rely upon chronic active B cell receptor signaling for viability, a dependency that is targetable by ibrutinib. A phase III trial (“Phoenix;” ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01855750) showed a survival benefit of ibrutinib addition to R-CHOP chemotherapy in younger patients with non-GCB DLBCL, but the molecular basis for this benefit was unclear. Analysis of biopsies from Phoenix trial patients revealed three previously characterized genetic subtypes of DLBCL: MCD, BN2, and N1. The 3-year event-free survival of younger patients (age ≤60 years) treated with ibrutinib plus R-CHOP was 100% in the MCD and N1 subtypes while the survival of patients with these subtypes treated with R-CHOP alone was significantly inferior (42.9% and 50%, respectively). This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the benefit of ibrutinib addition to chemotherapy, supporting its use in younger patients with non-GCB DLBCL.

Abstract: Summary
β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) is an essential metabolic energy source during fasting and functions as a chromatin regulator by lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) modification of the core histones H3 and H4. We report that Kbhb on histone H3 (H3K9bhb) is enriched at proximal promoters of critical gene subsets associated with lipolytic and ketogenic metabolic pathways in small intestine (SI) crypts during fasting. Similar Kbhb enrichment is observed in Lgr5+ stem cell-enriched epithelial spheroids treated with β-OHB in vitro. Combinatorial chromatin state analysis reveals that H3K9bhb is associated with active chromatin states and that fasting enriches for an H3K9bhb-H3K27ac signature at active metabolic gene promoters and distal enhancer elements. Intestinal knockout of Hmgcs2 results in marked loss of H3K9bhb-associated loci, suggesting that local production of β-OHB is responsible for chromatin reprogramming within the SI crypt. We conclude that modulation of H3K9bhb in SI crypts is a key gene regulatory event in response to fasting.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating memory CD8 T cell trafficking and protective capacity during liver-stage malaria infection remains undefined. We find that effector memory CD8 T cells (Tem) infiltrate the liver within 6 hours after malarial or bacterial infections and mediate pathogen clearance. Tem recruitment coincides with rapid transcriptional upregulation of inflammatory genes in Plasmodium-infected livers. Recruitment requires CD8 T cell-intrinsic LFA-1 expression and the presence of liver phagocytes. Rapid Tem liver infiltration is distinct from recruitment to other non-lymphoid tissues in that it occurs both in the absence of liver tissue resident memory “sensing-and-alarm” function and ∼42 hours earlier than in lung infection by influenza virus. These data demonstrate relevance for Tem in protection against malaria and provide generalizable mechanistic insights germane to control of liver infections.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity-induced inflammation is a major driving force in the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and related metabolic disorders. During obesity, macrophages accumulate in the visceral adipose tissue, creating a low-grade inflammatory environment. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling is a central coordinator of inflammatory responses and is tightly regulated by the anti-inflammatory protein A20. Here, we find that myeloid-specific A20-deficient mice are protected from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance despite an inflammatory environment in their metabolic tissues. Macrophages lacking A20 show impaired mitochondrial respiratory function and metabolize more palmitate both in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that A20-deficient macrophages rely more on palmitate oxidation and metabolize the fat present in the diet, resulting in a lean phenotype and protection from metabolic disease. These findings reveal a role for A20 in regulating macrophage immunometabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The AAA+ ATPase VCP regulates the extraction of SUMO and ubiquitin-modified DNA replication factors from chromatin. We have previously described that active DNA synthesis is associated with a SUMO-high/ubiquitin-low environment governed by the deubiquitylase USP7. Here, we unveil a functional cooperation between USP7 and VCP in DNA replication, which is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals. The role of VCP in chromatin is defined by its cofactor FAF1, which facilitates the extraction of SUMOylated and ubiquitylated proteins that accumulate after the block of DNA replication in the absence of USP7. The inactivation of USP7 and FAF1 is synthetically lethal both in C. elegans and mammalian cells. In addition, USP7 and VCP inhibitors display synergistic toxicity supporting a functional link between deubiquitylation and extraction of chromatin-bound proteins. Our results suggest that USP7 and VCPFAF1 facilitate DNA replication by controlling the balance of SUMO/Ubiquitin-modified DNA replication factors on chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
As pluripotent human embryonic stem cells progress toward one germ layer fate, they lose the ability to adopt alternative fates. Using a low-dimensional reaction coordinate to monitor progression toward ectoderm, we show that a differentiating stem cell’s probability of adopting a mesendodermal fate given appropriate signals falls sharply at a point along the ectoderm trajectory. We use this reaction coordinate to prospectively isolate and profile differentiating cells based on their mesendoderm competence and analyze their RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) profiles to identify transcription factors that control the cell’s mesendoderm competence. By modulating these key transcription factors, we can expand or contract the window of competence to adopt the mesendodermal fate along the ectodermal differentiation trajectory. The ability of the underlying gene regulatory network to modulate competence is essential for understanding human development and controlling the fate choices of stem cells in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as functional units in cancer and powerful biomarkers; however, most remain uncharacterized. Here, we analyze 5,592 prognostic lncRNAs in 9,446 cancers of 30 types using machine learning. We identify 166 lncRNAs whose expression correlates with survival and improves the accuracy of common clinical variables, molecular features, and cancer subtypes. Prognostic lncRNAs are often characterized by switch-like expression patterns. In low-grade gliomas, HOXA10-AS activation is a robust marker of poor prognosis that complements IDH1/2 mutations, as validated in another retrospective cohort, and correlates with developmental pathways in tumor transcriptomes. Loss- and gain-of-function studies in patient-derived glioma cells, organoids, and xenograft models identify HOXA10-AS as a potent onco-lncRNA that regulates cell proliferation, contact inhibition, invasion, Hippo signaling, and mitotic and neuro-developmental pathways. Our study underscores the pan-cancer potential of the non-coding transcriptome for identifying biomarkers and regulators of cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified hundreds of signals associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). To gain insight into their underlying molecular mechanisms, we have created the translational human pancreatic islet genotype tissue-expression resource (TIGER), aggregating >500 human islet genomic datasets from five cohorts in the Horizon 2020 consortium T2DSystems. We impute genotypes using four reference panels and meta-analyze cohorts to improve the coverage of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and develop a method to combine allele-specific expression across samples (cASE). We identify >1 million islet eQTLs, 53 of which colocalize with T2D signals. Among them, a low-frequency allele that reduces T2D risk by half increases CCND2 expression. We identify eight cASE colocalizations, among which we found a T2D-associated SLC30A8 variant. We make all data available through the TIGER portal (http://tiger.bsc.es), which represents a comprehensive human islet genomic data resource to elucidate how genetic variation affects islet function and translates into therapeutic insight and precision medicine for T2D.

Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed extensive molecular diversity in gene programs governing mammalian spermatogenesis but fails to delineate their dynamics in the native context of seminiferous tubules, the spatially confined functional units of spermatogenesis. Here, we use Slide-seq, a spatial transcriptomics technology, to generate an atlas that captures the spatial gene expression patterns at near-single-cell resolution in the mouse and human testis. Using Slide-seq data, we devise a computational framework that accurately localizes testicular cell types in individual seminiferous tubules. Unbiased analysis systematically identifies spatially patterned genes and gene programs. Combining Slide-seq with targeted in situ RNA sequencing, we demonstrate significant differences in the cellular compositions of spermatogonial microenvironment between mouse and human testes. Finally, a comparison of the spatial atlas generated from the wild-type and diabetic mouse testis reveals a disruption in the spatial cellular organization of seminiferous tubules as a potential mechanism of diabetes-induced male infertility.

Abstract: Summary
Regenerative neuroscience aims to stimulate endogenous repair in the nervous system to replace neurons lost from degenerative diseases. Recently, we reported that overexpressing the transcription factor Ascl1 in Müller glia (MG) is sufficient to stimulate MG to regenerate functional neurons in the adult mouse retina. However, this process is inefficient, and only a third of the Ascl1-expressing MG generate new neurons. Here, we test whether proneural transcription factors of the Atoh1/7 class can further promote the regenerative capacity of MG. We find that the combination of Ascl1:Atoh1 is remarkably efficient at stimulating neurogenesis, even in the absence of retinal injury. Using electrophysiology and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we demonstrate that Ascl1:Atoh1 generates a diversity of retinal neuron types, with the majority expressing characteristics of retinal ganglion cells. Our results provide a proof of principle that combinations of developmental transcription factors can substantially improve glial reprogramming to neurons and expand the repertoire of regenerated cell fates.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal stress can have long-lasting epigenetic effects on offspring. To examine how epigenetic changes are triggered by stress, we examined the effects of activating the universal stress-responsive heat shock transcription factor HSF-1 in the germline of Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that, when activated in germ cells, HSF-1 recruits MET-2, the putative histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase responsible for repressive H3K9me2 (H3K9 dimethyl) marks in chromatin, and negatively bookmarks the insulin receptor daf-2 and other HSF-1 target genes. Increased H3K9me2 at these genes persists in adult progeny and shifts their stress response strategy away from inducible chaperone expression as a mechanism to survive stress and instead rely on decreased insulin/insulin growth factor (IGF-1)-like signaling (IIS). Depending on the duration of maternal heat stress exposure, this epigenetic memory is inherited by the next generation. Thus, paradoxically, HSF-1 recruits the germline machinery normally responsible for erasing transcriptional memory but, instead, establishes a heritable epigenetic memory of prior stress exposure.

Abstract: Summary
The Notch signaling pathway controls cell growth, differentiation, and fate decisions, and its dysregulation has been linked to various human genetic disorders and cancers. To comprehensively understand the global organization of the Notch pathway and identify potential drug targets for Notch-related diseases, we established a protein interaction landscape for the human Notch pathway. By combining and analyzing genetic and phenotypic data with bioinformatics analysis, we greatly expanded this pathway and identified many key regulators, including low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). We demonstrated that LRP1 mediates the ubiquitination chain linkage switching of Delta ligands, which further affects ligand recycling, membrane localization, and stability. LRP1 inhibition led to Notch signaling inhibition and decreased tumorigenesis in leukemia models. Our study provides a glimpse into the Notch pathway interaction network and uncovers LRP1 as one critical regulator of the Notch pathway, as well as a possible therapeutic target for Notch-related cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Gene regulation often results from the action of multiple transcription factors (TFs) acting at a promoter, obscuring the individual regulatory effect of each TF on RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here we measure the fundamental regulatory interactions of TFs in E. coli by designing synthetic target genes that isolate individual TFs’ regulatory effects. Using a thermodynamic model, each TF’s regulatory interactions are decoupled from TF occupancy and interpreted as acting through (de)stabilization of RNAP and (de)acceleration of transcription initiation. We find that the contribution of each mechanism depends on TF identity and binding location; regulation immediately downstream of the promoter is insensitive to TF identity, but the same TFs regulate by distinct mechanisms upstream of the promoter. These two mechanisms are uncoupled and can act coherently, to reinforce the observed regulatory role (activation/repression), or incoherently, wherein the TF regulates two distinct steps with opposing effects.

Abstract: Summary
In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the benefit of combining chemotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is still not very clear. We utilize single-cell RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to examine the immune cell dynamics in 22 patients with advanced TNBC treated with paclitaxel or its combination with the anti-PD-L1 atezolizumab. We demonstrate that high levels of baseline CXCL13+ T cells are linked to the proinflammatory features of macrophages and can predict effective responses to the combination therapy. In responsive patients, lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, follicular B (Bfoc) cells, CXCL13+ T cells, and conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) concertedly increase following the combination therapy, but instead decrease after paclitaxel monotherapy. Our data highlight the importance of CXCL13+ T cells in effective responses to anti-PD-L1 therapies and suggest that their reduction by paclitaxel regimen may compromise the clinical outcomes of accompanying atezolizumab for TNBC treatment.

Abstract: Plant somatic cells can be reprogrammed into a pluripotent cell mass, called callus, which can be subsequently used for de novo shoot regeneration through a two-step in vitro tissue culture method. MET1-dependent CG methylation has been implicated in plant regeneration in Arabidopsis, because the met1-3 mutant exhibits increased shoot regeneration compared with the wild-type. To understand the role of MET1 in de novo shoot regeneration, we compared the genome-wide DNA methylomes and transcriptomes of wild-type and met1-3 callus and leaf. The CG methylation patterns were largely unchanged during leaf-to-callus transition, suggesting that the altered regeneration phenotype of met1-3 was caused by the constitutively hypomethylated genes, independent of the tissue type. In particular, MET1-dependent CG methylation was observed at the blue light receptor genes, CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1) and CRY2, which reduced their expression. Coexpression network analysis revealed that the CRY1 gene was closely linked to cytokinin signaling genes. Consistently, functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in met1-3 showed that gene ontology terms related to light and hormone signaling were overrepresented. Overall, our findings indicate that MET1-dependent repression of light and cytokinin signaling influences plant regeneration capacity and shoot identity establishment.

Abstract: Summary
Many prokaryotic cells are covered by an ordered, proteinaceous, sheet-like structure called a surface layer (S-layer). S-layer proteins (SLPs) are usually the highest copy number macromolecules in prokaryotes, playing critical roles in cellular physiology such as blocking predators, scaffolding membranes, and facilitating environmental interactions. Using electron cryomicroscopy of two-dimensional sheets, we report the atomic structure of the S-layer from the archaeal model organism Haloferax volcanii. This S-layer consists of a hexagonal array of tightly interacting immunoglobulin-like domains, which are also found in SLPs across several classes of archaea. Cellular tomography reveal that the S-layer is nearly continuous on the cell surface, completed by pentameric defects in the hexagonal lattice. We further report the atomic structure of the SLP pentamer, which shows markedly different relative arrangements of SLP domains needed to complete the S-layer. Our structural data provide a framework for understanding cell surfaces of archaea at the atomic level.

Abstract: Summary
Optical implants to control and monitor neuronal activity in vivo have become foundational tools of neuroscience. Standard two-dimensional histology of the implant location, however, often suffers from distortion and loss during tissue processing. To address that, we developed a three-dimensional post hoc histology method called “light-guided sectioning” (LiGS), which preserves the tissue with its optical implant in place and allows staining and clearing of a volume up to 500 μm in depth. We demonstrate the use of LiGS to determine the precise location of an optical fiber relative to a deep brain target and to investigate the implant-tissue interface. We show accurate cell registration of ex vivo histology with single-cell, two-photon calcium imaging, obtained through gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses, and identify subpopulations based on immunohistochemistry. LiGS provides spatial information in experimental paradigms that use optical fibers and GRIN lenses and could help increase reproducibility through identification of fiber-to-target localization and molecular profiling.

Abstract: Summary
Ketamine is a noncompetitive glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist that exerts rapid antidepressant effects. Preclinical studies identify eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) signaling as essential for the rapid antidepressant action of ketamine. Here, we combine genetic, electrophysiological, and pharmacological strategies to investigate the role of eEF2K in synaptic function and find that acute, but not chronic, inhibition of eEF2K activity induces rapid synaptic scaling in the hippocampus. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling also elicits a similar form of rapid synaptic scaling in the hippocampus, which we observe is independent of eEF2K functioni. The RA signaling pathway is not required for ketamine-mediated antidepressant action; however, direct activation of the retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) evokes rapid antidepressant action resembling ketamine. Our findings show that ketamine and RARα activation independently elicit a similar form of multiplicative synaptic scaling that is causal for rapid antidepressant action.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose homeostasis is initially regulated by the pancreatic hormone insulin. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β-cells is composed of two cellular mechanisms: a high glucose concentration not only depolarizes the membrane potential of the β-cells by ATP-sensitive K+ channels but also induces cell inflation, which is sufficient to release insulin granules. However, the molecular identity of the stretch-activated cation channel responsible for the latter pathway remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Tentonin 3/TMEM150C (TTN3), a mechanosensitive channel, contributes to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by mediating cation influx. TTN3 is expressed specifically in β-cells and mediates cation currents to glucose and hypotonic stimulations. The glucose-induced depolarization, firing activity, and Ca2+ influx of β-cells were significantly lower in Ttn3−/− mice. More importantly, Ttn3−/− mice show impaired glucose tolerance with decreased insulin secretion in vivo. We propose that TTN3, as a stretch-activated cation channel, contributes to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

Abstract: Summary
One of the defining characteristics of a pre-metastatic niche, a fundamental requirement for primary tumor metastasis, is infiltration of immunosuppressive macrophages. How these macrophages acquire their phenotype remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) polarize macrophages toward an immunosuppressive phenotype characterized by increased PD-L1 expression through NF-kB-dependent, glycolytic-dominant metabolic reprogramming. TDE signaling through TLR2 and NF-κB leads to increased glucose uptake. TDEs also stimulate elevated NOS2, which inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation resulting in increased conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Lactate feeds back on NF-κB, further increasing PD-L1. Analysis of metastasis-negative lymph nodes of non-small-cell lung cancer patients revealed that macrophage PD-L1 positively correlates with levels of GLUT-1 and vesicle release gene YKT6 from primary tumors. Collectively, our study provides a novel mechanism by which macrophages within a pre-metastatic niche acquire their immunosuppressive phenotype and identifies an important link among exosomes, metabolism, and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Drinking behavior in rodents is characterized by stereotyped, rhythmic licking movement, which is regulated by the basal ganglia. It is unclear how direct and indirect pathways control the lick bout and individual spout contact. We find that inactivating D1 and D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the ventrolateral striatum (VLS) oppositely alters the number of licks in a bout. D1- and D2-MSNs exhibit different patterns of lick-sequence-related activity and different phases of oscillation time-locked to the lick cycle. On the timescale of a lick cycle, transient inactivation of D1-MSNs during tongue protrusion reduces spout contact probability, whereas transiently inactivating D2-MSNs has no effect. On the timescale of a lick bout, inactivation of D1-MSNs (D2-MSNs) causes rate increase (decrease) in a subset of basal ganglia output neurons that decrease firing during licking. Our results reveal the distinct roles of D1- and D2-MSNs in regulating licking at both coarse and fine timescales.

Abstract: Summary
A variety of mechanosensory neurons are involved in touch, proprioception, and pain. Many molecular components of the mechanotransduction machinery subserving these sensory modalities remain to be discovered. Here, we combine recordings of mechanosensitive (MS) currents in mechanosensory neurons with single-cell RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiles are mapped onto previously identified sensory neuron types to identify cell-type correlates between datasets. Correlation of current signatures with single-cell transcriptomes provides a one-to-one correspondence between mechanoelectric properties and transcriptomically defined neuronal populations. Moreover, a gene-expression differential comparison provides a set of candidate genes for mechanotransduction complexes. Piezo2 is expectedly found to be enriched in rapidly adapting MS current-expressing neurons, whereas Tmem120a and Tmem150c, thought to mediate slow-type MS currents, are uniformly expressed in all mechanosensory neuron subtypes. Further knockdown experiments disqualify them as mediating MS currents in sensory neurons. This dataset constitutes an open resource to explore further the cell-type-specific determinants of mechanosensory properties.

Abstract: Summary
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) by invading urothelial cells. In response, the host mounts an inflammatory response to expel bacteria. Here, we show that the NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway is activated in response to UPEC-triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We demonstrate the molecular sequence of events wherein NRF2 activation in urothelial cells reduces ROS production, inflammation, and cell death, promotes UPEC expulsion, and reduces the bacterial load. In contrast, loss of NRF2 leads to increased ROS production, bacterial burden, and inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. NRF2 promotes UPEC expulsion by regulating transcription of the RAB-GTPase RAB27B. Finally, dimethyl fumarate, a US Food and Administration-approved NRF2 inducer, reduces the inflammatory response, increases RAB27B expression, and lowers bacterial burden in urothelial cells and in a mouse UTI model. Our findings elucidate mechanisms underlying the host response to UPEC and provide a potential strategy to combat UTIs.

Abstract: The neuroprotective function of miR-194 on neurovascular endothelial cell injury is perceived as a novel method for clinical therapy. So are exosomes (EXs), being attractive in neurofunctional recovery. However, whether EXs derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) perform the same efficacy by transferring miR-194 and the underlying mechanism remain vague. This study rooted in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model. MSCs were isolated by gradient centrifugation and identified by flow cytometry. EXs were obtained through ultracentrifugation, whereas protein levels of specific markers (CD63, TGS101), together with Bach1, Nrf2 and HO-1 were measured by western blot. The relative mRNA expressions of Bach1, NOX1, AGSL4, GPX4 and miR-194 were measured by RT-qPCR assays. Cell viability was measured by cell counting kit-8, and cell migration was detected by wound healing assay. The interaction between miR-194 and Bach1 was predicted by starBase and confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay. OGD/R dampened cell viability and miR-194 expression. Bach1 could bind with miR-194. miR-194 mimic attenuated the effect of OGD/R on cell viability and protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1 and Bach1, whereas Bach1 overexpression reversed the effect of miR-194 mimics. MSC-EXs could merge with HBMECs. Based on this, MSC-EXs loaded with miR-194 downregulated Bach1 protein level and iron content and the mRNA expressions of NOX1 and ACSL4, yet upregulated miR-194 and GPX4 expressions and Nrf2/HO-1 protein level in OGD/R-injured cells, whereas those carrying ShmiR-194 had the opposite effects. Our study suggested MSC-EXs loaded with miR-194 attenuated OGD/R-induced injury via targeting Bach1, providing a new therapeutic strategy for cerebral injuries.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is an essential transductor for initiation of many immune responses. Here, we show that lncRNA-ISIR directly binds IRF3 to promote its phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation, along with enhanced target gene productions. In vivo lncRNA-ISIR deficiency results in reduced IFN production, uncontrolled viral replication, and increased mortality. The human homolog, AK131315, also binds IRF3 and promotes its activation. More important, AK131315 expression is positively correlated with type I interferon (IFN-I) level and severity in patients with lupus. Mechanistically, in resting cells, IRF3 is bound to suppressor protein Flightless-1 (Fli-1), which keeps its inactive state. Upon infection, IFN-I-induced lncRNA-ISIR binds IRF3 at DNA-binding domain in cytoplasm and removes Fli-1’s association from IRF3, consequently facilitating IRF3 activation. Our results demonstrate that IFN-I-inducible lncRNA-ISIR feedback strengthens IRF3 activation by removing suppressive Fli-1 in immune responses, revealing a method of lncRNA-mediated modulation of transcription factor (TF) activation.

Abstract: Summary
Protein ADP-ribosylation is a reversible post-translational modification that transfers ADP-ribose from NAD+ onto acceptor proteins. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolases (PARGs), which remove the modification, regulates diverse cellular processes. However, the chemistry and physiological functions of mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation (MARylation) remain elusive. Here, we report that Arabidopsis zinc finger proteins SZF1 and SZF2, key regulators of immune gene expression, are MARylated by the noncanonical ADP-ribosyltransferase SRO2. Immune elicitation promotes MARylation of SZF1/SZF2 via dissociation from PARG1, which has an unconventional activity in hydrolyzing both poly(ADP-ribose) and mono(ADP-ribose) from acceptor proteins. MARylation antagonizes polyubiquitination of SZF1 mediated by the SH3 domain-containing proteins SH3P1/SH3P2, thereby stabilizing SZF1 proteins. Our study uncovers a noncanonical ADP-ribosyltransferase mediating MARylation of immune regulators and underpins the molecular mechanism of maintaining protein homeostasis by the counter-regulation of ADP-ribosylation and polyubiquitination to ensure proper immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome mis-segregation during mitosis leads to aneuploidy, which is a hallmark of cancer and linked to cancer genome evolution. Errors can manifest as “lagging chromosomes” in anaphase, although their mechanistic origins and likelihood of correction are incompletely understood. Here, we combine lattice light-sheet microscopy, endogenous protein labeling, and computational analysis to define the life history of >104 kinetochores. By defining the “laziness” of kinetochores in anaphase, we reveal that chromosomes are at a considerable risk of mis-segregation. We show that the majority of lazy kinetochores are corrected rapidly in anaphase by Aurora B; if uncorrected, they result in a higher rate of micronuclei formation. Quantitative analyses of the kinetochore life histories reveal a dynamic signature of metaphase kinetochore oscillations that forecasts their anaphase fate. We propose that in diploid human cells chromosome segregation is fundamentally error prone, with an additional layer of anaphase error correction required for stable karyotype propagation.

Abstract: Summary
Surface receptors of animal cells, such as integrins, promote mechanosensation by forming clusters as signaling hubs that transduce tensile forces. Walled cells of plants and fungi also feature surface sensors, with long extracellular domains that are embedded in their cell walls (CWs) and are thought to detect injuries and promote repair. How these sensors probe surface forces remains unknown. By studying the conserved CW sensor Wsc1 in fission yeast, we uncovered the formation of micrometer-sized clusters at sites of force application onto the CW. Clusters assembled within minutes of CW compression, in dose dependence with mechanical stress and disassembled upon relaxation. Our data support that Wsc1 accumulates to sites of enhanced mechanical stress through reduced lateral diffusivity, mediated by the binding of its extracellular WSC domain to CW polysaccharides, independent of canonical polarity, trafficking, and downstream CW regulatory pathways. Wsc1 may represent an autonomous module to detect and transduce local surface forces onto the CW.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy that includes subtypes defined by differential expression of ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 (SCLC-A, -N, and -P, respectively). To define the heterogeneity of tumors and their associated microenvironments across subtypes, we sequenced 155,098 transcriptomes from 21 human biospecimens, including 54,523 SCLC transcriptomes. We observe greater tumor diversity in SCLC than lung adenocarcinoma, driven by canonical, intermediate, and admixed subtypes. We discover a PLCG2-high SCLC phenotype with stem-like, pro-metastatic features that recurs across subtypes and predicts worse overall survival. SCLC exhibits greater immune sequestration and less immune infiltration than lung adenocarcinoma, and SCLC-N shows less immune infiltrate and greater T cell dysfunction than SCLC-A. We identify a profibrotic, immunosuppressive monocyte/macrophage population in SCLC tumors that is particularly associated with the recurrent, PLCG2-high subpopulation.

Abstract: Summary
For precise motor control, distinct subpopulations of corticospinal neurons (CSN) must extend axons to distinct spinal segments, from proximal targets in the brainstem and cervical cord to distal targets in thoracic and lumbar spinal segments. We find that developing CSN subpopulations exhibit striking axon targeting specificity in spinal white matter, which establishes the foundation for durable specificity of adult corticospinal circuitry. Employing developmental retrograde and anterograde labeling, and their distinct neocortical locations, we purified developing CSN subpopulations using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to identify genes differentially expressed between bulbar-cervical and thoracolumbar-projecting CSN subpopulations at critical developmental times. These segmentally distinct CSN subpopulations are molecularly distinct from the earliest stages of axon extension, enabling prospective identification even before eventual axon targeting decisions are evident in the spinal cord. This molecular delineation extends beyond simple spatial separation of these subpopulations in the cortex. Together, these results identify candidate molecular controls over segmentally specific corticospinal axon projection targeting.

Abstract: Summary
An ideal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is expected to elicit broad immunity to prevent viral infection and disease, with efficient viral clearance in the upper respiratory tract (URT). Here, the N protein and prefusion-full S protein (SFLmut) are combined with flagellin (KF) and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) to generate a candidate vaccine, and this vaccine elicits stronger systemic and mucosal humoral immunity than vaccines containing other forms of the S protein. Furthermore, the candidate vaccine administered via intranasal route can enhance local immune responses in the respiratory tract. Importantly, human ACE2 transgenic mice given the candidate vaccine are protected against lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with superior protection in the URT compared with that in mice immunized with an inactivated vaccine. In summary, the developed vaccine can elicit a multifaceted immune response and induce robust viral clearance in the URT, which makes it a potential vaccine for preventing disease and infection of SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Summary
In cell transplantation therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI), grafted human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (hiPSC-NS/PCs) mainly differentiate into neurons, forming synapses in a process similar to neurodevelopment. In the developing nervous system, the activity of immature neurons has an important role in constructing and maintaining new synapses. Thus, we investigate how enhancing the activity of transplanted hiPSC-NS/PCs affects both the transplanted cells themselves and the host tissue. We find that chemogenetic stimulation of hiPSC-derived neural cells enhances cell activity and neuron-to-neuron interactions in vitro. In a rodent model of SCI, consecutive and selective chemogenetic stimulation of transplanted hiPSC-NS/PCs also enhances the expression of synapse-related genes and proteins in surrounding host tissues and prevents atrophy of the injured spinal cord, thereby improving locomotor function. These findings provide a strategy for enhancing activity within the graft to improve the efficacy of cell transplantation therapy for SCI.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroblastoma (NB), the most common cancer in the first year of life, presents almost exclusively in the trunk. To understand why an early-onset cancer would have such a specific localization, we xenotransplanted human NB cells into discrete neural crest (NC) streams in zebrafish embryos. Here, we demonstrate that human NB cells remain in an undifferentiated, tumorigenic state when comigrating posteriorly with NC cells but, upon comigration into the head, differentiate into neurons and exhibit decreased survival. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this in vivo differentiation requires retinoic acid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling from the microenvironment, as well as cell-autonomous intersectin-1-dependent phosphoinositide 3-kinase-mediated signaling, likely via Akt kinase activation. Our findings suggest a microenvironment-driven explanation for NB’s trunk-biased localization and highlight the potential for induced differentiation to promote NB resolution in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Signal-mediated regulation of protein trafficking is an elegant mechanism for controlling the delivery of molecules to a precise location for critical signaling events that occur over short time frames. During plant reproduction, the FERONIA receptor complex is critical for intercellular communication that leads to gamete delivery; however, the impact of the FERONIA signal transduction cascade on protein trafficking in synergid cells remains unknown. Live imaging of pollen tube reception has revealed that a key outcome of FERONIA signaling is polar accumulation of the MLO protein NORTIA at the filiform apparatus in response to signals from an arriving pollen tube. Artificial delivery of NORTIA to the filiform apparatus is sufficient to bypass the FERONIA signaling pathway and to promote interspecific pollen tube reception. We propose that polar accumulation of NORTIA leads to the production of a secondary booster signal to ensure that pollen tubes burst to deliver the sperm cells for double fertilization.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) present with sinopulmonary infections, lymphadenopathy, and cytomegalvirus (CMV) and/or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia, yet why patients fail to clear certain chronic viral infections remains incompletely understood. Using patient samples and a mouse model (Pik3cdE1020K/+ mice), we demonstrate that, upon activation, Pik3cdE1020K/+ CD8+ T cells exhibit exaggerated features of effector populations both in vitro and after viral infection that are associated with increased Fas-mediated apoptosis due to sustained FoxO1 phosphorylation and Fasl derepression, enhanced mTORC1 and c-Myc signatures, metabolic perturbations, and an altered chromatin landscape. Conversely, Pik3cdE1020K/+ CD8+ cells fail to sustain expression of proteins critical for central memory, including TCF1. Strikingly, activated Pik3cdE1020K/+ CD8+ cells exhibit altered transcriptional and epigenetic circuits characterized by pronounced interleukin-2 (IL-2)/STAT5 signatures and heightened IL-2 responses that prevent differentiation to memory-like cells in IL-15. Our data position PI3Kδ as integrating multiple signaling nodes that promote CD8+ T cell effector differentiation, providing insight into phenotypes of patients with APDS.

Abstract: Summary
Optical methods for measuring intracellular ions including Ca2+ revolutionized our understanding of signal transduction. However, these methods are not extensively applied to intact organs due to issues including inner filter effects, motion, and available probes. Mitochondrial Ca2+ is postulated to regulate cell energetics and death pathways that are best studied in an intact organ. Here, we develop a method to optically measure mitochondrial Ca2+ and demonstrate its validity for mitochondrial Ca2+ and metabolism using hearts from wild-type mice and mice with germline knockout of the mitochondria calcium uniporter (MCU-KO). We previously reported that germline MCU-KO hearts do not show an impaired response to adrenergic stimulation. We find that these MCU-KO hearts do not take up Ca2+, consistent with no alternative Ca2+ uptake mechanisms in the absence of MCU. This approach can address the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ to the myriad of functions attributed to alterations in mitochondrial Ca2+.

Abstract: Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor extensively used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins and a component of liquid and food containers. It is a hazard in the prenatal period because of its presence in the placenta, fetal membranes, amniotic fluid, maternal and fetal blood and its ability to cross the placenta and reach the fetus. Estimation of the risk of BPA exposure during in utero life is extremely important in order to prevent complications of pregnancy and fetal growth. This review describes in vitro models of the human materno-fetal interface. It also outlines the effects of BPA at doses indicated as “physiological”, namely at the concentrations found in the general population, and at “supraphysiological” and “subphysiological” doses, i.e. above and below the physiological range. This work will help clarify the discrepancies observed in studies on the effects of BPA on human reproduction and pregnancy, and it will be useful for the choice of appropriate in vitro models for future studies aimed at identifying the potential impact of BPA on specific functional processes.

Abstract: Summary
Young adult cancer has increased in incidence worldwide, but its molecular etiologies remain unclear. We systematically characterize genomic profiles of young adult tumors with ages of onset ≤50 years and compare them to later-onset tumors using over 6,000 cases across 14 cancer types. While young adult tumors generally show lower mutation burdens and comparable copy-number variation rates compared to later-onset cases, they are enriched for multiple driver mutations and copy-number alterations in subtype-specific contexts. Characterization of tumor immune microenvironments reveals pan-cancer patterns of elevated TGF-β response/dendritic cells and lower IFN-γ response/macrophages relative to later-onset tumors, corresponding to age-related responses to immunotherapy in several cancer types. Finally, we identify prevalent clinically actionable events that disproportionally affect young adult or later-onset cases. The resulting catalog of age-related molecular drivers can guide precision diagnostics and treatments for young adult cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Early embryogenesis depends on proper control of intracellular homeostasis of ions including Ca2+ and Mg2+. Deletion of the Ca2+ and Mg2+ conducting the TRPM7 channel is embryonically lethal in mice but leaves compaction, blastomere polarization, blastocoel formation, and correct specification of the lineages of the trophectoderm and inner cell mass unaltered despite that free cytoplasmic Ca2+ and Mg2+ is reduced at the two-cell stage. Although Trpm7−/− embryos are able to hatch from the zona pellucida, no expansion of Trpm7−/− trophoblast cells can be observed, and Trpm7−/− embryos are not identifiable in utero at E6.5 or later. Given the proliferation and adhesion defect of Trpm7−/− trophoblast stem cells and the ability of Trpm7−/− ESCs to develop to embryos in tetraploid embryo complementation assays, we postulate a critical role of TRPM7 in trophectoderm cells and their failure during implantation as the most likely explanation of the developmental arrest of Trpm7-deficient mouse embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a commonly inherited form of autism and intellectual disability, is associated with emotional symptoms that implicate dysfunction of the amygdala. However, current understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is based primarily on studies in the hippocampus and neocortex, where FXS defects have been corrected by inhibiting group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Here, we observe that activation, rather than inhibition, of mGluRs in the basolateral amygdala reverses impairments in a rat model of FXS. FXS rats exhibit deficient recall of auditory conditioned fear, which is accompanied by a range of in vitro and in vivo deficits in synaptic transmission and plasticity. We find presynaptic mGluR5 in the amygdala, activation of which reverses deficient synaptic transmission and plasticity, thereby restoring normal fear learning in FXS rats. This highlights the importance of modifying the prevailing mGluR-based framework for therapeutic strategies to include circuit-specific differences in FXS pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanistic insights into the role of the human microbiome in the predisposition to and treatment of disease are limited by the lack of methods to precisely add or remove microbial strains or genes from complex communities. Here, we demonstrate that engineered bacteriophage M13 can be used to deliver DNA to Escherichia coli within the mouse gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Delivery of a programmable exogenous CRISPR-Cas9 system enables the strain-specific depletion of fluorescently marked isogenic strains during competitive colonization and genomic deletions that encompass the target gene in mice colonized with a single strain. Multiple mechanisms allow E. coli to escape targeting, including loss of the CRISPR array or even the entire CRISPR-Cas9 system. These results provide a robust and experimentally tractable platform for microbiome editing, a foundation for the refinement of this approach to increase targeting efficiency, and a proof of concept for the extension to other phage-bacterial pairs of interest.

Abstract: Summary
Human biomedical datasets that are critical for research and clinical studies to benefit human health also often contain sensitive or potentially identifying information of individual participants. Thus, care must be taken when they are processed and made available to comply with ethical and regulatory frameworks and informed consent data conditions. To enable and streamline data access for these biomedical datasets, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Data Use and Researcher Identities (DURI) work stream developed and approved the Data Use Ontology (DUO) standard. DUO is a hierarchical vocabulary of human and machine-readable data use terms that consistently and unambiguously represents a dataset’s allowable data uses. DUO has been implemented by major international stakeholders such as the Broad and Sanger Institutes and is currently used in annotation of over 200,000 datasets worldwide. Using DUO in data management and access facilitates researchers’ discovery and access of relevant datasets. DUO annotations increase the FAIRness of datasets and support data linkages using common data use profiles when integrating the data for secondary analyses. DUO is implemented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and, to increase community awareness and engagement, hosted in an open, centralized GitHub repository. DUO, together with the GA4GH Passport standard, offers a new, efficient, and streamlined data authorization and access framework that has enabled increased sharing of biomedical datasets worldwide.

Abstract: Summary
Spt4 is a transcription elongation factor with homologs in organisms with nucleosomes. Structural and in vitro studies implicate Spt4 in transcription through nucleosomes, and yet the in vivo function of Spt4 is unclear. Here, we assess the precise position of Spt4 during transcription and the consequences of the loss of Spt4 on RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) dynamics and nucleosome positioning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the absence of Spt4, the spacing between gene-body nucleosomes increases and RNAPII accumulates upstream of the nucleosomal dyad, most dramatically at nucleosome +2. Spt4 associates with elongating RNAPII early in transcription, and its association dynamically changes depending on nucleosome positions. Together, our data show that Spt4 regulates early elongation dynamics, participates in co-transcriptional nucleosome positioning, and promotes RNAPII movement through the gene-body nucleosomes, especially the +2 nucleosome.

Abstract: Summary
Suppressive regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation is controlled by diverse immunometabolic signaling pathways and intracellular metabolites. Here we show that cell-permeable α-ketoglutarate (αKG) alters the DNA methylation profile of naive CD4 T cells activated under Treg polarizing conditions, markedly attenuating FoxP3+ Treg differentiation and increasing inflammatory cytokines. Adoptive transfer of these T cells into tumor-bearing mice results in enhanced tumor infiltration, decreased FoxP3 expression, and delayed tumor growth. Mechanistically, αKG leads to an energetic state that is reprogrammed toward a mitochondrial metabolism, with increased oxidative phosphorylation and expression of mitochondrial complex enzymes. Furthermore, carbons from ectopic αKG are directly utilized in the generation of fatty acids, associated with lipidome remodeling and increased triacylglyceride stores. Notably, inhibition of either mitochondrial complex II or DGAT2-mediated triacylglyceride synthesis restores Treg differentiation and decreases the αKG-induced inflammatory phenotype. Thus, we identify a crosstalk between αKG, mitochondrial metabolism and triacylglyceride synthesis that controls Treg fate.

Abstract: Summary
The existence of a dysfunctional CD8+ T cell state in cancer is well established. However, the degree to which CD8+ T cell fates are influenced by the context in which they encounter cognate tumor antigen is less clear. We previously demonstrated that CD8+ T cells reactive to a model leukemia antigen were deleted by antigen cross-presenting type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s). Here, through a study of T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic CD8+ T cells (TCRTg101) reactive to a native C1498 leukemia cell antigen, we uncover a different mode of T cell tolerance in which TCRTg101 undergo progressive expansion and differentiation into an exhausted state. Antigen encounter by TCRTg101 requires leukemia cell major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I expression and is independent of DCs, implying that leukemia cells directly mediate the exhausted TCRTg101 phenotype. Collectively, our data reveal that leukemia antigens are presented to CD8+ T cells via discrete pathways, leading to distinct tolerant states.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is associated with several blinding retinal diseases. Using proteomics and phosphoproteomics studies of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE monolayers with induced EMT, we capture kinase/phosphatase signaling cascades 1 h and 12 h after induction to better understand the pathways mediating RPE EMT. Induction by co-treatment with transforming growth factor β and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TGNF) or enzymatic dissociation perturbs signaling in many of the same pathways, with striking similarity in the respective phosphoproteomes at 1 h. Liver hyperplasia and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-MET signaling exhibit the highest overall enrichment. We also observe that HGF and epidermal growth factor signaling, two cooperative pathways inhibited by EMT induction, regulate the RPE transcriptional profile.

Abstract: Summary
Fetal growth restriction (FGR) increases the risk for impaired cognitive function later in life. However, the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Using dexamethasone-induced FGR and protein restriction-influenced FGR mouse models, we observe learning and memory deficits in adult FGR offspring. FGR induces decreased hippocampal neurogenesis from the early post-natal period to adulthood by reducing the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs). We further find a persistent decrease of Tet1 expression in hippocampal NSCs of FGR mice. Mechanistically, Tet1 downregulation results in hypermethylation of the Dll3 and Notch1 promoters and inhibition of Notch signaling, leading to reduced NSC proliferation. Overexpression of Tet1 activates Notch signaling, offsets the decline in neurogenesis, and enhances learning and memory abilities in FGR offspring. Our data indicate that a long-term decrease in Tet1/Notch signaling in hippocampal NSCs contributes to impaired neurogenesis following FGR and could serve as potential targets for the intervention of FGR-related cognitive disorders.

Abstract: Summary
In emergency myelopoiesis (EM), expansion of the myeloid progenitor compartment and increased myeloid cell production are observed and often mediated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-γ). Interleukin-10 (IL-10) inhibits IFN-γ secretion, but paradoxically, its therapeutic administration to humans causes hematologic changes similar to those observed in EM. In this work, we use different in vivo systems, including a humanized immune system mouse model, to show that IL-10 triggers EM, with a significant expansion of the myeloid progenitor compartment and production of myeloid cells. Hematopoietic progenitors display a prominent IFN-γ transcriptional signature, and we show that IFN-γ mediates IL-10-driven EM. We also find that IL-10, unexpectedly, reprograms CD4 and CD8 T cells toward an activation state that includes IFN-γ production by these T cell subsets in vivo. Therefore, in addition to its established anti-inflammatory properties, IL-10 can induce IFN-γ production and EM, opening additional perspectives for the design of IL-10-based immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) results from a complex interplay of damage to the sensory cells of the inner ear, dysfunction of its lateral wall, axonal retraction of type 1C spiral ganglion neurons, and activation of the immune response. We use RiboTag and single-cell RNA sequencing to survey the cell-type-specific molecular landscape of the mouse inner ear before and after noise trauma. We identify induction of the transcription factors STAT3 and IRF7 and immune-related genes across all cell-types. Yet, cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes dominate the response. The ATF3/ATF4 stress-response pathway is robustly induced in the type 1A noise-resilient neurons, potassium transport genes are downregulated in the lateral wall, mRNA metabolism genes are downregulated in outer hair cells, and deafness-associated genes are downregulated in most cell types. This transcriptomic resource is available via the Gene Expression Analysis Resource (gEAR; https://umgear.org/NIHL) and provides a blueprint for the rational development of drugs to prevent and treat NIHL.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose metabolism modulates the islet β cell responses to diabetogenic stress, including inflammation. Here, we probed the metabolic mechanisms that underlie the protective effect of glucose in inflammation by interrogating the metabolite profiles of primary islets from human donors and identified de novo glutathione synthesis as a prominent glucose-driven pro-survival pathway. We find that pyruvate carboxylase is required for glutathione synthesis in islets and promotes their antioxidant capacity to counter inflammation and nitrosative stress. Loss- and gain-of-function studies indicate that pyruvate carboxylase is necessary and sufficient to mediate the metabolic input from glucose into glutathione synthesis and the oxidative stress response. Altered redox metabolism and cellular capacity to replenish glutathione pools are relevant in multiple pathologies beyond obesity and diabetes. Our findings reveal a direct interplay between glucose metabolism and glutathione biosynthesis via pyruvate carboxylase. This metabolic axis may also have implications in other settings where sustaining glutathione is essential.

Abstract: Summary
In animals, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons, fight viral infections, and regulate gene expression. piRNA biogenesis concludes with 3′ terminal trimming and 2′-O-methylation. Both trimming and methylation influence piRNA stability. Our biochemical data show that multiple mechanisms destabilize unmethylated mouse piRNAs, depending on whether the piRNA 5′ or 3′ sequence is complementary to a trigger RNA. Unlike target-directed degradation of microRNAs, complementarity-dependent destabilization of piRNAs in mice and flies is blocked by 3′ terminal 2′-O-methylation and does not require base pairing to both the piRNA seed and the 3′ sequence. In flies, 2′-O-methylation also protects small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from complementarity-dependent destruction. By contrast, pre-piRNA trimming protects mouse piRNAs from a degradation pathway unaffected by trigger complementarity. In testis lysate and in vivo, internal or 3′ terminal uridine- or guanine-rich tracts accelerate pre-piRNA decay. Loss of both trimming and 2′-O-methylation causes the mouse piRNA pathway to collapse, demonstrating that these modifications collaborate to stabilize piRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are designed to learn sequential patterns in silico, but it is unclear whether and how an RNN forms in the native networks of the mammalian brain. Here, we report an innate RNN, which is formed by the unidirectional connections from three basic units: input units arriving from emotion regions, a hidden unit in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and output units located at the somatic motor cortex (sMO). Specifically, the neurons from basal lateral amygdala (BLA) and the insular cortex (IC) project to the mPFC motor-cortex-projecting (MP) neurons. These MP neurons form a local self-feedback loop and target major projecting neurons of the sMO. Within the sMO, the neurons in the infragranular layers receive stronger input than the neurons in supragranular layers. Finally, we show in vivo evidence that the communications from the emotion regions to the sMO are abolished when MP neurons are chemogenetically silenced.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity is tightly regulated by cellular redox status, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Protein S-nitrosylation, the nitric-oxide-mediated cysteine thiol protein modification, plays important roles in cellular redox regulation. Here we show that diet-induced obesity (DIO) and acute cold exposure elevate BAT protein S-nitrosylation, including UCP1. This thermogenic-induced nitric oxide bioactivity is regulated by S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR; alcohol dehydrogenase 5 [ADH5]), a denitrosylase that balances the intracellular nitroso-redox status. Loss of ADH5 in BAT impairs cold-induced UCP1-dependent thermogenesis and worsens obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Adh5 expression is induced by the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), and administration of an HSF1 activator to BAT of DIO mice increases Adh5 expression and significantly improves UCP1-mediated respiration. Together, these data indicate that ADH5 controls BAT nitroso-redox homeostasis to regulate adipose thermogenesis, which may be therapeutically targeted to improve metabolic health.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebellar outputs take polysynaptic routes to reach the rest of the brain, impeding conventional tracing. Here, we quantify pathways between the cerebellum and forebrain by using transsynaptic tracing viruses and a whole-brain analysis pipeline. With retrograde tracing, we find that most descending paths originate from the somatomotor cortex. Anterograde tracing of ascending paths encompasses most thalamic nuclei, especially ventral posteromedial, lateral posterior, mediodorsal, and reticular nuclei. In the neocortex, sensorimotor regions contain the most labeled neurons, but we find higher densities in associative areas, including orbital, anterior cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortex. Patterns of ascending expression correlate with c-Fos expression after optogenetic inhibition of Purkinje cells. Our results reveal homologous networks linking single areas of the cerebellar cortex to diverse forebrain targets. We conclude that shared areas of the cerebellum are positioned to provide sensory-motor information to regions implicated in both movement and nonmotor function.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated circulating activity of adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) is associated with liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In the liver of NAFLD patients, ADA2-positive portal macrophages are significantly associated with the degree of liver fibrosis. These liver macrophages are CD14- and CD16-positive and co-express chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR3, indicating infiltrative monocyte origin. Human circulatory monocytes release ADA2 upon macrophage differentiation in vitro. When stimulated by recombinant human ADA2 (rhADA2), human monocyte-derived macrophages demonstrate upregulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes, including PDGF-B, a key pro-fibrotic cytokine. This PDGF-B upregulation is reproduced by inosine, the enzymatic product of ADA2, but not adenosine, and is abolished by E359N, a loss-of-function mutation in ADA2. Finally, rhADA2 also stimulates PDGF-B production from Kupffer cells in primary human liver spheroids. Together, these data suggest that infiltrative monocytes promote fibrogenesis in NAFLD via ADA2-mediated autocrine/paracrine signaling culminating in enhanced PDGF-B production.

Abstract: Summary
Gut microbial diversity decreases with aging, but existing studies have used stool samples, which do not represent the entire gut. We analyzed the duodenal microbiome in 251 subjects aged 18–35 (n = 32), 36–50 (n = 41), 51–65 (n = 96), and 66–80 (n = 82). Decreased duodenal microbial diversity in older subjects is associated with combinations of chronological age, number of concomitant diseases, and number of medications used, and also correlated with increasing coliform numbers (p < 0.0001). Relative abundance (RA) of phylum Proteobacteria increases in older subjects, with increased RA of family Enterobacteriaceae and coliform genera Escherichia and Klebsiella, and is associated with alterations in the RA of other duodenal microbial taxa and decreased microbial diversity. Increased RA of specific genera are associated with chronological age only (Escherichia, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus), number of medications only (Klebsiella), or number of concomitant diseases only (Clostridium and Bilophila). These findings indicate the small intestinal microbiome changes significantly with age and the aging process.

Abstract: Summary
Although both infections and vaccines induce memory B cell (MBC) populations that participate in secondary immune responses, the MBCs generated in each case can differ. Here, we compare SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (S1-RBD)-specific primary MBCs that form in response to infection or a single mRNA vaccination. Both primary MBC populations have similar frequencies in the blood and respond to a second S1-RBD exposure by rapidly producing plasmablasts with an abundant immunoglobulin (Ig)A+ subset and secondary MBCs that are mostly IgG+ and cross-react with the B.1.351 variant. However, infection-induced primary MBCs have better antigen-binding capacity and generate more plasmablasts and secondary MBCs of the classical and atypical subsets than do vaccine-induced primary MBCs. Our results suggest that infection-induced primary MBCs have undergone more affinity maturation than vaccine-induced primary MBCs and produce more robust secondary responses.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired synaptic neurotransmission may underly circuit alterations contributing to behavioral autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotypes. A critical component of impairments reported in somatosensory and prefrontal cortex of ASD mouse models are parvalbumin (PV)-expressing fast-spiking interneurons. However, it remains unknown whether PV interneurons mediating hippocampal networks crucial to navigation and memory processing are similarly impaired. Using PV-labeled transgenic mice, a battery of behavioral assays, in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology, and in vivo 32-channel silicon probe local field potential recordings, we address this question in a Cntnap2-null mutant mouse model representing a human ASD risk factor gene. Cntnap2−/− mice show a reduction in hippocampal PV interneuron density, reduced inhibitory input to CA1 pyramidal cells, deficits in spatial discrimination ability, and frequency-dependent circuit changes within the hippocampus, including alterations in gamma oscillations, sharp-wave ripples, and theta-gamma modulation. Our findings highlight hippocampal involvement in ASD and implicate interneurons as a potential therapeutical target.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment. Diet, as a modifiable risk factor for AD, could potentially be targeted to slow disease onset and progression. However, complexity of the human diet and indirect effects of the microbiome make it challenging to identify protective nutrients. Multiple factors contribute to AD pathogenesis, including amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, energy crisis, and oxidative stress. Here, we use Caenorhabditis elegans to define the impact of diet on Aβ proteotoxicity. We discover that dietary vitamin B12 alleviates mitochondrial fragmentation, bioenergetic defects, and oxidative stress, delaying Aβ-induced paralysis without affecting Aβ accumulation. Vitamin B12 has this protective effect by acting as a cofactor for methionine synthase, impacting the methionine/S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) cycle. Vitamin B12 supplementation of B12-deficient adult Aβ animals is beneficial, demonstrating potential for vitamin B12 as a therapy to target pathogenic features of AD triggered by proteotoxic stress.

Abstract: Summary
Microdroplet single-cell ATAC-seq is widely used to measure chromatin accessibility, however, highly scalable and simple sample multiplexing procedures are not available. Here, we present a transposome-assisted single nucleus barcoding approach for ATAC-seq (SNuBar-ATAC) that utilizes a single oligonucleotide adaptor for multiplexing samples during the existing tagmentation step and does not require a pre-labeling procedure. The accuracy and scalability of SNuBar-ATAC was evaluated using cell line mixture experiments. We applied SNuBar-ATAC to investigate treatment-induced chromatin accessibility dynamics by multiplexing 28 mice with lung tumors that received different combinations of chemo, radiation, and targeted immunotherapy. We also applied SNuBar-ATAC to study spatial epigenetic heterogeneity by multiplexing 32 regions from a human breast tissue.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are of interest as a new vector for the delivery of therapeutic agents into the tumor microenvironment. Cell-free EV-based therapy has a number of advantages over cell-based therapy, since the use of EVs allows avoiding potential undesirable transformation associated with MSCs. MSC-derived EVs can transfer natural proteins with immunomodulatory or antitumor properties. The aim of this study was to produce vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells with simultaneous overexpression of TRAIL, PTEN and IFN-β1 and analyze its antitumor and immunomodulatory properties. In this work, a stable line of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) with simultaneous overexpression of TRAIL, PTEN and IFN-β1 was produced. To obtain this cell line hADSCs were genetically modified with a genetic multicistronic cassette encoding TRAIL, PTEN, and IFN-β1 genes separated with a self-cleaving P2A peptide nucleotide sequence. Membrane vesicles (CIMVs) were obtained from genetically modified hADSCs using cytochalasin B treatment. Antitumor and immunomodulatory properties of the CIMVs were analyzed in vitro. It was shown that CIMVs isolated from genetically modified hADSCs overexpressing TRAIL, PTEN and IFN-β1 genes are able to activate human immune cells and induce apoptosis in various types of carcinomas in vitro. Thus, the immunomodulatory and antitumor properties of CIMVs were shown. However, further studies on animal models in vivo are required.

Abstract: The rapid increase in collateral omics and phenotypic data has enabled data-driven studies for the fast discovery of cancer targets and biomarkers. Thus, it is necessary to develop convenient tools for general oncologists and cancer scientists to carry out customized data mining without computational expertise. For this purpose, we developed innovative software that enables user-driven analyses assisted by knowledge-based smart systems. Publicly available data on mutations, gene expression, patient survival, immune score, drug screening and RNAi screening were integrated from the TCGA, GDSC, CCLE, NCI, and DepMap databases. The optimal selection of samples and other filtering options were guided by the smart function of the software for data mining and visualization on Kaplan-Meier plots, box plots and scatter plots of publication quality. We implemented unique algorithms for both data mining and visualization, thus simplifying and accelerating user-driven discovery activities on large multiomics datasets. The present Q-omics software program (v0.95) is available at http://qomics.sookmyung.ac.kr.

Abstract: Summary
T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation involve metabolic reprogramming resulting from the interplay of genes, proteins, and metabolites. Here, we aim to understand the metabolic pathways involved in the activation and functional differentiation of human CD4+ T cell subsets (T helper [Th]1, Th2, Th17, and induced regulatory T [iTreg] cells). Here, we combine genome-scale metabolic modeling, gene expression data, and targeted and non-targeted lipidomics experiments, together with in vitro gene knockdown experiments, and show that human CD4+ T cells undergo specific metabolic changes during activation and functional differentiation. In addition, we confirm the importance of ceramide and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis pathways in Th17 differentiation and effector functions. Through in vitro gene knockdown experiments, we substantiate the requirement of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), a de novo sphingolipid pathway in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-17A and IL17F) by Th17 cells. Our findings provide a comprehensive resource for selective manipulation of CD4+ T cells under disease conditions characterized by an imbalance of Th17/natural Treg (nTreg) cells.

Abstract: Summary
Robust alternative end joining (A-EJ) in classical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ)-deficient murine cells features double-strand break (DSB) end resection and microhomology (MH) usage and promotes chromosomal translocation. The activities responsible for removing 3′ single-strand overhangs following resection and MH annealing in A-EJ remain unclear. We show that, during class switch recombination (CSR) in mature mouse B cells, the structure-specific endonuclease complex XPF-ERCC1SLX4, although not required for normal CSR, represents a nucleotide-excision-repair-independent 3′ flap removal activity for A-EJ-mediated CSR. B cells deficient in DNA ligase 4 and XPF-ERCC1 exhibit further impaired class switching, reducing joining to the resected S region DSBs without altering the MH pattern in S-S junctions. In ERCC1-deficient A-EJ cells, 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) flaps that are generated predominantly in S/G2 phase of the cell cycle are susceptible to nuclease resolution. Moreover, ERCC1 promotes c-myc-IgH translocation in Lig4−/− cells. Our study reveals an important role of the flap endonuclease XPF-ERCC1 in A-EJ and oncogenic translocation in mouse B cells.

Abstract: Histopathological images are widely used to diagnose diseases including skin cancer. As digital histopathological images are typically of very large size, in the order of several billion pixels, automated identification of all abnormal cell nuclei and their distribution within multiple tissue sections would assist rapid comprehensive diagnostic assessment. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based technique to segment the melanoma regions in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained histopathological images. In this technique, the nuclei in the image are first segmented using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The segmented nuclei are then used to generate melanoma region masks. Experimental results with a small melanoma dataset show that the proposed method can potentially segment the nuclei with more than 94 % accuracy and segment the melanoma regions with a Dice coefficient of around 85 %. The proposed technique also has a small execution time making it suitable for clinical diagnosis with a fast turnaround time.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the worldwide effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the underlying mechanisms of fatal viral pneumonia remain elusive. Here, we show that critical COVID-19 is associated with enhanced eosinophil-mediated inflammation when compared to non-critical cases. In addition, we confirm increased T helper (Th)2-biased adaptive immune responses, accompanying overt complement activation, in the critical group. Moreover, enhanced antibody responses and complement activation are associated with disease pathogenesis as evidenced by formation of immune complexes and membrane attack complexes in airways and vasculature of lung biopsies from six fatal cases, as well as by enhanced hallmark gene set signatures of Fcγ receptor (FcγR) signaling and complement activation in myeloid cells of respiratory specimens from critical COVID-19 patients. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may drive specific innate immune responses, including eosinophil-mediated inflammation, and subsequent pulmonary pathogenesis via enhanced Th2-biased immune responses, which might be crucial drivers of critical disease in COVID-19 patients.

Abstract: Summary
Sertoli cells are highly polarized testicular supporting cells that simultaneously nurture multiple stages of germ cells during spermatogenesis. Proper localization of polarity protein complexes within Sertoli cells, including those responsible for blood-testis barrier formation, is vital for spermatogenesis. However, the mechanisms and developmental timing that underlie Sertoli cell polarity are poorly understood. We investigate this aspect of testicular function by conditionally deleting Cdc42, encoding a Rho GTPase involved in regulating cell polarity, specifically in Sertoli cells. Sertoli Cdc42 deletion leads to increased apoptosis and disrupted polarity of juvenile and adult testes but does not affect fetal and postnatal testicular development. The onset of the first wave of spermatogenesis occurs normally, but it fails to progress past round spermatid stages, and by young adulthood, conditional knockout males exhibit a complete loss of spermatogenic cells. These findings demonstrate that Cdc42 is essential for Sertoli cell polarity and for maintaining steady-state sperm production.

Abstract: Summary
The global impact of somatic structural variants (SVs) on gene regulation in advanced tumors with complex treatment histories has been mostly uncharacterized. Here, using whole-genome and RNA sequencing from 570 recurrent or metastatic tumors, we report the altered expression of hundreds of genes in association with nearby SV breakpoints, including oncogenes and G-protein-coupled receptor-related genes such as PLEKHG2. A significant fraction of genes with SV-expression associations correlate with worse patient survival in primary and advanced cancers, including SRD5A1. In many instances, SV-expression associations involve retrotransposons being translocated near genes. High overall SV burden is associated with treatment with DNA alkylating agents or taxanes and altered expression of metabolism-associated genes. SV-expression associations within tumors from topoisomerase I inhibitor-treated patients include chromatin-related genes. Within anthracycline-treated tumors, SV breakpoints near chromosome 1p genes include PDE4B. Patient treatment and history can help understand the widespread SV-mediated cis-regulatory alterations found in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Bone metastases are devastating complications of cancer. They are particularly common in prostate cancer (PCa), represent incurable disease, and are refractory to immunotherapy. We seek to define distinct features of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment by analyzing single cells from bone metastatic prostate tumors, involved BM, uninvolved BM, and BM from cancer-free, orthopedic patients, and healthy individuals. Metastatic PCa is associated with multifaceted immune distortion, specifically exhaustion of distinct T cell subsets, appearance of macrophages with states specific to PCa bone metastases. The chemokine CCL20 is notably overexpressed by myeloid cells, as is its cognate CCR6 receptor on T cells. Disruption of the CCL20-CCR6 axis in mice with syngeneic PCa bone metastases restores T cell reactivity and significantly prolongs animal survival. Comparative high-resolution analysis of PCa bone metastases shows a targeted approach for relieving local immunosuppression for therapeutic effect.

Abstract: Summary
Histone H3.3 lysine-to-methionine substitutions K27M and K36M impair the deposition of opposing chromatin marks, H3K27me3/me2 and H3K36me3/me2. We show that these mutations induce hypotrophic and disorganized eyes in Drosophila eye primordia. Restriction of H3K27me3 spread in H3.3K27M and its redistribution in H3.3K36M result in transcriptional deregulation of PRC2-targeted eye development and of piRNA biogenesis genes, including krimp. Notably, both mutants promote redistribution of H3K36me2 away from repetitive regions into active genes, which associate with retrotransposon de-repression in eye discs. Aberrant expression of krimp represses LINE retrotransposons but does not contribute to the eye phenotype. Depletion of H3K36me2 methyltransferase ash1 in H3.3K27M, and of PRC2 component E(z) in H3.3K36M, restores the expression of eye developmental genes and normal eye growth, showing that redistribution of antagonistic marks contributes to K-to-M pathogenesis. Our results implicate a novel function for H3K36me2 and showcase convergent downstream effects of oncohistones that target opposing epigenetic marks.

Abstract: Chitosan, a deacetylated form of chitin, is required for the virulence of Cryptococcus neoformans. There are three chitin deacetylase genes (CDA) that are essential for chitosan production, and deletion of all three genes results in the absence of chitosan, loss of virulence, and induction of a protective host response when used as a vaccine. Cda1 plays a major role in deacetylating chitin during pulmonary infection of CBA/J mice. Inoculation with the cda1Δ strain did not lead to a lethal infection. However, the infection was not cleared. The persistence of the fungus in the host suggests that chitin is still being deacetylated by Cda2 and/or Cda3. To test this hypothesis, we subjected strains deleted of two CDA genes to fungal virulence in CBA/J, C57BL/6 and BALB/c and found that cda1Δcda2Δ was avirulent in all mouse lines, as evidenced by its complete clearance. Consistent with the major role of Cda1 in CBA/J, we found that cda2Δcda3Δ was as virulent as its wild-type progenitor KN99. On the other hand, cda1Δcda3Δ displayed virulence comparable to that of cda1Δ. The virulence of each mutant correlates with the amount of chitosan produced when grown under host-mimicking culture conditions. In addition, the avirulence of cda1Δcda2Δ was followed by the induction of a protective immune response in C57BL/6 and CBA/J mice, when a live or heat-killed form of the mutant was used as a vaccine respectively. Taken together, these data imply that, in C. neoformans, coordinated activity of both Cda1 and Cda2 is essential for mediating fungal virulence.

Abstract: Summary
NAD+ is an essential coenzyme for all living cells. NAD+ concentrations decline with age, but whether this reflects impaired production or accelerated consumption remains unclear. We employed isotope tracing and mass spectrometry to probe age-related changes in NAD+ metabolism across tissues. In aged mice, we observed modest tissue NAD+ depletion (median decrease ∼30%). Circulating NAD+ precursors were not significantly changed, and isotope tracing showed the unimpaired synthesis of nicotinamide from tryptophan. In most tissues of aged mice, turnover of the smaller tissue NAD+ pool was modestly faster such that absolute NAD+ biosynthetic flux was maintained, consistent with more active NAD+-consuming enzymes. Calorie restriction partially mitigated age-associated NAD+ decline by decreasing consumption. Acute inflammatory stress induced by LPS decreased NAD+ by impairing synthesis in both young and aged mice. Thus, the decline in NAD+ with normal aging is relatively subtle and occurs despite maintained NAD+ production, likely due to increased consumption.

Abstract: Summary
TBK1 is an essential kinase for the innate immune response against viral infection. However, the key molecular mechanisms regulating the TBK1 activation remain elusive. Here, we identify PRMT1, a type I protein arginine methyltransferase, as an essential regulator of TBK1 activation. PRMT1 directly interacts with TBK1 and catalyzes asymmetric methylation of R54, R134, and R228 on TBK1. This modification enhances TBK1 oligomerization after viral infection, which subsequently promotes TBK1 phosphorylation and downstream type I interferon production. More important, myeloid-specific Prmt1 knockout mice are more susceptible to infection with DNA and RNA viruses than Prmt1fl/fl mice. Our findings reveal insights into the molecular regulation of TBK1 activation and demonstrate the essential function of protein arginine methylation in innate antiviral immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Individual hosts within populations often show inter-individual variation in their susceptibility to bacterial pathogen-related diseases. Utilizing Drosophila, we highlight that phenotypic variation in host-pathogen susceptibility within populations is driven by energetic trade-offs, facilitated by infection-mediated changes in glutamate metabolism. Furthermore, host-pathogen susceptibility is conditioned by life history, which adjusts immunometabolic sensing in muscles to direct vitamin-dependent reallocation of host energy substrates from the adipose tissue (i.e., a muscle-adipose tissue axis). Life history conditions inter-individual variation in the activation strength of intra-muscular NF-κB signaling. Limited intra-muscular NF-κB signaling activity allows for enhanced infection-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and function, which stimulates glutamate dehydrogenase-dependent synthesis of glutamate. Muscle-derived glutamate acts as a systemic metabolite to promote lipid mobilization through modulating vitamin B enzymatic cofactor transport and function in the adipose tissue. This energy substrate reallocation improves pathogen clearance and boosts host survival. Finally, life history events that adjust energetic trade-offs can shape inter-individual variation in host-pathogen susceptibility after infection.
