Abstract: Summary
Despite its low cellular abundance, phosphotyrosine (pTyr) regulates numerous cell signaling pathways in health and disease. We applied comprehensive phosphoproteomics to unravel differential regulators of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-initiated signaling networks upon activation by Pdgf-ββ, Fgf-2, or Igf-1 and identified more than 40,000 phosphorylation sites, including many phosphotyrosine sites without additional enrichment. The analysis revealed RTK-specific regulation of hundreds of pTyr sites on key signaling molecules. We found the tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 to be the master regulator of Pdgfr pTyr signaling. Application of a recently introduced allosteric Shp-2 inhibitor revealed global regulation of the Pdgf-dependent tyrosine phosphoproteome, which significantly impaired cell migration. In addition, we present a list of hundreds of Shp-2-dependent targets and putative substrates, including Rasa1 and Cortactin with increased pTyr and Gab1 and Erk1/2 with decreased pTyr. Our study demonstrates that large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics can precisely dissect tightly regulated kinase-phosphatase signaling networks.

Abstract: Summary
Beige and brown adipocytes generate heat in response to reductions in ambient temperature. When warmed, both beige and brown adipocytes exhibit morphological “whitening,” but it is unknown whether or to what extent this represents a true shift in cellular identity. Using cell-type-specific profiling in vivo, we uncover a unique paradigm of temperature-dependent epigenomic plasticity of beige, but not brown, adipocytes, with conversion from a brown to a white chromatin state. Despite this profound shift in cellular identity, warm whitened beige adipocytes retain an epigenomic memory of prior cold exposure defined by an array of poised enhancers that prime thermogenic genes for rapid response during a second bout of cold exposure. We further show that a transcriptional cascade involving glucocorticoid receptor and Zfp423 can drive warm-induced whitening of beige adipocytes. These studies identify the epigenomic and transcriptional bases of an extraordinary example of cellular plasticity in response to environmental signals.

Abstract: Summary
We have performed an in-depth single-cell phenotypic characterization of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) by multiparametric mass cytometry (CyTOF). Using a CyTOF antibody panel to interrogate features of HGSOC biology, combined with unsupervised computational analysis, we identified noteworthy cell types co-occurring across the tumors. In addition to a dominant cell subset, each tumor harbored rarer cell phenotypes. One such group co-expressed E-cadherin and vimentin (EV), suggesting their potential role in epithelial mesenchymal transition, which was substantiated by pairwise correlation analyses. Furthermore, tumors from patients with poorer outcome had an increased frequency of another rare cell type that co-expressed vimentin, HE4, and cMyc. These poorer-outcome tumors also populated more cell phenotypes, as quantified by Simpson’s diversity index. Thus, despite the recognized genomic complexity of the disease, the specific cell phenotypes uncovered here offer a focus for therapeutic intervention and disease monitoring.

Abstract: Summary
Reduced eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 (eIF2)α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α) enhances protein synthesis, memory formation, and addiction-like behaviors. However, p-eIF2α has not been examined with regard to psychoactive cannabinoids and cross-sensitization. Here, we find that a cannabinoid receptor agonist (WIN 55,212-2 mesylate [WIN]) reduced p-eIF2α in vitro by upregulating GADD34 (PPP1R15A), the recruiter of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The induction of GADD34 was linked to ERK/CREB signaling and to CREB-binding protein (CBP)-mediated histone hyperacetylation at the Gadd34 locus. In vitro, WIN also upregulated eIF2B1, an eIF2 activator subunit. We next found that WIN administration in vivo reduced p-eIF2α in the nucleus accumbens of adolescent, but not adult, rats. By contrast, WIN increased dorsal striatal levels of eIF2B1 and ΔFosB among both adolescents and adults. In addition, we found cross-sensitization between WIN and cocaine only among adolescents. These findings show that cannabinoids can modulate eukaryotic initiation factors, and they suggest a possible link between p-eIF2α and the gateway drug properties of psychoactive cannabinoids.

Abstract: Summary
Although autoimmune disorders are a significant source of morbidity and mortality in older individuals, the mechanisms governing age-associated increases in susceptibility remain incompletely understood. Central T cell tolerance is mediated through presentation of self-antigens by cells constituting the thymic microenvironment, including epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and B cells. Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and B cells express distinct cohorts of self-antigens, including tissue-restricted self-antigens (TRAs), such that developing T cells are tolerized to antigens from peripheral tissues. We find that expression of the TRA transcriptional regulator Aire, as well as Aire-dependent genes, declines with age in thymic B cells in mice and humans and that cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms contribute to the diminished capacity of peripheral B cells to express Aire within the thymus. Our findings indicate that aging may diminish the ability of thymic B cells to tolerize T cells, revealing a potential mechanistic link between aging and autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage can be sensed as a danger-associated molecular pattern by the innate immune system. Here we find that keratinocytes and other human cells mount an innate immune response within hours of etoposide-induced DNA damage, which involves the DNA sensing adaptor STING but is independent of the cytosolic DNA receptor cGAS. This non-canonical activation of STING is mediated by the DNA binding protein IFI16, together with the DNA damage response factors ATM and PARP-1, resulting in the assembly of an alternative STING signaling complex that includes the tumor suppressor p53 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. TRAF6 catalyzes the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains on STING, leading to the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and the induction of an alternative STING-dependent gene expression program. We propose that STING acts as a signaling hub that coordinates a transcriptional response depending on its mode of activation.

Abstract: Summary
Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (ADGRs) encompass 33 human transmembrane proteins with long N termini involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. We show the ADGRB1 gene, which encodes Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1), is epigenetically silenced in medulloblastomas (MBs) through a methyl-CpG binding protein MBD2-dependent mechanism. Knockout of Adgrb1 in mice augments proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors, and leads to accelerated tumor growth in the Ptch1+/− transgenic MB mouse model. BAI1 prevents Mdm2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination, and its loss substantially reduces p53 levels. Reactivation of BAI1/p53 signaling axis by a brain-permeable MBD2 pathway inhibitor suppresses MB growth in vivo. Altogether, our data define BAI1's physiological role in tumorigenesis and directly couple an ADGR to cancer formation.

Abstract: Summary
Raman microscopy is an imaging technique that has been applied to assess molecular compositions of living cells to characterize cell types and states. However, owing to the diverse molecular species in cells and challenges of assigning peaks to specific molecules, it has not been clear how to interpret cellular Raman spectra. Here, we provide firm evidence that cellular Raman spectra and transcriptomic profiles of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Escherichia coli can be computationally connected and thus interpreted. We find that the dimensions of high-dimensional Raman spectra and transcriptomes measured by RNA sequencing can be reduced and connected linearly through a shared low-dimensional subspace. Accordingly, we were able to predict global gene expression profiles by applying the calculated transformation matrix to Raman spectra, and vice versa. Highly expressed non-coding RNAs contributed to the Raman-transcriptome linear correspondence more significantly than mRNAs in S. pombe. This demonstration of correspondence between cellular Raman spectra and transcriptomes is a promising step toward establishing spectroscopic live-cell omics studies.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic cells contain large RNA-protein assemblies referred to as RNP granules, whose assembly is promoted by both traditional protein interactions and intrinsically disordered protein domains. Using RNP granules as an example, we provide evidence for an assembly mechanism of large cellular structures wherein specific protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions act together with promiscuous interactions of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). This synergistic assembly mechanism illuminates RNP granule assembly and explains why many components of RNP granules, and other large dynamic assemblies, contain IDRs linked to specific protein-protein or protein-RNA interaction modules. We suggest assemblies based on combinations of specific interactions and promiscuous IDRs are common features of eukaryotic cells.

Abstract: Summary
Whether and how regulation of genes and pathways contributes to physiological aging is topic of intense scientific debate. By performing an RNA expression-based screen for genes downregulated during aging of three different species, we identified glycine-C-acetyltransferase (GCAT, EC 2.3.1.29). Impairing gcat expression promotes the lifespan of C. elegans by interfering with threonine catabolism to promote methylglyoxal (MGO; CAS 78-98-8) formation in an amine oxidase-dependent manner. MGO is a reactive dicarbonyl inducing diabetic complications in mammals by causing oxidative stress and damaging cellular components, including proteins. While high concentrations of MGO consistently exert toxicity in nematodes, we unexpectedly find that low-dose MGO promotes lifespan, resembling key mediators of gcat impairment. These were executed by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, namely PBS-3 and RPN-6.1 subunits, regulated by the stress-responsive transcriptional regulators SKN-1/NRF2 and HSF-1. Taken together, GCAT acts as an evolutionary conserved aging-related gene by orchestrating an unexpected nonlinear impact of proteotoxic MGO on longevity.

Abstract: Summary
The circadian clock and cell cycle as separate pathways have been well documented in plants. Elucidating whether these two oscillators are connected is critical for understanding plant growth. We found that a slow-running circadian clock decelerates the cell cycle and, conversely, a fast clock speeds it up. The clock component TOC1 safeguards the G1-to-S transition and controls the timing of the mitotic cycle at early stages of leaf development. TOC1 also regulates somatic ploidy at later stages of leaf development and in hypocotyl cells. The S-phase is shorter and delayed in TOC1 overexpressing plants, which correlates with the diurnal repression of the DNA replication licensing gene CDC6 through binding of TOC1 to the CDC6 promoter. The slow cell-cycle pace in TOC1-ox also results in delayed tumor progression in inflorescence stalks. Thus, TOC1 sets the time of the DNA pre-replicative machinery to control plant growth in resonance with the environment.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial crista structure partitions vital cellular reactions and is precisely regulated by diverse cellular signals. Here, we show that, in Drosophila, mitochondrial cristae undergo dynamic remodeling among distinct subcellular regions and the Parkinson’s disease (PD)-linked Ser/Thr kinase PINK1 participates in their regulation. Mitochondria increase crista junctions and numbers in selective subcellular areas, and this remodeling requires PINK1 to phosphorylate the inner mitochondrial membrane protein MIC60/mitofilin, which stabilizes MIC60 oligomerization. Expression of MIC60 restores crista structure and ATP levels of PINK1-null flies and remarkably rescues their behavioral defects and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. In an extension to human relevance, we discover that the PINK1-MIC60 pathway is conserved in human neurons, and expression of several MIC60 coding variants in the mitochondrial targeting sequence found in PD patients in Drosophila impairs crista junction formation and causes locomotion deficits. These findings highlight the importance of maintenance and plasticity of crista junctions to cellular homeostasis in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) produces durable responses in some cancer patients; however, most tumors are refractory to ACT and the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance are unclear. Using two independent approaches, we identified tumor glycolysis as a pathway associated with immune resistance in melanoma. Glycolysis-related genes were upregulated in melanoma and lung cancer patient samples poorly infiltrated by T cells. Overexpression of glycolysis-related molecules impaired T cell killing of tumor cells, whereas inhibition of glycolysis enhanced T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, glycolysis-related gene expression was higher in melanoma tissues from ACT-refractory patients, and tumor cells derived from these patients exhibited higher glycolytic activity. We identified reduced levels of IRF1 and CXCL10 immunostimulatory molecules in highly glycolytic melanoma cells. Our findings demonstrate that tumor glycolysis is associated with the efficacy of ACT and identify the glycolysis pathway as a candidate target for combinatorial therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
The vertebrate protein STING, an intracellular sensor of cyclic dinucleotides, is critical to the innate immune response and the induction of type I interferon during pathogenic infection. Here, we show that a STING ortholog (dmSTING) exists in Drosophila, which, similar to vertebrate STING, associates with cyclic dinucleotides to initiate an innate immune response. Following infection with Listeria monocytogenes, dmSTING activates an innate immune response via activation of the NF-κB transcription factor Relish, part of the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway. DmSTING-mediated activation of the immune response reduces the levels of Listeria-induced lethality and bacterial load in the host. Of significance, dmSTING triggers an innate immune response in the absence of a known functional cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS) ortholog in the fly. Together, our results demonstrate that STING is an evolutionarily conserved antimicrobial effector between flies and mammals, and it comprises a key component of host defense against pathogenic infection in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
Recruitment of brown/beige adipocytes (BAs) in white adipose tissue (WAT) involves proliferation and differentiation of adipocyte stem cells (ASCs) in concert with close interactions with resident immune cells. To deconvolve stromal cell heterogeneity in a comprehensive and unbiased fashion, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of >33,000 stromal/vascular cells from epididymal WAT (eWAT) and inguinal WAT (iWAT) under control conditions and during β3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) activation. scRNA-seq identified distinct ASC subpopulations in eWAT and iWAT that appeared to be differentially poised to enter the adipogenic pathway. ADRB3 activation triggered the dramatic appearance of proliferating ASCs in eWAT, whose differentiation into BAs could be inferred from a single time point. scRNA-seq identified various immune cell types in eWAT, including a proliferating macrophage subpopulation that occupies adipogenic niches. These results demonstrate the power of scRNA-seq to deconstruct adipogenic niches and suggest novel functional interactions among resident stromal cell subpopulations.

Abstract: Summary
Variants in the gene locus encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) are associated with inflammatory disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes. The anti-inflammatory role of PTPN2 is highlighted by the fact that PTPN2-deficient mice die a few weeks after birth because of systemic inflammation and severe colitis. However, the tissues, cells, and molecular mechanisms that contribute to this phenotype remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that myeloid cell-specific deletion of PTPN2 in mice (PTPN2-LysMCre) promotes intestinal inflammation but protects from colitis-associated tumor formation in an IL-1β-dependent manner. Elevated levels of mature IL-1β production in PTPN2-LysMCre mice are a consequence of increased inflammasome assembly due to elevated phosphorylation of the inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC. Thus, we have identified a dual role for myeloid PTPN2 in directly regulating inflammasome activation and IL-1β production to suppress pro-inflammatory responses during colitis but promote intestinal tumor development.

Abstract: Summary
Protein-coding genes undergo a wide array of regulatory interactions with factors that engage non-coding regions. Open reading frames (ORFs), in contrast, are thought to be constrained by coding function, precluding a major role in gene regulation. Here, we explore Piwi-interacting (pi)RNA-mediated transgene silencing in C. elegans and show that marked differences in the sensitivity to piRNA silencing map to the endogenous sequences within transgene ORFs. Artificially increasing piRNA targeting within the ORF of a resistant transgene can lead to a partial yet stable reduction in expression, revealing that piRNAs not only silence but can also “tune” gene expression. Our findings support a model that involves a temporal element to mRNA regulation by germline Argonautes, likely prior to translation, and suggest that piRNAs afford incremental control of germline mRNA expression by targeting the body of the mRNA, including the coding region.

Subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem cells (NSCs) are the cornerstone of the perinatal neurogenic niche. Microglia are immune cells of the nervous system that are enriched in the neonatal SVZ. Although microglia regulate NSCs, the extent to which this interaction is bi-directional is unclear. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived particles that encase miRNA and proteins. Here, we demonstrate that SVZ NSCs generate and release EVs. Neonatal electroporated fluorescent EV fusion proteins were released by NSCs and subsequently cleared from the SVZ. EVs were preferentially targeted to microglia. Small RNA sequencing identified miRNAs within the EVs that regulate microglia physiology and morphology. EVs induced a transition to a CD11b/Iba1 non-stellate microglial morphology. The transition accompanied a microglial transcriptional state characterized by Let-7-regulated cytokine release and a negative feedback loop that controlled NSC proliferation. These findings implicate an NSC-EV-microglia axis and provide insight to normal and pathophysiological brain development.

Abstract: Summary
Catecholamines stimulate epithelial proliferation, but the role of sympathetic nerve signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is poorly understood. Catecholamines promoted ADRB2-dependent PDAC development, nerve growth factor (NGF) secretion, and pancreatic nerve density. Pancreatic Ngf overexpression accelerated tumor development in LSL-Kras+/G12D;Pdx1-Cre (KC) mice. ADRB2 blockade together with gemcitabine reduced NGF expression and nerve density, and increased survival of LSL-Kras+/G12D;LSL-Trp53+/R172H;Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mice. Therapy with a Trk inhibitor together with gemcitabine also increased survival of KPC mice. Analysis of PDAC patient cohorts revealed a correlation between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, nerve density, and increased survival of patients on nonselective β-blockers. These findings suggest that catecholamines drive a feedforward loop, whereby upregulation of neurotrophins increases sympathetic innervation and local norepinephrine accumulation.

Abstract: Summary
Abemaciclib, an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), has recently been approved for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. In this study, we use murine syngeneic tumor models and in vitro assays to investigate the impact of abemaciclib on T cells, the tumor immune microenvironment and the ability to combine with anti-PD-L1 blockade. Abemaciclib monotherapy resulted in tumor growth delay that was associated with an increased T cell inflammatory signature in tumors. Combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy led to complete tumor regressions and immunological memory, accompanied by enhanced antigen presentation, a T cell inflamed phenotype, and enhanced cell cycle control. In vitro, treatment with abemaciclib resulted in increased activation of human T cells and upregulated expression of antigen presentation genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. These data collectively support the clinical investigation of the combination of abemaciclib with agents such as anti-PD-L1 that modulate T cell anti-tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic and functional studies underscore the central role of JAK/STAT signaling in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). However, the mechanisms that mediate transformation in MPNs are not fully delineated, and clinically utilized JAK inhibitors have limited ability to reduce disease burden or reverse myelofibrosis. Here we show that MPN progenitor cells are characterized by marked alterations in gene regulation through differential enhancer utilization, and identify nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling as a key pathway activated in malignant and non-malignant cells in MPN. Inhibition of BET bromodomain proteins attenuated NF-κB signaling and reduced cytokine production in vivo. Most importantly, combined JAK/BET inhibition resulted in a marked reduction in the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, reduced disease burden, and reversed bone marrow fibrosis in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Hotspot mutations in splicing factor genes have been recently reported at high frequency in hematological malignancies, suggesting the importance of RNA splicing in cancer. We analyzed whole-exome sequencing data across 33 tumor types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and we identified 119 splicing factor genes with significant non-silent mutation patterns, including mutation over-representation, recurrent loss of function (tumor suppressor-like), or hotspot mutation profile (oncogene-like). Furthermore, RNA sequencing analysis revealed altered splicing events associated with selected splicing factor mutations. In addition, we were able to identify common gene pathway profiles associated with the presence of these mutations. Our analysis suggests that somatic alteration of genes involved in the RNA-splicing process is common in cancer and may represent an underappreciated hallmark of tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Most well-characterized enhancers are deeply conserved. In contrast, genome-wide comparative studies of steady-state systems showed that only a small fraction of active enhancers are conserved. To better understand conservation of enhancer activity, we used a comparative genomics approach that integrates temporal expression and epigenetic profiles in an innate immune system. We found that gene expression programs diverge among mildly induced genes, while being highly conserved for strongly induced genes. The fraction of conserved enhancers varies greatly across gene expression programs, with induced genes and early-response genes, in particular, being regulated by a higher fraction of conserved enhancers. Clustering of conserved accessible DNA sequences within enhancers resulted in over 60 sequence motifs including motifs for known factors, as well as many with unknown function. We further show that the number of instances of these motifs is a strong predictor of the responsiveness of a gene to pathogen detection.

Abstract: Summary
Internal modification of RNAs with N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a highly conserved means of gene expression control. While the METTL3/METTL14 heterodimer adds this mark on thousands of transcripts in a single-stranded context, the substrate requirements and physiological roles of the second m6A writer METTL16 remain unknown. Here we describe the crystal structure of human METTL16 to reveal a methyltransferase domain furnished with an extra N-terminal module, which together form a deep-cut groove that is essential for RNA binding. When presented with a random pool of RNAs, METTL16 selects for methylation-structured RNAs where the critical adenosine is present in a bulge. Mouse 16-cell embryos lacking Mettl16 display reduced mRNA levels of its methylation target, the SAM synthetase Mat2a. The consequence is massive transcriptome dysregulation in ∼64-cell blastocysts that are unfit for further development. This highlights the role of an m6A RNA methyltransferase in facilitating early development via regulation of SAM availability.

Abstract: Summary
Extrinsic signals are implicated in breast cancer resistance to HER2-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). To examine how microenvironmental signals influence resistance, we monitored TKI-treated breast cancer cell lines grown on microenvironment microarrays composed of printed extracellular matrix proteins supplemented with soluble proteins. We tested ∼2,500 combinations of 56 soluble and 46 matrix microenvironmental proteins on basal-like HER2+ (HER2E) or luminal-like HER2+ (L-HER2+) cells treated with the TKIs lapatinib or neratinib. In HER2E cells, hepatocyte growth factor, a ligand for MET, induced resistance that could be reversed with crizotinib, an inhibitor of MET. In L-HER2+ cells, neuregulin1-β1 (NRG1β), a ligand for HER3, induced resistance that could be reversed with pertuzumab, an inhibitor of HER2-HER3 heterodimerization. The subtype-specific responses were also observed in 3D cultures and murine xenografts. These results, along with bioinformatic pathway analysis and siRNA knockdown experiments, suggest different mechanisms of resistance specific to each HER2+ subtype: MET signaling for HER2E and HER2-HER3 heterodimerization for L-HER2+ cells.

Abstract: Summary
Transmissible cancers are clonal lineages that spread through populations via contagious cancer cells. Although rare in nature, two facial tumor clones affect Tasmanian devils. Here we perform comparative genetic and functional characterization of these lineages. The two cancers have similar patterns of mutation and show no evidence of exposure to exogenous mutagens or viruses. Genes encoding PDGF receptors have copy number gains and are present on extrachromosomal double minutes. Drug screening indicates causative roles for receptor tyrosine kinases and sensitivity to inhibitors of DNA repair. Y chromosome loss from a male clone infecting a female host suggests immunoediting. These results imply that Tasmanian devils may have inherent susceptibility to transmissible cancers and present a suite of therapeutic compounds for use in conservation.

Abstract: Summary
Sequences with the capacity to adopt alternative DNA structures have been implicated in cancer etiology; however, the mechanisms are unclear. For example, H-DNA-forming sequences within oncogenes have been shown to stimulate genetic instability in mammals. Here, we report that H-DNA-forming sequences are enriched at translocation breakpoints in human cancer genomes, further implicating them in cancer etiology. H-DNA-induced mutations were suppressed in human cells deficient in the nucleotide excision repair nucleases, ERCC1-XPF and XPG, but were stimulated in cells deficient in FEN1, a replication-related endonuclease. Further, we found that these nucleases cleaved H-DNA conformations, and the interactions of modeled H-DNA with ERCC1-XPF, XPG, and FEN1 proteins were explored at the sub-molecular level. The results suggest mechanisms of genetic instability triggered by H-DNA through distinct structure-specific, cleavage-based replication-independent and replication-dependent pathways, providing critical evidence for a role of the DNA structure itself in the etiology of cancer and other human diseases.

Abstract: Summary
T lymphocyte cytotoxicity relies on a synaptic ring of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), which permits polarized delivery of lytic granules. How LFA-1 organization is controlled by underlying actin cytoskeleton dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we explored the contribution of the actin cytoskeleton regulator WASP to the topography of LFA-1 using a combination of microscopy modalities. We uncover that the reduced cytotoxicity of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patient-derived CD8+ T lymphocytes lacking WASP is associated with reduced LFA-1 activation, unstable synapse, and delayed lethal hit. At the nanometric scale, WASP constrains high-affinity LFA-1 into dense nanoclusters located in actin meshwork interstices. At the cellular scale, WASP is required for the assembly of a radial belt composed of hundreds of LFA-1 nanoclusters and for lytic granule docking within this belt. Our study unravels the nanoscale topography of LFA-1 at the lytic synapse and identifies WASP as a molecule controlling individual LFA-1 cluster density and LFA-1 nanocluster belt integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Naive T cells respond to T cell receptor (TCR) activation by leaving quiescence, remodeling metabolism, initiating expansion, and differentiating toward effector T cells. The molecular mechanisms coordinating the naive to effector transition are central to the functioning of the immune system, but remain elusive. Here, we discover that T cells fulfill this transitional process through translational control. Naive cells accumulate untranslated mRNAs encoding for glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis factors and possess a translational machinery poised for immediate protein synthesis. Upon TCR engagement, activation of the translational machinery leads to synthesis of GLUT1 protein to drive glucose entry. Subsequently, translation of ACC1 mRNA completes metabolic reprogramming toward an effector phenotype. Notably, inhibition of the eIF4F complex abrogates lymphocyte metabolic activation and differentiation, suggesting ACC1 to be a key regulatory node. Thus, our results demonstrate that translation is a direct mediator of T cell metabolism and indicate translation factors as targets for novel immunotherapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Summary
The maintenance of gene expression patterns during metazoan development is achieved, in part, by the actions of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 catalyzes mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27), with H3K27me2/3 being strongly associated with silenced genes. We demonstrate that EZH1 and EZH2, the two mutually exclusive catalytic subunits of PRC2, are differentially activated by various mechanisms. Whereas both PRC2-EZH1 and PRC2-EZH2 are able to catalyze mono- and dimethylation, only PRC2-EZH2 is strongly activated by allosteric modulators and specific chromatin substrates to catalyze trimethylation of H3K27 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, we also show that a PRC2-associated protein, AEBP2, can stimulate the activity of both complexes through a mechanism independent of and additive to allosteric activation. These results have strong implications regarding the cellular requirements for and the accompanying adjustments in PRC2 activity, given the differential expression of EZH1 and EZH2 upon cellular differentiation.
Keywords: PRC2; EZH1; EZH2; AEBP2; allosteric activation; H3K27 methylation

Abstract: Summary
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important phytohormone controlling responses to abiotic stresses and is sensed by proteins from the PYR/PYL/RCAR family. To explore the genetic contribution of PYLs toward ABA-dependent and ABA-independent processes, we generated and characterized high-order Arabidopsis mutants with mutations in the PYL family. We obtained a pyl quattuordecuple mutant and found that it was severely impaired in growth and failed to produce seeds. Thus, we carried out a detailed characterization of a pyl duodecuple mutant, pyr1pyl1/2/3/4/5/7/8/9/10/11/12. The duodecuple mutant was extremely insensitive to ABA effects on seed germination, seedling growth, stomatal closure, leaf senescence, and gene expression. The activation of SnRK2 protein kinases by ABA was blocked in the duodecuple mutant, but, unexpectedly, osmotic stress activation of SnRK2s was enhanced. Our results demonstrate an important role of basal ABA signaling in growth, senescence, and abscission and reveal that PYLs antagonize ABA-independent activation of SnRK2s by osmotic stress.

Abstract: Summary
CTP synthase (CTPS) forms compartmentalized filaments in response to substrate availability and environmental nutrient status. However, the physiological role of filaments and mechanisms for filament assembly are not well understood. Here, we provide evidence that CTPS forms filaments in response to histidine influx during glutamine starvation. Tetramer conformation-based filament formation restricts CTPS enzymatic activity during nutrient deprivation. CTPS protein levels remain stable in the presence of histidine during nutrient deprivation, followed by rapid cell growth after stress relief. We demonstrate that filament formation is controlled by methylation and that histidine promotes re-methylation of homocysteine by donating one-carbon intermediates to the cytosolic folate cycle. Furthermore, we find that starvation stress and glutamine deficiency activate the GCN2/ATF4/MTHFD2 axis, which coordinates CTPS filament formation. CTPS filament formation induced by histidine-mediated methylation may be a strategy used by cancer cells to maintain homeostasis and ensure a growth advantage in adverse environments.

Abstract: Although disturbance of cardiac Ca2+ regulation is involved in the pathophysiology of iron-overload cardiomyopathy, the obvious mechanisms involved in the dysregulation of iron-induced cardiac Ca2+ are unclear. Moreover, the roles of the iron chelator deferiprone and the T-type calcium channel blocker efonidipine on cardiac intracellular Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ regulatory proteins in thalassemic mice are still unknown. We tested the hypothesis that treatment with either deferiprone or efonidipine attenuated cardiac Ca2+ dysregulation and led to improved left ventricular (LV) function in iron-overloaded thalassemic mice. Wild-type (WT) mice and β-thalassemic (HT) mice were fed with either a normal diet (ND) or a high iron-diet (FE) for 90 days. Then, the FE-fed mice were treated with either deferiprone (75 mg/kg/day) or efonidipine (4 mg/kg/day) for 30 days. ND-fed HT mice had an increase in T-type calcium channels (TTCC) and an increased level of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), compared with ND-fed WT mice. Chronic iron feeding led to an increase in TTCC and expression of SERCA proteins in FE-fed WT mice. Moreover, chronic iron overload led to increased plasma non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) and cardiac iron deposition, impaired cardiac intracellular Ca2+ transients including decreased intracellular Ca2+ transient amplitude, rising rate and decay rate, as well as impaired LV function as indicated by a decreased %LV ejection fraction (%LVEF) in both WT and HT mice. Our findings showed that treatment with either deferiprone (DFP) or efonidipine (EFO) showed similar benefits in reducing plasma NTBI and cardiac iron deposition, and improving %LVEF from 84.3 (WT) to 89.3 (DFP) and 89.2 (EFO) treatment; and from 84.2 (HT) to 88.8 (DFP) and 89.5 (EFO) treatment, however there was no improvement in the regulation of cardiac Ca2+ in iron-overloaded thalassemic mice. These findings provide the understanding of the effects of these drugs on the iron-overloaded heart in thalassemic mice and suggest that an alternative intervention that could improve calcium regulation under this condition is needed to improve the therapeutic outcome. Moreover, whether the benefits of the TTCC blocker is via its inhibition of the TTCC alone or together with its ability to chelate iron are still unclear and need further investigation.

Abstract: Summary
Macroautophagy (autophagy) is intimately linked with cell death and allows cells to evade apoptosis. This has prompted clinical trials to combine autophagy inhibitors with other drugs with the aim of increasing the likelihood of cancer cells dying. However, the molecular basis for such effects is unknown. Here, we describe a transcriptional mechanism that connects autophagy to apoptosis. The autophagy-regulating transcription factor, FOXO3a, is itself turned over by basal autophagy creating a potential feedback loop. Increased FOXO3a upon autophagy inhibition stimulates transcription of the pro-apoptotic BBC3/PUMA gene to cause apoptosis sensitization. This mechanism explains how autophagy inhibition can sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy drugs and allows an autophagy inhibitor to change the action of an MDM2-targeted drug from growth inhibition to apoptosis, reducing tumor burden in vivo. Thus, a link between two processes mediated via a single transcription factor binding site in the genome can be leveraged to improve anti-cancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic cytoskeleton dysfunction represents a common pathogenesis in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The serine/threonine kinase PAK2 is a critical regulator of cytoskeleton dynamics. However, its function within the central nervous system and its role in ASD pathogenesis remain undefined. Here, we found that Pak2 haploinsufficiency resulted in markedly decreased synapse densities, defective long-term potentiation, and autism-related behaviors in mice. Phosphorylation levels of key actin regulators LIMK1 and cofilin, together with their mediated actin polymerization, were reduced in Pak2+/− mice. We identified one de novo PAK2 nonsense mutation that impaired PAK2 function in vitro and in vivo and four de novo copy-number deletions containing PAK2 in large cohorts of patients with ASD. PAK2 deficiency extensively perturbed functional networks associated with ASD by regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Our genetic and functional results demonstrate a critical role of PAK2 in brain development and autism pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic spines influence synapse function by boosting synaptic potentials and sequestering synaptically generated second messengers. Spines have been extensively studied in densely spiny principal neurons, but little is known about how they expand the information-gathering capabilities of sparsely spiny interneurons (INs). We find in the mouse primary visual cortex, parvalbumin-positive INs have a low density of spines that enclose functional glutamatergic synapses. Both spine and dendritic synapses contain calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) and NMDA receptors (NMDARs), but NMDARs are enriched at spine synapses. Glutamate-receptor-mediated Ca influx at proximal dendritic sites is bidirectionally modulated by the timing of action potentials (APs). Surprisingly, spine synapses are largely insensitive to APs, but coincident activity originating in the adjacent dendrite strongly influences spine NMDAR-mediated calcium influx. Thus, while glutamate receptors on spines and dendrites are modulated by the activity of the neuron, they are distinctive in the type of coincident activity detected.

Abstract: Summary
The aberrant aggregation of α-synuclein is associated with several human diseases, collectively termed the α-synucleinopathies, which includes Parkinson’s disease. The progression of these diseases is, in part, mediated by extracellular α-synuclein oligomers that may exert effects through several mechanisms, including prion-like transfer, direct cytotoxicity, and pro-inflammatory actions. In this study, we show that two abundant extracellular chaperones, clusterin and α2-macroglobulin, directly bind to exposed hydrophobic regions on the surface of α-synuclein oligomers. Using single-molecule fluorescence techniques, we found that clusterin, unlike α2-macroglobulin, exhibits differential binding to α-synuclein oligomers that may be related to structural differences between two previously described forms of αS oligomers. The binding of both chaperones reduces the ability of the oligomers to permeabilize lipid membranes and prevents an oligomer-induced increase in ROS production in cultured neuronal cells. Taken together, these data suggest a neuroprotective role for extracellular chaperones in suppressing the toxicity associated with α-synuclein oligomers.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal cord longitudinal axons comprise some of the longest axons in our body. However, mechanisms that drive this extra long-distance axonal growth are largely unclear. We found that ascending axons of rapidly adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors closely abut a previously undescribed population of roof plate-derived radial glial-like cells (RGLCs) in the spinal cord dorsal column, which form a network of processes enriched with growth-promoting factors. In dreher mutant mice that lack RGLCs, the lengths of ascending RA mechanoreceptor axon branches are specifically reduced, whereas their descending and collateral branches, and other dorsal column and sensory pathways, are largely unaffected. Because the number and intrinsic growth ability of RA mechanoreceptors are normal in dreher mice, our data suggest that RGLCs provide critical non-cell autonomous growth support for the ascending axons of RA mechanoreceptors. Together, our work identifies a developmental mechanism specifically required for long-range spinal cord longitudinal axons.

Abstract: Summary
We studied 137 primary testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) using high-dimensional assays of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic features. These tumors exhibited high aneuploidy and a paucity of somatic mutations. Somatic mutation of only three genes achieved significance—KIT, KRAS, and NRAS—exclusively in samples with seminoma components. Integrated analyses identified distinct molecular patterns that characterized the major recognized histologic subtypes of TGCT: seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. Striking differences in global DNA methylation and microRNA expression between histology subtypes highlight a likely role of epigenomic processes in determining histologic fates in TGCTs. We also identified a subset of pure seminomas defined by KIT mutations, increased immune infiltration, globally demethylated DNA, and decreased KRAS copy number. We report potential biomarkers for risk stratification, such as miRNA specifically expressed in teratoma, and others with molecular diagnostic potential, such as CpH (CpA/CpC/CpT) methylation identifying embryonal carcinomas.

Abstract: Summary
Melanocortin 4 receptor (Mc4r) plays a crucial role in the central control of energy homeostasis, but its role in peripheral organs has not been fully explored. We have investigated the roles of hypothalamus-mediated energy metabolism during Xenopus limb regeneration. We report that hypothalamus injury inhibits Xenopus tadpole limb regeneration. By loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies, we show that Mc4r signaling is required for limb regeneration in regeneration-competent tadpoles and stimulates limb regeneration in later-stage regeneration-defective tadpoles. It regulates limb regeneration through modulating energy homeostasis and ROS production. Even more interestingly, our results demonstrate that Mc4r signaling is regulated by innervation and α-MSH substitutes for the effect of nerves in limb regeneration. Mc4r signaling is also required for mouse digit regeneration. Thus, our findings link vertebrate limb regeneration with Mc4r-mediated energy homeostasis and provide a new avenue for understanding Mc4r signaling in the peripheral organs.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived T cells may provide future therapies for cancer patients, but those generated by current methods, such as the OP9/DLL1 system, have shown abnormalities that pose major barriers for clinical translation. Our data indicate that these iPSC-derived CD8 single-positive T cells are more like CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells than mature naive T cells because they display phenotypic markers of developmental arrest and an innate-like phenotype after stimulation. We developed a 3D thymic culture system to avoid these aberrant developmental fates, generating a homogeneous subset of CD8αβ+ antigen-specific T cells, designated iPSC-derived thymic emigrants (iTEs). iTEs exhibit phenotypic and functional similarities to naive T cells both in vitro and in vivo, including the capacity for expansion, memory formation, and tumor suppression. These data illustrate the limitations of current methods and provide a tool to develop the next generation of iPSC-based antigen-specific immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
The cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly (CIA) pathway functions to incorporate inorganic Fe-S cofactors into a variety of proteins, including several DNA repair enzymes. However, the mechanisms regulating the CIA pathway are unknown. We describe here that the MAGE-F1-NSE1 E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates the CIA pathway through ubiquitination and degradation of the CIA-targeting protein MMS19. Overexpression or knockout of MAGE-F1 altered Fe-S incorporation into MMS19-dependent DNA repair enzymes, DNA repair capacity, sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, and iron homeostasis. Intriguingly, MAGE-F1 has undergone adaptive pseudogenization in select mammalian lineages. In contrast, MAGE-F1 is highly amplified in multiple human cancer types and amplified tumors have increased mutational burden. Thus, flux through the CIA pathway can be regulated by degradation of the substrate-specifying MMS19 protein and its downregulation is a common feature in cancer and is evolutionarily controlled.

Abstract: Summary
Beyond sample curation and basic pathologic characterization, the digitized H&E-stained images of TCGA samples remain underutilized. To highlight this resource, we present mappings of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) based on H&E images from 13 TCGA tumor types. These TIL maps are derived through computational staining using a convolutional neural network trained to classify patches of images. Affinity propagation revealed local spatial structure in TIL patterns and correlation with overall survival. TIL map structural patterns were grouped using standard histopathological parameters. These patterns are enriched in particular T cell subpopulations derived from molecular measures. TIL densities and spatial structure were differentially enriched among tumor types, immune subtypes, and tumor molecular subtypes, implying that spatial infiltrate state could reflect particular tumor cell aberration states. Obtaining spatial lymphocytic patterns linked to the rich genomic characterization of TCGA samples demonstrates one use for the TCGA image archives with insights into the tumor-immune microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCM) holds great potential for heart regeneration and disease modeling and may lead to future therapeutic applications. Currently, application of this technology is limited by our lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive direct iCM reprogramming. Using a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach, we identified the temporal global changes in protein abundance that occur during initial phases of iCM reprogramming. Collectively, our results show systematic and temporally distinct alterations in levels of specific functional classes of proteins during the initiating steps of reprogramming including extracellular matrix proteins, translation factors, and chromatin-binding proteins. We have constructed protein relational networks associated with the initial transition of a fibroblast into an iCM. These findings demonstrate the presence of an orchestrated series of temporal steps associated with dynamic changes in protein abundance in a defined group of protein pathways during the initiating events of direct reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Motor neurons in the spinal cord are found grouped in nuclear structures termed pools, whose position is precisely orchestrated during development. Despite the emerging role of pool organization in the assembly of spinal circuits, little is known about the morphogenetic programs underlying the patterning of motor neuron subtypes. We applied three-dimensional analysis of motor neuron position to reveal the roles and contributions of cell adhesive function by inactivating N-cadherin, catenin, and afadin signaling. Our findings reveal that nuclear organization of motor neurons is dependent on inside-out positioning, orchestrated by N-cadherin, catenin, and afadin activities, controlling cell body layering on the medio-lateral axis. In addition to this lamination-like program, motor neurons undergo a secondary, independent phase of organization. This process results in segregation of motor neurons along the dorso-ventral axis of the spinal cord, does not require N-cadherin or afadin activity, and can proceed even when medio-lateral positioning is perturbed.

Abstract: Summary
Stress exposure is associated with the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Here, we show in rodents that chronic stress exposure rapidly and transiently elevates hippocampal expression of Kruppel-like factor 9 (Klf9). Inducible genetic silencing of Klf9 expression in excitatory forebrain neurons in adulthood prior to, but not after, onset of stressor prevented chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced potentiation of contextual fear acquisition in female mice and chronic corticosterone (CORT) exposure-induced fear generalization in male mice. Klf9 silencing prevented chronic CORT and CRS induced enlargement of dendritic spines in the ventral hippocampus of male and female mice, respectively. KLF9 mRNA density was increased in the anterior dentate gyrus of women, but not men, with more severe recent stressful life events and increased mortality. Thus, Klf9 functions as a stress-responsive transcription factor that mediates circuit and behavioral resilience in a sex-specific manner.

Abstract: Summary
ECSIT is a mitochondrial complex I (CI)-associated protein that has been shown to regulate the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) following engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We have generated an Ecsit conditional knockout (CKO) mouse strain to study the in vivo role of ECSIT. ECSIT deletion results in profound alteration of macrophage metabolism, leading to a striking shift to reliance on glycolysis, complete disruption of CI activity, and loss of the CI holoenzyme and multiple subassemblies. An increase in constitutive mROS production in ECSIT-deleted macrophages prevents further TLR-induced mROS production. Surprisingly, ECSIT-deleted cells accumulate damaged mitochondria because of defective mitophagy. ECSIT associates with the mitophagy regulator PINK1 and exhibits Parkin-dependent ubiquitination. However, upon ECSIT deletion, we observed increased mitochondrial Parkin without the expected increase in mitophagy. Taken together, these results demonstrate a key role of ECSIT in CI function, mROS production, and mitophagy-dependent mitochondrial quality control.

Abstract: Summary
Neural information processing entails a high energetic cost, but its maintenance is crucial for animal survival. However, the brain’s energy conservation strategies are incompletely understood. Employing functional brain-wide imaging and quantitative behavioral assays, we describe a neuronal strategy in Caenorhabditis elegans that balances energy availability and expenditure. Upon acute food deprivation, animals exhibit a transiently elevated state of arousal, indicated by foraging behaviors and increased responsiveness to food-related cues. In contrast, long-term starvation suppresses these behaviors and biases animals to intermittent sleep episodes. Brain-wide neuronal population dynamics, which are likely energetically costly but important for behavior, are robust to starvation while animals are awake. However, during starvation-induced sleep, brain dynamics are systemically downregulated. Neuromodulation via insulin-like signaling is required to transiently maintain the animals’ arousal state upon acute food deprivation. Our data suggest that the regulation of sleep and wakefulness supports optimal energy allocation.

Abstract: Summary
Basal nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation is required for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis in the absence of inflammation; however, the upstream mediators of basal NF-κB signaling are less well understood. Here, we describe TRAF6 as an essential regulator of HSC homeostasis through basal activation of NF-κB. Hematopoietic-specific deletion of Traf6 resulted in impaired HSC self-renewal and fitness. Gene expression, RNA splicing, and molecular analyses of Traf6-deficient hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) revealed changes in adaptive immune signaling, innate immune signaling, and NF-κB signaling, indicating that signaling via TRAF6 in the absence of cytokine stimulation and/or infection is required for HSC function. In addition, we established that loss of IκB kinase beta (IKKβ)-mediated NF-κB activation is responsible for the major hematopoietic defects observed in Traf6-deficient HSPC as deletion of IKKβ similarly resulted in impaired HSC self-renewal and fitness. Taken together, TRAF6 is required for HSC homeostasis by maintaining a minimal threshold level of IKKβ/NF-κB signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Cysteine cathepsins play roles during development and disease beyond their function in lysosomal protein turnover. Here, we leverage a fluorescent activity-based probe (ABP), BMV109, to track cysteine cathepsins in normal and diseased zebrafish embryos. Using this probe in a model of mucolipidosis II, we show that loss of carbohydrate-dependent lysosomal sorting alters the activity of several cathepsin proteases. The data support a pathogenic mechanism where TGF-ß signals enhance the proteolytic processing of pro-Ctsk by modulating the expression of chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4-S). In MLII, elevated C4-S corresponds with TGF-ß-mediated increases in chst11 expression. Inhibiting chst11 impairs the proteolytic activation of Ctsk and alleviates the MLII phenotypes. These findings uncover a regulatory loop between TGF-ß signaling and Ctsk activation that is altered in the context of lysosomal disease. This work highlights the power of ABPs to identify mechanisms underlying pathogenic development in living animals.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional regulator YAP1 is critical for the pathological activation of fibroblasts. In normal fibroblasts, YAP1 is located in the cytoplasm, while in activated cancer-associated fibroblasts, it is nuclear and promotes the expression of genes required for pro-tumorigenic functions. Here, we investigate the dynamics of YAP1 shuttling in normal and activated fibroblasts, using EYFP-YAP1, quantitative photobleaching methods, and mathematical modeling. Imaging of migrating fibroblasts reveals the tight temporal coupling of cell shape change and altered YAP1 localization. Both 14-3-3 and TEAD binding modulate YAP1 shuttling, but neither affects nuclear import. Instead, we find that YAP1 nuclear accumulation in activated fibroblasts results from Src and actomyosin-dependent suppression of phosphorylated YAP1 export. Finally, we show that nuclear-constrained YAP1, upon XPO1 depletion, remains sensitive to blockade of actomyosin function. Together, these data place nuclear export at the center of YAP1 regulation and indicate that the cytoskeleton can regulate YAP1 within the nucleus.

Abstract: Rod cell membranes contain cholesterol-rich detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) rafts, which accumulate visual cascade proteins as well as proteins involved in regulation of phototransduction such as rhodopsin kinase and guanylate cyclases. Caveolin-1 is the major integral component of DRMs, possessing scaffolding and regulatory activities towards various signaling proteins. In this study, photoreceptor Ca2+-binding proteins recoverin, NCS1, GCAP1, and GCAP2, belonging to neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family, were recognized as novel caveolin-1 interacting partners. All four NCS proteins co-fractionate with caveolin-1 in DRMs, isolated from illuminated bovine rod outer segments. According to pull-down assay, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry data, they are capable of high-affinity binding to either N-terminal fragment of caveolin-1 (1–101), or its short scaffolding domain (81–101) via a novel structural site. In recoverin this site is localized in C-terminal domain in proximity to the third EF-hand motif and composed of aromatic amino acids conserved among NCS proteins. Remarkably, the binding of NCS proteins to caveolin-1 occurs only in the absence of calcium, which is in agreement with higher accessibility of the caveolin-1 binding site in their Ca2+-free forms. Consistently, the presence of caveolin-1 produces no effect on regulatory activity of Ca2+-saturated recoverin or NCS1 towards rhodopsin kinase, but upregulates GCAP2, which potentiates guanylate cyclase activity being in Ca2+-free conformation. In addition, the interaction with caveolin-1 decreases cooperativity and augments affinity of Ca2 + binding to recoverin apparently by facilitating exposure of its myristoyl group. We suggest that at low calcium NCS proteins are compartmentalized in photoreceptor rafts via binding to caveolin-1, which may enhance their activity or ensure their faster responses on Ca2+-signals thereby maintaining efficient phototransduction recovery and light adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the molecular basis of morphological change remains a central challenge in evolutionary-developmental biology. The transition from outbreeding to selfing is often associated with a dramatic reduction in reproductive structures and functions, such as the loss of attractive pheromones in hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis elegans and a reduced flower size in plants. Here, we demonstrate that variation in the level of the brassinosteroid-biosynthesis enzyme CYP724A1 contributes to the reduced flower size of selfing Capsella rubella compared with its outbreeding ancestor Capsella grandiflora. The primary transcript of the C. rubella allele is spliced more efficiently than that of C. grandiflora, resulting in higher brassinosteroid levels. These restrict organ growth by limiting cell proliferation. More efficient splicing of the C. rubella allele results from two de novo mutations in the selfing lineage. Thus, our results highlight the potentially widespread importance of differential splicing efficiency and higher-than-optimal hormone levels in generating phenotypic variation.

Abstract: Summary
Gcn4 is a yeast transcriptional activator induced by amino acid starvation. ChIP-seq analysis revealed 546 genomic sites occupied by Gcn4 in starved cells, representing ∼30% of Gcn4-binding motifs. Surprisingly, only ∼40% of the bound sites are in promoters, of which only ∼60% activate transcription, indicating extensive negative control over Gcn4 function. Most of the remaining ∼300 Gcn4-bound sites are within coding sequences (CDSs), with ∼75 representing the only bound sites near Gcn4-induced genes. Many such unconventional sites map between divergent antisense and sub-genic sense transcripts induced within CDSs adjacent to induced TBP peaks, consistent with Gcn4 activation of cryptic bidirectional internal promoters. Mutational analysis confirms that Gcn4 sites within CDSs can activate sub-genic and full-length transcripts from the same or adjacent genes, showing that functional Gcn4 binding is not confined to promoters. Our results show that internal promoters can be regulated by an activator that functions at conventional 5′-positioned promoters.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary intervention constitutes a feasible approach for modulating metabolism and improving the health span and lifespan. Methionine restriction (MR) delays the appearance of age-related diseases and increases longevity in normal mice. However, the effect of MR on premature aging remains to be elucidated. Here, we describe that MR extends lifespan in two different mouse models of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) by reversing the transcriptome alterations in inflammation and DNA-damage response genes present in this condition. Further, MR improves the lipid profile and changes bile acid levels and conjugation, both in wild-type and in progeroid mice. Notably, treatment with cholic acid improves the health span and lifespan in vivo. These results suggest the existence of a metabolic pathway involved in the longevity extension achieved by MR and support the possibility of dietary interventions for treating progeria.

Abstract: Summary
The heavily glycosylated native-like envelope (Env) trimer of HIV-1 is expected to have low immunogenicity, whereas misfolded forms are often highly immunogenic. High-quality correctly folded Envs may therefore be critical for developing a vaccine that induces broadly neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the high variability of Env may require immunizations with multiple Envs. Here, we report a universal strategy that provides for correctly folded Env trimers of high quality and yield through a repair-and-stabilize approach. In the repair stage, we utilized a consensus strategy that substituted rare strain-specific residues with more prevalent ones. The stabilization stage involved structure-based design and experimental assessment confirmed by crystallographic feedback. Regions important for the refolding of Env were targeted for stabilization. Notably, the α9-helix and an intersubunit β sheet proved to be critical for trimer stability. Our approach provides a means to produce prefusion-closed Env trimers from diverse HIV-1 strains, a substantial advance for vaccine development.

Abstract: Summary
The bioenergetics and molecular determinants of the metabolic response to mitochondrial dysfunction are incompletely understood, in part due to a lack of appropriate isogenic cellular models of primary mitochondrial defects. Here, we capitalize on a recently developed cell model with defined levels of m.8993T>G mutation heteroplasmy, mTUNE, to investigate the metabolic underpinnings of mitochondrial dysfunction. We found that impaired utilization of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) by the mitochondrial respiratory chain leads to cytosolic reductive carboxylation of glutamine as a new mechanism for cytosol-confined NADH recycling supported by malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1). We also observed that increased glycolysis in cells with mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with increased cell migration in an MDH1-dependent fashion. Our results describe a novel link between glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by reductive carboxylation of glutamine.

Abstract: Spontaneous neuronal activity and concomitant intracellular Ca2+ signaling are abundant during early perinatal development and are well known for their key role in neuronal proliferation, migration, differentiation and wiring. However, much less is known about the in vivo patterns of spontaneous Ca2+ signaling in immature adult-born cells. Here, by using two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we analyzed spontaneous in vivo Ca2+ signaling in adult-born juxtaglomerular cells of the mouse olfactory bulb over the time period of 5 weeks, from the day of their arrival in the glomerular layer till their stable integration into the preexisting neural network. We show that spontaneous Ca2+ transients are ubiquitously present in adult-born cells right after their arrival, require activation of voltage-gated Na+ channels and are little sensitive to isoflurane anesthesia. Interestingly, several parameters of this spontaneous activity, such as the area under the curve, the time spent in the active state as well as the fraction of continuously active cells show a bell-shaped dependence on cell’s age, all peaking in 3–4 weeks old cells. This data firmly document the in vivo presence of spontaneous Ca2+ signaling during the layer-specific maturation of adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb and motivate further analyses of the functional role(s) of this activity.

Abstract: Summary
The optic neuroepithelial continuum of vertebrate eye develops into three differentially growing compartments: the retina, the ciliary margin (CM), and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Neurofibromin 2 (Nf2) is strongly expressed in slowly expanding RPE and CM compartments, and the loss of mouse Nf2 causes hyperplasia in these compartments, replicating the ocular abnormalities seen in human NF2 patients. The hyperplastic ocular phenotypes were largely suppressed by heterozygous deletion of Yap and Taz, key targets of the Nf2-Hippo signaling pathway. We also found that, in addition to feedback transcriptional regulation of Nf2 by Yap/Taz in the CM, activation of Nf2 expression by Mitf in the RPE and suppression by Sox2 in retinal progenitor cells are necessary for the differential growth of the corresponding cell populations. Together, our findings reveal that Nf2 is a key player that orchestrates the differential growth of optic neuroepithelial compartments during vertebrate eye development.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of metabolic homeostasis requires adaption of gene regulation to the cellular energy state via transcriptional regulators. Here, we identify a role of ceramide synthase (CerS) Schlank, a multiple transmembrane protein containing a catalytic lag1p motif and a homeodomain, which is poorly studied in CerSs, as a transcriptional regulator. ChIP experiments show that it binds promoter regions of lipases lipase3 and magro via its homeodomain. Mutation of nuclear localization site 2 (NLS2) within the homeodomain leads to loss of DNA binding and deregulated gene expression, and NLS2 mutants can no longer adjust the transcriptional response to changing lipid levels. This mechanism is conserved in mammalian CerS2 and emphasizes the importance of the CerS protein rather than ceramide synthesis. This study demonstrates a double role of CerS Schlank as an enzyme and a transcriptional regulator, sensing lipid levels and transducing the information to the level of gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Whereas the actions of enhancers in gene transcriptional regulation are well established, roles of JmjC-domain-containing proteins in mediating enhancer activation remain poorly understood. Here, we report that recruitment of the JmjC-domain-containing protein 6 (JMJD6) to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-bound active enhancers is required for RNA polymerase II recruitment and enhancer RNA production on enhancers, resulting in transcriptional pause release of cognate estrogen target genes. JMJD6 is found to interact with MED12 in the mediator complex to regulate its recruitment. Unexpectedly, JMJD6 is necessary for MED12 to interact with CARM1, which methylates MED12 at multiple arginine sites and regulates its chromatin binding. Consistent with its role in transcriptional activation, JMJD6 is required for estrogen/ERα-induced breast cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis. Our data have uncovered a critical regulator of estrogen/ERα-induced enhancer coding gene activation and breast cancer cell potency, providing a potential therapeutic target of ER-positive breast cancers.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of metastatic organotropism in pancreatic ductal a denocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poorly understood. We demonstrate, using multiple mouse models, that liver and lung metastatic organotropism is dependent upon p120catenin (p120ctn)-mediated epithelial identity. Mono-allelic p120ctn loss accelerates KrasG12D-driven pancreatic cancer formation and liver metastasis. Importantly, one p120ctn allele is sufficient for E-CADHERIN-mediated cell adhesion. By contrast, cells with bi-allelic p120ctn loss demonstrate marked lung organotropism; however, rescue with p120ctn isoform 1A restores liver metastasis. In a p120ctn-independent PDAC model, mosaic loss of E-CADHERIN expression reveals selective pressure for E-CADHERIN-positive liver metastasis and E-CADHERIN-negative lung metastasis. Furthermore, human PDAC and liver metastases support the premise that liver metastases exhibit predominantly epithelial characteristics. RNA-seq demonstrates differential induction of pathways associated with metastasis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in p120ctn-deficient versus p120ctn-wild-type cells. Taken together, P120CTN and E-CADHERIN mediated epithelial plasticity is an addition to the conceptual framework underlying metastatic organotropism in pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Summary
LIN28 is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the maturation of the let-7 family of microRNAs by bipartite interactions with let-7 precursors through its two distinct cold shock and zinc-knuckle domains. Through inhibition of let-7 biogenesis, LIN28 functions as a pluripotency factor, as well as a driver of tumorigenesis. Here, we report a fluorescence polarization assay to identify small-molecule inhibitors for both domains of LIN28 involved in let-7 interactions. Of 101,017 compounds screened, six inhibit LIN28:let-7 binding and impair LIN28-mediated let-7 oligouridylation. Upon further characterization, we demonstrate that the LIN28 inhibitor TPEN destabilizes the zinc-knuckle domain of LIN28, while LI71 binds the cold shock domain to suppress LIN28’s activity against let-7 in leukemia cells and embryonic stem cells. Our results demonstrate selective pharmacologic inhibition of individual domains of LIN28 and provide a foundation for therapeutic inhibition of the let-7 biogenesis pathway in LIN28-driven diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Rare neurological diseases shed light onto universal neurobiological processes. However, molecular mechanisms connecting genetic defects to their disease phenotypes are elusive. Here, we obtain mechanistic information by comparing proteomes of cells from individuals with rare disorders with proteomes from their disease-free consanguineous relatives. We use triple-SILAC mass spectrometry to quantify proteomes from human pedigrees affected by mutations in ATP7A, which cause Menkes disease, a rare neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorder stemming from systemic copper depletion. We identified 214 proteins whose expression was altered in ATP7A−/y fibroblasts. Bioinformatic analysis of ATP7A-mutant proteomes identified known phenotypes and processes affected in rare genetic diseases causing copper dyshomeostasis, including altered mitochondrial function. We found connections between copper dyshomeostasis and the UCHL1/PARK5 pathway of Parkinson disease, which we validated with mitochondrial respiration and Drosophila genetics assays. We propose that our genealogical “omics” strategy can be broadly applied to identify mechanisms linking a genomic locus to its phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Lipotoxic cardiomyopathy (LCM) is characterized by abnormal myocardial accumulation of lipids, including ceramide; however, the contribution of ceramide to the etiology of LCM is unclear. Here, we investigated the association of ceramide metabolism and ceramide-interacting proteins (CIPs) in LCM in the Drosophila heart model. We find that ceramide feeding or ceramide-elevating genetic manipulations are strongly associated with cardiac dilation and defects in contractility. High ceramide-associated LCM is prevented by inhibiting ceramide synthesis, establishing a robust model of direct ceramide-associated LCM, corroborating previous indirect evidence in mammals. We identified several CIPs from mouse heart and Drosophila extracts, including caspase activator Annexin-X, myosin chaperone Unc-45, and lipogenic enzyme FASN1, and remarkably, their cardiac-specific manipulation can prevent LCM. Collectively, these data suggest that high ceramide-associated lipotoxicity is mediated, in part, through altering caspase activation, sarcomeric maintenance, and lipogenesis, thus providing evidence for conserved mechanisms in LCM pathogenesis in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is more common in western countries with diet being a potential contributing factor. Here we show that intermittent fasting (IF) ameliorated clinical course and pathology of the MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). IF led to increased gut bacteria richness, enrichment of the Lactobacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Prevotellaceae families and enhanced antioxidative microbial metabolic pathways. IF altered T cells in the gut with a reduction of IL-17 producing T cells and an increase in regulatory T cells. Fecal microbiome transplantation from mice on IF ameliorated EAE in immunized recipient mice on a normal diet, suggesting that IF effects are at least partially mediated by the gut flora. In a pilot clinical trial in MS patients, intermittent energy restriction altered blood adipokines and the gut flora resembling protective changes observed in mice. In conclusion, IF has potent immunomodulatory effects that are at least partially mediated by the gut microbiome.

Abstract: Summary
The differentiation of alveolar epithelial type I (AT1) and type II (AT2) cells is essential for the lung gas exchange function. Disruption of this process results in neonatal death or in severe lung diseases that last into adulthood. We developed live imaging techniques to characterize the mechanisms that control alveolar epithelial cell differentiation. We discovered that mechanical forces generated from the inhalation of amniotic fluid by fetal breathing movements are essential for AT1 cell differentiation. We found that a large subset of alveolar progenitor cells is able to protrude from the airway epithelium toward the mesenchyme in an FGF10/FGFR2 signaling-dependent manner. The cell protrusion process results in enrichment of myosin in the apical region of protruded cells; this myosin prevents these cells from being flattened by mechanical forces, thereby ensuring their AT2 cell fate. Our study demonstrates that mechanical forces and local growth factors synergistically control alveolar epithelial cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The influenza virus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Yet, both the impact of intracellular viral replication and the variation in host response across different cell types remain uncharacterized. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the heterogeneity in the response of lung tissue cells to in vivo influenza infection. Analysis of viral and host transcriptomes in the same single cell enabled us to resolve the cellular heterogeneity of bystander (exposed but uninfected) as compared with infected cells. We reveal that all major immune and non-immune cell types manifest substantial fractions of infected cells, albeit at low viral transcriptome loads relative to epithelial cells. We show that all cell types respond primarily with a robust generic transcriptional response, and we demonstrate novel markers specific for influenza-infected as opposed to bystander cells. These findings open new avenues for targeted therapy aimed exclusively at infected cells.

Abstract: Summary
Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitors such as vismodegib are highly effective for treating basal cell carcinoma (BCC); however, residual tumor cells frequently persist and regenerate the primary tumor upon drug discontinuation. Here, we show that BCCs are organized into two molecularly and functionally distinct compartments. Whereas interior Hh+/Notch+ suprabasal cells undergo apoptosis in response to vismodegib, peripheral Hh+++/Notch− basal cells survive throughout treatment. Inhibiting Notch specifically promotes tumor persistence without causing drug resistance, while activating Notch is sufficient to regress already established lesions. Altogether, these findings suggest that the three-dimensional architecture of BCCs establishes a natural hierarchy of drug response in the tumor and that this hierarchy can be overcome, for better or worse, by modulating Notch.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of mitochondrial RNA life cycles and their roles in ribosome biogenesis and energy metabolism are not fully understood. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate heart- and skeletal-muscle-specific knockout mice of the pentatricopeptide repeat domain protein 1, PTCD1, and show that its loss leads to severe cardiomyopathy and premature death. Our detailed transcriptome-wide and functional analyses of these mice enabled us to identify the molecular role of PTCD1 as a 16S rRNA-binding protein essential for its stability, pseudouridylation, and correct biogenesis of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit. We show that impaired mitoribosome biogenesis can have retrograde signaling effects on nuclear gene expression through the transcriptional activation of the mTOR pathway and upregulation of cytoplasmic protein synthesis and pro-survival factors in the absence of mitochondrial translation. Taken together, our data show that impaired assembly of the mitoribosome exerts its consequences via differential regulation of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic protein synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
The age-related effects of GDF11 have been a subject of controversy. Here, we find that elevated GDF11 causes signs of cachexia in mice: reduced food intake, body weight, and muscle mass. GDF11 also elicited a significant elevation in plasma Activin A, previously shown to contribute to the loss of skeletal muscle. The effects of GDF11 on skeletal muscle could be reversed by administration of antibodies to the Activin type II receptors. In addition to the effects on muscle, GDF11 increased plasma GDF15, an anorectic agent. The anorexia, but not the muscle loss, could be reversed with a GDF15-neutralizing antibody. GDF15 upregulation is due to GDF11-induced recruitment of SMAD2/3 to the GDF15 promoter. Inhibition of GDF15 can restore appetite but cannot restore the GDF11-induced loss of muscle mass, which requires blockade of ActRII signaling. These findings are relevant for treatment of cachexia.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiomyocytes from the apex but not the base of the heart increase their contractility in response to β2-adrenoceptor (β2AR) stimulation, which may underlie the development of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However, both cell types produce comparable cytosolic amounts of the second messenger cAMP. We investigated this discrepancy using nanoscale imaging techniques and found that, structurally, basal cardiomyocytes have more organized membranes (higher T-tubular and caveolar densities). Local membrane microdomain responses measured in isolated basal cardiomyocytes or in whole hearts revealed significantly smaller and more short-lived β2AR/cAMP signals. Inhibition of PDE4, caveolar disruption by removing cholesterol or genetic deletion of Cav3 eliminated differences in local cAMP production and equilibrated the contractile response to β2AR. We conclude that basal cells possess tighter control of cAMP because of a higher degree of signaling microdomain organization. This provides varying levels of nanostructural control for cAMP-mediated functional effects that orchestrate macroscopic, regional physiological differences within the heart.

Abstract: Summary
Diet, genetics, and the gut microbiome are determinants of metabolic status, in part through production of metabolites by the gut microbiota. To understand the mechanisms linking these factors, we performed LC-MS-based metabolomic analysis of cecal contents and plasma from C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, and 129S6/SvEvTac mice on chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) and HFD-treated with vancomycin or metronidazole. Prediction of the functional metagenome of gut bacteria by PICRUSt analysis of 16S sequences revealed dramatic differences in microbial metabolism. Cecal and plasma metabolites showed multifold differences reflecting the combined and integrated effects of diet, antibiotics, host background, and the gut microbiome. Eighteen plasma metabolites correlated positively or negatively with host insulin resistance across strains and diets. Over 1,000 still-unidentified metabolite peaks were also highly regulated by diet, antibiotics, and genetic background. Thus, diet, host genetics, and the gut microbiota interact to create distinct responses in plasma metabolites, which can contribute to regulation of metabolism and insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Sleep regulation involves interdependent signaling among specialized neurons in distributed brain regions. Although acetylcholine promotes wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, it is unclear whether the cholinergic pathway is essential (i.e., absolutely required) for REM sleep because of redundancy from neural circuits to molecules. First, we demonstrate that synaptic inhibition of TrkA+ cholinergic neurons causes a severe short-sleep phenotype and that sleep reduction is mostly attributable to a shortened sleep duration in the dark phase. Subsequent comprehensive knockout of acetylcholine receptor genes by the triple-target CRISPR method reveals that a similar short-sleep phenotype appears in the knockout of two Gq-type acetylcholine receptors Chrm1 and Chrm3. Strikingly, Chrm1 and Chrm3 double knockout chronically diminishes REM sleep to an almost undetectable level. These results suggest that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, Chrm1 and Chrm3, are essential for REM sleep.

Abstract: Summary
Expression of vast repertoires of antigen receptors by lymphocytes, with each cell expressing a single receptor, requires stochastic activation of individual variable (V) genes for transcription and recombination. How this occurs remains unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and allelic variation, we show that individual pre-B cells monoallelically transcribe divergent arrays of Vκ genes, thereby opening stochastic repertoires for subsequent Vκ-Jκ recombination. Transcription occurs upon translocation of Vκ genes to RNA polymerase II arrayed on the nuclear matrix in transcription factories. Transcription is anchored by CTCF-bound sites or E2A-loaded Vκ promotors and continues over large genomic distances delimited only by topological associating domains (TADs). Prior to their monoallelic activation, Vκ loci are transcriptionally repressed by cyclin D3, which prevents capture of Vκ gene containing TADs by transcription factories. Cyclin D3 also represses protocadherin, olfactory, and other monoallelically expressed genes, suggesting a widely deployed mechanism for coupling monoallelic gene activation with cell cycle exit.

Abstract: Summary
Exposure to the herbicide paraquat (PQ) is associated with an increased risk of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD). Therapies based on PQ’s presumed mechanisms of action have not, however, yielded effective disease therapies. Cellular senescence is an anticancer mechanism that arrests proliferation of replication-competent cells and results in a pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) capable of damaging neighboring tissues. Here, we demonstrate that senescent cell markers are preferentially present within astrocytes in PD brain tissues. Additionally, PQ was found to induce astrocytic senescence and an SASP in vitro and in vivo, and senescent cell depletion in the latter protects against PQ-induced neuropathology. Our data suggest that exposure to certain environmental toxins promotes accumulation of senescent cells in the aging brain, which can contribute to dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Therapies that target senescent cells may constitute a strategy for treatment of sporadic PD, for which environmental exposure is a major risk factor.

Abstract: Summary
The underlying mechanisms of how self-renewing cells are controlled in regenerating tissues and cancer remain ambiguous. PCNA-associated factor (PAF) modulates DNA repair via PCNA. Also, PAF hyperactivates Wnt/β-catenin signaling independently of PCNA interaction. We found that PAF is expressed in intestinal stem and progenitor cells (ISCs and IPCs) and markedly upregulated during intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis. Whereas PAF is dispensable for intestinal homeostasis, upon radiation injury, genetic ablation of PAF impairs intestinal regeneration along with the severe loss of ISCs and Myc expression. Mechanistically, PAF conditionally occupies and transactivates the c-Myc promoter, which induces the expansion of ISCs/IPCs during intestinal regeneration. In mouse models, PAF knockout inhibits Apc inactivation-driven intestinal tumorigenesis with reduced tumor cell stemness and suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity, supported by transcriptome profiling. Collectively, our results unveil that the PAF-Myc signaling axis is indispensable for intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis by positively regulating self-renewing cells.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is strongly implicated in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. EMT is thought to be regulated primarily at the transcriptional level through the repressive activity of EMT transcription factors. However, these classical mechanisms have been parsed out almost exclusively in vitro, leaving questions about the programs driving EMT in physiological contexts. Here, using a lineage-labeled mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to study EMT in vivo, we found that most tumors lose their epithelial phenotype through an alternative program involving protein internalization rather than transcriptional repression, resulting in a “partial EMT” phenotype. Carcinoma cells utilizing this program migrate as clusters, contrasting with the single-cell migration pattern associated with traditionally defined EMT mechanisms. Moreover, many breast and colorectal cancer cell lines utilize this alternative program to undergo EMT. Collectively, these results suggest that carcinoma cells have different ways of losing their epithelial program, resulting in distinct modes of invasion and dissemination.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple deadenylases are known in vertebrates, the PAN2-PAN3 (PAN2/3) and CCR4-NOT (CNOT) complexes, and PARN, yet their differential functions remain ambiguous. Moreover, the role of poly(A) binding protein (PABP) is obscure, limiting our understanding of the deadenylation mechanism. Here, we show that CNOT serves as a predominant nonspecific deadenylase for cytoplasmic poly(A)+ RNAs, and PABP promotes deadenylation while preventing premature uridylation and decay. PAN2/3 selectively trims long tails (>∼150 nt) with minimal effect on transcriptome, whereas PARN does not affect mRNA deadenylation. CAF1 and CCR4, catalytic subunits of CNOT, display distinct activities: CAF1 trims naked poly(A) segments and is blocked by PABPC, whereas CCR4 is activated by PABPC to shorten PABPC-protected sequences. Concerted actions of CAF1 and CCR4 delineate the ∼27 nt periodic PABPC footprints along shortening tail. Our study unveils distinct functions of deadenylases and PABPC, re-drawing the view on mRNA deadenylation and regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Th17 cells drive autoimmune disease but also control commensal microbes. A common link among antigens from self-proteins or commensal microbiota is relatively low activation of T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulation signaling. Indeed, strong TCR/CD28 stimulation suppressed Th17 cell differentiation from human naive T cells, but not effector/memory cells. CD28 suppressed the classical Th17 transcriptional program, while inducing known Th17 regulators, and acted through an Akt-dependent mechanism. Th17 cells differentiated without CD28 were not anergic: they showed robust proliferation and maintained Th17 cytokine production following restimulation. Interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-1β promoted glucose uptake and increased glycolysis. Although modestly increased compared to CD28 costimulation, glycolysis was necessary to support Th17 differentiation, indicating that cytokine-mediated metabolic shifts were sufficient to obviate the classical requirement for CD28 in Th17 differentiation. Together, these data propose that, in humans, strength of TCR/CD28/Akt activation serves as a rheostat tuning the magnitude of Th17 development driven by IL-23 and IL-1β.

Abstract: Store Operated Ca2+ Entry (SOCE) mediated by Orai channels is a ubiquitous Ca2+ influx pathway that regulates several cellular functions. We have earlier reported that Orai3, the mammalian specific Orai1 homolog, plays a critical role in breast cancer progression. More recently, Orai3 was demonstrated to regulate prostate and lung tumorigenesis. Although the tumorigenic potential of Orai3 is associated with increase in its expression, the molecular machinery regulating its expression remains largely unexplored. Here, by performing extensive bioinformatics analysis and functional studies, we identify and characterize micro-RNAs (miRNAs) that regulate Orai3 expression and function. We demonstrate that miR18a and miR18b positively regulate Orai3 whereas miR34a represses Orai3 expression and function. All these miRs exert their effect on Orai3 by virtue of their direct action on Orai3 3′UTR. These miRs provide novel opportunities for targeting Orai3 for better management of cancer. This study further opens up the possibility of targeting specific Orai homologs by different miRs in tissue and disease specific context.

Abstract: Summary
C. elegans vulval precursor cell (VPC) fates are patterned by an epidermal growth factor (EGF) gradient. High-dose EGF induces 1° VPC fate, and lower dose EGF contributes to 2° fate in support of LIN-12/Notch. We previously showed that the EGF 2°-promoting signal is mediated by LET-60/Ras switching effectors, from the canonical Raf-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade that promotes 1° fate to the non-canonical RalGEF-Ral that promotes 2° fate. Of oncogenic Ras effectors, RalGEF-Ral is by far the least well understood. We use genetic analysis to identify an effector cascade downstream of C. elegans RAL-1/Ral, starting with an established Ral binding partner, Exo84 of the exocyst complex. Additionally, RAL-1 signals through GCK-2, a citron-N-terminal-homology-domain-containing MAP4 kinase, and PMK-1/p38 MAP kinase cascade to promote 2° fate. Our study delineates a Ral-dependent developmental signaling cascade in vivo, thus providing the mechanism by which lower EGF dose is transduced.

Abstract: Summary
Human studies suggest that a meal elevates glucose uptake in brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, in postprandial state the thermogenic activity and the metabolism of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) in BAT remain unclear. Using indirect calorimetry combined with positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT), we showed that whole-body and BAT thermogenesis (oxygen consumption) increases after the ingestion of a mixed carbohydrate-rich meal, to the same extent as in cold stress. Postprandial NEFA uptake into BAT is minimal, possibly due to elevated plasma insulin inhibiting lipolysis. However, the variation in postprandial NEFA uptake is linked to BAT thermogenesis. We identified several genes participating in lipid metabolism to be expressed at higher levels in BAT compared with white fat in postprandial state, and to be positively correlated with BAT UCP1 expression. These findings suggest that substrates preferred by BAT in postprandial state are glucose or LPL-released NEFAs due to insulin stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic genetic alterations of IKZF1, which encodes the lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS, are common in high-risk B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are associated with poor prognosis. Such alterations result in the acquisition of stem cell-like features, overexpression of adhesion molecules causing aberrant cell-cell and cell-stroma interaction, and decreased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here we report coding germline IKZF1 variation in familial childhood ALL and 0.9% of presumed sporadic B-ALL, identifying 28 unique variants in 45 children. The majority of variants adversely affected IKZF1 function and drug responsiveness of leukemic cells. These results identify IKZF1 as a leukemia predisposition gene, and emphasize the importance of germline genetic variation in the development of both familial and sporadic ALL.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) display a complex spectrum of mutations and chromosomal aberrations. Chromosome 5q (5q) loss is detected in up to 70% of TNBCs, but little is known regarding the genetic drivers associated with this event. Here, we show somatic deletion of a region syntenic with human 5q33.2–35.3 in a mouse model of TNBC. Mechanistically, we identify KIBRA as a major factor contributing to the effects of 5q loss on tumor growth and metastatic progression. Re-expression of KIBRA impairs metastasis in vivo and inhibits tumorsphere formation by TNBC cells in vitro. KIBRA functions co-operatively with the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN14 to trigger mechanotransduction-regulated signals that inhibit the nuclear localization of oncogenic transcriptional co-activators YAP/TAZ. Our results argue that the selective advantage produced by 5q loss involves reduced dosage of KIBRA, promoting oncogenic functioning of YAP/TAZ in TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogen receptor α (ER) ligand-binding domain (LBD) mutations are found in a substantial number of endocrine treatment-resistant metastatic ER-positive (ER+) breast cancers. We investigated the chromatin recruitment, transcriptional network, and genetic vulnerabilities in breast cancer models harboring the clinically relevant ER mutations. These mutants exhibit both ligand-independent functions that mimic estradiol-bound wild-type ER as well as allele-specific neomorphic properties that promote a pro-metastatic phenotype. Analysis of the genome-wide ER binding sites identified mutant ER unique recruitment mediating the allele-specific transcriptional program. Genetic screens identified genes that are essential for the ligand-independent growth driven by the mutants. These studies provide insights into the mechanism of endocrine therapy resistance engendered by ER mutations and potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
KDM6A, an X chromosome-encoded histone demethylase and member of the COMPASS-like complex, is frequently mutated in a broad spectrum of malignancies and contributes to oncogenesis with poorly characterized mechanisms. We found that KDM6A loss induced squamous-like, metastatic pancreatic cancer selectively in females through deregulation of the COMPASS-like complex and aberrant activation of super-enhancers regulating ΔNp63, MYC, and RUNX3 oncogenes. This subtype of tumor developed in males had concomitant loss of UTY and KDM6A, suggesting overlapping roles, and points to largely demethylase independent tumor suppressor functions. We also demonstrate that KDM6A-deficient pancreatic cancer is selectively sensitive to BET inhibitors, which reversed squamous differentiation and restrained tumor growth in vivo, highlighting a therapeutic niche for patient tailored therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and their recognition by histone readers exert crucial functions in eukaryotes. Despite extensive studies, conservation and diversity of histone PTM regulation between animals and plants remain less explored because of a lack of systematic knowledge of histone readers in plants. Based on a high-throughput surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) platform, we report the lab-on-chip profiling of interactions between 204 putative reader domains and 11 types of histone peptides in Arabidopsis thaliana. Eleven reader hits were then chosen for histone combinatorial readout pattern profiling. Systematic analysis of histone PTM recognition in Arabidopsis thaliana reveals that plant and human histone readers share conservation in domain types and recognition mechanisms. The differences in particular histone mark recognition by transcription regulator EML1 and DNA damage repair factor MSH6 indicate plant-specific histone PTMs function in Arabidopsis thaliana acquired during evolution.

Abstract: Summary
The controlled release of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) from promoter-proximal pausing (PPP) sites is critical for transcription elongation in metazoans. We show that the human tumor suppressor BRCA2 interacts with RNAPII to regulate PPP release, thereby preventing unscheduled RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) implicated in genomic instability and carcinogenesis. BRCA2 inactivation by depletion or cancer-causing mutations instigates RNAPII accumulation and R-loop accrual at PPP sites in actively transcribed genes, accompanied by γH2AX formation marking DNA breakage, which is reduced by ERCC4 endonuclease depletion. BRCA2 inactivation decreases RNAPII-associated factor 1 (PAF1) recruitment (which normally promotes RNAPII release) and diminishes H2B Lys120 ubiquitination, impeding nascent RNA synthesis. PAF1 depletion phenocopies, while its overexpression ameliorates, R-loop accumulation after BRCA2 inactivation. Thus, an unrecognized role for BRCA2 in the transition from promoter-proximal pausing to productive elongation via augmented PAF1 recruitment to RNAPII is subverted by disease-causing mutations, provoking R-loop-mediated DNA breakage in BRCA2-deficient cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in PLA2G6 (PARK14) cause neurodegenerative disorders in humans, including autosomal recessive neuroaxonal dystrophy and early-onset parkinsonism. We show that loss of iPLA2-VIA, the fly homolog of PLA2G6, reduces lifespan, impairs synaptic transmission, and causes neurodegeneration. Phospholipases typically hydrolyze glycerol phospholipids, but loss of iPLA2-VIA does not affect the phospholipid composition of brain tissue but rather causes an elevation in ceramides. Reducing ceramides with drugs, including myriocin or desipramine, alleviates lysosomal stress and suppresses neurodegeneration. iPLA2-VIA binds the retromer subunits Vps35 and Vps26 and enhances retromer function to promote protein and lipid recycling. Loss of iPLA2-VIA impairs retromer function, leading to a progressive increase in ceramide. This induces a positive feedback loop that affects membrane fluidity and impairs retromer function and neuronal function. Similar defects are observed upon loss of vps26 or vps35 or overexpression of α-synuclein, indicating that these defects may be common in Parkinson disease.

Comprehensive analysis of the roles of ‘black’ and ‘gray’ clusters in structure and function of rat β-parvalbumin,

Abstract: Recently we found two highly conserved structural motifs in the proteins of the EF-hand calcium binding protein family. These motifs provide a supporting scaffold for the Ca2+ binding loops and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the EF-hand domain. Each structural motif forms a cluster of three amino acids called cluster I (‘black’ cluster) and cluster II (‘grey’ cluster). Cluster I is much more conserved and mostly incorporates aromatic amino acids. In contrast, cluster II includes a mix of aromatic, hydrophobic, and polar amino acids. The ‘black’ and ‘gray’ clusters in rat β-parvalbumin consist of F48, A100, F103 and G61, L64, M87, respectively. In the present work, we sequentially substituted these amino acids residues by Ala, except Ala100, which was substituted by Val. Physical properties of the mutants were studied by circular dichroism, scanning calorimetry, dynamic light scattering, chemical crosslinking, and fluorescent probe methods. The Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding affinities of these mutants were evaluated by intrinsic fluorescence and equilibrium dialysis methods. In spite of a rather complicated pattern of contributions of separate amino acid residues of the ‘black’ and ‘gray’ clusters into maintenance of rat β-parvalbumin structural and functional status, the alanine substitutions in the cluster I cause noticeably more pronounced changes in various structural parameters of proteins, such as hydrodynamic radius of apo-form, thermal stability of Ca2+/Mg2+-loaded forms, and total energy of Ca2+ binding in comparison with the changes caused by amino acid substitutions in the cluster II. These findings were further supported by the outputs of computational analysis of the effects of these mutations on the intrinsic disorder predisposition of rat β-parvalbumin, which also indicated that local intrinsic disorder propensities and the overall levels of predicted disorder were strongly affected by mutations in the cluster I, whereas mutations in cluster II had less pronounced effects. These results demonstrate that amino acids of the cluster I provide more essential contribution to the maintenance of structuraland functional properties of the protein in comparison with the residues of the cluster II.

Abstract: Summary
Diverse cell types can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells by ectopic expression of Oct4 (Pou5f1), Klf4, Sox3, and Myc. Many of these induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) retain memory, in terms of DNA methylation and histone modifications (epigenetic memory), of their cellular origins, and this may bias subsequent differentiation. Neurons are difficult to reprogram, and there has not been a systematic side-by-side characterization of reprogramming efficiency or epigenetic memory across different neuronal subtypes. Here, we compare reprogramming efficiency of five different retinal cell types at two different stages of development. Retinal differentiation from each iPSC line was measured using a quantitative standardized scoring system called STEM-RET and compared to the epigenetic memory. Neurons with the lowest reprogramming efficiency produced iPSC lines with the best retinal differentiation and were more likely to retain epigenetic memory of their cellular origins. In addition, we identified biomarkers of iPSCs that are predictive of retinal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The reduction in the red to far-red light ratio (R/FR) and photosynthetically active radiation caused by dense planting initiates shade avoidance responses (SARs) to help plants compete against their neighbors. However, deep shade attenuates shade-induced stem elongation to suppress excessive reversion toward skotomorphogenic development, in which photoreceptor phytochrome A (PHYA) has been known to play the major role. However, the molecular mechanism underlying PHYA function in deep shade is poorly understood. Here, we report that shade-accumulated PHYA can release auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (AUX/IAA), suppressors in the auxin signaling pathway, from SCFTIR1, an auxin receptor, to weaken auxin signaling and negatively regulate shade response. Corroborating this, phyA mutants display an enhanced auxin response to deep shade and auxin treatment. Specifically, PHYA competes with TIR1 by directly binding and stabilizing AUX/IAA. Our findings illustrate a mechanistic model of how plants sense different shade levels to fine-tune auxin signaling and generate appropriate SAR.

Abstract: Summary
Thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) are one of the rarest adult malignancies. Among TETs, thymoma is the most predominant, characterized by a unique association with autoimmune diseases, followed by thymic carcinoma, which is less common but more clinically aggressive. Using multi-platform omics analyses on 117 TETs, we define four subtypes of these tumors defined by genomic hallmarks and an association with survival and World Health Organization histological subtype. We further demonstrate a marked prevalence of a thymoma-specific mutated oncogene, GTF2I, and explore its biological effects on multi-platform analysis. We further observe enrichment of mutations in HRAS, NRAS, and TP53. Last, we identify a molecular link between thymoma and the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, characterized by tumoral overexpression of muscle autoantigens, and increased aneuploidy.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-to-cell transcriptional variability in otherwise homogeneous cell populations plays an important role in tissue function and development. Single-cell RNA sequencing can characterize this variability in a transcriptome-wide manner. However, technical variation and the confounding between variability and mean expression estimates hinder meaningful comparison of expression variability between cell populations. To address this problem, we introduce an analysis approach that extends the BASiCS statistical framework to derive a residual measure of variability that is not confounded by mean expression. This includes a robust procedure for quantifying technical noise in experiments where technical spike-in molecules are not available. We illustrate how our method provides biological insight into the dynamics of cell-to-cell expression variability, highlighting a synchronization of biosynthetic machinery components in immune cells upon activation. In contrast to the uniform up-regulation of the biosynthetic machinery, CD4+ T cells show heterogeneous up-regulation of immune-related and lineage-defining genes during activation and differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The brain cancer medulloblastoma consists of different transcriptional subgroups. To characterize medulloblastoma at the phosphoprotein-signaling level, we performed high-throughput peptide phosphorylation profiling on a large cohort of SHH (Sonic Hedgehog), group 3, and group 4 medulloblastomas. We identified two major protein-signaling profiles. One profile was associated with rapid death post-recurrence and resembled MYC-like signaling for which MYC lesions are sufficient but not necessary. The second profile showed enrichment for DNA damage, as well as apoptotic and neuronal signaling. Integrative analysis demonstrated that heterogeneous transcriptional input converges on these protein-signaling profiles: all SHH and a subset of group 3 patients exhibited the MYC-like protein-signaling profile; the majority of the other group 3 subset and group 4 patients displayed the DNA damage/apoptotic/neuronal signaling profile. Functional analysis of enriched pathways highlighted cell-cycle progression and protein synthesis as therapeutic targets for MYC-like medulloblastoma.

Abstract: Summary
The canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is a clonally transmissible cancer that regresses spontaneously or after treatment with vincristine, but we know little about the regression mechanisms. We performed global transcriptional, methylation, and functional pathway analyses on serial biopsies of vincristine-treated CTVTs and found that regression occurs in sequential steps; activation of the innate immune system and host epithelial tissue remodeling followed by immune infiltration of the tumor, arrest in the cell cycle, and repair of tissue damage. We identified CCL5 as a possible driver of CTVT regression. Changes in gene expression are associated with methylation changes at specific intragenic sites. Our results underscore the critical role of host innate immunity in triggering cancer regression.

Abstract: Summary
Environmental stress can induce adult reproductive diapause, a state of developmental arrest that temporarily suspends reproduction. Deficiency for C. elegans Piwi protein PRG-1 results in strains that reproduce for many generations but then become sterile. We found that sterile-generation prg-1/Piwi mutants typically displayed pronounced germ cell atrophy as L4 larvae matured into 1-day-old adults. Atrophied germlines spontaneously reproliferated across the first days of adulthood, and this was accompanied by fertility for day 2–4 adults. Sterile day 5 prg-1 mutant adults remained sterile indefinitely, but providing an alternative food source could restore their fertility. Our data imply that late-generation prg-1 mutants experience a dynamic form of adult reproductive diapause, promoted by stress response, cell death, and RNAi pathways, where delayed fertility and reproductive quiescence represent parallel adaptive developmental outcomes. This may occur in response to a form of “heritable stress” that is transmitted by gametes and epigenetic in nature.

Abstract: Summary
To fulfill bioenergetic demands of activation, T cells perform aerobic glycolysis, a process common to highly proliferative cells in which glucose is fermented into lactate rather than oxidized in mitochondria. However, the signaling events that initiate aerobic glycolysis in T cells remain unclear. We show T cell activation rapidly induces glycolysis independent of transcription, translation, CD28, and Akt and not involving increased glucose uptake or activity of glycolytic enzymes. Rather, TCR signaling promotes activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1), inhibiting mitochondrial import of pyruvate and facilitating breakdown into lactate. Inhibition of PDHK1 reveals this switch is required acutely for cytokine synthesis but dispensable for cytotoxicity. Functionally, cytokine synthesis is modulated via lactate dehydrogenase, which represses cytokine mRNA translation when aerobic glycolysis is disengaged. Our data provide mechanistic insight to metabolic contribution to effector T cell function and suggest that T cell function may be finely tuned through modulation of glycolytic activity.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) maintains gene silencing by catalyzing methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me2/3) within chromatin. By designing a system whereby PRC2-mediated repressive domains were collapsed and then reconstructed in an inducible fashion in vivo, a two-step mechanism of H3K27me2/3 domain formation became evident. First, PRC2 is stably recruited by the actions of JARID2 and MTF2 to a limited number of spatially interacting “nucleation sites,” creating H3K27me3-forming Polycomb foci within the nucleus. Second, PRC2 is allosterically activated via its binding to H3K27me3 and rapidly spreads H3K27me2/3 both in cis and in far-cis via long-range contacts. As PRC2 proceeds further from the nucleation sites, its stability on chromatin decreases such that domains of H3K27me3 remain proximal, and those of H3K27me2 distal, to the nucleation sites. This study demonstrates the principles of de novo establishment of PRC2-mediated repressive domains across the genome.
