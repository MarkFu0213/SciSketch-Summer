Abstract: Summary
PARP-3 is a member of the ADP-ribosyl transferase superfamily of unknown function. We show that PARP-3 is stimulated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in vitro and functions in the same pathway as the poly (ADP-ribose)-binding protein APLF to accelerate chromosomal DNA DSB repair. We implicate PARP-3 in the accumulation of APLF at DSBs and demonstrate that APLF promotes the retention of XRCC4/DNA ligase IV complex in chromatin, suggesting that PARP-3 and APLF accelerate DNA ligation during nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). Consistent with this, we show that class switch recombination in Aplf−/− B cells is biased toward microhomology-mediated end-joining, a pathway that operates in the absence of XRCC4/DNA ligase IV, and that the requirement for PARP-3 and APLF for NHEJ is circumvented by overexpression of XRCC4/DNA ligase IV. These data identify molecular roles for PARP-3 and APLF in chromosomal DNA double-strand break repair reactions.

Abstract: Summary
In obesity, adipocytes distant from vasculature become hypoxic and dysfunctional. This hypoxic response is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors (Hif1α, Hif2α, and Hif3α) and their obligate partner, Hif1β (Arnt). We show that mice lacking Hif1β in fat (FH1βKO) are lean, exhibit reduced adipocyte size, and are protected from age- and diet-induced glucose intolerance. There is also reduced Vegf and vascular permeability in FH1βKO fat, but diet-induced inflammation and fibrosis is unchanged. Adipocytes from FH1βKO mice have reduced glucose uptake due to decreased Glut1 and Glut4, which is mirrored in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with Hif1β knockdown. Hif1β knockdown cells also fail to respond appropriately to hypoxia with reduced cellular respiration and reduced mitochondrial gene expression. Some, but not all, of these effects are reproduced by Hif1α knockdown. Thus, Hif1β/Arnt regulates glucose uptake, mitochondrial gene expression, and vascular permeability to control adipose mass and function, providing a target for obesity therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular asymmetry is critical to metazoan development and the life cycle of many microbes. In Caulobacter, cell cycle progression and the formation of asymmetric daughter cells depend on the polarly-localized histidine kinase CckA. How CckA is regulated and why activity depends on localization are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the unorthodox kinase DivL promotes CckA activity and that the phosphorylated regulator DivK inhibits CckA by binding to DivL. Early in the cell cycle, CckA is activated by the dephosphorylation of DivK throughout the cell. However, in later stages, when phosphorylated DivK levels are high, CckA activation relies on polar localization with a DivK phosphatase. Localization thus creates a protected zone for CckA within the cell, without the use of membrane-enclosed compartments. Our results reveal the mechanisms by which CckA is regulated in a cell-type-dependent manner. More generally, our findings reveal how cells exploit subcellular localization to orchestrate sophisticated regulatory processes.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic acinar cells of adult mice (≥P60) are resistant to transformation by some of the most robust oncogenic insults including expression of K-Ras oncogenes and loss of p16Ink4a/p19Arf or Trp53 tumor suppressors. Yet, these acinar cells yield pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (mPanIN) and ductal adenocarcinomas (mPDAC) if exposed to limited bouts of non-acute pancreatitis, providing they harbor K-Ras oncogenes. Pancreatitis contributes to tumor progression by abrogating the senescence barrier characteristic of low-grade mPanINs. Attenuation of pancreatitis-induced inflammation also accelerates tissue repair and thwarts mPanIN expansion. Patients with chronic pancreatitis display senescent PanINs, providing they have received antiinflammatory drugs. These results support the concept that antiinflammatory treatment of people diagnosed with pancreatitis may reduce their risk of developing PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
Tissues that generate specialized cell types in a production line must coordinate developmental mechanisms with physiological demand, although how this occurs is largely unknown. In the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite, the developmental sex-determination cascade specifies gamete sex in the distal germline, while physiological sperm signaling activates MPK-1/ERK in the proximal germline to control plasma membrane biogenesis and organization during oogenesis. We discovered repeated utilization of a self-contained negative regulatory module, consisting of NOS-3 translational repressor, FEM-CUL-2 (E3 ubiquitin ligase), and TRA-1 (Gli transcriptional repressor), which acts both in sex determination and in physiological demand control of oogenesis, coordinating these processes. In the distal germline, where MPK-1 is not activated, TRA-1 represses the male fate as NOS-3 functions in translational repression leading to inactivation of the FEM-CUL-2 ubiquitin ligase. In the proximal germline, sperm-dependent physiological MPK-1 activation results in phosphorylation-based inactivation of NOS-3, FEM-CUL-2-mediated degradation of TRA-1 and the promotion of membrane organization during oogenesis.

Abstract: While natural antimicrobial peptides are potential therapeutic agents, their physicochemical properties and bioactivity generally need to be enhanced for clinical and commercial development. We have previously developed a cationic, amphipathic α-helical, 11-residue peptide (named herein GA-W2: FLGWLFKWASK-NH2) with potent antimicrobial and hemolytic activity, which was derived from a 24-residue, natural antimicrobial peptide isolated from frog skin. Here, we attempted to optimize peptide bioactivity by a rational approach to sequence modification. Seven analogues were generated from GA-W2, and their activities were compared with that of a 12-residue peptide, omiganan, which is being developed for clinical and commercial applications. Most of the modifications reported here improved antimicrobial activity. Among them, the GA-K4AL (FAKWAFKWLKK-NH2) peptide displayed the most potent antimicrobial activity with negligible hemolytic activity, superior to that of omiganan. The therapeutic index of GAK4AL was improved more than 53- and more than 31-fold against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively, compared to that of the starting peptide, GAW2. Given its relatively shorter length and simpler amino acid composition, our sequence-optimized GA-K4AL peptide may thus be a potentially useful antimicrobial peptide agent.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian lipid homeostasis requires proteolytic activation of membrane-bound sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors through sequential action of the Golgi Site-1 and Site-2 proteases. Here we report that while SREBP function is conserved in fungi, fission yeast employs a different mechanism for SREBP cleavage. Using genetics and biochemistry, we identified four genes defective for SREBP cleavage, dsc1-4, encoding components of a transmembrane Golgi E3 ligase complex with structural homology to the Hrd1 E3 ligase complex involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. The Dsc complex binds SREBP and cleavage requires components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc4, the Dsc1 RING E3 ligase, and the proteasome. dsc mutants display conserved aggravating genetic interactions with components of the multivesicular body pathway in fission yeast and budding yeast, which lacks SREBP. Together, these data suggest that the Golgi Dsc E3 ligase complex functions in a post-ER pathway for protein degradation.

Abstract: The establishment of the first human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in 1998 provided a unique tool for studying human development. Although several Western embryo-derived hESC lines are well characterized, the biological properties of Asian embryo-derived hESC lines remain unexamined. The aim of this study was to characterize Korean embryo-derived hESC lines and their differentiation potential. In this context, we conducted microarraybased differential gene expression analyses using two Korean embryo-derived hESc lines (CHA3 and CHA4) to identify undifferentiated and spontaneously differentiated (human embryoid body, or hEB) status. These two cell lines showed great similarity in gene expression. By comparing their expression patterns, we determined novel hESC-specific genes and transcriptomes that could serve as reliable hESC markers associated with the “stemness” phenotype. Additionally, we sought to identify hEB markers that could be used to determine the presence of differentiated cells in specific tissues, allowing for the purification of homogeneous cell populations or serving as indicators of hESC differentiation. Novel sets of 68 hESC-specific markers, 12 hESC-specific transcripts and 36 hEB markers were identified and shown by quantitative RT-PCR to be similarly expressed in CHA3- and CHA4-hESC lines, as compared to the Western embryo-derived H9-hESC line. Furthermore, our data analysis revealed that the cell cycle, urea cycle, p53 signaling, and metabolism of amino groups are significantly implicated in the regulation of hESC differentiation. These results provide another unique set of hESC/hEB markers and foster a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying hESC biology. These results may thus facilitate studies of human developmental events and provide information regarding Korean embryo-derived hESCs, which could be used to determine differences in developmental events between human races.

Abstract: Summary
BRCA1 contributes to the response to UV irradiation. Utilizing its BRCT motifs, it is recruited during S/G2 to UV-damaged sites in a DNA replication-dependent but nucleotide excision repair (NER)-independent manner. More specifically, at UV-stalled replication forks, it promotes photoproduct excision, suppression of translesion synthesis, and the localization and activation of replication factor C complex (RFC) subunits. The last function, in turn, triggers post-UV checkpoint activation and postreplicative repair. These BRCA1 functions differ from those required for DSBR.

Abstract: Systematic searches using the complete genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa) identified OsSUS7, a new member of the rice sucrose synthase (OsSUS) gene family, which shows only nine single nucleotide substitutions in the OsSUS5 coding sequence. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the synteny between OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 is conserved, and that significant numbers of transposable elements are scattered at both loci. In particular, a 17.6-kb genomic region containing transposable elements was identified in the 5′ upstream sequence of the OsSUS7 gene. GFP fusion experiments indicated that OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 are largely associated with the plasma membrane and partly with the cytosol in maize mesophyll protoplasts. RT-PCR analysis and transient expression assays revealed that OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 exhibit similar expression patterns in rice tissues, with the highest expression evident in roots. These results suggest that two redundant genes, OsSUS5 and OsSUS7, evolved via duplication of a chromosome region and through the transposition of transposable elements.

Abstract: Cytoskeleton damage is a frequent feature in neuronal cell death and one of the early events in oxidant-induced cell injury. This work addresses whether actin cytoskeleton reorganization is an early event of SIN-1-induced extracellular nitrosative/oxidative stress in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGN). The actin polymerization state, i.e. the relative levels of G-/F-actin, was quantitatively assessed by the ratio of the fluorescence intensities of microscopy images obtained from CGN double-labelled with Alexa594-DNase-I (for actin monomers) and Bodipy-FL-phallacidin (for actin filaments). Exposure of CGN to a flux of peroxynitrite as low as 0.5–1μM/min during 30min (achieved with 0.1mM SIN-1) was found to promote alterations of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics as it increases the G-actin/F-actin ratio. Because L-type voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (L-VOCC) are primary targets in CGN exposed to SIN-1, the possible role of Ca2+ dynamics on the perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton was also assessed from the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration response to the L-VOCC's agonist FPL-64176 and to the L-VOCC's blocker nifedipine. The results showed that SIN-1 induced changes in the actin polymerization state correlated with its ability to decrease Ca2+ influx through L-VOCC. Combined analysis of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and G-actin/F-actin ratio alterations by SIN-1, cytochalasin D, latrunculin B and jasplakinolide support that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton is linked to cytosolic calcium concentration changes.

Abstract: Summary
Exquisite control of cholesterol synthesis is crucial for maintaining homeostasis of this vital yet potentially toxic lipid. Squalene monooxygenase (SM) catalyzes the first oxygenation step in cholesterol synthesis, acting on squalene before cyclization into the basic steroid structure. Using model cell systems, we found that cholesterol caused the accumulation of the substrate squalene, suggesting that SM may serve as a flux-controlling enzyme beyond 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR, considered as rate limiting). Cholesterol accelerated the proteasomal degradation of SM which required the N-terminal domain, partially conserved in vertebrates but not in lower organisms. Unlike HMGR, SM degradation is not mediated by Insig, 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, or side-chain oxysterols, but rather by cholesterol itself. Importantly, SM's N-terminal domain conferred cholesterol-regulated turnover on heterologous fusion proteins. Furthermore, proteasomal inhibition almost totally eliminated squalene accumulation, highlighting the importance of this degradation mechanism for the control of SM and suggesting this as a possible control point in cholesterol synthesis.

Abstract: Long-term consumption of artificial sweeteners (AS) has been the recent focus of safety concerns. However, the potential risk of the AS in cardiovascular disease and lipoprotein metabolism has not been investigated sufficiently. We compared the influence of AS (aspartame, acesulfame K, and saccharin) and fructose in terms of functional and structural correlations of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), which have atheroprotective effects. Long-term treatment of apoA-I with the sweetener at physiological concentration (3 mM for 168 h) resulted in loss of antioxidant and phospholipid binding activities with modification of secondary structure. The AS treated apoA-I exhibited proteolytic cleavage to produce 26 kDa-fragment. They showed pro-atherogenic properties in acetylated LDL phagocytosis of macrophages. Each sweetener alone or sweetener-treated apoA-I caused accelerated senescence in human dermal fibroblasts. These results suggest that long-term consumption of AS might accelerate atherosclerosis and senescence via impairment of function and structure of apoA-I and HDL.

Abstract: In slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome, point mutations of the endplate acetylcholine receptor (AChR) prolong channel openings, leading to excessive Ca2+ entry with ensuing endplate degeneration and myasthenic symptoms. The Ca2+ permeability of the human endplate AChR-channel is quite high, and is further increased by two slow-channel mutations in its ɛ subunit, worsening the pathological cascade. To gain further support to the hypothesis that the ɛ subunit plays a crucial role in controlling Ca2+ permeability of endplate AChR-channel, in this work we measured the fractional Ca2+ current (Pf, i.e., the percentage of the total current carried by Ca2+ ions) of a panel of AChR carrying slow-channel mutations in the α, β and ɛ subunits detected in patients (αN217K, αS226Y, αC418W, βV266A, βV266M, ɛI257F, ɛV265A and ɛL269F). We confirm that only mutations in the ɛ subunit altered Ca2+ permeability of AChR-channels, with ɛL269F increasing Pf (10% vs. 7% of wild type AChR) and ɛI257F decreasing it (to 4.6%). We also found that, for ɛL269F–AChR, the Ca2+ permeability and ACh-induced cell death can be normalized by clinically relevant concentrations of salbutamol or verapamil, providing the first evidence that the Ca2+ permeability of AChR-channels can be modulated and this treatment may provide protection against excitotoxic insults.

Abstract: LH increases the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in mice Leydig cells, in a process triggered by calcium influx through T-type Ca2+ channels. Here we show that LH modulates both T-type Ca2+ currents and [Ca2+]i transients through the effects of PKA and PKC. LH increases the peak calcium current (at −20mV) by 40%. A similar effect is seen with PMA. The effect of LH is completely blocked by the PKA inhibitors H89 and a synthetic inhibitory peptide (IP-20), but only partially by chelerythrine (PKC inhibitor). LH and the blockers induced only minor changes in the voltage dependence of activation, inactivation or deactivation of the currents. Staurosporine (blocker of PKA and PKC) impaired the [Ca2+]i changes induced by LH. A similar effect was seen with H89. Although PMA slowly increased the [Ca2+]i the subsequent addition of LH still triggered the typical transients in [Ca2+]i. Chelerythrine also does not avoid the Ca2+ transients, showing that blockage of PKC is not sufficient to inhibit the LH induced [Ca2+]i rise. In summary, these two kinases are not only directly involved in promoting testosterone synthesis but also act on the overall calcium dynamics in Leydig cells, mostly through the activation of PKA by LH.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, the PGC-1 transcriptional coactivators are key regulators of energy metabolism, including mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, which have been implicated in numerous pathogenic conditions, including neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy. Here, we show that overexpression of the Drosophila PGC-1 homolog (dPGC-1/spargel) is sufficient to increase mitochondrial activity. Moreover, tissue-specific overexpression of dPGC-1 in stem and progenitor cells within the digestive tract extends life span. Long-lived flies overexpressing dPGC-1 display a delay in the onset of aging-related changes in the intestine, leading to improved tissue homeostasis in old flies. Together, these results demonstrate that dPGC-1 can slow aging both at the level of cellular changes in an individual tissue and also at the organismal level by extending life span. Our findings point to the possibility that alterations in PGC-1 activity in high-turnover tissues, such as the intestine, may be an important determinant of longevity in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are an essential regulatory component in chromatin biology. Unlike A-type HATs, which are found in the nucleus and utilize nucleosomal histones as substrates and thus primarily function in transcriptional regulation, B-type HATs have been characterized as cytoplasmic enzymes that catalyze the acetylation of free histones. Here, we report on a member of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily and another B-type HAT, HAT4. Interestingly, HAT4 is localized in the Golgi apparatus and displays a substrate preference for lysine residues of free histone H4, including H4K79 and H4K91, that reside in the globular domain of H4. Significantly, HAT4 depletion impaired nucleosome assembly, inhibited cell proliferation, sensitized cells to DNA damage, and induced cell apoptosis. Our data indicate that HAT4 is an important player in the organization and function of the genome and may contribute to the diversity and complexity of higher eukaryotic organisms.

Abstract: One aim of this article was to determine the resting concentration of free Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of frog cut skeletal muscle fibers ([Ca2+]SR,R) using the calcium absorbance indicator dye tetramethylmurexide (TMX). Another was to determine the ratio of [Ca2+]SR,R to TMX's apparent dissociation constant for Ca2+ (Kapp) in order to establish the capability of monitoring [Ca2+]SR(t) during SR Ca2+ release – a signal needed to determine the Ca2+ permeability of the SR. To reveal the properties of TMX in the SR, the surface membrane was rapidly permeabilized with saponin to rapidly dissipate myoplasmic TMX. Results indicated that the concentration of Ca-free TMX in the SR was 2.8-fold greater than that in the myoplasm apparently due to binding of TMX to sites in the SR. Taking into account that such binding might influence Kapp as well as a dependence of Kapp on TMX concentration, the results indicate an average [Ca2+]SR,R ranging from 0.43 to 1.70mM. The ratio [Ca2+]SR,R/Kapp averaged 0.256, a relatively low value which should not depend on factors influencing Kapp. As a result, the time course of [Ca2+]SR(t) in response to electrical stimulation is well determined by, and approximately linearly related to, the active TMX absorbance signal.

Abstract: Summary
The sliding clamp is an essential component of the replisome required for processivity of DNA synthesis and several other aspects of chromosome metabolism. However, the in vivo dynamics of the clamp are poorly understood. We have used various biochemical and cell biological methods to study the dynamics of clamp association with the replisome in Bacillus subtilis cells. We find that clamps form large assemblies on DNA, called “clamp zones.” Loading depends on DnaG primase and is probably driven by Okazaki fragment initiation on the lagging strand. Unloading, which is probably regulated, only occurs after many clamps have accumulated on the DNA. On/off cycling allows chromosomal zones of about 200 accumulated clamps to follow the replisome. Since we also show that clamp zones recruit proteins bearing a clamp-binding sequence to replication foci, the results highlight the clamp as a central organizer in the structure and function of replication foci.

Abstract: Summary
Growing evidence suggests that FGFs secreted from embryonic signaling centers are key mediators of cell survival. However, the mechanisms regulating FGF-dependent cell survival remain obscure. At the rostral end of the embryo, for example, ablation of FGF signaling leads to the rapid death of the precursor cells that form the anterior head, including the telencephalon. Here, we outline a core genetic circuit that regulates survival in the embryonic mouse head: WNT signaling through β-catenin directly maintains FGF expression and requires FGF function in vivo to oppose proapoptotic TGF-β signaling through SMAD4. Moreover, these antagonistic pathways converge on the transcriptional regulation of apoptosis, and genes such as Cdkn1a, suggesting a mechanism for how signaling centers in the embryonic head regulate cell survival.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors and associated stroma manifest mechanical properties that promote cancer. Mechanosensation of tissue stiffness activates the Rho/ROCK pathway to increase actomyosin-mediated cellular tension to re-establish force equilibrium. To determine how actomyosin tension affects tissue homeostasis and tumor development, we expressed conditionally active ROCK2 in mouse skin. ROCK activation elevated tissue stiffness via increased collagen. β-catenin, a key element of mechanotranscription pathways, was stabilized by ROCK activation leading to nuclear accumulation, transcriptional activation, and consequent hyperproliferation and skin thickening. Inhibiting actomyosin contractility by blocking LIMK or myosin ATPase attenuated these responses, as did FAK inhibition. Tumor number, growth, and progression were increased by ROCK activation, while ROCK blockade was inhibitory, implicating actomyosin-mediated cellular tension and consequent collagen deposition as significant tumor promoters.

Abstract: Summary
miRNAs are posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression that associate with Argonaute and GW182 proteins to repress translation and/or promote mRNA degradation. miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation is initiated by deadenylation, although it is not known whether deadenylases are recruited to the mRNA target directly or by default, as a consequence of a translational block. To answer this question, we performed a screen for potential interactions between the Argonaute and GW182 proteins and subunits of the two cytoplasmic deadenylase complexes. We found that human GW182 proteins recruit the PAN2-PAN3 and CCR4-CAF1-NOT deadenylase complexes through direct interactions with PAN3 and NOT1, respectively. These interactions are critical for silencing and are conserved in D. melanogaster. Our findings reveal that GW182 proteins provide a docking platform through which deadenylase complexes gain access to the poly(A) tail of miRNA targets to promote their deadenylation, and they further indicate that deadenylation is a direct effect of miRNA regulation.

Abstract: Primary cultures of mouse astrocytes were used to investigate effects by chronic treatment (3–21 days) with fluoxetine (0.5–10μM) on capacitative Ca2+ influx after treatment with the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin and on receptor agonist-induced increases in free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i, determined with Fura-2. The agonists were the 5-HT2B agonist fluoxetine, the α2-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine, and ryanodine receptor (RyR) and IP3 receptor (IP3R) agonists. In untreated sister cultures each agonist distinctly increased [Ca2+]i, but in cultures treated for sufficient length of time or with sufficiently high doses of fluoxetine, acute administration of fluoxetine, dexmedetomidine, or RyR or IP3R agonists elicited reduced, in some cases abolished, effects. Capacitative Ca2+ entry, meditated by TRPC1 channels, was sufficiently inhibited to cause a depletion of Ca2+ stores, which could explain the reduced agonist effects. All effects of chronic fluoxetine administration could be replicated by TRPC1 channel antibody or siRNA. Since increases in astrocytic [Ca2+]i regulate release of gliotransmitters, these effects may have profound effects on brain function. They may be important for therapeutic effects of all 5 conventional ‘serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors’ (SSRIs), which at concentrations used therapeutically (∼1μM) share other of fluoxetine's chronic effects (Zhang et al., Neuron Glia Biol. 16 (2010) 1–13).

Abstract: The karyotype of goral (Nemorhaedus caudatus, 2n = 56) was prepared using lymphocytes and its chromosomal band patterns were compared with those of goat (Caprahircus, 2n = 60) by CBG-, GTG- and RBG-banding techniques. The standard karyotype of goral was composed of 54 acrocentric autosomes, submetacentric X chromosome, and acrocentric Y chromosome. C-bands were prominent in all autosomes except the X chromosome. G- and R-band patterns of goral were dissimilar to those of goat. The data support the idea that the goral did not originate from a common ancestor of bovid, or that there were numerous complicated chromosomal interchanges during goral evolution, in contrast to other bovids.

Abstract: Summary
The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) confers transcriptional repression through histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Here, we examined how PRC2 is modulated by histone modifications associated with transcriptionally active chromatin. We provide the molecular basis of histone H3 N terminus recognition by the PRC2 Nurf55-Su(z)12 submodule. Binding of H3 is lost if lysine 4 in H3 is trimethylated. We find that H3K4me3 inhibits PRC2 activity in an allosteric fashion assisted by the Su(z)12 C terminus. In addition to H3K4me3, PRC2 is inhibited by H3K36me2/3 (i.e., both H3K36me2 and H3K36me3). Direct PRC2 inhibition by H3K4me3 and H3K36me2/3 active marks is conserved in humans, mouse, and fly, rendering transcriptionally active chromatin refractory to PRC2 H3K27 trimethylation. While inhibition is present in plant PRC2, it can be modulated through exchange of the Su(z)12 subunit. Inhibition by active chromatin marks, coupled to stimulation by transcriptionally repressive H3K27me3, enables PRC2 to autonomously template repressive H3K27me3 without overwriting active chromatin domains.

Abstract: In Drosophila, the gustatory receptor (Gr) gene family contains 60 family members that encode 68 proteins through alternative splicing. Some gustatory receptors (Grs) are involved in the sensing of sugars, bitter substrates, CO2, pheromones, and light. Here, we systematically examined the expression of all 68 Grs in abdominal neurons which project to the abdominal ganglion of the central nervous system using the GAL4/UAS system. Gr gene expression patterns have been successfully analyzed in previous studies by using the GAL4/UAS system to drive reporter gene expression. Interestingly, 21 Gr-GAL4 drivers showed abdominal ganglion projection, and 18 of these 21 Gr-GAL4 drivers labeled multidendritic neurons of the abdominal wall. 4 drivers also labeled neuronal processes innervating the reproductive organs. The peripheral expression of Gr-GAL4 drivers in abdominal multidendritic neurons or neurons innervating the reproductive organs suggests that these Grs have atypical sensory functions in these organs not limited to conventional taste sensing.

Abstract: Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control the tissue culture response in soybean were detected by using 184 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from two varieties: Kefeng No.1 and Nannong 1138-2. The molecular map consisting of 834 molecular markers using this population covered space 2307.83 cM of the genome throughout 24 linkage groups. The performance of tissue culture in soybean was evaluated by two indices: callus induction frequency (CIF) and somatic embryos initiation frequency (SEIF). They were expressed as the number of explants producing callus/ the number of total explants and the number of explants producing somatic embryos/ the number of total explants, respectively. The RIL lines showed continuous segregation for both indices. With the composite interval mapping (CIM) described in Windows QTL Cartographer Version 2.5, three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified for the frequency of callus induction, on chromosomes B2 and D2, accounting for phenotypic variation from 5.84% to 16.60%; four QTLs on chromosome G were detected for the frequency of somatic embryos initiation and explained the phenotypic variation from 7.79% to 14.16%. The information of new QTLs identified in the present study will contribute to genetic improvement of regeneration traits with marker-assisted selection (MAS) in soybean.

Abstract: The four cephalic sensilla sheath (CEPsh) glial cells are important for development of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans. Whether these invertebrate glia can generate intracellular Ca2+ increases, a hallmark of mammalian glial cell excitability, is not known. To address this issue, we developed a transgenic worm with the specific co-expression of genetically encoded red fluorescent protein and green Ca2+ sensor in CEPsh glial cells. This allowed us to identify CEPsh cells in culture and monitor their Ca2+ dynamics. We show that CEPsh glial cells, in response to depolarization, generate various intracellular Ca2+ increases mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). Using a pharmacological approach, we find that the L-type is the preponderant VGCC type mediating Ca2+ dynamics. Additionally, using a genetic approach we demonstrate that mutations in three known VGCC α1-subunit genes, cca-1, egl-19 and unc-2, can affect Ca2+ dynamics of CEPsh glial cells. We suggest that VGCC-mediated Ca2+ dynamics in the CEPsh glial cells are complex and display heterogeneity. These findings will aid understanding of how CEPsh glial cells contribute to the operation of the C. elegans nervous system.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic chromosome maintenance requires telomeric repeat synthesis by telomerase. It remains uncertain how telomerase domains interact to organize the active RNP and how this architecture establishes the specificity of the catalytic cycle. We combine human telomerase reconstitutions in vivo, affinity purifications, and discriminating activity assays to uncover a network of protein-protein and protein-RNA domain interactions. Notably, we find that complete single-repeat synthesis requires only a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) core. Single-repeat synthesis does not require the TERT N-terminal (TEN) domain, but RNA-dependent positioning of the TEN domain captures substrate and allows repeat synthesis processivity. A TEN domain physically separate from the TERT core can capture even a minimal template-paired DNA substrate, with substrate association enhanced by the presence of a 5′ single-stranded extension. Our results provide insights into active enzyme architecture, explain biological variations of the catalytic cycle, and predict altered activities for TERT proteins of some eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
MITOPLD is a member of the phospholipase D superfamily proteins conserved among diverse species. Zucchini (Zuc), the Drosophila homolog of MITOPLD, has been implicated in primary biogenesis of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). By contrast, MITOPLD has been shown to hydrolyze cardiolipin in the outer membrane of mitochondria to generate phosphatidic acid, which is a signaling molecule. To assess whether the mammalian MITOPLD is involved in piRNA biogenesis, we generated Mitopld mutant mice. The mice display meiotic arrest during spermatogenesis, demethylation and derepression of retrotransposons, and defects in primary piRNA biogenesis. Furthermore, in mutant germ cells, mitochondria and the components of the nuage, a perinuclear structure involved in piRNA biogenesis/function, are mislocalized to regions around the centrosome, suggesting that MITOPLD may be involved in microtubule-dependent localization of mitochondria and these proteins. Our results indicate a conserved role for MITOPLD/Zuc in the piRNA pathway and link mitochondrial membrane metabolism/signaling to small RNA biogenesis.

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are a major component of blood clots, which form physiologically as a response to injury or pathologically in thrombosis. The active participation of RBCs in thrombus solidification has been previously proposed but not yet experimentally proven. Holographic optical tweezers and single-cell force spectroscopy were used to study potential cell–cell adhesion between RBCs. Irreversible intercellular adhesion of RBCs could be induced by stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a compound known to be released by activated platelets. We identified Ca2+ as an essential player in the signaling cascade by directly inducing Ca2+ influx using A23187. Elevation of the internal Ca2+ concentration leads to an intercellular adhesion of RBCs similar to that induced by LPA stimulation. Using single-cell force spectroscopy, the adhesion of the RBCs was identified to be approximately 100pN, a value large enough to be of significance inside a blood clot or in pathological situations like the vasco-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease patients.

Abstract: Summary
The hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) is the neurovascular structure through which the hypothalamic neuropeptides oxytocin and arginine-vasopressin exit the brain into the bloodstream, where they go on to affect peripheral physiology. Here, we investigate the molecular cues that regulate the neurovascular contact between hypothalamic axons and neurohypophyseal capillaries of the zebrafish. We developed a transgenic system in which both hypothalamic axons and neurohypophyseal vasculature can be analyzed in vivo. We identified the cellular organization of the zebrafish HNS as well as the dynamic processes that contribute to formation of the HNS neurovascular interface. We show that formation of this interface is regulated during development by local release of oxytocin, which affects endothelial morphogenesis. This cell communication process is essential for the establishment of a tight axovasal interface between the neurons and blood vessels of the HNS. We present a unique example of axons affecting endothelial morphogenesis through secretion of a neuropeptide.

Abstract: In blood vessels, stimulation of the vascular endothelium by the Ca2+-mobilizing agonist ATP initiates a number of cellular events that cause relaxation of the adjacent smooth muscle layer. Although vascular endothelial cells are reported to express several subtypes of purinergic P2Y and P2X receptors, the major isoform(s) responsible for the ATP-induced generation of vasorelaxant signals in human endothelium has not been well characterized. To address this issue, ATP-evoked changes in cytosolic Ca2+, membrane potential and acute nitric oxide production were measured in isolated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and profiled using established P2X and P2Y receptor probes. Whereas selective P2X agonist (i.e. α,β-methyl ATP) and antagonists (i.e. TNP-ATP and PPADS) could neither mimic nor block the observed ATP-evoked cellular responses, the specific P2Y receptor agonist UTP functionally reproduced all the ATP-stimulated effects. Furthermore, both ATP and UTP induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization with comparable EC50 values (i.e. 1–3μM). Collectively, these functional and pharmacological profiles strongly suggest that ATP acts primarily via a P2Y2 receptor sub-type in human endothelial cells. In support, P2Y2 receptor mRNA and protein were readily detected in isolated HUVECs, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous P2Y2 receptor protein significantly blunted the cytosolic Ca2+ elevations in response to ATP and UTP, but did not affect the histamine-evoked response. In summary, these results identify the P2Y2 isoform as the major purinergic receptor in human vascular endothelial cells that mediates the cellular actions of ATP linked to vasorelaxation.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired insulin secretion contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Treatment with the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) potentiates insulin secretion and improves metabolic control in humans with T2DM. GLP-1 receptor-mediated signaling leading to insulin secretion occurs via cyclic AMP stimulated protein kinase A (PKA)- as well as guanine nucleotide exchange factor-mediated pathways. However, how these two pathways integrate and coordinate insulin secretion remains poorly understood. Here we show that these incretin-stimulated pathways converge at the level of snapin, and that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of snapin increases interaction among insulin secretory vesicle-associated proteins, thereby potentiating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). In diabetic islets with impaired GSIS, snapin phosphorylation is reduced, and expression of a snapin mutant, which mimics site-specific phosphorylation, restores GSIS. Thus, snapin is a critical node in GSIS regulation and provides a potential therapeutic target to improve β cell function in T2DM.

Abstract: Plasma membrane (PM) Na+, K+-ATPase, plays crucial roles in numerous physiological processes. Cardiac steroids (CS), such as ouabain and bufalin, specifically bind to the Na+, K+-ATPase and affect ionic homeostasis, signal transduction, and endocytosed membrane traffic. CS-like compounds, synthesized in and released from the adrenal gland, are considered a new family of steroid hormones. Previous studies showed that ouabain induces slow Ca2+ oscillations in COS-7 cells by enhancing the interactions between Na+, K+-ATPase, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and Ankyrin B (Ank-B) to form a Ca2+ signaling micro-domain. The activation of this micro-domain, however, is independent of InsP3 generation. Thus, the mechanism underlying the induction of these slow Ca2+ oscillations remained largely unclear. We now show that other CS, such as bufalin, can also induce Ca2+ oscillations. These oscillations depend on extracellular Ca2+ concentrations [Ca2+]out and are inhibited by Ni2+. Furthermore, we found that these slow oscillations are Na+out dependent, abolished by Na+/Ca2+ exchanger1 (NCX1)-specific inhibitors and markedly attenuated by NCX1 siRNA knockdown. Based on these results, a model is presented for the CS-induced slow Ca2+ oscillations in COS-7 cells.

Abstract: Summary
DEPTOR, an inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2, is degraded via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by an unknown E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here we report that DEPTOR is a physiological substrate of SCFβTrCP E3 ligase for targeted degradation. Upon growth factor stimulation, RSK1 and S6K1 kinases are activated to phosphorylate DEPTOR, which is then recognized by the F box protein, βTrCP, via its degron sequence for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation by SCF E3. Endogenous DEPTOR levels are negatively regulated by βTrCP. DEPTOR half-life is shortened by βTrCP but extended by a dominant-negative mutant of βTrCP, by RSK1/S6K1 inhibition, and by βTrCP degron site mutations. Biologically, DEPTOR accumulation upon βTrCP knockdown inactivates mTORC1 and activates AKT in cancer cells to confer resistance to rapamycin and paclitaxel. Furthermore, DEPTOR accumulates upon glucose deprivation and mTOR inhibition to induce autophagy. Thus, βTrCP-DEPTOR-mTOR intertwine to regulate cell survival and autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to a proangiogenic/immune-suppressive (M2-like) phenotype and abnormal, hypoperfused vessels are hallmarks of malignancy, but their molecular basis and interrelationship remains enigmatic. We report that the host-produced histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, while improving chemotherapy. By skewing TAM polarization away from the M2- to a tumor-inhibiting M1-like phenotype, HRG promotes antitumor immune responses and vessel normalization, effects known to decrease tumor growth and metastasis and to enhance chemotherapy. Skewing of TAM polarization by HRG relies substantially on downregulation of placental growth factor (PlGF). Besides unveiling an important role for TAM polarization in tumor vessel abnormalization, and its regulation by HRG/PlGF, these findings offer therapeutic opportunities for anticancer and antiangiogenic treatment.

Abstract: Autophagy and endocytic pathway are highly regulated catabolic processes. Both processes are crucial for cell growth, development, differentiation, disease and homeostasis and exhibit membrane rearrangement for their function. Autophagy and endocytic pathway represent branches of the lysosomal digestive system, autophagy being responsible for degradation of cytoplasmic components and endocytic pathway for degradation of exogenous substances. Here we report that autophagy is activated when endocytic pathway regulatory genes such as rab-5 and rabx-5 are disrupted. Defects in the ubiquitin binding domain of RABX-5 are critical in activating autophagy. We also observed that the elevated autophagy level does not contribute to lifespan extension of rabx-5 mutant. Our results suggest that autophagy may compensate for the endocytic pathway when regulatory genes for the endocytic pathway malfunction, providing a case of complementation between two functionally related cellular processes.

Abstract: Synaptosomal expression of NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3, the three variants of the Na+–Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), was investigated in Alzheimer's disease parietal cortex. Flow cytometry and immunoblotting techniques were used to analyze synaptosomes prepared from cryopreserved brain of cognitively normal aged controls and late stage Alzheimer's disease patients. Major findings that emerged from this study are: (1) NCX1 was the most abundant NCX isoform in nerve terminals of cognitively normal patients; (2) NCX2 and NCX3 protein levels were modulated in parietal cortex of late stage Alzheimer's disease: NCX2 positive terminals were increased in the Alzheimer's disease cohort while counts of NCX3 positive terminals were reduced; (3) NCX1, NCX2 and NCX3 isoforms co-localized with amyloid-beta in synaptic terminals and all three variants are up-regulated in nerve terminals containing amyloid-beta. Taken together, these data indicate that NCX isoforms are selectively regulated in pathological terminals, suggesting different roles of each NCX isoform in Alzheimer's disease terminals.

Abstract: Liberation of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) is modulated by the ER Ca2+ content, and overexpression of SERCA2b to accelerate Ca2+ sequestration into the ER has been shown to potentiate the frequency and amplitude of IP3-evoked Ca2+ waves in Xenopus oocytes. Here, we examined the effects of SERCA overexpression on the elementary IP3-evoked puffs to elucidate whether ER [Ca2+] may modulate IP3R function via luminal regulatory sites in addition to simply determining the size of the available store and electrochemical driving force for Ca2+ release. SERCA2b and Ca2+ permeable nicotinic plasmalemmal channels were expressed in oocytes, and hyperpolarizing pulses were delivered to induce Ca2+ influx and thereby load ER stores. Puffs evoked by photoreleased IP3 were significantly potentiated in terms of numbers of responding sites, frequency and amplitude following transient Ca2+ influx in SERCA-overexpressing cells, whereas little change was evident with SERCA overexpression alone or following Ca2+ influx in control cells not overexpressing SERCA. Intriguingly, we observed the appearance of a new population of puffs that arose after long latencies and had prolonged durations supporting the notion of luminal regulation of IP3R gating kinetics.

Abstract: Ion channels involved in the migration of tumor cells that is required for their invasion and metastasis. In this paper, we describe the interaction of TRPM7 channel and epidermal growth factor (EGF), an important player in cancer development in the migration of lung cancer cells. The TRPM7 currents in A549 cells were first characterized by means of electrophysiology, pharmacology and RNA interference. Removing Ca2+ from the extracellular solution not only potentiated a large inward current, but also abolished the outward rectification. 200μM 2-APB inhibited the outward and the inward TRPM7 currents and at the same time restored the property of outward rectification. EGF greatly enhanced the migration of A549 cells, and also markedly up-regulated the membrane protein expression of TRPM7 and the amplitude of TRPM7 currents. Depressing the function of TRPM7 with RNA interference or pharmacological agents not only reversed the EGF-enhanced migration of A549 cells but also inhibited the basal migration of A549 cells in the absence of EGF. Thus it seems that TRPM7 plays a pivotal role in the migration of A549 cells induced by EGF and thus could be a potential therapeutic target in lung cancers.

Abstract: Summary
The R-Spondin (Rspo) family of secreted Wnt modulators is involved in development and disease and holds therapeutic promise as stem cell growth factors. Despite growing biological importance, their mechanism of action is poorly understood. Here, we show that Rspo3 binds syndecan 4 (Sdc4) and that together they activate Wnt/PCP signaling. In Xenopus embryos, Sdc4 and Rspo3 are essential for two Wnt/PCP-driven processes—gastrulation movements and head cartilage morphogenesis. Rspo3/PCP signaling during gastrulation requires Wnt5a and is transduced via Fz7, Dvl, and JNK. Rspo3 functions by inducing Sdc4-dependent, clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We show that this internalization is essential for PCP signal transduction, suggesting that endocytosis of Wnt-receptor complexes is a key mechanism by which R-spondins promote Wnt signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the PTEN, TP53, and RB1 pathways are obligate events in the pathogenesis of human glioblastomas. We induced various combinations of deletions in these tumor suppressors in astrocytes and neural precursors in mature mice, resulting in astrocytomas ranging from grade III to grade IV (glioblastoma). There was selection for mutation of multiple genes within a pathway, shown by somatic amplifications of genes in the PI3K or Rb pathway in tumors in which Pten or Rb deletion was an initiating event. Despite multiple mutations within PI3K and Rb pathways, elevated Mapk activation was not consistent. Gene expression profiling revealed striking similarities to subclasses of human diffuse astrocytoma. Astrocytomas were found within and outside of proliferative niches in the adult brain.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria regulate the assimilation of multiple nutrients to enable growth. How is balanced utilization achieved, despite fluctuations in the concentrations of the enzymes that make up the regulatory circuitry? Here we address this question by studying the nitrogen system of E. coli. A mechanism based on the avidity of a bifunctional enzyme, adenylyltransferase (AT/AR), to its multimeric substrate, glutamine synthetase, is proposed to maintain a robust ratio between two key metabolites, glutamine and α-ketoglutarate. This ratio is predicted to be insensitive to variations in protein levels of the core circuit and to the rate of nitrogen utilization. We find using mass spectrometry that the metabolite ratio is robust to variations in protein levels and that this robustness depends on the bifunctional enzyme. Moreover, robustness carries through to the bacteria growth rate. Interrupting avidity by adding a monofunctional AT/AR mutant to the native system abolishes robustness, as predicted by the proposed mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence suggests that protein acetylation is a broad-ranging regulatory mechanism. Here we utilize acetyl-peptide arrays and metabolomic analyses to identify substrates of mitochondrial deacetylase Sirt3. We identified ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) from the urea cycle, and enzymes involved in β-oxidation. Metabolomic analyses of fasted mice lacking Sirt3 (sirt3−/−) revealed alterations in β-oxidation and the urea cycle. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that Sirt3 directly deacetylates OTC and stimulates its activity. Mice under caloric restriction (CR) increased Sirt3 protein levels, leading to deacetylation and stimulation of OTC activity. In contrast, sirt3−/− mice failed to deacetylate OTC in response to CR. Inability to stimulate OTC under CR led to a failure to reduce orotic acid levels, a known outcome of OTC deficiency. Thus, Sirt3 directly regulates OTC activity and promotes the urea cycle during CR, and the results suggest that under low energy input, Sirt3 modulates mitochondria by promoting amino acid catabolism and β-oxidation.

Abstract: The ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA) proteins are widespread in living organisms. Some of the AAA-type ATPases possess metalloprotease activities. Other members constitute the 26S proteasome complexes. In recent years, a few AAA members have been implicated in vesicle-mediated secretion, membrane fusion, cellular organelle biogenesis, and hypersensitive responses (HR) in plants. However, the physiological roles and biochemical activities of plant AAA proteins have not yet been defined at the molecular level, and regulatory mechanisms underlying their functions are largely unknown. In this study, we showed that overexpression of an Arabidopsis gene encoding a mitochondrial AAA protein, ATPase-in-Seed-Development (ASD), induces morphological and anatomical defects in seed maturation. The ASD gene is expressed at a high level during the seed maturation process and in mature seeds but is repressed rapidly in germinating seeds. Transgenic plants overexpressing the ASD gene are morphologically normal. However, seed formation is severely disrupted in the transgenic plants. The ASD gene is induced by abiotic stresses, such as low temperatures and high salinity, in an abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent manner. The ASD protein possesses ATPase activity and is localized into the mitochondria. Our observations suggest that ASD may play a role in seed maturation by influencing mitochondrial function under abiotic stress.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor inflammation promotes angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and tumor growth, but the mechanisms controlling inflammatory cell recruitment to tumors are not well understood. We found that a range of chemoattractants activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and Toll-like/IL-1 receptors (TLR/IL1Rs) unexpectedly initiate tumor inflammation by activating the PI3-kinase isoform p110γ in Gr1+CD11b+ myeloid cells. Whereas GPCRs activate p110γ in a Ras/p101-dependent manner, RTKs and TLR/IL1Rs directly activate p110γ in a Ras/p87-dependent manner. Once activated, p110γ promotes inside-out activation of a single integrin, α4β1, causing myeloid cell invasion into tumors. Pharmacological or genetic blockade of p110γ suppressed inflammation, growth, and metastasis of implanted and spontaneous tumors, revealing an important therapeutic target in oncology.

Abstract: Bone marrow-derived cells have been postulated as a source of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). However, the whole fraction of MSC remains heterogeneous and the expansion of primitive subset of these cells is still not well established. Here, we optimized the protocol for propagating the low-adherent subfraction of MSC which results in long-term expansion of population characterized by CD45-CD14+CD34+ phenotype along with expression of common MSC markers. We established that the expanded MSC are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells highly expressing angiogenic markers and exhibiting functional properties of endothelium. Moreover, we found these cells to be multipotent and capable of giving rise into cells from neuronal lineages. Interestingly, the expanded MSC form characteristic cellular spheres in vitro indicating primitive features of these cells. In sum, we isolated the novel multipotent subpopulation of CD45-CD14+CD34+ bone marrow-derived cells that could be maintained in long-term culture without losing this potential.

Abstract: Summary
PPARγ and Wnt signaling are central positive and negative regulators of adipogenesis, respectively. Here we identify the groucho family member TLE3 as a transcriptional integrator of the PPARγ and Wnt pathways. TLE3 is a direct target of PPARγ that participates in a feed-forward loop during adipocyte differentiation. TLE3 enhances PPARγ activity and functions synergistically with PPARγ on its target promoters to stimulate adipogenesis. At the same time, induction of TLE3 during differentiation provides a mechanism for termination of Wnt signaling. TLE3 antagonizes TCF4 activation by β-catenin in preadipocytes, thereby inhibiting Wnt target gene expression and reversing β-catenin-dependent repression of adipocyte gene expression. Transgenic expression of TLE3 in adipose tissue in vivo mimics the effects of PPARγ agonist and ameliorates high-fat-diet-induced insulin resistance. Our data suggest that TLE3 acts as a dual-function switch, driving the formation of both active and repressive transcriptional complexes that facilitate the adipogenic program.

Abstract: Summary
Here we show that yeast strains with reduced target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling have greater overall mitochondrial electron transport chain activity during growth that is efficiently coupled to ATP production. This metabolic alteration increases mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which we propose supplies an adaptive signal during growth that extends chronological life span (CLS). In strong support of this concept, uncoupling respiration during growth or increasing expression of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase significantly curtails CLS extension in tor1Δ strains, and treatment of wild-type strains with either rapamycin (to inhibit TORC1) or menadione (to generate mitochondrial ROS) during growth is sufficient to extend CLS. Finally, extension of CLS by reduced TORC1/Sch9p-mitochondrial signaling occurs independently of Rim15p and is not a function of changes in media acidification/composition. Considering the conservation of TOR-pathway effects on life span, mitochondrial ROS signaling may be an important mechanism of longevity regulation in higher organisms.

Abstract: Alterations in liver functions are common among diabetic patients, and many symptoms in the liver have been reported, including changes in glycogen stores and in the amount of collagen fibers. The practice of physical training and its morphological effects in this organ, however, are scarcely studied. In order to observe the morphological effects of alloxan-induced diabetes and the alterations arising from the practice of long-term chronic physical training in the liver, samples were collected and processed, and then analyzed by means of the histochemical techniques Periodic Acid-Schiff and Picrosirius-Hematoxylin, and ultrastructural cytochemical test of Afzelius. Through evaluation of the tissue, it was observed a drastic reduction in hepatic glycogen stores of sedentary diabetics, recovered in trained diabetic rats. Furthermore, it was detected a decrease in the content of perisinusoidal collagen fibers in the diabetic liver, also recovered due to the development of a training protocol. On ultrastructural level, cytochemical analysis confirmed the loss of glycogen and the recovery obtained by training. In conclusion, the practice of a long-term chronic physical training protocol may be considered an important assistant in the treatment of diabetes, mitigating the occurrence of possible damages to liver tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Precise control of mitochondrial DNA gene expression is critical for regulation of oxidative phosphorylation capacity in mammals. The MTERF protein family plays a key role in this process, and its members have been implicated in regulation of transcription initiation and site-specific transcription termination. We now demonstrate that a member of this family, MTERF4, directly controls mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis and translation. MTERF4 forms a stoichiometric complex with the ribosomal RNA methyltransferase NSUN4 and is necessary for recruitment of this factor to the large ribosomal subunit. Loss of MTERF4 leads to defective ribosomal assembly and a drastic reduction in translation. Our results thus show that MTERF4 is an important regulator of translation in mammalian mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or to excessive energy intake; stimulation of brown fat development and function may thus counteract obesity. Brown adipogenesis requires activation of the transcription factor C/EBPβ and recruitment of the zinc finger protein Prdm16, but upstream inducers of these proteins are incompletely defined. Here, we show that genetic inactivation of Plac8, a gene encoding an evolutionarily conserved protein, induces cold intolerance, and late-onset obesity, as well as abnormal morphology and impaired function of brown adipocytes. Using brown preadipocyte lines we show that Plac8 is required for brown fat differentiation, that its overexpression induces C/EBPβ and Prdm16, and that upon induction of differentiation Plac8 associates with C/EBPβ and binds to the C/EBPβ promoter to induce its transcription. Thus, Plac8 is a critical upstream regulator of brown fat differentiation and function that acts, at least in part, by inducing C/EBPβ expression.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate genome segregation depends on cohesion mechanisms that link duplicated sister chromatids, thereby allowing their tension-dependent biorientation in metaphase. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cohesion is established during DNA replication when Eco1 acetylates the cohesin subunit Smc3. Cohesion establishment is restricted to S phase of the cell cycle, but the molecular basis of this regulation is unknown. Here, we show that Eco1 is negatively regulated by the protein kinase Cdk1. Phosphorylation of Eco1 after S phase targets it to SCFCdc4 for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. A nonphosphorylatable mutant of Eco1 establishes cohesion after DNA replication, suggesting that Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of Eco1 is a key factor limiting establishment to S phase. We also show that deregulation of Eco1 results in chromosome separation defects in anaphase. We conclude that this regulatory mechanism helps optimize the level of sister chromatid cohesion, ensuring a robust and efficient anaphase.

Using a mammary chimera model in which an irradiated host is transplanted with oncogenic Trp53 null epithelium, we show accelerated development of aggressive tumors whose molecular signatures were distinct from tumors arising in nonirradiated hosts. Molecular and genetic approaches show that TGFβ mediated tumor acceleration. Tumor molecular signatures implicated TGFβ, and genetically reducing TGFβ abrogated the effect on latency. Surprisingly, tumors from irradiated hosts were predominantly estrogen receptor negative. This effect was TGFβ independent and linked to mammary stem cell activity. Thus, the irradiated microenvironment affects latency and clinically relevant features of cancer through distinct and unexpected mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
How type I skeletal muscle inherently maintains high oxidative and vascular capacity in the absence of exercise is unclear. We show that nuclear receptor ERRγ is highly expressed in type I muscle and, when transgenically expressed in anaerobic type II muscles (ERRGO mice), dually induces metabolic and vascular transformation in the absence of exercise. ERRGO mice show increased expression of genes promoting fat metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and type I fiber specification. Muscles in ERRGO mice also display an activated angiogenic program marked by myofibrillar induction and secretion of proangiogenic factors, neovascularization, and a 100% increase in running endurance. Surprisingly, the induction of type I muscle properties by ERRγ does not involve PGC-1α. Instead, ERRγ genetically activates the energy sensor AMPK in mediating the metabovascular changes in ERRGO mice. Therefore, ERRγ represents a previously unrecognized determinant that specifies intrinsic vascular and oxidative metabolic features that distinguish type I from type II muscle.

Abstract: Smooth muscle contraction is regulated by changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). In response to stimulation, Ca2+ increase in a single cell can propagate to neighbouring cells through gap junctions, as intercellular Ca2+ waves. To investigate the mechanisms underlying Ca2+ wave propagation between smooth muscle cells, we used primary cultured rat mesenteric smooth muscle cells (pSMCs). Cells were aligned with the microcontact printing technique and a single pSMC was locally stimulated by mechanical stimulation or by microejection of KCl. Mechanical stimulation evoked two distinct Ca2+ waves: (1) a fast wave (2mm/s) that propagated to all neighbouring cells, and (2) a slow wave (20μm/s) that was spatially limited in propagation. KCl induced only fast Ca2+ waves of the same velocity as the mechanically induced fast waves. Inhibition of gap junctions, voltage-operated calcium channels, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and ryanodine receptors, shows that the fast wave was due to gap junction mediated membrane depolarization and subsequent Ca2+ influx through voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, whereas, the slow wave was due to Ca2+ release primarily through IP3 receptors. Altogether, these results indicate that temporally and spatially distinct mechanisms allow intercellular communication between SMCs. In intact arteries this may allow fine tuning of vessel tone.

Abstract: Summary
We screened 124 genes that are amplified in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a mouse hepatoblast model and identified 18 tumor-promoting genes, including CCND1 and its neighbor on 11q13.3, FGF19. Although it is widely assumed that CCND1 is the main driving oncogene of this common amplicon (15% frequency in HCC), both forward-transformation assays and RNAi-mediated inhibition in human HCC cells established that FGF19 is an equally important driver gene in HCC. Furthermore, clonal growth and tumorigenicity of HCC cells harboring the 11q13.3 amplicon were selectively inhibited by RNAi-mediated knockdown of CCND1 or FGF19, as well as by an anti-FGF19 antibody. These results show that 11q13.3 amplification could be an effective biomarker for patients most likely to respond to anti-FGF19 therapy.

Abstract: Summary
High-grade gliomas are notoriously insensitive to radiation and genotoxic drugs. Paradoxically, the p53 gene is structurally intact in the majority of these tumors. Resistance to genotoxic modalities in p53-positive gliomas is generally attributed to attenuation of p53 functions by mutations of other components within the p53 signaling axis, such as p14Arf, MDM2, and ATM, but this explanation is not entirely satisfactory. We show here that the central nervous system (CNS)-restricted transcription factor Olig2 affects a key posttranslational modification of p53 in both normal and malignant neural progenitors and thereby antagonizes the interaction of p53 with promoter elements of multiple target genes. In the absence of Olig2 function, even attenuated levels of p53 are adequate for biological responses to genotoxic damage.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogens regulate body weight and reproduction primarily through actions on estrogen receptor-α (ERα). However, ERα-expressing cells mediating these effects are not identified. We demonstrate that brain-specific deletion of ERα in female mice causes abdominal obesity stemming from both hyperphagia and hypometabolism. Hypometabolism and abdominal obesity, but not hyperphagia, are recapitulated in female mice lacking ERα in hypothalamic steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) neurons. In contrast, deletion of ERα in hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons leads to hyperphagia, without directly influencing energy expenditure or fat distribution. Further, simultaneous deletion of ERα from both SF1 and POMC neurons causes hypometabolism, hyperphagia, and increased visceral adiposity. Additionally, female mice lacking ERα in SF1 neurons develop anovulation and infertility, while POMC-specific deletion of ERα inhibits negative feedback regulation of estrogens and impairs fertility in females. These results indicate that estrogens act on distinct hypothalamic ERα neurons to regulate different aspects of energy homeostasis and reproduction.

Abstract: Summary
Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation and interaction are increasingly associated with various cellular processes. However, little is known about the cellular signaling mechanisms that regulate proteins for distinct SUMO paralog conjugation and interactions. Using the transcriptional coregulator Daxx as a model, we show that SUMO paralog-selective binding and conjugation are regulated by phosphorylation of the Daxx SUMO-interacting motif (SIM). NMR structural studies show that Daxx 732E-I-I-V-L-S-D-S-D740 is a bona fide SIM that binds to SUMO-1 in a parallel orientation. Daxx-SIM is phosphorylated by CK2 kinase at residues S737 and S739. Phosphorylation promotes Daxx-SIM binding affinity toward SUMO-1 over SUMO-2/3, causing Daxx preference for SUMO-1 conjugation and interaction with SUMO-1-modified factors. Furthermore, Daxx-SIM phosphorylation enhances Daxx to sensitize stress-induced cell apoptosis via antiapoptotic gene repression. Our findings provide structural insights into the Daxx-SIM:SUMO-1 complex, a model of SIM phosphorylation-enhanced SUMO paralog-selective modification and interaction, and phosphorylation-regulated Daxx function in apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiovascular function depends on patent blood vessel formation by endothelial cells (ECs). However, the mechanisms underlying vascular “tubulogenesis” are only beginning to be unraveled. We show that endothelial tubulogenesis requires the Ras interacting protein 1, Rasip1, and its binding partner, the RhoGAP Arhgap29. Mice lacking Rasip1 fail to form patent lumens in all blood vessels, including the early endocardial tube. Rasipl null angioblasts fail to properly localize the polarity determinant Par3 and display defective cell polarity, resulting in mislocalized junctional complexes and loss of adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM). Similarly, depletion of either Rasip1 or Arhgap29 in cultured ECs blocks in vitro lumen formation, fundamentally alters the cytoskeleton, and reduces integrin-dependent adhesion to ECM. These defects result from increased RhoA/ROCK/myosin II activity and blockade of Cdc42 and Rac1 signaling. This study identifies Rasip1 as a unique, endothelial-specific regulator of Rho GTPase signaling, which is essential for blood vessel morphogenesis.

Abstract: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in two different media, viz. the commonly used M199 containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and endothelial cell growth factor and a defined media EGM-2 containing 2% FBS along with growth supplements in known concentrations. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different media on the growth potential and cell morphology in subsequent passages. We have established that a dual coating of gelatin and human fibronectin extracellular matrix provides optimal cell attachment. Growth rate for primary culture was almost double in defined media. For secondary culture a two fold higher proliferation rate was observed in defined EGM-2 media. Histological studies were done using phase contrast, confocal and scanning electron microscopy which showed that cells cultured in M199 started losing their morphological characteristic from 3rd passage and after 6th passage appeared to come in senescent stage, while in case of defined media there was no change observed in the cells up to 10th passage. A significant difference was found in the expression of soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) which is an endothelial cell marker on cells cultured in different media. Additionally it was observed that exposure duration to trypsin–EDTA during cell detachment also plays an important role in maintaining cell morphological characteristics. These results show that significant morphological changes appear in higher order passages if cells are grown in routine medium for a long time and therefore may not be suitable for cell signaling experiments.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic cells license far more origins than are actually used for DNA replication, thereby generating a large number of dormant origins. Accumulating evidence suggests that such origins play a role in chromosome stability and tumor suppression, though the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Here, we show that a loss of dormant origins results in an increased number of stalled replication forks, even in unchallenged S phase in primary mouse fibroblasts derived from embryos homozygous for the Mcm4Chaos3 allele. We found that this allele reduces the stability of the MCM2-7 complex, but confers normal helicase activity in vitro. Despite the activation of multiple fork recovery pathways, replication intermediates in these cells persist into M phase, increasing the number of abnormal anaphase cells with lagging chromosomes and/or acentric fragments. These findings suggest that dormant origins constitute a major pathway for stalled fork recovery, contributing to faithful chromosome segregation and tumor suppression.

ERK-MAPK Drives Lamellipodia Protrusion by Activating the WAVE2 Regulatory Complex,

Abstract: Summary
Cell movement begins with a leading edge protrusion, which is stabilized by nascent adhesions and retracted by mature adhesions. The ERK-MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase) localizes to protrusions and adhesions, but how it regulates motility is not understood. We demonstrate that ERK controls protrusion initiation and protrusion speed. Lamellipodial protrusions are generated via the WRC (WAVE2 regulatory complex), which activates the Arp2/3 actin nucleator for actin assembly. The WRC must be phosphorylated to be activated, but the sites and kinases that regulate its intermolecular changes and membrane recruitment are unknown. We show that ERK colocalizes with the WRC at lamellipodial leading edges and directly phosphorylates two WRC components: WAVE2 and Abi1. The phosphorylations are required for functional WRC interaction with Arp2/3 and actin during cell protrusion. Thus, ERK coordinates adhesion disassembly with WRC activation and actin polymerization to promote productive leading edge advancement during cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
During meiosis, chromosomes must find and align with their homologous partners. SUN and KASH-domain protein pairs play a conserved role by establishing transient linkages between chromosome ends and cytoskeletal forces across the intact nuclear envelope (NE). In C. elegans, a pairing center (PC) on each chromosome mediates homolog pairing and linkage to the microtubule network. We report that the polo kinases PLK-1 and PLK-2 are targeted to the PC by ZIM/HIM-8-pairing proteins. Loss of plk-2 inhibits chromosome pairing and licenses synapsis between nonhomologous chromosomes, indicating that PLK-2 is required for PC-mediated interhomolog interactions. plk-2 is also required for meiosis-specific phosphorylation of SUN-1 and establishment of dynamic SUN/KASH (SUN-1/ZYG-12) modules that promote homolog pairing. Our results provide key insights into the regulation of homolog pairing and reveal that targeting of polo-like kinases to the NE by meiotic chromosomes establishes the conserved linkages to cytoskeletal forces needed for homology assessment.

Abstract: Summary
In obese patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin delivery to and insulin-dependent glucose uptake by skeletal muscle are delayed and impaired. The mechanisms underlying the delay and impairment are unclear. We demonstrate that impaired insulin signaling in endothelial cells, due to reduced Irs2 expression and insulin-induced eNOS phosphorylation, causes attenuation of insulin-induced capillary recruitment and insulin delivery, which in turn reduces glucose uptake by skeletal muscle. Moreover, restoration of insulin-induced eNOS phosphorylation in endothelial cells completely reverses the reduction in capillary recruitment and insulin delivery in tissue-specific knockout mice lacking Irs2 in endothelial cells and fed a high-fat diet. As a result, glucose uptake by skeletal muscle is restored in these mice. Taken together, our results show that insulin signaling in endothelial cells plays a pivotal role in the regulation of glucose uptake by skeletal muscle. Furthermore, improving endothelial insulin signaling may serve as a therapeutic strategy for ameliorating skeletal muscle insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies to cell-surface antigens trigger activatory Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-mediated retrograde signals in leukocytes to control immune effector functions. Here, we uncover an FcγR mechanism that drives antibody-dependent forward signaling in target cells. Agonistic antibodies to death receptor 5 (DR5) induce cancer-cell apoptosis and are in clinical trials; however, their mechanism of action in vivo is not fully defined. Interaction of the DR5-agonistic antibody drozitumab with leukocyte FcγRs promoted DR5-mediated tumor-cell apoptosis. Whereas the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab required activatory FcγRs for tumoricidal function, drozitumab was effective in the context of either activatory or inhibitory FcγRs. A CD40-agonistic antibody required similar FcγR interactions to stimulate nuclear factor-κB activity in B cells. Thus, FcγRs can drive antibody-mediated receptor signaling in target cells.

Abstract: Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) are involved in the regulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. Drosophila Nup154 encodes a nucleoporin component of the NPC that is expressed in high proliferating tissues such as germ cells. Hypomorphic mutations in this gene cause male and female sterility and reduction of cell proliferation in the adult fly. Here, we present evidences of a decrease in the number of spermatogonial cells in Nup154 mutants, caused both by increased cell death and reduced cell proliferation. Furthermore, we also found that RNAi-mediated depletion of Nup154 in cultured cells prevented nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor Mothers against Dpp (Mad), suggesting a possible regulatory role for Nup154 in TGF-β signal transduction. These results were confirmed in vivo on mutant testes where we observed a similar defect in the nuclear accumulation of the co-Smad Medea.

Abstract: Astrocytes play critical roles in many aspects of brain functions via modulation of neurotransmission, metabolism, and structural remodeling in response to physiological or pathological stimuli. Activation of astrocytes is a common phenomenon in many brain pathologies such as stroke, trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we found that gene deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax (Bax-knockout) resulted in a spontaneous reactive astrogliosis in the dentate gyrus, as evidenced by the increased number/volume of astrocytes and cytoplasmic localization of the Olig2 protein. On the other hand, there was no evidence for microglial activation in the dentate gyrus of Bax-knockout mice. Previously, we reported that Bax-knockout mice failed to execute programmed cell death of adult-produced neurons, but the surplus neurons eventually impaired normal synaptic connections and dendritic arborization of dentate gyrus neurons. Therefore, we propose that the reactive astrocytes in the Baxknockout mice may play a role in tissue remodeling of the dentate gyrus following a failure in the programmed cell death of adult-produced neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp90 is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone. Previous structural analysis demonstrated that Hsp90 can adopt a large number of structurally distinct conformations; however, the functional role of this flexibility is not understood. Here we investigate the structural consequences of substrate binding with a model system in which Hsp90 interacts with a partially folded protein (Δ131Δ), a well-studied fragment of staphylococcal nuclease. SAXS measurements reveal that under apo conditions, Hsp90 partially closes around Δ131Δ, and in the presence of AMPPNP, Δ131Δ binds with increased affinity to Hsp90's fully closed state. FRET measurements show that Δ131Δ accelerates the nucleotide-driven open/closed transition and stimulates ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90. NMR measurements reveal that Hsp90 binds to a specific, highly structured region of Δ131Δ. These results suggest that Hsp90 preferentially binds a locally structured region in a globally unfolded protein, and this binding drives functional changes in the chaperone by lowering a rate-limiting conformational barrier.

Abstract: Summary
While mammals have a limited capacity to repair bone defects, zebrafish can completely regenerate amputated bony structures of their fins. Fin regeneration is dependent on formation of a blastema, a progenitor cell pool accumulating at the amputation plane. It is unclear which cells the blastema is derived from, whether it forms by dedifferentiation of mature cells, and whether blastema cells are multipotent. We show that mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate and form part of the blastema. Osteoblasts downregulate expression of intermediate and late bone differentiation markers and induce genes expressed by bone progenitors. Dedifferentiated osteoblasts proliferate in a FGF-dependent manner and migrate to form part of the blastema. Genetic fate mapping shows that osteoblasts only give rise to osteoblasts in the regenerate, indicating that dedifferentiation is not associated with the attainment of multipotency. Thus, bone can regenerate from mature osteoblasts via dedifferentiation, a finding with potential implications for human bone repair.

Abstract: Summary
PYR1/PYL/RCAR proteins (PYLs) are confirmed abscisic acid (ABA) receptors, which inhibit protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) upon binding to ABA. Arabidopsis thaliana has 14 PYLs, yet their functional distinction remains unclear. Here, we report systematic biochemical characterization of PYLs. A subclass of PYLs, represented by PYL10, inhibited PP2C in the absence of any ligand. Crystal structures of PYL10, both in the free form and in the HAB1 (PP2C)-bound state, revealed the structural basis for its constitutive activity. Structural-guided biochemical analyses revealed that ABA-independent inhibition of PP2C requires the PYLs to exist in a monomeric state. In addition, the residues guarding the entrance to the ligand-binding pocket of these PYLs should be bulky and hydrophobic. Based on these principles, we were able to generate monomeric PYL2 variants that gained constitutive inhibitory effect on PP2Cs. These findings provide an important framework for understanding the complex regulation of ABA signaling by PYL proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Studies in yeast demonstrate that signaling kinases have a surprisingly active role in the nucleus, where they tether to chromatin and modulate gene expression programs. Despite these seminal studies, the nuclear mechanism of how signaling kinases control transcription of mammalian genes is in its infancy. Here, we provide evidence for a hitherto unknown function of protein kinase C-theta (PKC-θ), which physically associates with the regulatory regions of inducible immune response genes in human T cells. Chromatin-anchored PKC-θ forms an active nuclear complex by interacting with RNA polymerase II, the histone kinase MSK-1, and the adaptor molecule 14-3-3ζ. ChIP-on-chip reveals that PKC-θ binds to promoters and transcribed regions of genes, as well as to microRNA promoters that are crucial for cytokine regulation. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the role of PKC-θ not only in normal T cell function, but also in circumstances of its ectopic expression in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle atrophy is a common and debilitating condition that lacks a pharmacologic therapy. To develop a potential therapy, we identified 63 mRNAs that were regulated by fasting in both human and mouse muscle, and 29 mRNAs that were regulated by both fasting and spinal cord injury in human muscle. We used these two unbiased mRNA expression signatures of muscle atrophy to query the Connectivity Map, which singled out ursolic acid as a compound whose signature was opposite to those of atrophy-inducing stresses. A natural compound enriched in apples, ursolic acid reduced muscle atrophy and stimulated muscle hypertrophy in mice. It did so by enhancing skeletal muscle insulin/IGF-I signaling and inhibiting atrophy-associated skeletal muscle mRNA expression. Importantly, ursolic acid's effects on muscle were accompanied by reductions in adiposity, fasting blood glucose, and plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. These findings identify a potential therapy for muscle atrophy and perhaps other metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
We have investigated the role of individual members of the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade in the onset of K-Ras oncogene-driven non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Ablation of Erk1 or Erk2 in K-Ras oncogene-expressing lung cells had no significant effect due to compensatory activities. Yet, elimination of both Erk kinases completely blocked tumor development. Similar results were obtained with Mek kinases. Ablation of B-Raf had no significant effect on tumor development. However, c-Raf expression was absolutely essential for the onset of NSCLC. Interestingly, concomitant elimination of c-Raf and B-Raf in adult mice had no deleterious consequences for normal homeostasis. These results indicate that c-Raf plays a unique role in mediating K-Ras signaling and makes it a suitable target for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a lipid growth factor that exerts diverse biological effects, including rapid neurite retraction and cell migration. Alterations in cell morphology, including neurite retraction, in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease involve hyperphosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein tau. Since LPA has been shown to induce neurite retraction in various cultured neural cells and the detailed underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been elucidated, we investigated whether LPA induced neurite retraction through tau-mediated signaling pathways in differentiated neuroblastoma cells. When Neuro2a cells differentiated with retinoic acid (RA) were exposed to LPA, cells exhibited neurite retraction in a time-dependent manner. The retraction of neurites was accompanied by the phosphorylation of tau. The LPA-induced neurite retraction and tau phosphorylation in differentiated Neuro2a cells were significantly abolished by the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) inhibitor lithium chloride. Interestingly, the LPA-stimulated tau phosphorylation and neurite retraction were markedly prevented by the administration of H89, an inhibitor of both cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) and cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Transfection of the dominant-negative CREBs, K-CREB and ACREB, failed to prevent LPA-induced tau phosphorylation and neurite retraction in differentiated Neuro2a cells. Taken together, these results suggest that GSK-3β and PKA, rather than CREB, play important roles in tau phosphorylation and neurite retraction in LPA-stimulated differentiated Neuro2a cells.

Abstract: Summary
Rapid recognition and signal transduction of mechanical wounding through various signaling molecules, including calcium (Ca2+), protein phosphorylation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), are necessary early events leading to stress resistance in plants. Here we report that an Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MPK8) connects protein phosphorylation, Ca2+, and ROS in the wound-signaling pathway. MPK8 is activated through mechanical wounding, and this activation requires direct binding of calmodulins (CaMs) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. MPK8 is also phosphorylated and activated by a MAPKK MKK3 in the prototypic kinase cascade, and full activation of MPK8 needs both CaMs and MKK3 in planta. The MPK8 pathway negatively regulates ROS accumulation through controlling expression of the Rboh D gene. These findings suggest that two major activation modes in eukaryotes, Ca2+/CaMs and the MAP kinase phosphorylation cascade, converge at MPK8 to monitor or maintain an essential part of ROS homeostasis.

Abstract: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-secreting neurons are key regulators of the reproductive behaviour in vertebrates. These neurons show a peculiar migratory pattern during embryonic development, and its perturbations have profound impact on fertility and other related functional aspects. Changes in the intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, induced by different extracellular signals, play a central role in the control of neuronal migration, but the available knowledge regarding GnRH neurons is still limited. Our goal was to investigate mechanisms that may be involved in the Ca2+ dependence of the migratory behaviour in these neurons. We focused on the “classical” Transient Receptor Potential (TRPC) subfamily of Ca2+-permeable cation channels, recently shown to be involved in other aspects of neuronal development. Using GN11 cells, immortalized early stage GnRH neurons, we set to investigate Ca2+ signals under basal conditions and in the presence of a well-established motogen, fetal calf serum (FCS), and the effect of pharmacological TRPC agonists and antagonists on Ca2+ oscillations, cell motility and proliferation. We have found that a subpopulation of GN11 cells shows spontaneous Ca2+ transients and that this activity is increased in the presence of serum. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that transcripts of some TRPC members are expressed in GN11 cells. Interestingly, pharmacological experiments with inhibitors, SKF-96365, lanthanum, anti-TRPC1 antibody, and activators, 1-oleil 2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, of TRPCs suggested that the activation of these channels can account for both the basal Ca2+ oscillations and the increased activity in the presence of FCS. Moreover, functional studies using the same pharmacological tools supported their involvement in the control of motility and proliferation. Thus, our data provide evidence for the involvement of Ca2+-permeable channels of the TRPC subfamily in the control of functional properties of neurosecretory cells and neuronal motility.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective death of motor neurons. Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) cause familial ALS but the molecular mechanisms whereby these mutations induce motor neuron death remain controversial. Here, we show that stable overexpression of mutant human SOD1 (G37R) – but not wild-type SOD1 (wt-SOD1) – in mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2a) results in morphological abnormalities of mitochondria accompanied by several dysfunctions. Activity of the oxidative phosphorylation complex I was significantly reduced in G37R cells and correlated with lower mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced levels of cytosolic ATP. Using targeted chimeric aequorin we further analyzed the consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction on cellular Ca2+ handling. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, elicited by IP3-induced Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was significantly reduced in G37R cells, while uptake induced by a brief Ca2+ pulse was not affected in permeabilized cells. The decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake resulted in increased cytosolic Ca2+ transients, whereas ER Ca2+ load and resting cytosolic Ca2+ levels were not affected. Together, these findings suggest that the mechanism linking mutant G37R SOD1 and ALS involves mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency resulting in ATP loss and impairment of mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis.

Abstract: Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a thiodisulfide oxidoreductase that catalyzes the formation, reduction and rearrangement of disulfide bonds in proteins of eukaryotes. The classical PDI has a signal peptide, two CXXC-containing thioredoxin catalytic sites (a,a’), two noncatalytic thioredoxin fold domains (b,b’), an acidic domain (c) and a C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal. Although PDI resides in the ER where it mediates the folding of nascent polypeptides of the secretory pathway, we recently showed that PDI5 of Arabidopsis thaliana chaperones and inhibits cysteine proteases during trafficking to vacuoles prior to programmed cell death of the endothelium in developing seeds. Here we describe Arabidopsis PDI2, which shares a primary structure similar to that of classical PDI. Recombinant PDI2 is imported into ER-derived microsomes and complements the E. coli protein-folding mutant, dsbA. PDI2 interacted with proteins in both the ER and nucleus, including ER-resident protein folding chaperone, BiP1, and nuclear embryo transcription factor, MEE8. The PDI2-MEE8 interaction was confirmed to occur in vitro and in vivo. Transient expression of PDI2-GFP fusions in mesophyll protoplasts resulted in labeling of the ER, nucleus and vacuole. PDI2 is expressed in multiple tissues, with relatively high expression in seeds and root tips. Immunoelectron microscopy with GFP- and PDI2-specific antisera on transgenic seeds (PDI2-GFP) and wild type roots demonstrated that PDI2 was found in the secretory pathway (ER, Golgi, vacuole, cell wall) and the nuclei. Our results indicate that PDI2 mediates protein folding in the ER and has new functional roles in the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton play a key role in numerous cellular processes. In Drosophila, fusion between a muscle founder cell and a fusion competent myoblast (FCM) is mediated by an invasive, F-actin-enriched podosome-like structure (PLS). Here, we show that the dynamics of the PLS is controlled by Blown fuse (Blow), a cytoplasmic protein required for myoblast fusion but whose molecular function has been elusive. We demonstrate that Blow is an FCM-specific protein that colocalizes with WASP, WIP/Solitary, and the actin focus within the PLS. Biochemically, Blow modulates the stability of the WASP-WIP complex by competing with WASP for WIP binding, leading to a rapid exchange of WASP, WIP and G-actin within the PLS, which, in turn, actively invades the adjacent founder cell to promote fusion pore formation. These studies identify a regulatory protein that modulates the actin cytoskeletal dynamics by controlling the stability of the WASP-WIP complex.

Abstract: Summary
Metazoans adapt to changing environmental conditions and to harmful challenges by attenuating growth and metabolic activities systemically. Recent studies in mice and flies indicate that endocrine signaling interactions between insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) and innate immune signaling pathways are critical for this adaptation, yet the temporal and spatial hierarchy of these signaling events remains elusive. Here, we identify and characterize a program of signaling interactions that regulates the systemic response of the Drosophila larva to localized DNA damage. We provide evidence that epidermal DNA damage induces an innate immune response that is kept in check by systemic repression of IIS activity. IIS repression induces NFκB/Relish signaling in the fat body, which is required for recovery of IIS activity in a second phase of the systemic response to DNA damage. This systemic response to localized DNA damage thus coordinates growth and metabolic activities across tissues, ensuring growth homeostasis and survival of the animal.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) employs membrane-bound ubiquitin ligases and the translocation-driving ATPase p97 to retrotranslocate misfolded proteins for proteasomal degradation. How retrotranslocated polypeptides bearing exposed hydrophobic motifs or transmembrane domains (TMDs) avoid aggregation before reaching the proteasome is unclear. Here we identify a ubiquitin ligase-associated multiprotein complex comprising Bag6, Ubl4A, and Trc35, which chaperones retrotranslocated polypeptides en route to the proteasome to improve ERAD efficiency. In vitro, Bag6, the central component of the complex, contains a chaperone-like activity capable of maintaining an aggregation-prone substrate in an unfolded yet soluble state. The physiological importance of this holdase activity is underscored by observations that ERAD substrates accumulate in detergent-insoluble aggregates in cells depleted of Bag6, or of Trc35, a cofactor that keeps Bag6 outside the nucleus for engagement in ERAD. Our results reveal a ubiquitin ligase-associated holdase that maintains polypeptide solubility to enhance protein quality control in mammalian cells.

Abstract: The therapeutic goal in treating cerebral ischemia is to reduce the extent of brain injury and thus minimize neurological impairment. We examined the effects of p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA), an active component of Gastrodia elata Blume, on transient focal cerebral ischemia-induced brain injury with respect to the involvement of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and neurotrophic factors. All animals were ovariectomized 14 days before ischemic injury. Ischemic injury was induced for 1 h by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24-h reperfusion. Three days before MCAO, the vehicle-treated and the HBA-treated groups received intramuscular sesame oil and HBA (25 mg/kg BW), respectively. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed decreased infarct volume in the ischemic lesion of HBA-treated animals. HBA pretreatment also promoted functional recovery, as measured by the modified neurological severity score (mNSS; p < 0.05). Moreover, expression of PDI, Nrf2, BDNF, GDNF, and MBP genes increased by HBA treatment. In vitro, H2O2-induced PC12 cell death was prevented by 24 h HBA treatment, but bacitracin, a PDI inhibitor, attenuated this cytoprotective effect in a dose-dependent manner. HBA treatment for 2 h also induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2, possibly activating the intracellular antioxidative system. These results suggest that HBA protects against brain damage by modulating cytoprotective genes, such as Nrf2 and PDI, and neurotrophic factors.

Abstract: Cellular senescence is characterized by cell-cycle arrest accompanied by various cell biological changes. Although these changes have been heavily relied on as senescence markers in numerous studies on senescence and its intervention, their underlying mechanisms and relationship to each other are poorly understood. Furthermore, the depth and the reversibility of those changes have not been addressed previously. Using flow cytometry coupled with confocal microscopy and Western blotting, we quantified various senescence-associated cellular changes and determined their time course profiles in MCF-7 cells undergoing DNA damage-induced senescence. The examined properties changed with several different kinetics patterns. Autofluorescence, side scattering, and the mitochondria content increased progressively and linearly. Cell volume, lysosome content, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level increased abruptly at an early stage. Meanwhile, senescence associated β-galactosidase activity increased after a lag of a few days. In addition, during the senescence progression, lysosomes exhibited a loss of integrity, which may have been associated with the accumulation of ROS. The finding that various senescence phenotypes matured at different rates with different lag times suggests multiple independent mechanisms controlling the expression of senescence phenotypes. This type of kinetics study would promote the understanding of how cells become fully senescent and facilitate the screening of methods that intervene in cellular senescence.

Abstract: Summary
Poly(ADP-ribose) is a major regulatory macromolecule in the nucleus, where it regulates transcription, chromosome structure, and DNA damage repair. Functions in the interphase cytoplasm are less understood. Here, we identify a requirement for poly(ADP-ribose) in the assembly of cytoplasmic stress granules, which accumulate RNA-binding proteins that regulate the translation and stability of mRNAs upon stress. We show that poly(ADP-ribose), six specific poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, and two poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase isoforms are stress granule components. A subset of stress granule proteins, including microRNA-binding Argonaute family members Ago1–4, are modified by poly(ADP-ribose), and such modification increases upon stress, a condition when both microRNA-mediated translational repression and microRNA-directed mRNA cleavage are relieved. Similar relief of repression is also observed upon overexpression of specific poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases or, conversely, upon knockdown of glycohydrolase. We conclude that poly(ADP-ribose) is a key regulator of posttranscriptional gene expression in the cytoplasm.

Abstract: In hepatocytes, as in other cell types, Ca2+ signaling is subject to complex regulations, which result largely from the intrinsic characteristics of the different inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) isoforms and from their interactions with other proteins. Although sigma1 receptors (Sig-1Rs) are widely expressed in the liver, their involvement in hepatic Ca2+ signaling remains unknown. We here report that in this cell type Sig-1R interact with type 1 isoforms of the InsP3 receptors (InsP3R-1). These results obtained by immunoprecipitation experiments are confirmed by the observation that Sig-1R proteins and InsP3R-1 colocalize in hepatocytes. However, Sig-1R ligands have no effect on InsP3-induced Ca2+ release in hepatocytes. This can be explained by the rather low expression level expression of InsP3R-1. In contrast, we find that Sig-1R ligands can inhibit agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling via an inhibitory effect on InsP3 synthesis. We show that this inhibition is due to the stimulation of PKC activity by Sig-1R, resulting in the well-known down-regulation of the signaling pathway responsible for the transduction of the extracellular stimulus into InsP3 synthesis. The PKC sensitive to Sig-1R activity belongs to the family of conventional PKC, but the precise molecular mechanism of this regulation remains to be elucidated.

Abstract: Summary
Expression of BRCA1 is commonly decreased in sporadic breast tumors, and this correlates with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. Here we show that BRCA1 transcripts are selectively enriched in the Argonaute/miR-182 complex and miR-182 downregulates BRCA1 expression. Antagonizing miR-182 enhances BRCA1 protein levels and protects them from IR-induced cell death, while overexpressing miR-182 reduces BRCA1 protein, impairs homologous recombination-mediated repair, and render cells hypersensitive to IR. The impaired DNA repair phenotype induced by miR-182 overexpression can be fully rescued by overexpressing miR-182-insensitive BRCA1. Consistent with a BRCA1-deficiency phenotype, miR-182-overexpressing breast tumor cells are hypersensitive to inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Conversely, antagonizing miR-182 enhances BRCA1 levels and induces resistance to PARP1 inhibitor. Finally, a clinical-grade PARP1 inhibitor impacts outgrowth of miR-182-expressing tumors in animal models. Together these results suggest that miR-182-mediated downregulation of BRCA1 impedes DNA repair and may impact breast cancer therapy.

Abstract: The guinea pig (Cavea porcellus) is a mammalian non-rodent species in the Caviidae family. The sensitivity of the respiratory system and the susceptibility to infectious diseases allows the guinea pig to be a useful model for both infectious and non-infectious lung diseases such as asthma and tuberculosis. In this report, we demonstrated for the first time, the major cell types and composition in the guinea pig airway epithelium, using cell type-specific markers by immunohistochemical staining using the commercial available immunological reagents that cross-react with guinea pig. Our results revealed the availability of antibodies cross-reacting with airway epithelial cell types of basal, non-ciliated columnar, ciliated, Clara, goblet and alveolar type II cells, as well as those cells expressing Mucin 5AC, Mucin 2, Aquaporin 4 and Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide. The distribution of these various cell types were quantified in the guinea pig airway by immunohistochemical staining and were comparable with morphometric studies using an electron microscopy assay. Moreover, this study also demonstrated that goblet cells are the main secretory cell type in the guinea pig's airway, distinguishing this species from rats and mice. These results provide useful information for the understanding of airway epithelial cell biology and mechanisms of epithelial–immune integration in guinea pig models.

Abstract: Mechanisms coordinating cell–cell interaction have appeared early in evolution. Allatotropin (AT), a neuropeptide isolated based on its ability to stimulate the synthesis of juvenile hormones (JHs) in insects has also been found in other invertebrate phyla. Despite this function, AT has proved to be myotropic. In the present study we analyze its expression in two groups of Turbellaria (Catenulida, Macrostomida), and its probable relationship with muscle tissue. The results show the presence of an AT-like peptide in the free living turbellaria analyzed. The analysis of the expression of the peptide together with phalloidin, suggests a functional relationship between the peptide and muscle tissue, showing that it could be acting as a myoregulator. The finding of immunoreactive fibers associated with sensory organs like ciliated pits in Catenulida and eyes in Macrostomida makes probable that AT could play a role in the physiological mechanisms controlling circadian activities. Furthermore, the existence of AT in several phyla of Protostomata suggests that this peptide could be a synapomorphic feature of this group. Indeed, the presence in organisms that do not undergo metamorphosis, could be signaling that it was first involved in myotropic activities, being the stimulation of the synthesis of JHs a secondary function acquired by the phylum Arthropoda.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is mobilized by the protein kinase ATM, which phosphorylates key players in the DNA damage response (DDR) network. A major question is how ATM controls DSB repair. Optimal repair requires chromatin relaxation at damaged sites. Chromatin reorganization is coupled to dynamic alterations in histone posttranslational modifications. Here, we show that in human cells, DSBs induce monoubiquitylation of histone H2B, a modification that is associated in undamaged cells with transcription elongation. We find that this process relies on recruitment to DSB sites and ATM-dependent phosphorylation of the responsible E3 ubiquitin ligase: the RNF20-RNF40 heterodimer. H2B monoubiquitylation is required for timely recruitment of players in the two major DSB repair pathways—nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination repair—and optimal repair via both pathways. Our data and previous data suggest a two-stage model for chromatin decondensation that facilitates DSB repair.

Abstract: Endosymbionts of the Cardinium-like genus are described in the testes and other tissues of the proturan Acerella muscorum (Ionescu). Few endosymbionts are present in the large apical cells of functional testes, but they become numerous at the end of the reproductive cycle. They are also found within sperm cells where induce their degeneration. The Gram-negative endosymbionts are characterized by the presence of microtubule-like structures (MLC) in their cytoplasm. It is suggested a possible role of the endosymbionts in the elimination of degenerating sperm cells when the testes activity is ended, thus somewhat playing a role in the timing of the reproductive cycle of the proturan species.

Abstract: Summary
The gastrointestinal tract is emerging as a key regulator of appetite and metabolism, but daunting neuroanatomical complexity has hampered identification of the relevant signals. Invertebrate models could provide a simple and genetically amenable alternative, but their autonomic nervous system and its visceral functions remain largely unexplored. Here we develop a quantitative method based on defecation behavior to uncover a central role for the Drosophila intestine in the regulation of nutrient intake, fluid, and ion balance. We then identify a key homeostatic role for autonomic neurons and hormones, including a brain-gut circuit of insulin-producing neurons modulating appetite, a vasopressin-like system essential for fluid homeostasis, and enteric neurons mediating sex peptide-induced changes in intestinal physiology. These conserved mechanisms of visceral control, analogous to those found in the enteric nervous system and hypothalamic/pituitary axis, enable the study of autonomic control in a model organism that has proved instrumental in understanding sensory and motor systems.

Abstract: The aim of the present study was to obtain a basic knowledge of the hematology in order to determine changes in blood parameters of the spotted rose snapper Lutjanus guttatus. The morphological features of blood cells were described according to the observations made by light microscopy of Wright–Giemsa-stained blood films. The reference intervals and the mean value were determined for each hematological parameter evaluated in healthy fish and data were compared to those of naturally infected, with dactylogyrid monogeneans fish. Infected fish showed a prevalence of 100% and a mean intensity of 246.6 parasites per fish. Mean values of HCT, WBC, thrombocytes percentage and eosinophils percentage were significantly higher (P<0.05) in the infected fish. In addition, lymphocytes percentage and total protein were significantly lower (P<0.05) in the infected fish compared to healthy fish. Only total WBC count, lymphocytes percentage and eosinophils percentage in infected fish were outside reference interval. The hematology of the spotted rose snapper of this study might serve as a basis for future studies and diagnosis. Changes observed in blood parameters in infected fish suggest that the immune system of L. guttatus was affected by the presence of the parasites.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) are ubiquitous on eukaryotic promoters. The formation of many NDRs cannot be readily explained by previously proposed mechanisms. Here, we carry out a focused study on a physiologically important NDR in the yeast CLN2 promoter (CLN2pr). We show that this NDR does not result from intrinsically unfavorable histone-DNA interaction. Instead, we identified eight conserved factor binding sites, including that of Reb1, Mcm1, and Rsc3, that cause the local nucleosome depletion. These nucleosome-depleting factors (NDFs) work redundantly, and simultaneously mutating all their binding sites eliminates CLN2pr NDR. The loss of the NDR induces unreliable “on/off” expression in individual cell cycles, but in the presence of the NDR, NDFs have little direct effect on transcription. We present bioinformatic evidence that the formation of many NDRs across the genome involves multiple NDFs. Our findings also provide significant insight into the composition and spatial organization of functional promoters.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanism by which protein folding is coupled to biosynthesis is a critical, but poorly understood, aspect of protein conformational diseases. Here we use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to characterize tertiary structural transitions of nascent polypeptides and show that the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of human CFTR, whose folding is defective in cystic fibrosis, folds via a cotranslational multistep pathway as it is synthesized on the ribosome. Folding begins abruptly as NBD1 residues 389–500 emerge from the ribosome exit tunnel, initiating compaction of a small, N-terminal α/β-subdomain. Real-time kinetics of synchronized nascent chains revealed that subdomain folding is rapid, occurs coincident with synthesis, and is facilitated by direct ATP binding to the nascent polypeptide. These findings localize the major CF defect late in the NBD1 folding pathway and establish a paradigm wherein a cellular ligand promotes vectorial domain folding by facilitating an energetically favored local peptide conformation.

Abstract: In glycerinated rabbit psoas muscle, Donnan potential measurements demonstrated that the net electric charge on the actin–myosin matrix undergoes a sharp switch-like transition at pCa50=6.8. The potentials are 2mV less negative at the lower pCa2+ (P<0.001). If ATP is present, the muscle contracts and breaks the microelectrode. Therefore the rigor state was studied. There is no reason to suppose a priori that a similar voltage switch does not occur during contraction, however. Calcium dependence is still apparent in muscles stretched beyond overlap (sarcomere length>3.8μm) and is also seen in the gap filaments between the A- and I-band ends; further stretching abolishes the dependence. These experiments strongly suggest that calcium dependence is controlled initially by the titin component, and that this control is lost when titin filaments break. We suppose that that effect is mediated by the titin kinase in the M-line region and may involve the extensible PEVK region of titin. There is great interest in the electric charge on proteins in muscle within the structural system. We suggest how changes in these charges may control the calcium activation process. We also suggest some simple experimental approaches that could clarify these effects.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial Ca2+ signals have been proposed to accelerate oxidative metabolism and ATP production to match Ca2+-activated energy-consuming processes. Efforts to understand the signaling role of mitochondrial Ca2+ have been hampered by the inability to manipulate matrix Ca2+ without directly altering cytosolic Ca2+. We were able to selectively buffer mitochondrial Ca2+ rises by targeting the Ca2+-binding protein S100G to the matrix. We find that matrix Ca2+ controls signal-dependent NAD(P)H formation, respiration, and ATP changes in intact cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that matrix Ca2+ increases are necessary for the amplification of sustained glucose-dependent insulin secretion in β cells. Through the regulation of NAD(P)H in adrenal glomerulosa cells, matrix Ca2+ also acts as a positive signal in reductive biosynthesis, which stimulates aldosterone secretion. Our dissection of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals reveals the physiological importance of matrix Ca2+ in energy metabolism required for signal-dependent hormone secretion.

Abstract: Calcium is important for muscle contraction and controls many cellular processes. Although there is evidence that calcium-mediated signals regulate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, the molecular mechanisms by which calcium regulates AMPK are poorly understood. To compare the function of sustained vs. intermittent calcium oscillations on AMPK activity and define specific signals in this pathway, we administered mice with aminoimidazole-carboxamide-ribonucleotide (AICAR) and caffeine with or without dantrolene. AMPK activity was increased by 10d AICAR treatment (P<0.01). Ten day caffeine treatment decreased AICAR-induced AMPK activity to control level. This repressed AMPK activity was blocked by dantrolene. Different calcium frequencies were simulated in C2C12 myotubes by alternating media containing caffeine and dantrolene. Intermittent calcium oscillation increased AMPK activity compared to control (P<0.05), whereas sustained calcium oscillation decreases AICAR-induced AMPK activity to control level. This result suggests a biphasic control of AMPK activity by calcium. Knockdown of CaMKII expression by short-hairpin RNA resulted in increased AMPK phosphorylation by AICAR even in the presence of caffeine. These data show different calcium oscillations elicit distinct responses in muscle cells suggesting that the negative effects of chronic calcium treatment on AMPK activity is partly mediated through the CaMKII signals.
