Abstract: FLT1 and its soluble form (sFLT1) arise as alternate transcripts from the same gene and sFLT1 can antagonize the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on its cognate receptors. We investigated the effect of VEGF and protein kinase C (PKC) activation on sFLT1 abundance. We demonstrated that VEGF stimulates sFLT1 and FLT1 mRNA and protein levels in vascular endothelial cells via VEGFR2 and PKC. Using an FLT1 expression vector with N and C-terminal epitope tags, we show that PKC activation increases the cleavage of FLT1 into an N-terminal extracellular fragment and a C-terminal intracellular fragment with the cleavage occurring adjacent to the transmembrane domain. The trafficking and glycosylation inhibitors brefeldin, monensin and tunicamycin substantially reduced cleavage and release of the N-terminal ectodomain of FLT1 and inhibited secretion of the isoforms of sFLT1. The shed FLT1 ectodomain can bind VEGF and PlGF and inhibit VEGF-induced vascular tube formation thus confirming that it is functionally equivalent to the alternately spliced and secreted sFLT1 isoforms.

Abstract: O-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic and reversible posttranslational modification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. In recent years, the roles of O-GlcNAcylation in several human malignant tumors have been investigated, and O-GlcNAcylation was found to be linked to cellular features relevant to metastasis. In this study, we modeled four diverse ovarian cancer cells and investigated the effects of O-GlcNAcylation on ovarian cancer cell migration. We found that total O-GlcNAcylation level was elevated in HO-8910PM cells compared to OVCAR3 cells. Additionally, through altering the total O-GlcNAcylation level by OGT silencing or OGA inhibition, we found that the migration of OVCAR3 cells was dramatically enhanced by PUGNAc and Thiamet G treatment, and the migration ability of HO-8910PM cells was significantly inhibited by OGT silencing. Furthermore, we also found that the expression of E-cadherin, an O-GlcNAcylated protein in ovarian cancer cells, was reduced by OGA inhibition in OVCAR3 cells and elevated by OGT silencing in HO-8910PM cells. These results indicate that O-GlcNAcylation could enhance ovarian cancer cell migration and decrease the expression of E-cadherin. Our studies also suggest that O-GlcNAcylation might become another potential target for the therapy of ovarian cancer.

Abstract: The ChlR1 DNA helicase is mutated in Warsaw breakage syndrome characterized by developmental anomalies, chromosomal breakage, and sister chromatid cohesion defects. However, the mechanism by which ChlR1 preserves genomic integrity is largely unknown. Here, we describe the roles of ChlR1 in DNA replication recovery. We show that ChlR1 depletion renders human cells highly sensitive to cisplatin; an interstrand-crosslinking agent that causes stalled replication forks. ChlR1 depletion also causes accumulation of DNA damage in response to cisplatin, leading to a significant delay in resolution of DNA damage. We also report that ChlR1-depleted cells display defects in the repair of double-strand breaks induced by the I-PpoI endonuclease and bleomycin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ChlR1-depeleted cells show significant delays in replication recovery after cisplatin treatment. Taken together, our results indicate that ChlR1 plays an important role in efficient DNA repair during DNA replication, which may facilitate efficient establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.

Abstract: Cytokine biology began in the 1950s, and by 1988, a large number of cytokines, with a myriad of biological actions, had been discovered. In 1988, the basis of the protein chaperoning function of the heat shock, or cell stress, proteins was identified, and it was assumed that this was their major activity. However, since this time, evidence has accumulated to show that cell stress proteins are secreted by cells and can stimulate cellular cytokine synthesis with the generation of pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokine networks. Cell stress can also control cytokine synthesis, and cytokines are able to induce, or even inhibit, the synthesis of selected cell stress proteins and may also promote their release. How cell stress proteins control the formation of cytokines is not understood and how cytokines control cell stress protein synthesis depends on the cellular compartment experiencing stress, with cytoplasmic heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) having a variety of actions on cytokine gene transcription. The endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response also exhibits a complex set of behaviours in terms of control of cytokine synthesis. In addition, individual intracellular cell stress proteins, such as Hsp27 and Hsp90, have major roles in controlling cellular responses to cytokines and in controlling cytokine synthesis in response to exogenous factors. While still confusing, the literature supports the hypothesis that cell stress proteins and cytokines may generate complex intra- and extra-cellular networks, which function in the control of cells to external and internal stressors and suggests the cell stress response as a key parameter in cytokine network generation and, as a consequence, in control of immunity.

Abstract: The salamander is the only tetrapod that regenerates complex body structures throughout life. Deciphering the underlying molecular processes of regeneration is fundamental for regenerative medicine and developmental biology, but the model organism had limited tools for molecular analysis. We describe a comprehensive set of germline transgenic strains in the laboratory-bred salamander Ambystoma mexicanum (axolotl) that open up the cellular and molecular genetic dissection of regeneration. We demonstrate tissue-dependent control of gene expression in nerve, Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, muscle, epidermis, and cartilage. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of tamoxifen-induced Cre/loxP-mediated recombination to indelibly mark different cell types. Finally, we inducibly overexpress the cell-cycle inhibitor p16INK4a, which negatively regulates spinal cord regeneration. These tissue-specific germline axolotl lines and tightly inducible Cre drivers and LoxP reporter lines render this classical regeneration model molecularly accessible.

Abstract: Cartilaginous matrix-degenerative diseases like osteoarthritis (OA) are characterized by gradual cartilage erosion, and also by increased presence of cells with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) character within the affected tissues. Moreover, primary chondrocytes long since are known to de-differentiate in vitro and to be chondrogenically re-differentiable. Since both findings appear to conflict with each other, we quantitatively assessed the mesenchymal differentiation potential of OA patient cartilage-derived cells (CDC) towards the osteogenic and adipogenic lineage in vitro and compared it to that of MSC isolated from adipose tissue (adMSC) of healthy donors. We analyzed expression of MSC markers CD29, CD44, CD105, and CD166, and, following osteogenic and adipogenic induction in vitro, quantified their expression of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation markers. Furthermore, CDC phenotype and proliferation were monitored. We found that CDC exhibit an MSC CD marker expression pattern similar to adMSC and a similar increase in proliferation rate during osteogenic differentiation. In contrast, the marked reduction of proliferation observed during adipogenic differentiation of adMSC was absent in CDC. Quantification of differentiation markers revealed a strong osteogenic differentiation potential for CDC, however almost no capacity for adipogenic differentiation. Since in the pathogenesis of OA, cartilage degeneration coincides with high bone turnover rates, the high osteogenic differentiation potential of OA patient-derived CDC may affect clinical therapeutic regimens aiming at autologous cartilage regeneration in these patients.

Abstract: Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from several tumors and are implicated to play critical roles to increase malignant cell growth, invasion and metastasis. Here, we show that the MSC-like cells were isolated from human colon cancer tissues. These isolated hCC-MSCs (human colon cancer-derived mesenchymal stem cells) shared similar characteristic features with bone marrow-derived MSCs, which include cell morphology, surface antigens and specific gene expression. Additionally, the hCC-MSCs could differentiate into osteocytes or adipocytes under appropriate culture conditions. The conditioned medium collected from the cultured hCC-MSCs was shown to enhance the migration and invasive activity of HCT-116 colon cancer cells in vitro. Besides, transplantation of HCT-116 cells along with hCC-MSCs in nude mice increased the tumor growth and metastasis. Further study revealed that IL-6 present in the hCC-MSC-conditioned medium sufficiently induced the levels of Notch-1 and CD44 in HCT-116 and HT-29 cells, which contribute to enhance tumorigenic activity of HCT-116 and HT-29 cells. By using immunohistochemical staining, the intense co-expression of IL-6, Notch-1 and CD44 was predominantly detected in human colon cancer tissues. Taken together, our findings suggest the importance of the IL-6/Notch-1/CD44 signaling axis in the interaction between hCC-MSCs and colon cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Host inflammation alters the availability of nutrients such as iron to limit microbial growth. However, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium thrives in the inflamed gut by scavenging for iron with siderophores. By administering Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, which assimilates iron by similar mechanisms, we show that this nonpathogenic bacterium can outcompete and reduce S. Typhimurium colonization in mouse models of acute colitis and chronic persistent infection. This probiotic activity depends on E. coli Nissle iron acquisition, given that mutants deficient in iron uptake colonize the intestine but do not reduce S. Typhimurium colonization. Additionally, the ability of E. coli Nissle to overcome iron restriction by the host protein lipocalin 2, which counteracts some siderophores, is essential, given that S. Typhimurium is unaffected by E. coli Nissle in lipocalin 2-deficient mice. Thus, iron availability impacts S. Typhimurium growth, and E. coli Nissle reduces S. Typhimurium intestinal colonization by competing for this limiting nutrient.

Abstract: Barth syndrome (BTHS) patients carrying mutations in tafazzin (TAZ1), which is involved in the final maturation of cardiolipin, present with dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, growth retardation and neutropenia. To study how mitochondrial function is impaired in BTHS patients, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to develop a novel and relevant human model system for BTHS. BTHS–iPSCs generated from dermal fibroblasts of three patients with different mutations in TAZ1 expressed pluripotency markers, and were able to differentiate into cells derived from all three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo. We used these cells to study the impact of tafazzin deficiency on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We found an impaired remodeling of cardiolipin, a dramatic decrease in basal oxygen consumption rate and in the maximal respiratory capacity in BTHS–iPSCs. Simultaneous measurement of extra-cellular acidification rate allowed us a thorough assessment of the metabolic deficiency in BTHS patients. Blue native gel analyses revealed that decreased respiration coincided with dramatic structural changes in respiratory chain supercomplexes leading to a massive increase in generation of reactive oxygen species. Our data demonstrate that BTHS–iPSCs are capable of modeling BTHS by recapitulating the disease phenotype and thus are important tools for studying the disease mechanism.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are emerging as an attractive alternative source for cell replacement therapy since the cells can be expanded in culture indefinitely and differentiated into any cell types in the body. In order to optimize cell-to-cell interaction, cell proliferation and differentiation into specific lineages as well as tissue organization, it is important to provide a microenvironment for the hESCs which mimics the stem cell niche. One approach is to provide a three-dimensional (3D) environment such as encapsulation. We present an approach to culture and differentiate hESCs into midbrain dopamine (mdDA) neurons in a 3D microenvironment using alginate microcapsules for the first time. A detailed gene and protein expression analysis during neuronal differentiation showed an increased gene and protein expression of various specific DA neuronal markers, particularly tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) by >100 folds after 2weeks and at least 50% higher expression after 4weeks respectively, compared to cells differentiated under conventional two-dimensional (2D) platform. The encapsulated TH+ cells co-expressed mdDA neuronal markers, forkhead box protein A-2 (FOXA2) and pituitary homeobox-3 (PITX3) after 4weeks and secreted approximately 60pg/ml/106 cells higher DA level when induced. We propose that the 3D platform facilitated an early onset of DA neuronal generation compared to that with conventional 2D system which also secretes more DA under potassium-induction. It is a very useful model to study the proliferation and directed differentiation of hESCs to various lineages, particularly to mdDA neurons. This 3D system also allows the separation of feeder cells from hESCs during the process of differentiation and also has potential for immune-isolation during transplantation studies.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry is dependent on coreceptor complex formation between the tetraspanin superfamily member CD81 and the tight junction protein claudin-1 (CLDN1) on the host cell membrane. The receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR acts as a cofactor for HCV entry by promoting CD81-CLDN1 complex formation via unknown mechanisms. We identify the GTPase HRas, activated downstream of EGFR signaling, as a key host signal transducer for EGFR-mediated HCV entry. Proteomic analysis revealed that HRas associates with tetraspanin CD81, CLDN1, and the previously unrecognized HCV entry cofactors integrin β1 and Ras-related protein Rap2B in hepatocyte membranes. HRas signaling is required for lateral membrane diffusion of CD81, which enables tetraspanin receptor complex assembly. HRas was also found to be relevant for entry of other viruses, including influenza. Our data demonstrate that viruses exploit HRas signaling for cellular entry by compartmentalization of entry factors and receptor trafficking.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor engagement by HIV-1 during host cell entry activates signaling pathways that can reprogram the cell for optimal viral replication. To obtain a global view of the signaling events induced during HIV-1 entry, we conducted a quantitative phosphoproteomics screen of primary human CD4+ T cells after infection with an HIV-1 strain that engages the receptors CD4 and CXCR4. We quantified 1,757 phosphorylation sites with high stringency. The abundance of 239 phosphorylation sites from 175 genes, including several proteins in pathways known to be impacted by HIV-receptor binding, changed significantly within a minute after HIV-1 exposure. Several previously uncharacterized HIV-1 host factors were also identified and confirmed through RNAi depletion studies. Surprisingly, five serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins involved in messenger RNA splicing, including the splicing factor SRm300 (SRRM2), were differentially phosophorylated. Mechanistic studies with SRRM2 suggest that HIV-1 modulates host cell alternative splicing machinery during entry in order to facilitate virus replication and release.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding BRCA1 mutant cancers is hampered by difficulties in obtaining primary cells from patients. We therefore generated and characterized 24 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from fibroblasts of eight individuals from a BRCA1 5382insC mutant family. All BRCA1 5382insC heterozygous fibroblasts, iPSCs, and teratomas maintained equivalent expression of both wild-type and mutant BRCA1 transcripts. Although no difference in differentiation capacity was observed between BRCA1 wild-type and mutant iPSCs, there was elevated protein kinase C-theta (PKC-theta) in BRCA1 mutant iPSCs. Cancer cell lines with BRCA1 mutations and hormone-receptor-negative breast cancers also displayed elevated PKC-theta. Genome sequencing of the 24 iPSC lines showed a similar frequency of reprogramming-associated de novo mutations in BRCA1 mutant and wild-type iPSCs. These data indicate that iPSC lines can be derived from BRCA1 mutant fibroblasts to study the effects of the mutation on gene expression and genome stability.

Abstract: Summary
The obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) has been associated with cervical and ovarian cancer development. However, establishment of causality and the underlying mechanisms remain outstanding. Our analysis of Ctr-induced alterations to global host histone modifications revealed distinct patterns of histone marks during acute and persistent infections. In particular, pH2AX (Ser139) and H3K9me3, hallmarks of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), respectively, showed sustained upregulation during Ctr infection. Ctr-induced reactive oxygen species were found to contribute to persistent DSBs, which in turn elicited SAHF formation in an ERK-dependent manner. Furthermore, Ctr interfered with DNA damage responses (DDR) by inhibiting recruitment of the DDR proteins pATM and 53BP1 to damaged sites. Despite impaired DDR, Ctr-infected cells continued to proliferate, supported by enhanced oncogenic signals involving ERK, CyclinE, and SAHF. Thus, by perturbing host chromatin, DSB repair, and cell-cycle regulation, Ctr generates an environment favorable for malignant transformation.

Abstract: Mechanisms involved in establishing the organization and numbers of fibres in a muscle are not completely understood. During Drosophila indirect flight muscle (IFM) formation, muscle growth is achieved by both incorporating hundreds of nuclei, and hypertrophy. As a result, IFMs provide a good model with which to understand the mechanisms that govern overall muscle organization and growth. We present a detailed analysis of the organization of dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs), a subset of the IFMs. We show that each DLM is similar to a vertebrate fascicle and consists of multiple muscle fibres. However, increased fascicle size does not necessarily change the number of constituent fibres, but does increase the number of myofibrils packed within the fibres. We also find that altering the number of myoblasts available for fusion changes DLM fascicle size and fibres are loosely packed with myofibrils. Additionally, we show that knock down of genes required for mitochondrial fusion causes a severe reduction in the size of DLM fascicles and fibres. Our results establish the organization levels of DLMs and highlight the importance of the appropriate number of nuclei and mitochondrial fusion in determining the overall organization, growth and size of DLMs.

Abstract: The transcription factors c-Myc and Mnt regulate gene expression through dimerization with Max and binding to E-boxes in target genes. While c-Myc activates gene expression via recruitment of histone modifying complexes, Mnt acts as a transcriptional repressor. Here, we used the Xenopus leavis oocyte system to address the effect of c-Myc and Mnt on transcription and chromatin remodeling over the E-box region in the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter. As expected we found elevated and decreased levels of hTERT transcription upon exogenously expressed c-Myc/Max and Mnt/Max, respectively. In addition, we confirmed binding of these heterodimers to both E-boxes already enriched with H3K9ac and H4K16ac. These chromatin marks were further enhanced upon c-Myc/Max binding followed by increased DNA accessibility in the E-box region. In contrast, Mnt/Max inhibited Myc-induced transcription and mediated repression through complete chromatin condensation and deacetylation of H3K9 and H4K16 across the E-box region. Importantly, Mnt was able to counteract c-Myc mediated activation even when expressed at low levels, suggesting Mnt to act as a strong repressor by closing the chromatin structure. Collectively our data demonstrate that the balance between c-Myc and Mnt activity determines the transcriptional outcome of the hTERT promoter by modulation of the chromatin architecture.

In the present study, in order to investigate the intercellular communication between human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) and breast cancer cells (BCCs, MDA-MB-231), we recruited cell-internalizing quantum dots (i-QD) generated by conjugation of cell-internalizing anti-mortalin antibody and quantum dots (QD). Co-culture of illuminated and color-coded hMSCs (QD655) and BCCs (QD585) revealed the intercellular transfer of QD655 signal from hMSCs to BCCs. The amount of QD double positive BCCs increased gradually within 48h of co-culture. We found prominent intercellular transfer of QD655 in hanging drop co-culture system and it was non-existent when hMSCs and BBCs cells were co-cultured in trans-well system lacking imminent cell–cell contact. Fluorescent and electron microscope analyses also supported that the direct cell-to-cell interactions may be required for the intercellular transfer of QD655 from hMSCs to BCCs. To the best of our knowledge, the study provides a first demonstration of transcellular crosstalk between stromal cells and BCCs that involve direct contact and may also include a transfer of mortalin, an anti-apoptotic and growth-promoting factor enriched in cancer cells.

Abstract: Acute cold restraint stress (ACRS) has been reported to suppress host defenses against Listeria monocytogenes, and this suppression was mediated by beta1-adrenoceptors (β1-ARs). Although ACRS appears to inhibit mainly early innate immune defenses, interference with leukocyte chemotaxis and the involvement of β1-AR (or β2-AR) signaling had not been assessed. Thus, the link between sympathetic nerve stimulation, release of neurotransmitters, and changes in blood leukocyte profiles, including oxidative changes, following ACRS was evaluated. The numbers of leukocyte subsets in the blood were differentially affected by β1-ARs and β2-ARs following ACRS; CD3+ (CD4 and CD8) T-cells were shown to be decreased following ACRS, and the T cell lymphopenia was mediated mainly through a β2-AR mechanism, while the decrease in CD19+ B-cells was influenced through both β1- and β2-ARs, as assessed by pharmacological and genetic manipulations. In contrast to the ACRS-induced loss of circulating lymphocytes, the number of circulating neutrophils was increased (i.e., neutrophilia), and this neutrophilia was mediated through β1-ARs. The increase in circulating neutrophils was not due to an increase in serum chemokines promoting neutrophil emigration from the bone marrow; rather it was due to neutrophil release from the bone marrow through activation of a β1-AR pathway. There was no loss of glutathione in any of the leukocyte subsets suggesting that there was minimal oxidative stress; however, there was early production of nitric oxide and generation of some protein radicals. Premature egress of neutrophils from bone marrow is suggested to be due to norepinephrine induction of nitric oxide, which affects the early release of neutrophils from bone marrow and lessens host defenses.

Abstract: Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage by activating damage checkpoint pathways, which arrest cell cycle progression and induce gene expression. We isolated a full-length cDNA encoding a 49-kDa protein from Leishmania major, which exhibited significant deduced amino acid sequence homology with the annotated Leishmania sp. DNA damage-inducible (Ddi1-like) protein, as well as with the Ddi1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to the previously described Ddi1 protein, the protein from L. major displays three domains: (1) an NH2-terminal ubiquitin like; (2) a COOH terminal ubiquitin-associated; (3) a retroviral aspartyl proteinase, containing the typical D[S/T]G signature. The function of the L. major Ddi1-like recombinant protein was investigated after expression in baculovirus/insect cells and biochemical analysis, revealing preferential substrate selectivity for aspartyl proteinase A2 family substrates, with optimal activity in acidic conditions. The proteolytic activity was inhibited by aspartyl proteinase inhibitors. Molecular modeling of the retroviral domain of the Ddi1-like Leishmania protein revealed a dimer structure that contained a double Asp-Ser-Gly-Ala amino acid sequence motif, in an almost identical geometry to the exhibited by the homologous retroviral aspartyl protease domain of yeast Ddi1 protein. Our results indicate that the isolated Ddi1-like protein is a functional aspartyl proteinase in L. major, opening possibility to be considered as a potential target for novel antiparasitic drugs.

Abstract: In this study we characterized 3H-2-deoxy-d-glucose (3H -DG) uptake by the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF7 and the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines and investigated the effect of quercetin (QUE) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) upon 3H-DG uptake, glucose metabolism and cell viability and proliferation. In both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells 3H-DG uptake was (a) time-dependent, (b) saturable with similar capacity (Vmax) and affinity (Km), (c) potently inhibited by cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of the facilitative glucose transporters (GLUT), (d) sodium-independent and (e) slightly insulin-stimulated. This suggests that 3H-DG uptake by both cell types is mediated by members of the GLUT family, including the insulin-responsive GLUT4 or GLUT12, while being independent of the sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1). QUE and EGCG markedly and concentration-dependently inhibited 3H-DG uptake by MCF7 and by MDA-MB-231 cells, and both compounds blocked lactate production by MCF7 cells. Additionally, a 4h-treatment with QUE or EGCG decreased MCF7 cell viability and proliferation, an effect that was more potent when glucose was available in the extracellular medium. Our results implicate QUE and EGCG as metabolic antagonists in breast cancer cells, independently of estrogen signalling, and suggest that these flavonoids could serve as therapeutic agents/adjuvants even for ER-negative breast tumors.

Abstract: We present a multi-technique study on in vitro epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human MCF-7 cells cultured on electrospun scaffolds of poly(l-lactic acid) (PLA), with random and aligned fiber orientations. Our aim is to investigate the morphological and genetic characteristics induced by extracellular matrix in tumor cells cultured in different 3D environments, and at different time points. Cell vitality was assessed with AlamarBlue at days 1, 3, 5 and 7. Scanning electron microscopy was performed at culture days 3 and 7. Immunohistochemistry (for E-cadherin, β-catenin, cytokeratins, nucleophosmin, tubulin, Ki-67 and vimentin), immunofluorescence (for F-actin) western blot (for E-cadherin, β-catenin and vimentin) and transmission electron microscopy were carried out at day 7. An EMT gene array followed by PCR analysis confirmed the regulation of selected genes. At day 7, scanning electron microscopy on aligned-PLA revealed spindle-shaped cells gathered in buds and ribbon-like structures, with a higher nucleolar/nuclear ratio and a loss in E-cadherin and β-catenin at immunohistochemistry and western blot. An up-regulation of SMAD2, TGF-β2, TFPI2 and SOX10 was found in aligned-PLA compared to random-PLA cultured cells. The topography of the extracellular matrix has a role in tumor EMT, and a more aggressive phenotype characterizes MCF-7 cells cultured on aligned-PLA scaffold.

Abstract: Non-physiological components of peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDF) lead to the injury of peritoneal mesothelial cells resulting in the failure of peritoneal dialysis (PD) potentially via inadequate induction of the protective heat shock response (HSR). Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is a negative regulator of cell survival partly by suppression of the HSR and is influenced by stress stimuli also present in conventional PDF. The effects of PDF on GSK-3β activation and the impact of GSK-3β inhibition with lithium (LiCl) were investigated on cell survival with special regard to HSR, in particular to heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF-1) activation and Hsp72 production in an in vitro model of PD using MeT-5A and primary mesothelial cells. Incubation of cells with the PDF Dianeal® (glucose-based, low pH, high glucose degradation products (GDP)) and Extraneal® (icodextrin-based, low pH, low GDP) caused activation of GSK-3β compared to the other tested PDF, i.e. Balance®, Physioneal® (normal pH, glucose-based, low GDP) and Nutrineal® (moderately acidic, amino acid-based). Inhibition of GSK-3β with LiCl in Dianeal® and Extraneal®-treated cells dose-dependently decreased cell damage and death rate and was paralleled by higher HSF-1 activation and Hsp72 expression. GSK-3β is activated by low pH GDP containing PDF with and without glucose as osmotic agent, indicating that GSK-3β is involved in mesothelial cell signalling in response to experimental PD. Inhibition of GSK-3β with LiCl ameliorated cell injury and improved HSR upon PDF exposure. Thus, GSK-3β inhibitors likely have therapeutic potential as cytoprotective additive for decreasing PDF toxicity.

Abstract: Endothelial cells (ECs) are an essential component of the hematopoietic microenvironment, which maintains and regulates hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although ECs can support the regeneration of otherwise lethally-irradiated HSCs, the mechanisms are not well understood. To further understand this phenomenon, we studied HSC regeneration from irradiated bone marrow using co-culture with human aortic ECs (HAECs). Co-culture with HAECs induced a 24-fold expansion of long-term HSCs (CD150+, lineagelo, Sca-1+, c-Kit+; CD150+LSK cells) in vitro. These cells gave rise to functional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with colony-forming activity, multilineage reconstitution and serial transplantation potential. Furthermore, HAECs significantly reduced DNA damage in irradiated LSK cells within 24h. Remarkably, we were able to delay the exposure of irradiated bone marrow to the regenerative, HAEC-derived signals for up to 48h and still rescue functional HSCs. G-CSF is the gold standard for promoting hematopoietic regeneration in vivo. However, when compared to HAECs, in vitro G-CSF treatment promoted lineage differentiation and regenerated 5-fold fewer CD150+LSK cells. Together, our results show that HAECs are powerful, direct mitigators of HSC injury and DNA damage. Identification of the HAEC-derived factors that rescue HSCs may lead to improved therapies for hematopoietic regeneration after radiation injury.

Abstract: Summary
Shifts in commensal microbiota composition are emerging as a hallmark of gastrointestinal inflammation. In particular, outgrowth of γ-proteobacteria has been linked to the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease and the pathologic consequences of infections. Here we show that following acute Toxoplasma gondii gastrointestinal infection of mice, control of commensal outgrowth is a highly coordinated process involving both the host response and microbial signals. Notably, neutrophil emigration to the intestinal lumen results in the generation of organized intraluminal structures that encapsulate commensals and limit their contact with the epithelium. Formation of these luminal casts depends on the high-affinity N-formyl peptide receptor, Fpr1. Consequently, after infection, mice deficient in Fpr1 display increased microbial translocation, poor commensal containment, and increased mortality. Altogether, our study describes a mechanism by which the host rapidly contains commensal pathobiont outgrowth during infection. Further, these results reveal Fpr1 as a major mediator of host commensal interaction during dysbiosis.

Abstract: Summary
The interferon-inducible myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins play important roles in combating a wide range of virus infections. MxA inhibits many RNA and DNA viruses, whereas the antiviral activity of MxB is less well established. We find that human MxB inhibits HIV-1 infection by reducing the level of integrated viral DNA. Passaging HIV-1 through MxB-expressing cells allowed the evolution of a mutant virus that escapes MxB restriction. HIV-1 escapes MxB restriction by mutating the alanine residue at position 88 in the viral capsid protein (CA), with a consequent loss of CA interaction with the host peptidylprolyl isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA), suggesting a role for CypA in MxB restriction. Consistent with this, MxB associates with CypA, and shRNA-mediated CypA depletion or cyclosporine A treatment resulted in the loss of MxB inhibition of HIV-1. Taken together, we conclude that human MxB protein inhibits HIV-1 DNA integration by a CypA-dependent mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Immunization with vaccinia virus (VACV), the virus comprising the smallpox vaccine, induces memory CD8+ T cells that protect from subsequent infections with smallpox in humans or the related ectromelia virus (ECTV) in mice. Memory CD8+ T cells largely mediate these effects by expanding into secondary effectors that secrete the antiviral cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and induce cytolysis via releasing factors such as perforin, which permeabilizes target cells. We show that protection from ECTV infection after VACV immunization depends on the initial memory cell frequency and ability of expanded secondary effectors to kill infected targets in a perforin-dependent manner. Although IFN-γ is essential for antiviral protection, it can be produced by either secondary effectors or concomitant primary effector CD8+ T cells recruited to the response. Thus, during lethal virus challenge, memory CD8+ T cells are required for cytolytic killing of infected cells, but primary effectors can play important roles by producing IFN-γ.

Abstract: It has been suggested that nitric oxide (NO) derived from chronically inflamed tissues is a cause of carcinogenesis. We herein demonstrated that administration of an inducible NO synthase inhibitor, aminoguanidine, significantly suppressed the tumorigenic conversion of human colonic adenoma (FPCK-1-1) cells into adenocarcinoma (FPCK/Inflam) cells accelerated by foreign body-induced chronic inflammation in nude mice. To determine whether NO directly promotes carcinogenesis, we exposed FPCK-1-1 cells continuously to chemically generated NO (FPCK/NO), and periodically examined their tumorigenicity. FPCK/NO cells formed tumors, whereas vehicle-treated cells (FPCK/NaOH) did not. We selected a tumorigenic population from FPCK/NO cells kept it in three-dimensional (3D) culture where in vivo-like multicellular spheroidal growth was expected. FPCK/Inflam cells developed large spheroids whereas FPCK/NO cells formed tiny but growing compact aggregates in 3D culture. Meanwhile, FPCK-1-1 and FPCK/NaOH cells underwent anoikis (apoptotic cell death consequential on insufficient cell-to-substrate interactions) through activation of caspase 3. The survived cells in the 3D culture (FPCK/NO/3D), which were derived from FPCK/NO cells, showed a similar tumor incidence to that of FPCK/Inflam cells. These results showed that NO was one of the causative factors for the acceleration of colon carcinogenesis, especially in the conversion from adenoma to adenocarcinoma in the chronic inflammatory environment.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (hsps) have been studied in numerous cancer types, but a clear view of their clinical relevance in melanoma remains elusive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression of hsps in melanoma with respect to patient clinical parameters. Using Western immunoblotting, hsps 90, 70, 60, 40 and 32 were observed to be widely expressed in metastatic melanomas (n = 31), while immunofluorescence demonstrated that in the majority of samples these hsps, apart from hsp32, were increased in expression in melanoma cells compared with surrounding non-melanoma cells in situ (n = 8). Correlating hsp expression with patient clinical parameters indicated that greater hsp90 (P < 0.02) and hsp40 (P < 0.03) expression correlated with advanced stage (stage III Vs stage IV), while in the case of hsp40, this was additionally associated with reduced patient survival (P < 0.05). In contrast, higher hsp32 expression was associated with improved patient survival (P < 0.007). On the other hand, the expression of the other hsps did not correlate with any obtainable patient clinical parameters. This study provides further evidence for the importance of hsps in melanoma and for their use as therapeutic targets and biomarkers, but larger-scale follow-up studies are required to confirm these results.

Abstract: Genomic abnormalities may accumulate in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) during in vitro maintenance. Characterization of the mechanisms enabling survival and expansion of abnormal hESCs is important due to consequences of genetic changes for the therapeutic utilization of stem cells. Furthermore, these cells provide an excellent model to study transformation in vitro. We report here that the histone deacetylase proteins, HDAC1 and HDAC2, are increased in karyotypically abnormal hESCs when compared to their normal counterparts. Importantly, similar to many cancer cell lines, we found that HDAC inhibitors repress proliferation of the karyotypically abnormal hESCs, whereas normal cells are more resistant to the treatment. The decreased proliferation correlates with downregulation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 proteins, induction of the proliferation inhibitor, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), and altered regulation of tumor suppressor protein Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Through genome-wide transcriptome analysis we have identified genes with altered expression and responsiveness to HDAC inhibition in abnormal cells. Most of these genes are linked to severe developmental and neurological diseases and cancers. Our results highlight the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of genomic stability of hESCs, and provide valuable candidates for targeted and selective growth inhibition of karyotypically abnormal cells.

Abstract: The clinical application of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) largely depends on their capacity to expand in vitro. We have conducted a comprehensive comparative proteomic analysis of culture-expanded hBMSCs obtained from different human donors. The data reveal extensive donor-to-donor proteomic heterogeneity. Processing and database-searching of the tandem MS data resulted in a most comprehensive to date proteomic dataset for hBMSC. A total of 7753 proteins including 712 transcription and translation regulators, 384 kinases, 248 receptor proteins, and 29 cytokines were confidently identified. The proteins identified are mainly nuclear (43.2%) and the share of proteins assigned to more than one subcellular location constitutes 10% of the identified proteome. Bioinformatics tools (IPA, DAVID, and PANTHER) were used to annotate proteins with respect to cellular locations, functions, and other physicochemical characteristics. We also compared the proteomic profile of hBMSCs to recently compiled datasets for human and mouse pluripotent stem cells. The result shows the extent of similarity between the three cell populations and also identified 253 proteins expressed uniformly by all lines of hBMSCs but not reported in the proteomic datasets of the two pluripotent stem cells. Overall, the proteomic database reported in this paper can serve as a reference map for extensive evaluation of hBMSC to explain their biology as well as identify possible marker candidates for further evaluation.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal microbiota features intricate metabolic interactions involving the breakdown and reuse of host- and diet-derived nutrients. The competition for these resources can limit pathogen growth. Nevertheless, some enteropathogenic bacteria can invade this niche through mechanisms that remain largely unclear. Using a mouse model for Salmonella diarrhea and a transposon mutant screen, we discovered that initial growth of Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Tm) in the unperturbed gut is powered by S. Tm hyb hydrogenase, which facilitates consumption of hydrogen (H2), a central intermediate of microbiota metabolism. In competitive infection experiments, a hyb mutant exhibited reduced growth early in infection compared to wild-type S. Tm, but these differences were lost upon antibiotic-mediated disruption of the host microbiota. Additionally, introducing H2-consuming bacteria into the microbiota interfered with hyb-dependent S. Tm growth. Thus, H2 is an Achilles’ heel of microbiota metabolism that can be subverted by pathogens and might offer opportunities to prevent infection.

Abstract: With intermittent renewable energy sources frequently producing more power than the existing electricity grid can handle, the need for a complete energy storage solution is becoming more acute. Electrolysis is increasingly being seen as a scalable technology that will meet this growing demand, and so Proton OnSite is looking to commercialise MW-scale proton-exchange membrane electrolyser systems for this key application.

Abstract: Summary
SOX2 is involved in several cell and developmental processes, including maintenance of embryonic stem cells, differentiation of neural progenitor cells, and patterning of gut endoderm. To study its role in a human system, we generated a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line harboring a reporter gene encoding GFP in the SOX2 locus. This SOX2 reporter line faithfully recapitulates expression of the SOX2 gene in undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and anterior foregut endoderm (AFE). In undifferentiated hESCs, GFP expression corresponds to those cells with highest levels of expression of genes associated with the pluripotent state. In NPCs, expression of GFP can be employed to isolate cells expressing markers associated with NPC multipotency. In AFE, we used transcriptome-wide expression analysis to identify cell surface markers with elevated expression in this population, thereby facilitating isolation and purification of this hPSC-derived cell population.

Abstract: Ischaemia associated reduction in local tissue pH is well documented but the mechanisms through which it influences cell survival remain poorly understood. Using renal epithelial HK-2 cells we demonstrate acidotic pH6.4 protects against oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) induced cell death. Initial exploration of the mechanisms responsible using microarray analysis revealed acidotic inhibition of OGD induced aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) gene expression. These genes are key components of protein translation, which was markedly attenuated by reduced pH. Inhibition of protein synthesis using the ARS inhibitor halofuginone or cycloheximide protected against OGD induced injury. To explore further we focussed on the transcription factor CREB, identified by pathway analysis of microarray data and observed a pH dependent decrease in OGD induced activation. Inhibition of CREB/CBP interaction prevented OGD induced isoleucyl-ARS (IARS) expression, reduced protein synthesis and protected against OGD induced cellular injury. In addition we also observed that acidotic pH attenuated the OGD induced pro-apoptotic unfolded protein response (UPR) activated gene DDIT3. We suggest that maladaptive activation of CREB and ARS gene expression, through the maintenance of protein synthesis contributes to ER stress and UPR activation and that acidotic pH through inhibition of CREB activation inhibits protein synthesis and ultimately UPR activated apoptotic signals.

Abstract: In allogenic and xenogenic transplantation, adequate immunosuppression plays a major role in graft survival, especially over the long term. The effect of immunosuppressive drugs on neural stem/progenitor cell fate has not been sufficiently explored. The focus of this study is to systematically investigate the effects of the following four different immunotherapeutic strategies on human neural progenitor cell survival/death, proliferation, metabolic activity, differentiation and migration in vitro: (1) cyclosporine A (CsA), a calcineurin inhibitor; (2) everolimus (RAD001), an mTOR-inhibitor; (3) mycophenolic acid (MPA, mycophenolate), an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and (4) prednisolone, a steroid. At the minimum effective concentration (MEC), we found a prominent decrease in hNPCs' proliferative capacity (BrdU incorporation), especially for CsA and MPA, and an alteration of the NAD(P)H-dependent metabolic activity. Cell death rate, neurogenesis, gliogenesis and cell migration remained mostly unaffected under these conditions for all four immunosuppressants, except for apoptotic cell death, which was significantly increased by MPA treatment.

Abstract: Although clusterin (CLU) was originally identified as a secreted glycoprotein that plays cytoprotective role, several intracellular CLU variants have been recently identified in the diverse pathological conditions. The mechanistic basis of these variants is now believed to be alternative splicing and retrotranslocation. Here, we uncovered, an unglycosylated and signal sequence-unprocessed, CLU variant in the cytosol. This variant proved to be a product that cotranslationally rerouted to the cytosol during translocation. Cytosolic CLU was prone to aggregation at peri-nuclear region of cells and induced cell death. Signal sequence is shown to be an important determinant for cytosolic CLU generation and aggregation. These results provide not only a new mechanistic insight into the cytosolic CLU generation but also an idea for therapeutic mislocalization of CLU as a strategy for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Translation is mediated partly by regulation of free eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) levels through PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. Cancer cells treated with the plant-derived perillyl alcohol (POH) or the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin dephosphorylate eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP1) and attenuate cap-dependent translation. We previously showed in cancer cell lines with elevated eIF4E that POH and rapamycin regulate telomerase activity through this pathway. Here, immortalized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) control cells and CHO cells with forced eIF4E expression (rb4E) were used to elucidate eIF4E's role in telomerase regulation by POH and rapamycin. Despite 5-fold higher eIF4E amounts in rb4E, telomerase activity, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mRNA, and TERT protein were nearly equivalent in control and rb4E cells. In control cells, telomerase activity, TERT mRNA and protein levels were unaffected by either compound. In contrast, telomerase activity and TERT protein were both attenuated by either agent in rb4E cells, but without corresponding TERT mRNA decreases indicating a translational/post-translational process. S6K, Akt, and 4E-BP1 were modulated by mTOR mediators only in the presence of increased eIF4E. Thus, eIF4E-overexpression in rb4E cells enables inhibitory effects of POH and rapamycin on telomerase and TERT protein. Importantly, eIF4E-overexpression modifies cellular protein synthetic processes and gene regulation.

Abstract: Using immuno-fluorescent probing and Western blotting analysis, we reveal the exclusive cytoplasm nature of the small subunit ribosomal protein S20. To illustrate the importance of the cellular compartmentation of S20 to the function of small subunit 40S, we created a nuclear resident S20NLS mutant gene and examined polysome profile of cells that had been transfected with the S20NLS gene. As a result, we observed the formation of recombinant 40S carried S20NLS but this recombinant 40S was never found in the polysome, suggesting such a recombinant 40S was translation incompetent. Moreover, by the tactic of the energy depletion and restoration, we were able to restrain the nuclear-resided S20NLS in the cytoplasm. Yet, along a progressive energy restoration, we observed the presence of recombinant 40S subunits carrying the S20NLS in the polysome. This proves that S20 needs to be cytoplasmic in order to make a functional 40S subunit. Furthermore, it also implies that the assembly order of ribosomal protein in eukaryote is orderly regulated.

Abstract: Summary
Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of adult T cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathies. In addition to T cells, HTLV-1 infects cells of the myeloid lineage, which play critical roles in the host innate response to viral infection. Investigating the monocyte depletion observed during HTLV-1 infection, we discovered that primary human monocytes infected with HTLV-1 undergo abortive infection accompanied by apoptosis dependent on SAMHD1, a host restriction factor that hydrolyzes endogenous dNTPs to below the levels required for productive reverse transcription. Reverse transcription intermediates (RTI) produced in the presence of SAMHD1 induced IRF3-mediated antiviral and apoptotic responses. Viral RTIs complexed with the DNA sensor STING to trigger formation of an IRF3-Bax complex leading to apoptosis. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for abortive HTLV-1 infection of monocytes and reports a link between SAMHD1 restriction, HTLV-1 RTI sensing by STING, and initiation of IRF3-Bax driven apoptosis.

Abstract: Recent studies suggested that miRNAs are involved in the development of the pathogenesis of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Rapamycin, a widely used mTOR inhibitor, has been demonstrated to slow down the progression of HIVAN. However, the role of miRNA in the regulation of these processes has not been investigated so far. In the current study, we have used a microarray-based approach in combination with real-time PCR to profile the miRNA expression patterns in rapamycin-treated HIVAN mice (Tg26). Our results demonstrated that 19 miRNAs belonging to 13 different families expressed differentially in renal tissues of rapamycin-receiving Tg26 mice when compared to Tg26 mice-receiving saline only. The patterns of miRNAs expression in rapamycin-receiving Tg26 mice took a reverse turn. These miRNAs were classified into 8 functional categories. In in vitro studies, we examined the expression of specific miRNAs in HIV-1 transduced human podocytes (HIV/HPs). HIV/HPs displayed attenuation of expression of miR-99a, -100a, -199a and miR-200, whereas, rapamycin inhibited this effect of HIV. These findings suggest that rapamycin-mediated up-regulation of specific miRNAs could contribute to amelioration of renal lesions in HIVAN mice.

Abstract: Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (bfCNs) which provide innervation to the hippocampus and cortex, are required for memory and learning, and are primarily affected in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), resulting in related cognitive decline. Therefore generation of a source of bfCNs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is crucial for in vitro disease modeling and development of novel AD therapies. In addition, for the advancement of regenerative approaches there is a requirement for an accurate developmental model to study the neurogenesis and survival of this population. Here we demonstrate the efficient production of bfCNs, using a novel embryoid body (EB) based non-adherent differentiation (NAdD) protocol. We establish a specific basal forebrain neural stem cell (NSC) phenotype via expression of the basal forebrain transcription factors NKX2.1 and LHX8, as well as the general forebrain marker FOXG1. We present evidence that this lineage is achieved via recapitulation of embryonic events, with induction of intrinsic hedgehog signaling, through the use of a 3D non-adherent differentiation system. This is the first example of hPSC-derived basal forebrain-like NSCs, which are scalable via self-renewal in prolonged culture. Furthermore upon terminal differentiation these basal forebrain-like NSCs generate high numbers of cholinergic neurons expressing the specific markers ChAT, VACht and ISL1. These hPSC-derived bfCNs possess characteristics that are crucial in a model to study AD related cholinergic neuronal loss in the basal forebrain. Examples are expression of the therapeutic target p75NTR, the release of acetylcholine, and demonstration of a mature, and functional electrophysiological profile. In conclusion, this work provides a renewable source of human functional bfCNs applicable for studying AD specifically in the cholinergic system, and also provides a model of the key embryonic events in human bfCN development.

Abstract: Stem cell (SC) therapy is the main treatment modality for patients with limbal stem cell deficiency. If limbal epithelial stem cells (LESC) can be more readily identified, isolated and maintained ex vivo, patients could be treated with better quality grafts. With prior knowledge that vitronectin (VN) is present within the LESC niche and that it supports LESC in vitro, we postulated that VN receptors (integrins αvβ3/5) are expressed by, and can be used to identify and isolate LESC. Immunolocalization studies were conducted on human corneas. Corneas were also used to expand limbal epithelial cells from either biopsies or enzyme-dissociated tissue and αvβ3/5 expression determined by flow cytometry. Integrin expressing cells were isolated by magnetic activated cell sorting then assessed by immunocytology, colony forming efficiency, RT-PCR and microarray analysis. Integrin αvβ5+ cells co-localized to N-cadherin+/CK-15+ putative LESC. αvβ5 was restricted to less than 4% of the total limbal epithelial cells, which expressed higher levels of CK-15 and formed more colonies compared to αvβ5− cells. Transcriptional profiling of αvβ5+/− cells by microarray identified several highly expressed interferon-inducible genes, which localize to putative LESC. Integrin αvβ5 is a candidate LESC marker since its expression is restricted to the limbus and αvβ5+ limbal epithelial cells have phenotypic and functional properties of LESC. Knowledge of the niche's molecular composition and the genes expressed by its SC will facilitate isolation and maintenance of these cells for therapeutic purposes.

Abstract: All-trans retinoic acid (RA) signals via binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs α, β, and γ). RA directly influences expression of Pdx1, a transcription factor essential for pancreatic development and beta-cell (β-cell) maturation. In this study we follow the differentiation of cultured wild-type (WT) vs. RARβ knockout (KO) embryonic stem (ES) cells into pancreatic islet cells. We found that RARβ KO ES cells show greatly reduced expression of some important endocrine markers of differentiated islet cells, such as glucagon, islet amyloid polypeptide (Iapp), and insulin 1 (Ins1) relative to WT. We conclude that RARβ activity is essential for proper differentiation of ES cells to pancreatic endocrine cells.

Abstract: Perinatal hypoxia–ischemia (HI) results in brain injury, whereas mild hypoxic episodes result in preconditioning, which can significantly reduce the vulnerability of the brain to subsequent severe hypoxia–ischemia. Hypoxic-preconditioning (PC) has been shown to enhance cell survival and differentiation of progenitor cells in the central nervous system (CNS). The purpose of this study was to determine whether pretreatment with PC prior to HI stimulates subventricular zone (SVZ) proliferation and neurogenesis in newborn piglets. One-day-old piglets were subjected to PC (8% O2/92% N2) for 3h and 24h later were exposed to HI produced by combination of hypoxia (5% FiO2) for a pre-defined period of 30min and ischemia induced by a period of 10min of hypotension. Here we demonstrate that SVZ derived neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPs) from PC, HI and PC+HI piglets proliferated as neurospheres, expressed neural progenitor and neurodevelopmental markers, and that greater proportion of the spheres generated are multipotential. Neurosphere assay revealed that preconditioning pretreatment increased the number of NSP-derived neurospheres in SVZ following HI compared to normoxic and HI controls. NSPs from preconditioned SVZ generated twice as many neurons and astrocytes in vitro. Injections with 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) after PC revealed a robust proliferative response within the SVZ that continued for one week. PC also increased neurogenesis in vivo, doublecortin positive cells with migratory profiles were observed streaming from the SVZ to striatum and neocortex. These findings show that the induction of proliferation and neurogenesis by PC might be a positive adaptation for an efficient repair and plasticity in the event of a hypoxic–ischemic insult.

Abstract: Summary
Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) causes an aggressive human skin cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, through expression of small T (sT) and large T (LT) viral oncoproteins. MCV sT is also required for efficient MCV DNA replication by the multifunctional MCV LT helicase protein. We find that LT is targeted for proteasomal degradation by the cellular SCFFbw7 E3 ligase, which can be inhibited by sT through its LT-stabilization domain (LSD). Consequently, sT also stabilizes cellular SCFFbw7 targets, including the cell-cycle regulators c-Myc and cyclin E. Mutating the sT LSD decreases LT protein levels and eliminates synergism in MCV DNA replication as well as sT-induced cell transformation. SCFFbw7 knockdown mimics sT-mediated stabilization of LT, but this knockdown is insufficient to fully reconstitute the transforming activity of a mutant LSD sT protein. Thus, MCV has evolved a regulatory system involving SCFFbw7 that controls viral replication but also contributes to host cell transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolites are emerging as key mediators of crosstalk between metabolic flux, cellular signaling, and epigenetic regulation of cell fate. We found that the nonessential amino acid L-proline (L-Pro) acts as a signaling molecule that promotes the conversion of embryonic stem cells into mesenchymal-like, spindle-shaped, highly motile, invasive pluripotent stem cells. This embryonic-stem-cell-to-mesenchymal-like transition (esMT) is accompanied by a genome-wide remodeling of the H3K9 and H3K36 methylation status. Consistently, L-Pro-induced esMT is fully reversible either after L-Pro withdrawal or by addition of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which in turn reduces H3K9 and H3K36 methylation, promoting a mesenchymal-like-to-embryonic-stem-cell transition (MesT). These findings suggest that L-Pro, which is produced by proteolytic remodeling of the extracellular matrix, may act as a microenvironmental cue to control stem cell behavior.

Abstract: Eukaryotic cells respond to stress caused by the accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum by activating the intracellular signaling pathways referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR). In metazoans, UPR consists of three parallel branches, each characterized by its stress sensor protein, IRE1, ATF6, and PERK, respectively. In Drosophila, IRE1/XBP1 pathway is considered to function as a major branch of UPR; however, its physiological roles during the normal development and homeostasis remain poorly understood. To visualize IRE1/XBP1 activity in fly tissues under normal physiological conditions, we modified previously reported XBP1 stress sensing systems (Souid et al., Dev Genes Evol 217: 159–167, 2007; Ryoo et al., EMBO J 26: 242-252, 2007), based on the recent reports regarding the unconventional splicing of XBP1/HAC1 mRNA (Aragon et al., Nature 457: 736–740, 2009; Yanagitani et al., Mol Cell 34: 191–200, 2009; Science 331: 586–589, 2011). The improved XBP1 stress sensing system allowed us to detect new IRE1/XBP1 activities in the brain, gut, Malpighian tubules, and trachea of third instar larvae and in the adult male reproductive organ. Specifically, in the larval brain, IRE1/XBP1 activity was detected exclusively in glia, although previous reports have largely focused on IRE1/XBP1 activity in neurons. Unexpected glial IRE1/XBP1 activity may provide us with novel insights into the brain homeostasis regulated by the UPR.

Abstract: Keshan disease (KD) is an endemic dilated cardiomyopathy with unclear etiology. In this study, we compared mitochondrial-related gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from 16 KD patients and 16 normal controls in KD areas. Total RNA was isolated, amplified, labeled and hybridized to Agilent human 4×44k whole genome microarrays. Mitochondrial-related genes were screened out by the Third-Generation Human Mitochondria-Focused cDNA Microarray (hMitChip3). Quantitative real-time PCR, immunohistochemical and biochemical parameters related mitochondrial metabolism were conducted to validate our microarray results. In KD samples, 34 up-regulated genes (ratios≥2.0) were detected by significance analysis of microarrays and ingenuity systems pathway analysis (IPA). The highest ranked molecular and cellular functions of the differentially regulated genes were closely related to amino acid metabolism, free radical scavenging, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy production. Using IPA, 40 significant pathways and four significant networks, involved mainly in apoptosis, mitochondrion dysfunction, and nuclear receptor signaling were identified. Based on our results, we suggest that PGC-1alpha regulated energy metabolism and anti-apoptosis might play an important role in the compensatory mechanism of KD. Our results may lead to the identification of potential diagnostic biomarkers for KD in PBMCs, and may help to understand the pathogenesis of KD.

Abstract: To assess the consequences of inactivation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) during aging, we analyzed the effect of HSF1 K80Q, a mutant unable to bind DNA, and of dnHSF1, a mutant lacking the activation domain, on the transcriptome of cells 6 and 24 h after heat shock. The primary response to heat shock (6 h recovery), of which 30 % was HSF1-dependent, had decayed 24 h after heat shock in control cells but was extended in HSF1 K80Q and dnHSF1 cells. Comparison with literature data showed that even the HSF1 dependent primary stress response is largely cell specific. HSF1 K80Q, but not HSF1 siRNA-treated, cells showed a delayed stress response: an increase in transcript levels of HSF1 target genes 24 h after heat stress. Knockdown of NRF2, but not of ATF4, c-Fos or FosB, inhibited this delayed stress response. EEF1D_L siRNA inhibited both the delayed and the extended primary stress responses, but had off target effects. In control cells an antioxidant response (ARE binding, HMOX1 mRNA levels) was detected 6 h after heat shock; in HSF1 K80Q cells this response was delayed to 24 h and the ARE complex had a different mobility. Inactivation of HSF1 thus affects the timing and nature of the antioxidant response and NRF2 can activate at least some HSF1 target genes in the absence of HSF1 activity.

Abstract: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can proliferate indefinitely in vitro and differentiate into cells of all three germ layers. These unique properties make them exceptionally valuable for drug discovery and regenerative medicine. However, the practical application of ESCs is limited because it is difficult to derive and culture ESCs. It has been demonstrated that CHIR99021 (CHIR) promotes self-renewal and enhances the derivation efficiency of mouse (m)ESCs. However, the downstream targets of CHIR are not fully understood. In this study, we identified CHIR-regulated genes in mESCs using microarray analysis. Our microarray data demonstrated that CHIR not only influenced the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by stabilizing β-catenin, but also modulated several other pluripotency-related signaling pathways such as TGF-β, Notch and MAPK signaling pathways. More detailed analysis demonstrated that CHIR inhibited Nodal signaling, while activating bone morphogenetic protein signaling in mESCs. In addition, we found that pluripotency-maintaining transcription factors were up-regulated by CHIR, while several developmental-related genes were down-regulated. Furthermore, we found that CHIR altered the expression of epigenetic regulatory genes and long intergenic non-coding RNAs. Quantitative real-time PCR results were consistent with microarray data, suggesting that CHIR alters the expression pattern of protein-encoding genes (especially transcription factors), epigenetic regulatory genes and non-coding RNAs to establish a relatively stable pluripotency-maintaining network.

Abstract: Using a glutathione S-transferase pull-down liquid chromatography–coupled tandem mass spectrometry approach and immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis, we found that heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) was involved in the complex formed by atypical protein kinase Cι (PKCι) and LC3 in the esophageal cancer cell line KYSE30. Further study indicated that Hsc70 was targeted by autophagic degradation, and knockdown of PKCι down-regulated Hsc70 by promoting autophagy. PKCι knockdown sensitized cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, whereas forced PKCι expression counteracted the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis via Hsc70.

Abstract: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disease of the heart muscle characterized by cardiac chamber enlargement and reduced systolic function of the left ventricle. Mutations in the LMNA gene represent the most frequent known genetic cause of DCM associated with disease of the conduction systems. The LMNA gene generates two major transcripts encoding the nuclear lamina major components lamin A and lamin C by alternative splicing. Both haploinsuffiency and dominant negative effects have been proposed as disease mechanism for premature termination codon (PTC) mutations in LMNA. These mechanisms however are still not clearly established. In this study, we used a representative LMNA nonsense mutation, p.Arg321Ter, to shed light on the molecular disease mechanisms. Cultured fibroblasts from three DCM patients carrying this mutation were analyzed. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and sequencing of these PCR products indicated that transcripts from the mutant allele were degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) mechanism. The fact that no truncated mutant protein was detectable in western blot (WB) analysis strengthens the notion that the mutant transcript is efficiently degraded. Furthermore, WB analysis showed that the expression of lamin C protein was reduced by the expected approximately 50%. Clearly decreased lamin A and lamin C levels were also observed by immunofluorescence microscopy analysis. However, results from both WB and nano-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry demonstrated that the levels of lamin A protein were more reduced suggesting an effect on expression of lamin A from the wild type allele. PCR analysis of the ratio of lamin A to lamin C transcripts showed unchanged relative amounts of lamin A transcript suggesting that the effect on the wild type allele was operative at the protein level. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis showed no abnormal nuclear morphology of patient fibroblast cells. Based on these data, we propose that heterozygosity for the nonsense mutation causes NMD degradation of the mutant transcripts blocking expression of the truncated mutant protein and an additional trans effect on lamin A protein levels expressed from the wild type allele. We discuss the possibility that skewing of the lamin A to lamin C ratio may contribute to ensuing processes that destabilize cardiomyocytes and trigger cardiomyopathy

Abstract: Summary
Various C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), including Mincle and Dectin-2, function as pattern recognition receptors and play a central role in immunity to fungal pathogens. However, the precise structures of the CLR ligands in various pathogenic fungi have yet to be completely defined. Here we report that Malassezia, an opportunistic skin fungal pathogen, is cooperatively recognized by Mincle and Dectin-2 through distinct ligands. Solvent-based fractionation revealed that Mincle and Dectin-2 recognize lipophilic and hydrophilic components of Malassezia, respectively. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed glyceroglycolipid and unique mannosyl fatty acids linked to mannitol as two Mincle ligands. An O-linked mannobiose-rich glycoprotein was identified as a Malassezia ligand for Dectin-2. Cytokine production in response to the Mincle ligands and the Dectin-2 ligand was abrogated in Mincle−/− and Dectin-2−/− dendritic cells, respectively. These results demonstrate that Mincle and Dectin-2 recognize distinct ligands in Malassezia to induce host immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and type 1 interferon (T1-IFN) signaling are innate immune mechanisms activated upon viral infection. However, the role of NF-κB and its interplay with T1-IFN in antiviral immunity is poorly understood. We show that NF-κB is essential for resistance to ectromelia virus (ECTV), a mouse orthopoxvirus related to the virus causing human smallpox. Additionally, an ECTV mutant lacking an NF-κB inhibitor activates NF-κB more effectively in vivo, resulting in increased proinflammatory molecule transcription in uninfected cells and organs and decreased viral replication. Unexpectedly, NF-κB activation compensates for genetic defects in the T1-IFN pathway, such as a deficiency in the IRF7 transcription factor, resulting in virus control. Thus, overlap between the T1-IFN and NF-κB pathways allows the host to overcome genetic or pathogen-induced deficiencies in T1-IFN and survive an otherwise lethal poxvirus infection. These findings may also explain why some pathogens target both pathways to cause disease.

Abstract: In addition to potent anticancer effects of selenite, a modest therapeutic effect of sodium selenate has been demonstrated in prostate cancer patients. Selenate acts by activating protein phosphatase 2A, which inhibits various signal transduction cascades, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. The human colorectal carcinoma cell line DLD-1 harbors a constitutive active mutation in PIK3CA encoding the PI3K p110α catalytic subunit. Thus, we examined the anticancer effect of sodium selenate in DLD-1 cells. As expected, selenate significantly decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis at a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.88mM, whereas selenite was much more potent at an IC50 of 0.0061mM. Surprisingly, at lower concentrations (0.04–0.16mM), selenate induced changes in cell morphology and motility that are characteristic of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, selenate-induced EMT was associated with AKT activation, increased expression of the EMT-inducing transcription factor TWIST1 and the mesenchymal cell-specific intermediate filament vimentin, and decreased expression of the epithelial cell-specific adhesion molecule E-cadherin. The critical role of AKT activation in selenate-induced EMT was identified using the AKT inhibitor Akti-1/2, which suppressed EMT-associated cell motility and invasion. These results suggest that although sodium selenate is a potential anticancer drug, deleterious effects of EMT induction should be taken into careful consideration.

Abstract: Summary
XopD, a type III secretion effector from Xanthomonas euvesicatoria (Xcv), the causal agent of bacterial spot of tomato, is required for pathogen growth and delay of host symptom development. XopD carries a C-terminal SUMO protease domain, a host range determining nonspecific DNA-binding domain and two EAR motifs typically found in repressors of stress-induced transcription. The precise target(s) and mechanism(s) of XopD are obscure. We report that XopD directly targets the tomato ethylene responsive transcription factor SlERF4 to suppress ethylene production, which is required for anti-Xcv immunity and symptom development. SlERF4 expression was required for Xcv ΔxopD-induced ethylene production and ethylene-stimulated immunity. XopD colocalized with SlERF4 in subnuclear foci and catalyzed SUMO1 hydrolysis from lysine 53 of SlERF4, causing SlERF4 destabilization. Mutation of lysine 53 prevented SlERF4 sumoylation, decreased SlERF4 levels, and reduced SlERF4 transcription. These data suggest that XopD desumoylates SlERF4 to repress ethylene-induced transcription required for anti-Xcv immunity.

Abstract: In the present study, we examined the effect of the over-expression of LMNA, or its mutant form progerin (PG), on the mesoderm differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from human umbilical cord (UC) stroma using a recently described differentiation model employing spheroid formation. Accumulation of lamin A (LMNA) was previously associated with the osteoarthritis (OA) chondrocyte phenotype. Mutations of this protein are linked to laminopathies and specifically to Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), an accelerated aging disease. Some authors have proposed that a deregulation of LMNA affects the differentiation potential of stem cells. The chondrogenic potential is defective in PG-MSCs, although both PG and LMNA transduced MSCs, have an increase in hypertrophy markers during chondrogenic differentiation. Furthermore, both PG and LMNA-MSCs showed a decrease in manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSODM), an increase of mitochondrial MnSODM-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alterations in their migration capacity. Finally, defects in chondrogenesis are partially reversed by periodic incubation with ROS-scavenger agent that mimics MnSODM effect. Our results indicate that over-expression of LMNA or PG by lentiviral gene delivery leads to defects in chondrogenic differentiation potential partially due to an imbalance in oxidative stress.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cold stress on the expression levels of heat shock proteins (Hsps90, 70, 60, 40, and 27) and inflammatory factors (iNOS, COX-2, NF-κB, TNF-α, and PTGEs) and oxidative indexes in hearts of chickens. Two hundred forty 15-day-old male chickens were randomly divided into 12 groups and kept at the temperature of 12 ± 1°C for acute and chronic cold stress. There were one control group and five treatment groups for acute cold stress, three control groups, and three treatment groups for chronic cold stress. After cold stress, malondialdehyde level increased in chicken heart; the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the heart first increased and then decreased. The inflammatory factors mRNA levels were increased in cold stress groups relative to control groups. The histopathological analysis showed that heart tissues were seriously injured in the cold stress group. Additionally, the mRNA levels of Hsps (70, 60, 40, and 27) increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the cold stress groups relative to the corresponding control group. Meanwhile, the mRNA level and protein expression of Hsp90 decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in the stress group, and showed a gradually decreasing tendency. These results suggested that the levels of inflammatory factors and Hsps expression levels in heart tissues can be influenced by cold stress. Hsps commonly played an important role in the protection of the heart after cold stress.

Abstract: Formation of the neural tube is the morphological hallmark for development of the embryonic central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, neural tube development is a crucial step in the neurulation process. Slit/Robo signaling was initially identified as a chemo-repellent that regulated axon growth cone elongation, but its role in controlling neural tube development is currently unknown. To address this issue, we investigated Slit/Robo1 signaling in the development of chick neCollege of Life Sciences Biocentre, University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 5EH, UKural tube and transgenic mice over-expressing Slit2. We disrupted Slit/Robo1 signaling by injecting R5 monoclonal antibodies into HH10 neural tubes to block the Robo1 receptor. This inhibited the normal development of the ventral body curvature and caused the spinal cord to curl up into a S-shape. Next, Slit/Robo1 signaling on one half-side of the chick embryo neural tube was disturbed by electroporation in ovo. We found that the morphology of the neural tube was dramatically abnormal after we interfered with Slit/Robo1 signaling. Furthermore, we established that silencing Robo1 inhibited cell proliferation while over-expressing Robo1 enhanced cell proliferation. We also investigated the effects of altering Slit/Robo1 expression on Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and Pax7 expression in the developing neural tube. We demonstrated that over-expressing Robo1 down-regulated Shh expression in the ventral neural tube and resulted in the production of fewer HNK-1+ migrating neural crest cells (NCCs). In addition, Robo1 over-expression enhanced Pax7 expression in the dorsal neural tube and increased the number of Slug+ pre-migratory NCCs. Conversely, silencing Robo1 expression resulted in an enhanced Shh expression and more HNK-1+ migrating NCCs but reduced Pax7 expression and fewer Slug+ pre-migratory NCCs were observed. In conclusion, we propose that Slit/Robo1 signaling is involved in regulating neural tube development by tightly coordinating cell proliferation and differentiation during neurulation.

Abstract: We previously found that endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) might be exhibited in the conventional protocol of the primary culture of neonate rat myocardial cells (NRMCs) and that the high glucose concentration (25 mmol/L) in the culture medium might be the cause. Here, we investigated if the high concentration of glucose might influence ERS in myocardial cells during culture. GRP78 expression (ERS marker) was similar in groups with tunicamycin (TM) and without TM in high glucose cultured cells (p > 0.01). Different glucose concentrations elicited different GRP78 expressions according to analyses of protein and RNA levels, which showed ERS in H/H groups. Finally, we found that GRP78 expression was higher in TM groups compared with M/M groups (p < 0.01). The conventional high-glucose culture media during primary culture of NRMCs induced ERS. We propose that medium-glucose culture media should be used and describe an improved protocol for the primary culture of NRMCs.

Abstract: MicroRNA-137 (miR-137) has been shown to play an important role in the differentiation of neural stem cells. Embryonic stem (ES) cells have the potential to differentiate into different cell types including neurons; however, the contribution of miR-137 in the maintenance and differentiation of ES cells remains unknown. Here, we show that miR-137 is mainly expressed in ES cells at the mitotic phase of the cell cycle and highly upregulated during differentiation. We identify that ES cell transcription factors, Klf4 and Tbx3, are downstream targets of miR-137, and we show that endogenous miR-137 represses the 3′ untranslated regions of Klf4 and Tbx3. Transfection of ES cells with mature miR-137 RNA duplexes led to a significant reduction in cell proliferation and the expression of Klf4, Tbx3, and other self-renewal genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increased miR-137 expression accelerates differentiation of ES cells in vitro. Loss of miR-137 during ES cell differentiation significantly impeded neuronal gene expression and morphogenesis. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-137 regulates ES cell proliferation and differentiation by repressing the expression of downstream targets, including Klf4 and Tbx3.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multilineage progenitors with immunomodulatory properties, including expansion of immunomodulatory leukocytes such as regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) and tolerogenic dendritic cells. We report that human MSCs can expand CD14−CD11b+CD33+ human myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MSC-expanded MDSCs suppress allogeneic lymphocyte proliferation, express arginase-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and increase the number of Tregs. This expansion occurs through the secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), with effects replicated by adding HGF singly and abrogated by HGF knockdown in MSCs. In wild-type mice, the liver, which secretes high levels of HGF, contains high numbers of Gr-1+CD11b+ MDSCs, and injection of HGF into mice significantly increases the number of MDSCs. Expansion of MDSCs by MSC-secreted HGF involves c-Met (its receptor) and downstream phosphorylation of STAT3, a key factor in MDSC expansion. Our data further support the strong immunomodulatory nature of MSCs and demonstrate the role of HGF, a mitogenic molecule, in the expansion of MDSCs.

Abstract: Adipocyte stem cells (hASCs) can proliferate and self-renew and, due to their multipotent nature, they can differentiate into several tissue-specific lineages, making them ideal candidates for use in cell therapy. Most attempts to determine the mRNA profile of self-renewing or differentiating stem cells have made use of total RNA for gene expression analysis. Several lines of evidence suggest that self-renewal and differentiation are also dependent on the control of protein synthesis by posttranscriptional mechanisms. We used adipogenic differentiation as a model, to investigate the extent to which posttranscriptional regulation controlled gene expression in hASCs. We focused on the initial steps of differentiation and isolated both the total mRNA fraction and the subpopulation of mRNAs associated with translating ribosomes. We observed that adipogenesis is committed in the first days of induction and three days appears as the minimum time of induction necessary for efficient differentiation. RNA-seq analysis showed that a significant percentage of regulated mRNAs were posttranscriptionally controlled. Part of this regulation involves massive changes in transcript untranslated regions (UTR) length, with differential extension/reduction of the 3′UTR after induction. A slight correlation can be observed between the expression levels of differentially expressed genes and the 3′UTR length. When we considered association to polysomes, this correlation values increased. Changes in the half lives were related to the extension of the 3′UTR, with longer UTRs mainly stabilizing the transcripts. Thus, changes in the length of these extensions may be associated with changes in the ability to associate with polysomes or in half-life.

Abstract: Inhibition of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) apoptosis induced by hypoxia plays an important role in pulmonary arterial remodeling leading to aggravate hypoxic pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, the mechanisms of hypoxia acting on PASMC apoptosis remain exclusive. Biliverdin reductase (BVR) has many essential biologic roles in physiological and pathological processes. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the hypoxia-induced inhibition on PASMC apoptosis is mediated by BVR. In the present work, we found BVR majorly localized in PASMCs and was up-regulated in levels of protein and mRNA by hypoxia. Then we studied the contribution of BVR to anti-apoptotic response of hypoxia in PASMCs. Our results showed that siBVR, blocking generation of bilirubin, reversed the effect of hypoxia on enhancing cell survival and apoptotic protein (Bcl-2, procasepase-9, procasepase-3) expression, preventing nuclear shrinkage, DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial depolarization in starved PASMCs, which were recovered by exogenous bilirubin. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of bilirubin on PASMC apoptosis under hypoxic condition was blocked by the inhibitor of ERK1/2 pathway. Taken together, our data indicate that BVR contributes to the inhibitory process of hypoxia on PASMC apoptosis, which is mediated by bilirubin through ERK1/2 pathway.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a reliable resource for tissue regeneration, but the molecular mechanism underlying directed differentiation remains unclear; this has restricted potential MSC applications. The histone demethylase, lysine (K)-specific demethylase 2A (KDM2A), is evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed members of the JmjC-domain-containing histone demethylase family. A previous study determined that KDM2A can regulate the cell proliferation and osteo/dentinogenic differentiation of MSCs. It is not known whether KDM2A is involved in the other cell lineages differentiation of MSCs. Here, we show that depletion of KDM2A by short hairpin RNAs can enhance adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potentials in human stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs). We found that the stemness-related genes, SOX2, and the embryonic stem cell master transcription factor, NANOG were significantly increased after silence of KDM2A in SCAPs. Moreover, we found that knock-down of the KDM2A co-factor, BCOR also up-regulated the mRNA levels of SOX2 and NANOG. Furthermore, Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that silence of KDM2A increased the histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) trimethylation in the SOX2 and NANOG locus and regulates its expression. In conclusion, our results suggested that depletion of KDM2A enhanced the adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potentials of SCAPs by up-regulated SOX2 and NANOG, BCOR also involved in this regulation as co-factor, and provided useful information to understand the molecular mechanism underlying directed differentiation in MSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Vesicle-membrane-protein-associated protein A (VAPA) and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) regulate intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, which is required for many virus infections. During entry, viruses or virus-containing vesicles can fuse with endosomal membranes to mediate the cytosolic release of virions, and alterations in endosomal cholesterol can inhibit this invasion step. We show that the antiviral effector protein interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) interacts with VAPA and prevents its association with OSBP, thereby disrupting intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and inhibiting viral entry. By altering VAPA-OSBP function, IFITM3 induces a marked accumulation of cholesterol in multivesicular bodies and late endosomes, which inhibits the fusion of intraluminal virion-containing vesicles with endosomal membranes and thereby blocks virus release into the cytosol. Consequently, ectopic expression or depletion of the VAPA gene profoundly affects IFITM3-mediated inhibition of viral entry. Thus, IFITM3 disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis to block viral entry, further underscoring the importance of cholesterol in virus infection.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great promise for the field of tissue regeneration. Because only a limited number of MSCs can be obtained from each donor site, it is important to establish standard methods for MSC expansion using growth and trophic factors. Thymosin β4 (Tβ4) is a novel trophic factor that has antimicrobial effects and the potential to promote tissue repair. Tβ4 is a ubiquitous, naturally-occurring peptide in the wound bed. Therefore, the relationship between Tβ4 and MSCs, especially adjacent adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs), merits consideration. Exogenous Tβ4 treatment enhanced the proliferation of human ASCs, resulting in prominent nuclear localization of PCNA immunoreactivity. In addition, exogenous Tβ4 also increased IL-8 secretion and blocking of IL-8 with neutralizing antibodies decreased Tβ4-induced ASC proliferation, suggesting that IL-8 is a critical mediator of Tβ4-enhanced proliferation. Moreover, Tβ4 activated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and increased the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. These observation provide that Tβ4 promotes the expansion of human ASCs via an IL-8-dependent mechanism that involves the ERK and NF-κB pathways. Therefore, Tβ4 could be used as a tool for MSC expansion in cell therapeutics.

Abstract: Human adipose derived stem cells (hASCs) can be easily isolated and their plasticity has been well characterized. Several TGF-β superfamily ligands can direct hASCs towards chondrocytes. However, these ligands are difficult to purify and expensive. We have developed a library of Activin/BMP2 chimeric ligands (AB2 ligands) by systematically mixing their sequence segments and have tested their chondrogenic potential in hASCs. Cells cultured in monolayer or in a pellet culture system were incubated with a chemically defined medium supplemented with the chimeric ligands for 4 or 6weeks and showed higher expression levels of type II collagen, aggrecan, and Sox9 mRNAs when compared with control and non-treated cells. Moreover, toluidine blue, alcian blue, and Masson's trichrome staining was markedly increased in treated cells, both in cell pellet and monolayer assays. In addition, immunohistochemical staining for detection of type I collagen, type II collagen, and Sox 9 demonstrated the acquisition of a chondrogenic phenotype in both culture systems. We present here an inexpensive and robust protocol for differentiation of hASCs towards chondrocytes in a reproducible and highly efficient manner. The AB2 ligands employed are easily produced and have properties that may become useful in cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum establishes in the host erythrocyte plasma membrane new permeability pathways that mediate nutrient uptake into the infected cell. These pathways simultaneously allow Na+ influx, causing [Na+] in the infected erythrocyte cytosol to increase to high levels. The intraerythrocytic parasite itself maintains a low cytosolic [Na+] via unknown mechanisms. Here we present evidence that the intraerythrocytic parasite actively extrudes Na+ against an inward gradient via PfATP4, a parasite plasma membrane protein with sequence similarities to Na+-ATPases of lower eukaryotes. Mutations in PfATP4 confer resistance to a potent class of antimalarials, the spiroindolones. Consistent with this, the spiroindolones cause a profound disruption in parasite Na+ homeostasis, which is attenuated in parasites bearing resistance-conferring mutations in PfATP4. The mutant parasites also show some impairment of Na+ regulation. Taken together, our results are consistent with PfATP4 being a Na+ efflux ATPase and a target of the spiroindolones.

Abstract: Summary
Upon activation by the ligands Gas6 and Protein S, Tyro3/Axl/Mer (TAM) receptor tyrosine kinases promote phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells and downregulate immune responses initiated by Toll-like receptors and type I interferons (IFNs). Many enveloped viruses display the phospholipid phosphatidylserine on their membranes, through which they bind Gas6 and Protein S and engage TAM receptors. We find that ligand-coated viruses activate TAM receptors on dendritic cells (DCs), dampen type I IFN signaling, and thereby evade host immunity and promote infection. Upon virus challenge, TAM-deficient DCs display type I IFN responses that are elevated in comparison to wild-type cells. As a consequence, TAM-deficient DCs are relatively resistant to infection by flaviviruses and pseudotyped retroviruses, but infection can be restored with neutralizing type I IFN antibodies. Correspondingly, a TAM kinase inhibitor antagonizes the infection of wild-type DCs. Thus, TAM receptors are engaged by viruses in order to attenuate type I IFN signaling and represent potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Oxidative stress may be the most significant threat to the survival of living organisms. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) serve as the primary defences against xenobiotic and peroxidative-induced oxidative damage. In contrast to other well-defined GST classes, the Omega-class members are poorly understood, particularly in insects. Here, we isolated and characterised the GSTO2 gene from Apis cerana cerana (AccGSTO2). The predicted transcription factor binding sites in the AccGSTO2 promoter suggested possible functions in early development and antioxidant defence. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot analyses indicated that AccGSTO2 was highly expressed in larvae and was predominantly localised to the brain tissue in adults. Moreover, AccGSTO2 transcription was induced by various abiotic stresses. The purified recombinant AccGSTO2 exhibited glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase and peroxidase activities. Furthermore, it could prevent DNA damage. In addition, Escherichia coli overexpressing AccGSTO2 displayed resistance to long-term oxidative stress exposure in disc diffusion assays. Taken together, these results suggest that AccGSTO2 plays a protective role in counteracting oxidative stress.

Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) plays a role in the anti-tumorigenic effects of 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AZA) in breast cancer cells,

Abstract: Breast cancer progression is associated with loss of estrogen receptor (ER-α), often due to epigenetic silencing. IGFBP genes have consistently been identified among the most common to be aberrantly methylated in tumours. To understand the impact of losing IGFBP-3 tumour expression via DNA methylation, we treated four breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, Hs578T and MDA-MB-231) with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AZA) to determine IGFBP-3's role in the effects of AZA on total cell number and survival relative to changes in the ER. AZA induced cell growth inhibition, death and a reduction in the formation of colonies, despite increasing ER-α expression in ER-negative cells but reducing ER-α in ER-positive cells. Regardless of the differential effects on the ER-α, AZA consistently increased the abundance of IGFBP-3 and negating this increase in IGFBP-3 with siRNA reduced the AZA-induced growth inhibition and induction of cell death and virtually negated the AZA-induced inhibition of colony formation. With ER-α positive cells AZA increased the abundance of the tumour suppressor gene, p53 and induced demethylation of the IGFBP-3 promoter, whereas with ER negative cells, AZA epigenetically increased the transcription factor AP2-α, which when silenced prevented the increase in IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3 plays an important role in the anti-tumorigenic effects of AZA on breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss and blindness among the elderly population in the industrialized world. One of the typical features of this pathology is the gradual death of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which are essential for maintaining photoreceptor functions and survival. The etiology is multifactorial, and oxidative stress is clearly one of the key factors involved in disease pathogenesis (Plafker, Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 664 (2010) 447–56; Qin, Drug Dev. Res. 68 (2007) 213–225). Recent work has revealed the presence of phosphorylated signaling proteins in the vitreous humour of patients affected by AMD or other retinal diseases. While the location of these signaling proteins is typically the cell membrane or intracellular compartments, vitreous samples were proven to be cell-free (Davuluri et al., Arch. Ophthalmol. 127 (2009) 613–21). To gain a better understanding of how these proteins can be shed into the vitreous, we used reverse phase protein arrays (RPMA) to analyze the protein and phosphoprotein content of exosomes shed by cultured ARPE-19 cells under oxidative stress conditions. Seventy two proteins were shown to be released by ARPE-19 cells and compartmentalized within exosomes. Forty one of them were selectively detected in their post-translationally modified form (i.e., phosphorylated or cleaved) for the first time in exosomes. Sets of these proteins were linked together reflecting activation of pathway units within exosomes. A subset of (phospho)proteins were altered in exosomes secreted by ARPE-19 cells subjected to oxidative stress, compared to that secreted by control/non stressed cells. Stress-altered exosome proteins were found to be involved in pathways regulating apoptosis/survival (i.e, Bak, Smac/Diablo, PDK1 (S241), Akt (T308), Src (Y416), Elk1 (S383), ERK 1/2 (T202/Y204)) and cell metabolism (i.e., AMPKα1 (S485), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (S79), LDHA). Exosomes may thus represent the conduit through which membrane and intracellular signaling proteins are released into the vitreous. Changes in their (phospho)protein content upon stress conditions suggest their possible role in mediating cell–cell signaling during physio-pathological events; furthermore, exosomes may represent a potential source of biomarkers.

Abstract: Oxidative stress and cellular injury have been implicated in induction of HSP72 by alcohol. We investigated the association between HSP72 induction and oxidative stress in mouse tissues following short-term administration of high doses of alcohol and caffeine alone or in combination. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were gavaged with vehicle, alcohol (∼1.7 g/kg/day), caffeine (∼44 mg/kg/day), or alcohol plus caffeine once daily for ten consecutive days. Upon completion of the treatments, tissues were collected for structural and biochemical analyses. Alcohol alone caused mild to moderate lesions in heart, liver, and gastrocnemius muscle. Similar structural changes were observed following administration of alcohol and caffeine combined. Alcohol administration also led to decreased glutathione levels in all three tissues and reduced plasma superoxide dismutase capacity. In contrast, alcohol and caffeine in combination reduced glutathione levels only in liver and gastrocnemius muscle and had no effect on plasma superoxide dismutase. Significant elevations in HSP72 protein and mRNA and in HSF1 protein levels were noted only in liver by alcohol alone or in combination with caffeine. No significant changes in morphology and HSP72 were detected in any tissues tested following administration of caffeine alone. These results suggest that a redox mechanism is involved in the structural impairment caused by short-term high-dose alcohol. Oxidative tissue injury by alcohol may not be associated with tissue HSP72 induction. Induction of HSP72 in liver by alcohol is mediated at both the transcriptional and translational levels.

Abstract: Summary
Biotrophic plant pathogens encounter a postinfection basal resistance layer controlled by the lipase-like protein enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) and its sequence-related interaction partners, senescence-associated gene 101 (SAG101) and phytoalexin deficient 4 (PAD4). Maintainance of separate EDS1 family member clades through angiosperm evolution suggests distinct functional attributes. We report the Arabidopsis EDS1-SAG101 heterodimer crystal structure with juxtaposed N-terminal α/β hydrolase and C-terminal α-helical EP domains aligned via a large conserved interface. Mutational analysis of the EDS1-SAG101 heterodimer and a derived EDS1-PAD4 structural model shows that EDS1 signals within mutually exclusive heterocomplexes. Although there is evolutionary conservation of α/β hydrolase topology in all three proteins, a noncatalytic resistance mechanism is indicated. Instead, the respective N-terminal domains appear to facilitate binding of the essential EP domains to create novel interaction surfaces on the heterodimer. Transitions between distinct functional EDS1 heterodimers might explain the central importance and versatility of this regulatory node in plant immunity.

Abstract: The loss of oligodendroglia and demyelination contributes to the lack of functional recovery after spinal cord injury. The transplantation of adult neural progenitor cells (NPCs) might be a promising strategy to replace oligodendroglia lost after injury, however only a very small proportion of grafted NPCs differentiate into oligodendroglia. The present study aimed to investigate whether co-transplantation of subventricular zone-derived NPCs with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) will enhance oligodendroglial differentiation of NPCs. In vitro, oligodendroglial differentiation was strongly enhanced by co-cultivation of NPCs with BMSCs or BMSC-conditioned medium. For in vivo experiments, adult Fischer 344 rats underwent cervical dorsal funiculus transections, immediately followed by grafting of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) pre-labeled syngeneic NPCs mixed with BMSCs isolated from adult bone marrow. Six weeks post-injury and grafting, BMSC-containing grafts filled the lesion cavity but did not enhance oligodendroglial differentiation of co-grafted NPCs. The failure of BMSCs to induce oligodendroglial differentiation in vivo coincided with a rapid upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein 2/4 (BMP2/4) around the injury site and in vitro data demonstrated that BMP2/4 can override the oligodendrogenic effects of BMSCs. Moreover, blocking BMP activity can rescue the effect of BMSCs on NPCs. Thus, neutralization of BMP or BMP signaling might be required to allow for BMSC-induced oligodendroglial differentiation of grafted NPCs in the injured spinal cord.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomal integrity has been known for many years to affect the ability of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to contribute to the germline of chimeric mice. Abnormal chromosomes are generally detected by standard cytogenetic karyotyping. However, this method is expensive, time consuming, and often omitted prior to blastocyst injection, consequently reducing the frequency of mESC-derived offspring. Here, we show a fast, accurate, and inexpensive screen for identifying the two most common aneuploidies (Trisomy 8 and loss of chromosome Y) in genetically manipulated mESCs using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Screening against these two aneuploidies significantly increases the fraction of normal mESC clones. Our method is extremely sensitive and can detect as low as 10% aneuploidy among a large population of mESCs. It greatly expedites the generation of mutant mice and provides a quick tool for assessing the aneuploidy percentages of any mESC line.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear bodies (NBs), characterized by the presence of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, are important components of the nuclear architecture, contributing to genetic and epigenetic control of gene expression. In investigating the mechanisms mediating HIV-1 latency, we determined that silenced but transcriptionally competent HIV-1 proviruses reside in close proximity to PML NBs and that this association inhibits HIV-1 gene expression. PML binds to the latent HIV-1 promoter, which coincides with transcriptionally inactive facultative heterochromatic marks, notably H3K9me2, at the viral genome. PML degradation and NB disruption result in strong activation of viral transcription as well as release of G9a, the major methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me2, and loss of facultative heterochromatin marks from the proviral DNA. Additionally, HIV-1 transcriptional activation requires proviral displacement from PML NBs by active nuclear actin polymerization. Thus, nuclear topology and active gene movement mediate HIV-1 transcriptional regulation and have implications for controlling HIV-1 latency and eradication.

Abstract: Summary
The bacteria causing Legionnaires’ disease, Legionella pneumophila, replicate intracellularly within unique Legionella-containing vacuoles (LCVs). LCV formation involves a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that translocates effector proteins into host cells. We show that the T4SS effector RidL localizes to LCVs, supports intracellular bacterial growth, and alters retrograde trafficking, in which selected proteins are transported from endosomes to the Golgi. The retromer complex that mediates retrograde trafficking localizes to LCVs independently of RidL and restricts intracellular bacterial growth. RidL binds the Vps29 retromer subunit and the lipid PtdIns(3)P, which localizes retromer components to membranes. Additionally, specific retromer cargo receptors and sorting nexins that mediate protein capture and membrane remodeling preferentially localize to LCVs in the absence of ridL. Ectopic RidL production inhibits retrograde trafficking, and L. pneumophila blocks retrograde transport at endosome exit sites in a ridL-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings suggest that RidL inhibits retromer function to promote intracellular bacterial replication.

Abstract: Despite improved treatment options, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains the most aggressive brain tumour with the shortest post-diagnostic survival. Arsenite (As2O3) is already being used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), yet its effects on GBM have not been evaluated in detail. In U87MG cell monolayers, we have previously shown that arsenite cytotoxicity significantly increases upon transient inhibition of lysosomal protease Cathepsin L (CatL). As multicellular spheroids more closely represent in vivo tumours, we aimed to evaluate the impact of permanent CatL silencing on arsenite treatment in U87MG spheroids. CatL was stably silenced using shRNA expression plasmid packed lentiviruses. By using metabolic- and cell viability assays, we demonstrated that long-term CatL silencing significantly increased arsenite cytotoxicity in U87MG spheroids. Silenced CatL also increased arsenite-mediated apoptosis in spheroids via elevated p53 expression, Bax/Bcl2 ratio and caspase 3/7 activity, though with lower efficacy than in monolayers. Arsenite cytotoxicity was enhanced by lower CatL activity, since similar cytotoxicity increase was also observed using the novel CatL inhibitor AT094. The results have significant translational impact, since stable CatL silencing would enable the application of lower systemic doses of arsenite to achieve the desired cytotoxic effects on GBMs in vivo.

Abstract: The outcomes of clinical trials using bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) are variable; the degree of the expansion of BMSCs during clinical manufacturing may contribute to this variability since cell expansion is limited by senescence. Human BMSCs from aspirates of healthy subjects were subcultured serially until cell growth stopped. Phenotype and functional measurements of BMSCs from two subjects including senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and colony formation efficiency changed from an early to a senescence pattern at passage 6 or 7. Transcriptome analysis of 10 early and 15 late passage BMSC samples from 5 subjects revealed 2122 differentially expressed genes, which were associated with immune response, development, and cell proliferation pathways. Analysis of 57 serial BMSC samples from 7 donors revealed that the change from an early to senescent profile was variable among subjects and occurred prior to changes in phenotypes. BMSC age expressed as a percentage of maximum population doublings (PDs) was a good indicator for an early or senescence transcription signature but this measure of BMSC life span can only be calculated after expanding BMSCs to senescence. In order to find a more useful surrogate measure of BMSC age, we used a computational biology approach to identify a set of genes whose expression at each passage would predict elapsed age of BMSCs. A total of 155 genes were highly correlated with BMSC age. A least angle regression algorithm identified a set of 24 BMSC age-predictive genes. In conclusion, the onset of senescence-associated molecular changes was variable and preceded changes in other indicators of BMSC quality and senescence. The 24 BMSC age predictive genes will be useful in assessing the quality of clinical BMSC products.

Abstract: Summary
Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which conventionally are isolated based on their adherence to plastic, are heterogeneous and have poor growth and differentiation, limiting our ability to investigate their intrinsic characteristics. We report an improved prospective clonal isolation technique and reveal that the combination of three cell-surface markers (LNGFR, THY-1, and VCAM-1) allows for the selection of highly enriched clonogenic cells (one out of three isolated cells). Clonal characterization of LNGFR+THY-1+ cells demonstrated cellular heterogeneity among the clones. Rapidly expanding clones (RECs) exhibited robust multilineage differentiation and self-renewal potency, whereas the other clones tended to acquire cellular senescence via P16INK4a and exhibited frequent genomic errors. Furthermore, RECs exhibited unique expression of VCAM-1 and higher cellular motility compared with the other clones. The combination marker LNGFR+THY-1+VCAM-1hi+ (LTV) can be used selectively to isolate the most potent and genetically stable MSCs.

Abstract: Diet is highly linked to breast cancer risk, yet little is known about its influence on mammary epithelial populations with distinct regenerative and hence, tumorigenic potential. To investigate this, we evaluated the relative frequency of lineage-negative CD29hiCD24+, CD29loCD24+ and CD29hiThy1+CD24+ epithelial subpopulations in pre-neoplastic mammary tissue of adult virgin MMTV-Wnt1-transgenic mice fed either control (Casein) or soy-based diets. We found that mammary epithelial cells exposed to soy diet exhibited a lower percentage of CD29hiCD24+Lin− population, decreased ability to form mammospheres in culture, lower mammary outgrowth potential when transplanted into cleared fat pads, and reduced appearance of tumor-initiating CD29hiThy1+CD24+ cells, than in those of control diet-fed mice. Diet had no comparable influence on the percentage of the CD29loCD24+Lin− population. Global gene expression profiling of the CD29hiCD24+subpopulation revealed markedly altered expression of genes important to inflammation, cytokine and chemokine signaling, and proliferation. Soy-fed relative to casein-fed mice showed lower mammary tumor incidence, shorter tumor latency, and reduced systemic levels of estradiol 17-β, progesterone and interleukin-6. Our results provide evidence for the functional impact of diet on specific epithelial subpopulations that may relate to breast cancer risk and suggest that diet-regulated cues can be further explored for breast cancer risk assessment and prevention.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete paracrine factors that could be cytoprotective and serve roles in immunoregulation during tissue injury. Although MSCs express HIV receptors, and co-receptors, and are susceptible to HIV infection, whether HIV-1 may affect biological properties of MSCs needs more study. We evaluated cellular proliferation, differentiation and paracrine functions of MSCs isolated from compact bones of healthy control mice and Tg26 HIV-1 transgenic mice. The ability of MSCs to protect against cisplatin toxicity was studied in cultured renal tubular cells as well as in intact mice. We successfully isolated MSCs from healthy mice and Tg26 HIV-1 transgenic mice and found the latter expressed viral Nef, Vpu, NL4-3 and Vif genes. The proliferation and differentiation of Tg26 HIV-1 MSCs was inferior to MSCs from healthy mice. Moreover, transplantation of Tg26 HIV-1 MSCs less effectively improved outcomes compared with healthy MSCs in mice with acute kidney injury. Also, Tg26 HIV-1 MSCs secreted multiple cytokines, but at significantly lower levels than healthy MSCs, which resulted in failure of conditioned medium from these MSCs to protect cultured renal tubular cells from cisplatin toxicity. Therefore, HIV-1 had adverse biological effects on MSCs extending to their proliferation, differentiation, function, and therapeutic potential. These findings will help in advancing mechanistical insight in renal injury and repair in the setting of HIV-1 infection.

Abstract: Summary
Neisseria meningitidis is a life-threatening human bacterial pathogen responsible for pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Meningococcal strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin G (PenI) carry a mutated penicillin-binding protein (PBP2) resulting in a modified peptidoglycan structure. Despite their antibiotic resistance, PenI strains have failed to expand clonally. We analyzed the biological consequences of PBP2 alteration among clinical meningococcal strains and found that peptidoglycan modifications of the PenI strain resulted in diminished in vitro Nod1-dependent proinflammatory activity. In an influenza virus-meningococcal sequential mouse model mimicking human disease, wild-type meningococci induced a Nod1-dependent inflammatory response, colonizing the lungs and surviving in the blood. In contrast, isogenic PenI strains were attenuated for such response and were out-competed by meningococci sensitive to penicillin G. Our results suggest that antibiotic resistance imposes a cost to the success of the pathogen and may potentially explain the lack of clonal expansion of PenI strains.

Abstract: This is the first study that comprehensively describes the effects of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms C and D during in vitro expansion of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Our results show that PDGFs can enhance proliferation of hMSCs without affecting their multipotency. It is of great value to culture and expand hMSCs in a safe and effective manner without losing their multipotency for manipulation and further development of cell-based therapies. Moreover, differential effects of PDGF isoforms have been observed on lineage-specific differentiation induced by BMP2 and Vitamin D3. Based on label-free LC-based quantitative proteomics approach we have furthermore identified specific pathways induced by PDGFs during the proliferation process, showing the importance of bioinformatics tools to study cell function.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly resistant to conventional systemic therapies and prognosis for advanced HCC patients remains poor. Recent studies of the molecular mechanisms responsible for tumor initiation and progression have identified several potential molecular targets in HCC. Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor shown to have survival benefits in advanced HCC. It acts by inhibiting the serine/threonine kinases and the receptor type tyrosine kinases. In preclinical experiments sorafenib had anti-proliferative activity in hepatoma cells and it reduced tumor angiogenesis and increased apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the cytotoxic mechanisms of sorafenib include its inhibitory effects on protein ubiquitination, unfolded protein response (UPR) and keratin phosphorylation in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Moreover, we show that combined treatment with sorafenib and proteasome inhibitors (PIs) synergistically induced a marked increase in cell death in hepatoma- and hepatocyte-derived cells. These observations may open the way to potentially interesting treatment combinations that may augment the effect of sorafenib, possibly including drugs that promote ER stress. Because sorafenib blocked the cellular defense mechanisms against hepatotoxic injury not only in hepatoma cells but also in hepatocyte-derived cells, we must be careful to avoid severe liver injury.

Abstract: As a new potential inflammatory mediator, visfatin plays an important role in inflammation and atherosclerosis. The formation of macrophage-derived foam cells occurs at the early stage of atherosclerosis and underlies the visible fatty streak. Recent studies have indicated that visfatin may be associated with the development of foam cells, but its exact effect and molecular mechanism remain unknown. This study aims to study the effect of visfatin on foamy cell formation and its underlying molecular mechanism. Visfatin levels were determined in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout (KO) mice on a western diet for 16 weeks. Effects of visfatin in cholesterol accumulation were studied both in vivo and in vitro. The levels of scavenger receptors located in macrophage surface were measured in RAW264.7 cells after treatment with visfatin. Visfatin levels were much higher in ApoE KO mice than that in the control mice. Meanwhile, oxidized low-density lipoprotein induces both visfatin release from RAW264.7 cells and its cellular levels within 24 h. Visfatin promotes lipid accumulation mainly through excessive cholesterol uptake not only in RAW264.7 cells but also in peritoneal macrophages isolated from ApoE KO mice. Furthermore, visfatin induces the activation of scavenger receptors (SR)-A and cluster of differentiation (CD)36, but not that of SR-BI, ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC)A1, or ABCG1 in RAW264.7 cells. Both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation may work in concert to mediate the expression of SR-A and CD36 in visfatin-treated cells. Visfatin induces cholesterol accumulation in macrophages and accelerates the process of atherosclerosis mainly through modulating the expression of SR-A and CD36.

Abstract: Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate-1 (STEAP-1) is a novel cell surface protein overexpressed only in the prostate among normal tissues and various types of cancer including prostate, bladder, lung, and ovarian cancer. Although its function in prostate and tumor cells has been remained unclear, due to its unique and restricted expression, STEAP-1 is expected to be an attractive target for cancer therapy. Here, we show that knockdown of STEAP-1 in human cancer cells caused the retardation of tumor growth compared with wild type in vivo. In contrast, STEAP-1 introduced tumor cells augmented the tumor growth compared with STEAP-1-negative wild type cells. Using dye transfer assay, we demonstrate that the STEAP-1 is involved in intercellular communication between tumor cells and adjacent tumor stromal cells and therefore may play a key role for the tumor growth in vivo. These data indicate the inhibition of the STEAP-1 function or expression can be a new strategy for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Extracellular protein misfolding is implicated in many age-related diseases including Alzheimer's disease, macular degeneration and arthritis. In this study, putative endogenous clients for the chaperone activity of α2-macroglobulin (α2M) were identified after human plasma was subjected to physiologically relevant sheer stress at 37°C for 10 days. Western blot analysis showed that four major acute phase proteins: ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, α1-acid glycoprotein and complement component 3, preferentially co-purified with α2M after plasma was stressed. Furthermore, the formation of complexes between α2M and these putative chaperone clients, detected by sandwich ELISA, was shown to be enhanced in response to stress. These results support the hypothesis that α2M plays an important role in extracellular proteostasis by sequestering misfolded proteins and targeting them for disposal, particularly during acute phase reactions.

Abstract: Parental imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon by which genes are expressed in a monoallelic fashion, according to their parent of origin. DNA methylation is considered the hallmark mechanism regulating parental imprinting. To identify imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we compared the DNA methylation status between multiple normal and parthenogenetic human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) by performing reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Our analysis identified over 20 previously unknown imprinted DMRs in addition to the known DMRs. These include DMRs in loci associated with human disorders, and a class of intergenic DMRs that do not seem to be related to gene expression. Furthermore, the study showed some DMRs to be unstable, liable to differentiation or reprogramming. A comprehensive comparison between mouse and human DMRs identified almost half of the imprinted DMRs to be species specific. Taken together, our data map novel DMRs in the human genome, their evolutionary conservation, and relation to gene expression.

Abstract: Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the self-renewal and differentiation of dental epithelial stem cells (DESCs) that support the unlimited growth potential of mouse incisors is critical for developing novel tooth regenerative therapies and unraveling the pathogenesis of odontogenic tumors. However, analysis of DESC properties and regulation has been limited by the lack of an in vitro assay system and well-documented DESC markers. Here, we describe an in vitro sphere culture system to isolate the DESCs from postnatal mouse incisor cervical loops (CLs) where the DESCs are thought to reside. The dissociated cells from CLs were able to expand and form spheres for multiple generations in the culture system. Lineage tracing indicated that DESC within the spheres were epithelial in origin as evident by lineage tracing. Upon stimulation, the sphere cells differentiated into cytokeratin 14- and amelogenin-expressing and mineral material-producing cells. Compared to the CL tissue, sphere cells expressed high levels of expression of Sca-1, CD49f (also designated as integrin α6), and CD44. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses of mouse incisor CL cells further showed that the CD49fBright population was enriched in sphere-forming cells. In addition, the CD49fBright population includes both slow-cycling and Lgr5+ DESCs. The in vitro sphere culture system and identification of CD49fBright as a DESC marker provide a novel platform for enriching DESCs, interrogating how maintenance, cell fate determination, and differentiation of DESCs are regulated, and developing tooth regenerative therapies.

Abstract: In polarized, migrating cells, stress fibers are a highly dynamic network of contractile acto-myosin structures composed of bundles of actin filaments held together by actin cross-linking proteins such as α-actinins. As such, α-actinins influence actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics and focal adhesion maturation. In response to environmental signals, α-actinins are tyrosine phosphorylated and this affects their binding to actin stress fibers; however, the cellular role of α-actinin tyrosine phosphorylation remains largely unknown. We found that non-muscle α-actinin1/4 are critical for the establishment of dorsal stress fibers and maintenance of transverse arc stress fibers. Analysis of cells genetically depleted of α-actinin1 and 4 reveals two distinct modes for focal adhesion maturation. An α-actinin1 or 4 dependent mode that uses dorsal stress fiber precursors as a template for establishing focal adhesions and their maturation, and an α-actinin-independent manner that uses transverse arc precursors to establish focal adhesions at both ends. Focal adhesions formed in the absence of α-actinins are delayed in their maturation, exhibit altered morphology, have decreased amounts of Zyxin and VASP, and reduced adhesiveness to extracellular matrix. Further rescue experiments demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylation of α-actinin1 at Y12 and α-actinin4 at Y265 is critical for dorsal stress fiber establishment, transverse arc maintenance and focal adhesion maturation.

Abstract: Pluripotency is maintained by both known and unknown transcriptional regulatory networks. In the present study, we have identified Zfp819, a KRAB-zinc finger protein, as a novel pluripotency-related factor and characterized its role in pluripotent stem cells. We show that Zfp819 is expressed highly in various types of pluripotent stem cells but not in their differentiated counterparts. We identified the presence of non-canonical nuclear localization signals in particular zinc finger motifs and identified them as responsible for the nuclear localization of Zfp819. Analysis of the Zfp819 promoter region revealed the presence of a transcriptionally active chromatin signature. Moreover, we confirmed the binding of pluripotency-related factors, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog to the distal promoter region of Zfp819, indicating that the expression of this gene is regulated by a pluripotency transcription factor network. We found that the expression of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) such as Intracisternal A Particle (IAP) retrotransposons, Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINE1), and Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINE B1) is significantly upregulated in Zfp819-knockdown (Zfp819_KD) cells. In line with the activation of ERVs, we observed the occurrence of spontaneous DNA damage in Zfp819_KD cells. Furthermore, we tested whether Zfp819 can interact with KAP1, a KRAB-associated protein with a transcriptional repression function, and found the interaction between these two proteins in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. The challenging of Zfp819_KD cells with DNA damaging agent revealed that these cells are inefficient in repairing the damaged DNA, as cells showed presence of γH2A.X foci for a prolonged time. Collectively, our study identified Zfp819 as a novel pluripotency-related factor and unveiled its function in genomic integrity maintenance mechanisms of mouse embryonic stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Placental malaria (PM) is a major cause of fetal growth restriction, yet the underlying mechanism is unclear. Complement C5a and C5a receptor levels are increased with PM. C5a is implicated in fetal growth restriction in non-infection-based animal models. In a case-control study of 492 pregnant Malawian women, we find that elevated C5a levels are associated with an increased risk of delivering a small-for-gestational-age infant. C5a was significantly increased in PM and was negatively correlated with the angiogenic factor angiopoietin-1 and positively correlated with angiopoietin-2, soluble endoglin, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of C5a or its receptor in a mouse model of PM resulted in greater fetoplacental vessel development, reduced placental vascular resistance, and improved fetal growth and survival. These data suggest that C5a drives fetal growth restriction in PM through dysregulation of angiogenic factors essential for placental vascular remodeling resulting in placental vascular insufficiency.

Abstract: Purpose
Pterygium is a fibrovascular growth on the ocular surface with corneal tissue destruction, matrix degradation and varying extents of chronic inflammation. To facilitate investigation of pterygium etiology, we immortalized pterygium fibroblast cells and profiled their global transcript levels compared to primary cultured cells.
Methods
Fibroblast cells were cultured from surgically excised pterygium tissue using the explant method and propagated to passage number 2–4. We hypothesized that intervention with 3 critical molecular intermediates may be necessary to propage these cells. Primary fibroblast cells were immortalized sequentially by a retroviral construct containing the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene and another retroviral expression vector expressing p53/p16 shRNAs. Primary and immortalized fibroblast cells were evaluated for differences in global gene transcript levels using an Agilent Genechip microarray.
Results
Light microscopic morphology of immortalized cells was similar to primary pterygium fibroblast at passage 2–4. Telomerase reverse transcriptase was expressed, and p53 and p16 levels were reduced in immortalized pterygium fibroblast cells. There were 3308 significantly dysregulated genes showing at least 2 fold changes in transcript levels between immortalized and primary cultured cells (2005 genes were up-regulated and 1303 genes were down-regulated). Overall, 13.58% (95% CI: 13.08–14.10) of transcripts in immortalized cells were differentially expressed by at least 2 folds compared to primary cells.
Conclusion
Pterygium primary fibroblast cells were successfully immortalized to at least passage 11. Although a variety of genes are differentially expressed between immortalized and primary cells, only genes related to cell cycle are significantly changed, suggesting that the immortalized cells may be used as an in vitro model for pterygium pathology.

Abstract: The hallmark of fibrosis is an accumulation of fibrillar collagens, especially of collagen type I. There is considerable debate whether in vivo type II epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in organ fibrosis. Lineage tracing experiments by various groups show opposing data concerning the relative contribution of epithelial cells to the pool of myofibroblasts. We hypothesized that EMT-derived cells might directly contribute to collagen deposition. To study this, EMT was induced in human epithelial lung and renal cell lines in vitro by means of TGF-β1 stimulation, and we compared the collagen type I (COL1A1) expression levels of transdifferentiated cells with that of myofibroblasts obtained by TGF-β1 stimulation of human dermal and lung fibroblasts. COL1A1 expression levels of transdifferentiated epithelial cells appeared to be at least one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of myofibroblasts. This was confirmed at immunohistochemical level: in contrast to myofibroblasts, collagen type I deposition by EMT-derived cells was not or hardly detectable. We postulate that, even when type II EMT occurs in vivo, the direct contribution of EMT-derived cells to collagen accumulation is rather limited.

Abstract: Mammalian genomes are replicated under a flexible program, with random use of origins and variable fork rates, and many details of the process must be still unraveled. Molecular combing provides a set of direct data regarding the replication profile of eukaryotic cells: fork rates; organization of the replication clusters; proportion of unidirectional forks; and fork dynamics. In this study the replication profiles of different primary and immortalized non-cancer human cells (lymphocytes, lymphoblastoid cells, fibroblasts) were evaluated at the whole-genome level or within reference genomic regions harboring coding genes. It emerged that these different cell types are characterized by specific replication profiles. In primary fibroblasts, a remarkable fraction of the mammalian genome was found to be replicated by unidirectional forks, and interestingly, the proportion of unidirectional forks further increased in the replicating genome along the population divisions. A second difference concerned in the proportion of paused replication forks, again more frequent in primary fibroblasts than in PBL/lymphoblastoid cells. We concluded that these patterns, whose relevance could escape when genomic methods are applied, represent normal replication features. In single-locus analyses, unidirectional and paused replication forks were highly represented in all genomic regions considered with respect to the average estimates referring to the whole-genome. In addition, fork rates were significantly lower than whole-genome estimates. Instead, when considering the specificities of each genomic region investigated (early to late replication, normal or fragile site) no further differentiating features of replication profiles were detected. These data, representing the integration of genome-wide and single-locus analyses, highlight a large heterogeneity of replication profiles among cell types and within the genome, which should be considered for the correct use of replication datasets.

Abstract: Cardiac remodeling resulting from impairment of myocardial integrity leads to heart failure, through still incompletely understood mechanisms. The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) system has been implicated in tissue maintenance, but its role in the adult heart is not well defined. We hypothesized that the FGF system plays a role in the maintenance of cardiac homeostasis, and the impairment of cardiomyocyte FGF signaling leads to pathological cardiac remodeling. We showed that FGF signaling is required for connexin 43 (Cx43) localization at cell–cell contacts in isolated cardiomyocytes and COS7 cells. Lack of FGF signaling led to decreased Cx43 phosphorylation at serines 325/328/330 (S325/328/330), sites known to be important for assembly of gap junctions. Cx43 instability induced by FGF inhibition was restored by the Cx43 S325/328/330 phospho-mimetic mutant, suggesting FGF-dependent phosphorylation of these sites. Consistent with these in vitro findings, cardiomyocyte-specific inhibition of FGF signaling in adult mice demonstrated mislocalization of Cx43 at intercalated discs, whereas localization of N-cadherin and desmoplakin was not affected. This led to premature death resulting from impaired cardiac remodeling. We conclude that cardiomyocyte FGF signaling is essential for cardiomyocyte homeostasis through phosphorylation of Cx43 at S325/328/330 residues which are important for the maintenance of gap junction.
