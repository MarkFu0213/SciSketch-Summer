Abstract: Caveolin-1 (CAV1) has been identified to be up-regulated in many cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, its potential function is still unclear in ccRCC. In this study, we demonstrated that CAV1 was frequently overexpressed in renal cell carcinoma tissues and cells, and was significantly associated with various clinicopathological parameters. In addition, high CAV1 expression was associated with poor disease-free survival (DFS) rate and could serve as a useful diagnostic indicator in ccRCC patients with different clinicopathological stages. Functional experiments demonstrated that CAV1 knockdown inhibited cell migration and invasion, whereas overexpression of CAV1 promoted cell migration and invasion in ccRCC. Moreover, CAV1 expression was up-regulated in sunitinib-resistant renal cancer cell lines, and its overexpression promoted sunitinib resistance. In general, our results confirm that CAV1 plays an important role in the metastasis of kidney cancer and induces sunitinib resistance, so CAV1 function suppression may become a promising clinical treatment strategy during renal cell carcinoma metastasis and sunitinib resistance.

Abstract: Progress in cell therapy for retinal disorders has been challenging. Recognized retinal progenitors are a heterogeneous population of cells that lack surface markers for the isolation of live cells for clinical implementation. In the present application, our objective was to use the stem cell factor receptor c-Kit (CD117), a surface marker, to isolate and evaluate a distinct progenitor cell population from retinas of postnatal and adult mice. Here we report that, by combining traditional methods with fate mapping, we have identified a c-Kit-positive (c-Kit+) retinal progenitor cell (RPC) that is self-renewing and clonogenic in vitro, and capable of generating many cell types in vitro and in vivo. Based on cell lineage tracing, significant subpopulations of photoreceptors in the outer nuclear layer and bipolar, horizontal, amacrine and Müller cells in the inner nuclear layer are the progeny of c-Kit+ cells in vivo. The RPC progeny contributes to retinal neurons and glial cells, which are responsible for the conversion of light into visual signals. The ability to isolate and expand in vitro live c-Kit+ RPCs makes them a future therapeutic option for retinal diseases.

Abstract: Exercise stimulates immune responses, but the appropriate “doses” for such achievements are unsettled. Conversely, in metabolic tissues, exercise improves the heat shock (HS) response, a universal cytoprotective response to proteostasis challenges that are centred on the expression of the 70-kDa family of intracellular heat shock proteins (iHSP70), which are anti-inflammatory. Concurrently, exercise triggers the export of HSP70 towards the extracellular milieu (eHSP70), where they work as pro-inflammatory cytokines. As the HS response is severely compromised in chronic degenerative diseases of inflammatory nature, we wondered whether acute exercise bouts of different intensities could alter the HS response of lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs and whether this would be related to immunoinflammatory responses. Adult male Wistar rats swam for 20 min at low, moderate, high or strenuous intensities as per an overload in tail base. Controls remained at rest under the same conditions. Afterwards, mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes were assessed for the potency of the HS response (42°C for 2 h), NF-κB binding activity, mitogen-stimulated proliferation and cytokine production. Exercise stimulated cell proliferation in an “inverted-U” fashion peaking at moderate load, which was paralleled by suppression of NF-κB activation and nuclear location, and followed by enhanced HS response in relation to non-exercised animals. Comparative levels of eHSP70 to iHSP70 (H-index) matched IL-2/IL-10 ratios. We conclude that exercise, in a workload-dependent way, stimulates immunoinflammatory performance of lymphocytes of tissues far from the circulation and this is associated with H-index of stress response, which is useful to assess training status and immunosurveillance balance.

Abstract: Summary
Genome degradation correlates with host adaptation and systemic disease in Salmonella. Most lineages of the S. enterica subspecies Typhimurium cause gastroenteritis in humans; however, the recently emerged ST313 lineage II pathovar commonly causes systemic bacteremia in sub-Saharan Africa. ST313 lineage II displays genome degradation compared to gastroenteritis-associated lineages; yet, the mechanisms and causal genetic differences mediating these infection phenotypes are largely unknown. We find that the ST313 isolate D23580 hyperdisseminates from the gut to systemic sites, such as the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), via CD11b+ migratory dendritic cells (DCs). This hyperdissemination was facilitated by the loss of sseI, which encodes an effector that inhibits DC migration in gastroenteritis-associated isolates. Expressing functional SseI in D23580 reduced the number of infected migratory DCs and bacteria in the MLN. Our study reveals a mechanism linking pseudogenization of effectors with the evolution of niche adaptation in a bacterial pathogen.

Abstract: DMRT genes encode a deeply conserved family of transcription factors that share a unique DNA binding motif, the DM domain. DMRTs regulate development in a broad variety of metazoans and they appear to have controlled sexual differentiation for hundreds of millions of years. In mice, starting during embryonic development, three Dmrt genes act sequentially to help establish and maintain spermatogenesis. Dmrt1 has notably diverse functions that include repressing pluripotency genes and promoting mitotic arrest in embryonic germ cells, reactivating prospermatogonia perinatally, establishing and maintaining spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), promoting spermatogonial differentiation, and controlling the mitosis/meiosis switch. Dmrt6 acts in differentiating spermatogonia to coordinate an orderly exit from the mitotic/spermatogonial program and allow proper timing of entry to the meiotic/spermatocyte program. Finally, Dmrt7 takes over during the first meiotic prophase to help choreograph a transition in histone modifications that maintains transcriptional silencing of the sex chromosomes. The combined action of these three Dmrt genes helps ensure robust and sustainable spermatogenesis.

Abstract: Rabbit induced pluripotent stem cells (rbiPSCs) possess the characteristic features of primed pluripotency as defined in rodents and primates. In the present study, we reprogrammed rbiPSCs using human Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) 2 and 4 and cultured them in a medium supplemented with fetal calf serum and leukemia inhibitory factor. These cells (designated rbEKA) were propagated by enzymatic dissociation for at least 30 passages, during which they maintained a normal karyotype. This new culturing protocol resulted in transcriptional and epigenetic reconfiguration, as substantiated by the expression of transcription factors and the presence of histone modifications associated with naïve pluripotency. Furthermore, microarray analysis of rbiPSCs, rbEKA cells, rabbit ICM cells, and rabbit epiblast showed that the global gene expression profile of the reprogrammed rbiPSCs was more similar to that of rabbit ICM and epiblast cells. Injection of rbEKA cells into 8-cell stage rabbit embryos resulted in extensive colonization of ICM in 9% early-blastocysts (E3.5), epiblast in 10% mid-blastocysts (E4.5), and embryonic disk in 1.4% pre-gastrulae (E6). Thus, these results indicate that KLF2 and KLF4 triggered the conversion of rbiPSCs into epiblast-like, embryo colonization-competent PSCs. Our results highlight some of the requirements to achieve bona fide chimeric competency.

Abstract: Summary
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BM-MSCs) are key components of the hematopoietic niche thought to have a direct role in leukemia pathogenesis. BM-MSCs from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been poorly characterized due to disease heterogeneity. We report a functional, genetic, and immunological characterization of BM-MSC cultures from 46 AML patients, stratified by molecular/cytogenetics into low-risk (LR), intermediate-risk (IR), and high-risk (HR) subgroups. Stable MSC cultures were successfully established and characterized from 40 of 46 AML patients irrespective of the risk subgroup. AML-derived BM-MSCs never harbored tumor-specific cytogenetic/molecular alterations present in blasts, but displayed higher clonogenic potential than healthy donor (HD)-derived BM-MSCs. Although HD- and AML-derived BM-MSCs equally provided chemoprotection to AML cells in vitro, AML-derived BM-MSCs were more immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory, enhanced suppression of lymphocyte proliferation, and diminished secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Multivariate analysis revealed that the level of interleukin-10 produced by AML-derived BM-MSCs as an independent prognostic factor negatively affected overall survival. Collectively our data show that AML-derived BM-MSCs are not tumor related, but display functional differences contributing to therapy resistance and disease evolution.

Abstract: Summary
THAP1 (THAP [Thanatos-associated protein] domain-containing, apoptosis-associated protein 1) is a ubiquitously expressed member of a family of transcription factors with highly conserved DNA-binding and protein-interacting regions. Mutations in THAP1 cause dystonia, DYT6, a neurologic movement disorder. THAP1 downstream targets and the mechanism via which it causes dystonia are largely unknown. Here, we show that wild-type THAP1 regulates embryonic stem cell (ESC) potential, survival, and proliferation. Our findings identify THAP1 as an essential factor underlying mouse ESC survival and to some extent, differentiation, particularly neuroectodermal. Loss of THAP1 or replacement with a disease-causing mutation results in an enhanced rate of cell death, prolongs Nanog, Prdm14, and/or Rex1 expression upon differentiation, and results in failure to upregulate ectodermal genes. ChIP-Seq reveals that these activities are likely due in part to indirect regulation of gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (ESC-CMs) may offer significant advances in creating in vitro cardiac tissues for disease modeling, drug testing, and elucidating developmental processes; however, the induction of ESCs to a more adult-like CM phenotype remains challenging. In this study, we developed a bioreactor system to employ pulsatile flow (1.48 mL/min), cyclic strain (5%), and extended culture time to improve the maturation of murine and human ESC-CMs. Dynamically-cultured ESC-CMs showed an increased expression of cardiac-associated proteins and genes, cardiac ion channel genes, as well as increased SERCA activity and a Raman fingerprint with the presence of maturation-associated peaks similar to primary CMs. We present a bioreactor platform that can serve as a foundation for the development of human-based cardiac in vitro models to verify drug candidates, and facilitates the study of cardiovascular development and disease.

Abstract: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare hereditary disorder which is caused by ABCC6 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 6) gene mutations. Characteristic hallmarks of PXE are progressive calcification and degradation of the elastic fibers in skin, cardiovascular system and ocular fundus. Since the underlying pathomechanisms of PXE remain unidentified, the aim of this study was to get new insights into PXE pathophysiology by characterizing dermal myofibroblast differentiation. Fibroblasts are the key cells of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and, therefore, participate not only in physiological processes, such as calcification or wound healing, but also in pathologic events, such as fibrotization. We revealed that human dermal PXE fibroblasts possess exaggerated migration capability in wound healing and attenuated myofibroblast contractility in comparison to controls. Subsequent analyses reinforced these observations and indicated a diminished induction of the myofibroblast differentiation markers α-smooth muscle actin and xylosyltransferase-I as well as poor transforming growth factor-β1 responsiveness in PXE fibroblasts. In summary, we describe pathological deviations of dermal myofibroblast differentiation in PXE which might be mediated by aberrant supramolecular ECM organization. These results not only improve our insights into cellular PXE pathophysiology, but might also qualify us to interfere with ECM remodeling in the future.

Abstract: The mammalian stress protein Hsp105α protects cells from stress conditions. Several studies have indicated that Hsp105α is overexpressed in many types of solid tumors, which contain hypoxic microenvironments. However, the role of Hsp105α in hypoxic tumors remains largely unknown. We herein demonstrated the involvement of Hsp105α in HIF-1 functions induced by the hypoxia-mimetic agent CoCl2. While Hsp105α is mainly localized in the cytoplasm under normal conditions, a treatment with CoCl2 induces the nuclear localization of Hsp105α, which correlated with HIF-1α expression levels. The overexpression of degradation-resistant HIF-1α enhances the nuclear localization of Hsp105α without the CoCl2 treatment. The CoCl2-dependent transcriptional activation of HIF-1, which is measured using a reporter gene containing a HIF-responsive element, is reduced by the knockdown of Hsp105α. Furthermore, the CoCl2-induced accumulation of HIF-1α is enhanced by heat shock, which results in the nuclear localization of Hsp105, and is suppressed by the knockdown of Hsp105. Hsp105 associates with HIF-1α in CoCl2-treated cells. These results suggest that Hsp105α plays an important role in the functions of HIF-1 under hypoxic conditions, in which Hsp105α enhances the accumulation and transcriptional activity of HIF-1 through the HIF-1α-mediated nuclear localization of Hsp105α.

Abstract: SG2NA belongs to a three-member striatin subfamily of WD40 repeat superfamily of proteins. It has multiple protein-protein interaction domains involved in assembling supramolecular signaling complexes. Earlier, we had demonstrated that there are at least five variants of SG2NA generated by alternative splicing, intron retention, and RNA editing. Such versatile and dynamic mode of regulation implicates it in tissue development. In order to shed light on its role in cell physiology, total proteome analysis was performed in NIH3T3 cells depleted of 78 kDa SG2NA, the only isoform expressing therein. A number of ER stress markers were among those modulated after knockdown of SG2NA. In cells treated with the ER stressors thapsigargin and tunicamycin, expression of SG2NA was increased at both mRNA and protein levels. The increased level of SG2NA was primarily in the mitochondria and the microsomes. A mouse injected with thapsigargin also had an increase in SG2NA in the liver but not in the brain. Cell cycle analysis suggested that while loss of SG2NA reduces the level of cyclin D1 and retains a population of cells in the G1 phase, concurrent ER stress facilitates their exit from G1 and traverse through subsequent phases with concomitant cell death. Thus, SG2NA is a component of intrinsic regulatory pathways that maintains ER homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Astroglial cells isolated from the rodent postnatal cerebral cortex are particularly susceptible to lineage reprogramming into neurons. However, it remains unknown whether other astroglial populations retain the same potential. Likewise, little is known about the fate of induced neurons (iNs) in vivo. In this study we addressed these questions using two different astroglial populations isolated from the postnatal brain reprogrammed either with Neurogenin-2 (Neurog2) or Achaete scute homolog-1 (Ascl1). We show that cerebellum (CerebAstro) and cerebral cortex astroglia (CtxAstro) generates iNs with distinctive neurochemical and morphological properties. Both astroglial populations contribute iNs to the olfactory bulb following transplantation in the postnatal and adult mouse subventricular zone. However, only CtxAstro transfected with Neurog2 differentiate into pyramidal-like iNs after transplantation in the postnatal cerebral cortex. Altogether, our data indicate that the origin of the astroglial population and transcription factors used for reprogramming, as well as the region of integration, affect the fate of iNs.

Abstract: Cited2 plays crucial roles in mouse embryonic stem cells self-renewal, the initiation of the somatic reprogramming process into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and the suppression of cell senescence. Here, we investigated the potential of CITED2 expression in combination with the Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc factors for reprogramming of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) at passage 2 and 4. The ectopic CITED2 expression in primary MEF prior to the onset of the reprogramming process, generated iPSC with less variability in the expression of endogenous pluripotency-related genes. In contrast, part of the MEF reprogrammed without ectopic expression of CITED2 at passage 4 originated partially reprogrammed iPSC or pre-iPSC. However, the overexpression of CITED2 in the pre-iPSC was insufficient to complete the reprogramming process into iPSC. These results indicated that ectopic CITED2 expression at the onset of the reprogramming process in combination with the reprogramming factors promotes a complete and homogeneous conversion of somatic cells into iPSC.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells were created from a pancreas agenesis patient with a mutation in GATA6. Using genome-editing technology, additional stem cell lines with mutations in both GATA6 alleles were generated and demonstrated a severe block in definitive endoderm induction, which could be rescued by re-expression of several different GATA family members. Using the endodermal progenitor stem cell culture system to bypass the developmental block at the endoderm stage, cell lines with mutations in one or both GATA6 alleles could be differentiated into β-like cells but with reduced efficiency. Use of suboptimal doses of retinoic acid during pancreas specification revealed a more severe phenotype, more closely mimicking the patient’s disease. GATA6 mutant β-like cells fail to secrete insulin upon glucose stimulation and demonstrate defective insulin processing. These data show that GATA6 plays a critical role in endoderm and pancreas specification and β-like cell functionality in humans.

Abstract: Immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory macrophage (Mφ), M2-Mφ that expressed the typical M2-Mφs marker, CD206, and anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-10, is beneficial and expected tool for the cytotherapy against inflammatory diseases. Here, we demonstrated that bone marrow-derived lineage-positive (Lin+) blood cells proliferated and differentiated into M2-Mφs by cooperation with the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under hypoxic condition: MSCs not only promoted proliferation of undifferentiated M2-Mφs, pre-M2-Mφs, in the Lin+ fraction via a proliferative effect of the MSCs-secreted macrophage colony-stimulating factor, but also promoted M2-Mφ polarization of the pre-M2-Mφs through cell-to-cell contact with the pre-M2-Mφs. Intriguingly, an inhibitor for intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 receptor/lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1, Rwj50271, partially suppressed expression of CD206 in the Lin+ blood cells but an inhibitor for VCAM-1 receptor/VLA-4, BIO5192, did not, suggesting that the cell-to-cell adhesion through LFA-1 on pre-M2-Mφs and ICAM-1 on MSCs was supposed to promoted the M2-Mφ polarization. Thus, the co-culture system consisting of bone marrow-derived Lin+ blood cells and MSCs under hypoxic condition was a beneficial supplier of a number of M2-Mφs, which could be clinically applicable to inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Macrophages and mast cells are usually present in the tumor microenvironment and play an important role as regulators of inflammation, immunological response and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we have evaluated macrophage, mast cell, and microvessel density in a selected group of different grade of invasive breast carcinoma tumor specimens. Furthermore, we have investigated the pattern of distribution of CD68-positive macrophages and tryptase-positive mast cells around tumor glands. Results have shown that: A) Macrophages are more numerous in G2 and G3 breast cancer stages respect to controls, the per cent of macrophages in G1 samples was comparable to the controls, and the spatial relationship between macrophages and glands (as indicated by the mean cell-to-gland distance) correlated with CD31-positive vessels. B) Mast cells in G2 and G3 tumor specimens show a significant increase in their number as compared to control samples, and their spatial distribution around the glands did not show any significant difference among groups. Overall, the results of this study confirm the important role of macrophages and mast cells in tumor progression and angiogenesis in human ductal breast cancer, and pointed out the spatial relationship between tumor macrophages and glands, and its correlation with microvascular density.

Abstract: The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiation to cells composing major organs has opened up the possibility for a new model system to study adverse toxicities associated with chemotherapy. Therefore, we used human iPSC-derived neurons to study peripheral neuropathy, one of the most common adverse effects of chemotherapy and cause for dose reduction. To determine the utility of these neurons in investigating the effects of neurotoxic chemotherapy, we measured morphological differences in neurite outgrowth, cell viability as determined by ATP levels and apoptosis through measures of caspase 3/7 activation following treatment with clinically relevant concentrations of platinating agents (cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin), taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel), a targeted proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib), an antiangiogenic compound (thalidomide), and 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapeutic that does not cause neuropathy. We demonstrate differential sensitivity of neurons to mechanistically distinct classes of chemotherapeutics. We also show a dose-dependent reduction of electrical activity as measured by mean firing rate of the neurons following treatment with paclitaxel. We compared neurite outgrowth and cell viability of iPSC-derived cortical (iCell® Neurons) and peripheral (Peri.4U) neurons to cisplatin, paclitaxel and vincristine. Goshajinkigan, a Japanese herbal neuroprotectant medicine, was protective against paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity but not oxaliplatin as measured by morphological phenotypes. Thus, we have demonstrated the utility of human iPSC-derived neurons as a useful model to distinguish drug class differences and for studies of a potential neuroprotectant for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

Abstract: Black band disease (BBD) is a widespread coral pathology caused by a microbial consortium dominated by cyanobacteria, which is significantly contributing to the loss of coral cover and diversity worldwide. Since the effects of the BBD pathogens on the physiology and cellular stress response of coral polyps appear almost unknown, the expression of some molecular biomarkers, such as Hsp70, Hsp60, HO-1, and MnSOD, was analyzed in the apparently healthy tissues of Goniopora columna located at different distances from the infection and during two disease development stages. All the biomarkers displayed different levels of expression between healthy and diseased colonies. In the healthy corals, low basal levels were found stable over time in different parts of the same colony. On the contrary, in the diseased colonies, a strong up-regulation of all the biomarkers was observed in all the tissues surrounding the infection, which suffered an oxidative stress probably generated by the alternation, at the progression front of the disease, of conditions of oxygen supersaturation and hypoxia/anoxia, and by the production of the cyanotoxin microcystin by the BBD cyanobacteria. Furthermore, in the infected colonies, the expression of all the biomarkers appeared significantly affected by the development stage of the disease. In conclusion, our approach may constitute a useful diagnostic tool, since the cellular stress response of corals is activated before the pathogens colonize the tissues, and expands the current knowledge of the mechanisms controlling the host responses to infection in corals.

Abstract: Hsp90 and its co-chaperones are essential for the medically important parasite Leishmania donovani, facilitating life cycle control and intracellular survival. Activity of Hsp90 is regulated by co-chaperones of the Aha1 and P23 families. In this paper, we studied the expression of L. donovani Aha1 in two life cycle stages, its interaction with Hsp90 and the phenotype of Aha1 null mutants during the insect stage and inside infected macrophages. This study provides a detailed in vitro analysis of the function of Aha1 in Leishmania parasites and the first instance of a reverse genetic analysis of Aha1 in a protozoan parasite. While Aha1 is non-essential under standard growth conditions and at elevated temperature, Aha1 protects against ethanol stress. However, both overexpression and lack of Aha1 affected parasite growth in the presence of the Hsp90 inhibitors radicicol (RAD) and geldanamycin (GA). Under RAD pressure, P23 and Aha1 act in an antagonistic way. By contrast, expression levels of both co-chaperones have similar effects under GA treatment, indicating different inhibition mechanisms by the two compounds. Aha1 is also secreted in virulence-enhancing exosomes. This may explain why the loss of Aha1 reduces the infectivity of L. donovani in ex vivo mouse macrophages, indicating a role during the intracellular mammalian stage.

Abstract: Summary
Obligate intracellular parasites must efficiently invade host cells in order to mature and be transmitted. For the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, invasion of host red blood cells (RBCs) is essential. Here we describe a parasite-specific transcription factor PfAP2-I, belonging to the Apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2) family, that is responsible for regulating the expression of genes involved in RBC invasion. Our genome-wide analysis by ChIP-seq shows that PfAP2-I interacts with a specific DNA motif in the promoters of target genes. Although PfAP2-I contains three AP2 DNA-binding domains, only one is required for binding of the target genes during blood stage development. Furthermore, we find that PfAP2-I associates with several chromatin-associated proteins, including the Plasmodium bromodomain protein PfBDP1 and that complex formation is associated with transcriptional regulation. As a key regulator of red blood cell invasion, PfAP2-I represents a potential new antimalarial therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
The α-oxoaldehyde methylglyoxal is a ubiquitous and highly reactive metabolite known to be involved in aging- and diabetes-related diseases. If not detoxified by the endogenous glyoxalase system, it exerts its detrimental effects primarily by reacting with biopolymers such as DNA and proteins. We now demonstrate that during ketosis, another metabolic route is operative via direct non-enzymatic aldol reaction between methylglyoxal and the ketone body acetoacetate, leading to 3-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione. This novel metabolite is present at a concentration of 10%–20% of the methylglyoxal level in the blood of insulin-starved patients. By employing a metabolite-alkyne-tagging strategy it is clarified that 3-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione is further metabolized to non-glycating species in human blood. The discovery represents a new direction within non-enzymatic metabolism and within the use of alkyne-tagging for metabolism studies and it revitalizes acetoacetate as a competent endogenous carbon nucleophile.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells (B1 astrocytes; NSCs) in the adult ventricular-subventricular-zone (V-SVZ) originate in the embryo. Surprisingly, recent work has shown that B1 cells remain largely quiescent. They are reactivated postnatally to function as primary progenitors for neurons destined for the olfactory bulb and some corpus callosum oligodendrocytes. The cellular and molecular properties of quiescent B1 cells remain unknown. Here we found that a subpopulation of B1 cells has a unique nuclear envelope invagination specialization similar to envelope-limited chromatin sheets (ELCS), reported in certain lymphocytes and some cancer cells. Using molecular markers, [3H]thymidine birth-dating, and Ara-C, we found that B1 cells with ELCS correspond to quiescent NSCs. ELCS begin forming in embryonic radial glia cells and represent a specific nuclear compartment containing particular epigenetic modifications and telomeres. These results reveal a unique nuclear compartment in quiescent NSCs, which is useful for identifying these primary progenitors and study their gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
HLA haplotype-homozygous (HLA-homo) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are being prepared to be used for allogeneic transplantation of regenerated tissue into recipients carrying an identical haplotype in one of the alleles (HLA-hetero). However, it remains unaddressed whether natural killer (NK) cells respond to these regenerated cells. HLA-C allotypes, known to serve as major ligands for inhibitory receptors of NK cells, can be classified into group 1 (C1) and group 2 (C2), based on their binding specificities. We found that the T cells and vascular endothelial cells regenerated from HLA-homo-C1/C1 iPSCs were killed by specific NK cell subsets from a putative HLA-hetero-C1/C2 recipient. Such cytotoxicity was canceled when target cells were regenerated from iPSCs transduced with the C2 gene identical to the recipient. These results clarify that NK cells can kill regenerated cells by sensing the lack of HLA-C expression and further provide the basis for an approach to prevent such NK cell-mediated rejection responses.

Abstract: Summary
CD4 T cells are critical for protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the cause of tuberculosis (TB). Yet to date, TB vaccine candidates that boost antigen-specific CD4 T cells have conferred little or no protection. Here we examined CD4 T cell responses to two leading TB vaccine antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85B, in Mtb-infected mice and in vaccinated humans with and without underlying Mtb infection. In both species, Mtb infection drove ESAT-6-specific T cells to be more differentiated than Ag85B-specific T cells. The ability of each T cell population to control Mtb in the lungs of mice was restricted for opposite reasons: Ag85B-specific T cells were limited by reduced antigen expression during persistent infection, whereas ESAT-6-specific T cells became functionally exhausted due to chronic antigenic stimulation. Our findings suggest that different vaccination strategies will be required to optimize protection mediated by T cells recognizing antigens expressed at distinct stages of Mtb infection.

Abstract: Neddylation inhibitor Pevonedistat (MLN4924) is a novel anticancer drug and has demonstrated broad-spectrum anticancer activity. Nevertheless, we found that Pevonedistat had only a modest apoptotic effect in osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Moreover, we noted that inhibition of neddylation by Pevonedistat led to accumulation of Mcl-1 protein in OS cells. Because Mcl-1 is an important anti-apoptotic protein and also because apoptosis has been shown to be a major cell death pathway, we hypothesized that Mcl-1 accumulation negatively impacted Pevonedistat-mediated anticancer activity in OS cells. In this regard, we employed genetic or pharmacological approaches to inhibit Mcl-1 expression and to examine the effect on Pevonedistat-induced apoptosis in OS cells. We found that inhibition of Mcl-1 expression by siRNA considerably enhanced Pevonedistat-triggered the activation of caspase-3, PARP cleavage and apoptosis, and also dramatically promoted the ability of Pevonedistat to inhibit colony formation of OS cells. Moreover, we observed that flavopiridol, a FDA approved drug, inhibited Mcl-1 expression and substantially enhanced Pevonedistat-mediated activation of apoptosis signaling and significantly augmented cell killing effect in OS cells. Altogether, our study shows that Mcl-1 is a critical resistance factor to Pevonedistat monotherapy, and suggests that Pevonedistat in combinations with flavopiridol may achieve better anticancer therapy.

Abstract: Immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) could provide an unlimited supply of hepatocytes, but insufficient differentiation and phenotypic instability restrict their clinical application. This study aimed to determine the role of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A) in hepatic differentiation of IHH, and whether encapsulation of IHH overexpressing HNF4A could improve liver function and survival in rats with acute liver failure (ALF). Primary human hepatocytes were transduced with lentivirus-mediated catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) to establish IHH. Cells were analyzed for telomerase activity, proliferative capacity, hepatocyte markers, and tumorigenicity (c-myc) expression. Hepatocyte markers, hepatocellular functions, and morphology were studied in the HNF4A-overexpressing IHH. Hepatocyte markers and karyotype analysis were completed in the primary hepatocytes using shRNA knockdown of HNF4A. Nuclear translocation of β-catenin was assessed. Rat models of ALF were treated with encapsulated IHH or HNF4A-overexpressing IHH. A HNF4A-positive IHH line was established, which was non-tumorigenic and conserved properties of primary hepatocytes. HNF4A overexpression significantly enhanced mRNA levels of genes related to hepatic differentiation in IHH. Urea levels were increased by the overexpression of HNF4A, as measured 24h after ammonium chloride addition, similar to that of primary hepatocytes. Chromosomal abnormalities were observed in primary hepatocytes transfected with HNF4A shRNA. HNF4α overexpression could significantly promote β-catenin activation. Transplantation of HNF4A overexpressing IHH resulted in better liver function and survival of rats with ALF compared with IHH. HNF4A improved hepatic differentiation of IHH. Transplantation of HNF4A-overexpressing IHH could improve the liver function and survival in a rat model of ALF.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) provide an unlimited cell source for cell therapies and disease modeling. Despite their enormous power, technical aspects have hampered reproducibility. Here, we describe a modification of PSC workflows that eliminates a major variable for nearly all PSC experiments: the quality and quantity of the PSC starting material. Most labs continually passage PSCs and use small quantities after expansion, but the “just-in-time” nature of these experiments means that quality control rarely happens before use. Lack of quality control could compromise PSC quality, sterility, and genetic integrity, which creates a variable that might affect results. This method, called CryoPause, banks PSCs as single-use, cryopreserved vials that can be thawed and immediately used in experiments. Each CryoPause bank provides a consistent source of PSCs that can be pre-validated before use to reduce the possibility that high levels of spontaneous differentiation, contamination, or genetic integrity will compromise an experiment.

Abstract: Summary
Image-based assays, such as alkaline phosphatase staining or immunocytochemistry for pluripotent markers, are common methods used in the stem cell field to assess pluripotency. Although an increased number of image-analysis approaches have been described, there is still a lack of software availability to automatically quantify pluripotency in large images after pluripotency staining. To address this need, we developed a robust and rapid image processing software, Pluri-IQ, which allows the automatic evaluation of pluripotency in large low-magnification images. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) as a model, we combined an automated segmentation algorithm with a supervised machine-learning platform to classify colonies as pluripotent, mixed, or differentiated. In addition, Pluri-IQ allows the automatic comparison between different culture conditions. This efficient user-friendly open-source software can be easily implemented in images derived from pluripotent cells or cells that express pluripotent markers (e.g., OCT4-GFP) and can be routinely used, decreasing image assessment bias.

Abstract: New methods are needed to reduce dynamic blebbing which inhibits cell attachment and survival during passaging of pluripotent stem cells. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the P2X7 receptor by extracellular ATP during passaging initiates dynamic blebbing. The P2X7 receptor was present in human embryonic stem cells (hESC), but not in differentiating cells. Extracellular ATP concentrations were 14× higher in medium during passaging. Addition of ATP to culture medium prolonged dynamic blebbing and inhibited attachment. Inhibition of P2X7 by specific drugs or by siRNA significantly reduced dynamic blebbing and improved cell attachment. When cells were incubated in calcium chelators (EGTA or BAPTA), blebbing decreased and attachment improved. Calcium influx was observed using Fura-4 when ATP was added to culture medium and inhibited in the presence of the P2X7 inhibitor. Over-expressing activated Rac in hESC reduced blebbing and promoted cell attachment, while a Rac inhibitor prolonged blebbing and reduced attachment. These data identify a pathway involving P2X7 that initiates and prolongs dynamic blebbing during hESC passaging. This pathway provides new insight into factors that increase dynamic blebbing and identifies new targets, such as P2X7, that can be used to improve the culture of cells with therapeutic potential.

Abstract: TRAIL is one of the best anti-cancer molecules in our body. It kills a variety of cancer cells that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy, without causing much negative impact on normal cells, because its death receptors are almost exclusively found on cancer cells. However, some cancer cells are not sensitive to TRAIL treatment, even though they express its death receptors. A second molecule is needed to help TRAIL to complete its mission. Finding such molecules now becomes a top priority in cancer research. Our study shows that CCN1 is such a molecule. CCN1 was highly expressed in the esophageal epithelium of the patients suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease, but faded away as the situation worsened towards adenocarcinoma. Treating the tumor cells with CCN1 resulted in apoptosis, while the same treatment to the normal cells only nourished cell growth. It was TRAIL that mediated this process. Apparently, CCN1 altered the expression profile of TRAIL and its receptors in tumor cells, namely, activating TRAIL and its death receptors and shutting down its decoy receptors. CCN1 and TRAIL worked as a team to put the cancer cells to death, as elimination of either one failed apoptosis.

Abstract: There is tremendous disparity in scientific productivity among nations, particularly in Latin America. At first sight, this could be linked to the relative economic health of the different countries of the region, but even large and relatively rich Latin American countries do not produce a good level of science. Although Latin America has increased the number of its scientists and research institutions in recent years, the gap between developed countries and Latin American countries is startling. The prime importance of science and technology to the development of a nation remains unacknowledged. The major factors contributing to low scientific productivity are the limited access to grant opportunities, inadequate budgets, substandard levels of laboratory infrastructure and equipment, the high cost and limited supply of reagents, and inadequate salaries and personal insecurity of scientists. The political and economic instability in several Latin America countries results in a lack of long-term goals that are essential to the development of science. In Latin America, science is not an engine of the economy. Most equipment and supplies are imported, and national industries are not given the incentives to produce these goods at home. It is a pity that Latin American society has become accustomed to expect new science and technological developments to come from developed countries rather than from their own scientists. In this article, we present a critical view of the Latin American investigator’s daily life, particularly in the area of biomedicine. Too many bright young minds continue to leave Latin America for developed countries, where they are very successful. However, we still have many enthusiastic young graduates who want to make a career in science and contribute to society. Governments need to improve the status of science for the sake of these young graduates who represent the intellectual and economic future of their countries.

It commonly develops in older males, but the number of younger men diagnosed with the disease has increased in recent years. Hormone therapies, such as chemical and surgical methods that inhibit androgen synthesis or androgen receptor (AR) activation, have been used for advanced disease. However, castration-resistant PC (CRPC), which exhibits androgen-independent mechanisms for activating AR, develops after a few years of such treatment and no therapy is available. In this study, we examined differences in the proteomes associated with the androgen-dependent (DHT treatment) and -independent (FSK, forskolin treatment) AR signaling conditions in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we used EPI-001, which inhibits AR-mediated transcriptional activity, to examine whether the observed differences in protein expression were directly affected by AR-mediated mechanisms. A total of 213 protein spots were matched in our 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) analysis and 8 proteins with significant expression changes in our 5 different treatment groups were identified by mass spectrometry. Among these proteins, expression levels of PEPCK-M, catalase, tubulin alpha chain, alpha-enolase, and endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 29 were significantly altered by DHT and the levels of HSP 90 and EF-Tu were changed by FSK. These changes were blocked by EPI-001 in DHT-regulated proteins, PEPCK-M, catalase, and tubulin alpha chain and FSK-regulated EF-Tu protein. The results from our immunohistochemical analysis using in vivo xenograft models were consistent with the 2DE data. We therefore report the first identification of differences in proteins that are significantly regulated under androgen-dependent and -independent AR signaling conditions. Our findings could suggest a possible molecular mechanism through which AR is activated in the absence and/or presence of androgen, and might help explain the inhibitory action of EPI-001 on CRPC.

Abstract: Hes1 is a Notch target gene that plays a major role during embryonic development. Previous studies have shown that HIF-1α can interact with the Notch intracellular domain and enhance Notch target gene expression. In this study, we have identified a Notch-independent mechanism that regulates the responsiveness of the Hes1 gene to hypoxia. Using P19 cells we show that silencing the Notch DNA binding partner CSL does not prevent hypoxia-dependent upregulation of Hes1 expression. In contrast to CSL, knockdown of HIF-1α or Arnt expression prevents Hes1 induction in hypoxia. Deletion analysis of the Hes1 promoter identified a minimal region near the transcription start site that is still responsive to hypoxia. In addition, we show that mutating the GA-binding protein (GABP) motif significantly reduced Hes1 promoter-responsiveness to hypoxia or to HIF-1 overexpression whereas mutation of the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) present in this region had no effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that HIF-1α binds to the proximal region of the Hes1 promoter in a Notch-independent manner. Using the same experimental approach, the presence of GABPα and GABPβ1 was also observed in the same region of the promoter. Loss- and gain-of-function studies demonstrated that Hes1 gene expression is upregulated by hypoxia in a GABP-dependent manner. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that HIF-1α but not HIF-2α is able to interact with either GABPα or GABPβ1. These results suggest a Notch-independent mechanism where HIF-1 and GABP contribute to the upregulation of Hes1 gene expression in response to hypoxia.

Abstract: Diabetic encephalopathy (DE) is one of the most common complications of diabetes. The major pathological variations include neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are caused by tau hyperphosphorylation, and senile plaques (SPs) consisting of amyloid β- protein(Aβ) deposits. In recent years, DE research studies have focused on exploring the activation of the inflammatory signaling pathway in immune cells. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is well known to regulate the inflammatory reactions in immune processes. During the tau hyperphosphorylation process, TLR9 in microglia plays bidirectional roles. However, no studies have clearly demonstrated the relationship between TLR9 and tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons. Based on our experiments, we found significant increase in TLR9 expression in neurons and an increase in tau hyperphosphorylation in high-glucose media. However, these alterations can be reversed by TLR9 inhibitor. Furthermore, we specifically inhibited the activation of P38mitogenactivated protein kinase(P38MAPK) and found an effective decrease in tau hyperphosphorylation. This effect is likely related to Unc93b1. Meanwhile, High glucose levels can induce neuronal apoptosis via the TLR9 signaling pathway. Our studies are the first to reveal that high glucose can regulate tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis via TLR9-P38MAPK signaling pathway. These findings provide a new method for studying the mechanism underlying DE.

Abstract: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) generate in vitro Endothelial Colony Forming Cells (ECFCs) combining features of endothelial and stem/progenitor cells. Their angiogenic properties confer them a therapeutic potential for treating ischemic lesions. They may be isolated from umbilical cord blood (CB-ECFCs) or peripheral adult blood (AB-ECFCs). It is generally accepted that CB-ECFCs are more clonogenic, proliferative and angiogenic than AB-ECFCs. Nevertheless, only a few studies have focused on the functional heterogeneity of CB-ECFCs from different individuals. Moreover, AB-ECFC loss of function is yet to be precisely described. We have focused on these two issues that are critical for clinical perspectives. The detailed clonogenic profile of CB-ECFCs and AB-ECFCs was obtained and revealed a high inter individual heterogeneity and the absence of correlation with age. Most CB-ECFCs yielded initial colonies and had functional properties similar to those of AB-ECFCs. Conversely, a high clonogenicity was associated with an enhanced proliferative and angiogenic potential and stemness gene overexpression, confirming that immaturity, lost by AB-ECFCs, was a prerequisite to functionality. We thus demonstrated the importance of selecting CB-ECFCs according to specific criteria, and we propose using the initial clonogenicity as a relevant marker of their potential efficacy on vascular repair.

Abstract: Summary
Sirtuins are NAD-dependent deacylases. Previous studies have established two important enzymatic intermediates in sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation, an alkylamidate intermediate I, which is then converted to a bicyclic intermediate II. However, how intermediate II is converted to products is unknown. Based on potent SIRT2-specific inhibitors we developed, here we report crystal structures of SIRT2 in complexes with a thiomyristoyl lysine peptide-based inhibitor and carba-NAD or NAD. Interestingly, by soaking crystals with NAD, we capture a distinct covalent catalytic intermediate (III) that is different from the previously established intermediates I and II. In this intermediate, the covalent bond between the S and the myristoyl carbonyl carbon is broken, and we believe this intermediate III to be the decomposition product of II en route to form the end products. MALDI-TOF data further support the intermediate III formation. This is the first time such an intermediate has been captured by X-ray crystallography and provides more mechanistic insights into sirtuin-catalyzed reactions.

Abstract: Summary
The microbiota contributes to colonization resistance against invading pathogens by competing for metabolites, producing inhibitory substances, and priming protective immune responses. However, the specific commensal bacteria that promote host resistance and immune-mediated protection remain largely elusive. Using isogenic mouse lines with distinct microbiota profiles, we demonstrate that severity of disease induced by enteric Salmonella Typhimurium infection is strongly modulated by microbiota composition in individual lines. Transferring a restricted community of cultivable intestinal commensals from protected into susceptible mice decreases S. Typhimurium tissue colonization and consequently disease severity. This reduced tissue colonization, along with ameliorated weight loss and prolonged survival, depends on microbiota-enhanced IFNγ production, as IFNγ-deficient mice do not exhibit protective effects. Innate cells and CD4+ T cells increase in number and show high levels of IFNγ after transfer of the commensal community. Thus, distinct microbiota members prevent intestinal Salmonella infection by enhancing antibacterial IFNγ responses.

Abstract: Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (CCRCC) is a lethal cancer with bad prognosis due to development of chemoresistance and recurrence of more aggressive tumors. Investigation of Gas6-mediated Axl signaling in CCRCC and endothelial cells reveals a Sunitinib resistant Gas6-Axl signaling that is sustained and enhanced and specifically triggers downstream AKT and PRAS40 activation in an intensified manner. Gas6-induced Axl signaling in presence of Sunitinib is also diversified displaying onset of Axl-dependent EGFR and METR activation and activation of classical MAPK pathways. Gas6+Sunitinib-adapted CCRCC cells present increased viability and decreased apoptosis and enhanced production of the multi-tumorigenic Osteopontin (OPN) and of one of its activator matrix metalloproteinase-7. Axl activity is necessary for CCRCC cell sphere formation and the ability of the cells to attach after non-adhesive growth. In addition, Gas6+Sunitinib-adapted CCRCC cells displayed enhanced migration and sphere formation, both mechanisms being Axl and OPN dependent. Altogether, this suggests that Sunitinib while targeting endothelial cells and tumor angiogenesis, simultaneously provides protumorigenic effects due to a constitutively, intensified and divergent Gas6-Axl system.
Implications
Gas6-mediated Axl signaling, which is enhanced and diversified in the presence of Sunitinib possibly contributes to acquired chemoresistance, recurrence of aggressive disease and metastasis of CCRCC tumors. Therefore, combinatorial Axl-targeted therapy might be beneficial for CCRCC patients intended for Sunitinib treatment.

Abstract: The ten mammalian small heat shock proteins (sHSPs/HSPBs) show a different expression profile, although the majority of them are abundant in skeletal and cardiac muscles. HSPBs form hetero-oligomers and homo-oligomers by interacting together and complexes containing, e.g., HSPB2/HSPB3 or HSPB1/HSPB5 have been documented in mammalian cells and muscles. Moreover, HSPB8 associates with the Hsc70/Hsp70 co-chaperone BAG3, in mammalian, skeletal, and cardiac muscle cells. Interaction of HSPB8 with BAG3 regulates its stability and function. Weak association of HSPB5 and HSPB6 with BAG3 has been also reported upon overexpression in cells, supporting the idea that BAG3 might indirectly modulate the function of several HSPBs. However, it is yet unknown whether other HSPBs highly expressed in muscles such as HSPB2 and HSPB3 also bind to BAG3. Here, we report that in mammalian cells, upon overexpression, HSPB2 binds to BAG3 with an affinity weaker than HSPB8. HSPB2 competes with HSPB8 for binding to BAG3. In contrast, HSPB3 negatively regulates HSPB2 association with BAG3. In human myoblasts that express HSPB2, HSPB3, HSPB8, and BAG3, the latter interacts selectively with HSPB8. Combining these data, it supports the interpretation that HSPB8-BAG3 is the preferred interaction.

Abstract: Cytoskeletal organization, actin-myosin contractility and the cell membrane together regulate cell morphology in response to the cell environment, wherein the extracellular matrix (ECM) is an indispensable component. Plasticity in cell shape enables cells to adapt their migration mode to their surroundings. GH3 endocrine cells respond to different ECM proteins, acquiring different morphologies: a rounded on collagen I-III (C I-III) and an elongated on collagen IV (C IV). However, the identities of the molecules that participate in these responses remain unknown. Considering that actin-myosin contractility is crucial to maintaining cell shape, we analyzed the participation of MLCK and ROCK in the acquisition of cell shape, the generation of cellular tension and the cell motility mode. We found that a rounded shape with high cortical tension depends on MLCK and ROCK, whereas in cells with an elongated shape, MLCK is the primary protein responsible for cell spreading. Further, in cells with a slow and directionally persistent motility, MLCK predominates, while rapid and erratic movement is ROCK-dependent. This behavior also correlates with GTPase activation. Cells on C I-III exhibited higher Rho-GTPase activity than cells on C IV and vice versa with Rac-GTPase activity, showing a plastic response of GH3 cells to their environment, leading to the generation of different cytoskeleton and membrane organizations and resulting in two movement strategies, rounded and fibroblastoid-like.

Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of immune-related disorders. Although dysregulation of miRNAs has been implicated in innate and adaptive immune response, the specific effect of miR-20b on TB has not been documented. In this study, downregulation of miR-20b and upregulation of NLRP3 were observed in macrophages of TB patients, increased levels of inflammatory factors secretion were observed in serum of TB patients. Next, we established a TB mice model by using M. tuberculosis infection and intravenous injection of miR-20b mimic. HE staining showed a denser lymphocytic infiltration and extensive tissue necrosis in the lung of TB mice. Lesions in the TB mice displayed a higher bacterial load by plating of lung homogenates. At the same time, lessened miR-20b and activated NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β pathway were observed in TB mice. MiR-20b mimic alleviated the inflammatory response and deactivated the NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β pathway in TB mice. Subsequently, we found that miR-20b induced M2 macrophage polarization by using flow cytometry. In addition, luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-20b directly bind to the 3′-UTR of NLRP3 and regulated its expression negatively. Further, we found that miR-20b mitigated the inflammation and pyroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells co-cultured with macrophages. Our results indicate that miR-20b could alleviate the inflammatory response in TB mice via targeting the NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β pathway, which provides a novel potential molecular mechanism of miR-20b therapy for TB.

Abstract: The small Hsp DmHsp27 from Drosophila melanogaster is one of the few small heat shock proteins (sHsps) found within the nucleus. We report that its dimerization is independent of disulfide bond formation and seems to rely on salt bridges. Unlike metazoan sHsps, DmHsp27 forms two populations of oligomers not in equilibrium. Mutations at highly conserved arginine residues in mammalian sHsps have been reported to be associated with protein conformational defects and intracellular aggregation. Independent mutation of three highly conserved arginines (R122, R131, and R135) to glycine in DmHsp27 results in only one population of higher molecular weight form. In vitro, the chaperone-like activity of wild-type DmHsp27 was comparable with that of its two isolated populations and to the single population of the R122G, R131G, and R135G using luciferase as substrate. However, using insulin, the chaperone-like activity of wild-type DmHsp27 was lower than that of R122G and R131G mutants. Altogether, the results characterize wild-type DmHsp27 and its alpha-crystallin domain (ACD) arginine mutants and may give insight into protection mechanism of sHsps.

Abstract: Summary
Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) offer considerable potential for the treatment of demyelinating diseases and injuries of the CNS. However, generating large quantities of high-quality OPCs remains a substantial challenge that impedes their therapeutic application. Here, we show that OPCs can be generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in a three-dimensional (3D), scalable, and fully defined thermoresponsive biomaterial system. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a NKX2.2-EGFP human embryonic stem cell reporter line that enabled fine-tuning of early OPC specification and identification of conditions that markedly increased the number of OLIG2+ and NKX2.2+ cells generated from hPSCs. Transplantation of 50-day-old OPCs into the brains of NOD/SCID mice revealed that progenitors generated in 3D without cell selection or purification subsequently engrafted, migrated, and matured into myelinating oligodendrocytes in vivo. These results demonstrate the potential of harnessing lineage reporter lines to develop 3D platforms for rapid and large-scale production of OPCs.

Analyzing surface epitopes of single HIV particles holds great potential for the development of vaccine candidates. However, existing technologies do not allow corresponding screens at high throughput. We present here a single-virus droplet-based microfluidics platform enabling sorting of millions of HIV-1 particles with >99% efficiency, based on the expression of epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. We show that virus particles displaying these epitopes can be identified, sorted, and analyzed by next-generation sequencing: an approximately 1,900-fold enrichment of viral particles displaying neutralizing epitopes could be obtained in a single sort, thus opening the way for screening diverse virus libraries with optimal antigenic features for HIV vaccine candidates.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) must sense and adapt to immune pressures such as acidic pH during pathogenesis. The goal of this study was to isolate compounds that inhibit acidic pH resistance, thus defining virulence pathways that are vulnerable to chemotherapy. Here, we report that the compound AC2P36 selectively kills Mtb at acidic pH and potentiates the bactericidal activity of isoniazid, clofazimine, and diamide. We show that AC2P36 activity is associated with thiol stress and causes an enhanced accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species at acidic pH. Mechanism of action studies demonstrate that AC2P36 directly depletes Mtb thiol pools, with enhanced depletion of free thiols at acidic pH. These findings support that Mtb is especially vulnerable to thiol stress at acidic pH and that chemical depletion of thiol pools is a promising target to promote Mtb killing and potentiation of antimicrobials.

Abstract: Summary
Adventitial progenitor cells, including SCA-1+ and mesenchymal stem cells, are believed to be important in vascular remodeling. It has been shown that SCA-1+ progenitor cells are involved in neointimal hyperplasia of vein grafts, but little is known concerning their involvement in hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerosis. We employed single-cell sequencing technology on primary adventitial mouse SCA-1+ cells from wild-type and atherosclerotic-prone (ApoE-deficient) mice and found that a group of genes controlling cell migration and matrix protein degradation was highly altered. Adventitial progenitors from ApoE-deficient mice displayed an augmented migratory potential both in vitro and in vivo. This increased migratory ability was mimicked by lipid loading to SCA-1+ cells. Furthermore, we show that lipid loading increased miRNA-29b expression and induced sirtuin-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels to promote cell migration. These results provide direct evidence that blood cholesterol levels influence vascular progenitor cell function, which could be a potential target cell for treatment of vascular disease.

Abstract: Summary
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive neoplasm characterized by a poor patient survival rate, because of rapid tumor recurrence following first-line therapy. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are assumed to be responsible for initiating tumorigenesis and driving relapse after therapeutic interventions. CSC-enriched MM cell subpopulations were identified by an OCT4/SOX2 reporter approach and were characterized by (1) increased resistance to cisplatin, (2) increased sensitivity toward the FAK inhibitor VS-6063 in vitro, and (3) a higher tumor-initiating capacity in vivo in orthotopic xenograft and allograft mouse models. Overexpression of NF2 (neurofibromatosis 2, merlin), a tumor suppressor often mutated or lost in MM, did not affect proliferation and viability of CSC-enriched MM populations but robustly decreased the viability of reporter-negative cells. In contrast, downregulation of calretinin strongly decreased proliferation and viability of both populations. In summary, we have enriched and characterized a small MM cell subpopulation that bears the expected CSC characteristics.

PSA-NCAM is involved in cellular processes such as differentiation, plasticity, and migration, and is elevated in Alzheimer's disease as well as in metastatic tumour cells. Our previous work demonstrated that insulin enhances the abundance of cell surface PSA by inhibiting PSA-NCAM endocytosis. In the present study we have identified a mechanism for insulin-dependent inhibition of PSA-NCAM turnover affecting cell migration. Insulin enhanced the phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase leading to dissociation of αv-integrin/PSA-NCAM clusters, and promoted cell migration. Our results show that αv-integrin plays a key role in the PSA-NCAM turnover process. αv-integrin knockdown stopped PSA-NCAM from being endocytosed, and αv-integrin/PSA-NCAM clusters co-labelled intracellularly with Rab5, altogether indicating a role for αv-integrin as a carrier for PSA-NCAM during internalisation. Furthermore, inhibition of p-FAK caused dissociation of αv-integrin/PSA-NCAM clusters and counteracted the insulin-induced accumulation of PSA at the cell surface and cell migration was impaired. Our data reveal a functional association between the insulin/p-FAK-dependent regulation of PSA-NCAM turnover and cell migration through the extracellular matrix. Most importantly, they identify a novel mechanism for insulin-stimulated cell migration.

Abstract: The double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase (PKR), which is activated by double stranded RNA, induces inflammation by regulating NF-κB signaling. The NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome also modulates inflammation in response to infection. Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.gingivalis) is an oral bacterium which is implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. We previously reported that PKR is a key modulator of bone metabolism and inflammation in the periodontal tissue. PKR was also reported to induce inflammation in response to microbes by regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting that PKR could affect inflammation along with NLRP3 in periodontal diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of PKR on NLRP3 expression and NF-κB activity in P. gingivalis infected osteoblasts. We first constructed a SNAP26b-tagged P.gingivalis (SNAP-P. g.) and traced its internalization into the cell. SNAP-P. g. increased the activity of PKR and NF-κB and also induced NLRP3 expression in osteoblasts. Inhibition of NF-κB attenuated SNAP-P. g.-induced NLRP3 expression. The knockdown of PKR using shRNA decreased both the activity of NF-κB and the expression of NLRP3 induced by SNAP-P.g.. We therefore concluded that in osteoblasts, P. gingivalis activated PKR, which in turn increased NLRP3 expression by activating NF-κB. Our results suggest that PKR modulates inflammation by regulating the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome through the NF-κB pathway in periodontal diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Cytosolic nucleic acid sensing elicits interferon production for primary antiviral defense through cascades controlled by protein ubiquitination and Ser/Thr phosphorylation. Here we show that TBK1, a core kinase of antiviral pathways, is inhibited by tyrosine phosphorylation. The Src family kinases (SFKs) Lck, Hck, and Fgr directly phosphorylate TBK1 at Tyr354/394, to prevent TBK1 dimerization and activation. Accordingly, antiviral sensing and resistance were substantially enhanced in Lck/Hck/Fgr triple knockout cells and ectopic expression of Lck/Hck/Fgr dampened the antiviral defense in cells and zebrafish. Small-molecule inhibitors of SFKs, which are conventional anti-tumor therapeutics, enhanced antiviral responses and protected zebrafish and mice from viral attack. Viral infection induced the expression of Lck/Hck/Fgr through TBK1-mediated mobilization of IRF3, thus constituting a negative feedback loop. These findings unveil the negative regulation of TBK1 via tyrosine phosphorylation and the functional integration of SFKs into innate antiviral immunity.

Abstract: DEPDC1 (DEP domain containing 1) is overexpressed in multiple cancers and is associated with cell cycle progression. In this report, we have investigated the expression, localization, phosphorylation and function of DEPDC1 during mitosis. DEPDC1 has two isoforms (isoform a and isoform b), and both of them are increased in mitosis and degraded once cells exit mitosis. DEPDC1a is localized to the centrosome in metaphase, whereas DEPDC1b is localized to the entire cell cortex during mitosis. DEPDC1a, but not DEPDC1b, was required for the integrity of centrosome and organization of the bipolar spindle. Mass spectrometry and biochemical analyses revealed phosphorylation of DEPDC1 at Ser110. The phosphorylation of Ser110 is essential for localization of DEPDC1a to the centrosome. Consistently, non-phosphorylation mutants of DEPDC1a did not rescue disruption of centrosome organization by depletion of endogenous DEPDC1. Our results show a novel role for DEPDC1 in maintaining centrosome integrity during mitosis for the accurate distribution of chromosomes.

Abstract: The enzyme β-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1) catalyzes the breakdown of provitamin A, including beta-carotene (BC), into retinal, prior to its oxidation into retinoic acid (RA). Allelic variation at the BCO1 locus results in differential expression of its mRNA and affects carotenoid metabolism specifically in chicken Pectoralis major muscle. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential myogenic effect of BC and the underlying mechanisms in chicken myoblasts. BCO1 mRNA was detected in myoblasts derived from chicken satellite cells. Treating these myoblasts with BC led to a significant decrease in BrdU incorporation. This anti-proliferative effect was confirmed by a cell cycle study using flow cytometry. BC also significantly increased the differentiation index, suggesting a positive effect on the commitment of avian myoblasts to myogenic differentiation. Addition of DEAB, a specific inhibitor of RALDH activity, significantly reduced BC anti-proliferative and pro-differentiating effects, suggesting that BC exerted its biological effect on chicken myoblasts through activation of the RA pathway. We also observed that in myoblast showing decreased BCO1 expression consecutive to a natural mutation or to a siRNA treatment, the response to BC was inhibited. Nevertheless, BCO1 siRNA transfection increased expression of BCO2 which inhibited cell proliferation in control and BC treated cells.

Abstract: Summary
Drugs that increase 26S proteasome activity have potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. A chemical genetics screen of over 2,750 compounds using a proteasome activity probe as a readout in a high-throughput live-cell fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based assay revealed more than ten compounds that increase proteasome activity, with the p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316 being one of the most potent ones. Genetic and chemical inhibition of either p38 MAPK, its upstream regulators, ASK1 and MKK6, and downstream target, MK2, enhance proteasome activity. Chemical activation of the 26S proteasome increases PROTAC-mediated and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation and decreases the levels of both overexpressed and endogenous α-synuclein, without affecting the overall protein turnover. In addition, survival of cells overexpressing toxic α-synuclein assemblies is increased in the presence of p38 MAPK inhibitors. These findings highlight the potential of activation of 26S proteasome activity and that this can be achieved through multiple mechanisms by distinct molecules.

Abstract: Germ cells have been considered “the ultimate stem cell” because they alone, during normal development of sexually reproducing organisms, are able to give rise to all organismal cell types. Morphological descriptions of a specialized cytoplasm termed ‘germ plasm’ and associated electron dense ribonucleoprotein (RNP) structures called ‘germ granules’ within germ cells date back as early as the 1800s. Both germ plasm and germ granules are implicated in germ line specification across metazoans. However, at a molecular level, little is currently understood about the molecular mechanisms that assemble these entities in germ cells. The discovery that in some animals, the gene products of a small number of lineage-specific genes initiate the assembly (also termed nucleation) of germ granules and/or germ plasm is the first step towards facilitating a better understanding of these complex biological processes. Here, we draw on research spanning over 100years that supports the hypothesis that these nucleator genes may have evolved convergently, allowing them to perform analogous roles across animal lineages.

Abstract: Summary
Respiratory and arthropod-borne viral infections are a global threat due to the lack of effective antivirals and vaccines. A potential strategy is to target host proteins required for viruses but non-essential for the host. To identify such proteins, we performed a genome-wide knockout screen in human haploid cells and identified the calcium pump SPCA1. SPCA1 is required by viruses from the Paramyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Togaviridae families, including measles, dengue, West Nile, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. Calcium transport activity is required for SPCA1 to promote virus spread. SPCA1 regulates proteases within the trans-Golgi network that require calcium for their activity and are critical for virus glycoprotein maturation. Consistent with these findings, viral glycoproteins fail to mature in SPCA1-deficient cells preventing viral spread, which is evident even in cells with partial loss of SPCA1. Thus, SPCA1 is an attractive antiviral host target for a broad spectrum of established and emerging viral infections.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cells hold great promise for regenerative medicine since they can differentiate into all somatic cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) could be important for the regulation of these cell-fate decisions. Profiling of miRNAs revealed 19 differentially expressed miRNAs in the endoderm and 29 in the mesoderm when analyzing FACS-purified cells derived from human embryonic stem cells. The mesodermal-enriched miR-483-3p was identified as an important regulator for the generation of mesodermal PDGFRA+ paraxial cells. Repression of its target PGAM1 significantly increased the number of PDGFRA+ cells. Furthermore, miR-483-3p, miR-199a-3p, and miR-214-3p might also have functions for the mesodermal progenitors. The endoderm-specific miR-489-3p and miR-1263 accelerated and increased endoderm differentiation upon overexpression. KLF4 was identified as a target of miR-1263. RNAi-mediated downregulation of KLF4 partially mimicked miR-1263 overexpression. Thus, the effects of this miRNA were mediated by facilitating differentiation through destabilization of pluripotency along with other not yet defined targets.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factors p65 and IRF3 play key roles in the induction of cellular antiviral responses. Phosphorylation of p65 and IRF3 is required for their activity and constitutes a key checkpoint. Here we report that viral infection induced upregulation of INKIT, an inhibitor for NF-κB and IRF3 that restricted innate antiviral responses by blocking phosphorylation of p65 and IRF3. INKIT overexpression inhibited virus-induced phosphorylation of p65 and IRF3 and expression of downstream genes. In contrast, knockdown or knockout of INKIT had the opposite effect: Inkit−/− mice produced elevated levels of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines and were more resistant to lethal viral infection compared to wild-type. INKIT interacted with IKKα/β and TBK1/IKKɛ, impairing the recruitment and phosphorylation of p65 and IRF3. Viral infection induced IKK-mediated phosphorylation of INKIT at Ser58, resulting in its dissociation from the IKKs. Our findings thus uncover INKIT as a regulator of innate antiviral responses.

Abstract: Summary
To resolve the subcellular distribution of endolysosomal ion channels, we have established a novel experimental approach to selectively patch clamp Rab5 positive early endosomes (EE) versus Rab7/LAMP1-positive late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/LY). To functionally characterize ion channels in endolysosomal membranes with the patch-clamp technique, it is important to develop techniques to selectively enlarge the respective organelles. We found here that two small molecules, wortmannin and latrunculin B, enlarge Rab5-positive EE when combined but not Rab7-, LAMP1-, or Rab11 (RE)-positive vesicles. The two compounds act rapidly, specifically, and are readily applicable in contrast to genetic approaches or previously used compounds such as vacuolin, which enlarges EE, RE, and LE/LY. We apply this approach here to measure currents mediated by TRPML channels, in particular TRPML3, which we found to be functionally active in both EE and LE/LY in overexpressing cells as well as in endogenously expressing CD11b+ lung-tissue macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Modulation of transcription, either synthetic activation or repression, via dCas9-fusion proteins is a relatively new methodology with the potential to facilitate high-throughput up- or downregulation studies of gene function. Genetic studies of neurodevelopmental disorders have identified a growing list of risk variants, including both common single-nucleotide variants and rare copy-number variations, many of which are associated with genes having limited functional annotations. By applying a CRISPR-mediated gene-activation/repression platform to populations of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells, neurons, and astrocytes, we demonstrate that it is possible to manipulate endogenous expression levels of candidate neuropsychiatric risk genes across these three cell types. Although proof-of-concept studies using catalytically inactive Cas9-fusion proteins to modulate transcription have been reported, here we present a detailed survey of the reproducibility of gRNA positional effects across a variety of neurodevelopmental disorder-relevant risk genes, donors, neural cell types, and dCas9 effectors.

Abstract: Summary
Human pancreatic α-amylase (HPA) is responsible for degrading starch to malto-oligosaccharides, thence to glucose, and is therefore an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. Here we report the discovery of a unique lariat nonapeptide, by means of the RaPID (Random non-standard Peptides Integrated Discovery) system, composed of five amino acids in a head-to-side-chain thioether macrocycle and a further four amino acids in a 310 helical C terminus. This is a potent inhibitor of HPA (Ki = 7 nM) yet exhibits selectivity for the target over other glycosidases tested. Structural studies show that this nonapeptide forms a compact tertiary structure, and illustrate that a general inhibitory motif involving two phenolic groups is often accessed for tight binding of inhibitors to HPA. Furthermore, the work reported here demonstrates the potential of this methodology for the discovery of de novo peptide inhibitors against other glycosidases.

Abstract: Summary
Diarrhea is a host response to enteric pathogens, but its impact on pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By infecting mice with the attaching and effacing bacteria Citrobacter rodentium, we defined the mechanisms and contributions of diarrhea and intestinal barrier loss to host defense. Increased permeability occurred within 2 days of infection and coincided with IL-22-dependent upregulation of the epithelial tight junction protein claudin-2. Permeability increases were limited to small molecules, as expected for the paracellular water and Na+ channel formed by claudin-2. Relative to wild-type, claudin-2-deficient mice experienced severe disease, including increased mucosal colonization by C. rodentium, prolonged pathogen shedding, exaggerated cytokine responses, and greater tissue injury. Conversely, transgenic claudin-2 overexpression reduced disease severity. Chemically induced osmotic diarrhea reduced colitis severity and C. rodentium burden in claudin-2-deficient, but not transgenic, mice, demonstrating that claudin-2-mediated protection is the result of enhanced water efflux. Thus, IL-22-induced claudin-2 upregulation drives diarrhea and pathogen clearance.

Abstract: Lung cancer metastasis causes 70% of an estimated 1.4 million deaths per annum. The major shortcoming in lung cancer is the tendency to have inherent or develop acquired resistance to chemotherapy. It is now evolving that such resistance might develop due to differential contribution and interaction with tumor microenvironment, stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix. The objective of the current study was to define the lung cancer tumor microenvironment. We have identified multiple tumor-infiltrating T lymphocyte subsets in patients with lung cancer, which were independent of disease stage. Functional analysis indicated high expression of the inhibitory receptors, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), lymphocyte activated gene 3 (LAG3) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) in both CD4 and CD8 subsets, compared to non-malignant controls. Inhibitory receptors expressed by the tumor infiltrating T cells might mediate tolerance to tumor antigens with co-expression of these receptors exacerbating lung carcinogenesis and metastatic progression.

Abstract: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in breast cancer cell metastasis. Both (megakaryoblastic leukemia)/myocardin-like 1 (MKL-1) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) have been implicated in the control of cellular metabolism, survival and growth. Our previous study has shown that cooperativity of MKL-1 and STAT3 promoted breast cancer cell migration. Herein, we demonstrate a requirement for MKL-1 and STAT3 in miRNA-mediated cellular EMT to affect breast cancer cell migration. Here we show that cooperativity of MKL-1 and STAT3 promoted the EMT of MCF-7 cells. Importantly, MKL-1 and STAT3 promoted the expression of Vimentin via its promoter CArG box. Interestingly, miR-93-5p inhibits the EMT of breast cancer cells through suppressing the expression of MKL-1 and STAT3 via targeted their 3’UTR. These results demonstrated a novel pathway through which miR-93-5p regulates MKL-1 and STAT3 to affect EMT controlling breast cancer cell migration.

Abstract: Keratinocytes (KCs) and Langerhans cells (LCs) contribute to create the epidermal barrier. To form a functional epidermis, KCs express filaggrin and Toll-like Receptors (TLRs). LCs are the first line of epidermal defence and can be activated by interleukin (IL)-17 and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha. In psoriasis, an alteration of TLR expression, a defective expression of filaggrin, and LC activation occur. In organotypic cultures of human skin we investigated the interplay between IL-17 and TNF-alpha on i) expression of filaggrin, TLR2, 7 and 9, and Nuclear Factor (NF)-kB localization by immunofluorescence and ii) LC ultrastructural features by transmission electron microscopy. Normal human skin was obtained after aesthetic surgery (n=7), overnight incubated in a Transwell system, and exposed to TNF-alpha and/or IL-17 for 24 (T24), 48 (T48), and 72 (T72) hours. Cytokines always influenced the expression of filaggrin. TNF-alpha alone activated LCs only starting from T48. TLR2 and TLR7 expressions were affected at T24 by IL-17 and the combination of cytokines, but not by TNF-alpha. TLR9-positive cells were detectable in the granular layer after cytokine exposure. A nuclear localization of NF-kB was always observed after cytokine incubation. In conclusion, each cytokine possess an intrinsic activity on the different components of the epidermal barrier.

Abstract: The oxygen-sensitive hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway plays a central role in the control of erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. The discovery of prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins as key regulators of HIF activity has led to the development of inhibitory compounds that are now in phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of renal anemia, a condition that is commonly found in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. This review provides a concise overview of clinical effects associated with pharmacologic PHD inhibition and was written in memory of Professor Lorenz Poellinger.

Abstract: Osteoclasts are multinucleated bone-resorbing cells that are formed by fusion of monocyte/macrophage lineage. Osteoclasts and macrophages generate podosomes that are actin-based dynamic organelles implicated in cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and degradation. However, the detailed mechanisms of podosome organization remain unknown. Here, we identified the Rho-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (Rho-GEF) Plekhg5 as an up-regulated gene during differentiation of osteoclasts from macrophages. Knockdown of Plekhg5 with small interfering RNA in both macrophages and osteoclasts induced larger cell formation with impaired cell polarity and resulted in an elongated and flattened shape. In macrophages, Plekhg5 depletion enhanced random migration, but impaired directional migration, adhesion, and matrix degradation. Plekhg5 in osteoclasts affected random migration, podosome organization, and bone resorption. Plekhg5 depletion affected signaling and localization of several Rho downstream effectors. In fact, end-binding protein 1 (EB1), cofilin and vinculin were abnormally localized in Plekhg5-depleted cells, and mDia1 and LIM kinase (LIMK)1 were upregulated in Plekhg5-depleted cells compared with control cells. However, overexpression of Plekhg5 in macrophages induced an increase in its mRNA level, but failed to increase the protein level, indicating that overexpressed Plekhg5 was degraded in macrophages but not HEK293T cells. Thus, Plekhg5 affects cell polarity, migration, adhesion, degradation, and podosome organization in macrophages and osteoclasts.

Abstract: Lorenz Poellinger was a leader in understanding the effects of altered microenvironmental conditions in tumor biology and in normal physiology. His work examining the effects of hypoxia and the HIF transcription factors has expanded our understanding of the role of the microenvironment in affecting the behaviour of both normal and malignant cells. Furthermore, his work provides a model for understanding the adaptive responses to other metabolic stress conditions. By investigating the molecular mechanisms responsible for the adaptive responses to metabolic stress in normal physiological situations, across pathological conditions, and in different model organisms, his work shows the power of combining data from different model systems and physiological contexts. In cancers, it has become clear that in order to evolve to become an aggressive malignant disease, tumor cells must acquire the capacity to tolerate a host of abnormal and stressful metabolic conditions. This metabolic stress can be thought of as a fire that tumor cells must douse with enough water to survive, and may offer opportunities to exploit smoldering vulnerabilities in order to eradicate malignant cells.

Abstract: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) exerts pleiotropic effects including bone turnover and immune system regulation. It inhibits both T and B cell proliferation while decreasing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and immunoglobulins. 1,25(OH)2D also modulates monocyte-macrophage and osteoclast (OC) maturation. Since we have previously described that malignant plasma cells may trans-differentiate towards the myeloid lineage participating to skeletal devastation in multiple myeloma (MM), we here evaluated in vitro the role of 1,25(OH)2D in this lineage switch. We investigated the gene and protein expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in MM cell lines. Thus, after cell treatment with 1,25(OH)2D, we analyzed their morphology and the expression of myeloid and OC markers. Finally, we assessed their bone resorption property on calcium phosphate slices. All MM cells expressed VDR in nuclear and perinuclear sites. Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D altered their morphology from round to fusiform, while inducing paxillin focalization. 1,25(OH)2D administration also up-regulated myeloid and OC genes, including C/EBPα, RANK, M-CSFR and V-ATPase, whose promoters contain potential 1,25(OH)2D responsive elements. Finally, 1,25(OH)2D increased MM cell capability to generate pits of erosion on calcium phosphate discs. This data suggest that myeloma cells may undergo a functional trans-differentiation into OCs and, under appropriate experimental conditions, 1,25(OH)2D triggers this lineage switch.

Abstract: The hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) promote changes in gene expression in response to hypoxia, and mediate key physiological responses such as angiogenesis. They play important roles in development and normal physiology, as well as in ischaemic and other pathologies. The human eye is a complex organ, with tight regulation of vascularisation and oxygen delivery, with the highly specialised retina containing both highly vascularised and avascular regions. This review, written to honour the significant contribution of Lorenz Poellinger to this field, covers the role of the HIFs in normal development of the eye, specifically the vasculature, as well as their roles in numerous retinal pathologies, including ischaemic retinopathies, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The characterisation of the HIFs in the eye has improved our understanding of the development, function, and numerous pathologies of the eye, and should inform future therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Oxidative stress mediated secondary injury contributes to neurological deterioration after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Astrocytes, the most dominant cells in the central nervous system (CNS), play key roles in maintaining redox homeostasis by providing oxidative stress defense. Hemoglobin (Hb), the primary component released by hemolysis, is an effective activator of astrocytes. Hemin, the product of Hb degradation, is highly toxic due to the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We speculate that Hb-activated astrocytes are resistant to hemin-induced toxicity. To verify our speculation, Hb-pretreated astrocytes were exposed to hemin, intracellular ROS accumulation and cell apoptosis were evaluated. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and nuclear transcription factor-erythroid 2 related factor (Nrf2) expression were observed to explore the potential mechanism. The results demonstrated that Hb induced upregulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in astrocytes, resulted in HO-1 upregulation, which contributed to reduced ROS accumulation and apoptosis rate. Knocking down Nrf2 expression by siRNA suppressed Hb-induced upregulation of HO-1 expression and increased the susceptibility of Hb-pretreated astrocytes to hemin-induced toxicity. Taken together, Hb-activated astrocytes acquired resistance to hemin-induced toxicity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. This phenomenon can be considered as the adaptive self-defense in the pathological process of ICH. Hb pre-warned astrocytes and enhanced their capability of handling the coming hemin “flood”. Nrf2/HO-1 may be employed as a target for neuroprotection after ICH.

Abstract: Studies have shown that nuclear envelope fission (karyokinesis) in budding yeast depends on cytokinesis, but not distinguished whether this was a direct requirement, indirect, because of cell cycle arrest, or due to bud neck-localized proteins impacting both processes. To determine the requirements for karyokinesis, we examined mutants conditionally defective for bud emergence and/or nuclear migration. The common mutant phenotype was completion of the nuclear division cycle within the mother cell, but karyokinesis did not occur. In the cdc24 swe1 mutant, at the non-permissive temperature, multiple nuclei accumulated within the unbudded cell, with connected nuclear envelopes. Upon return to the permissive temperature, the cdc24 swe1 mutant initiated bud emergence, but only the nucleus spanning the neck underwent fission suggesting that the bud neck region is important for fission initiation. The neck may be critical for either mechanical reasons, as the contractile ring might facilitate fission, or for regulatory reasons, as the site of a protein network regulating nuclear envelope fission, mitotic exit, and cytokinesis. We also found that 77–85% of pairs of septin mutant nuclei completed nuclear envelope fission. In addition, 27% of myo1Δ mutant nuclei completed karyokinesis. These data suggested that fission is not dependent on mechanical contraction at the bud neck, but was instead controlled by regulatory proteins there.

Abstract: Summary
Clearance of bacteria by macrophages involves internalization of the microorganisms into phagosomes, which are then delivered to endolysosomes for enzymatic degradation. These spatiotemporally segregated processes are not known to be functionally coupled. Here, we show that lysosomal degradation of bacteria sustains phagocytic uptake. In Drosophila and mammalian macrophages, lysosomal dysfunction due to loss of the endolysosomal Cl− transporter ClC-b/CLCN7 delayed degradation of internalized bacteria. Unexpectedly, defective lysosomal degradation of bacteria also attenuated further phagocytosis, resulting in elevated bacterial load. Exogenous application of bacterial peptidoglycans restored phagocytic uptake in the lysosomal degradation-defective mutants via a pathway requiring cytosolic pattern recognition receptors and NF-κB. Mammalian macrophages that are unable to degrade internalized bacteria also exhibit compromised NF-κB activation. Our findings reveal a role for phagolysosomal degradation in activating an evolutionarily conserved signaling cascade, which ensures that continuous uptake of bacteria is preceded by lysosomal degradation of microbes.

Abstract: Summary
A recurring challenge in cell biology is to define the molecular components of macromolecular complexes of interest. The predominant method, immunoprecipitation, recovers only strong interaction partners that survive cell lysis and repeated detergent washes. We explored peroxidase-catalyzed proximity biotinylation, APEX, as an alternative, focusing on the mitochondrial nucleoid, the dynamic macromolecular complex that houses the mitochondrial genome. Via 1-min live-cell biotinylation followed by quantitative, ratiometric mass spectrometry, we enriched 37 nucleoid proteins, seven of which had never previously been associated with the nucleoid. The specificity of our dataset was very high, and we validated three hits by follow-up studies. For one novel nucleoid-associated protein, FASTKD1, we discovered a role in downregulation of mitochondrial complex I via specific repression of ND3 mRNA. Our study demonstrates that APEX is a powerful tool for mapping macromolecular complexes in living cells, and can identify proteins and pathways that have been missed by traditional approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue integrity requires constant maintenance of a quiescent, yet responsive, population of stem cells. In the skin, hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) that reside within the bulge maintain tissue homeostasis in response to activating cues that occur with each new hair cycle or upon injury. We found that PTEN, a major regulator of the PI3K-AKT pathway, controlled HFSC number and size in the bulge and maintained genomically stable pluripotent cells. This regulatory function is central for HFSC quiescence, where PTEN-deficiency phenotype is in part regulated by BMAL1. Furthermore, PTEN ablation led to downregulation of BMI-1, a critical regulator of adult stem cell self-renewal, and elevated senescence, suggesting the presence of a protective system that prevents transformation. We found that short- and long-term PTEN depletion followed by activated BMAL1, a core clock protein, contributed to accumulation of HFSC.

Abstract: Summary
Cordycepin (COR) and pentostatin (PTN) are adenosine analogs with related bioactivity profiles as both mimic adenosine and can inhibit some of the processes that are adenosine dependent. Both COR and PTN are also natural products and were originally isolated from the fungus Cordyceps militaris and the bacterium Streptomyces antibioticus, respectively. Here, we report that not only is PTN produced by C. militaris but that biosynthesis of COR is coupled with PTN production by a single gene cluster. We also demonstrate that this coupling is an important point of metabolic regulation where PTN safeguards COR from deamination by inhibiting adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity. ADA is not inhibited until COR reaches self-toxic levels, at which point ADA derepression occurs allowing for detoxification of COR to 3′-deoxyinosine. Finally, we show that using our biosynthetic insights, we can engineer C. militaris to produce higher levels of COR and PTN.

Abstract: Summary
The human tumor viruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) establish persistent infections in B cells. KSHV is linked to primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and 90% of PELs also contain EBV. Studies on persistent KSHV infection in vivo and the role of EBV co-infection in PEL development have been hampered by the absence of small animal models. We developed mice reconstituted with human immune system components as a model for KSHV infection and find that EBV/KSHV dual infection enhanced KSHV persistence and tumorigenesis. Dual-infected cells displayed a plasma cell-like gene expression pattern similar to PELs. KSHV persisted in EBV-transformed B cells and was associated with lytic EBV gene expression, resulting in increased tumor formation. Evidence of elevated lytic EBV replication was also found in EBV/KSHV dually infected lymphoproliferative disorders in humans. Our data suggest that KSHV augments EBV-associated tumorigenesis via stimulation of lytic EBV replication.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired human oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (hOPC) differentiation likely contributes to failed remyelination in multiple sclerosis. The characterization of molecular pathways that regulate hOPC differentiation will provide means to induce remyelination. In this study, we determined the gene expression profile of PDGFαR+ hOPCs during initial oligodendrocyte commitment. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was used to define progenitor and differentiation-specific gene expression modules and functionally important hub genes. These modules were compared with rodent OPC and oligodendrocyte data to determine the extent of species conservation. These analyses identified G-protein β4 (GNB4), which was associated with hOPC commitment. Lentiviral GNB4 overexpression rapidly induced human oligodendrocyte differentiation. Following xenograft in hypomyelinating shiverer/rag2 mice, GNB4 overexpression augmented myelin synthesis and the ability of hOPCs to ensheath host axons, establishing GNB4 as functionally important in human myelination. As such, network analysis of hOPC gene expression accurately predicts genes that influence human oligodendrocyte differentiation in vivo.

Abstract: The ability of cells to sense and adapt to changes in oxygen is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Immune cells function in physiologically complex and varying environments whereby oxygen, pH, nutrients, metabolites and cytokines are continuously fluctuating. HIF is well known to play an important role in coordinating the adaptation and function of both innate immune cells and T cells in these complex environments. This review summarises recent discoveries concerning how hypoxia and HIF control B cell behaviour, and regulate antibody quality and decisions concerning tolerance. Hypoxia and HIF activation may provide an important context; coordinating metabolism with variable demands for quiescence, rapid proliferation, and differentiation. Understanding when and how HIF is activated during B cell development and response is important as drugs targeting HIF could influence antibody responses, providing novel therapeutic opportunities for vaccine adjuvants and in treating autoimmunity.

Abstract: Recently, studies have been suggested that H3K27me3 is implicated with maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs), however, the roles of H3K27me3 in Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) remain poorly investigated. Here we explore the functionallities of H3K27me3 on BCSCs, we identify H3K27me3 as a negative modulator of BCSCs and suggest GSKJ4 is a promising drug targeting BCSCs. We show that the H3K27me3 level is decreased in mammosphere-derived BCSCs. In breast cancer cells, we demonstrate that GSKJ4 could markedly inhibit the proliferation. Strikingly, we show that GSKJ4 could effectively suppress BCSCs including expansion, self-renewal capacity, and the expression of stemness-related markers. Additionally, our xenograft model confirms that GSKJ4 is able to effectively inhibit the tumorigenicity of MDA-MB-231. Mechanistically, the inhibition effects of GSKJ4 on BCSCs are via inhibiting demethylases JMJD3 and UTX with methyltransferase EZH2 unchanged, which enhances H3K27me3 level. H3K27me3 activating leads to reduction of BCSCs expansion, self-renewal and global level of stemness factors. Collectively, our results provide strong supports that H3K27me3 exerts a suppressive influence on BCSCs and reveal that GSKJ4 is capable to be a prospective agent targeting BCSCs.

Abstract: Renal ischemia reperfusion (IR) is a major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and no effective treatments have been established. Tisp40 is a transcription factor of the CREB/ATF family and involves in cell apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation, but its role in renal IR remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of Tisp40 in renal IR injury. In vivo, Tisp40 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to thirty minutes of bilateral renal ischemia and 48h reperfusion, the blood and kidneys were harvested for analysis. In vitro, Tisp40 overexpression and vector cells were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR), the apoptosis rate and the expressions of related proteins were measured. Following IR, the expressions of Tisp40 protein, serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and apoptosis of tubular cells were significantly increased in WT mice. However, Tisp40 deficiency significantly attenuated the increase of sCr, BUN and apoptosis of tubular cells. Following HR, apoptosis of tubular cells was increased in Tisp40 overexpression cells compared with vector cells. Mechanistically, Tisp40 promoted the expressions of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Bax and Cleaved caspase3 and suppressed the expression of Bcl-2 in renal IR injury. In conclusion, Tisp40 aggravates tubular cells apoptosis in renal IR injury.

Abstract: Summary
The POU transcription factor OCT4 is critical for maintaining the undifferentiated state of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), but its precise mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of OCT4 phosphorylation in the biological functions of ESCs. We observed that c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) directly interacted with and phosphorylated OCT4 at serine 347, which inhibited the transcriptional activity of OCT4. Moreover, phosphorylation of OCT4 induced binding of FBXW8, which reduced OCT4 protein stability and enhanced its proteasomal degradation. We also found that the mutant OCT4 (S347A) might delay the differentiation process of mouse ESCs and enhance the efficiency of generating iPSCs. These results demonstrated that OCT4 phosphorylation on serine 347 by JNKs plays an important role in its stability, transcriptional activities, and self-renewal of mouse ESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Simultaneous hyperactivation of Wnt and antioxidant response (AR) are often observed during oncogenesis. However, it remains unclear how the β-catenin-driven Wnt and the Nrf2-driven AR mutually regulate each other. The situation is compounded because many players in these two pathways are redox sensors, rendering bolus redox signal-dosing methods uninformative. Herein we examine the ramifications of single-protein target-specific AR upregulation in various knockdown lines. Our data document that Nrf2/AR strongly inhibits β-catenin/Wnt. The magnitude and mechanism of this negative regulation are dependent on the direct interaction between β-catenin N terminus and β-TrCP1 (an antagonist of both Nrf2 and β-catenin), and independent of binding between Nrf2 and β-TrCP1. Intriguingly, β-catenin positively regulates AR. Because AR is a negative regulator of Wnt regardless of β-catenin N terminus, this switch of function is likely sufficient to establish a new Wnt/AR equilibrium during tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The loss of cone photoreceptors that mediate daylight vision represents a leading cause of blindness, for which cell replacement by transplantation offers a promising treatment strategy. Here, we characterize cone differentiation in retinas derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Similar to in vivo development, a temporal pattern of progenitor marker expression is followed by the differentiation of early thyroid hormone receptor β2-positive precursors and, subsequently, photoreceptors exhibiting cone-specific phototransduction-related proteins. We establish that stage-specific inhibition of the Notch pathway increases cone cell differentiation, while retinoic acid signaling regulates cone maturation, comparable with their actions in vivo. MESC-derived cones can be isolated in large numbers and transplanted into adult mouse eyes, showing capacity to survive and mature in the subretinal space of Aipl1−/− mice, a model of end-stage retinal degeneration. Together, this work identifies a robust, renewable cell source for cone replacement by purified cell suspension transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Liver or hepatocytes transplantation is limited by the availability of donor organs. Functional hepatocytes independent of the donor sources may have wide applications in regenerative medicine and the drug industry. Recent studies have demonstrated that chemical cocktails may induce reprogramming of fibroblasts into a range of functional somatic cells. Here, we show that mouse fibroblasts can be transdifferentiated into the hepatocyte-like cells (iHeps) using only one transcription factor (TF) (Foxa1, Foxa2, or Foxa3) plus a chemical cocktail. These iHeps show typical epithelial morphology, express multiple hepatocyte-specific genes, and acquire hepatocyte functions. Genetic lineage tracing confirms the fibroblast origin of these iHeps. More interestingly, these iHeps are expandable in vitro and can reconstitute the damaged hepatic tissues of the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-deficient (Fah−/−) mice. Our study provides a strategy to generate functional hepatocyte-like cells by using a single TF plus a chemical cocktail and is one step closer to generate the full-chemical iHeps.

Abstract: The structure and chaperone function of DmHsp22WT, a small Hsp of Drosophila melanogaster localized within mitochondria were examined. Mutations of conserved arginine mutants within the alpha-crystallin domain (ACD) domain (R105G, R109G, and R110G) were introduced, and their effects on oligomerization and chaperone function were assessed. Arginine to glycine mutations do not induce significant changes in tryptophan fluorescence, and the mutated proteins form oligomers that are of equal or smaller size than the wild-type protein. They all form oligomer with one single peak as determined by size exclusion chromatography. While all mutants demonstrate the same efficiency as the DmHsp22WT in a DTT-induced insulin aggregation assay, all are more efficient chaperones to prevent aggregation of malate dehydrogenase. Arginine mutants of DmHsp22 are efficient chaperones to retard aggregation of CS and Luc. In summary, this study shows that mutations of arginine to glycine in DmHsp22 ACD induce a number of structural changes, some of which differ from those described in mammalian sHsps. Interestingly, only the R110G-DmHsp22 mutant, and not the expected R109G equivalent to human R140-HspB1, R116-HspB4, and R120-HspB5, showed different structural properties compared with the DmHsp22WT.

Abstract: Mitochondrial trifunctional protein α-subunit (MTPα) is involved in the fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) pathway. Two MTPα activities, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and long-chain hydratase, have been linked with the occurrence and development of obesity and obesity-related disorders. These activities catalyze two steps in the FAO pathway (the second and third reactions). However, the role of MTPα in the pathogenesis of obesity has not been evaluated, and the functional role of MTPα in adipocyte differentiation has not been determined. Here, we analyzed the functional role of MTPα using in vitro and in vivo models of adipogenesis. MTPα expression was upregulated during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells into adipocytes. MTPα gene silencing stimulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein alpha(C/EBPα) expression, which promoted adipocyte differentiation. By contrast, MTPα overexpression blocked adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Further analysis showed that MTPα positively regulated sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Injection of preadipocytes overexpressing MTPα into athymic mice significantly impaired de novo fat pad formation compared with that of the control, and furthermore MTPα knockdown enhances fat pad formation at a time point earlier than 5-week, such as week-2 and week-3, when the control fat pad is not fully developed. In summary, our data indicate that MTPα is a novel factor that negatively regulates adipocyte differentiation. We propose a pathway in which MTPα inhibits adipogenesis by promoting SIRT1 expression, which represses PPARγ and attenuates adipogenesis.

Abstract: RNA splicing takes place in the nucleus and occurs either co- or post-transcriptionally. Noncoding sequences (introns) in nuclear mRNA precursors (pre-mRNA) are removed by dedicated splicing machinery. The coding sequences (exons) are joined to generate the mature mRNA that is exported to the cytoplasm and translated into protein. Splicing events are tissue-specific. This process plays an important role in cellular differentiation and organism development. The splicing machinery heavily contributes to biological complexity and especially to the ability of cells to adapt to different developmental stages and altered cellular conditions. A striking change has been observed in alternative splicing pattern of genes and alterations in splicing factor expression under pathologic conditions especially in human cancers. Cancer cells are often confronted with a significant reduction in oxygen availability, which is a major reason for changeover of major cellular processes. Hypoxic regions have been identified within all solid tumors and their presence has been linked to malignant progression, metastasis, resistance to therapy, and poor clinical outcomes following treatment. Cellular responses to hypoxia are mediated by hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs). This review focuses on currently available data how pre-mRNAs splicing contributes to cellular adaptation to hypoxic conditions, to genes which alternative splicing is regulated dependent on hypoxia and how regulation of alternative splicing under hypoxic conditions is achieved.

Abstract: Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), an endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducible transcription factor, plays important roles in cancer progression and resistance to therapy. However, no report is available about its roles in endometrial cancer (EC). In this study, we found that ATF4 is commonly expressed in EC cell lines. Loss-of-function studies in two EC cell lines showed that ATF4 knockdown suppresses tumor growth of EC in vivo without influencing cell proliferation in vitro. And xenograft tumors derived from ATF4-knockdown cells had reduced M2 macrophage infiltration. In clinical specimens, ATF4-high expressing tumors indeed contained more macrophage infiltration compared to those with lower ATF4 expression. Moreover, we identified that ATF4-mediated chemokine CCL2 expression ultimately results in macrophage infiltration and tumor growth of EC. Taken together, our findings suggest that ATF4 contributes to tumor growth of EC by promoting CCL2 and subsequent recruitment of macrophage, and that ATF4/CCL2 axis might be a potential therapeutic target for EC.

Abstract: Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) plays an important role in stress responses such as misfolded protein-induced aggresomes, autophagy, and stress granules. However, precisely how HDAC6 manages response during and after cellular stress remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of HDAC6 on various stress and post-stress recovery responses. We showed that HIF-1α protein levels were reduced in HDAC6 knockout (KO) MEFs compared to wild-type (WT) MEFs in hypoxia. Furthermore, under hypoxia, HIF-1α levels were also reduced following rescue with either a catalytically inactive or a ubiqiutin-binding mutant HDAC6. HDAC6 deacetylated and upregulated the stability of HIF-1α, leading to activation of HIF-1α function under hypoxia. Notably, both the deacetylase and ubiquitin-binding activities of HDAC6 contributed to HIF-1α stabilization, but only deacetylase activity was required for HIF-1α transcriptional activity. Suppression of HDAC6 enhanced the interaction between HIF-1α and HSP70 under hypoxic conditions. In addition to hypoxia, depletion of HDAC6 caused hypersensitivity to cell death during oxidative stress and post-stress recovery. However, HDAC6 depletion had no effect on cell death in response to heat shock or ionizing radiation. Overall, our data suggest that HDAC6 may serve as a critical stress regulator in response to different cellular stresses.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the urgent need for assays to visualize insulin secretion there is to date no reliable method available for measuring insulin release from single cells. To address this need, we developed a genetically encoded reporter termed RINS1 based on proinsulin superfolder GFP (sfGFP) and mCherry fusions for monitoring insulin secretion. RINS1 expression in MIN6 β cells resulted in proper processing yielding single-labeled insulin species. Unexpectedly, glucose or drug stimulation of insulin secretion in β cells led to the preferential release of the insulin-sfGFP construct, while the mCherry-fused C-peptide remained trapped in exocytic granules. This physical separation was used to monitor glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ratiometrically by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in single MIN6 and primary mouse β cells. Further, RINS1 enabled parallel monitoring of pulsatile insulin release in tolbutamide-treated β cells, demonstrating the potential of RINS1 for investigations of antidiabetic drug candidates at the single-cell level.

Abstract: In this study, we reported that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) CCAT1 was upregulated in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissues, and was associated with FIGO stage, histological grade, lymph node metastasis and poor survival of EOC patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that CCAT1 was an independent prognostic indicator. While CCAT1 downregulation inhibited EOC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasion, CCAT1 upregulation promoted EOC cell EMT, migration and invasion. We further identified and confirmed that miR-152 and miR-130b were the targets of CCAT1, and CCAT1 functioned by targeting miR-152 and miR-130b. Subsequently, ADAM17 and WNT1, and STAT3 and ZEB1 were confirmed to be the targets of miR-152 and miR-130b, respectively, and could be regulated by CCAT1 in EOC cells. Knockdown of anyone of these four proteins inhibited EOC cell EMT, migration and invasion. Taken together, our study first revealed a critical role of CCAT1-miR-152/miR-130b-ADAM17/WNT1/STAT3/ZEB1 regulatory network in EOC cell metastasis. These findings provide great insights into EOC initiation and progression, and novel potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis for EOC.

Abstract: Summary
The embryonic origin of lineage precursors of the trunk dermis is somewhat controversial. Precursor cells traced by Myf5 and Twist2 (Dermo1) promoter activation (i.e., cells of presumed dermomyotomal lineage) have been reported to generate Schwann cells. On the other hand, abundant data demonstrate that dermal Schwann cells derive from the neural crest. This is relevant because dermal precursors give rise to neural lineages, and multilineage differentiation potential qualifies them as adult stem cells. However, it is currently unclear whether neural lineages arise from dedifferentiated Schwann cells instead of mesodermally derived dermal precursor cells. To clarify these discrepancies, we traced SOX2+ adult dermal precursor cells by two independent Myf5 lineage tracing strains. We demonstrate that dermal Schwann cells do not belong to the Myf5+ cell lineage, indicating that previous tracing data reflected aberrant cre recombinase expression and that bona fide Myf5+ dermal precursors cannot transdifferentiate to neural lineages in physiological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Fucosylation is a glycan modification critically involved in cancer and inflammation. Although potent fucosylation inhibitors are useful for basic and clinical research, only a few inhibitors have been developed. Here, we focus on a fucose analog with an alkyne group, 6-alkynyl-fucose (6-Alk-Fuc), which is used widely as a detection probe for fucosylated glycans, but is also suggested for use as a fucosylation inhibitor. Our glycan analysis using lectin and mass spectrometry demonstrated that 6-Alk-Fuc is a potent and general inhibitor of cellular fucosylation, with much higher potency than the existing inhibitor, 2-fluoro-fucose (2-F-Fuc). The action mechanism was shown to deplete cellular GDP-Fuc, and the direct target of 6-Alk-Fuc is FX (encoded by TSTA3), the bifunctional GDP-Fuc synthase. We also show that 6-Alk-Fuc halts hepatoma invasion. These results highlight the unappreciated role of 6-Alk-Fuc as a fucosylation inhibitor and its potential use for basic and clinical science.

Abstract: Comparative studies of primordial germ cell (PGC) development across organisms in many phyla reveal surprising diversity in the route of migration, timing and underlying molecular mechanisms, suggesting that the process of migration itself is conserved. However, beyond the perfunctory transport of cellular precursors to their later arising home of the gonads, does PGC migration serve a function? Here we propose that the process of migration plays an additional role in quality control, by eliminating PGCs incapable of completing migration as well as through mechanisms that favor PGCs capable of responding appropriately to migration cues. Focusing on PGCs in mice, we explore evidence for a selective capacity of migration, considering the tandem regulation of proliferation and migration, cell-intrinsic and extrinsic control, the potential for tumors derived from failed PGC migrants, the potential mechanisms by which migratory PGCs vary in their cellular behaviors, and corresponding effects on development. We discuss the implications of a selective role of PGC migration for in vitro gametogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Taxanes are a mainstay of treatment for breast cancer, but resistance often develops followed by metastatic disease and mortality. Aiming to reveal the mechanisms underlying taxane resistance, we used breast cancer patient-derived orthoxenografts (PDX). Mimicking clinical behavior, triple-negative breast tumors (TNBCs) from PDX models were more sensitive to docetaxel than luminal tumors, but they progressively acquired resistance upon continuous drug administration. Mechanistically, we found that a CD49f+ chemoresistant population with tumor-initiating ability is present in sensitive tumors and expands during the acquisition of drug resistance. In the absence of the drug, the resistant CD49f+ population shrinks and taxane sensitivity is restored. We describe a transcriptional signature of resistance, predictive of recurrent disease after chemotherapy in TNBC. Together, these findings identify a CD49f+ population enriched in tumor-initiating ability and chemoresistance properties and evidence a drug holiday effect on the acquired resistance to docetaxel in triple-negative breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Host factors in the intestine help select for bacteria that promote health. Certain commensals can utilize mucins as an energy source, thus promoting their colonization. However, health conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are associated with a reduced mucus layer, potentially leading to dysbiosis associated with this disease. We characterize the capability of commensal species to cleave and transport mucin-associated monosaccharides and identify several Clostridiales members that utilize intestinal mucins. One such mucin utilizer, Peptostreptococcus russellii, reduces susceptibility to epithelial injury in mice. Several Peptostreptococcus species contain a gene cluster enabling production of the tryptophan metabolite indoleacrylic acid (IA), which promotes intestinal epithelial barrier function and mitigates inflammatory responses. Furthermore, metagenomic analysis of human stool samples reveals that the genetic capability of microbes to utilize mucins and metabolize tryptophan is diminished in IBD patients. Our data suggest that stimulating IA production could promote anti-inflammatory responses and have therapeutic benefits.

Abstract: Preeclampsia(PE) is a pregnancy complication that is diagnosed by the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria. The etiology of PE remains unclear; however, growing evidence indicates that mitochondrial impairment contributes to the pathogenesis. Therefore, we aim to investigate the function of mitochondria in the development of PE. The mitochondrial metabolome in preeclamptic (n = 11) and normal (n = 11) placentas were analyzed using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Student's t-tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted to determine which mitochondrial metabolites differed significantly between the two groups. The Pathway Activity Profiling (PAPi) R package was used to predict which metabolic pathways were affected by PE. Western blot analysis was performed to identify the candidate proteins which were associated with mitochondrial repair regulation. GC-MS analysis demonstrated that higher levels of 38 metabolites and lower levels of 2 metabolites were observed in the placenta of patients with severe PE (sPE). Five fatty acids had an area under the ROC curve above 90%. Furthermore, we revealed abnormal regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, autophagy, and biogenesis in sPE. Our discoveries indicate that the compromised lipid metabolism in sPE may result from dysfunctional mitochondria, thus revealing new insights into the etiology of the disease.

Abstract: Summary
Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) can improve cognition in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, AD is a protracted disorder, and prior studies have examined only short-term effects. We therefore used an immune-deficient model of AD (Rag-5xfAD mice) to examine long-term transplantation of human NSCs (StemCells Inc.; HuCNS-SCs). Five months after transplantation, HuCNS-SCs had engrafted and migrated throughout the hippocampus and exhibited no differences in survival or migration in response to β-amyloid pathology. Despite robust engraftment, HuCNS-SCs failed to terminally differentiate and over a quarter of the animals exhibited ectopic human cell clusters within the lateral ventricle. Unlike prior short-term experiments with research-grade HuCNS-SCs, we also found no evidence of improved cognition, no changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and no increase in synaptic density. These data, while disappointing, reinforce the notion that individual human NSC lines need to be carefully assessed for efficacy and safety in appropriate long-term models.
