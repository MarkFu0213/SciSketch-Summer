Abstract: It is shown in this paper that indeed silicon nanotechnology can significantly improve the performance of solar cells made on low-cost materials like polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si) thin films formed on glass substrates. By proper engineering of the nanowires (cleaning of the metal contamination from the metal-assisted wet chemical etching and passivation by a-Si:H emitter as well as by an ultrathin Al2O3 tunnel layer on the emitter surface) and by proper design of the cell structure (superstrate configuration), the detrimental effects related to the nanowires can be avoided while the light trapping properties remain. In superstrate configuration with an Ag reflector, a prototype solar cell with efficiency of 10% has been realized on a pc-Si thin film with a thickness of only 8µm formed on glass, resulting from an enhanced photocurrent due to light trapping by silicon nanowires. Further optimization steps are discussed and targeted to improve the efficiency and the performance of the solar cells.

Abstract: We demonstrate for the first time the efficiency improvement of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-fullerene (C60) bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells by the introduction of trace concentrations of carbon black (CB) into the photoactive layer. As compared to control devices with only C60, the addition of low concentration (12.5ppm) of CB resulted in 35% improvement in short circuit current density (Jsc), and 79% improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). CB served the dual function of enhancing electron transport as well as optimizing phase separation leading to high current density and PCE. The results indicate that CB is a promising additive for the performance enhancement of polymer photovoltaic cells and may work with diverse donor–acceptor systems.

Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate an efficient inverted polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells using solution processed interfacial layer by mixing zinc oxide (ZnO) with cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) for ideal electron extraction and transport. The optimized inverted BHJ solar cell with n-type mixed (ZnO:Cs2CO3) electron transport layer and blend of poly (3-hexylthiophene):Indene-C60 bisadduct as a photoactive layer shows a power conversion efficiency as high as 5.29%. This performance enhancement is attributed to improved interfacial contact between photoactive layer and electron extraction layer, low leakage current, and a suitable surface morphology for electron extraction and transport.

Abstract: A kind of solid–solid phase change materials (SSPCMs), melamine/formaldehyde/polyethylene glycols (MFPEG) crosslinking copolymers, was synthesized referring to the reaction mechanism and conditions of amine–aldehyde condensation reaction and aldolization. The composition and chemical structure, thermophysical and crystallographic properties of MFPEG crosslinking copolymers were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (1H NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry analysis system (TGA), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD) and polarization optical microscopy (POM). The results indicate that MFPEGs crosslinking copolymers possess excellent phase change properties and an applicable temperature range. The maximal latent heat enthalpies of heating and cooling cycle are 109.4 and 103.9J/g, respectively. The decomposing temperature range of MFPEGs is about 340–455°C in nitrogen atmosphere.

Abstract: Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) are the ideal material for extreme conditions thanks to very high melting points, high refractoriness and good thermo-mechanical properties at high temperatures. This paper reports, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, on the microstructural and optical characterization of several tantalum diboride (TaB2) samples with density values from 67% to full density. Pristine samples have been investigated at room temperature by means of SEM, XRD and spectral hemispherical reflectance measurements. Thermal emittance in the temperature range 1050–1800K has been measured. Structural, compositional and optical properties after high temperature exposure have been characterized as well and property changes have been explained. The obtained results favorably compare TaB2 over conventional solar absorbers for novel solar plants operating at higher temperatures.

Abstract: Tissue engineering and regenerative biology are usually discussed in relation to biomedical research and applications. However, hand in hand with developments of this field in the biomedical context, other approaches and uses for non-medical ends have been explored. There is a growing interest in exploring spin off tissue engineering and regenerative biology technologies in areas such as consumer products, art and design. This paper outlines developments regarding in vitro meat and leather, actuators and bio-mechanic interfaces, speculative design and contemporary artistic practices. The authors draw on their extensive experience of using tissue engineering for non-medical ends to speculate about what lead to these applications and their possible future development and uses. Avoiding utopian and dystopian postures and using the notion of the contestable, this paper also mentions some philosophical and ethical consideration stemming from the use of non-medical approaches to tissue constructs.

Abstract: This review summarizes the optical and electrical models of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) and numerically simulates and analyzes the performance of the PSCs. A complete simulation of a conventional BHJ device based on the polymer P3HT is presented and results are compared with the experimental data. Key factors affecting the device performance, including the photo absorption, quantum efficiency, short-circuit current, fill factor, and open-circuit voltage of the device, are analyzed and summarized. Simulations on inverted, semitransparent, and large-area PSCs are performed and findings are compared with experimental results. Simulations reveal the effects of optical spacer layers, different thicknesses, carrier mobilities, light intensities, contact barriers, effective bandgaps, recombination coefficients, and energy-level bending on the quantum efficiency, short-circuit current, fill factor, and open-circuit voltage of the PSCs. Differences between conventional and inverted geometry, opacity and semitransparency, and small and large-area PSCs are discussed based on the simulations. A power conversion efficiency of 11.0% is predicted for the PSC based on P3HT. Results suggest the need to further reduce the series resistance in large-area PSCs.

Abstract: Secondary concentrators are used in solar concentrating systems to redirect solar beams reflected by the primary concentrators to the focal point or line. These components allow to increase the concentrated solar flux density and hence to lower thermal radiation losses. Solar reflectors for secondary concentrators are permanently exposed to environmental conditions, high radiation fluxes and elevated temperatures that potentially cause stress and degradation throughout the time. Therefore, analyzing solar reflectors of secondary concentrators by simulating these conditions is crucial. No previous research works about the durability of solar reflector materials for secondary concentrators have been reported. The present work is focused on studying the degradation of the reflector materials by simulating accelerated aging, caused by several ambient parameters and the effect of concentrated radiation. Both cooled and uncooled systems for secondary concentrators are included in this study. According to results obtained, aluminum reflectors and thin silvered-glass reflectors glued to an aluminum structure showed minimum reflectance losses and structural degradation under the operation conditions of cooled 3D secondary concentrators (tower systems). Following critical aspects to avoid reflector degradation were identified: to select a suitable adhesive material to glue the thin silvered-glass reflector to the support aluminum structure, to properly protect reflectors edges, to design a suitable cooling system and to avoid the combination of high radiation fluxes with mechanical stress. In addition, laminated silvered-glass reflectors have shown to be suitable for uncooled 2D secondary concentrators (Fresnel collectors). Furthermore, a comparison with naturally aged secondary concentrators using silvered-glass reflectors glued to an aluminum structure revealed that the simulated degradation under accelerated conditions performed in this work did reproduce the most frequent degradation patterns suffered in real operating conditions.

Abstract: Based on a GaSb thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell with a box-shaped Zn diffusion profile, a theoretical model of the generation and drift of the photogenerated minority carriers in the cell was established, and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the cell was predicted with the classical semiconductor theory. The calculated results agreed well with the measurements. It is determined that reducing the front surface recombination velocity (Sn) could improve the IQE of the emitter region, whereas increasing the lifetime of holes (τh) could improve the IQE of the base region. The Zn diffusion duration has a large influence on the IQE at short wavelengths below 1200nm. Compared with the IQE for the 5h diffusion time, the IQE of the 2h counterpart was improved dramatically. Front surface etching could increase the IQE at short wavelengths below 700nm while there was a decrease in the IQE for wavelengths above 700nm. Thus, front surface etching is not necessary for a cell with a box-shaped Zn diffusion profile because the IQE for the near infrared wavelengths are the most important. The calculated results were elucidated by analyzing the distribution of the minority carriers generated in the cell and their recombination processes.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged recently as key regulatory molecules with diverse roles at almost every level of the regulation of gene expression. The roles of these RNAs in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF); a lethal multisystem, autosomal recessive disorder have yet to be explored. Our aim was to examine the expression profile of lncRNA, in the airway epithelium of people with CF. We examined the expression of 30,586 lncRNAs by microarray (Human LncRNA Array v3.0, Arraystar, Inc.), in vivo in bronchial cells isolated from endobronchial brushings obtained from CF and non-CF individuals. In total, we identified 1,063 lncRNAs with differential expression between CF and non-CF individuals (fold change ≥3, p≤0.001). The microarray also contained probes for ∼26,109 protein coding transcripts, of which 720 were differentially expressed between CF and non-CF brush samples (fold change ≥3, p≤0.001). Confirmation of a selection of differentially expressed coding mRNA and lncRNA transcripts such as XIST and TLR8 was achieved using qRT-PCR. Gene ontology bioinformatics analysis highlighted that many processes over-represented in the CF bronchial epithelium are related to inflammation. These data show a significantly altered lncRNA and mRNA expression profile in CF bronchial cells in vivo. Dysregulation of some of these lncRNAs may play important roles in the chronic infection and inflammation that exists in the lungs of people with CF.

Abstract: Endothelial dysfunction is decisive and leads to the development of several inflammatory diseases. Endotoxemia-derived sepsis syndrome exhibits a broad inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction. We reported previously that the endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induces the conversion of endothelial cells (ECs) into activated fibroblasts, showing a myofibroblast-like protein expression profile. Enhanced migration is a hallmark of myofibroblast function. However, the mechanism involved in LPS-induced EC migration is no totally understood. Some studies have shown that the transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) ion channel is involved in fibroblast and tumor cell migration through the regulation of calcium influx. Furthermore, LPS modulates TRPM7 expression. However, whether TRPM7 is involved in LPS-induced EC migration remains unknown. Here, we study the participation of LPS as an inducer of EC migration and study the mechanism underlying evaluating the participation of the TRPM7 ion channel. Our results demonstrate that LPS induced EC migration in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, this migratory process was mediated by the TLR-4/NF-κB pathway and the generation of ROS through the PKC-activated NAD(P)H oxidase. In addition, LPS increased the intracellular calcium level and the number of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-positive focal adhesions in EC. Finally, we demonstrate that using TRPM7 blockers or suppressing TRPM7 expression through siRNA successfully inhibits the calcium influx and the LPS-induced EC migration. These results point out TRPM7 as a new target in the drug design for several inflammatory diseases that impair vascular endothelium function.

Abstract: Crystalline Si solar cells that exhibit potential-induced degradation of the shunting type (PID-s) are investigated on a microstructural level. Cell pieces with PID-shunts are imaged by SEM using the EBIC technique in order to investigate PID-s positions with high lateral resolution. ToF-SIMS depth profiles reveal Na accumulation localized at these shunt positions. Subsequently, cross-sectional FIB-lamellas of individual PID-shunts have been prepared. TEM is applied to a number of PID-s defects. TEM/EDX measurements reveal that stacking faults crossing the p–n junction are decorated with Na causing PID-s. These defects are further characterized by high resolution STEM methods down to the atomic scale. A model for the shunting mechanism in PID-s affected solar cells is developed. The results are discussed with respect to different shunting mechanisms.

Ubiquitination of the transcription factor c-MAF is mediated by multiple lysine residues,

Abstract: The transcription factor c-MAF could be polyubiquitinated and subsequently degraded in the proteasomes. Theoretically, any lysine residues in c-MAF could be ubiquitinated. In the present study, we tried to find out the specific lysine residue(s) mediating c-MAF ubiquitination. Through a series of mutational screens from lysine (K) to arginine (R), we found that any single lysine mutation (K to R) failed to prevent c-MAF ubiquitination, and any single lysine residue alone could not mediate c-MAF ubiquitination, which indicated that multiple lysine residues were required for c-MAF ubiquitination. Bioinformatics and computing analyses revealed that K85 and K350 could mediate c-MAF ubiquitination, which was confirmed by the cell-based assays. However, this duo was not the only pair because the K85R/K350R mutant could also be ubiquitinated. Functionally, both M12 (K85/K350) and W12 (K85R/K350R) mutants increased cyclin D2 promoter-driven luciferase activity, but they were less potent than the lysine-free counterpart (M14). In addition, M14 induced a higher level of expression of cyclin D2 at both mRNA and protein levels. Therefore, we demonstrated that c-MAF ubiquitination is mediated by multiple lysine residues, of which K85 and K350 were sufficient but not the only residues in mediating c-MAF ubiquitination. Moreover, c-MAF was found to be degraded by lysosomes. This study added a novel insight for c-MAF ubiquitination and degradation, suggesting that c-MAF stability is strictly regulated.

Abstract: The purpose of this work is to: 1) improve a previously developed behavioural model (B-model) for photovoltaic modules and 2) validate it using experimental data. The major advantages of the new model are its simplicity and the fact that it is based only on the module׳s electrical properties available on the manufacturer׳s datasheet. At first, the original model was developed and validated using a rich experimental database solely for a polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic module. However, an improved version of this model along with validation tests which use a larger database is presented in this paper. The larger database utilises the measured I–V characteristics of three other photovoltaic technologies such as, monocrystalline silicon, CIS and CdTe. To permit a sound and relatively easy entry into the study of photovoltaic for novices and newcomers, a detailed flowchart and description of its use are presented. Also a concrete example of an application using the flowchart is presented to display its efficiency and ease of use.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a strong commercial push toward thinner silicon in the solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies due to the significant cost reduction associated with it. Tensile stress (normal, in-plane) and fracture of the silicon cells are increasingly observed and reported for products of crystalline solar cell technologies. In an effort to shed light on these topics, stress measurements and mapping of the solar cells in the vicinity of the most typically observed crack initiation locations using synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction technique was conducted and are reported in this paper. The technique is unique as it has the capabilities to quantitatively determine stresses in silicon and to map these stresses with a micron resolution, all while the silicon cells are already encapsulated. With this technique, we aim to gain fundamental understanding of the stress magnitudes as well as characteristics that could lead to crack initiation and propagation. We have thus far found evidences of both extrinsic (device related) as well as intrinsic (crystallographic) nature of silicon cracking, which further confirm that the control of mechanical stress is the key to enable thin silicon solar cell technologies in the coming years. This study represents an ongoing high impact technology research that addresses real and important fundamental materials issue facing the crystalline silicon solar PV industry and contributes directly to the industry drive to reduce cost of PV systems to grid parity.

Abstract: Solution processed CdTe layers are a potentially low-cost alternative for use in thin-film solar cells. We have recently reported the use of such nanocrystalline layers within ITO/CdTe/ZnO/Al device architectures. One key concern with this type of device structure is the possibility of atomic scale interdiffusion between the ITO and CdTe layers, which can result in deleterious n-type doping of the CdTe layer. Rutherford Backscattering has been used to study the chemical composition across the ITO/CdTe interface as a function of thermal annealing temperature. Through these measurements we verify that interdiffusion is observed across the interface for annealing temperatures above 200°C, and the extent of interdiffusion increases with temperature. Ultra-thin alumina, zirconia and titania layers deposited between the ITO and CdTe layers have been studied for their potential to act as a diffusion barrier. All investigated barriers successfully suppress interdiffusion. The outcomes of these compositional studies are directly compared to solar cells fabricated under analogous processing conditions, demonstrating improved cell performance.

Abstract: We have used Stille coupling polymerization to synthesize new crystalline deep HOMO level polymers, PhBDT-BT and PhBDT-DTBT, which consist of 4,8-bis(2-octyldodecyloxyphenyl)-benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (PhBDT) as an effective electron donor unit and 4,7-dibromobenzo [c] [1], [2], [5] thiadiazole (BT), or 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)benzo[c] [1], [2], [5] thiadiazole (DTBT) units as electron acceptor units. Both polymers exhibited a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, −5.43 for PhBDT-BT, −5.66eV for PhBDT-DTBT) to obtain a high open circuit voltage (Voc). The band gaps of PhBDT-BT and PhBDT-DTBT were tuned to 1.72 and 1.69eV, respectively. As a result, bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices derived from these polymers and fullerenes provided open-circuit voltages (Voc) as high as 0.73 for PhBDT-BT/PC70BM (1:2) and 0.86V for PhBDT-DTBT/PC70BM (1:2). In particular, photovoltaic devices fabricated from the PhBDT-DTBT/PC70BM (1:2) blend system exhibited an excellent photovoltaic (PV) performance with a Voc value of 0.73V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) value of 7.06mA/cm2, a fill factor (FF) value of 0.67, and a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.5%. In addition, organic thin film transistor (OTFT) devices using PhBDT-DTBT as the semiconductor also showed excellent performance with a value of hole mobility of 4.7×10−2cm2V−1s−1. In the PhBDT-DTBT, the thiophene bridge between the PhBDT and benzthiadiazole provides enough space for the intedigitaion of the bulky alkoxyphenyl side chains, increasing the planarity with enhanced π–π stacking.

Abstract: We describe the growth, characterization and performance evaluation of a multilayer solar selective coating useful for solar thermal power generation. The solar selective coating of the present work consists of Ti/chrome interlayer, two absorber layers of AlTiN and AlTiON, and an anti-reflection layer of AlTiO. All the layers have been deposited using reactive pulsed direct current sputtering of Ti and Al targets in Ar+N2, Ar+N2+O2 and Ar+O2 plasmas, respectively. A large number of analytical tools have been used to characterize the structural and optical properties of the absorber coating. The optimized coating exhibited an absorptance of 0.930 and an emittance of 0.16–0.17 on stainless steel substrates and an absorptance of 0.933 and an emittance of 0.07 on copper substrates. The absorber coating displayed improved adhesion, UV stability, corrosion resistance and thermal stability in air and vacuum up to 350 and 450°C, respectively under cyclic heating condition for more than 1000h.

Abstract: This work reports on the effect of Na doping on hole concentration in CIGS thin film solar cells deposited on polyimide substrate. Two methods of Na supply were applied in this investigation: Na containing back contact layers (Mo:Na) and NaF evaporation at different stages of the absorber deposition, including the post-growth Na treatment. The results of hole concentration profiles are presented. The correlation of the hole concentration and the amount of supplied Na is discussed in view of growth- and defect-related models.

Abstract: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells is an essential process in cancer progression. Cancer cells that undergone EMT loose cell–cell contacts, acquire mesenchymal properties and develop migratory and invasive abilities. In previous studies we have demonstrated that histamine may modify the invasive phenotype of pancreatic and mammary tumor cells. In this work we proposed to investigate whether histamine may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. The potential activation of normal CCD-1059Sk fibroblasts by histamine and EMT phenotypic changes induced in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells by the conditioned media (CM) derived from fibroblasts were evaluated. Initially, we determined the presence of H1, H2 and H4 histamine receptors and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) mRNA in CCD-1059Sk fibroblasts. MMP2 gelatinolytic activity, cell migration and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression were increased in fibroblasts by low doses (<1μM) and decreased by high doses (20μM) of histamine. MCF-7 cells cultured with CM from fibroblasts exhibited spindle-shaped morphology, cell spreading and cytoplasmic expression of β-catenin but there was no change in MMP2 activity and cell migration. MDA-MB-231 cells cultured with CM from fibroblasts showed a more elongated phenotype, cell spreading, cytoplasmic β-catenin, increased MMP2 activity and endogenous TGF-β1 expression, and enhanced cell migration and invasion. Notably, all these features were reversed when mammary tumor cells were cultured with CM from fibroblasts treated with 20μM histamine. In conclusion, high doses of histamine may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by fibroblasts CM.

Abstract: We propose that treating the surface of the bottom subcell active layer composed of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): indene-C60-bisadduct (ICBA) with 1-hexanol can improve the wettability of aqueous PEDOT:PSS on its top as a hole transport layer in the inverted tandem polymer solar cell (t-PSC), allowing a fabrication of large area device with power conversion efficiency (PCE) close to small area device. The device structure of the inverted t-PSC is ITO/ZnO(sol–gel)(30nm)/P3HT:ICBA(1:1, w/w) (180nm)/treatment with alcohol/PEDOT:PSS(80nm)/ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NP)(25nm)/Poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) (PTB7): PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w)(90nm) /MoO3(15nm)/Ag(100nm). For the small-area (0.02–0.03cm2) device, its PCE can be enhanced form 7.06% to 8.10% by treating with 1-hexanol on P3HT:ICBA surface, resulting from more efficient hole collection for the bottom subcell by the improved film formation of PEDOT:PSS. As the device area is enlarged to 1cm2, the PCE can be enhanced from 2.19% to 7.00% by the same alcohol treatment.

Abstract: Core–shell particles composed of a dielectric core and a metallic nanoshell exhibit tunable surface plasmons that may be exploited to enhance the light absorption capability of photoactive materials. This work uses both experimental and theoretical methods to elucidate the mechanism by which SiO2@Au@SiO2 (SGS) core–shell–shell particles improve the light harvesting efficiency of PbS–TiO2 heterojunction solar cells. The enhanced light absorption by PbS nanoparticles depends on their location in the device and their impact on device morphology. This study demonstrates that SGSs can promote the light harvesting of thin film solar cells in two ways. First, the localized surface plasmon resonance of the SGSs increases light scattering and the local electromagnetic field at the PbS–SGS interface. Second, placing SGSs between the PbS and TiO2 layers, forms nanodomes on top Au electrode and gives rise to additional light scattering that enhances the light harvesting efficiency. By combining these effects the short circuit current density and the energy conversion efficiency are increased by 29% and 24% respectively compared to a cell without SGSs.

Abstract: A new data logger using the Arduino open-source electronic platform was developed to solve the current problem of monitoring photovoltaic (PV) systems at low-cost, especially in remote areas or regions in developing countries. The data logger meets all of the relevant requirements in terms of accuracy included in the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards for PV systems, with a resolution of 18-bits, including 8 analogue inputs for measuring up to 8 PV modules and/or weather sensors, 3 inputs for low-cost analogue temperature sensors and virtually unlimited inputs for digital temperature sensors. The new data logger is completely autonomous, and the prototype has achieved an initial cost of only 60€. It was tested during a 6-month period under the harsh environmental conditions of the summer and winter in Southern Spain. The results using both the sensors and silicon reference cells indicate that the new system is reliable and exhibits comparable performance to commercial systems. This data logger is of special interest for both solar energy research and applications in developing countries, as it is both open-source and flexible. The data logger can be customised for the specific needs of each project at low-cost. The details of the specific design and its implementation are described.

Abstract: The power output and efficiency of a crystalline silicon PV module is a highly relevant quantity to evaluate novel cell, material and design technologies. It is therefore necessary to develop a full understanding of the different factors that impact the cell-to-module ratio. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate a unified methodology for predicting module power and efficiency from material and geometry data for several cell, interconnection and module designs. The methodology consists of analyzing photovoltaic inactive module areas, optical effects such as reflection, absorption and electrical losses. For a selection of efficiency impacting factors we show experimental results to demonstrate their influence on module efficiency and module power. The model has been validated by measurements on an H-patterned multi-crystalline 60-cell module showing a deviation in module power of only 1%, a value well within the flasher measurement uncertainty. For a 60-cell-module with pseudo-square monocrystalline solar cells with 19.9% efficiency we calculate absorption losses for different encapsulants in the range of 1.3 to 5.3W. The power gain for the investigated backside materials is found to be in the range between 4.5 and 6.7W.

Abstract: Three types of organic and hybrid photovoltaics, which include poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), [6, 6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and zinc oxide (ZnO) in their active layer as normal, inverted and hybrid solar cells, were prepared by fine-channel mist-spray coating in air. In particular, we investigated the donor/acceptor blending effect for increasing reproducibility in normal type, annealing temperature control for more effective ZnO layer in inverted type solar cells. Patterns of sparse and vertical distribution by solvent polarity were discussed in fabrication for hybrid solar cells. Consequently, enough blending of donor/acceptor solution, the combination of pre/post-heat treatment for ZnO layer and trade-off relation between crystallization of ZnO and ordering of the P3HT matrix were factors to be considered for enhanced results in terms of high photovoltaic performance.

Abstract: Lymphatic absorption is a highly regulated process driven by both an extrinsic mechanism (external force) and an intrinsic mechanism (lymphatic vessel contractility). The lymphatic muscle is a specialized smooth muscle with unique mechanical properties. To understand the molecular mechanism and relative contribution of smooth muscle contraction in lymphatic absorption, we analyzed mice with a smooth muscle-specific deletion of Mylk, a critical gene for smooth muscle contraction. Interestingly, the knockout mice were significantly resistant to anesthesia reagents. Upon injection in the feet with FITC-dextran, the mutant mice displayed a 2-fold delay of the absorption peak in the peripheral circulation. Examining the ear lymphatic vessels of the mutant mice revealed a reduction in the amount of fluid in the lumens of the lymphangions, suggesting an impairment of lymph formation. The Mylk-deficient lymphatic muscle exhibited a significant reduction of peristalsis and of myosin light chain phosphorylation in response to depolarization. We thus concluded that MLCK and myosin light chain phosphorylation are required for lymphatic vessel contraction. Lymphatic contractility is not an exclusive requirement for lymphatic absorption, and external force appears to be necessary for absorption.

Abstract: In skeletal muscle, autophagy is activated in multiple physiological and pathological conditions, notably through the transcriptional regulation of autophagy-related genes by FoxO3. However, recent evidence suggests that autophagy could also be regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms. The purpose of the study was therefore to determine the temporal regulation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional events involved in the control of autophagy during starvation (4h) and nutrient restoration (4h) in C2C12 myotubes. Starvation was associated with an activation of autophagy (decrease in mTOR activity, increase in AMPK activity and Ulk1 phosphorylation on Ser467), an increase in autophagy flux (increased LC3B-II/LC3B-I ratio, LC3B-II level and LC3B-positive punctate), and an increase in the content of autophagy-related proteins (Ulk1, Atg13, Vps34, and Atg5–Atg12 conjugate). Our data also indicated that the content of autophagy-related proteins was essentially maintained when nutrient sufficiency was restored. By contrast, mRNA level of Ulk1, Atg5, Bnip3, LC3B and Gabarapl1 did not increase in response to starvation. Accordingly, binding of FoxO3 transcription factor on LC3B promoter was only increased at the end of the starvation period, whereas mRNA levels of Atrogin1/MAFbx and MuRF1, two transcriptional targets of FoxO involved in ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, were markedly increased at this time. Together, these data provide evidence that target genes of FoxO3 are differentially regulated during starvation and that starvation of C2C12 myotubes is associated with a post-transcriptional regulation of autophagy.

Abstract: Boron doped hydrogenated multiphase silicon–carbon (multiphase silicon–carbon) film has been grown by a plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) method to obtain the properties of high conductivity and a low absorption coefficient. It consists of amorphous carbon, amorphous silicon and a crystalline silicon-like clustering phase. It has the advantage of reducing optical loss due to the wider band gap of amorphous carbon compared to amorphous silicon carbide. The film was fabricated in conditions of low power density with a high hydrogen flow rate to increase the ratio of the amorphous carbon. This result is able to be achieved because the reaction of Si-based and C-based radicals is suppressed by the deposition condition of low electron temperature (Te) of the plasma and the short residence time of the gases. The multiphase silicon–carbon showed high electrical conductivity and a low optical absorption coefficient in the short wavelength region. Applying it for use as a front contact layer in a Si thin film solar cell, it showed an improvement in the conversion efficiency due to the increase in the quantum efficiency in the short wavelength region.

Abstract: The outdoor application of antireflective (AR) films requires not only high transmittance but also such mechanical properties as good abrasion-resistance, certain humidity resistance to resist the damage of the harsh environment. In the study, AR films with excellent performance were prepared by the dip-coating process in which aqueous colloidal silica (ACS) was used as the silica source and orthophosphoric acid as adhesion promoting agent. In the process of heat treatment of the films, the orthophosphoric acid in silica sols firstly transformed into the chain of metaphosphoric acid by the polycondensation reactions and then reacted with surface Si–OH groups from colloidal silica particles and the substrate, resulting in the formation of the numerous Si–O–P cross-linkings and 3SiO2·2P2O5 phase. Because colloidal silica particles were coated with 3SiO2·2P2O5 phase and linked by strong Si–O–P chemical bonds, abrasion-resistant property of films was markedly boosted. When the weight ratio of H3PO4 to silica sols was 2.71%, the pencil hardness grade of corresponding film had reached 6 H. Meanwhile, the average transmittance of the film in the visible spectrum was 97.9% and the weighted average transmittance (WAT) in the full spectrum range was as high as 97.2%, while that of the bare glass substrate was merely 89.6%. Moreover, the average transmittance still remained at around 97.9% after having been soaked in tap water for 30 days.

Abstract: Incorporation of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in titania photoanode of dye sensitized solar cell (DSC) with hierarchical porous structure synthesized by controlled phase separation was studied. The hierarchical porous composite photoanode contained mesopores of 15nm and macropores of 280nm with surface roughness of about 15.4nm. The Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of CNTs beside titania anatase phase. Also, the transmission electron microscopy revealed that a very thin titania layer was formed on CNTs after impregnation with titania sol. The I–V characteristics of the DSCs with and without CNTs showed that incorporation of CNTs in photoanode led to an increase in current density and efficiency, which was due to the increase in surface area and hence dye adsorption, increase in density of states in titania and charge injection, and increase in charge collection and electron lifetime. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy exhibited lower series resistance, lower charge injection resistance, and higher electron lifetime in DSCs containing CNTs. Addition of CNTs in photoanode also affected the critical thickness of porous layer with which the maximum efficiency could be obtained. Furthermore, the open circuit voltage and fill factor of the DSCs was independent of thickness when TiO2/CNT composite was used. The optimum amount of CNTs was found to be 0.32wt%, which led to the short circuit current density of 10.12mA/cm2, open circuit voltage of 680mV, fill factor of 56%, and efficiency of 3.85%.

Abstract: Current losses at surfaces play a crucial role in the optimization of high-efficiency silicon solar cells. We present a new approach to characterize the surface recombination activity of interdigitated-back-contact (IBC) silicon solar cells by comparing experimental and simulated photoluminescence images (PL). The different recombination properties of the p- and n-doped regions of IBC cells in combination with the operating condition lead to contrast profiles in the PL image that vary with bias voltage. We achieve a good matching of experimental and simulated data for the investigated cells enabling the analysis of how sensitive the simulated contrast patterns are to changes in the surface recombination at the emitter, back- and front-surface-field and if a better matching of the experimental PL images is possible. Using these PL images in combination with simulations around the open circuit voltage Voc the determination of surface recombination velocities S and emitter saturation currents J0 on finished cells is made possible for the first time. This approach also opens a new path towards loss analysis of finished PERL, PERC, MWT and other silicon solar cells.

Abstract: We developed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) by slot-die coating a poly(3-hexylthiophene):fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) composites with various solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB), dichlorobenzene (DCB), or a CB/DCB co-solvent. To understand the effect of solvent on the uniform active layer film coating and charge carrier recombination, we characterized the coated films with UV–visible absorption spectroscopy, and analyzed the measured light intensity dependence of the cells׳ short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). The PSC with the active layer that was made with a CB/DCB co-solvent shows better uniform film quality and power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to its relatively small bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination. Finally, we successfully fabricated a uniform large-area PSC module from P3HT:PCBM with a CB/DCB co-solvent system, which shows a PCE of 1.73% under the condition of air mass 1.5.

Abstract: A moth-eye pattern made of silica (SiO2) nanoparticles mixed with MIBK (methyl isobutyl ketone) was fabricated on a glass substrate using a direct printing method. The patterned glass was annealed to improve hardness and a heptdecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl trichloro-silane based self-assembled monolayer (HDFS-SAM) was applied to the moth-eye pattern to reduce surface energy which improves hydrophobic properties. Compared to flat glass, the moth-eye patterned glass with a HDFS-SAM coating showed reduced reflectance, strong hardness, and high efficiency. As a result, the JSC of photovoltaic module was increased up to 1.9755mA/cm2 and efficiency was improved by 4.66% by the increased current density (JSC) of photovoltaic system, and the external quantum efficiency was enhanced over the entire visible spectrum.

In the current article, the method to prepare colorful cool gray coatings by mixing pairs of pigments of complementary colors and titanium dioxide rutile is introduced. The qualified cool light blue–gray and orange–gray coatings are created by mixing complementary cobalt aluminate blue and cromophtal yellow paste with the white coatings in appropriate proportions. The cool light to moderate yellow–gray and violet–gray coatings are formulated by blending complementary nickel titanate yellow and dioxazine purple paste and the white coatings in suitable proportions. The eligible cool light green–gray and red–gray coatings are colored with mixtures of complementary cobalt titanate green and irgazin red paste and the white coatings in appropriate proportions.

Abstract: Copper penetration through light-induced plated and electrolessly-plated nickel barrier layers into the underlying silicon of laser-doped selective-emitter (LDSE) silicon solar cells was investigated. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were employed for chemical identification of copper in silicon after thermal treatments at 200°C and 400°C. Copper precipitates were detected by TEM/EDX analysis in solar cells that were cooled rapidly by quenching in ethylene glycol, indicating that the nickel barrier layer may not completely prevent copper from diffusing into silicon. However, they were not detected in solar cells that were allowed to cool slowly under ambient laboratory conditions. The potential impact of copper ingression on the performance of LDSE solar cells was investigated by capturing open circuit photoluminescence images of the cells before and after heat treatments. Solar cells plated with an electroless nickel barrier layer showed more severe photoluminescence degradation after heat treatment followed by fast cooling, compared to cells plated with a nickel barrier formed by light-induced plating. The photoluminescence intensity of a solar cell with an electroless nickel barrier was partially recovered by a second heat treatment at 250°C followed by slow cooling under ambient laboratory conditions.

Abstract: Gangliosides play important roles in the development, differentiation and proliferation of mammalian cells. They bind to other cell membrane components through their terminal sialic acids. Different gangliosides influence cellular functions based on the positions and linkages of sialic acids. Expression of gangliosides mainly depends on the status of sialic acid-modulatory enzymes, such as different types of sialyltransferases and sialidases. One such sialyltransferase, disialoganglioside GD3 synthase, is specifically responsible for the production of GD3. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, making up more than 90% of pancreatic cancers, is a fatal malignancy with poor prognosis. Despite higher sialylation status, the disialoganglioside GD3 level is very low in this cancer. However, the exact status and function of this disialoganglioside is still unknown. Here, we intended to study the intracellular mechanism of disialoganglioside GD3-induced apoptosis and its correlation with the adhesion and angiogenic pathways in pancreatic cancer. We demonstrated that disialoganglioside GD3 synthase-transfected cells showed enhanced apoptosis and it caused the arrest of these cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle. Integrins, a family of transmembrane proteins play important role in cell–cell recognition, invasion, adhesion and migration. disialoganglioside GD3 co-localised with integrin-β1 and thereby inhibited it's downstream signalling in transfected cells. Transfected cells exhibited inhibition of cell adhesion with extracellular matrix proteins. Enhanced GD3 expression down regulated angiogenesis-regulatory proteins and inhibited epidermal growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor-driven angiogenic cell growth in these cells. Taken together, our study provides support for the GD3-induced cell cycle arrest, disruption of integrin-β1-mediated anchorage, inhibition of angiogenesis and thereby induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.

Abstract: Natural flake graphite was chemically intercalated to prepare expandable graphite. The expandable graphite was then expanded by means of microwave irradiation to obtain expanded graphite (EG). Tetradecanol (TD)/EG composite form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) were prepared by mixing TD with EG through an autoclave method. The highest loading of TD in the composite form-stable PCMs with good form-stability was 93wt%. The composite form-stable PCMs exhibited excellent thermal energy storage capacity. The melting enthalpy (ΔHm) and crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc) of the composite form-stable PCM containing 93wt% TD were 202.6 and 201.2J/g, respectively. However, the solid–solid phase transition of TD in the composite form-stable PCMs was hindered as TD was strongly absorbed by EG. As a result, the ΔHm and ΔHc of the composite form-stable PCMs were slightly lower than the theoretical value. The thermal conductivity of the composite form-stable PCMs was greatly enhanced by EG and was increased with the increasing of EG loading. The thermal conductivity of the composite form-stable PCM containing 7wt% EG attained 2.76W/mK. Besides, effects of the prepared EG on properties of the composite form-stable PCMs were compared with those of EG derived from commercially obtained expandable graphite.

Abstract: Sox2 overlapping transcript (Sox2ot) is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), localized on human chromosome 3q26.33, which is frequently amplified in lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, its roles in lung cancer remain under investigation. In this study, we found that Sox2ot was up-regulated over two folds in 53.01% of human primary lung cancers (44/83). The expression level of Sox2ot is significantly higher in SCCs than that in adenocarcinomas (ADCs) of the lung. Further study found high Sox2ot expression predicted poor survival in lung cancer patients (P=0.0053), implying Sox2ot is a novel prognostic factor. In two human lung cancer cell lines, HCC827 and SK-MES-1, knocking down Sox2ot inhibited cell proliferation by inducing G2/M arrest, with a concomitant decrease of cells in S phase. Reduced protein levels of Cyclin B1 and Cdc2 were also observed. Importantly, knocking down Sox2ot decreased EZH2 expression and reintroduction of EZH2 allowed Sox2ot knockdown cells progressed through G2/M phase, which correlates with the restoration of Cyclin B1 and Cdc2 expressions. Altogether, our data suggested that Sox2ot plays an important role in regulating lung cancer cell proliferation, and may represent a novel prognostic indicator for the disease.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) promise a low-cost alternative to traditional inorganic PV technology. Recently, the relatively poor efficiency of a bulk-heterojunction OPV has been improved considerably (>10%) in a tandem cell configuration, albeit at the expense of using four different organic materials. In this work, we revive the concept of ‘single-material tandem cells’ – originally developed in the 1990s to address the transport bottleneck of a-Si solar cell. We demonstrate that OPV sub-cells made of the single polymer (or organic semiconductor) and arranged in a series tandem configuration can lead to impressive (factor of 2–5) efficiency gains, provided that the sub-cells can be thinned for optimum carrier collection and stacked for improved light absorption. Our analysis may open up a new direction in OPV research and a completely different design space for such tandem structures.

Death receptor 3 mediates TNFSF15- and TNFα-induced endothelial cell apoptosis,

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor superfamily 15 (TNFSF15) suppresses angiogenesis by specifically inducing apoptosis in proliferating endothelial cells. Death receptor 3 (DR3), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF25), has been identified as a receptor for TNFSF15 to activate T cells. It is unclear, however, whether DR3 mediates TNFSF15 activity on endothelial cells. Here we show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of DR3 in an in vivo Matrigel angiogenesis assay, or in adult bovine aortic endothelial (ABAE) cell cultures, leads to resistance of endothelial cells to TNFSF15-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, DR3-depleted cells also exhibited markedly diminished responsiveness to TNFα cytotoxicity, even though DR3 is not a receptor for TNFα. Treatment of the cells with either TNFSF15 siRNA or a TNFSF15-neutralizing antibody, 4-3H, also results in a significant inhibition of TNFα-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, DR3 siRNA treatment gives rise to an increase of ERK1/2 MAPK activity, and up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins c-FLIP and Bcl-2, thus strengthening apoptosis-resisting potential in the cells. These findings indicate that DR3 mediates TNFSF15-induced endothelial cell apoptosis, and that up-regulation of TNFSF15 expression stimulated by TNFα is partly but significantly responsible for TNFα-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells.

LL-37 attenuates inflammatory impairment via mTOR signaling-dependent mitochondrial protection,

Abstract: The human cationic antimicrobial protein LL-37 is a multifunctional host defense peptide with a wide range of immunomodulatory activities. Previous work has shown that LL-37 exerts both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. The role of mitochondria in the skin inflammatory effects of LL-37 has not been well studied. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the immunomodulatory effect of LL-37 in HaCaT cells and to delineate the underlying mechanisms related to mitochondrial function. Immunohistochemistry results from tissue microarrays showed strong cytoplasmic LL-37 staining in inflammatory cells in chronic dermatic inflammation. Using exogenous LL-37 stimulation and LL-37 knockdown and overexpression, LL-37 was demonstrated to dramatically reduce the mRNA levels and protein secretion of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, IL-1α and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which are induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The anti-inflammatory effects of LL-37 are dependent upon its ability to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. Furthermore, we observed that LL-37 enhances the LPS-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin can neutralize the protective effects of LL-37 on mitochondria. In conclusion, these results suggest that high LL-37 expression levels correlate with chronic skin inflammation; mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in HaCaT cells during inflammation; and LL-37 attenuates inflammatory impairment by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis and protecting mitochondrial function, which are dependent upon mTOR signaling. These findings provide new insights into targeting mitochondria with LL-37 to prevent skin inflammatory reactions.

Abstract: In this article, we in situ fabricated copper sulfide (CuS) on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) substrate using a low temperature and low cost hydrothermal method and then organic solar cells (OSCs) were fabricated by using a thin layer of CuS film as hole transporting layer (HTL). Our CuS films, consisting of two-dimensional (2D) intersected hexagonal nanosheets, are stoichiometric and show p-type electrical conductivity, a good transparency and a high hole mobility. The Fermi level, valence and conduction band energies for CuS HTL are characterized in detail through photoelectron spectroscopy studies. The small energy barrier between the valance band of CuS and the HOMO of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the high hole mobility and electrical conductivity of CuS nanosheet film benefit for the hole transporting. Therefore, CuS HTL to OSCs results in a power conversion efficiency of 3.4% with P3HT and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the active layer, which is a 13.3% increase in performance than devices with a poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) HTL. Therefore, low-cost, environmental friendly and stable CuS is an appropriate choice for hole transporting materials (HTMs) in OSCs.

Abstract: Recently, n-type Si solar cells featuring a passivated rear contact, called TOPCon (Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact) were reported. The high conversion efficiency of 24.4% and very high FF>82% demonstrates that the efficiency potential of this full-area passivated rear contact is as good as or even better than that of partial rear contact (PRC) schemes like PERL (passivated emitter and rear locally diffused) and in addition avoids complex structuring steps and features a 1D carrier transport. Likewise, a boron-doped passivated rear contact for p-type solar cells (p-TOPCon) is proposed as an alternative to p-PRC cells. The optimum device design of PRC cells has to account for two opposing effects: a low-loss 3D carrier transport requires a high base doping but Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination within the base due to the formation of boron–oxygen complexes in standard Cz silicon calls for a low base doping level. This conflict might be overcome by p-TOPCon because its performance is less sensitive to base doping. This will be discussed on the base of experimental results. It is shown that its high implied fill factor (iFF) of 84% combined with the 1D carrier transport in the base translates into a higher FF potential. First investigations on planar solar cells prove the good performance of the p-TOPCon with respect to passivation and carrier transport. A Voc of 694mV and a FF of 81% underline the efficiency potential of this rear contact.

Abstract: We present a fast method to create interstitial oxygen concentration maps from resistivity calibrated photoluminescence images prior to and after a heat treatment at 450°C. The method utilizes the influence of thermal donors on the effective doping concentration of a sample. Although the determination of thermal donor concentrations from conductivity measurements is customary in literature, we found that implementation of a mobility model is necessary to determine accurate concentrations of thermal donors. Therefore an iterative correction algorithm is presented, which allows precise determination of thermal donor concentrations from resistivity measurements. The determination of interstitial oxygen concentrations from thermal donor concentrations is based on an updated parameterization based on a model of Wada et al. (Phys. Rev. B: Condens. Matter 30 (1984) 5884–5895) that is also presented in this paper. The method is demonstrated on a 1.3Ωcm p-type Czochralski grown silicon sample with an interstitial oxygen concentration in the range of 7.5×1017cm−3 and yields good agreement with FTIR measurements.

Abstract: Here, we report for the first time that electrodeposited CuSCN nanowires (NWs) could be successfully used as a new hole transporting layer (HTL) in a conventional polymer solar cell (PSC) with a poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCDTBT:PC70BM) blend as an active layer. An efficient PSC with 5.1% power conversion efficiency for 28mm2 active surface area is fabricated. The performances of the PSCs prepared with electrodeposited CuSCN thin films and nanowires are compared and the obtained results clearly show that the nanostructuring of the HTL leads to an efficient hole extraction. The influence of the HTL thickness on the device performances was studied and it has been found that the thickness of the CuSCN nanowire array should not exceed the active layer thickness in order to keep high performances. An extraordinary high open circuit voltage (>900mV) and a fill factor about 60% were measured. It is shown that the electrodeposited CuSCN thin films and NWs could be directly used in the polymer solar cells without any subsequent annealing process, which is a crucial point for the reduction of the device costs.

Abstract: The residual stress of mismatch seal between borosilicate glass 3.3 and stainless steel is analyzed for metal–glass solar evacuated tubes in this paper. As borosilicate glass has a much lower limit of stress than metal, a tube model with different sizes and shapes of metal and glass is simulated to determine the magnitude and profile of the residual stress in the glass region. The simulation results show that the maximum magnitude of the hazardous tensile stresses occurs at a few millimeters above the sealing area, not in the contact position; and the thickness of metal is the most important parameter of the seal which affects the stress level. The stress magnitude increases dramatically when the thickness of stainless steel increases from 10 to 60µm. Therefore, to avoid breakage of the seal, the thickness of metal should be less than 40µm. In addition, it is shown that both the cross-section shape of the metal ring and the contact length in the glass have a considerable impact on the stress. The stress level increases significantly with the increase of depth of the metal ring embedded in the glass. Comparison between a metal ring with trapezoidal cross-section and one with rectangular cross-section of equivalent mean thickness reveals that the former leads to smaller residual stress. Furthermore, the results show that variation in the glass tube dimensions, in compare to the metal ring parameters, has less effect on the residual stress level in the seal area. An increase in the thickness of the glass tube decreases the stress noticeably, whereas an increase in tube radius has a negligible impact. Finally, it is shown that the simulation results are in good accordance with results of experiments using samples of mismatch seal between borosilicate glass 3.3 and stainless steel successfully fabricated according to our proposed parameters.

Abstract: Photolithography is used as an alternative method to overcome the challenge of making anode and cathode contacts on a Si nanocrystal solar cell deposited on non-conductive substrates instead of reactive ion etching (RIE). The advantages of this method include better control of isolation mesa fabrication and the avoidance of device exposure to highly energetic particles which may cause unpredictable damage. The photovoltaic device fabricated shows an open-circuit voltage (VOC) and a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 270mV and 0.124mA/cm2 respectively at room temperature under one-sun illumination. Current–voltage measurements were performed at temperatures (T) from 77K to 300K. A model that includes recombination-generation current in the depletion region is considered to explain the observed current behaviour of the device. An ideality factor very close to 2 was calculated based on Suns-VOC measurement, which indicates that the device is limited by recombination in the depletion region. A discrepancy was observed between the peaks (1.47eV) in the photoluminescence spectrum and maximum VOC (0.81V) extrapolated from the VOC–T relation at 0K. This discrepancy has been attributed to the temperature dependence of the carrier lifetime in the depletion region characterized by an activation energy later defined in this article.

Abstract: An enhanced efficiency of ZnO/Cu2O inorganic nanostructure solar cells simply sensitized by CdS quantum dots (QDs) prepared by a chemical bath deposition method has been demonstrated. An appropriate coating of the CdS QDs on the ZnO nanorods leads to a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.53%, which is increased to more than three times compared with the reference device. And a maximum IPCE of 58.1% is obtained at 456nm with CdS QDs of 9 CBD cycles. The dramatically enhanced PCE is primary resulted from the improvement of the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current density, which is attributed to the formation of a cascade structure and increase of the absorbance by the CdS QDs coating. Our finding provides an effective method for the fabrication of the sensitized layer on ZnO, which can pave the way to further improve the efficiency of ZnO/Cu2O inorganic solar cells.

Abstract: Recombination active boron–oxygen related defects typically limit the efficiency of solar cells made from boron-doped, oxygen-rich silicon. This limitation can be overcome by applying a regeneration process that requires slightly elevated temperatures, carrier injection, and the presence of hydrogen in the silicon substrate in order to regenerate quickly and completely. The influence of mid-temperature steps up to 400°C on the regeneration kinetics is investigated and the results can be explained with the efficacy of the regeneration process depending on the hydrogen bonding states prior to regeneration. Boron-hydrogen pairs are found to be good candidates to be the relevant hydrogen source during regeneration. The long-term stability of the regenerated state is tested under solar cell operating conditions, and the thermal activation energy of its destabilization is determined to be 1.25±0.05eV. Limiting factors for high-speed regeneration processes are discussed, and a high temperature/high illumination procedure is presented, allowing complete regeneration in less than 10s. This makes regeneration feasible as an in-line process in solar cell production.

Abstract: Excessive accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen causes ER stress, which induces a set of genes, including those encoding ER-resident chaperones, to relieve the detrimental effects and recover homeostasis. Calreticulin is a chaperone that facilitates protein folding in the ER lumen, and its gene expression is induced by ER stress in Caenorhabditis elegans. Sumoylation conjugates small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins with target proteins to regulate a variety of biological processes, such as protein stability, nuclear transport, DNA binding, and gene expression. In this study, we showed that C. elegans X-box-binding protein 1 (Ce-XBP-1), an ER stress response transcription factor, interacts with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC-9 and a SUMOylation target. Our results indicated that abolishing sumoylation enhanced calreticulin expression in an XBP-1-dependent manner, and the resulting increase in calreticulin counteracted ER stress. Furthermore, sumoylation was repressed in C. elegans undergoing ER stress. Finally, RNAi against ubc-9 mainly affected the expression of genes associated with ER functions, such as lipid and organic acid metabolism. Our results suggest that sumoylation plays a regulatory role in ER function by controlling the expression of genes required for ER homeostasis in C. elegans.

The results are compared to the state of the art material P3HT. A clear angular dependence in the S-K NEXAFS spectra points to a preferred orientation of the π-conjugated system and thus to a high degree of ordering for most materials. Generally, the degree of ordering decreases after blending the polymer with the fullerene PCBM. In the case of P3HT and PCPDTBT, the degree of ordering could be improved considerably due to the annealing of the film. The annealing temperatures depend however on the considered polymer.

Abstract: Power frequency magnetic fields (PFMF) have been reported to affect several cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of PFMF on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) autophagy. After cells were exposed to 50Hz PFMF at 2mT for 0.5h, 2h, 6h, 12h, and 24h, we observed a significant increase in autophagic markers at 6h, including (i) higher microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II), (ii) the increased formation of GFP-LC3 puncta, and (iii) increased numbers of autophagic vacuoles under transmission electron microscope. Moreover, we provide convincing evidence using chloroquine (CQ) that the increase of autophagic markers was the result of enhanced autophagic flux and not the suppression of lysosomal function. In a search for molecular mechanisms underlying PFMF-mediated autophagy, we observe that the autophagic process involved reactive oxygen species (ROS) and was independent of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.

Abstract: In our previous study, we have found that the tumor multidrug resistance mediated by P-glycoprotein could be reversed by sustained intracellular acidification through down-regulating the multidrug resistance gene 1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein expression. However, the molecular events linking the intracellular acidification and the regulation of P-glycoprotein remain unclear. In the present study, the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of P-glycoprotein expression by the intracellular acidification were investigated. We found that the P-glycoprotein expression was down-regulated by the intracellular acidification through inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the resisitant K562/DOX cells. In the sensitive K562 and HL60 cell lines, the changes of the p38 MAPK expression after the acidification are not as obvious as that of K562/DOX cells, but the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is also observed, which indicates that the down-regulation of p38 MAPK by the intracellular acidification might be the resistant cell line specific. Blockade of ERK and JNK signaling by the inhibitors or RNA interference increased p38MAPK activities suggesting that cross-talk within MAPKs is also important for this response. Our study provides the first direct evidence that the reversal of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance by intracellular acidification is mediated by the crosstalk of MAPK signaling pathways.

Abstract: The goal of this work is to investigate selective hole contacts for crystalline silicon solar cells that are highly transparent, passivate the silicon surface and have low contact resistance. Stacks of Al2O3 and ZnO films are suggested for this purpose. The charge transport mechanism through these stacks is tunneling recombination and it is shown that such stacks can achieve a contact resistance of ∼1.5Ωcm2 for an Al2O3 thickness of 1nm. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the surface passivation of such stacks can be greatly improved by the insertion of a 3nm film of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) between the Al2O3 and the crystalline silicon, achieving an effective surface recombination velocity of ∼20cm/s. The stacks with an a-Si:H layer achieve a contact resistance of ∼5Ωcm2. Furthermore, from applying the theory of tunnel diodes to the charge transport through the contact, three important elements have been identified for the reduction of the contact resistance: the negative fixed charge density in the Al2O3; the doping concentration in the ZnO; and the dielectric properties of the Al2O3.

Abstract: We present ITO-free rigid and flexible monolithic organic solar cells with an active area of 25cm2. The devices employ a transparent insulator/metal/insulator anode consisting of a molybdenum oxide/silver/zinc sulfide stack that had a peak transmittance of 80% and a sheet resistance of 3.6Ω/□. Neutron reflectometry showed that zinc sulfide formed a more stable capping layer at the air interface than molybdenum oxide. It was found that blade coating could be used to form good quality large area films on both rigid (glass) and flexible [poly(ethylene terephthalate)] substrates with much reduced material consumption. Cells with an active layer comprised of a blend of poly[N-9″-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) gave a power conversion efficiency of 2.7%, which was 40% higher than a standard ITO-based device. No loss in efficiency was observed when a flexible substrate was used.

Abstract: Hypoxia is a recognized cause for solid tumors malignancy and resistance, probably via hypoxia-induced overexpression of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, major modulator of the cell response to oxygen deprivation. Although hyperoxia, the opposite condition, may represent a key issue to assess this paradigm, its effect on tumor growth and HIF-1α expression remains unclear. To test whether hyperoxia and hypoxia have divergent effects, and to better focus into the role of HIF-1α in vivo, athymic mice xenografted with LNCaP cells were exposed for 28 days to atmospheres containing 10, 21 or 30% O2. Whereas the xenografts grew twice faster in hypoxia, their growth rates in hyperoxia and normoxia were similar. To analyze the involved molecular mechanisms, we performed various assays in xenograft tissues. Faster xenografts growth in hypoxia was associated with higher phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and higher expression of Ki67, both related with pro-survival and cell proliferation pathways. By contrast, the expression level of HIF-1α was similar in normoxia and hypoxia, but paradoxically twice higher in hyperoxia. The protein level of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) was also higher in hyperoxia, suggesting marked cell response to redox imbalance. Whereas both the vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGF-R2 were overexpressed in hyperoxia, the tissue hemoglobin content was not increased, despite a slight reduction in vascularization. As a whole, this data indicates that the xenografts growth rate was independent of HIF-1α expression level, suggesting that in an in vivo setting alternative more effective proliferative paths associated with the cell response to the redox imbalance may override the paths linked to HIF-1α signaling.

Abstract: After several months of operation, many photovoltaic (PV) modules develop a discolouration defect called snail trails which appear as irregular dark traces across the cells. These traces are caused by silver nanoparticles accumulating within the encapsulation foil directly above the grid finger. In this work we systematically investigate combinations of encapsulation and back-sheet foils with respect to their susceptibility for snail trails. We can show that certain additive compositions within the encapsulation and back sheet foils are critical for the formation of the discolouring silver nanoparticles. We suggest a reaction model explaining the formation of snail trails from a chemical point of view. This fundamental understanding allows the rapid testing of foils for their snail trail sensitivity as well as the special design of resistant foils.

Abstract: The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is well known to induce differentiation of bone matrix-resorbing osteoclasts from hematopoietic stem cells. However, the impact of TNF on differentiation of bone matrix-forming osteoblasts from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) was only fragmentarily studied so far. Therefore, we investigated what impact long-term TNF treatment has on osteoblastic differentiation of MSC isolated from the adipose tissue (ASC) in vitro. In summary, we found continuous TNF exposure to induce the nuclear factor of kappa B pathway in ASC as well as secretion of the pro-inflammatory chemokine interleukin 8, but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase and the apoptosis pathway in ASC. Moreover, TNF neither induced nor inhibited osteoblastic differentiation of ASC, but strongly increased their proliferation rate. In that manner, pro-inflammatory conditions in vivo may generate significantly increased numbers of progenitor cells, and ASC especially, in conjunction with external stimuli, may contribute to the events of ectopic ossification observed in chronic inflammatory diseases. The substantiation of the translation of our in vitro findings to the disease context encourages further in vivo studies.

Abstract: The effects of different processing methods on the performance of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) for the hole extraction layer and printed metal layers were studied. Four different methods (hot plate, air oven, vacuum oven and far-infrared oven) were utilized to dry hole extraction layers formed from aqueous nano-particle dispersions. The far-infrared oven showed the best drying characteristics and the sheet resistance was 69Ω/□ in 240s. To sinter a screen printed silver electrode, six different methods (hot plate, air oven, vacuum oven, far-infrared oven, UV lamp and microwave oven) were employed. The microwave oven yielded the most effective sheet resistance drop, as low as 0.06Ω/□ in 20s when the power of the microwave oven was 400W. Using the fast processing methods developed in this study, the processing time can be reduced by about 40% without a loss in the performance of prepared devices.

Abstract: Neuropathic orofacial pain (NOP) exists in several forms including pathologies such as burning mouth syndrome (BMS), persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP), trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). BMS and PIFP are classically diagnosed by excluding other facial pain syndromes. TN and PHN are most often diagnosed based on a typical history and presenting pain characteristics. The pathophysiology of some of these conditions is still unclear and hence treatment options tend to vary and include a wide variety of treatments including cognitive behaviour therapy, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants and opioids; however such treatments often have limited efficacy with a great amount of inter-patient variability and poorly tolerated side effects. Analgesia is one the principal therapeutic targets of the cannabinoid system and many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of cannabinoid compounds in the treatment of neuropathic pain. This review will investigate the potential use of cannabinoids in the treatment of symptoms associated with NOP.

Abstract: Erythropoietin, discovered for its indispensable role during erythropoiesis, has been used in therapy for selected red blood cell disorders in erythropoietin-deficient patients. The biological activities of erythropoietin have been found in animal models to extend to non-erythroid tissues due to the expression of erythropoietin receptor. We previously demonstrated that erythropoietin promotes metabolic activity and white adipocytes browning to increase mitochondrial function and energy expenditure via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and Sirtuin1. Here we report that AMP-activated protein kinase was activated by erythropoietin possibly via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase in adipocytes as well as in white adipose tissue from diet induced obese mice. Erythropoietin increased cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide via increased AMP-activated protein kinase activity, possibly leading to Sirtuin1 activation. AMP-activated protein kinase knock down reduced erythropoietin mediated increase in cellular oxidative function including the increased oxygen consumption rate, fatty acid utilization and induction of key metabolic genes. Under hypoxia, adipocytes were found to generate more reactive oxygen species, and erythropoietin reduced the reactive oxygen species and increased antioxidant gene expression, suggesting that erythropoietin may provide protection from oxidative stress in adipocytes. Erythropoietin also reversed increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide by hypoxia via increased AMP-activated protein kinase. Additionally, AMP-activated protein kinase is found to be involved in erythropoietin stimulated increase in oxygen consumption rate, fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial gene expression. AMP-activated protein kinase knock down impaired erythropoietin stimulated increases in antioxidant gene expression. Collectively, our findings identify the AMP-activated protein kinase involvement in erythropoietin signaling in regulating adipocyte cellular redox status and metabolic activity.

Abstract: The relationship between the refractive index and the porosity of silica based anti-reflective coatings (ARCs) has been studied. The coatings were prepared with the traditional Stöber method. The refractive index was evaluated by fitting vis–NIR transmittance spectra to Fresnel׳s coefficient of reflection using the transfer matrix method. The porosity was assessed by a novel method based on image processing of high resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Results were compared to the commonly used Yoldas and Maxwell–Garnett mixing rules. Our results showed better agreement with the Yoldas mixing rule than with the Maxwell–Garnett mixing rule, which was explained as being due to the presence of elongated crack shaped pores in the ARCs rather than randomly dispersed spherical shaped pores, as was evident in the SEM images. Furthermore, we found that despite the presence of the elongated cracks, the coating appears to behave towards light like a homogenous medium. This somewhat surprising result calls for further research. Lastly, we have shown that it is reasonable to assume that the ARC is vertically homogeneous in terms of its porosity and effective refractive index.

Abstract: In this work we present a modified version of the commonly used semiconductor simulation program PC1D, named cmd-PC1D 6.0, which applies Fermi–Dirac (F–D) statistics, thus improving on the existing Boltzmann approximation that is employed in the original program. Several up-to-date models for crystalline Si have been implemented in the new program, including injection dependent band gap narrowing, carrier mobility and Auger recombination. The results obtained using cmd-PC1D 6.0 are verified against well-accepted and modern simulations tools for a range of both phosphorus- and boron-doped emitters with varying surface concentration. We find a good correspondence between the simulation results obtained with the different programs, with a deviation of less than 2fA/cm2 for the calculated emitter saturation current density using F–D statistics and less than 0.8 % relative deviation in all the main solar cell parameters under 1 sun illumination. By using the correct carrier statistics and the appropriate set of models it is now possible to avoid the commonly used effective models and adapted values, thus taking a large step in bringing PC1D further towards a more general, consistent and physically meaningful simulation tool for Si solar cells. The new program can be run from a command line or within a recently developed, powerful graphical user interface. Both cmd-PC1D 6.0 and the graphical user interface are freely available for download.

Abstract: Kidney fibrosis is a common feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD). A recent study suggests that abnormal Notch signaling activation contributes to the development of renal fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanism that regulates this process remains unexplored. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) or sham-operated C57BL6 mice (aged 10 weeks) were randomly assigned to receive dibenzazepine (DBZ, 250μg/100g/d) or vehicle for 7 days. Histologic examinations were performed on the kidneys using Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis were used for detection of mRNA expression and protein phosphorylation. The expression of Notch 1, 3, and 4, Notch intracellular domain (NICD), and its target genes Hes1 and HeyL were upregulated in UUO mice, while the increase in NICD protein was significantly attenuated by DBZ. After 7 days, the severity of renal fibrosis and expression of fibrotic markers, including collagen 1α1/3α1, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin, were markedly increased in UUO compared with sham mice. In contrast, administration of DBZ markedly attenuated these effects. Furthermore, DBZ significantly inhibited UUO-induced expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, phosphorylated Smad 2, and Smad 3. Mechanistically, Notch signaling activation in tubular epithelial cells enhanced fibroblast proliferation and activation in a coculture experiment. Our study provides evidence that Notch signaling is implicated in renal fibrogenesis. The Notch inhibitor DBZ can ameliorate this process via inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway, and might be a novel drug for preventing chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: In this work, the influence of type of supporting materials on the performance of form stable phase change materials (FSPCMs) was investigated. Two kinds of FSPCMs containing myristic acid (MA) were prepared using an inorganic material (bentonite) and a polymer (Eudragit L100) individually as the supporting material. The morphology, composition, crystalline properties, phase transition properties and heat storage/release performances of MA/bentonite FSPCMs (abbreviated as FSPCM-B) and MA/Eudragit L100 FSPCMs (abbreviated as FSPCM-E) were researched comparatively. The results show that the maximum MA content of FSPCM-B and FSPCM-E without melt MA leakage is 50wt% and 70wt%, respectively. All the prepared FSPCMs have good thermal reliability and reusability, and phase transition enthalpies of FSPCM-B are obviously lower than those of FSPCM-E with the same MA mass fraction. Due to the high thermal conductivity of bentonite, the heat transfer rate of FSPCM-B is exactly higher than that of FSPCM-E. This study will provide insights into the design and application of FSPCMs with inorganic matrix and polymeric matrix.

Abstract: A polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) thin film (9nm) prepared on the top of Al-doped ZnO (AZO) electron transport layer by spin-coating, was developed as an interface modifier in inverted polymer solar cells (IPSCs). The PVP with excellent alcohol solubility provided a strong adhesion and wettability, leading to an improved interface quality between the AZO and active layer. Combined with a reduced work function of the AZO layer, the resulting devices showed a significant increase in power conversion efficiency from 2.86% to 4.08%, benefiting from the dramatic enhancement in fill factor (35%). Due to the ease of use and remarkable boost in efficiency, our results indicated that PVP was a promising candidate for surface modification material in IPSCs.

Abstract: The strength and fracture behavior of solar cells govern the failure of cells in a photovoltaic module under thermal and mechanical loads. In this study, the testing and modeling of strength of silicon solar cells with aluminium metallization are presented. Therefore, the contribution of microstructure in solar cells was analyzed regarding stiffness and fracture behavior. With this knowledge, a simulation model was created to evaluate the influence of each layer to the stress field inside the silicon part of the solar cell. The model was used to evaluate 4-point bending experiments, which were performed to determine the strength of solar cells on front and backside and in two different directions, parallel and perpendicular to the busbars. It is shown that the strength and breakage depend strongly on the side and direction of loading. The lowest strength was detected for the backside being loaded with tensile stress parallel to the busbars.

Abstract: Influenza RNA polymerase is composed of three subunits, PA, PB1, and PB2, which interact with each other for transcription and replication of the viral RNA genome in the nucleus of infected cells. PB2 RNA-binding 627-domain (residues 535–693), located in the C-terminus, presents a highly basic surface around residue lysine 627 and has been proposed to interact with viral or cellular factors, resulting in host adaptation. However, the function of this domain is not yet characterized in detail. In this study, we identified RNA-binding activity and RNA-binding surfaces in both the N-terminal and basic C-terminal regions of PB2 627-domain using NMR experiments. Through mutagenesis studies, we confirmed which residues directly interact with RNA and mapped their locations on the RNA-binding surface. In addition, by luciferase activity assays, we showed that influenza virus polymerase activity may correlate with the interaction between PB2 and RNA. Representative host adaptive mutations (residues 591 and 627) were found to be located on the RNA-binding surface and were confirmed to directly interact with RNA and to affect polymerase activity. From these results, we suggest that influenza virus polymerase activity may be regulated through the interaction between PB2 627-domain and RNA and that consequently host adaptation of the virus may be influenced.

Abstract: Background
We previously demonstrated that dopamine (DA) overload may be a key mechanism behind development of minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) in rats. It has been shown that low-grade cerebral oedema and oxidative stress play important roles in the pathogenesis of MHE. In the current study, DA-triggered oxidative injury in cerebral cortex was studied.
Methods
An MHE rat model was used. DA was injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) into rats and added to primary cortical astrocytes (PCAs). Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and immunostaining were conducted after DA injection.
Results
Cognitive impairment and cerebral edema were observed in MHE rats and rats injected with 10μg DA. Astrocyte swelling was increased by DA. Astrocytic protein tyrosine nitration (PTN) was induced by DA. DA-induced PTN was insensitive to l-NMMA but was blunted by apocynin, superoxide dismutase, catalase and uric acid. Exposure to DA substantially increased levels of astrocytic NADPH oxidase subunits and induced p47phox phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species production but decreased the expression and activity of neuronal-type nitric oxide synthase (nNOS).
Conclusions
PTN induced by DA, which was attributed to NADPH oxidase and not to nNOS, may alter astrocyte function and thereby contribute to the precipitation of MHE episodes.

Abstract: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors control survival, proliferation and cytokine release in non-excitable cells. Previously we reported that α7 nicotinic receptors were present in the outer membranes of mouse liver mitochondria to regulate mitochondrial pore formation and cytochrome c release. Here we used a wide spectrum of nicotinic receptor subunit-specific antibodies to show that mitochondria express several nicotinic receptor subtypes in a tissue-specific manner: brain and liver mitochondria contain α7β2, α4β2 and less α3β2 nicotinic receptors, while mitochondria from the lung express preferentially α3β4 receptor subtype; all of them are non-covalently connected to voltage-dependent anion channels and control cytochrome c release. By using selective ligands of different nicotinic receptor subtypes (acetylcholine (1μM) or dihydro-β-erythroidine (1μM) for α4β2), conotoxin MII (1nM) for α3β2, MLA (50nM) for α7β2 and acetylcholine (10μM) for all subtypes) and apoptogenic agents triggering different mitochondrial signaling pathways (1μM wortmannin, 90μM Ca2+ or 0.5mM H2O2) it was found that α7β2 receptors affect mainly PI3K/Akt pathway, while α3β2 and α4β2 nAChRs also significantly influence CaKMII- and Src-dependent pathways. It is concluded that cholinergic regulation in mitochondria is realized through multiple nicotinic receptor subtypes, which control various pathways inducing mitochondrial type of apoptosis.

Abstract: 2′-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde inhibits breast cancer cell invasion. This study examined whether 2′-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, acting as a Michael acceptor, interferes with the ligand binding of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 to mediate breast cancer cell invasion. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, one of the direct molecular targets of 2′-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, is a multifunctional endocytic receptor. Changes in the thiol oxidation status of cell surface receptor proteins may function as a molecular switch, influencing ligand(s) binding. The oxidation status of extracellular cysteine thiol groups in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was examined using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter with thiol-specific fluorescent probes; Matrigel invasion and wound-healing assays were performed to determine the effects of 2′-hydroxycinnamaldehyde on in vitro cell migration. The molecular mechanisms by which 2′-hydroxycinnamaldehyde acts were evaluated by transient knockdown using siRNA or inhibition of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 by receptor-associated protein treatment. 2′-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde increased α-2-macroglobulin binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, which was alleviated by pretreatment of cells with N-acetylcystein. 2′-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde decreased the extracellular pepsin concentration significantly in a low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1- and α-2-macroglobulin-dependent manner. The anti-invasive effect of 2′-hydroxycinnamaldehyde was mitigated with receptor-associated protein pretreatment, suggesting that low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 is essential for the effects of 2′-hydroxycinnamaldehyde. From these data, we suggest that 2′-hydroxycinnamaldehyde increases the cysteine thiol oxidation status of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 extracellular domains, which results in α-2-macroglobulin ligand binding stimulation. Therefore, pepsin clearance in a low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1-α-2-macroglobulin-dependent manner might be an important molecular mechanism in 2′-hydroxycinnamaldehyde exerting its anti-invasive action on breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our data may provide an opportunity to promote the importance of the thiol oxidation status of cell surface receptor proteins for regulating cellular signaling pathways that are important in cancer progression.

Abstract: The transfer from lab scale to industrial application is one of the challenges for organic photovoltaics. For this, non halogenated formulations are a decisive need for the upscaling process, as are roll-to-toll (R2R) compatible methods. Devices processed with o-xylene using slot-die coating as a sheet-to-sheet technique show a reduced efficiency on a larger scale compared to lab scale solar cells. By using a mixture of high and low volatile solvents which selectively dissolve one component, the film homogeneity and the efficiency is dramatically improved. The slot-die coated active layers for solar cells processed from non-halogenated solvents show device efficiencies above 3% on flexible substrates.

Abstract: T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA1) is a DNA/RNA binding protein broadly expressed in eukaryotic cells, participating in multiple aspects of cellular metabolism. TIA1 phosphorylation was related with cell apoptosis and its RNA binding activity, however, the regulator and other functions of TIA1 phosphorylation were very little known. To find the modulator of TIA1 phosphorylation, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening and identified annexin A7 (ANXA7) as an interaction protein of TIA1. Recent study showed that a small molecule ABO could directly target ANXA7 and inhibit ANXA7 activity and its targets’ phosphorylation. As a GTPase, ANXA7 was speculated to modulate TIA1 phosphorylation. Our results showed that ABO treatment promoted the interaction between TIA1 and ANXA7, and then greatly inhibited phosphorylation of TIA1 in HUVECs. Further results showed that ABO-increased interaction between ANXA7 and TIA1 significantly promoted the processing of a pro-autophagic factor FLJ11812 and the expression of ATG13. Moreover, we found that ABO increased TIA1 protein level, co-localization of ANXA7 and TIA1, and ATG13 expression in the aortic endothelium of apoE−/− mice. These data highlighted the new role of TIA1 phosphorylation in autophagy.

Abstract: A key requirement for large-scale deployment of photovoltaic technologies is the development of highly functional materials with controllable opto-electronic properties. In this work, we report on the room-temperature synthesis of disordered alloys of the Earth-abundant, tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductors Cu2SnS3, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), and ZnS as (Cu2SnS3)1−x(ZnS)x. The resulting disordered semiconductors are found to have continuously and independently tunable optical and electronic properties. Quasi-isovalent alloying on the cation sublattice allows the optical band gap to be varied continuously from 1.1eV to 2.8eV. Aliovalent alloying leads to independent control of carrier concentration over at least three orders of magnitude. A conceptual framework describing these disordered materials is presented, in which the structural disorder, constrained by local tetrahedral coordination of both anions and cations, leads to the observed high degree of tunability of the opto-electronic properties. These materials are not only independently interesting, but the developed framework also applies to the opto-electronic properties of kesterite CZTS materials as well as provides a basis for the development of new semiconductors.

Abstract: The adsorption of the dye molecules onto TiO2 in a dye solution bath usually takes hours and is the rate-limiting step in rapid dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) fabrication. Here, we show that by high-speed dye solution droplet bombardments, TiO2 dye adsorption time reduces from hours to minutes. While 24-hr dye solution bath gives the cell with the efficiency of 4.62% (9mm×9mm), 9min dye adsorption time in the 1500rpm spinning disc system and 8.3min dye adsorption time in the 2000rpm spinning disc system give cells with efficiencies of 4.68% and 4.58%, respectively. The proposed method is ideal for rapid DSSC fabrication.

Abstract: Contact formation with silver (Ag) thick film pastes on boron emitters of n-type crystalline silicon (Si) solar cells is a nontrivial technological task. Low contact resistances are up to present only achieved with the addition of aluminium (Al) to the paste. During contact formation, Al assisted spiking from the paste into the silicon emitter and bulk occurs, thus leading to a low contact resistance but also to a deterioration of other cell parameters. Both effects are coupled and can be adjusted by choosing proper Al contents of the paste and temperatures for contact formation. In this work the microscopic electric properties of single spikes are presented. These microscopic results, i.e. alterations of the local emitter doping density, the pronounced local recombination activity at the interface between spikes and Si and its influence on the charge collection efficiency, are used to explain the observed dependencies of global cell parameters on the Al content of contact pastes.

Abstract: In this article, silicon nitride (SiNx) layers deposited on planar silicon wafers with two different doped areas (emitter: highly phosphorous doped and bulk: lightly boron doped) were locally irradiated by laser pulses. Our investigation is focused on the ablation mechanisms. For that purpose, an ultra-short laser source (pulse duration 0.3–12ps, wavelength 1025nm, Gaussian profile) was used. For high pulse durations and low fluences the SiNx layer is removed completely by lift-off. However, for lower pulse durations and higher fluences, the SiNx layer is not completely removed, due to direct ablation. By using an emitter, direct ablation of SiNx layers were observed also for higher pulse durations. Thus, the absorption process in the SiNx layer can be described as avalanche ionization with seed electrons from silicon.

Abstract: Molecular mechanisms that are associated with age-related denervation and loss of skeletal muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) are described for female C57Bl/6J mice aged 3, 15, 24, 27 and 29 months (m). Changes in mRNAs and proteins associated with myofibre denervation and protein metabolism in ageing muscles are reported, across the transition from healthy adult myofibres to sarcopenia that occurs between 15 and 24m. This onset of sarcopenia at 24m, corresponded with increased expression of genes associated with neuromuscular junction denervation including Chnrg, Chrnd, Ncam1, Runx1, Gadd45a and Myog. Sarcopenia in quadriceps muscles also coincided with increased protein levels for Igf1 receptor, Akt and ribosomal protein S6 (Rps6) with increased phosphorylation of Rps6 (Ser235/236) and elevated Murf1 mRNA and protein, but not Fbxo32: many of these changes are also linked to denervation. Global transcription profiling via microarray analysis confirmed these functional themes and highlighted additional themes that may be a consequence of pathology associated with sarcopenia, including changes in fatty acid metabolism, extracellular matrix structure and protein catabolism. Ageing was also associated with increased global gene expression variance, consistent with decreased control of gene regulation.

Abstract: The present study is demonstrating the deposition of solution based nanostructured silver top electrode for inverted organic solar cells. The deposition of silver nanoparticles through hybrid electrohydrodynamic atomization (Hybrid-EHDA) is discussed in detail. The film thicknesses were varied with respect to spray times. The interface between the metal electrode and organic film was investigated using a focused ion beam analyzer. The sheet resistance of nanostructured silver film was reduced by increasing the film thickness. The lowest sheet resistance of silver film is ~0.07Ω/sq with a film thickness of 2.6µm. The power conversion efficiency of fabricated devices was found to be influenced by the sheet resistance of silver film. The maximum power conversion efficiency (~2.44%) was observed at 0.07Ω/sq. Our results demonstrate that the Hybrid-EHDA will play a promising role in the fabrication of inverted organic solar cells using a solution based top electrode.

Abstract: In recent years, all the operating principles of intermediate band behaviour have been demonstrated in InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) solar cells. Having passed this hurdle, a new stage of research is underway, whose goal is to deliver QD solar cells with efficiencies above those of state-of-the-art single-gap devices. In this work, we demonstrate that this is possible, using the present InAs/GaAs QD system, if the QDs are made to be radiatively dominated, and if absorption enhancements are achieved by a combination of increasing the number of QDs and light trapping. A quantitative prediction is also made of the absorption enhancements required, suggesting that a 30 fold increase in the number of QDs and a light trapping enhancement of 10 are sufficient. Finally, insight is given into the relative merits of absorption enhancement via increasing QD numbers and via light trapping.

Abstract: Paraffin is a common phase-change-material (PCM) exploited in many thermal and solar energy storage applications. Its relatively large latent heat with a stable phase change, nontoxicity and noncorrosivity are the main reasons. Paraffin׳s low thermal conductivity may become a drawback for high power applications. In this study, the effect of adding nanomaterials to enhance paraffin׳s thermal performance is investigated. Nanomagnetite (Fe3O4) particles were prepared by sol–gel method for this investigation. Once characterization of nanomagnetite was done, it was added at 1%, 5%, 10%, and 15% ratios to paraffin (melting range: 46–48°C) to obtain a paraffin nanocomposite. Thermal characterization with Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) shows that the latent heat storage capacity of paraffin has been increased for 10% nanomagnetite composite, while the melting temperature range remained the same.

Abstract: 1, 8-Diiodooctane (DIO) has been known for its role of improving the polymer morphology and enhancing performance of polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell. In this work, the impedance spectroscopy was used to investigate the interface of poly(4,8-bis-alkyloxybenzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt- (alkyl thieno(3,4-b) thiophene-2-carboxylate)-2,6-diyl) (PBDTTT-C):PC70BM in BHJ with DIO as additive. Based on our results, we were able to simulate the device into an equivalent circuit model, which allows us to conveniently analyze the organic/organic interfacial contact in the organic photovoltaic (OPV) device. Thus, we demonstrate that the impedance spectroscopy can an effective approach in characterizing the donor/acceptor interfaces, such that a direct correlation can be established between the morphology and the device performance of BHJ devices.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to characterize the function of mitochondria and main energy fluxes in human colorectal cancer (HCC) cells. We have performed quantitative analysis of cellular respiration in post-operative tissue samples collected from 42 cancer patients. Permeabilized tumor tissue in combination with high resolution respirometry was used. Our results indicate that HCC is not a pure glycolytic tumor and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system may be the main provider of ATP in these tumor cells. The apparent Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) for ADP and maximal respiratory rate (Vm) values were calculated for the characterization of the affinity of mitochondria for exogenous ADP: normal colon tissue displayed low affinity (Km=260±55μM) whereas the affinity of tumor mitochondria was significantly higher (Km=126±17μM). But concurrently the Vm value of the tumor samples was 60–80% higher than that in control tissue. The reason for this change is related to the increased number of mitochondria. Our data suggest that in both HCC and normal intestinal cells tubulin β-II isoform probably does not play a role in the regulation of permeability of the MOM for adenine nucleotides. The mitochondrial creatine kinase energy transfer system is not functional in HCC and our experiments showed that adenylate kinase reactions could play an important role in the maintenance of energy homeostasis in colorectal carcinomas instead of creatine kinase. Immunofluorescent studies showed that hexokinase 2 (HK-2) was associated with mitochondria in HCC cells, but during carcinogenesis the total activity of HK did not change. Furthermore, only minor alterations in the expression of HK-1 and HK-2 isoforms have been observed. Metabolic Control analysis showed that the distribution of the control over electron transport chain and ATP synthasome complexes seemed to be similar in both tumor and control tissues. High flux control coefficients point to the possibility that the mitochondrial respiratory chain is reorganized in some way or assembled into large supercomplexes in both tissues.

Abstract: Low-cost upgraded metallurgical grade silicon (UMG-Si) with inherent boron (B) and phosphorus (P) compensation is a novel material for photovoltaic application. This paper presents the impact of solar irradiance intensity and temperature on the performance of compensated crystalline silicon solar cells. For the same rated output power, compensated crystalline silicon solar cells generate less electricity than the reference silicon solar cells at low irradiance intensity, owing to the strong injection dependence of the carrier lifetime due to high concentration of B–O complexes in compensated silicon. However, at high temperature, compensated crystalline silicon solar cells generate more electricity than the reference silicon solar cells, which mainly originates from the lower temperature-variation of the minority electron mobility in compensated silicon. It suggests that compensated silicon solar cells will be more appropriate for high irradiation application, which often contains high irradiance intensity and high temperature. These results are of great significance for understanding the actual outdoor performance of the solar cells based on the UMG-Si and their application in the photovoltaic (PV) industry.

Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate a light harvesting method to achieve efficient semitransparent polymer solar cells (STPSCs) based on PCDTBT: PC70BM by employing one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs) as reflector. The 1DPCs were constructed by N pairs of WO3/LiF, a pair means a combination of WO3 and LiF, including a layer of WO3 film and a layer of LiF film. By optimizing the number of pairs, a 1DPC with high reflectance region (400–500nm), which is exactly matched with the weak region of the (incident photon-to-electron conversion) IPCE spectrum of the reference STPSC is obtained. In contrast, the excellent STPSC with 8 pairs of 1DPC exhibited a high efficiency about 4.84% and hold an average transmittance of 25.4% in the visible range (400–700nm).

Abstract: Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) utilize an electrochemical proton gradient to accumulate peptides in the cytoplasm. Changing the highly conserved active-site Lys117 in the Escherichia coli POT YjdL to glutamine resulted in loss of ligand affinity as well as inability to distinguish between a dipeptide ligand and the corresponding dipeptide amide. The radically changed pHBulk profiles of Lys117Gln and Lys117Arg mutants indicate an important role of Lys117 in facilitating protonation of the transporter; a notion that is supported by the close proximity of Lys117 to the conserved ExxERFxYY POT motif previously shown to be involved in proton translocation. These results point toward a novel dual role of Lys117 in direct or indirect interaction with both proton and peptide.

Abstract: Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder characterized by the accumulation of glucosylceramide as a result of a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Several competitive glucocerebrosidase inhibitors are able to act as pharmacological chaperones for an efficient rescue of the mutated, misfolded forms of the enzyme. Along this line, we report in this work on the ability of several aminocyclitols to increase the residual glucocerebrosidase activity in patient fibroblasts with different genotypes. Some of the compounds were slightly active on fibroblasts bearing some mutations, including the highly prevalent N370S mutation. All compounds were highly active as enzyme activity enhancers on fibroblasts from Gaucher disease patients containing the G202R mutation. Moreover, using the novel tagged sphingolipid ω-azidosphingosine, a reduction in the tagged glucosylceramide accumulation was also observed for selected aminocyclitols. Attempts to explain the activity impairment observed in glucocerebrosidase bearing the G202R mutation by comparative molecular dynamic studies on wild type and the G202R mutated proteins (free and isofagomine-bound, in both cases) were unsuccessful. Under the simulation conditions used, no clear effect of the G202R mutation neither over the global structure of the protein nor on the loops that constitute the glucocerebrosidase active site was observed. Since the G202R residue is located on the protein surface, altered protein-membrane or protein-protein interactions could account for the observed differences. In conclusion, we have tested novel compounds that have shown some chaperone effect on particular glucocerebrosidase mutant enzymes, supporting the enhancement therapy as an alternative approach for Gaucher disease.

Abstract: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells with capacities to differentiate into the various cell types and hold great promise in regenerative medicine. The regulatory roles of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in osteoblast differentiation process have been increasingly recognized; however, little is known about the precise roles of HDAC8 in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Herein we aimed to investigate the roles of HDAC8 in the osteogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs by pharmacological and genetic manipulations in vitro. During osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, pharmacological inhibition of HDAC8 by HDAC inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) promoted the level of histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) and significantly enhanced the expression of osteogenesis-related genes Runx2, Osterix, osteocalcin (OCN), osteopontin (OPN) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Similarly, knockdown of HDAC8 using short interfering RNA triggered H3K9Ac and enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, largely phenocopied the effects of VPA-mediated HDAC8 depletion. However, enforced expression of HDAC8 significantly reduced the level of H3K9Ac and inhibited osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, which can be attenuated by VPA addition. Mechanistically, HDAC8 suppressed osteogenesis-related genes expression by removing the acetylation of histone H3K9, thus leading to transcriptional inhibition during osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Importantly, we found that HDAC8 physically associated with Runx2 to repress its transcriptional activity and this association decreased when BMSCs underwent osteogenic differentiation. Taken together, these results indicate that epigenetic regulation of Runx2 by HDAC8-mediated histone H3K9 acetylation is required for the proper osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.

Abstract: The carrier recombination dynamics of InGaAsP material with a bandgap energy of 1eV for quadruple-junction solar cells grown by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy have been investigated by the employment of time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurement. For the nominally undoped material, the PL decay time increases with increasing temperature, which indicates that radiative recombination dominates the recombination process. The radiative and the nonradiative recombination time constants were calculated on the basis of the temperature-dependent PL decay time and the integrated PL intensity. With the incorporation of Be (as the p-type dopant) into the material, the PL decay time decreases with increasing temperature, and a double-exponential PL decay curve is observed in the case of the material with a higher doping density. An InGaAsP-based single-junction photovoltaic device with a bandgap of 1eV was fabricated, and an efficiency of 16.4% was obtained under the AM1.5G solar spectra.

Abstract: In order to improve the reliability of solar cell solder joints, rare earth Eu was selected as the additive into SnAgCu solders; the properties and microstructure of SnAgCu–xEu were studied systematically. The results indicated that the addition of Eu can improve the solderability, mechanical properties, creep resistance, and thermal fatigue reliability. The optimum content of Eu is 0.04wt%; the creep rupture life can be increased up to 8.5 times, and the thermal fatigue life is 37.4% higher than original SnAgCu solders. However, excessive content of Eu addition can deteriorate the properties. And the rare earth Eu can refine the microstructure matrix, and reduce the size of β-Sn.

Abstract: Expanded graphite (EG) powder as a typical porous material has high thermal conductivity and large surface area that are often used to enhance the thermal conductivity of phase change materials (PCMs). Ten composites of paraffin/EG powder with various weight fractions were elaborated by high pressure compression. Their microstructure configuration and thermal properties were characterized with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Thermal Constant Analyzer. The saturation sorption capacity of EG under compression was experimentally determined. The thermal conductivity of the paraffin/EG composite is greatly enhanced by 41 times in maximum as compared to pure paraffin. Based on the experimental quantification, we propose a novel two-level scale model from micro-scale to macro-scale to compute the thermal conductivity of the composite. The numerical results agree well with the experimental data that validate the precision and reliability of the proposed model. Furthermore, the results reveal that both keeping porous EG structure at original morphology and increasing the saturated sorption capacity of paraffin in EG could eventually improve the heat transfer capacity of the composites. In addition, the proposed model would require more experimental validation based on the composites with different materials in future work.

Abstract: This study is focused on the preparation, characterization and determination of latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) properties of polystyrene (PS)/n-heptadecane micro/nano-capsules as a novel encapsulated phase change material (EPCM). The micro/nano-EPCM was synthesized via emulsion polymerization method and characterized chemically using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The surface morphology and particle size of the micro/nano-capsules were investigated by particle size distribution (PSD) analysis, polarized optical microscopy (POM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. From differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, the melting temperature and latent heat of the prepared EPCM were measured as 21.48°C and 136.89J/g, respectively. The results of thermogravimetric (TG) analysis showed that the fabricated micro/nano-EPCM had good thermal durability. Thermal reliability, chemical stability, thermal conductivity and phase change reversibility of the micro/nano-EPCM were also studied. All of the results revealed that the fabricated PS/n-heptadecane micro/nano-capsules had promising LHTES potential especially for passive solar thermal regulation of textile, building, food storage container, medical and electronic materials.

Abstract: This work reports on the syntheses of copper-gallium bimetallic nanoparticles by ultrasound-assisted chemical reduction method in alcohol solutions to prepare CuGaS2 thin films. Gallium metal (Ga) in the form of pellet was dispersed in tetraethylene glycol by ultrasonic treatment. The chemical reduction of copper sulfate (CuSO4) into copper metal by NaBH4 at the surface of the Ga droplets enabled the formation of Ga–Cu core–shell structure. The Ga droplets with submicrometer size were homogenously coated with ~40-nm Cu nanoparticles. The exothermic transition of the Ga–Cu core–shell nanocomposite materials occurred at 485°C, which corresponds to the crystalline phase formation of γ-Cu9Ga4. Ga–Cu nanocomposites with a 1:1 ratio were deposited onto molybdenum substrate via electrophoretic deposition method as a precursor of CuGaS2, a p-type semiconductor. Mechanical pressing and sulfurization provided dense CuGaS2 thin films with good crystallinity and high phase purity.

Abstract: Dyslipemia has a direct impact on cardiac remodeling by altering extracellular matrix (ECM) components. One of the main ECM components is elastin, a proteic three-dimensional network that can be efficiently degraded by cysteine proteases or cathepsins. Dyslipemic status in insulin resistance and combined hyperlipoproteinemia diseases include raised levels of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), triglyceride (TG)-cholesteryl ester (CE)-rich lipoproteins. Enhanced VLDL concentration promotes cardiomyocyte intracellular cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation in a LRP1-dependent manner. The aim of this work was to analyze the effect of cardiomyocyte intracellular CE accumulation on tropoelastin (TE) characteristics and to investigate the role of LRP1 and cathepsin S (CatS) on these effects. Molecular studies showed that LRP1 deficiency impaired CE selective uptake and accumulation from TG-CE-rich lipoproteins (VLDL+IDL) and CE-rich lipoproteins (aggregated LDL, agLDL). Biochemical and confocal microscopic studies showed that LRP1-mediated intracellular CE accumulation increased CatS mature protein levels and induced an altered intracellular TE globule structure. Biophysical studies evidenced that LRP1-mediated intracellular CE accumulation caused a significant drop of Tg2 glass transition temperature of cardiomyocyte secreted TE. Moreover, CatS deficiency prevented the alterations in TE intracellular globule structure and on TE glass transition temperature. These results demonstrate that LRP1-mediated cardiomyocyte intracellular CE accumulation alters the structural and physical characteristics of secreted TE through an increase in CatS mature protein levels. Therefore, the modulation of LRP1-mediated intracellular CE accumulation in cardiomyocytes could impact pathological ventricular remodeling associated with insulin-resistance and combined hyperlipoproteinemia, pathologies characterized by enhanced concentrations of TG-CE-rich lipoproteins.

Abstract: Porous SiO2 thin films with low reflectance and high transmittance were obtained using reactive high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS) at a high working pressure of 6.67Pa (50mTorr). The average transmittance (450–600nm) of the SiO2 thin films was 94.45%. In comparison, SiO2 thin films deposited at a low working pressure of 0.27Pa (2mTorr) showed an average transmittance of 91.26%. The improvement in the transmittance was attributed to the lower refractive index resulting from the porous structure of the SiO2 thin films. To examine the effect of the anti-reflection SiO2 coating, an a-Si:H solar cell was produced on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. The initial energy conversion efficiency for cells using the anti-reflection, SiO2-coated FTO glass was 11.75%, higher than the 10.75% for the sample using the bare FTO glass. The increase in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) due to the decreased light reflectance was the largest contributor to the increase in the a-Si:H solar cell efficiency.

Abstract: Crystalline silicon remains (all variants included) the dominant technology to manufacture solar cells. Currently (2012–2013) more than 90% of all solar cells produced are based on this vast group of technologies. The availability, the cost and the quality to the silicon feedstock is therefore a strategic issue of paramount importance for the entire photovoltaic sector. The silicon demand/supply balance has evolved from a situation of shortage with rocketing sales prices, in the years 2005–2008, to currently (2012–2013) an oversupply situation with record low price level for virgin polysilicon. Between these two extreme periods, production capacity has been multiplied by a factor of nearly 10. A better understanding of the prevailing dynamics in the polysilicon/silicon industry is needed in order for all players in the solar cell industry to make proper planning. In light of the past developments as well as the constraints imposed by a sound competition, the present article reviews the market trends for solar grade silicon including capacity, supply, demand and price. Furthermore, the article reviews the competing commercial technologies i.e. Siemens polysilicon, fluidized bed reactor/FBR polysilicon and upgraded metallurgical/UMG silicon and compares them in terms of maturity, improvement potential, product morphology, purity, applications and cost (actual vs. potential).

Abstract: Bone resorption by osteoclasts requires the release of secretory lysosomes containing cathepsin K, which degrades the organic bone matrix. The activity of this secretory function is determined by the level of lipidation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Although the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β increases osteoclast activity, the underlying mechanism(s) remains undefined. In our present study, we found that IL-1β accelerates the release of cathepsin K from osteoclast precursors by increasing the cleavage and lipidation of LC3 and the subsequent formation of lipid-bound LC3-II containing secretory lysosomes. IL-1β increased LC3-II formation within osteoclast precursors through a process that is dependent on increases in the intracellular Ca2+ levels. In addition, IL-1β was found to act synergistically with RANKL to increase ERK activation in a Ca2+-dependent manner. More importantly, Atg7-deficient osteoclast precursors, which showed impaired lipidation of LC3-I, did not exhibit IL-1β-mediated increases in cathepsin K secretion. Thus, IL-1β promotes LC3-II formation through the Ca2+-dependent activation of ERK, which triggers the release of cathepsin K. These findings provide evidence for a molecular mechanism through which IL-1β enhances the secretory function of osteoclast precursors.

Abstract: Vasotab TY is a KGD (Lys-Gly-Asp)-containing peptide identified from salivary glands of the horsefly of Tabanus yao. We have previously reported that vasotab TY showed a strong vasodilator activity. In the present study, vasotab TY was found to inhibit platelet aggregation effectively. It completely inhibited platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at the concentration of 9.6μg/ml. Vasotab TY significantly reduced thrombus weight in rat arteriovenous shunt model and inhibited thrombosis in carrageenan-induced mouse tail thrombosis model in vivo. Vasotab TY competitively bound to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) with eptifibatide, a well-known KGD-containing cyclic heptapeptide containing high specificity and high affinity for GPIIb/IIIa, suggesting that it is an antagonist of the fibrinogen receptor GPIIb/IIIa on the surface of platelet. The KGD motif in vasotab TY may facilitate the binding of it to GPIIb/IIIa. Vasotab TY showed a half-life of more than 1h in vivo. It showed little side effects including little bleeding, no hemolytic activity on human blood red cells and no cytotoxicity on human keratinocyte and THP-1 cells. Combined its vasodilator and platelet inhibitory functions, vasotab TY might be an excellent candidate for the development of clinical anti-thrombosis medicines.

Abstract: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer is a major clinical problem in chemotherapy of cancer patients. We have noted inappropriate PKCδ hypomethylation and overexpression of genes in the PKCδ/AP-1 pathway in the human uterus sarcoma drug-resistant cell line, MES-SA/Dx5 cells, which also overexpress p-glycoprotein (ABCB1). Recent studies have indicated that FZD1 is overexpressed in both multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines and in clinical tumor samples. These data have led us to hypothesize that the FZD1-mediated PKCδ signal-transduction pathway may play an important role in drug resistance in MES-SA/Dx5 cells. In this work, the PKCδ inhibitor Rottlerin was found to reduce ABCB1 expression and to inhibit the MDR drug pumping ability in the MES-SA/Dx5 cells when compared with the doxorubicin-sensitive parental cell line, MES-SA. PKCδ was up-regulated with concurrent up-regulation of the mRNA levels of the AP-1-related factors, c-JUN and c-FOS. Activation of AP-1 also correlated with up-regulation of the AP-1 downstream genes HGF and EGR1. Furthermore, AP-1 activities were reduced and the AP-1 downstream genes were down-regulated in Rottlerin-treated or PKCδ shRNA-transfected cells. MES-SA/Dx5 cells were resensitized to doxorubicin-induced toxicity by co-treatment with doxorubicin and Rottlerin or PKCδ shRNA. In addition, cell viability and drug pump-out ability were significantly reduced in the FZD1 inhibitor curcumin-treated and FZD1 shRNA-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells, indicating involvement of PKCδ in FZD1-modulated ABCB1 expression pathway. Taken together, our data demonstrate that FZD1 regulates PKCδ, and the PKCδ/AP-1 signalling transduction pathway plays an important role in drug resistance in MES-SA/Dx5 cells.
