Abstract: Summary
Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are maintained in a special microenvironment called a niche. However, much is unknown about components that constitute the niche. Here, we report that Cdc42 is essential for germline niche development. Sertoli cell-specific Cdc42-deficient mice showed normal premeiotic spermatogenesis. However, germ cells gradually disappeared during haploid cell formation and few germ cells remained in the mature testes. Spermatogonial transplantation experiments revealed a significant loss of SSCs in Cdc42-deficient testes. Moreover, Cdc42 deficiency in Sertoli cells downregulated GDNF, a critical factor for SSC maintenance. Cdc42-deficient Sertoli cells also exhibited lower nuclear MAPK1/3 staining. Inhibition of MAP2K1 or depletion of Pea15a scaffold protein downregulated GDNF expression. A screen of transcription factors revealed that Cdc42-deficient Sertoli cells downregulate DMRT1 and SOX9, both of which are critical for Sertoli cell development. These results indicate that Cdc42 is essential for niche function via MAPK1/3-dependent GDNF secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota regulates obesity through metabolite-host interactions. However, the mechanisms underlying such interactions have been unclear. Here, we found that intestinal hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) positively regulates gut lactate by controlling the expression of intestinal Ldha. Intestine-specific HIF-2α ablation in mice resulted in lower lactate levels, and less Bacteroides vulgatus and greater Ruminococcus torques abundance, respectively. Together, these changes resulted in elevated taurine-conjugated cholic acid (TCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) levels and activation of the adipose G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor, GPBAR1 (TGR5). This activation upregulated expression of uncoupling protein (UCP) 1 and mitochondrial creatine kinase (CKMT) 2, resulting in elevation of white adipose tissue thermogenesis. Administration of TCA and DCA mirrored these phenotypes, and colonization with B. vulgatus and R. torques inhibited and induced thermogenesis, respectively. This work deepens our understanding of how host genes regulate the microbiome and provides novel strategies for alleviating obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Humoral immunity relies on the efficient differentiation of memory B cells (MBCs) into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). T helper (Th) signals upregulate B cell receptor (BCR) signaling by potentiating Src family kinases through increasing CD45 phosphatase activity (CD45 PA). In this study, we show that high CD45 PA in MBCs enhances BCR signaling and is essential for their effective ASC differentiation. Mechanistically, Th signals upregulate CD45 PA through intensifying the surface binding of a CD45 ligand, Galectin-1. CD45 PA works as a sensor of T cell help and defines high-affinity germinal center (GC) plasma cell (PC) precursors characterized by IRF4 expression in vivo. Increasing T cell help in vitro results in an incremental CD45 PA increase and enhances ASC differentiation by facilitating effective induction of the transcription factors IRF4 and BLIMP1. This study connects Th signals with BCR signaling through Galectin-1-dependent regulation of CD45 PA and provides a mechanism for efficient ASC differentiation of MBCs.

Abstract: Summary
Phenotypic variation is a fundamental prerequisite for cell and organism evolution by natural selection. Whereas the role of stochastic gene expression in phenotypic diversity of genetically identical cells is well studied, not much is known regarding the relationship between stochastic gene expression and individual behavioral variation in animals. We demonstrate that a specific miRNA (miR-466f-3p) is upregulated in the hippocampus of a portion of individual inbred mice upon a Morris water maze task. Significantly, miR-466f-3p positively regulates the neuron morphology, function and spatial learning, and memory capability of mice. Mechanistically, miR-466f-3p represses translation of MEF2A, a negative regulator of learning/memory. Finally, we show that varied upregulation of hippocampal miR-466f-3p results from randomized phosphorylation of hippocampal cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding (CREB) in individuals. This finding of modulation of spatial learning and memory via a randomized hippocampal signaling axis upon neuronal stimulation represents a demonstration of how variation in tissue gene expression lead to varied animal behavior.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to efficiently and dynamically change information stored in genomes would enable powerful strategies for studying cell biology and controlling cellular phenotypes. Current recombineering-mediated DNA writing platforms in bacteria are limited to specific laboratory conditions, often suffer from suboptimal editing efficiencies, and are not suitable for in situ applications. To overcome these limitations, we engineered a retroelement-mediated DNA writing system that enables efficient and precise editing of bacterial genomes without the requirement for target-specific elements or selection. We demonstrate that this DNA writing platform enables a broad range of applications, including efficient, scarless, and cis-element-independent editing of targeted microbial genomes within complex communities, the high-throughput mapping of spatial information and cellular interactions into DNA memory, and the continuous evolution of cellular traits.

Abstract: Summary
The sterile inflammation caused by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) worsens the prognosis following primary injury such as ischemic stroke. However, there are no effective treatments to regulate DAMPs. Here, we report that AIM (or CD5L) protein reduces sterile inflammation by attenuating DAMPs and that AIM administration ameliorates the deleterious effects of ischemic stroke. AIM binds to DAMPs via charge-based interactions and disulfide bond formation. This AIM association promotes the phagocytic removal of DAMPs and neutralizes DAMPs by impeding their binding to inflammatory receptors. In experimental stroke, AIM-deficient mice exhibit severe neurological damage and higher mortality with greater levels of DAMPs and associated inflammation in the brain than wild-type mice, in which brain AIM levels increase following stroke onset. Recombinant AIM administration reduces sterile inflammation in the infarcted region, leading to a profound reduction of animal mortality. Our findings provide a basis for the therapies targeting DAMPs to improve ischemic stroke.

Abstract: Cardiac hypertrophic signaling cascades resulting in heart failure diseases are mediated by protein phosphorylation. Recent developments in mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics have led to the identification of thousands of differentially phosphorylated proteins and their phosphorylation sites. However, functional studies of these differentially phosphorylated proteins have not been conducted in a large-scale or high-throughput manner due to a lack of methods capable of revealing the functional relevance of each phosphorylation site. In this study, an integrated approach combining quantitative phosphoproteomics and cell-based functional screening using phosphorylation competition peptides was developed. A pathological cardiac hypertrophy model, junctate-1 transgenic mice and control mice, were analyzed using label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify differentially phosphorylated proteins and sites. A cell-based functional assay system measuring hypertrophic cell growth of neonatal rat ventricle cardiomyocytes (NRVMs) following phenylephrine treatment was applied, and changes in phosphorylation of individual differentially phosphorylated sites were induced by incorporation of phosphorylation competition peptides conjugated with cell-penetrating peptides. Cell-based functional screening against 18 selected phosphorylation sites identified three phosphorylation sites (Ser-98, Ser-179 of Ldb3, and Ser-1146 of palladin) displaying near-complete inhibition of cardiac hypertrophic growth of NRVMs. Changes in phosphorylation levels of Ser-98 and Ser-179 in Ldb3 were further confirmed in NRVMs and other pathological/physiological hypertrophy models, including transverse aortic constriction and swimming models, using site-specific phospho-antibodies. Our integrated approach can be used to identify functionally important phosphorylation sites among differentially phosphorylated sites, and unlike conventional approaches, it is easily applicable for large-scale and/or high-throughput analyses.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors harbor defined regulatory intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which raises the question of how they mediate binding to structured co-regulators and modulate their activity. Here, we present a detailed molecular regulatory mechanism of Forkhead box O4 (FOXO4) by the structured transcriptional co-regulator β-catenin. We find that the disordered FOXO4 C-terminal region, which contains its transactivation domain, binds β-catenin through two defined interaction sites, and this is regulated by combined PKB/AKT- and CK1-mediated phosphorylation. Binding of β-catenin competes with the autoinhibitory interaction of the FOXO4 disordered region with its DNA-binding Forkhead domain, and thereby enhances FOXO4 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we show that binding of the β-catenin inhibitor protein ICAT is compatible with FOXO4 binding to β-catenin, suggesting that ICAT acts as a molecular switch between anti-proliferative FOXO and pro-proliferative Wnt/TCF/LEF signaling. These data illustrate how the interplay of IDRs, post-translational modifications, and co-factor binding contribute to transcription factor function.

Abstract: Summary
β5t is a cortical thymic epithelial cell (cTEC)-specific component of the thymoproteasome, which is essential for the optimal production of functionally competent CD8+ T cells. Our recent analysis showed a specific impact of β5t on proteasome subunit composition in cTECs, supporting the possibility that the thymoproteasome optimizes CD8+ T cell development through the production of MHC-I-associated unique self-peptides in cTECs. However, a recent article reports that β5t regulates the expression of hundreds of cTEC genes and affects both CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes by causing oxidative stress in thymocytes. The authors further analyze our published data and describe that they confirm their conclusions. Here, we examine the issues that they raise and conclude that, rather than regulating hundreds of genes in cTECs, β5t has a highly specific impact in cTECs on proteasome subunit composition. This Matters Arising Response article addresses the Apavaloaei et al. (2021) Matters Arising paper, published concurrently in Cell Reports.

Abstract: Summary
The chloroplast is the main organelle for stress-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, how chloroplastic ROS homeostasis is maintained under salt stress is largely unknown. We show that EGY3, a gene encoding a chloroplast-localized protein, is induced by salt and oxidative stresses. The loss of EGY3 function causes stress hypersensitivity while EGY3 overexpression increases the tolerance to both salt and chloroplastic oxidative stresses. EGY3 interacts with chloroplastic Cu/Zn-SOD2 (CSD2) and promotes CSD2 stability under stress conditions. In egy3-1 mutant plants, the stress-induced CSD2 degradation limits H2O2 production in chloroplasts and impairs H2O2-mediated retrograde signaling, as indicated by the decreased expression of retrograde-signal-responsive genes required for stress tolerance. Both exogenous application of H2O2 (or APX inhibitor) and CSD2 overexpression can rescue the salt-stress hypersensitivity of egy3-1 mutants. Our findings reveal that EGY3 enhances the tolerance to salt stress by promoting the CSD2 stability and H2O2-mediated chloroplastic retrograde signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The transformed state in acute leukemia requires gene regulatory programs involving transcription factors and chromatin modulators. Here, we uncover an IRF8-MEF2D transcriptional circuit as an acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-biased dependency. We discover and characterize the mechanism by which the chromatin “reader” ZMYND8 directly activates IRF8 in parallel with the MYC proto-oncogene through their lineage-specific enhancers. ZMYND8 is essential for AML proliferation in vitro and in vivo and associates with MYC and IRF8 enhancer elements that we define in cell lines and in patient samples. ZMYND8 occupancy at IRF8 and MYC enhancers requires BRD4, a transcription coactivator also necessary for AML proliferation. We show that ZMYND8 binds to the ET domain of BRD4 via its chromatin reader cassette, which in turn is required for proper chromatin occupancy and maintenance of leukemic growth in vivo. Our results rationalize ZMYND8 as a potential therapeutic target for modulating essential transcriptional programs in AML.

Abstract: Summary
Genetically diverse mouse populations are powerful tools for characterizing the regulation of the proteome and its relationship to whole-organism phenotypes. We used mass spectrometry to profile and quantify the abundance of 6,798 proteins in liver tissue from mice of both sexes across 58 Collaborative Cross (CC) inbred strains. We previously collected liver proteomics data from the related Diversity Outbred (DO) mice and their founder strains. We show concordance across the proteomics datasets despite being generated from separate experiments, allowing comparative analysis. We map protein abundance quantitative trait loci (pQTLs), identifying 1,087 local and 285 distal in the CC mice and 1,706 local and 414 distal in the DO mice. We find that regulatory effects on individual proteins are conserved across the mouse populations, in particular for local genetic variation and sex differences. In comparison, proteins that form complexes are often co-regulated, displaying varying genetic architectures, and overall show lower heritability and map fewer pQTLs. We have made this resource publicly available to enable quantitative analyses of the regulation of the proteome.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of function of adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-1 (ADAR1) causes the severe autoinflammatory disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). ADAR1 converts adenosines into inosines within dsRNA. This process called A-to-I editing masks self-dsRNA from detection by the antiviral dsRNA sensor MDA5. ADAR1 binds to dsRNA in both the canonical A-form and the poorly defined Z conformation (Z-RNA). Mutations in the Z-RNA-binding Zα domain of ADAR1 are common in patients with AGS. How loss of ADAR1/Z-RNA interaction contributes to disease development is unknown. We demonstrate that abrogated binding of ADAR1 to Z-RNA leads to reduced A-to-I editing of dsRNA structures formed by base pairing of inversely oriented short interspersed nuclear elements. Preventing ADAR1 binding to Z-RNA triggers an MDA5/MAVS-mediated type I interferon response and leads to the development of lethal autoinflammation in mice. This shows that the interaction between ADAR1 and Z-RNA restricts sensing of self-dsRNA and prevents AGS development.

Abstract: Summary
Unrelated individuals can produce genetically similar clones of antibodies, known as public clonotypes, which have been seen in responses to different infectious diseases, as well as healthy individuals. Here we identify 37 public clonotypes in memory B cells from convalescent survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or in plasmablasts from an individual after vaccination with mRNA-encoded spike protein. We identify 29 public clonotypes, including clones recognizing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein S1 subunit (including a neutralizing, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2]-blocking clone that protects in vivo) and others recognizing non-RBD epitopes that bind the S2 domain. Germline-revertant forms of some public clonotypes bind efficiently to spike protein, suggesting these common germline-encoded antibodies are preconfigured for avid recognition. Identification of large numbers of public clonotypes provides insight into the molecular basis of efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and sheds light on the immune pressures driving the selection of common viral escape mutants.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 variants that attenuate antibody neutralization could jeopardize vaccine efficacy. We recently reported the protective activity of an intranasally administered spike protein-based chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in animals, which has advanced to human trials. Here, we assessed its durability, dose response, and cross-protective activity in mice. A single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induced durably high neutralizing and Fc effector antibody responses in serum and S-specific IgG and IgA secreting long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow. Protection against a historical SARS-CoV-2 strain was observed across a 100-fold vaccine dose range and over a 200-day period. At 6 weeks or 9 months after vaccination, serum antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 strains with B.1.351, B.1.1.28, and B.1.617.1 spike proteins and conferred almost complete protection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts after challenge with variant viruses. Thus, in mice, intranasal immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S provides durable protection against historical and emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Abstract: With the recent developments in deep learning, automatic cell segmentation from images of microscopic examination slides seems to be a solved problem as recent methods have achieved comparable results on existing benchmark datasets. However, most of the existing cell segmentation benchmark datasets either contain a single cell type, few instances of the cells, not publicly available. Therefore, it is unclear whether the performance improvements can generalize on more diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a large and diverse cell segmentation dataset BBBC041Seg11https://github.com/Deponker/Blood-cell-segmentation-dataset, which consists both of uninfected cells (i.e., red blood cells/RBCs, leukocytes) and infected cells (i.e., gametocytes, rings, trophozoites, and schizonts). Additionally, all cell types do not have equal instances, which encourages researchers to develop algorithms for learning from imbalanced classes in a few shot learning paradigm. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative study using both classical rule-based and recent deep learning state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for automatic cell segmentation and provide them as strong baselines. We believe the introduction of BBBC041Seg will promote future research towards clinically applicable cell segmentation methods from microscopic examinations, which can be later used for downstream tasks such as detecting hematological diseases (i.e., malaria).

Abstract: Puerarin regulates the osteoblast differentiation of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. This study, hereby, explored the effects of puerarin on the osteogenic differentiation of dental follicle cells (DFCs) for the first time. Rat DFCs (rDFCs) were isolated and identified. After the rDFCs were treated by Puerarin and cultured in osteogenic induction medium, the viability, osteogenic differentiation, and the activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and nitric oxide (NO) were detected. Besides, the secretion of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and expressions of collagen I, osteocalcin (OC), osteopontin (OPN), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC), and protein kinase G 1 (PKG-1) were further determined or quantified. Puerarin enhanced the viability and osteogenic differentiation, and increased the activities of ALP, NO, and cGMP and the expressions of Collagen I, OC, OPN, RUNX2, SGC, and PKG-1 in rDFCs. After the co-treatment with puerarin and L-NMMA (NO synthase inhibitor), the promotive effects of Puerarin on cell viability, osteogenic differentiation, and the expressions of collagen I, OC, OPN, RUNX2, SGC, and PKG-1 in rDFCs were reversed by L-NMMA. Puerarin boosted the osteogenic differentiation of rDFCs by activating the NO pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Despite wide use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy for many solid cancers, most individuals become resistant to this therapy, leading to disease progression. Therefore, new biomarkers and strategies for blocking adaptive resistance of cancer to anti-VEGF therapy are needed. As described here, we demonstrate that cancer-derived small extracellular vesicles package increasing quantities of VEGF and other factors in response to anti-VEGF therapy. The packaging process of VEGF into small extracellular vesicles (EVs) is mediated by the tetraspanin CD63. Furthermore, small EV-VEGF (eVEGF) is not accessible to anti-VEGF antibodies and can trigger intracrine VEGF signaling in endothelial cells. eVEGF promotes angiogenesis and enhances tumor growth despite bevacizumab treatment. These data demonstrate a mechanism where VEGF is partitioned into small EVs and promotes tumor angiogenesis and progression. These findings have clinical implications for biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Summary
PRMT5 is an essential arginine methyltransferase and a therapeutic target in MTAP-null cancers. PRMT5 uses adaptor proteins for substrate recruitment through a previously undefined mechanism. Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved peptide sequence shared among the three known substrate adaptors (CLNS1A, RIOK1, and COPR5) and show that it is necessary and sufficient for interaction with PRMT5. We demonstrate that PRMT5 uses modular adaptor proteins containing a common binding motif for substrate recruitment, comparable with other enzyme classes such as kinases and E3 ligases. We structurally resolve the interface with PRMT5 and show via genetic perturbation that it is required for methylation of adaptor-recruited substrates including the spliceosome, histones, and ribosomal complexes. Furthermore, disruption of this site affects Sm spliceosome activity, leading to intron retention. Genetic disruption of the PRMT5-substrate adaptor interface impairs growth of MTAP-null tumor cells and is thus a site for development of therapeutic inhibitors of PRMT5.

Abstract: Summary
The inappropriate use of antibiotics is a severe public health problem worldwide, contributing to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. To explore the possible impacts of the inappropriate use of antibiotics on the immune system, we use Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) infection as an example and show that imipenem increases the mortality of mice infected by MDR K. pneumoniae. Further studies demonstrate that imipenem enhances the secretion of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) with significantly elevated presentation of GroEL, which promotes the phagocytosis of OMVs by macrophages that depends on the interaction between GroEL and its receptor, lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1). OMVs cause the pyroptosis of macrophages and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which contribute to exacerbated inflammatory responses. We propose that the inappropriate use of antibiotics in the cases of infection by MDR bacteria such as K. pneumoniae might cause damaging inflammatory responses, which underlines the pernicious effects of inappropriate use of antibiotics.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer tissue often comprises multiple tumor clones with distinct oncogenic alterations such as Ras or Src activation, yet the mechanism by which tumor heterogeneity drives cancer progression remains elusive. Here, we show in Drosophila imaginal epithelium that clones of Ras- or Src-activated benign tumors interact with each other to mutually promote tumor malignancy. Mechanistically, Ras-activated cells upregulate the cell-surface ligand Delta while Src-activated cells upregulate its receptor Notch, leading to Notch activation in Src cells. Elevated Notch signaling induces the transcriptional repressor Zfh1/ZEB1, which downregulates E-cadherin and cell death gene hid, leading to Src-activated invasive tumors. Simultaneously, Notch activation in Src cells upregulates the cytokine Unpaired/IL-6, which activates JAK-STAT signaling in neighboring Ras cells. Elevated JAK-STAT signaling upregulates the BTB-zinc-finger protein Chinmo, which downregulates E-cadherin and thus generates Ras-activated invasive tumors. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how tumor heterogeneity triggers tumor progression via cell-cell interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Studies suggest that the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy is influenced by intestinal bacteria. However, the influence of the microbiome on radiation therapy is not as well understood, and the microbiome comprises more than bacteria. Here, we find that intestinal fungi regulate antitumor immune responses following radiation in mouse models of breast cancer and melanoma and that fungi and bacteria have opposite influences on these responses. Antibiotic-mediated depletion or gnotobiotic exclusion of fungi enhances responsiveness to radiation, whereas antibiotic-mediated depletion of bacteria reduces responsiveness and is associated with overgrowth of commensal fungi. Further, elevated intratumoral expression of Dectin-1, a primary innate sensor of fungi, is negatively associated with survival in patients with breast cancer and is required for the effects of commensal fungi in mouse models of radiation therapy.

Abstract: Compartment boundaries prevent cell mixing during animal development. In the early Drosophila embryo, the mesectoderm is a group of glial precursors that separate ectoderm and mesoderm, forming the ventral midline. Mesectoderm cells undergo one round of oriented divisions during axis elongation and are eventually internalized 6 h later. Using spinning disk confocal microscopy and image analysis, we found that after dividing, mesectoderm cells reversed their planar polarity. The polarity factor Bazooka was redistributed to mesectoderm-mesectoderm cell interfaces, and the molecular motor non-muscle Myosin II and its upstream activator Rho-kinase (Rok) accumulated at mesectoderm-ectoderm (ME) interfaces, forming supracellular cables flanking the mesectoderm on either side of the tissue. Laser ablation revealed the presence of increased tension at ME cables, where Myosin was stabilized, as shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. We used laser nanosurgery to reduce tension at the ME boundary, and we found that Myosin fluorescence decreased rapidly, suggesting a role for tension in ME boundary maintenance. Mathematical modelling predicted that increased tension at the ME boundary was necessary to prevent the premature establishment of contacts between the two ectodermal sheets on opposite sides of the mesectoderm, thus controlling the timing of mesectoderm internalization. We validated the model in vivo: Myosin inhibition disrupted the linearity of the ME boundary and resulted in early internalization of the mesectoderm. Our results suggest that the redistribution of Rok polarizes Myosin and Bazooka within the mesectoderm to establish tissue boundaries, and that ME boundaries control the timely internalization of the mesectoderm as embryos develop.

Abstract: Summary
Establishing the embryonic body plan of multicellular organisms relies on precisely orchestrated cell divisions coupled with pattern formation, which, in animals, are regulated by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. The conserved Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) mediates H3K27 trimethylation and comes in different flavors in Arabidopsis. The PRC2 catalytic subunit MEDEA is required for seed development; however, a role for PRC2 in embryonic patterning has been dismissed. Here, we demonstrate that embryos derived from medea eggs abort because MEDEA is required for patterning and cell lineage determination in the early embryo. Similar to PcG proteins in mammals, MEDEA regulates embryonic patterning and growth by controlling cell-cycle progression through repression of CYCD1;1, which encodes a core cell-cycle component. Thus, Arabidopsis embryogenesis is epigenetically regulated by PcG proteins, revealing that the PRC2-dependent modulation of cell-cycle progression was independently recruited to control embryonic cell proliferation and patterning in animals and plants.

Abstract: Summary
Temperature is a variable component of the environment, and all organisms must deal with or adapt to temperature change. Acute temperature change activates cellular stress responses, resulting in refolding or removal of damaged proteins. However, how organisms adapt to long-term temperature change remains largely unexplored. Here we report that budding yeast responds to long-term high temperature challenge by switching from chaperone induction to reduction of temperature-sensitive proteins and re-localizing a portion of its proteome. Surprisingly, we also find that many proteins adopt an alternative conformation. Using Fet3p as an example, we find that the temperature-dependent conformational difference is accompanied by distinct thermostability, subcellular localization, and, importantly, cellular functions. We postulate that, in addition to the known mechanisms of adaptation, conformational plasticity allows some polypeptides to acquire new biophysical properties and functions when environmental change endures.

Abstract: Summary
Plant-based dietary patterns are associated with improved cardiometabolic health, but causal dietary components are unclear. Protein has been proposed to play a role, but the importance of protein quantity versus quality remains unknown. We investigated the contributions of total protein amount, amino acid (AA) composition, and plant versus animal source. Analysis of total protein and AA composition of food items and dietary patterns revealed differences between individual food items, but few differences between AA profiles of vegan versus omnivorous dietary patterns. Effects of protein quantity, but not quality, on cardiometabolic health markers were observed in mice using semi-purified diets with crystalline AAs in plant versus animal-based ratios and naturally sourced diets with whole-food ingredients. Our data show relatively little difference in protein quality between plant-based and omnivorous dietary patterns and that reduced total protein intake in plant-based dietary patterns may be a contributor to the benefits of plant-based diets.

Abstract: Summary
The immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome is largely unknown, especially for non-structural proteins and accessory proteins. In this study, we collect 2,360 COVID-19 sera and 601 control sera. We analyze these sera on a protein microarray with 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, building an antibody response landscape for immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM. Non-structural proteins and accessory proteins NSP1, NSP7, NSP8, RdRp, ORF3b, and ORF9b elicit prevalent IgG responses. The IgG patterns and dynamics of non-structural/accessory proteins are different from those of the S and N proteins. The IgG responses against these six proteins are associated with disease severity and clinical outcome, and they decline sharply about 20 days after symptom onset. In non-survivors, a sharp decrease of IgG antibodies against S1 and N proteins before death is observed. The global antibody responses to non-structural/accessory proteins revealed here may facilitate a deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunology.

Abstract: Summary
Control of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is endangered by the emergence of viral variants with increased transmission efficiency, resistance to marketed therapeutic antibodies, and reduced sensitivity to vaccine-induced immunity. Here, we screen B cells from COVID-19 donors and identify P5C3, a highly potent and broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody with picomolar neutralizing activity against all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) identified to date. Structural characterization of P5C3 Fab in complex with the spike demonstrates a neutralizing activity defined by a large buried surface area, highly overlapping with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) surface necessary for ACE2 interaction. We further demonstrate that P5C3 shows complete prophylactic protection in the SARS-CoV-2-infected hamster challenge model. These results indicate that P5C3 opens exciting perspectives either as a prophylactic agent in immunocompromised individuals with poor response to vaccination or as combination therapy in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic targeting with subcellular specificity is essential for neural circuit assembly. Developing neurons use mechanisms to curb promiscuous synaptic connections and to direct synapse formation to defined subcellular compartments. How this selectivity is achieved molecularly remains enigmatic. Here, we discover a link between mRNA poly(A)-tailing and axon collateral branch-specific synaptic connectivity within the CNS. We reveal that the RNA-binding protein Musashi binds to the mRNA encoding the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptp69D, thereby increasing poly(A) tail length and Ptp69D protein levels. This regulation specifically promotes synaptic connectivity in one axon collateral characterized by a high degree of arborization and strong synaptogenic potential. In a different compartment of the same axon, Musashi prevents ectopic synaptogenesis, revealing antagonistic, compartment-specific functions. Moreover, Musashi-dependent Ptp69D regulation controls synaptic connectivity in the olfactory circuit. Thus, Musashi differentially shapes synaptic connectivity at the level of individual subcellular compartments and within different developmental and neuron type-specific contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Ionizing radiation-induced DNA damages cause genome instability and are highly cytotoxic. Deoxyribonucleotide metabolism provides building blocks for DNA repair. Nevertheless, how deoxyribonucleotide metabolism is timely regulated to coordinate with DNA repair remains elusive. Here, we show that ionizing radiation results in TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS)1/2 at T228, thereby enhancing PRPS1/2 catalytic activity and promoting deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. DNA damage-elicited activation of cGAS/STING axis and ATM-mediated PRPS1/2 S16 phosphorylation are required for PRPS1/2 T228 phosphorylation under ionizing radiation. Furthermore, T228 phosphorylation overrides allosteric regulator-mediated effects and preserves PRPS1/2 with high activity. The expression of non-phosphorylatable PRPS1/2 mutants or inhibition of cGAS/STING axis counteracts ionizing radiation-induced PRPS1/2 activation, deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, and DNA repair, and further impairs cell viability. This study highlights a novel and important mechanism underlying an innate immune response-guided deoxyribonucleotide metabolism, which supports DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
Although axonal damage induces rapid changes in gene expression in primary sensory neurons, it remains unclear how this process is initiated. The transcription factor ATF3, one of the earliest genes responding to nerve injury, regulates expression of downstream genes that enable axon regeneration. By exploiting ATF3 reporter systems, we identify topoisomerase inhibitors as ATF3 inducers, including camptothecin. Camptothecin increases ATF3 expression and promotes neurite outgrowth in sensory neurons in vitro and enhances axonal regeneration after sciatic nerve crush in vivo. Given the action of topoisomerases in producing DNA breaks, we determine that they do occur immediately after nerve damage at the ATF3 gene locus in injured sensory neurons and are further increased after camptothecin exposure. Formation of DNA breaks in injured sensory neurons and enhancement of it pharmacologically may contribute to the initiation of those transcriptional changes required for peripheral nerve regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Correct positioning of T cells within infected tissues is critical for T cell activation and pathogen control. Upon tissue entry, effector T cells must efficiently locate antigen-presenting cells (APC) for peripheral activation. We reveal that tissue entry and initial peripheral activation of Th1 effector T cells are tightly linked to perivascular positioning of chemokine-expressing APCs. Dermal inflammation induces tissue-wide de novo generation of discrete perivascular CXCL10+ cell clusters, enriched for CD11c+MHC-II+ monocyte-derived dendritic cells. These chemokine clusters are “hotspots” for both Th1 extravasation and activation in the inflamed skin. CXCR3-dependent Th1 localization to the cluster micro-environment prolongs T-APC interactions and boosts function. Both the frequency and range of these clusters are enhanced via a T helper 1 (Th1)-intrinsic, interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-dependent positive-feedback loop. Thus, the perivascular CXCL10+ clusters act as initial peripheral activation niches, optimizing controlled activation broadly throughout the tissue by coupling Th1 tissue entry with enhanced opportunities for Th1-APC encounter.

Abstract: Summary
Actinins are strain-sensing actin cross-linkers that are ubiquitously expressed and harbor mutations in human diseases. We utilize CRISPR, pluripotent stem cells, and BioID to study actinin interactomes in human cardiomyocytes. We identify 324 actinin proximity partners, including those that are dependent on sarcomere assembly. We confirm 19 known interactors and identify a network of RNA-binding proteins, including those with RNA localization functions. In vivo and biochemical interaction studies support that IGF2BP2 localizes electron transport chain transcripts to actinin neighborhoods through interactions between its K homology (KH) domain and actinin’s rod domain. We combine alanine scanning mutagenesis and metabolic assays to disrupt and functionally interrogate actinin-IGF2BP2 interactions, which reveal an essential role in metabolic responses to pathological sarcomere activation using a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy model. This study expands our functional knowledge of actinin, uncovers sarcomere interaction partners, and reveals sarcomere crosstalk with IGF2BP2 for metabolic adaptation relevant to human disease.

Abstract: Summary
Anopheles mosquitoes are the sole vectors of malaria. Although adult females are directly responsible for disease transmission and accordingly have been extensively studied, the survival of pre-adult larval stages is vital. Mosquito larvae utilize a spectrum of chemosensory and other cues to navigate their aquatic habitats to avoid predators and search for food. Here we examine larval olfactory responses, in which the peripheral components are associated with the antennal sensory cone. Larval behavior and sensory cone responses to volatile stimuli in Anopheles coluzzii demonstrate the sensory cone is particularly tuned to alcohols, thiazoles, and heterocyclics, and these responses can be assigned to discrete groups of sensory cone neurons with distinctive profiles. These studies reveal that the anopheline larvae actively sample volatile odors above their aquatic habitats via a highly sophisticated olfactory system that is sensitive to a broad range of compounds with significant behavioral relevance.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian cell cytoskeletal reorganization for efficient directional movement requires tight coordination of actomyosin and microtubule networks. In this study, we show that LRAP35a potentiates microtubule stabilization by promoting CLASP2/EB1 interaction besides its complex formation with MRCK/MYO18A for retrograde actin flow. The alternate regulation of these two networks by LRAP35a is tightly regulated by a series of phosphorylation events that dictated its specificity. Sequential phosphorylation of LRAP35a by Protein Kinase A (PKA) and Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β (GSK3β) initiates the association of LRAP35a with CLASP2, while subsequent binding and further phosphorylation by Casein Kinase 1δ (CK1δ) induce their dissociation, which facilitates LRAP35a/MRCK association in driving lamellar actomyosin flow. Importantly, microtubule dynamics is directly moderated by CK1δ activity on CLASP2 to regulate GSK3β phosphorylation of the SxIP motifs that blocks EB1 binding, an event countered by LRAP35a interaction and its competition for CK1δ activity. Overall this study reveals an essential role for LRAP35a in coordinating lamellar contractility and microtubule polarization in cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Skin is one of the most common sites of host immune response against Staphylococcus aureus infection. Here, through a combination of in vitro assays, mouse models, and intravital imaging, we find that S. aureus immune evasion in skin is controlled by a cascade composed of the ArlRS two-component regulatory system and its downstream effector, MgrA. S. aureus lacking either ArlRS or MgrA is less virulent and unable to form correct abscess structure due to de-repression of a giant surface protein, Ebh. These S. aureus mutants also have decreased expression of immune evasion factors (leukocidins, chemotaxis-inhibitory protein of S. aureus [CHIPS], staphylococcal complement inhibitor [SCIN], and nuclease) and are unable to kill neutrophils, block their chemotaxis, degrade neutrophil extracellular traps, and survive direct neutrophil attack. The combination of disrupted abscess structure and reduced immune evasion factors makes S. aureus susceptible to host defenses. ArlRS and MgrA are therefore the main regulators of S. aureus immune evasion and promising treatment targets.

Abstract: Summary
In glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent and lethal brain tumor, therapies suppressing recurrently altered signaling pathways failed to extend survival. However, in patient subsets, specific genetic lesions can confer sensitivity to targeted agents. By exploiting an integrated model based on patient-derived stem-like cells, faithfully recapitulating the original GBMs in vitro and in vivo, here, we identify a human GBM subset (∼9% of all GBMs) characterized by ERBB3 overexpression and nuclear accumulation. ERBB3 overexpression is driven by inheritable promoter methylation or post-transcriptional silencing of the oncosuppressor miR-205 and sustains the malignant phenotype. Overexpressed ERBB3 behaves as a specific signaling platform for fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), driving PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway hyperactivation, and overall metabolic upregulation. As a result, ERBB3 inhibition by specific antibodies is lethal for GBM stem-like cells and xenotransplants. These findings highlight a subset of patients eligible for ERBB3-targeted therapy.

Abstract: Summary
To generate haploid gametes, germ cells undergo two consecutive meiotic divisions requiring key changes to the cell division machinery. Here, we demonstrate that the protease separase rewires key cell division processes at the meiosis I/II transition by cleaving the meiosis-specific protein Meikin. Separase proteolysis does not inactivate Meikin but instead alters its function to create a distinct activity state. Full-length Meikin and the C-terminal Meikin separase cleavage product both localize to kinetochores, bind to Plk1 kinase, and promote Rec8 cleavage, but our results reveal distinct roles for these proteins in controlling meiosis. Mutations that prevent Meikin cleavage or that conditionally inactivate Meikin at anaphase I result in defective meiosis II chromosome alignment in mouse oocytes. Finally, as oocytes exit meiosis, C-Meikin is eliminated by APC/C-mediated degradation prior to the first mitotic division. Thus, multiple regulatory events irreversibly modulate Meikin activity during successive meiotic divisions to rewire the cell division machinery at two distinct transitions.

Abstract: Summary
The immunological synapse is a complex structure that decodes stimulatory signals into adapted lymphocyte responses. It is a unique window to monitor lymphocyte activity because of development of systematic quantitative approaches. Here we demonstrate the applicability of high-content imaging to human T and natural killer (NK) cells and develop a pipeline for unbiased analysis of high-definition morphological profiles. Our approach reveals how distinct facets of actin cytoskeleton remodeling shape immunological synapse architecture and affect lytic granule positioning. Morphological profiling of CD8+ T cells from immunodeficient individuals allows discrimination of the roles of the ARP2/3 subunit ARPC1B and the ARP2/3 activator Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) in immunological synapse assembly. Single-cell analysis further identifies uncoupling of lytic granules and F-actin radial distribution in ARPC1B-deficient lymphocytes. Our study provides a foundation for development of morphological profiling as a scalable approach to monitor primary lymphocyte responsiveness and to identify complex aspects of lymphocyte micro-architecture.

Abstract: Summary
Maturation of canonical microRNA (miRNA) is initiated by DROSHA that cleaves the primary transcript (pri-miRNA). More than 1,800 miRNA loci are annotated in humans, but it remains largely unknown whether and at which sites pri-miRNAs are cleaved by DROSHA. Here, we performed in vitro processing on a full set of human pri-miRNAs (miRBase version 21) followed by sequencing. This comprehensive profiling enabled us to classify miRNAs on the basis of DROSHA dependence and map their cleavage sites with respective processing efficiency measures. Only 758 pri-miRNAs are confidently processed by DROSHA, while the majority may be non-canonical or false entries. Analyses of the DROSHA-dependent pri-miRNAs show key cis-elements for processing. We observe widespread alternative processing and unproductive cleavage events such as “nick” or “inverse” processing. SRSF3 is a broad-acting auxiliary factor modulating alternative processing and suppressing unproductive processing. The profiling data and methods developed in this study will allow systematic analyses of miRNA regulation.

Abstract: Intrinsic neuronal activity is a hallmark of the developing brain. In rodents, a handful of such activities were described in different cortical areas but the unifying macroscopic perspective is still lacking. Here we combined large-scale in vivo Ca2+ imaging of the dorsal cortex in non-anesthetized neonatal mice with mathematical analyses to reveal unique behavioral state-specific maps of intrinsic activity. These maps were remarkably stable over time within and across experiments and used patches of correlated activity with little hemispheric symmetry as well as stationary and propagating waves as building blocks. Importantly, the maps recorded during motion and rest were almost inverse, with frontoparietal areas active during motion and posterior-lateral areas active at rest. The retrosplenial cortex engaged in both resting- and motion-related activities via functional long-range connections with respective cortical areas. The data obtained bind different region-specific activity patterns described so far into a single consistent picture and set the stage for future inactivation studies, probing the exact function of this complex activity pattern for cortical wiring in neonates.

Abstract: Summary
Neonates are highly susceptible to bacterial meningitis as compared to children and adults. Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of neonatal meningitis. Neonatal meningitis can result from GBS intestinal colonization and translocation across the intestinal barrier (IB). Here, we show that the immaturity of the neonatal intestinal microbiota leads to low resistance to GBS intestinal colonization and permissiveness of the gut-vascular barrier. Moreover, the age-dependent but microbiota-independent Wnt activity in intestinal and choroid plexus (CP) epithelia results in a lower degree of cell-cell junctions’ polarization, which favors bacterial translocation. This study thus reveals that neonatal susceptibility to GBS meningitis results from the age-dependent immaturity of the intestinal microbiota and developmental pathways associated with neonatal tissue growth, which both concur to GBS gut colonization, systemic dissemination, and neuroinvasion. Whereas the activation of developmental pathways is intrinsic to neonates, interventions aimed at maturing the microbiota may help prevent neonatal meningitis.

Abstract: Summary
Astrocytic contributions to neuroinflammation are widely implicated in disease, but they remain incompletely explored. We assess medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual cortex (VCX) astrocyte and whole-tissue gene expression changes in mice following peripherally induced neuroinflammation triggered by a systemic bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide, which produces sickness-related behaviors, including anhedonia. Neuroinflammation-mediated behavioral changes and astrocyte-specific gene expression alterations peak when anhedonia is greatest and then reverse to normal. Notably, region-specific molecular identities of PFC and VCX astrocytes are largely maintained during reactivity changes. Gene pathway analyses reveal alterations of diverse cell signaling pathways, including changes in cell-cell interactions of multiple cell types that may underlie the central effects of neuroinflammation. Certain astrocyte molecular signatures accompanying neuroinflammation are shared with changes reported in Alzheimer’s disease and mouse models. However, we find no evidence of altered neuronal survival or function in the PFC even when neuroinflammation-induced astrocyte reactivity and behavioral changes are significant.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic Th17 cells drive inflammation in autoimmune disease, yet the molecular programming underlying Th17 cell pathogenicity remains insufficiently understood. Activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) increases Th17 cell inflammatory potential, but little is known regarding the mechanistic outcomes of TLR2 signaling in Th17 cells. Here, we demonstrate that TLR2 is comparable to IL-23 in inducing pathogenicity and increasing the migratory capacity of Th17 cells. We perform RNA sequencing of Th17 cells stimulated though the TLR2 pathway and find differential expression of several genes linked with the Th17 genetic program as well as genes not previously associated with pathogenic Th17 cells, including Ipcef1. Enforced expression of Ipcef1 in Th17 cells abolishes the TLR2-dependent increases in migratory capacity and severely impairs the ability of Th17 cells to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. This study establishes the importance of the TLR2 signaling pathway in inducing Th17 cell pathogenicity and driving autoimmune inflammation.

Abstract: Prepared sections from pre-pubertal, pubertal, adult, and aged Japanese quail testes were examined by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and measurements of seminiferous tubular diameter (STD), luminal diameter (SLD), epithelial height (SEH) and cross-sectional area of the seminiferous tubules (AST) were taken using an image analyzer. Apoptotic Sertoli cells with features such as cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation were observed in pre-pubertal and aged quail. There was a significant difference between the mean Sertoli cell number (SCN), SLD, SEH, STD and AST among the four age groups (P < 0.001). The highest SCN (mean ± standard error) was recorded in the adult (30.53 ± 0.42), with the aged group displaying the lowest mean (11.80 ± 0.27) SCN. Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients demonstrated a strong relationship between the SCN and SEH in the pubertal (ρ=0.915; P < 0.001), adult (ρ=0.878; P < 0.001), and aged (ρ=0.858; P < 0.001) groups, while a significant moderate correlation was observed in the pre-pubertal (ρ=0.606; P < 0.001) group. There were significant moderate correlations between the SCN and STD in the pre-pubertal (ρ=0.445; P < 0.001), pubertal (ρ=0.653; P < 0.001), adult (ρ=0.440; P < 0.001), and aged (ρ=0.514; P < 0.001) groups. Furthermore, significant moderate correlations were estimated between the SCN and AST in the pre-pubertal (ρ=0.453; P < 0.001), pubertal (ρ=0.661; P < 0.001), adult (ρ=0.393; P = 0.001), and aged (ρ=0.498; P < 0.001) groups. This study provides baseline data on the morphology and development of the Sertoli cell, as well as testicular morphometry in avian species during the pre-pubertal, pubertal, adult, and aged stages using the Japanese quail as a model.

Abstract: Summary
Appropriate cristae remodeling is a determinant of mitochondrial function and bioenergetics and thus represents a crucial process for cellular metabolic adaptations. Here, we show that mitochondrial cristae architecture and expression of the master cristae-remodeling protein OPA1 in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, which are key metabolic sensors implicated in energy balance control, is affected by fluctuations in nutrient availability. Genetic inactivation of OPA1 in POMC neurons causes dramatic alterations in cristae topology, mitochondrial Ca2+ handling, reduction in alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) in target areas, hyperphagia, and attenuated white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis resulting in obesity. Pharmacological blockade of mitochondrial Ca2+ influx restores α-MSH and the lipolytic program, while improving the metabolic defects of mutant mice. Chemogenetic manipulation of POMC neurons confirms a role in lipolysis control. Our results unveil a novel axis that connects OPA1 in POMC neurons with mitochondrial cristae, Ca2+ homeostasis, and WAT lipolysis in the regulation of energy balance.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles that undergo dynamic changes in response to changing cellular conditions. During nutrient depletion, LD numbers increase to protect cells against toxic fatty acids generated through autophagy and provide fuel for beta-oxidation. However, the precise mechanisms through which these changes are regulated have remained unclear. Here, we show that the small GTPase RalA acts downstream of autophagy to directly facilitate LD growth during nutrient depletion. Mechanistically, RalA performs this function through phospholipase D1 (PLD1), an enzyme that converts phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidic acid (PA) and that is recruited to lysosomes during nutrient stress in a RalA-dependent fashion. RalA inhibition prevents recruitment of the LD-associated protein perilipin 3, which is required for LD growth. Our data support a model in which RalA recruits PLD1 to lysosomes during nutrient deprivation to promote the localized production of PA and the recruitment of perilipin 3 to expanding LDs.

Abstract: Purpose
Although human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) can contribute to the growth of tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), however, little is known about the exact mechanisms by which the exosomes secreted from hucMSCs (hucMSCs-exo) have an oncogenic effect on the physiopathology of PDAC. The effects of hucMSCs on tumor development are attributed to hucMSCs-exo, which deliver unique proteins and miRNAs to cancer cells.
Methods
HucMSCs and exosomes were isolated and confirmed via transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blot. The nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously on both flanks with human pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells (1 × 106), and hucMSCs-exo were directly administered via intratumoral injection once a day for three days each week. Cell proliferation assays were performed using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and the cell invasion assay was performed using Transwell assay. The miRNA data were predicted and analyzed by miRanda software. The analysis of the target genes of the miRNAs was proformed with the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases.
Results
Firstly, we observed that hucMSCs-exo promoted Panc-1 and BxPC3 cell growth by increasing proliferation and migration in vitro. Secondly, in a xenograft tumor model, hucMSCs-exo increased the growth of Panc-1 cells. Thirdly, high-throughput sequencing of hucMSCs-exo showed that hsa-miR-148a-3p, hsa-miR-100-5p, hsa-miR-143-3p, hsa-miR-21-5p and hsa-miR-92a-3p were highly expressed. For the five identified miRNAs, 1308 target genes were predicted by miRanda software. From the GO and KEGG analyses of the target genes of the identified miRNAs, it was found that the main GO function was the regulation of cellular glucuronidation, and the main KEGG metabolic pathway involved the metabolism of ascorbic acid and aldehyde acid. These processes are related to the occurrence and development of pancreatic cancer. Finally, we observed that miR-100-5p promoted Panc-1 and BxPC3 cell growth in vitro and in vivo.
Conclusion
Here, by utilizing exosomes secreted from hucMSCs, we systematically investigated the effects of hucMSCs-exo on PDAC growth in vitro and in vivo for the first time. Building on these results, we provided new insights into the role of hucMSCs-exo in the PDAC growth and revealed the attractive communication between hucMSCs and PDAC cells that occurs through MSCs-exosomes-miRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
PARP7 is a monoPARP that catalyzes the transfer of single units of ADP-ribose onto substrates to change their function. Here, we identify PARP7 as a negative regulator of nucleic acid sensing in tumor cells. Inhibition of PARP7 restores type I interferon (IFN) signaling responses to nucleic acids in tumor models. Restored signaling can directly inhibit cell proliferation and activate the immune system, both of which contribute to tumor regression. Oral dosing of the PARP7 small-molecule inhibitor, RBN-2397, results in complete tumor regression in a lung cancer xenograft and induces tumor-specific adaptive immune memory in an immunocompetent mouse cancer model, dependent on inducing type I IFN signaling in tumor cells. PARP7 is a therapeutic target whose inhibition induces both cancer cell-autonomous and immune stimulatory effects via enhanced IFN signaling. These data support the targeting of a monoPARP in cancer and introduce a potent and selective PARP7 inhibitor to enter clinical development.

Epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin requires DNA-sequence-independent propagation mechanisms, coupling to RNAi, or input from DNA sequence, but how DNA contributes to inheritance is not understood. Here, we identify a DNA element (termed “maintainer”) that is sufficient for epigenetic inheritance of pre-existing histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) and heterochromatin in Schizosaccharomyces pombe but cannot establish de novo gene silencing in wild-type cells. This maintainer is a composite DNA element with binding sites for the Atf1/Pcr1 and Deb1 transcription factors and the origin recognition complex (ORC), located within a 130-bp region, and can be converted to a silencer in cells with lower rates of H3K9me turnover, suggesting that it participates in recruiting the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4/Suv39h. These results suggest that, in the absence of RNAi, histone H3K9me is only heritable when it can collaborate with maintainer-associated DNA-binding proteins that help recruit the enzyme responsible for its epigenetic deposition.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatosomes play a fundamental role in chromatin regulation, but a detailed understanding of their structure is lacking, partially due to their complex dynamics. Using single-molecule DNA unzipping with optical tweezers, we reveal that linker histone interactions with DNA are remarkably extended, with the C-terminal domain binding both DNA linkers as far as approximately ±140 bp from the dyad. In addition to a symmetrical compaction of the nucleosome core governed by globular domain contacts at the dyad, the C-terminal domain compacts the nucleosome’s entry and exit. These interactions are dynamic, exhibit rapid binding and dissociation, are sensitive to phosphorylation of a specific residue, and are crucial to determining the symmetry of the chromatosome’s core. Extensive unzipping of the linker DNA, which mimics its invasion by motor proteins, shifts H1 into an asymmetric, off-dyad configuration and triggers nucleosome decompaction, highlighting the plasticity of the chromatosome structure and its potential regulatory role.

Abstract: Versican (VCAN) is verified to promote development among many cancers, whose function on gastric cancer (GC) is less studied. This work explored the effect of VCNA on GC. The differentially expressed VCAN between tumor and normal samples, among different cancer stages and the overall survival of GC patients with high and low VCAN levels were predicted through Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2). The association between VCAN and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed by clinical investigation. AGS and NCI-N87 cells were transfected with VCAN short hairpin RNA (shVCAN) and VCAN overexpression plasmid. The VCNA, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin and Vimentin expression was detected through quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Cell viability was assessed through MTT assay. Cell migration was measured by wound healing assay and cell invasion was evaluated through Transwell assay. Cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry assay. VCAN was upregulated in GC and its high expression related to advanced TNM stage, Lymph node metastasis, Depth of invasion and Grade. VCAN knockdown inhibited multiplication, migration, invasion, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, N-Cadherin and Vimentin expression while induced cycle arrest and E-Cadherin level of GC cells, whereas overexpressed VCAN showed opposite results. VCAN had a potential to be a biomarker for GC and overexpressed VCAN promoted GC cell multiplication, migration and invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription elongation has emerged as a regulatory hub in gene expression of metazoans. A major control point occurs during early elongation before RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is released into productive elongation. Prior research has linked BRD4 with transcription elongation. Here, we use rapid BET protein and BRD4-selective degradation along with quantitative genome-wide approaches to investigate direct functions of BRD4 in Pol II transcription regulation. Notably, as an immediate consequence of acute BRD4 loss, promoter-proximal pause release is impaired, and transcriptionally engaged Pol II past this checkpoint undergoes readthrough transcription. An integrated proteome-wide analysis uncovers elongation and 3′-RNA processing factors as core BRD4 interactors. BRD4 ablation disrupts the recruitment of general 3′-RNA processing factors at the 5′-control region, which correlates with RNA cleavage and termination defects. These studies, performed in human cells, reveal a BRD4-mediated checkpoint and begin to establish a molecular link between 5′-elongation control and 3′-RNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Electron transport chain (ETC) dysfunction or hypoxia causes toxic NADH accumulation. How cells regenerate NAD+ under such conditions remains elusive. Here, integrating bioinformatic analysis and experimental validation, we identify glycerol-3-phosphate (Gro3P) biosynthesis as an endogenous NAD+-regeneration pathway. Under genetic or pharmacological ETC inhibition, disrupting Gro3P synthesis inhibits yeast proliferation, shortens lifespan of C. elegans, impairs growth of cancer cells in culture and in xenografts, and causes metabolic derangements in mouse liver. Moreover, the Gro3P shuttle selectively regenerates cytosolic NAD+ under mitochondrial complex I inhibition; enhancing Gro3P synthesis promotes shuttle activity to restore proliferation of complex I-impaired cells. Mouse brain has much lower levels of Gro3P synthesis enzymes as compared with other organs. Strikingly, enhancing Gro3P synthesis suppresses neuroinflammation and extends lifespan in the Ndufs4−/− mice. Collectively, our results reveal Gro3P biosynthesis as an evolutionarily conserved coordinator of NADH/NAD+ redox homeostasis and present a therapeutic target for mitochondrial complex I diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Bearing a relatively large single-stranded RNA genome in nature, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes sophisticated replication/transcription complexes (RTCs), mainly composed of a network of nonstructural proteins and nucleocapsid protein, to establish efficient infection. In this study, we develop an innovative interaction screening strategy based on phase separation in cellulo, namely compartmentalization of protein-protein interactions in cells (CoPIC). Utilizing CoPIC screening, we map the interaction network among RTC-related viral proteins. We identify a total of 47 binary interactions among 14 proteins governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses. Further exploration via CoPIC leads to the discovery of extensive ternary complexes composed of these components, which infer potential higher-order complexes. Taken together, our results present an efficient and robust interaction screening strategy, and they indicate the existence of a complex interaction network among RTC-related factors, thus opening up opportunities to understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and develop therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer, is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. We perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on samples from 43 primary patients with NSCLC and matched normal samples and analyze their matched open chromatin data and transcriptome data. Our results indicate that next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the Bionano Genomics (BNG) platform should be viewed as complementary technologies in terms of structural variations detection. By creating a framework integrating these two platforms, we detect high-technical-confidence somatic structural variations (SVs) in NSCLC cases, which could aid in the efficient investigation of new candidate oncogenes, such as TRIO and SESTD1. Our findings highlight the impact of somatic SVs on NSCLC oncogenesis and lay a foundation for exploring associations among somatic SVs, gene expression, and regulatory networks in patients with NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
lncRNA taurine-upregulated gene 1 (Tug1) is a promising therapeutic target in the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN), but the molecular basis of its protection remains poorly understood. Here, we generate a triple-mutant diabetic mouse model coupled with metabolomic profiling data to interrogate whether Tug1 interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC1α) is required for mitochondrial remodeling and progression of DN in vivo. We find that, compared with diabetic conditional deletion of Pgc1α in podocytes alone (db/db; Pgc1αPod-f/f), diabetic Pgc1α knockout combined with podocyte-specific Tug1 overexpression (db/db; TugPodTg; Pgc1αPod-f/f) reverses the protective phenotype of Tug1 overexpression, suggesting that PGC1α is required for the renoprotective effect of Tug1. Using unbiased metabolomic profiling, we find that altered urea cycle metabolites and mitochondrial arginase 2 play an important role in Tug1/PGC1α-induced mitochondrial remodeling. Our work identifies a functional role of the Tug1/PGC1α axis on mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis and urea cycle metabolites in experimental models of diabetes.

Abstract: Decidualization is characterized by a series of genetic, metabolic, morphological, biochemical, vascular and immune changes occurring in the endometrial stroma in response to the implanting embryo or even before conception and involves the stromal cells of the endometrium. It is a fundamental reproductive event occurring in mammalian species with hemochorial placentation. A growing body of experimental and clinical evidence strongly suggests that defective or disrupted decidualization contributes to the establishment of an inappropriate maternal-fetal interface. This has relevant clinical consequences, ranging from recurrent implantation failure and recurrent pregnancy loss in early pregnancy to several significant complications of advanced gestation. Moreover, recent evidence indicates that selected diseases of the endometrium, such as chronic endometritis and endometriosis, can have a detrimental impact on the decidualization response in the endometrium and may help explain some aspects of the reduced reproductive outcome associated with these conditions. Further research efforts are needed to fully understand the biomolecular mechanisms ans events underlying an abnormal decidualization response. This will permit the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies aimed to improve the likelihood of achieveing a successful pregnancy.

Abstract: Summary
Persistent senescent cells (SCs) are known to underlie aging-related chronic disorders, but it is now recognized that SCs may be at the center of tissue remodeling events, namely during development or organ repair. In this study, we show that two distinct senescence profiles are induced in the context of a spinal cord injury between the regenerative zebrafish and the scarring mouse. Whereas induced SCs in zebrafish are progressively cleared out, they accumulate over time in mice. Depletion of SCs in spinal-cord-injured mice, with different senolytic drugs, improves locomotor, sensory, and bladder functions. This functional recovery is associated with improved myelin sparing, reduced fibrotic scar, and attenuated inflammation, which correlate with a decreased secretion of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory factors. Targeting SCs is a promising therapeutic strategy not only for spinal cord injuries but potentially for other organs that lack regenerative competence.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to acetylation, histones are modified by a series of competing longer-chain acylations. Most of these acylation marks are enriched and co-exist with acetylation on active gene regulatory elements. Their seemingly redundant functions hinder our understanding of histone acylations’ specific roles. Here, by using an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell model and blasts from individuals with B-precusor ALL (B-ALL), we demonstrate a role of mitochondrial activity in controlling the histone acylation/acetylation ratio, especially at histone H4 lysine 5 (H4K5). An increase in the ratio of non-acetyl acylations (crotonylation or butyrylation) over acetylation on H4K5 weakens bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4) bromodomain-dependent chromatin interaction and enhances BRD4 nuclear mobility and availability for binding transcription start site regions of active genes. Our data suggest that the metabolism-driven control of the histone acetylation/longer-chain acylation(s) ratio could be a common mechanism regulating the bromodomain factors’ functional genomic distribution.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells selectively promote translation of specific oncogenic transcripts to facilitate cancer survival and progression, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we find that N7-methylguanosine (m7G) tRNA modification and its methyltransferase complex components, METTL1 and WDR4, are significantly upregulated in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and associated with poor prognosis. We further reveal the critical role of METTL1/WDR4 in promoting ICC cell survival and progression using loss- and gain-of-function assays in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, m7G tRNA modification selectively regulates the translation of oncogenic transcripts, including cell-cycle and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway genes, in m7G-tRNA-decoded codon-frequency-dependent mechanisms. Moreover, using overexpression and knockout mouse models, we demonstrate the crucial oncogenic function of Mettl1-mediated m7G tRNA modification in promoting ICC tumorigenesis and progression in vivo. Our study uncovers the important physiological function and mechanism of METTL1-mediated m7G tRNA modification in the regulation of oncogenic mRNA translation and cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
The histone chaperone FACT occupies transcribed regions where it plays prominent roles in maintaining chromatin integrity and preserving epigenetic information. How it is targeted to transcribed regions, however, remains unclear. Proposed models include docking on the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal domain (CTD), recruitment by elongation factors, recognition of modified histone tails, and binding partially disassembled nucleosomes. Here, we systematically test these and other scenarios in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and find that FACT binds transcribed chromatin, not RNAPII. Through a combination of high-resolution genome-wide mapping, single-molecule tracking, and mathematical modeling, we propose that FACT recognizes the +1 nucleosome, as it is partially unwrapped by the engaging RNAPII, and spreads to downstream nucleosomes aided by the chromatin remodeler Chd1. Our work clarifies how FACT interacts with genes, suggests a processive mechanism for FACT function, and provides a framework to further dissect the molecular mechanisms of transcription-coupled histone chaperoning.

Abstract: Summary
The pathogenic mechanism by which dominant mutations in VCP cause multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), a rare neurodegenerative disease that presents as fronto-temporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), remains unclear. To explore this, we inactivate VCP in murine postnatal forebrain neurons (VCP conditional knockout [cKO]). VCP cKO mice have cortical brain atrophy, neuronal loss, autophago-lysosomal dysfunction, and TDP-43 inclusions resembling FTLD-TDP pathology. Conditional expression of a single disease-associated mutation, VCP-R155C, in a VCP null background similarly recapitulates features of VCP inactivation and FTLD-TDP, suggesting that this MSP mutation is hypomorphic. Comparison of transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from genetically defined patients with FTLD-TDP reveal that progranulin deficiency and VCP insufficiency result in similar profiles. These data identify a loss of VCP-dependent functions as a mediator of FTLD-TDP and reveal an unexpected biochemical similarity with progranulin deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cells (SCs) play a key role in homeostasis and repair. While many studies have focused on SC self-renewal and differentiation, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism regulating SC elimination and compensation upon loss. Here, we report that Caspase-9 deletion in hair follicle SCs (HFSCs) attenuates the apoptotic cascade, resulting in significant temporal delays. Surprisingly, Casp9-deficient HFSCs accumulate high levels of cleaved caspase-3 and are improperly cleared due to an essential caspase-3/caspase-9 feedforward loop. These SCs are retained in an apoptotic-engaged state, serving as mitogenic signaling centers by continuously releasing Wnt3 and instructing proliferation. Investigating the underlying mechanism, we reveal a caspase-3/Dusp8/p38 module responsible for Wnt3 induction, which operates in both normal and Casp9-deleted HFSCs. Notably, Casp9-deleted mice display accelerated wound repair and de novo hair follicle regeneration. Taken together, we demonstrate that apoptotic cells represent a dynamic SC niche, from which emanating signals drive SC proliferation and tissue regeneration

Abstract: Patients with severe asthma have unmet clinical needs for effective and safe therapies. One possibility may be mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, which can improve asthma in murine models. However, it remains unclear how MSCs exert their beneficial effects in asthma. Here, we examined the effect of human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUC-MSC) on two mouse models of severe asthma, namely, Alternaria alternata-induced and house dust mite (HDM)/diesel exhaust particle (DEP)-induced asthma. hUC-MSC treatment attenuated lung type 2 (Th2 and type 2 innate lymphoid cell) inflammation in both models. However, these effects were only observed with particular treatment routes and timings. In vitro co-culture showed that hUC-MSC directly downregulated the interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13 production of differentiated mouse Th2 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from asthma patients. Thus, these results showed that hUC-MSC treatment can ameliorate asthma by suppressing the asthmogenic cytokine production of effector cells. However, the successful clinical application of MSCs in the future is likely to require careful optimization of the route, dosage, and timing.

Abstract: The left-right organizer in zebrafish embryos, Kupffer's Vesicle (KV), is a simple organ that undergoes programmed asymmetric cell shape changes that are necessary to establish the left-right axis of the embryo. We use simulations and experiments to investigate whether 3D mechanical drag forces generated by the posteriorly-directed motion of the KV through the tailbud tissue are sufficient to drive such shape changes. We develop a fully 3D vertex-like (Voronoi) model for the tissue architecture, and demonstrate that the tissue can generate drag forces and drive cell shape changes. Furthermore, we find that tailbud tissue presents a shear-thinning, viscoelastic behavior consistent with those observed in published experiments. We then perform live imaging experiments and particle image velocimetry analysis to quantify the precise tissue velocity gradients around KV as a function of developmental time. We observe robust velocity gradients around the KV, indicating that mechanical drag forces must be exerted on the KV by the tailbud tissue. We demonstrate that experimentally observed velocity fields are consistent with the viscoelastic response seen in simulations. This work also suggests that 3D viscoelastic drag forces could be a generic mechanism for cell shape change in other biological processes.

Abstract: Various methods have been used to induce the neuronal differentiation of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the limited induction efficiency of cells in vitro has restricted their use. Therefore, identifying a simple and efficient treatment method is necessary. Dendrobium officinale is an important traditional Chinese medicine, and its main component, polysaccharides, has many pharmacological activities. However, the effects of D. officinale polysaccharide (DOP) on the neuronal differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and treatment of ischaemic stroke remain unknown. We found that DOP promoted the neuronal differentiation of BMSCs by increasing the expression levels of neural markers, and the optimal concentration of DOP was 25 μg/mL. Additionally, the Notch signalling pathway was inhibited during the neuronal differentiation of BMSCs induced by DOP, and this effect was strengthened using an inhibitor of this pathway. The Wnt signalling pathway was activated during the differentiation of BMSCs, and inhibition of the Wnt signalling pathway downregulated the expression of neuronal genes. Furthermore, the transplantation of neuron-like cells induced by DOP improved neuronal recovery, as the brain infarct volume, neurologic severity scores and levels of inflammatory factors were all significantly reduced in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial tip cells guiding tissue vascularization are primary targets for angiogenic therapies. Whether tip cells require differential signals to develop their complex branching patterns remained unknown. Here, we show that diving tip cells invading the mouse neuroretina (D-tip cells) are distinct from tip cells guiding the superficial retinal vascular plexus (S-tip cells). D-tip cells have a unique transcriptional signature, including high TGF-β signaling, and they begin to acquire blood-retina barrier properties. Endothelial deletion of TGF-β receptor I (Alk5) inhibits D-tip cell identity acquisition and deep vascular plexus formation. Loss of endothelial ALK5, but not of the canonical SMAD effectors, leads to aberrant contractile pericyte differentiation and hemorrhagic vascular malformations. Oxygen-induced retinopathy vasculature exhibits S-like tip cells, and Alk5 deletion impedes retina revascularization. Our data reveal stage-specific tip cell heterogeneity as a requirement for retinal vascular development and suggest that non-canonical-TGF-β signaling could improve retinal revascularization and neural function in ischemic retinopathy.

Abstract: Summary
The anti-tumor response of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells requires the sensing of accumulated phosphoantigens (pAgs) bound intracellularly to butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1). In this study, we show that butyrophilin 2A1 (BTN2A1) is required for BTN3A-mediated Vγ9Vδ2 T cell cytotoxicity against cancer cells, and that expression of the BTN2A1/BTN3A1 complex is sufficient to trigger Vγ9Vδ2 TCR activation. Also, BTN2A1 interacts with all isoforms of BTN3A (BTN3A1, BTN3A2, BTN3A3), which appears to be a rate-limiting factor to BTN2A1 export to the plasma membrane. BTN2A1/BTN3A1 interaction is enhanced by pAgs and, strikingly, B30.2 domains of both proteins are required for pAg responsiveness. BTN2A1 expression in cancer cells correlates with bisphosphonate-induced Vγ9Vδ2 T cell cytotoxicity. Vγ9Vδ2 T cell killing of cancer cells is modulated by anti-BTN2A1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), whose action relies on the inhibition of BTN2A1 binding to the Vγ9Vδ2TCR. This demonstrates the potential of BTN2A1 as a therapeutic target and adds to the emerging butyrophilin-family cooperation pathway in γδ T cell activation.

Abstract: Background
Gastric cancer) GC) is one of the most common cancer with high mortality worldwide. The human Wharton's jelly stem cells (hWJSCs) can inhibit several cancer cells through several molecular pathways. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate anticancer effects of hWJSCs conditioned medium (hWJSC-CM) and cell-free lysate (hWJSC-CL) against of GC cell line AGS and underlying signaling pathways.
Methods
In this study, we evaluated the effects of hWJSC-CM and hWJSC-CL on viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways in AGS cells. Moreover, mRNA expression of genes involved in apoptosis (BAX, BCL2, SMAC, and SURVIVIN), as well as expression of proteins involved in NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways were evaluated.
Results
The obtained results showed that the hWJSC-CM and hWJSC-CL decreased viability, migration, and invasion of GC cell line AGS in a concentration and time dependent manner. We observed that the hWJSC-CM and hWJSC-CL induced apoptosis pathway through regulation of apoptosis involved genes mRNA expression. In addition, the hWJSC-CM and hWJSC-CL suppressed NF-κB signaling pathways as well as promoted MAPK signaling pathways.
Conclusion
In general, our study suggested that the hWJSC-CM and hWJSC-CL inhibits proliferation and viability of GC cell line AGS through induction of apoptosis, as well as modification of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Aneuploidy, an unbalanced number of chromosomes, is highly deleterious at the cellular level and leads to senescence, a stress-induced response characterized by permanent cell-cycle arrest and a well-defined associated secretory phenotype. Here, we use a Drosophila epithelial model to delineate the pathway that leads to the induction of senescence as a consequence of the acquisition of an aneuploid karyotype. Whereas aneuploidy induces, as a result of gene dosage imbalance, proteotoxic stress and activation of the major protein quality control mechanisms, near-saturation functioning of autophagy leads to compromised mitophagy, accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, and the production of radical oxygen species (ROS). We uncovered a role of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in driving senescence as a consequence of dysfunctional mitochondria and ROS. We show that activation of the major protein quality control mechanisms and mitophagy dampens the deleterious effects of aneuploidy, and we identify a role of senescence in proteostasis and compensatory proliferation for tissue repair.

Abstract: Summary
The super elongation complex (SEC) contains the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and the subcomplex ELL2-EAF1, which stimulates RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) elongation. Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of ELL2-EAF1 bound to a RNA Pol II elongation complex at 2.8 Å resolution. The ELL2-EAF1 dimerization module directly binds the RNA Pol II lobe domain, explaining how SEC delivers P-TEFb to RNA Pol II. The same site on the lobe also binds the initiation factor TFIIF, consistent with SEC binding only after the transition from transcription initiation to elongation. Structure-guided functional analysis shows that the stimulation of RNA elongation requires the dimerization module and the ELL2 linker that tethers the module to the RNA Pol II protrusion. Our results show that SEC stimulates elongation allosterically and indicate that this stimulation involves stabilization of a closed conformation of the RNA Pol II active center cleft.

Abstract: Cilia are highly specialized organelles that extend from the cell membrane and function as cellular signaling hubs. Thus, cilia formation and the trafficking of signaling molecules into cilia are essential cellular processes. TULP3 and Tubby (TUB) are members of the tubby-like protein (TULP) family that regulate the ciliary trafficking of G-protein coupled receptors, but the functions of the remaining TULPs (i.e., TULP1 and TULP2) remain unclear. Herein, we explore whether these four structurally similar TULPs share a molecular function in ciliary protein trafficking. We found that TULP3 and TUB, but not TULP1 or TULP2, can rescue the defective cilia formation observed in TULP3-knockout (KO) hTERT RPE-1 cells. TULP3 and TUB also fully rescue the defective ciliary localization of ARL13B, INPP5E, and GPR161 in TULP3 KO RPE-1 cells, while TULP1 and TULP2 only mediate partial rescues. Furthermore, loss of TULP3 results in abnormal IFT140 localization, which can be fully rescued by TUB and partially rescued by TULP1 and TULP2. TUB’s capacity for binding IFT-A is essential for its role in cilia formation and ciliary protein trafficking in RPE-1 cells, whereas its capacity for PIP2 binding is required for proper cilia length and IFT140 localization. Finally, chimeric TULP1 containing the IFT-A binding domain of TULP3 fully rescues ciliary protein trafficking, but not cilia formation. Together, these two TULP domains play distinct roles in ciliary protein trafficking but are insufficient for cilia formation in RPE-1 cells. In addition, TULP1 and TULP2 play other unknown molecular roles that should be addressed in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Recent multi-omics studies show different immune tumor microenvironment (TME) compositions in glioblastoma (GBM). However, temporal comprehensive knowledge of the TME from initiation of the disease remains sparse. We use Cre recombinase (Cre)-inducible lentiviral murine GBM models to compare the cellular evolution of the immune TME in tumors initiated from different oncogenic drivers. We show that neutrophils infiltrate early during tumor progression primarily in the mesenchymal GBM model. Depleting neutrophils in vivo at the onset of disease accelerates tumor growth and reduces the median overall survival time of mice. We show that, as a tumor progresses, bone marrow-derived neutrophils are skewed toward a phenotype associated with pro-tumorigenic processes. Our findings suggest that GBM can remotely regulate systemic myeloid differentiation in the bone marrow to generate neutrophils pre-committed to a tumor-supportive phenotype. This work reveals plasticity in the systemic immune host microenvironment, suggesting an additional point of intervention in GBM treatment.

Abstract: Electrical activity and oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) that trigger insulin release in response to glucose are key functions of pancreatic β cells. Although oscillatory Ca2+ signals have been intensively studied in β cells, their lower frequency did not match that of electrical activity. In addition, the measured peak [Ca2+]i did not reach levels that are typically required by synaptotagmins to elicit the release of insulin-containing vesicles in live-cell experiments. We therefore sought to resolve the Ca2+ dynamics in the subplasmalemmal microdomain that is critical for triggering fast exocytosis. Applying total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in insulin-producing INS-1E and primary mouse β cells, we resolved extraordinary fast trains of Ca2+ spiking (frequency > 3 s−1) in response to glucose exposure. Using a low-affinity [Ca2+]i indicator dye, we provide experimental evidence that Ca2+ spikes reach low micromolar apparent concentrations in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. Analysis of Ca2+ spikes evoked by repeated depolarization for 10 ms closely matched the Ca2+ dynamics observed upon glucose application. To our knowledge, this is the first study that experimentally demonstrates Ca2+ spikes in β cells with velocities that resemble those of bursting or continuously appearing trains of action potentials (APs) in non-patched cells.

Abstract: Summary
Glutamate receptor ion channels, including α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission in the CNS. Previous work suggested that AMPA receptors produce a synaptic current with a millisecond duration. However, we find that about two-thirds of principal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region also express AMPA receptors with reduced desensitization that can stay active for half a second after repetitive stimuli. These slow AMPA receptors are expressed at about half of the synapses, with a flat spatial distribution. The increased charge transfer from slow AMPA receptors allows short-term potentiation from a postsynaptic locus and reliable triggering of action potentials. Biophysical and pharmacological observations imply slow AMPA receptors incorporate auxiliary proteins, and their activation lengthens miniature synaptic currents. These data indicate that AMPA receptors are a major source of synaptic diversity. Synapses harboring slow AMPA receptors could have unique roles in hippocampal function.

Abstract: The role of autophagy in the transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) to treat spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurogenic bladder was investigated in this study. NSCs derived from human iPSCs were identified by and immunofluorescence assay. To clarify the role of autophagy, iPSCs were treated with either an autophagy inducer (rapamycin), or an autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine). Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8), western blot and flow cytometry were used to detect the effect of autophagy on the viability and differentiation of iPSCs. Sixty Wistar rats were selected to establish the SCI model and treated with iPSCs-derived NSCs transplantation. The effect of autophagy on the bladder function of rats with different treatments was evaluated by Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score, bladder function score, bladder weight measurement, Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining, and Masson staining. The results of in vitro experiment showed that rapamycin enhanced the cell activity of iPSCs, increased the number of nestin positive cells, up-regulated Beclin-1 and LC3BI/II expressions, and down-regulated p62 expression. And the results of in vivo experiment showed that rapamycin improved exercise ability and bladder function, partially restored bladder weight, and significantly reduced bladder tissue damage in SCI rats. However, chloroquine showed the opposite results. The differentiation of iPSCs into NSCs could be promoted by induced autophagy, while neurogenic bladder of SCI was restored by autophagy activation.

Abstract: Summary
The evolutionarily conserved Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is a key antioxidant response pathway that protects cells/organisms against detrimental effects of oxidative stress. Impaired Nrf2 function is associated with cancer and neurodegenerative diseases in humans. However, the function of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in the developing nervous systems has not been established. Here we demonstrate a cell-autonomous role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway, composed of CncC/Nrf2, Keap1, and MafS, in governing neuronal remodeling during Drosophila metamorphosis. Nrf2-Keap1 signaling is activated downstream of the steroid hormone ecdysone. Mechanistically, the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is activated via cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of CncC in an importin- and ecdysone-signaling-dependent manner. Moreover, Nrf2-Keap1 signaling regulates dendrite pruning independent of its canonical antioxidant response pathway, acting instead through proteasomal degradation. This study reveals an epistatic link between the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway and steroid hormone signaling and demonstrates an antioxidant-independent but proteasome-dependent role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in neuronal remodeling.

Abstract: Metanil yellow is a food dye that has harmful impacts on different body systems. Scutellarin has antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of the current research was to study the effect of chronic administration of metanil yellow on the cerebellar cortex of rats and to evaluate the protective effect of scutellarin. Forty adult male rats were allocated into four groups: group I acted as control, group II was administrated scutellarin (100 mg/kg/day), group III was administrated metanil yellow (200 mg/kg/day), and group IV was administrated scutellarin and metanil yellow as in group II and group III. The agents were administered via oral gavage for 8 weeks. Metanil yellow induced a significant rise in the malondialdehyde coupled with a significant reduction in the superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The Purkinje cells were irregular and shrunken with condensed nuclei. A significant elevation in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cleaved caspase-3 as well as a significant reduction of synaptophysin expression were revealed in comparison with the control group. Interestingly, few changes were noticed in rats given metanil yellow concomitant with scutellarin. In conclusion, scutellarin could protect against metanil yellow-induced alterations in the cerebellar cortex by reducing oxidative stress and minimizing gliosis.

Abstract: Summary
Crossing over is essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis. Protein modification by SUMO is implicated in crossover control, but pertinent targets have remained elusive. Here we identify Msh4 as a target of SUMO-mediated crossover regulation. Msh4 and Msh5 constitute the MutSγ complex, which stabilizes joint-molecule (JM) recombination intermediates and facilitates their resolution into crossovers. Msh4 SUMOylation enhances these processes to ensure that each chromosome pair acquires at least one crossover. Msh4 is directly targeted by E2 conjugase Ubc9, initially becoming mono-SUMOylated in response to DNA double-strand breaks, then multi/poly-SUMOylated forms arise as homologs fully engage. Mechanistically, SUMOylation fosters interaction between Msh4 and Msh5. We infer that initial SUMOylation of Msh4 enhances assembly of MutSγ in anticipation of JM formation, while secondary SUMOylation may promote downstream functions. Regulation of Msh4 by SUMO is distinct and independent of its previously described stabilization by phosphorylation, defining MutSγ as a hub for crossover control.

Abstract: Summary
Although peripheral B cell dysfunction in early HIV infection is established, how B cell subsets are altered by HIV infection is poorly understood. While investigating B cell subsets among individuals recently infected with HIV, we observe an accumulation of CD27−CD38+ B cells and find that these cells can directly facilitate HIV infection of primary CD4+ T cells in vitro. Comprehensive analyses of the phenotype, function, and transcriptome of the CD27−CD38+ B cell subset is conducted compared with memory and naive B cells. We find that the CD27−CD38+ B cells exhibit a transitional B cell phenotype and an extremely high turnover rate. Importantly, individuals with higher proportions of CD27−CD38+ B cells during early HIV infection tend to become rapid progressors in the chronic infection stage. In this study, we identify a peripheral transitional B cell subset that accumulates during early HIV infection and may contribute to disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Based on in vitro studies, it has been demonstrated that the DSIF complex, composed of SPT4 and SPT5, regulates the elongation stage of transcription catalyzed by RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II). The precise cellular function of SPT5 is not clear, because conventional gene depletion strategies for SPT5 result in loss of cellular viability. Using an acute inducible protein depletion strategy to circumvent this issue, we report that SPT5 loss triggers the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the core RNA Pol II subunit RPB1, a process that we show to be evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human cells. RPB1 degradation requires the E3 ligase Cullin 3, the unfoldase VCP/p97, and a novel form of CDK9 kinase complex. Our study demonstrates that SPT5 stabilizes RNA Pol II specifically at promoter-proximal regions, permitting RNA Pol II release from promoters into gene bodies and providing mechanistic insight into the cellular function of SPT5 in safeguarding accurate gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
The mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH; arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus [ARH] and median eminence [ME]) is a key nutrient sensing site for the production of the complex homeostatic feedback responses required for the maintenance of energy balance. Here, we show that refeeding after an overnight fast rapidly triggers proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors, leading to the production of new oligodendrocytes in the ME specifically. During this nutritional paradigm, ME perineuronal nets (PNNs), emerging regulators of ARH metabolic functions, are rapidly remodeled, and this process requires myelin regulatory factor (Myrf) in oligodendrocyte progenitors. In genetically obese ob/ob mice, nutritional regulations of ME oligodendrocyte differentiation and PNN remodeling are blunted, and enzymatic digestion of local PNN increases food intake and weight gain. We conclude that MBH PNNs are required for the maintenance of energy balance in lean mice and are remodeled in the adult ME by the nutritional control of oligodendrocyte differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanistic understanding of nascent RNAs in transcriptional control remains limited. Here, by a high sensitivity method methylation-inscribed nascent transcripts sequencing (MINT-seq), we characterized the landscapes of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on nascent RNAs. We uncover heavy but selective m6A deposition on nascent RNAs produced by transcription regulatory elements, including promoter upstream antisense RNAs and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), which positively correlates with their length, inclusion of m6A motif, and RNA abundances. m6A-eRNAs mark highly active enhancers, where they recruit nuclear m6A reader YTHDC1 to phase separate into liquid-like condensates, in a manner dependent on its C terminus intrinsically disordered region and arginine residues. The m6A-eRNA/YTHDC1 condensate co-mixes with and facilitates the formation of BRD4 coactivator condensate. Consequently, YTHDC1 depletion diminished BRD4 condensate and its recruitment to enhancers, resulting in inhibited enhancer and gene activation. We propose that chemical modifications of eRNAs together with reader proteins play broad roles in enhancer activation and gene transcriptional control.

Abstract: Summary
Coronaviruses rely on host membranes for entry, establishment of replication centers, and egress. Compounds targeting cellular membrane biology and lipid biosynthetic pathways have previously shown promise as antivirals and are actively being pursued as treatments for other conditions. Here, we test small molecule inhibitors that target the PI3 kinase VPS34 or fatty acid metabolism for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) activity. Our studies determine that compounds targeting VPS34 are potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Mechanistic studies with compounds targeting multiple steps up- and downstream of fatty acid synthase (FASN) identify the importance of triacylglycerol production and protein palmitoylation as requirements for efficient viral RNA synthesis and infectious virus production. Further, FASN knockout results in significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2 replication that can be rescued with fatty acid supplementation. Together, these studies clarify roles for VPS34 and fatty acid metabolism in SARS-CoV-2 replication and identify promising avenues for the development of countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Summary
Modular, repetitive structures are a key component of complex multicellular body plans across the tree of life. Typically, these structures are prepatterned by temporal oscillations in gene expression or signaling. Although a clock-and-wavefront mechanism was identified and plant leaf phyllotaxis arises from a Turing-type patterning for vertebrate somitogenesis and arthropod segmentation, the mechanism underlying lateral root patterning has remained elusive. To resolve this enigma, we combined computational modeling with in planta experiments. Intriguingly, auxin oscillations automatically emerge in our model from the interplay between a reflux-loop-generated auxin loading zone and stem-cell-driven growth dynamics generating periodic cell-size variations. In contrast to the clock-and-wavefront mechanism and Turing patterning, the uncovered mechanism predicts both frequency and spacing of lateral-root-forming sites to positively correlate with root meristem growth. We validate this prediction experimentally. Combined, our model and experimental results support that a reflux-and-growth patterning mechanism underlies lateral root priming.

Abstract: Summary
The exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex that regulates vesicular trafficking and scaffolds signal transduction. Key upstream components of the exocyst include monomeric RAL GTPases, which help mount cell-autonomous responses to trophic and immunogenic signals. Here, we present a quantitative proteomics-based characterization of dynamic and signal-dependent exocyst protein interactomes. Under viral infection, an Exo84 exocyst subcomplex assembles the immune kinase Protein Kinase R (PKR) together with the Hippo kinase Macrophage Stimulating 1 (MST1). PKR phosphorylates MST1 to activate Hippo signaling and inactivate Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1). By contrast, a Sec5 exocyst subcomplex recruits another immune kinase, TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which interacted with and activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). RALB was necessary and sufficient for induction of Hippo and mTOR signaling through parallel exocyst subcomplex engagement, supporting the cellular response to virus infection and oncogenic signaling. This study highlights RALB-exocyst signaling subcomplexes as mechanisms for the integrated engagement of Hippo and mTOR signaling in cells challenged by viral pathogens or oncogenic signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Although tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) maintain their ability to proliferate, persist, and eradicate tumors, they are frequently dysfunctional in situ. By performing both whole-genome CRISPR and metabolic inhibitor screens, we identify that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is required for T cell activation. NAMPT is low in TILs, and its expression is controlled by the transcriptional factor Tubby (TUB), whose activity depends on the T cell receptor-phospholipase C gamma (TCR-PLCγ) signaling axis. The intracellular level of NAD+, whose synthesis is dependent on the NAMPT-mediated salvage pathway, is also decreased in TILs. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and isotopic labeling studies confirm that NAD+ depletion led to suppressed glycolysis, disrupted mitochondrial function, and dampened ATP synthesis. Excitingly, both adoptive CAR-T and anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade mouse models demonstrate that NAD+ supplementation enhanced the tumor-killing efficacy of T cells. Collectively, this study reveals that an impaired TCR-TUB-NAMPT-NAD+ axis leads to T cell dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment, and an over-the-counter nutrient supplement of NAD+ could boost T-cell-based immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are essential for male fertility. Here, we report that mouse SSC generation is driven by a transcription factor (TF) cascade controlled by the homeobox protein, RHOX10, which acts by driving the differentiation of SSC precursors called pro-spermatogonia (ProSG). We identify genes regulated by RHOX10 in ProSG in vivo and define direct RHOX10-target genes using several approaches, including a rapid temporal induction assay: iSLAMseq. Together, these approaches identify temporal waves of RHOX10 direct targets, as well as RHOX10 secondary-target genes. Many of the RHOX10-regulated genes encode proteins with known roles in SSCs. Using an in vitro ProSG differentiation assay, we find that RHOX10 promotes mouse ProSG differentiation through a conserved transcriptional cascade involving the key germ-cell TFs DMRT1 and ZBTB16. Our study gives important insights into germ cell development and provides a blueprint for how to define TF cascades.

Abstract: MiR-200c has been reported in several types of human cancer. Nevertheless, the expression profile and biological functions of miR-200c remain uncovered papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). The expression level of miR-200c was evaluated in PTC tissues using RT-qPCR. Survival analysis was performed in a cohort of 88 PTC patients. The effects of miR-200c on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion capacities were analyzed using CCK-8 and transwell assays. Target genes of miR-200c were assessed using luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR, Western blot and rescue experiments. MiR-200c was found to be upregulated in human PTC tissues and closely associated with pN stage and distant metastasis. High expression of miR-200c was associated with poor clinical prognosis in PTC patients. Whilst overexpression of miR-200c was demonstrated to promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PTC cells; knockdown of miR-200c showed an opposite inhibitory effect. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that PTEN is a downstream target of miR-200c. Functional assays demonstrated that PTC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were promoted by miR-200c via negative regulation of PTEN. Finally, overexpression of PTEN was shown to partially reverse the tumor promoting effect of miR-200c. In conclusion, this study indicates that miR-200c is a crucial prognostic biomarker of PTC, and that targeting of miR-200c/ PTEN axis may be of therapeutic significance in PTC patients.

Abstract: Objectives
The incidence of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) induced by high fructose consumption is dramatically increasing in the world while lacking specifically therapeutic drugs. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of complement C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 (CTRP3) on fructose-induced MAFLD and its potential mechanisms.
Method
The animal models with MAFLD were built with Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats drinking 10 % fructose solution for 12 weeks. Then, specific hepatic CTRP3 overexpression was conducted by a single caudal-vein injection of CTRP3-expressing adenoviruses. Rats were sacrificed two weeks later.
Results
Drinking 10 % fructose solution for 12 weeks successfully built the rats models with MAFLD. Fructose feeding markedly decreased hepatic CTRP3 expression in rats. However, CTRP3 overexpression in liver alleviated hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia, liver function injury, intrahepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation and histological changes of hepatic steatosis in rats fed with fructose. CTRP3 overexpression also inhibited hepatic XO activity in liver and improved subsequent oxidative stress, accompanied with downregulation of gene expression of sterol-regulatory element binding protein 1c (SERBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS).
Conclusion
CTRP3 attenuates MAFLD induced by fructose, which maybe partially attribute to rescued oxidative stress related with xanthine oxidase overactivity.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1-negative factor (Nef) protein antagonizes serine incorporator 5 (SERINC5) by redirecting this potent restriction factor to the endosomes and lysosomes for degradation. However, the precise mechanism remains unclear. Using affinity purification/mass spectrometry, we identify cyclin K (CycK) and cyclin-dependent kinase 13 (CDK13) as a Nef-associated kinase complex. CycK/CDK13 phosphorylates the serine at position 360 (S360) in SERINC5, which is required for Nef downregulation of SERINC5 from the cell surface and its counteractivity of the SERINC5 antiviral activity. To understand the role of S360 phosphorylation, we generate chimeric proteins between CD8 and SERINC5 to study their response to Nef. Nef not only downregulates but, importantly, also binds to this chimera in an S360-dependent manner. Thus, S360 phosphorylation increases interactions between Nef and SERINC5 and initiates the destruction of SERINC5 by the endocytic machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Filopodia assemble unique integrin-adhesion complexes to sense the extracellular matrix. However, the mechanisms of integrin regulation in filopodia are poorly defined. Here, we report that active integrins accumulate at the tip of myosin-X (MYO10)-positive filopodia, while inactive integrins are uniformly distributed. We identify talin and MYO10 as the principal integrin activators in filopodia. In addition, deletion of MYO10’s FERM domain, or mutation of its β1-integrin-binding residues, reveals MYO10 as facilitating integrin activation, but not transport, in filopodia. However, MYO10’s isolated FERM domain alone cannot activate integrins, potentially because of binding to both integrin tails. Finally, because a chimera construct generated by swapping MYO10-FERM by talin-FERM enables integrin activation in filopodia, our data indicate that an integrin-binding FERM domain coupled to a myosin motor is a core requirement for integrin activation in filopodia. Therefore, we propose a two-step integrin activation model in filopodia: receptor tethering by MYO10 followed by talin-mediated integrin activation.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin organization plays a crucial role in tissue homeostasis. Heterochromatin relaxation and consequent unscheduled mobilization of transposable elements (TEs) are emerging as key contributors of aging and aging-related pathologies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cancer. However, the mechanisms governing heterochromatin maintenance or its relaxation in pathological conditions remain poorly understood. Here we show that PIN1, the only phosphorylation-specific cis/trans prolyl isomerase, whose loss is associated with premature aging and AD, is essential to preserve heterochromatin. We demonstrate that this PIN1 function is conserved from Drosophila to humans and prevents TE mobilization-dependent neurodegeneration and cognitive defects. Mechanistically, PIN1 maintains nuclear type-B Lamin structure and anchoring function for heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α). This mechanism prevents nuclear envelope alterations and heterochromatin relaxation under mechanical stress, which is a key contributor to aging-related pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy is a promising curative approach for a variety of immune-mediated conditions. CRISPR-based genome editing allows precise insertion of transgenes through homology-directed repair, but its use in human Tregs has been limited. We report an optimized protocol for CRISPR-mediated gene knockin in human Tregs with high-yield expansion. To establish a benchmark of human Treg dysfunction, we target the master transcription factor FOXP3 in naive and memory Tregs. Although FOXP3-ablated Tregs upregulate cytokine expression, effects on suppressive capacity in vitro manifest slowly and primarily in memory Tregs. Moreover, FOXP3-ablated Tregs retain their characteristic protein, transcriptional, and DNA methylation profile. Instead, FOXP3 maintains DNA methylation at regions enriched for AP-1 binding sites. Thus, although FOXP3 is important for human Treg development, it has a limited role in maintaining mature Treg identity. Optimized gene knockin with human Tregs will enable mechanistic studies and the development of tailored, next-generation Treg cell therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The CD155/TIGIT axis can be co-opted during immune evasion in chronic viral infections and cancer. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy, and immune-based strategies to combat this disease have been largely unsuccessful to date. We corroborate prior reports that a substantial portion of PDAC harbors predicted high-affinity MHC class I-restricted neoepitopes and extend these findings to advanced/metastatic disease. Using multiple preclinical models of neoantigen-expressing PDAC, we demonstrate that intratumoral neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells adopt multiple states of dysfunction, resembling those in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of PDAC patients. Mechanistically, genetic and/or pharmacologic modulation of the CD155/TIGIT axis was sufficient to promote immune evasion in autochthonous neoantigen-expressing PDAC. Finally, we demonstrate that the CD155/TIGIT axis is critical in maintaining immune evasion in PDAC and uncover a combination immunotherapy (TIGIT/PD-1 co-blockade plus CD40 agonism) that elicits profound anti-tumor responses in preclinical models, now poised for clinical evaluation.

Abstract: Objective
To study the possible effects of miR-26b-5p on fibroblast-like synovial cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA-FLS) through targeting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2).
Methods
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect miR-26b-5p and EZH2 expressions in synovial tissues of RA patients and healthy controls. Dual luciferase reporter assay was adopted to verify the targeting relationship between miR-26b-5p and EZH2. RA-FLS was divided into Blank, mimics NC, mimics, NC siRNA, EZH2 siRNA and inhibitors + EZH2 siRNA groups, followed by the assessment of proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. The expression of genes and proteins in RA-FLS was tested by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively.
Results
MiR-26b-5p expression was lower, while EZH2 expression was higher in synovial tissue of RA patients than healthy controls; and miR-26b-5p was negatively correlated with the EZH2 in synovial tissue of RA patients, which were both related with disease activities. MiR-26b-5p can target EZH2 in RA-FLS. In vitro, miR-26b-5p mimics down-regulated EZH2 expression in RA-FLS. Compared with EZH2 siRNA group, the miR-26b-5p expression in inhibitors + EZH2 siRNA group was reduced, but EZH2 expression was increased. EZH2 siRNA inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of RA-FLS, promoted cell apoptosis, and inhibited the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, MMP-2, MMP-9, which were reversed by miR-26b-5p inhibitor.
Conclusion
MiR-26b-5p may affect the biological characteristics of RA-FLS via targeting EZH2, including proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration, as well as the secretion of cytokines, thus playing a potential therapeutic role in RA.

Abstract: Summary
Recombinant bacterial colonization plays an indispensable role in disease prevention, alleviation, and treatment. Successful application mainly depends on whether bacteria can efficiently spatiotemporally colonize the host gut. However, a primary limitation of existing methods is the lack of precise spatiotemporal regulation, resulting in uncontrolled methods that are less effective. Herein, we design upconversion microgels (UCMs) to convert near-infrared light (NIR) into blue light to activate recombinant light-responsive bacteria (Lresb) in vivo, where autocrine “functional cellular glues” made of adhesive proteins assist Lresb inefficiently colonizing the gut. The programmable engineering platform is further developed for the controlled and effective colonization of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) in the gut. The colonizing bacteria effectively alleviate DSS-induced colitis in mice. We anticipate that this approach could facilitate the clinical application of engineered microbial therapeutics to accurately and effectively regulate host health.

Abstract: Summary
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are RNA effectors with key roles in maintaining genome integrity and promoting fertility in metazoans. In Caenorhabditis elegans loss of piRNAs leads to a transgenerational sterility phenotype. The plethora of piRNAs and their ability to silence transcripts with imperfect complementarity have raised several (non-exclusive) models for the underlying drivers of sterility. Here, we report the extranuclear and transferable nature of the sterility driver, its suppression via mutations disrupting the endogenous RNAi and poly-uridylation machinery, and copy-number amplification at the ribosomal DNA locus. In piRNA-deficient animals, several small interfering RNA (siRNA) populations become increasingly overabundant in the generations preceding loss of germline function, including ribosomal siRNAs (risiRNAs). A concomitant increase in uridylated sense rRNA fragments suggests that poly-uridylation may potentiate RNAi-mediated gene silencing of rRNAs. We conclude that loss of the piRNA machinery allows for unchecked amplification of siRNA populations, originating from abundant highly structured RNAs, to deleterious levels.

Abstract: Global knockout of the BK channel has been proven to affect bone formation; however, whether it directly affects osteoblast differentiation and the mechanism are elusive. In the current study, we further investigated the role of BK channels in bone development and explored whether BK channels impacted the differentiation and proliferation of osteoblasts via the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrated that knockout of Kcnma1 disrupted the osteogenesis of osteoblasts and inhibited the stabilization of β-catenin. Western blot analysis showed that the protein levels of Axin1 and USP7 increased when Kcnma1 was deficient. Together, this study confirmed that BK ablation decreased bone mass via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings also showed that USP7 might have the ability to stabilize the activity of Axin1, which would increase the degradation of β-catenin in osteoblasts.
