Abstract: Myoblast differentiation is an essential process for the control of muscle regeneration. However, the intrinsic mechanisms underlying this dynamic process are still not well clarified. Herein, we identified transglutaminase type 2 (TGM2) as a novel regulator of muscle differentiation and regeneration in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, knockdown of TGM2 suppresses whereas overexpression of TGM2 promotes myoblast differentiation in differentiating C2C12 cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that TGM2 promotes C2C12 myoblast differentiation via enhancing GPR56 mediated activation of the mTOR signaling. Additionally, lentivirus mediated knockdown of TGM2 hinders the regeneration of muscles in a BaCl2 induced skeletal muscle injury model of mice. Finally, we found that both TGM2 and activation of the mTOR signaling are up-regulated in muscles of patients with immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), especially in the regenerating myofibers. Collectively, our research demonstrates that TGM2 positively regulates muscle differentiation and regeneration through facilitating the myogenic mTOR signaling, which might be a potential target of therapy for skeletal muscle injury.

Abstract: Genome stability depends on chromosome congression and alignment during cell division. Kinesin-7 CENP-E is critical for kinetochore-microtubule attachment and chromosome alignment, which contribute to genome stability in mitosis. However, the functions and mechanisms of CENP-E in the meiotic division of male spermatocytes remain largely unknown. In this study, by combining the use of chemical inhibitors, siRNA-mediated gene knockdown, immunohistochemistry, and high-resolution microscopy, we have found that CENP-E inhibition results in chromosome misalignment and metaphase arrest in dividing spermatocyte during meiosis. Strikingly, we have revealed that CENP-E regulates spindle organization in metaphase I spermatocytes and cultured GC-2 spd cells. CENP-E depletion leads to spindle elongation, chromosome misalignment, and chromosome instability in spermatocytes. Together, these findings indicate that CENP-E mediates the kinetochore recruitment of BubR1, spindle assembly checkpoint and chromosome alignment in dividing spermatocytes, which finally contribute to faithful chromosome segregation and chromosome stability in the male meiotic division.

Abstract: Emerging evidences suggest abundant expression of Carboxy terminus of Hsc70 Interacting Protein or CHIP (alias STIP1 Homology and U–box Containing Protein 1 or STUB1) in colorectal carcinoma, but the mechanistic detail of this augmented expression pattern is unclear. The signature driver of canonical Wnt pathway, β-catenin, and its co-activator RNA helicase p68, are also overexpressed in colorectal carcinoma. In this study, we describe a novel mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin and p68 mediated transcriptional activation of CHIP gene leading to enhanced proliferation of colorectal carcinoma cells. Bioinformatic analyses reconfirmed an elevated CHIP expression level in colorectal carcinoma datasets. Wnt3A treatment and pharmacological activation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway resulted in increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin, augmenting CHIP expression. Likewise, immunoblotting and Real time PCR following overexpression and knockdown of β-catenin and p68 demonstrated upregulated and downregulated CHIP expression, respectively, at both mRNA and protein levels. p68 along with β-catenin were found to occupy Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4) binding sites on endogenous CHIP promoter and regulate its transcription. After cloning CHIP promoter, the increased and decreased promoter activities of CHIP induced by overexpression and knockdown of either β-catenin or p68 further confirmed transcriptional regulation of CHIP gene by Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade. Finally, enhanced cellular propagation and migration of colorectal carcinoma cells induced by ‘Wnt/β-catenin-p68-CHIP’ axis established the significance of this pathway in oncogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report elucidating the mechanistic details of transcriptional regulation of CHIP (STUB1) gene expression.

Abstract: Membraneless organelles have emerged during the evolution of eukaryotic cells as intracellular domains in which multiple proteins organize into complex structures to perform specialized functions without the need of a lipid bilayer compartment. Here we describe the perinuclear space of eukaryotic cells as a highly organized network of cytoskeletal filaments that facilitates assembly of biomolecular condensates. Using bioinformatic analyses, we show that the perinuclear proteome is enriched in intrinsic disorder with several proteins predicted to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. We also analyze immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy images showing the association between the nucleus and other organelles, such as mitochondria and lysosomes, or the labeling of specific proteins within the perinuclear region of cells. Altogether our data support the existence of a perinuclear dense sub-micron region formed by a well-organized three-dimensional network of structural and signaling proteins, including several proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions with phase behavior. This network of filamentous cytoskeletal proteins extends a few micrometers from the nucleus, contributes to local crowding, and organizes the movement of molecular complexes within the perinuclear space. Our findings take a key step towards understanding how membraneless regions within eukaryotic cells can serve as hubs for biomolecular condensates assembly, in particular the perinuclear space. Finally, evaluation of the disease context of the perinuclear proteins revealed that alterations in their expression can lead to several pathological conditions, and neurological disorders and cancer are among the most frequent.

PAR2 blockade reverses osimertinib resistance in non-small-cell lung cancer cells via attenuating ERK-mediated EMT and PD-L1 expression,

Abstract: Osimertinib, as the third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), is a first-line molecularly targeted drug for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the emergence of therapeutic resistance to osimertinib markedly impairs its efficiency and efficacy, leading to the failure of clinical applications. Novel molecular targets and drugs are urgently needed for reversing osimertinib resistance in NSCLC. Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) that belongs to a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors can stimulate the transactivation of EGFR to regulate multiple cellular signalling, actively participating in tumour progression. This study firstly discovered that PAR2 expression was notably enhanced when NSCLC cells became resistant to osimertinib. A PAR2 inhibitor facilitated osimertinib to attenuate EGFR transactivation, ERK phosphorylation, EMT and PD-L1 expression which were associated to osimertinib resistance. The combination of the PAR2 inhibitor and osimertinib also notably blocked cell viability, migration, 3D sphere formation and in vivo tumour growth whereas osimertinib itself lost such inhibitory effects in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Importantly, this reversal effect of PAR2 blockade was uncovered to depend on ERK-mediated EMT and PD-L1, since inhibition of β-arrestin or ERK, which could be modulated by PAR2, sensitized osimertinib to prevent EMT, PD-L1 expression and consequently overcame osimertinib resistance. Thus, this study demonstrated that PAR2 antagonism could limit ERK-mediated EMT and immune checkpoints, consequently attenuating EGFR transactivation and reactivate osimertinib. It suggested that PAR2 may be a novel drug target for osimertinib resistance, and PAR2 inhibition may be a promising strategy candidate for reversing EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC.

Abstract: Breast cancer is primarily classified into ductal and lobular types, as well as into noninvasive and invasive cancer. Invasive cancer involves lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis. In breast cancer patients with distant metastases, a neutrophil-derived serine protease; cathepsin G (Cat G), is highly expressed in breast cancer cells. Cat G induces cell migration and multicellular aggregation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells; however, the mechanism is not clear. Recently, platelet-activating factor (PAF)-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), the enzyme responsible for PAF degradation, was reported to be overexpressed in some tumor types, including pancreatic and breast cancers. In this study, we investigated whether PAF-AH is involved in Cat G-induced aggregation and migration of MCF-7 cells. We first showed that Cat G increased PAF-AH activity and elevated PAFAH1B2 expression in MCF-7 cells. The elevated expression of PAFAH1B2 was also observed in human breast cancer tissue specimens by immunohistochemical analysis. Furthermore, knockdown of PAFAH1B2 in MCF-7 cells suppressed the cell migration and aggregation induced by low concentrations, but not high concentrations, of Cat G. Carbamoyl PAF (cPAF), a nonhydrolyzable PAF analog, completely suppressed Cat G-induced migration of MCF-7 cells. In addition, PAF receptor (PAFR) inhibition induced cell migration of MCF-7 cells even in the absence of Cat G, suggesting that Cat G suppresses the activation of PAFR through enhanced PAF degradation due to elevated expression of PAFAH1B2 and thereby induces malignant phenotypes in MCF-7 cells. Our findings may lead to a novel therapeutic modality for treating breast cancer by modulating the activity of Cat G/PAF signaling.

Abstract: Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a common pathway of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is closely related to the progression of CKD. LMCD1, acting as an intermediary, has been reported to play a role in cardiac fibrosis. However, its role in renal fibrosis is yet to be deciphered. Based on the GEO database, we found the expression of LMCD1 is increased in kidney tissues of CKD patients and in human proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells treated with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), suggesting that LMCD1 may be involved in tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Herein, we investigated the role of LMCD1 in mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and in TGF-β1-stimulated HK-2 cells. In the UUO model, the expression of LMCD1 was upregulated. UUO-induced renal histopathological changes were mitigated by knockdown of LMCD1. LMCD1 silence alleviated renal interstitial fibrosis in UUO mice by decreasing the expression of TGF-β1, fibronectin, collagen I, and collagen III. LMCD1 deficiency suppressed cell apoptosis in kidney to prevent UUO-triggered renal injury. Furthermore, LMCD1 deficiency blocked the activation of ERK signaling in UUO mice. In vitro, LMCD1 was upregulated in HK-2 cells after TGF-β1 stimulation. LMCD1 silence abrogated TGF-β1-mediated upregulation of fibrotic genes. Treatment of HK-2 cells with ERK-specific inhibitor SCH772984 and agonist TPA validated LMCD1 exerted its function via activating ERK signaling. Together, our findings suggest that inhibition of LMCD1 protects against renal interstitial fibrosis by impeding ERK activation.

Abstract: Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a serine/threonine kinase involving lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease. However, its role in atherogenesis has yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to observe the impact of PLK1 on macrophage lipid accumulation and atherosclerosis development and to explore the underlying mechanisms. We found a significant reduction of PLK1 expression in lipid-loaded macrophages and atherosclerosis model mice. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of PLK1 promoted cholesterol efflux and inhibited lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. Mechanistic analysis revealed that PLK1 stimulated the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)/liver X receptor α (LXRα) pathway and up-regulation of ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 expression. Injection of lentiviral vector expressing PLK1 increased reverse cholesterol transport, improved plasma lipid profiles and decreased atherosclerotic lesion area in apoE-deficient mice fed a Western diet. PLK1 overexpression also facilitated AMPK and HSL phosphorylation and enhanced the expression of PPARγ, LXRα, ABCA1, ABCG1 and LPL in the aorta. In summary, these data suggest that PLK1 inhibits macrophage lipid accumulation and mitigates atherosclerosis by promoting ABCA1- and ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux via the AMPK/PPARγ/LXRα pathway.

Abstract: The ubiquitous secondary messengers, Ca2+ and cAMP, play a vital role in shaping a diverse array of physiological processes. More significantly, accumulating evidence over the past several decades underpin extensive crosstalk between these two canonical messengers in discrete sub-cellular nanodomains across various cell types. Within such specialized nanodomains, each messenger fine-tunes signaling to maintain homeostasis by manipulating the activities of cellular machinery accountable for the metabolism or activity of the complementary pathway. Interaction between these messengers is ensured by scaffolding proteins which tether components of the signaling machinery in close proximity. Disruption of dynamic communications between Ca2+ and cAMP at these loci consequently is linked to several pathological conditions. This review summarizes recent novel mechanisms underlying effective crosstalk between Ca2+ and cAMP in such nanodomains.

Abstract: MARKs kinase belongs to an AMPK-related family kinase plays a critical role in tumor progression, but its exact role and contribution of four different isoforms remain largely ambiguous. In this study, we used a clinical dataset compiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GEO revealed that MARK2 and MARK4 expressions were significantly upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, expressions of MARK2/4 were highly appeared in advanced stages and associated with the low survival rate of NSCLC patients. Functional assays demonstrated that MARK2/4 deletion or MARKs inhibition significantly suppressed aerobic glycolysis and cell growth in NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, MARK2/4 stimulates the mTOR/HIF-1α pathway and subsequently alleviates AMPK activity via physically associate with Raptor and AMPKα1, thereby facilitating aerobic glycolysis and cell growth in NSCLC cells. However, these effects were markedly reversed by MARKs inhibitor 39621, or MARK2/4 deletion, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, or AMPK activator AICAR. Together, the data demonstrated that MARK2/4 exerts its oncogenic effects by facilitating metabolic reprogramming in NSCLC cells. Therefore, MARK2/4 might be a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic steatosis (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) are two highly prevalent human disorders for which therapy remains suboptimal. Bile acids play an essential role in regulating liver metabolism, and several bile acids-based therapy are currently investigated for their potential therapeutic efficacy in NAFLD/NASH. Bile acids exert their functions, at least in part, by modulating two main receptors the Farnesoid-x-receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled receptor, GPBAR1. In the present study we have compared the pharmacological effects of two bile acids, the ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and its derivative norUDCA, in a model of NAFLD/NASH induced by feeding mice with a Western diet for 12 weeks. The results of these studies demonstrated that both UDCA and norUDCA protected against development of steatosis and fibrosis, but did not reduce the hepatocytes ballooning nor the development of a pro-atherogenic lipid profile. Both agents reduced liver lipogenesis and ameliorated insulin sensitivity and adipocytes signaling as shown by increased expression of adiponectin. Mechanistically, UDCA acts as weak GPBAR1 agonist, while norUDCA exerted no effect on both GPBAR1 and FXR. In vivo administration of UDCA resets bile acid synthesis and promotes a shift toward bile acids species that are GPBAR1 agonists, UDCA, TUDCA and hyodeoxycholic acid, and increases GLP1 expression in the ileum. In contrast norUDCA is poorly metabolized exerting a minimal impact on GPBAR1 signaling. Together, these data, highlight the potential role of UDCA and norUDCA in treating of NAFLD, though these beneficial effects are supported by different mechanisms.

Abstract: Ferroptosis is a unique iron-dependent cell death mechanism characterized by the generation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells, which leads to mitochondrial metabolic dysregulation. However, how could the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) modulates ferroptosis remains unclear. Thus, by integrating multiple algorithms, we revealed the novel functional and immune patterns of the ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in breast cancer. Five prognostic FRGs were finally selected for the prognostic signature and four of which were identified as the independent biomarkers for immunotherapies. The consensus cluster analysis illustrated the FRGs were characterized by the metabolism dysfunction and immune infiltration cells, meanwhile, these FRGs have the same stem cell characteristics and response efficacy to the immunotherapies. In conclusion, a comprehensive analysis of the FRGs in breast cancer was conducted to develop a prognostic gene signature. Functional and immunological evidence of vulnerabilities in the interaction between ferroptosis and the TIME was also revealed. Further data and research are required.

Abstract: Iron‑sulfur (Fe-S) clusters have been shown to play important roles in various cellular physiological process. Iron‑sulfur cluster assembly 2 (ISCA2) is a vital component of the [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly machine. Several studies have shown that ISCA2 is highly expressed during erythroid differentiation. However, the role and specific regulatory mechanisms of ISCA2 in erythroid differentiation and erythroid cell growth remain unclear. RNA interference was used to deplete ISCA2 expression in human erythroid leukemia K562 cells. The proliferation, apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation ability of the cells were assessed. We show that knockdown of ISCA2 has profound effects on [4Fe-4S] cluster formation, diminishing mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and mitochondrial damage, inhibiting cell proliferation. Excessive ROS can inhibit the activity of cytoplasmic aconitase (ACO1) and promote ACO1, a bifunctional protein, to perform its iron-regulating protein 1(IRP1) function, thus inhibiting the expression of 5′-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2), which is a key enzyme in heme synthesis. Deficiency of ISCA2 results in the accumulation of iron divalent. In addition, the combination of excessive ferrous iron and ROS may lead to damage of the ACO1 cluster and higher IRP1 function. In brief, ISCA2 deficiency inhibits heme synthesis and erythroid differentiation by double indirect downregulation of ALAS2 expression. We conclude that ISCA2 is essential for normal functioning of mitochondria, and is necessary for erythroid differentiation and cell proliferation.

Abstract: Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is a pivotal regulator of redox homeostasis, while dysregulation of redox homeostasis is a hallmark for cancer cells. Thus, there is considerable potential to inhibit the aberrantly upregulated TrxR in cancer cells to discover selective cancer therapeutic agents. Nevertheless, the structural types of TrxR inhibitors presented currently are still relatively limited. We herein report that PACMA 31, previously reported to inhibit protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), is a potent TrxR inhibitor. PACMA 31 possesses a pharmacophore scaffold that is structurally different from the announced TrxR inhibitors and exhibits effective cytotoxicity against cervical cancer cells. Our results reveal that PACMA 31 selectively inhibits TrxR over the related glutathione reductase (GR) and in the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH). Further studies with mutant enzyme and molecular docking suggest that the propynamide fragment of PACMA 31 interacts covalently with the selenocysteine residue of TrxR. Moreover, PACMA 31 effectively and selectively curbs TrxR activity in cells and further stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at low micromolar concentrations, which in turn triggers the accumulation of oxidized thioredoxin (Trx) and GSSG in cells. Follow-up studies demonstrate that PACMA 31 targets TrxR in cells to induce oxidative stress-mediated cancer cell apoptosis. Our results provide a new structural type of TrxR inhibitor that may serve as a useful probe for investigating the biology of TrxR-implicated pathways, and uncover a new target of PACMA 31 that contributes to it becoming a candidate for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Although the protective effects of Chlamydia psittaci plasmid-encoded protein CPSIT_P7 as vaccine antigens to against chlamydial infection have been confirmed in our previous study, the function and mechanism of CPSIT_P7 inducing innate immunity in the antibacterial response remain unknown. Here, we found that plasmid protein CPSIT_P7 could induce M1 macrophage polarization upregulating the genes of the surface molecule CD86, proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β), and antibacterial effector NO synthase 2 (iNOS). During M1 macrophage polarization, macrophages acquire phagocytic and microbicidal competence, which promotes the host antibacterial response. As we observed that CPSIT_P7-induced M1 macrophages could partially reduce the infected mice pulmonary Chlamydia psittaci load. Furthermore, CPSIT_P7 induced M1 macrophage polarization through the TLR4-mediated MAPK and NF-κB pathways. Collectively, our results highlight the effect of CPSIT_P7 on macrophage polarization and provide new insights into new prevention and treatment strategies for chlamydial infection.

Abstract: Despite the availability of a myriad targeted treatments, resistance and treatment failures remains common in cancer treatment. Moreover, the high cost of targeted antibodies excludes a large cohort of patients from their benefits. In this context, copper-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines were evaluated as alternative drug candidates against two common leukaemias, represented by HL-60 and K562 cells. A previous study identified JD88(21), JD47(29) and JD49(28) to be active against these cell lines with IC50 values between 1.9 and 6 μM and low leukocyte toxicity. To better understand their mechanism of action, their mode of cell death, effects on expression of apoptotic regulatory proteins and their respective genes were investigated. In both cell lines, the copper-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines, at IC75 concentrations, caused membrane blebbing, raised phosphatidyl-serine levels on cell membranes and increased caspase-3 activity. A loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-9, combined with poor caspase-8 activity indicated activation of intrinsic apoptosis. Apoptotic proteome analysis showed that the copper-imidazo[1,2-a] pyridines elevated protein levels of pro-apoptotic Bax and Smac/DIABLO in both cell lines, confirming their importance in apoptotic cell death. Conversely, though survivin was increased, this was counteracted by high levels of HTRA2/Omi expression. Effects on apoptotic regulatory proteins Bad, Bcl-2, XIAP and cIAP-1 was inconsistent between the copper-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines and between the two cell lines, suggesting that the effect of the complexes was modulated by the molecular signature of each cell line. Analysis of mRNA transcripts showed a poor correlation between mRNA levels and associated proteins, implying that copper-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines compromised protein synthesis and degradation.

Abstract: Calpain-10 (CAPN10) belongs to the calpain superfamily. Genetic polymorphisms of the CAPN10 gene are associated with susceptibility to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although the role of CAPN10 in the pathophysiology of diabetes has been extensively investigated, its biochemical properties are largely unknown. In this report, we made the surprising discovery that CAPN10 cDNA transcripts are subject to cryptic splicing and unexpected protein products were expressed. The same set of splicing products was reproducibly detected in four types of cultured cells including the primary culture of mouse myoblast. At least, one of the products was identical to a natural splicing variant. Sequence analysis of the splicing potential of CAPN10 cDNA, together with mutagenesis studies, resulted in the identification of a powerful splicing acceptor site at the junction of the sequences encoded by exons 9 and 10. We successfully extended the analysis to create expression construct resistant to splicing for both human and mouse CAPN10. The construct allowed us to analyze two major CAPN10 isoforms and reveal their difference in substrate proteolysis and potential cell functions. These results demonstrate that proteins produced from cDNA do not necessarily reflect the original nucleotide sequence. We provide insight into the property of recombinantly expressed CAPN10 proteins in cultured cells circumventing unexpected protein products.

Abstract: Calpain-5 (CAPN5) is a member of the calpain family of calcium-activated neutral thiol proteases. CAPN5 is partly membrane associated, despite its lack of a transmembrane domain. Unlike classical calpains, CAPN5 contains a C-terminal C2 domain. C2 domains often have affinity to lipids, mediating membrane association. We recently reported that the C2 domain of CAPN5 was essential for its membrane association and the activation of its autolytic activity. However, despite the removal of the C2 domain by autolysis, the N-terminal fragment of CAPN5 remained membrane associated. S-acylation, also referred to as S-palmitoylation, is a reversible post-translational lipid modification of cysteine residues that promotes membrane association of soluble proteins. In the present study several S-acylated cysteine residues were identified in CAPN5 with the acyl-PEG exchange method. Data reported here demonstrate that CAPN5 is S-acylated on up to three cysteine residues including Cys-4 and Cys-512, and likely Cys-507. The D589N mutation in a potential calcium binding loop within the C2 domain interfered with the S-acylation of CAPN5, likely preventing initial membrane association. Mutating specific cysteine residues of CAPN5 interfered with both its membrane association and the activation of CAPN5 autolysis. Taken together, our results suggest that the S-acylation of CAPN5 is critical for its membrane localization which appears to favor its enzymatic activity.

Abstract: The extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates cell behavior through signal transduction and provides a suitable place for cell survival. As one of the major components of the extracellular matrix, type I collagen is involved in regulating cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. We present a system in which 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells are induced for adipogenic differentiation on type I collagen coated dishes. Our previous study has found that type I collagen inhibits adipogenic differentiation via YAP activation. Here we further reveal that type I collagen inactivates autophagy by up-regulating mTOR activity via the YAP pathway. Under collagen-coating conditions, co-localization of lysosomes with mTOR was increased and the level of downstream protein p-S6K was elevated, accompanied by a decrease in the level of autophagy. Autophagy is negatively correlated with adipogenesis under type I collagen coating. Through the YAP-autophagy axis, type I collagen improves glycolipid metabolism accompanied by increased mitochondrial content, enhanced glucose uptake, reduced release of free fatty acids (FFAs) and decreased intracellular lipid accumulation. Our findings provide insight into the strategy for dealing with obesity: Type I collagen or the drugs with inhibitory effects on autophagy or YAP, have a potential to accelerate the energy metabolism of adipose tissue, so as to better maintain the homeostasis of glucose and lipids in the body, which can be used for achieving weight loss.

A splicing factor phosphorylated by protein kinase A is increased in HL60 cells treated with retinoic acid,

Abstract: Retinoic acid (RA) induces the differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells into granulocytic cells and inhibits proliferation. Certain of actions of RA are mediated by RA nuclear receptors that regulate gene expression. However, it is also known that direct protein modification by RA (retinoylation) can occur. One such retinoylated protein in HL60 cells is a regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), which is increased in the nucleus following RA treatment and which then increases phosphorylation of other nuclear proteins. However, a complete understanding of which nuclear proteins are phosphorylated is lacking. In the current study, we employed mass spectrometry to identify one of the PKA-phosphorylated proteins as a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SF2, SRSF1). We found that RA treatment increased the level of PKA-phosphorylated SF2 but decreased the level of SF2. While SF2 regulates myelogenous cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1, anti-apoptotic factor), RA treatment reduced the level of Mcl-1L (full-length Mcl-1 long) and increased the level of Mcl-1S (Mcl-1 short; a short splicing variant of the Mcl-1). Furthermore, treatment with a PKA inhibitor reversed these effects on Mcl-1 and inhibited RA-induced cell differentiation. In contrast, treatment with a Mcl-1L inhibitor enhanced RA-induced cell differentiation. These results indicate that RA activates PKA in the nucleus, increases phosphorylation of SF2, raises levels of Mcl-1S and lowers levels of Mcl-1L, resulting in the induction of differentiation. RA-modified PKA may play an important role in inducing cell differentiation and suppressing cell proliferation.

PCSK9 deficiency results in a specific shedding of excess LDLR in female mice only: Role of hepatic cholesterol,

Abstract: PCSK9 promotes the lysosomal degradation of cell surface LDL receptor (LDLR). We analyzed how excess LDLR generated by PCSK9 deficiency is differently handled in male and female mice to possibly unveil the mechanism leading to the lower efficacy of PCSK9 mAb on LDL-cholesterol levels in women. Analysis of intact or ovariectomized PCSK9 knockout (KO) mice supplemented with placebo or 17β-estradiol (E2) demonstrated that female, but not male mice massively shed the soluble ectodomain of the LDLR in the plasma. Liver-specific PCSK9 KO or alirocumab-treated WT mice exhibit the same pattern. This shedding is distinct from the basal one and is inhibited by ZLDI-8, a metalloprotease inhibitor pointing at ADAM10/ADAM17. In PCSK9 KO female mice, ZLDI-8 raises by 80 % the LDLR liver content in a few hours. This specific shedding is likely cholesterol-dependent: it is prevented in PCSK9 KO male mice that exhibit low intra-hepatic cholesterol levels without activating SREBP-2, and enhanced by mevalonate or high cholesterol feeding, or by E2 known to stimulate cholesterol synthesis via the estrogen receptor-α. Liver transcriptomics demonstrates that critically low liver cholesterol in ovariectomized female or knockout male mice also hampers the cholesterol-dependent G2/M transition of the cell cycle. Finally, higher levels of shed LDLR were measured in the plasma of women treated with PCSK9 mAb. PCSK9 knockout female mice hormonally sustain cholesterol synthesis and shed excess LDLR, seemingly like women. In contrast, male mice rely on high surface LDLR to replenish their stocks, despite 80 % lower circulating LDL.

Abstract: Tinagl1 (tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen-like 1) is a matricellular protein involved in female infertility and breast cancer tumorigenesis. In this study, we analyzed the function of Tinagl1 in skeletal muscle using knockout mice and cell experiments. Although primary myoblasts isolated from Tinagl1-decifient (Tinagl1−/−) mice differentiated into normal myotubes, and treatment with recombinant Tinagl1 did not affect the proliferation or differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, Tinagl1−/− mice exhibited reduced body mass and calf muscle weights compared to the control group (Tinagl1flox/flox). Furthermore, Tinagl1−/− mice showed myofibers with centrally located nuclei, which is a morphological marker of regenerating muscle or myopathy. In addition, the capillary density in the soleus muscle of Tinagl1−/− mice showed a decreasing trend compared to that of the control group. Importantly, si-RNA-mediated knockdown of TINAGL1 resulted in reduced tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), whereas treatment with Tinagl1 promoted tube formation. Immunoblot analysis revealed that Tinagl1 activates ERK signaling in both HUVECs and C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes, which are involved in the regulation of myogenic differentiation, proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenesis. Our results demonstrate that Tinagl1 may be required for normal muscle and capillary development through the activation of ERK signaling.

Abstract: N-Acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs), a minor class of membrane glycerophospholipids, accumulate along with their bioactive metabolites, N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) during ischemia. NAPEs can be formed through N-acylation of phosphatidylethanolamine by cytosolic phospholipase A2ε (cPLA2ε, also known as PLA2G4E) or members of the phospholipase A and acyltransferase (PLAAT) family. However, the enzyme responsible for the NAPE production in brain ischemia has not yet been clarified. Here, we investigated a possible role of cPLA2ε using cPLA2ε-deficient (Pla2g4e−/−) mice. As analyzed with brain homogenates of wild-type mice, the age dependency of Ca2+-dependent NAPE-forming activity showed a bell-shape pattern being the highest at the first week of postnatal life, and the activity was completely abolished in Pla2g4e−/− mice. However, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the NAPE levels of normal brain were similar between wild-type and Pla2g4e−/− mice. In contrast, post-mortal accumulations of NAPEs and most species of NAEs were only observed in decapitated brains of wild-type mice. These results suggested that cPLA2ε is responsible for Ca2+-dependent formation of NAPEs in the brain as well as the accumulation of NAPEs and NAEs during ischemia, while other enzyme(s) appeared to be involved in the maintenance of basal NAPE levels.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle that performs several key functions such as protein synthesis and folding, lipid metabolism and calcium homeostasis. When these functions are disrupted, such as upon protein misfolding, ER stress occurs. ER stress can trigger adaptive responses to restore proper functioning such as activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In certain cells, the free fatty acid palmitate has been shown to induce the UPR. Here, we examined the effects of palmitate on UPR gene expression in a human neuronal cell line and compared it with thapsigargin, a known depletor of ER calcium and trigger of the UPR. We used a Gaussia luciferase-based reporter to assess how palmitate treatment affects ER proteostasis and calcium homeostasis in the cells. We also investigated how ER calcium depletion by thapsigargin affects lipid membrane composition by performing mass spectrometry on subcellular fractions and compared this to palmitate. Surprisingly, palmitate treatment did not activate UPR despite prominent changes to membrane phospholipids. Conversely, thapsigargin induced a strong UPR, but did not significantly change the membrane lipid composition in subcellular fractions. In summary, our data demonstrate that changes in membrane lipid composition and disturbances in ER calcium homeostasis have a minimal influence on each other in neuronal cells. These data provide new insight into the adaptive interplay of lipid homeostasis and proteostasis in the cell.

Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate cells' biological landscape and focus on the expression profile of individual cells. Major advantage of this approach is an analysis of highly complex and heterogeneous cell populations, such as a specific subpopulation of T helper cells that are known to differentiate into distinct subpopulations. The need for distinguishing the specific expression profile is even more important considering the T cell plasticity. However, importantly, the universal pipelines for single-cell analysis are usually not sufficient for every cell type. Here, the aims are to analyze the diversity of T cell phenotypes employing classical in vitro cytokine-mediated differentiation of human T cells isolated from human peripheral blood by single-cell transcriptomic approach with support of labelled antibodies and a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis using combination of Seurat, Nebulosa, GGplot and others. The results showed high expression similarities between Th1 and Th17 phenotype and very distinct Th2 expression profile. In a case of Th2 highly specific marker genes SPINT2, TRIB3 and CST7 were expressed. Overall, our results demonstrate how donor difference, Th plasticity and cell cycle influence the expression profiles of distinct T cell populations. The results could help to better understand the importance of each step of the analysis when working with T cell single-cell data and observe the results in a more practical way by using our analyzed datasets.

Abstract: Fragment size distribution, the important biological properties of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), provides useful information required for diagnostic assay development. However, besides methodological discrepancies, it varies due to the complicated origins and occurrences of in vivo cfDNA. In addition, limited data are available concerning the cfDNA associated with autophagy and distributional difference between cf-mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) and cf-nuclear DNA (cf-nDNA) fragments. Here we developed an in vitro model of mouse microglial cell (BV-2) with starvation-induced autophagy, in which cfDNA was isolated from the cell supernatant by ultrafiltration (UF) and column-based commercial kit (CC), respectively. Using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, a DNA ladder pattern as the presence of peaks corresponding to mono-, di- and tri-nucleosomes was clearly visualized both in isolation products of UF and CC. However, we also detected shorter fragments than mono-nucleosome by UF. In comparing the UF and CC, we found that the former produced the higher recovery efficiency for spiked-in DNA of shorter fragments than mono-nucleosome in both water and medium, but the latter was superior for spiked-in DNA fragments which were longer than or equal to mono-nucleosome in medium. Combined with these two isolation methods, we have observed that autophagy-associated cf-mtDNA and cf-nDNA were both highly enriched in <mono-nucleosomes fragments more than 71%, and showed no significant differences in the relative percentages for these four fragment sizes. These results have improved our understanding of the fragment size distribution of autophagy-derived cf-mtDNA and cf-nDNA in vitro, and might further develop application of cfDNA as a diagnostic tool.

Abstract: The sequence encoding the CYP5164A3 of the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus (Stramenopiles, SAR) was heterologously expressed in E. coli cells. The resulting recombinant CYP74 clan-related protein CYP5164A3 possessed a selective activity towards the α-linolenic acid 13(S)-hydroperoxide (13-HPOTE) and eicosapentaenoic acid 15(S)-hydroperoxide (15-HPEPE). The major products were the heterobicyclic oxylipins. For instance, the 13-HPOTE was converted into plasmodiophorols A, B, and C formed at about 14:3:2 ratio. Plasmodiophorols A-C have been recently described as the products of enzyme hydroperoxide bicyclase CYP50918A1 of cercozoan Plasmodiophora brassicae (Rhizaria, SAR). Furthermore, an unknown compound 1 was detected. Purified product 1 (Me) was identified as a novel substituted 3-propenyl-6-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane based on its MS and NMR spectral data. Conversion of 15-HPEPE by CYP5164A3 resulted in products 7 and 8, analogous to plasmodiophorols A and B. This work uncovered the CYP5164A3 as the first hydroperoxide bicyclase in brown algae. Apparently, this enzyme plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of heterobicyclic oxylipins like hybridalactone, ecklonilactones, and related natural products, widespread in brown algae.

Abstract: Background
The dysregulation of gut microbiota can be found in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-related diabetic nephropathy (DN). Inhibitors of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) were reported to affect gut microbiota. This study aimed to identify whether empagliflozin (EMPA) attenuated DN via regulating gut microbiota.
Materials and methods
The high-fat diet (HFD) combining streptozocin (STZ) injection was performed to induce DN in mice. The therapeutic effects of EMPA were observed by staining of renal tissues and urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR). Mouse feces were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and fecal and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were determined. An antibiotic-ablated model was established to confirm the role of the gut microbiota in the actions of EMPA.
Results
EMPA reduced the elevation of blood glucose and UACR caused by HFD/STZ. It inhibited the thickening of the colonic crypt and restored goblet cells and the expressions of ZO-1 and Occludin. The 16S rRNA sequencing showed that the diversity of gut microbiota was reduced after HFD/STZ treatment, while it was restored after EMPA treatment. The LPS-producing bacteria, Oscillibacter, and the SCFA-producing bacteria, Bateroid and Odoribacter, were changed after EMPA administration. The therapeutic effects of EMPA on ABX-treated mice were reduced. Meanwhile, the level of fecal SCFAs was decreased, while the levels of fecal and serum LPS were elevated, in T2DM mice, and they were negated by the administration of EMPA.
Conclusion
EMPA ameliorates T2DM-related DN via altering the gut microbiota, especially reducing LPS-producing bacteria and increasing SCFA-producing bacteria.

Abstract: Background & aims
Dietary triglycerides (TG) retained in the intestine after a meal can be mobilized many hours later by glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) in humans and animal models, despite the well-documented absence of expression of the GLP-2 receptor on enterocytes. In this study, we examined the site of GLP-2 action to mobilize intestinal lipids and enhance chylomicron production.
Methods
In mesenteric lymph duct-cannulated rats, we assessed GLP-2-stimulated lymph flow rate, TG concentration, TG output, and apoB48 abundance 5 h after an intraduodenal lipid bolus, in the presence of a validated GLP-2 antagonist or vehicle. Additionally, the same GLP-2-stimulated parameters were examined in the presence or absence of cis-Golgi disruption by Brefeldin A (BFA).
Results
Compared to placebo, GLP-2 administration increased lymph flow by 2.8-fold (P < 0.001), cumulative lymph volume by 2.69-fold (P < 0.001) and total TG output 2-fold (P = 0.015). GLP-2 receptor antagonism markedly diminished GLP-2's ability to stimulate lymph flow, cumulative lymph volume and total TG output, demonstrating the dependence of GLP-2 stimulation of lymph flow and TG output on its receptor activation. In contrast, disruption of the cis-Golgi apparatus with Brefeldin A did not diminish the GLP-2-response of lymph flow i.e., increased lymph flow by 2.7-fold (P = 0.001), lymph volume by 2.9-fold (P = 0.001), and total TG output i.e., increased by 2.5-fold (P = 0.003).
Conclusions
GLP-2 mobilizes enteral lipid at a site distal to the Golgi, acting via its receptor. Since GLP-2 receptors are not expressed on enterocytes, GLP-2 likely mobilizes intestinal lipid residing extracellularly, either in the lamina propria or in the lymphatics.

Abstract: Cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) are known from lysosomotropism, drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL), activation of autophagy, and decreased cell viability, but the relationship between these events is not clear and little is known about DIPL in the endothelium. In this work, the effects of fluoxetine, amiodarone, clozapine, and risperidone on human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were studied using a combined methodology of label-free Raman imaging and fluorescence staining. Raman spectroscopy was applied to characterize biochemical changes in lipid profile and their distribution in the cellular compartments, while fluorescence staining (LysoTracker, LipidTOX, LC3B, and JC-1) was used to analyze lysosome volume expansion, activation of autophagy, lipid accumulation, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. We demonstrated that fluoxetine, amiodarone, and clozapine, but not risperidone, at non-toxic concentrations induced lipid accumulations in the perinuclear and cytoplasmic regions of endothelial cells. Spectroscopic markers of DIPL included a robust increase in the ratio (lipid/(protein + lipid)), an increase in choline-containing lipid, fatty acids, and the presence of cholesterol esters, while starvation-induced activated autophagy revealed a spectroscopic signature associated with subtle changes in the lipid profile only. Interestingly, lysosomal volume expansion, occurrence of DIPL, and activation of autophagy induced by selected CADs all depended on drug-accumulation in acidic pH of lysosome cellular compartments whereas reduced endothelial viability did not, and was attributed to mitochondrial mechanisms as evidenced by a decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In conclusion, drug-induced phospholipidosis in the endothelium did not reduce endothelial viability per se and can be efficiently assayed by Raman imaging.

Abstract: The perinatal exposome can modify offspring metabolism and health later in life. Within this concept, maternal exercise during gestation has been reported modifying offspring glucose sensing and homeostasis, while the impact of such exercise during lactation is little-known. We thus aimed at evaluating short- and long-term effects of it on offspring pancreatic function, assuming a link with changes in breast milk composition. Fifteen-week-old primiparous female Wistar rats exercised during lactation at a constant submaximal intensity (TR) or remained sedentary (CT). Male offspring were studied at weaning and at 7 months of age for growth, pancreas weight, glycemia and insulin responses. Milk protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA colorimetric method), and lipid content and fatty acid composition by gas chromatography. Mature milk from TR rats contained significantly less saturated (−7 %) and more monounsaturated (+18 %) and polyunsaturated (PUFA +12 %) fatty acids compared to CT rats, with no difference in total lipid and protein concentrations. In offspring from TR vs CT mothers, fasting glycemia was lower, pancreas weight was higher with a lower insulin content (−37 %) at weaning. Such outcomes were correlated with milk PUFA levels and indices of desaturase or elongase activities. These effects were no longer present at 7 months, whereas a more efficient muscle insulin sensitivity was observed. Maternal training during lactation led to a specific milk phenotype that was associated with a short-term impact on glucose homeostasis and pancreatic function of the male offspring.

Abstract: It was realized in the 1990s that some membrane proteins such as TNFα, both TNF receptors, ligands of the EGF-R and the Interleukin-6 receptor are proteolytically cleaved and are shed from the cell membrane as soluble proteins. The major responsible protease is a metalloprotease named ADAM17. So far, close to 100 substrates, including cytokines, cytokine receptors, chemokines and adhesion molecules of ADAM17 are known. Therefore, ADAM17 orchestrates many different signaling pathways and is a central signaling hub in inflammation and carcinogenesis. ADAM17 plays an important role in the biology of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) since the generation of the soluble Interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) is needed for trans-signaling, which has been identified as the pro-inflammatory activity of this cytokine. In contrast, Interleukin-6 signaling via the membrane-bound Interleukin-6 receptor is mostly regenerative and protective. Probably due to its broad substrate spectrum, ADAM17 is essential for life and most of the few human individuals identified with ADAM17 gene defects died at young age. Although the potential of ADAM17 as a therapeutic target has been recognized, specific blockade of ADAM17 is not trivial since the metalloprotease domain of ADAM17 shares high structural homology with other proteases, in particular matrix metalloproteases. Here, the critical functions of ADAM17 in IL-6, TNFα and EGF-R pathways and strategies of therapeutic interventions are discussed.

The alkalinizing, lysosomotropic agent ML-9 induces a pH-dependent depletion of ER Ca2+ stores in cellulo,

Abstract: ML-9 elicits a broad spectrum of effects in cells, including inhibition of myosin light chain kinase, inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ entry and lysosomotropic actions that result in prostate cancer cell death. Moreover, the compound also affects endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ homeostasis, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that ML-9 provokes a rapid mobilization of Ca2+ from ER independently of IP3Rs or TMBIM6/Bax Inhibitor-1, two ER Ca2+-leak channels. Moreover, in unidirectional 45Ca2+ fluxes in permeabilized cells, ML-9 was able to reduce ER Ca2+-store content. Although the ER Ca2+ store content was decreased, ML-9 did not directly inhibit SERCA's ATPase activity in vitro using microsomal preparations. Consistent with its chemical properties as a cell-permeable weak alkalinizing agent (calculated pKa of 8.04), ML-9 provoked a rapid increase in cytosolic pH preceding the Ca2+ efflux from the ER. Pre-treatment with the weak acid 3NPA blunted the ML-9-evoked increase in intracellular pH and subsequent ML-9-induced Ca2+ mobilization from the ER. This experiment underpins a causal link between ML-9's impact on the pH and Ca2+ dynamics. Overall, our work indicates that the lysosomotropic drug ML-9 may not only impact lysosomal compartments but also have severe impacts on ER Ca2+ handling in cellulo.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) and Pax-Foxo1 fusion negative rhabdomyosarcoma (FN-RMS) are pediatric sarcomas with poor prognoses in patients with advanced disease. In both malignancies, an actin binding protein has been linked to poor prognosis. Integrin adhesion complexes (IACs) are closely coupled to actin networks and IAC-mediated signaling has been implicated in the progression of carcinomas. However, the relationship of IACs and actin cytoskeleton remodeling with cell signaling is understudied in pediatric sarcomas. Here, we tested the hypothesis that IAC dynamics affect ERK activation in OS and FN-RMS cell lines. Adhesion dependence of ERK activation differed among the OS and FN-RMS cells examined. In the OS cell lines, adhesion did not have a consistent effect on phospho-ERK (pERK). ERK phosphorylation in response to fetal calf serum or 1 ng/ml EGF was nearly as efficient in OS cell lines and one FN-RMS cell line in suspension as cells adherent to poly-l-lysine (PL) or fibronectin (FN). By contrast, adhesion to plastic, PL or FN increased ERK phosphorylation and was greater than additive with a 15 min exposure to 1 ng/ml EGF in three FN-RMS cell lines. Increases in pERK were partly dependent on FAK and PAK1/2 but independent of IAC maturation. As far as we are aware, this examination of adhesion-dependent signaling is the first in pediatric sarcomas and has led to the discovery of differences from the prevailing paradigms and differences in the degree of coupling between components in the signaling pathways among the cell lines.

Abstract: Autophagy is a homeostatic process by which misfolded proteins, organelles and cytoplasmic material are engulfed in autophagosomal vesicles and degraded through a lisosomal pathway. FKBP8 is a member of the FK506-binding proteins family (FKBP) usually found in mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. This protein plays a critical role in cell functions such as protein trafficking and folding. In the present report we demonstrate that the depletion of FKBP8 abrogated autophagy activation induced by starvation, whereas the overexpression of this protein triggered the autophagy cascade. We found that FKBP8 co-localizes with ATG14L and BECN1, both members of the VPS34 lipid kinase complex, which regulates the initial steps in the autophagosome formation process. We have also demonstrated that FKBP8 is necessary for VPS34 activity. Our findings indicate that the regulatory function of FKBP8 in the autophagy process depends of its transmembrane domain. Surprisingly, this protein was not found in autophagosomal vesicles, which reinforces the notion that the FKBP8 only participates in the initial steps of the autophagosome formation process. Taken together, our data provide evidence that FKBP8 modulates the early steps of the autophagosome formation event by interacting with the VPS34 lipid kinase complex.
Summary
In this article, the protein FKBP38 is reported to be a novel modulator of the initial steps of the autophagic pathway, specifically in starvation-induced autophagy. FKBP38 interacts with the VPS34 lipid kinase complex, with the transmembrane domain of FKBP38 being critical for its biological function.

Abstract: Excessive cholesterol constitutes a major risk factor for vascular disease. Within cells, cholesterol is distributed in detergent-sensitive and detergent-resistant fractions, with the largest amount of cholesterol residing in cellular membranes. We set out to determine whether various arteries differ in their ability to accumulate esterified and non-esterified cholesterol in detergent-sensitive versus detergent-resistant fractions throughout the course of a high-cholesterol diet. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were placed on 2 % cholesterol diet while a control group was receiving iso-caloric standard chow. Liver, aorta, and pulmonary, mesenteric, and cerebral arteries were collected at 2–6, 8–12, 14–18, and 20–24 weeks from the start of high-cholesterol diet. After fraction separation, esterified and free non-esterified cholesterol levels were measured. In all arteries, largest cholesterol amounts were present in detergent-sensitive fractions in the non-esterified form. Overall, cholesterol in aorta and cerebral arteries was elevated during 14–18 weeks of high-cholesterol diet. Cerebral arteries also exhibited increase in esterified cholesterol within detergent-sensitive domains, as well as increase in cholesterol level in the detergent-resistant fraction at earlier time-points of diet. Pulmonary artery and mesenteric artery were largely resistant to cholesterol accumulation. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis revealed up-regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1) gene expression in cerebral arteries when compared to mesenteric and pulmonary arteries, respectively. In summary, we unveiled the differential ability of arteries to accumulate cholesterol over the course of a high-cholesterol diet. The differential accumulation of cholesterol seems to correlate with the up-regulated gene expression of proteins responsible for cholesterol uptake.

Abstract: Objective
Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are a minority population of glioma cells that regarded as the cause of tumor formation and recurrence. Identifying new molecular strategies targeting GSCs must be urgently developed to treat glioblastoma. In this study, one of CD98 light chain-L type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) was found as a potential GSC marker. LAT1 served as EAA transporter has been shown to be closely related with tumor invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and radiosensitivity.
Methods
LAT1+ and LAT1− glioma cells were sorted by flow cytometry. Cellular immunofluorescence, sphere-formation arrays, and in vitro limiting dilution experiments were used to identify cell stemness. Differentiated glioma stem cells were cultured, and the expressions of β-tubulinIII, GFAP, and LAT1 were detected by Western blot. Nude mouse models were constructed to observe tumor formation and metastasis in nude mice.
Results
LAT1+ glioma cells were testified a small percentage of all cells and selected as the subsequent sorting marker. LAT1+ cells were separated from U87 and U251 cells could express high level of stem cell markers, and possessed GSC properties including self-renewal ability and multi-directional differentiation potential. But LAT1− cells did not have these characteristics. In addition, LAT1+ cells were able to generate tumors in vivo, tumor size of LAT1+ cells formed were much bigger than that of LAT1− cells.
Conclusion
Our study, including molecular, cell, vitro and vivo experiments, has shown that LAT1+ cells possess GSC properties, and present for the first time that LAT1 can be used as a new marker for GSCs screening.

Abstract: The aim of this work was to identify elements of adaptive regulatory mechanism for basal level of yeast histone deacetylase Sir2. Heat shock response (HSR) was altered in the absence of the NAD-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpd1). Increase in HSR was lower in ΔGpd1 cells than wild-type cells. An inverse correlation existed between Gpd1 and Sir2; Sir2-deleted cells showed higher expression of Gpd1 while deletion of Gpd1 led to higher expression of Sir2. In the absence of Gpd1, basal activity of Sir2 promoter was higher and was increased further upon heat shock, suggesting higher Sir2 levels. No interaction between Gpd1 and Sir2 was detected without or with heat shock using immunoprecipitation. The results show that Gpd1 regulates HSR in yeast cells and likely blocks its uncontrolled activation. As uncontrolled stress adversely affects the cellular adaptive response, Gpd1 may be a component of the cell's catalogue to ensure a balanced response to unmitigated thermal stress.

Abstract: The SIN3 scaffolding protein is a conserved transcriptional regulator known to fine-tune gene expression. In Drosophila, there are two major isoforms of SIN3, SIN3 220 and SIN3 187, which each assemble into multi-subunit histone modifying complexes. The isoforms have distinct developmental expression patterns and non-redundant functions. Gene regulatory network analyses indicate that both isoforms affect genes encoding proteins in pathways such as the cell cycle and cell morphogenesis. Interestingly, the SIN3 187 isoform uniquely regulates a subset of pathways including post-embryonic development, phosphate metabolism and apoptosis. Target genes in the phosphate metabolism pathway include nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes coding for proteins responsible for oxidative phosphorylation. Here, we investigate the physiological effects of SIN3 isoforms on energy metabolism and cell survival. We find that ectopic expression of SIN3 187 represses expression of several nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes affecting production of ATP and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Forced expression of SIN3 187 also activates several pro-apoptotic and represses a few anti-apoptotic genes. In the SIN3 187 expressing cells, these gene expression patterns are accompanied with an increased sensitivity to paraquat-mediated oxidative stress. These findings indicate that SIN3 187 influences the regulation of mitochondrial function, apoptosis and oxidative stress response in ways that are dissimilar from SIN3 220. The data suggest that the distinct SIN3 histone modifying complexes are deployed in different cellular contexts to maintain cellular homeostasis.

Abstract: Gaba-ergic neurons are a diverse cell class with extensive influence over cortical processing, but their role in experience-dependent plasticity is not completely understood. Here we addressed the role of cortical somatostatin- (SOM-INs) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide- (VIP-INs) containing interneurons in a Pavlovian conditioning where stimulation of the vibrissae is used as a conditioned stimulus and tail shock as unconditioned one. This procedure induces a plastic change observed as an enlargement of the cortical functional representation of vibrissae activated during conditioning. Using layer-targeted, cell-selective DREADD transductions, we examined the involvement of SOM-INs and VIP-INs activity in learning-related plastic changes. Under optical recordings, we injected DREADD-expressing vectors into layer IV (L4) barrels or layer II/III (L2/3) areas corresponding to the activated vibrissae. The activity of the interneurons was modulated during all conditioning sessions, and functional 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) maps were obtained 24 h after the last session. In mice with L4 but not L2/3 SOM-INs suppressed during conditioning, the plastic change of whisker representation was absent. The behavioral effect of conditioning was disturbed. Both L4 SOM-INs excitation and L2/3 VIP-INs inhibition during conditioning did not affect the plasticity or the conditioned response. We found the activity of L4 SOM-INs is indispensable in the formation of learning-induced plastic change. We propose that L4 SOM-INs may provide disinhibition by blocking L4 parvalbumin interneurons, allowing a flow of information into upper cortical layers during learning.

Abstract: HDL-cholesterol is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, and is used in clinical practice for risk stratification. HDL is composed of many protein-defined subspecies that each comprises just a few percent of the total, some associated with lower and some with higher risk of CVD. HDL that contains apoC3 or apoE are subspecies that have opposing actions on HDL reverse cholesterol transport and opposing associations with risk of future CVD, apoC3 adverse and apoE beneficial. In addition to coronary heart disease, HDL that contains apoC3 is associated with risk of future type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance; ischemic stroke and cerebral infarction; dementia and the deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain. HDL that contains apoE and apoE itself are associated with lower risk of dementia. Other HDL subspecies that contain complement C3, alpha-2 macroglobulin, plasminogen, or haptoglobin are associated with higher future risk of coronary heart disease, whereas others such as HDL that contains apoC1 are associated with lower risk. At this time, these findings provide improved understanding of the multifaceted HDL system to better determine risk and targeting of therapy for the most prevalent chronic lifestyle diseases in our society.

Abstract: As a key adipogenic marker, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α) is also an important factor in regulating targets containing CCAAT element for transcription, whose products include coding and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). However, knowledge of the mechanism of C/EBPα affecting pre-adipocyte proliferation and adipogenesis through regulating ncRNA is still limited. In this study, we firstly conducted an investigation concerning the impact of C/EBPα knockdown on porcine pre-adipocytes by using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify the role of key ncRNAs, especially lncRNAs and their correlated mRNAs in regulating proliferation and differentiation of porcine pre-adipocytes. 97 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs and 4 DE lncRNAs were identified in si-C/EBPα groups compared with the si-NC groups. Meanwhile, we found C/EBPα directly target the promoter of a novel lncRNA, namely MSTRG.12568.2, which was trans-correlated with STYX (serine/threonine/tyrosine interacting protein), an important candidate gene for regulating cell proliferation. Moreover, FOXO3 (forkhead box O3) was identified as a co-regulator with MSTR.12568.2 for STYX. Overexpression and knockdown of any of the MSTRG.12568.2, STYX, and FOXO3 increased and decreased the levels of pre-adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, respectively, which demonstrated that they played a positive role in adipogenesis of pre-adipocytes. Furthermore, our results revealed that FOXO3 was necessary for MSTRG.12568.2 to trans-activate STYX. We revealed that C/EBPα regulated pre-adipocyte proliferation and differentiation through mediating trans-activation of MSTRG.12568.2-FOXO3 to STYX. These results provide a novel regulation signal for C/EBPα to influence porcine pre-adipocyte proliferation and differentiation and greatly benefit to our understanding of molecular mechanism regulating subcutaneous adipogenesis.

Abstract: Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-membrane resident protein that inserts a double bond into saturated fatty acids, converting them into their monounsaturated counterparts. Previous studies have demonstrated an important role for SCD1 in modulating tissue and systemic health. Specifically, lack of hepatic or cutaneous SCD1 results in significant reductions in tissue esterified lipids. While the intestine is an important site of lipid esterification and assimilation into the body, the regulation of intestinal SCD1 or its impact on lipid composition in the intestine and other tissues has not been investigated. Here we report that unlike other lipogenic enzymes, SCD1 is enriched in the distal small intestine and in the colon of chow-fed mice and is robustly upregulated by acute refeeding of a high-sucrose diet. We generated a mouse model lacking SCD1 specifically in the intestine (iKO mice). These mice have significant reductions not only in intestinal lipids, but also in plasma triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, cholesterol esters, and free cholesterol. Additionally, hepatic accumulation of diacylglycerols is significantly reduced in iKO mice. Comprehensive targeted lipidomic profiling revealed a consistent reduction in the myristoleic (14:1) to myristic (14:0) acid ratios in intestine, liver, and plasma of iKO mice. Consistent with the reduction of the monounsaturated fatty acid myristoleic acid in hepatic lipids of chow fed iKO mice, hepatic expression of Pgc-1α, Sirt1, and related fatty acid oxidation genes were reduced in chow-fed iKO mice. Further, lack of intestinal SCD1 reduced expression of de novo lipogenic genes in distal intestine of chow-fed mice and in the livers of mice fed a lipogenic high-sucrose diet. Taken together, these studies reveal a novel pattern of expression of SCD1 in the intestine. They also demonstrate that intestinal SCD1 modulates lipid content and composition of not only intestinal tissues, but also that of plasma and liver. Further, these data point to intestinal SCD1 as a modulator of gut-liver crosstalk, potentially through the production of novel signaling lipids such as myristoleic acid.

Abstract: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae cAMP regulates different cellular processes through PKA. The specificity of the response of the cAMP-PKA pathway is highly regulated. Here we address the mechanism through which the cAMP-PKA pathway mediates its response to heat shock and thermal adaptation in yeast. PKA holoenzyme is composed of a regulatory subunit dimer (Bcy1) and two catalytic subunits (Tpk1, Tpk2, or Tpk3). PKA subunits are differentially expressed under certain growth conditions. Here we demonstrate the increased abundance and half-life of TPK1 mRNA and the assembly of this mRNA in cytoplasmic foci during heat shock at 37 °C. The resistance of the foci to cycloheximide-induced disassembly along with the polysome profiling analysis suggest that TPK1 mRNA is impaired for entry into translation. TPK1 expression was also evaluated during a recurrent heat shock and thermal adaptation. Tpk1 protein level is significantly increased during the recovery periods. The crosstalk of cAMP-PKA pathway and CWI signalling was also studied. Wsc3 sensor and some components of the CWI pathway are necessary for the TPK1 expression upon heat shock. The assembly in foci upon thermal stress depends on Wsc3. Tpk1 expression is lower in a wsc3∆ mutant than in WT strain during thermal adaptation and thus the PKA levels are also lower. An increase in Tpk1 abundance in the PKA holoenzyme in response to heat shock is presented, suggesting that a recurrent stress enhanced the fitness for the coming favourable conditions. Therefore, the regulation of TPK1 expression by thermal stress contributes to the specificity of cAMP-PKA signalling.

Abstract: Retinol-binding protein 2 (RBP2, also known as cellular retinol-binding protein 2 (CRBP2)) is a member of the fatty acid-binding protein family and has been extensively studied for its role in facilitating dietary vitamin A (retinol) uptake and metabolism within enterocytes of the small intestine. RBP2 is present in highest concentrations in the proximal small intestine where it constitutes approximately 0.1–0.5% of soluble protein. Recent reports have established that RBP2 binds monoacylglycerols (MAGs) with high affinity, including the canonical endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Crystallographic studies reveal that retinol, 2-AG, or other long-chain MAGs alternatively can bind in the retinol-binding pocket of RBP2. It also has been demonstrated recently that Rbp2-deficient mice are more susceptible to developing obesity and associated metabolic phenotypes when exposed to a high fat diet, or as they age when fed a conventional chow diet. When subjected to an oral fat challenge, the Rbp2-deficient mice release into the circulation significantly more, compared to littermate controls, of the intestinal hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). These new findings regarding RBP2 structure and actions within the intestine are the focus of this review.

Abstract: The key enzymes of lipid biosynthesis in oleaginous filamentous fungi exist as metabolons. However, the existence of a similar organization in other groups of oleaginous microorganisms is still unknown. In this study, we confirmed the occurrence of two separate and distinct lipogenic metabolons in a thraustochytrid, Aurantiochytrium SW1. These involve the Type I Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) pathway, consisting of six enzymes: fatty acid synthase, malic enzyme (ME), ATP: citrate lyase (ACL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), malate dehydrogenase (MD) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC), and the Polyketide Synthase-like (PKS) pathway, consisting of PKS subunits a, b, c, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), ACL and ACC. This suggests that the NADPH requirement for the FAS pathway is primarily generated and channelled by ME whereas G6PDH and 6PGDH fulfil this role for the PKS pathway. Diminished biosynthesis of palmitic acid (16:0), docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3, DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5 n-6, DPA) correlated with the dissociation of their respective metabolons thereby suggesting that regulation of the pathways is achieved through the formation and dissociation of the metabolons.

Abstract: Aims
Engagement of epidermal growth factor (EGF) with its receptor (EGFR) produces a broad range of cancer phenotypes. The overriding aim of this study was to understand EGFR signaling and its regulation by the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) in cancer cells.
Results
In ovarian cancer cells and other cancer cell types, EGF-induced activation of oncogenic Akt is mediated by both the canonical PI3K-PDK1 pathway and by CaMKK2. Akt activation induced by EGF occurs by both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent mechanisms. In contrast to the canonical pathway, CaMKK2 neither binds to, nor is regulated by phosphoinositides but is activated by Ca2+/CaM. Akt activation at its primary activation site, T308 occurs by direct phosphorylation by CaMKK2, but activation at its secondary site (S473), is through an indirect mechanism requiring mTORC2. In cells in which another CaMKK2 target, 5′AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) was deleted, Akt activation and calcium-dependency of activation were still observed. CaMKK2 accumulates in the nucleus in response to EGF and regulates transcription of phosphofructokinase platelet (PFKP) a glycolytic regulator. CaMKK2 is required for optimal PFK activity. CaMKK2 regulates transcription of plasminogen activator, urokinase (PLAU) a metastasis regulator. The EGFR inhibitor gefitinib synergizes with CaMKK2 inhibition in the regulation of cell survival and increases the dose-reduction index. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of CaMKK2 leads to compensatory PTEN downregulation and upregulation of Akt activation.
Conclusions
CaMKK2-mediation of EGFR action may enable cancer cells to use intracellular calcium elevation as a signal for growth and survival.

Abstract: Black seed extract stimulates apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) gene expression in hepatocytes and intestinal cells in part by elevating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) levels. To explore potential ramifications of these observations, we examined the effects of black seed extract on hepatocyte lipid content and expression of key transcriptional regulators of fatty acid β-oxidation and lipogenesis in HepG2 cells. PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), RXRα, thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ), sterol-responsive element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), and sterol-responsive element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) levels were measured in black seed extract treated liver-derived HepG2 cells. Black seed extract treatment increased PPARα and RXRα expression and decreased intracellular neutral lipid content. Black seed extract treatment increased TRβ expression and activity, and PPARα activity. In contrast, PPARγ, SREBP1 and SREBP2 levels were decreased in black seed extract treated cells. Black seed extract treatment also increased acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 5 (ACSL5), peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A) expression, three PPARα-dependent rate-limiting genes that facilitate fatty acid oxidation, similar to fenofibrate. PPARα knockdown reversed the effects of fenofibrate and blackseed on ACSL5, ACOX1, and CPT-1A expression. In conclusion, black seed extract-mediated lipid lowering in HepG2 cells is associated with increased expression of fatty acid oxidation enzymes and PPARα and reduced lipogenic signaling. Thus black seed extract may be potentially beneficial in metabolic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome.

DDIT3/CHOP mediates the inhibitory effect of ER stress on chondrocyte differentiation by AMPKα-SIRT1 pathway,

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response related to multiple diseases, including temporomandibular joint (TMJ) cartilage-related diseases. Recent studies have indicated that DDIT3/CHOP (a downstream transcription factor of ER stress) is an important effector in mediating ER stress to inhibit chondrogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism by which DDIT3 regulates chondrogenesis remains unclear. In this study, tunicamycin (an ER stress agonist)-induced ER stress inhibited chondrocyte differentiation and matrix synthesis in vitro and led to an osteoarthritis-like phenotype in mouse TMJ cartilage. Meanwhile, DDIT3 expression in chondrocytes was robustly upregulated. Loss-of-function experiments validated the inhibiting effect of DDIT3 on chondrocyte differentiation and matrix synthesis. Mechanistically, the inhibiting effect was attributed to the direct and indirect regulatory effect of DDIT3 on SIRT1 (sirtuin1, silent mating type information regulation protein type 1, a member of NAD+ dependent class III histone deacetylases). On one hand, DDIT3 directly promoted the transcription of SIRT1. On the other hand, DDIT3 indirectly increased the expression of SIRT1 by promoting AMPKα phosphorylation and activation. Furthermore, activation of AMPKα or SIRT1 with the corresponding agonist AICAR or resveratrol in the DDIT3-knockdown cells partially restored the inhibiting effect of DDIT3 on chondrocyte differentiation and matrix synthesis. Collectively, these novel findings indicate that DDIT3 regulates the inhibitory effect of ER stress on chondrocyte differentiation and matrix synthesis partially via the AMPKα-SIRT1 pathway. A thorough understanding of ER stress in regulating chondrocyte homeostasis and its role in the onset of osteoarthritis may be promising to develop therapeutic targets and prevent condyle cartilage destruction.

Abstract: The tumor suppressor protein p53 governs many cellular pathways to control genome integrity, metabolic homeostasis, and cell viability. The critical roles of p53 highlight the importance of proper control over p53 in maintaining normal cellular function, with the negative regulators MDM2 and MDMX playing central roles in regulating p53 activity. The interaction between p53 and either MDM2 or MDMX involves the p53 transactivation domain (p53TD) and the N-terminal domains (NTD) of MDM2 or MDMX. Recently, the acidic domain (AD) of MDMX was found to bind to its own NTD, inhibiting the p53-MDMX interaction. Given the established structural and functional similarity between the MDM2 and MDMX NTDs, we hypothesized that the MDMX AD would also directly bind to MDM2 NTD to inhibit p53-MDM2 interaction. Through solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we show that the MDMX AD can indeed directly interact with the MDM2 NTD and, as a result, can compete for p53 binding. The MDMX AD is thus able to serve as a regulatory domain to inhibit the MDM2-p53 interaction and may also play a direct role in p53 activation.

Abstract: Clathrin, made up of the heavy- and light-chains, constitutes one of the most abundant proteins involved in intracellular protein trafficking and endocytosis. YPR129W, which encodes RGG-motif containing translation repressor was identified as a part of the multi-gene construct (SCD6) that suppressed clathrin deficiency. However, the contribution of YPR129W alone in suppressing clathrin deficiency has not been documented. This study identifies YPR129W as a necessary and sufficient gene in a multi-gene construct SCD6 that suppresses clathrin deficiency. Importantly, we also identify cytoplasmic RGG-motif protein encoding gene PSP2 as another novel suppressor of clathrin deficiency. Detailed domain analysis of the two suppressors reveals that the RGG-motif of both Scd6 and Psp2 is important for suppressing clathrin deficiency. Interestingly, the endocytosis function of clathrin heavy chain assayed by internalization of GFP-Snc1 and α-factor secretion activity are not complemented by either Scd6 or Psp2. We further observe that inhibition of TORC1 compromises the suppression activity of both SCD6 and PSP2 to different extent, suggesting that two suppressors are differentially regulated. Scd6 granules increased based on its RGG-motif upon Chc1 depletion. Strikingly, Psp2 overexpression increased the abundance of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in Chc1 depleted cells in its RGG-motif dependent manner and also decreased the accumulation of GFP-Atg8 foci. Overall based on our results using SCD6 and PSP2, we identify a novel role of RGG-motif containing proteins in suppressing clathrin deficiency. Since both the suppressors are RNA-binding proteins, this study opens an exciting avenue for exploring the connection between clathrin function and post-transcriptional gene control processes.

Abstract: Developmental DNA elimination in Paramecium tetraurelia occurs through a trans-nuclear comparison of the genomes of two distinct types of nuclei: the germline micronucleus (MIC) and the somatic macronucleus (MAC). During sexual reproduction, which starts with meiosis of the germline nuclei, MIC-limited sequences including Internal Eliminated Sequences (IESs) and transposons are eliminated from the developing MAC in a process guided by noncoding RNAs (scnRNAs and iesRNAs). However, our current understanding of this mechanism is still very limited. Therefore, studying both genetic and epigenetic aspects of these processes is a crucial step to understand this phenomenon in more detail. Here, we describe the involvement of homologs of classical meiotic proteins, Spo11, Msh4-1, and Msh5 in this phenomenon. Based on our analyses, we propose that proper functioning of Spo11, Msh4-1, and Msh5 during Paramecium sexual reproduction are necessary for genome reorganization and viable progeny. Also, we show that double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA induced during meiosis by Spo11 are crucial for proper IESs excision. In summary, our investigations show that early sexual reproduction processes may significantly influence later somatic genome integrity.

Abstract: Autoimmune-led challenge resulting in β-cell loss is responsible for the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Melatonin, a pineal hormone or sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor, has increased β-cell mass in various diabetic models and has immunoregulatory property. Both β-cell regenerative capacity and melatonin secretion decrease with ageing. Thus, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of melatonin combined with sitagliptin on β-cell regeneration under glucotoxic stress, in the streptozotocin-induced young and old diabetic mouse models, and euglycemic humanized islet transplant mouse model. Our results suggest that combination therapy of sitagliptin and melatonin show an additive effect in inducing mouse β-cell regeneration under glucotoxic stress, and in the human islet transplant mouse model. Further, in the young diabetic mouse model, the monotherapies induce β-cell transdifferentiation and reduce β-cell apoptosis whereas, in the old diabetic mouse model, melatonin and sitagliptin induce β-cell proliferation and β-cell transdifferentiation, and it also reduces β-cell apoptosis. Further, in both the models, combination therapy reduces fasting blood glucose levels, increases plasma insulin levels and glucose tolerance and promotes β-cell proliferation, β-cell transdifferentiation, and reduces β-cell apoptosis. It can be concluded that combination therapy is superior to monotherapies in ameliorating diabetic manifestations, and it can be used as a future therapy for β-cell regeneration in diabetes patients.

Abstract: Inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation without dysregulating endothelial cells (ECs) may provide an ideal therapy for in-stent restenosis. Due to its anti-proliferation effect on VSMCs and pro-endothelium effect, arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been used in a drug-eluting stent in a recent clinical trial. However, the underlying mechanism by which ATO achieves this effect has not been determined. In the present work, we showed that ATO induced apoptosis in VSMCs but not in ECs. Mechanistically, ATO achieved this through modulation of cellular metabolism to increase lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in VSMCs, while LPA concentration was stable in ECs. The elevated LPA facilitated the nuclear accumulation and initiated the transcriptional function of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in VSMCs. YAP regulated the transcription of N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) modulators (Mettl14 and Wtap) to increase the m6A methylation levels of apoptosis-related genes to induce their high expression and exacerbate VSMCs apoptosis. On the other hand, YAP nuclear accumulation in ECs was not observed. Collectively, our data exhibited the molecular process involved in selective apoptosis of VSMCs induced by ATO.

Abstract: Because of the lack of specific molecular targeted therapies, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has high tumour recurrence and metastasis rates. It is urgent to develop novel chemotherapeutic strategies to improve patient survival. DNA damaging agents have been shown to sensitize cancer to genotoxic chemotherapies. We first found that 6-thioguanine (6-TG) can activate the NF-кB signalling pathway. Our results showed that NF-кB signalling was reduced when cells were treated with 6-TG/disulfiram (DSF)/Cu. DSF/Cu enhanced the 6-TG-mediated inhibition of proliferation. 6-TG/DSF/Cu inhibited cell cycle progression, causing cell cycle arrest in the S phase and G2/M phase. Moreover, the combined effect of 6-TG and DSF/Cu induced apoptosis, and either agent alone was able to induce apoptosis. The accumulation of γH2A indicated that DSF/Cu increased the DNA damage induced by 6-TG. Combined treatment with 6-TG and DSF/Cu synergistically reduced the levels of both phosphorylated and total ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated-and-Rad3-related kinase (ATR), suggesting that DSF/Cu promoted 6-TG-induced DNA damage by suppressing ATR protein kinases, therefore enhancing cell apoptosis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the combination of 6-TG and DSF/Cu exerted a significant synergistic antitumour effect on human TNBC in vitro and in vivo by enhancing DNA damage and disrupting DNA damage checkpoints. We propose that this combination therapy could be a novel strategy for the treatment of TNBC.

Abstract: Endothelial cells (ECs) degrade the extracellular matrix of vessel walls and contact surrounding cells to facilitate migration during angiogenesis, leading to formation of an EC-tubular network (ETN). Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) support ETN formation when co-cultured with ECs, but the mechanism is incompletely understood. We examined the role of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) system, i.e. the serine protease uPA, its inhibitor PAI-1, receptor uPAR/CD87, clearance by the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1) and their molecular partners, in the formation of ETNs supported by adipose tissue-derived MSC. Co-culture of human umbilical vein ECs (HUVEC) with MSC increased mRNA expression levels of uPAR, MMP14, VEGFR2, TGFβ1, integrin β3 and Notch pathway components (Notch1 receptor and ligands: Dll1, Dll4, Jag1) in HUVECs and uPA, uPAR, TGFβ1, integrin β3, Jag1, Notch3 receptor in MSC. Inhibition at several steps in the activation process indicates that uPA, uPAR and LRP1 cross-talk with αv-integrins, VEGFR2 and Notch receptors/ligands to mediate ETN formation in HUVEC-MSC co-culture. The urokinase system mediates ETN formation through the coordinated action of uPAR, uPA's catalytic activity, its binding to uPAR and its nuclear translocation. These studies identify potential targets to help control aberrant angiogenesis with minimal impact on healthy vasculature.

Abstract: The nuclear envelope (NE) is a bilayer membrane that separates and physically isolates the genetic material from the cytoplasm. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are cylindrical structures embedded in the NE and remain the sole channel of communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The interior of NPCs contains densely packed intrinsically disordered FG-nucleoporins (FG-Nups), consequently forming a permeability barrier. This barrier facilitates the selection and specificity of the cargoes that are imported, exported, or shuttled through the NPCs. Recent studies have revealed that FG-Nups undergo the process of liquid-liquid phase separation into liquid droplets. Moreover, these liquid droplets mimic the permeability barrier observed in the interior of NPCs. This review highlights the phase separation of FG-Nups occurring inside the NPCs rooted in the NE. We discuss the phase separation of FG-Nups and compare the different aspects contributing to their phase separation. Furthermore, several diseases caused by the aberrant phase separation of the proteins are examined with respect to NEs. By understanding the fundamental process of phase separation at the nuclear membrane, the review seeks to explore the parameters influencing this phenomenon as well as its importance, ultimately paving the way for better research on the structure-function relationship of biomolecular condensates.

Abstract: Certain viviparous animals possess mechanisms for mother-to-embryo nutrient transport during gestation. Xenotoca eiseni is one such viviparous teleost species in which the mother supplies proteins and other components to the offspring developing in the ovary. The embryo possesses trophotaenia, hindgut-derived placental structure, to receive the maternal supplement. However, research on the molecular mechanisms underlying viviparous species is scarce in non-mammalian vertebrates, including teleosts. Thus, we conducted this study to investigate the mechanism for nutrient absorption and degradation in trophotaeniae of X. eiseni. A tracer assay indicated that a lipid transfer protein, vitellogenin (Vtg), was absorbed into the epithelial layer cells of the trophotaeniae. Vtg uptake was significantly suppressed by Pitstop-2, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Gene expression analysis indicated that the genes involved in endocytosis-mediated lipolysis and lysosomal cholesterol transport were expressed in the trophotaeniae. In contrast, plasma membrane transporters expressed in the intestinal tract were not functional in the trophotaeniae. Our results suggested that endocytosis-mediated lysosomal lipolysis is one of the mechanisms underlying maternal component metabolism. Thus, our study demonstrated how viviparous teleost species have acquired a unique developmental system that is based on the hindgut-derived placenta.

Abstract: Elevated plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Circulating LDL is derived from very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism and cleared by LDL receptor (LDLR). We have previously demonstrated that cargo receptor Surfeit 4 (Surf4) mediates VLDL secretion. Inhibition of hepatic Surf4 impairs VLDL secretion, significantly reduces plasma LDL-C levels, and markedly mitigates the development of atherosclerosis in LDLR knockout (Ldlr−/−) mice. Here, we investigated the role of Surf4 in lipoprotein metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis in another commonly used mouse model of atherosclerosis, apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE−/−) mice. Adeno-associated viral shRNA was used to silence Surf4 expression mainly in the liver of apoE−/− mice. In apoE−/− mice fed a regular chow diet, knockdown of Surf4 expression significantly reduced triglyceride secretion and plasma levels of non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides without causing hepatic lipid accumulation or liver damage. When Surf4 was knocked down in apoE−/− mice fed the Western-type diet, we observed a significant reduction in plasma levels of non-HDL cholesterol, but not triglycerides. Knockdown of Surf4 did not increase hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels or cause liver damage, but significantly diminished atherosclerosis lesions. Therefore, our findings indicate the potential of hepatic Surf4 inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Neutrophil proteinase 3 (PR3) is a multifunctional neutral serine protease involved in the regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, but its potential causal roles in the lipid-driven responses in atherosclerosis have remained unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the presence of PR3 in human atherosclerotic lesions and the ability of this protease to modify the structure and functions of LDL and HDL particles in vitro. Coronary artery segments were collected from autopsied subjects and immunostained for PR3. Atherosclerotic lesions but not normal intima contained PR3. Incubation of LDL particles with the PR3 led to extensive degradation of their apoB-100 component and strongly increased their binding strength to isolated human aortic proteoglycans in vitro. Moreover, cultured human monocyte-derived macrophages avidly ingested the PR3-modified LDL particles and were converted into foam cells. Incubation of HDL particles with PR3 led to proteolysis of their major apolipoproteins (apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoE) and impaired their ability to promote cholesterol efflux from the macrophage foam cells. We conclude that PR3 is present in human atherosclerotic lesions and that this neutral serine protease has proatherogenic properties. Thus, by proteolytically modifying LDL and HDL particles, PR3 may promote cholesterol accumulation both extra- and intracellularly in atherosclerotic lesions, and so contribute to the lipid-driven component of atherogenesis.

Abstract: Trophoblasts are specialized epithelial cells of the placenta that are involved in invasion, communication and the exchange of materials between the mother and fetus. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) plays critical roles in regulating such processes in other cell types, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms that control this second messenger in trophoblasts. In the current study, the presence of RyRs and their accessory proteins in placental tissues and in the BeWo choriocarcinoma, a model trophoblast cell-line, were examined using immunohistochemistry and Western immunoblotting. Contributions of RyRs to Ca2+ signalling and to random migration in BeWo cells were investigated using fura-2 fluorescent and brightfield videomicroscopy. The effect of RyR inhibition on reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton elicited by the hormone angiotensin II, was determined using phalloidin-labelling and confocal microscopy. RyR1 and RyR3 proteins were detected in trophoblasts of human first trimester and term placental villi, along with the accessory proteins triadin and calsequestrin. Similarly, RyR1, RyR3, triadin and calsequestrin were detected in BeWo cells. In this cell-line, activation of RyRs with micromolar ryanodine increased [Ca2+]c, whereas pharmacological inhibition of these channels reduced Ca2+ transients elicited by the peptide hormones angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin and endothelin 1. Angiotensin II increased the velocity, total distance and Euclidean distance of random migration by BeWo cells and these effects were significantly reduced by tetracaine and by inhibitory concentrations of ryanodine. RyRs contribute to reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton elicited by angiotensin II, since inhibition of these channels restores the parallelness of these structures to control levels. These findings demonstrate that trophoblasts contain a suite of proteins similar to those in other cell types possessing highly developed Ca2+ signal transduction systems, such as skeletal muscle. They also indicate that these channels regulate the migration of trophoblast cells, a process that plays a key role in development of the placenta.

Abstract: The small intestine is a highly adaptable organ serving as both a barrier to the external environment and a conduit for nutrient absorption. Enterocytes package dietary triglycerides (TG) into chylomicrons for transport into circulation; the remaining TGs are stored in cytosolic lipid droplets (CLDs). The current study aimed to characterize the impact of diet composition on intestinal lipid handling in male and female wild-type mice. Mice were continued on their grain-based diet (GBD) and switched to either a high-fat, high cholesterol Western-style diet (WD) or a ketogenic diet (KD) for 3 or 5 weeks. KD-fed mice displayed significantly higher plasma TG levels in response to an olive oil gavage than WD- and GBD-fed mice; TG levels were ~2-fold higher in male KD-fed mice than female KD-fed mice. Poloxamer-407 experiments revealed enhanced intestinal-TG secretion rates in male mice fed a KD upon olive oil gavage, whereas secretion rates were unchanged in female mice. Surprisingly, jejunal CLD size and TG mass after oil gavage were similar among the groups. At fasting, TG mass was significantly higher in the jejunum of male KD-fed mice and the duodenum of female KD-fed mice, providing increased substrate for chylomicron formation. In addition to greater fasting intestinal TG stores, KD-fed male mice displayed longer small intestinal lengths, while female mice displayed markedly longer jejunal villi lengths. After 5 weeks of diet, 12 h fasting-2 h refeeding experiments revealed jejunal TG levels were similar between diet groups in male mice; however, in female mice, jejunal TG mass was significantly higher in KD-fed mice compared to GBD- and WD-fed mice. These experiments reveal that KD feeding promotes distinct morphological and functional changes to the murine small intestine compared to the WD diet. Moreover, changes to intestinal lipid handling in response to carbohydrate and protein restriction manifest differently in male and female mice.

Abstract: Puerarin, one of the main components of Pueraria lobata, has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and anti-apoptotic effects. However, the role of puerarin in ototoxic drug-induced hair cell injury has not been well characterized. This study explored whether puerarin protects against cisplatin-induced hair cell damage and its potential mechanisms. The viability of puerarin-treated HEI-OC1 cells was assessed by CCK8 assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was estimated with flow cytometric analysis using Cellrox Green fluorescent probe. Apoptosis-related protein levels were detected by western blot analysis. Immunostaining of the organ of Corti was performed to determine mice cochlear hair cell survival. Our results showed that puerarin improved cell viability and suppressed apoptosis in the cisplatin-damaged HEI-OC1 cells and cochlear hair cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that puerarin attenuated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by regulating apoptotic related proteins, such as Bax and cleaved caspase-3, and attenuated ROS accumulation after cisplatin damage. Moreover, puerarin was involved in regulating the Akt pathway in HEI-OC1 cells in response to cisplatin. Our results demonstrated that puerarin administration decreased the sensitivity to apoptosis dependent on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by reducing ROS generation, which could be used as a new protective agent against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.

Abstract: Podocyte foot processes are an important cellular layer of the glomerular barrier that regulates glomerular permeability. Insulin via the protein kinase G type Iα (PKGIα) signaling pathway regulates the balance between contractility and relaxation (permeability) of the podocyte barrier by regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This mechanism was shown to be disrupted in diabetes. Rho family guanosine-5′-triphosphates (GTPases) are dynamic modulators of the actin cytoskeleton and expressed in cells that form the glomerular filtration barrier. Thus, changes in Rho GTPase activity may affect glomerular permeability to albumin. The present study showed that Rho family GTPases control podocyte migration and permeability. Moreover these processes are regulated by insulin in PKGIα-dependent manner. Modulation of the PKGI-dependent activity of Rac1 and RhoA GTPases with inhibitors or small-interfering RNA impair glomerular permeability to albumin. We also demonstrated this mechanism in obese, insulin-resistant Zucker rats. We propose that PKGIα-Rac1-RhoA crosstalk is necessary in proper organization of the podocyte cytoskeleton and consequently the stabilization of glomerular architecture and regulation of filtration barrier permeability.

Abstract: Disseminated prostate cancer (PCa) is known to have a strong propensity for bone marrow. These disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) can survive in bone marrow for years without obvious proliferation, while maintaining the ability to develop into metastatic lesions. However, how DTCs kept dormant and recur is still uncertain. Here, we focus on the role of osteoblastic protein kinase D1 (PKD1) in PCa (PC-3 and DU145) dormancy using co-culture experiments. Using flow cytometry, western blotting, and immunofluorescence, we observed that in co-cultures osteoblasts could induce a dormant state in PCa cells, which is manifested by a fewer cell divisions, a decrease Ki-67-positive populations and a lower ERK/p38 ratio. In contrast, silencing of PKD1 gene in osteoblasts impedes co-cultured prostate cancer cell's dormancy ability. Mechanismly, protein kinase D1 (PKD1) in osteoblasts induces PCa dormancy via activating CREB1, which promoting the expression and secretion of growth arrest specific 6 (GAS6). Furthermore, GAS6-induced dormancy signaling significantly increased the expression of core circadian clock molecules in PCa cells, and a negative correlation of circadian clock proteins (BMAL1, CLOCK and DEC2) with recurrence-free survival is observed in metastatic prostate cancer patients. Interestingly, the expression of cell cycle factors (p21, p27, CDK1 and PCNA) which regulated by circadian clock also upregulated in response to GAS6 stimulation. Taken together, we provide evidence that osteoblastic PKD1/CREB1/GAS6 signaling regulates cellular dormancy of PCa cells, and highlights the importance of circadian clock in PCa cells dormancy.

Abstract: Aims
Prostate cancer continues to be one of the main global health issues in men. Neuropeptide substance P (SP) acting via neurokinin-1receptor (NK1R) promotes tumorigenicity in many human malignant tumors. However, its pro-tumorigenic functions and the therapeutic effects of its inhibition in prostate cancer remain unclear.
Methods
MTT assay was employed for measuring cellular proliferation and cytotoxicity. mRNAs and proteins expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blot assay, respectively. Gelatinase activity was assessed by zymography. The migration ability was defined using wound-healing assay. Flow cytometry was employed to evaluate the cell cycle distribution. We also performed an in vivo experiment in a mouse model of prostate cancer to confirm the in vitro therapeutic effect of targeting the SP/NK1R system.
Results
We found a noticeable increase in the expression of the truncated isoform of NK1R as an oncogenic NK1R splice variant in tumor cells. We also demonstrated that SP promotes both proliferative and migrative phenotypes of prostate cancer through modifying cell cycle-related proteins (c-Myc, cyclin D1, cyclin B1, p21), and apoptosis-related genes (Bcl-2 and Bax), promoting cell migration and increasing MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity, while aprepitant administration could remarkably reverse these effects. SP also stimulated tumor growth in vivo, which was correlated with shorter survival times, while aprepitant reversed this effect and led to significantly longer survival time.
Significance
Our findings suggest that SP/NK1R system may serve as a novel therapeutic target in prostate cancer and support the possible candidacy of aprepitant in future prostate cancer therapy.

Abstract: The phagocyte NADPH oxidase (NOX2) is a key enzyme of the innate immune system generating superoxide anions (O2•-), precursors of reactive oxygen species. The NOX2 protein complex is composed of six subunits: two membrane proteins (gp91phox and p22phox) forming the catalytic core, three cytosolic proteins (p67phox, p47phox and p40phox) and a small GTPase Rac. The sophisticated activation mechanism of the NADPH oxidase relies on the assembly of cytosolic subunits with the membrane-bound components. A chimeric protein, called ‘Trimera’, composed of the essential domains of the cytosolic proteins p47phox (aa 1–286), p67phox (aa 1–212) and full-length Rac1Q61L, enables a constitutive and robust NOX2 activity in cells without the need of any stimulus. We employed Trimera as a single activating protein of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase in living cells and examined the consequences on the cell physiology of this continuous and long-term NOX activity. We showed that the sustained high level of NOX activity causes acidification of the intracellular pH, triggers apoptosis and leads to local peroxidation of lipids in the membrane. These local damages to the membrane correlate with the strong tendency of the Trimera to clusterize in the plasma membrane observed by FRET-FLIM microscopy.

Abstract: The prion protein is a multifunctional protein that exists in at least two different folding states. It is subject to diverse proteolytic processing steps that lead to prion protein fragments some of which are membrane-bound whereas others are soluble. A multitude of ligands bind to the prion protein and besides proteinaceous binding partners, interaction with metal ions and nucleic acids occurs. Although of great importance, information on structural and functional consequences of prion protein binding to its partners is limited. Here, we will reflect on the structure-function relationship of the prion protein and its binding partners considering the different folding states and prion protein fragments.

Abstract: Prostate cancer is the second most frequent type of cancer that affects men. Docetaxel (DTX) administration is the front-line therapy for patients with advanced prostate cancer and unfortunately, half of these patients develop resistance to DTX which could be due to its ability to activate the NF-κB pathway. The combinational effect of DTX and nimbolide on proliferation, apoptosis, activation of NF-κB, DNA binding ability of NF-κB, and expression of NF-κB-targeted gene products was investigated. The antitumor and antimetastatic effect of DTX or NL alone or in combination was also examined. The co-administration of NL and DTX resulted in a significant loss of cell viability with enhanced apoptosis in DTX-sensitive/resistant prostate cancer cells. NL abrogated DTX-triggered NF-κB activation and expression of its downstream antiapoptotic factors (survivin, Bcl-2, and XIAP). The combination of NL and DTX significantly reduced the DNA binding ability of NF-κB in both cell types. NL significantly enhanced the antitumor effect of DTX and reduced metastases in orthotopic models of prostate cancer. NL abolishes DTX-induced-NF-κB activation to counteract cell proliferation, tumor growth, and metastasis in the prostate cancer models.

Abstract: Rho GTPases like RAC1 are localized on the inner side of the outer cell membrane where they act as molecular switches that can trigger signal transduction pathways in response to various extracellular stimuli. Nuclear functions of RAC1 were identified that are related to mitosis, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Previously, we showed that RAC1 plays a role in the doxorubicin (Dox)-induced DNA damage response (DDR). In this context it is still unknown whether cytosolic RAC1 modulates the Dox-induced DDR or if a nuclear fraction of RAC1 is involved. Here, we silenced RAC1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) pharmacologically with EHT1864 or by using siRNA against Rac1. Additionally, we transfected MEF with RAC1 mutants (wild-type, dominant-negative, constitutively active) containing a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). Afterwards, we analysed the Dox-induced DDR by evaluation of fluorescent nuclear γH2AX and 53BP1 foci formation, as well as by detection of activated proteins of the DDR by western blot to elucidate the role of nuclear RAC1 in the DDR. Treatment with EHT1864 as well as Rac1 knock-down reduced the Dox-induced DSB-formation to a similar extent. Enhanced nuclear localization of dominant-negative as well as constitutively active RAC1 mimicked these effects. Expression of the RAC1 mutants altered the Dox-induced amount of pP53 and pKAP1 protein. The observed effects were independent of S1981 ATM phosphorylation. We conclude that RAC1 is required for a substantial activation of the Dox-induced DDR and balanced levels of active/inactive RAC1 inside the nucleus are a prerequisite for this response.

Abstract: The molecules induced by hypoxia have been supposed to be important regulators of first trimester trophoblast activity, but the key mechanism mediating invasion of trophoblast cells is not fully illustrated. Here, we found that the expression of RNA demethylase ALKBH5 was upregulated in trophoblast upon hypoxia treatment and decreased in extravillous trophoblast (EVT) of patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). Furthermore, we found that trophoblast-specific knockdown of ALKBH5 in mouse placenta suppressed the invasion of trophoblast and significantly led to fetus abortion in vivo. Then ALKBH5 was identified to promote the invasion of trophoblast. Mechanistically, we identified transcripts with altered methylation in trophoblast induced by hypoxia via m6A-seq, ALKBH5 translocated from nucleus to cytoplasm upon hypoxia treatment and demethylated certain target transcripts, such as m6A-modified SMAD1/SMAD5, consequently enhanced the translation of SMAD1/SMAD5 and then promoted MMP9 and ITGA1 production. Thus, we demonstrated that ALKBH5 promoted the activity of trophoblasts by enhancing SMAD1/5 expression via erasing their m6A modifications. Our research revealed a new m6A epigenetic way to regulate the invasion of trophoblast, which suggested a novel potential therapeutic target for spontaneous abortion prevention.

Abstract: The induction of DNA damage together with the interference with DNA repair represents a promising strategy in cancer treatment. Here we show that the PARP-1/2/3 inhibitor AZD2461 in combination with the CHK1 inhibitor UCN-01 altered the DNA damage response and reduced cell proliferation in PEL cells, an aggressive B cell lymphoma highly resistant to chemotherapies. AZD2461/UCN-01 combination activated p53/p21 and downregulated c-Myc in these cells, leading to a reduced expression level of RAD51, molecule involved in DNA repair. The effect of AZD2461/UCN-01 on c-Myc and p53/p21 was inter-dependent and, besides impairing cell proliferation, contributed to the activation of the replicative cycle of KSHV, carried in a latent state in PEL cells. Finally, we found that the pharmacological or genetic inhibition of p21 counteracted the viral lytic cycle activation and further reduced PEL cell proliferation, suggesting that it could induce a double beneficial effect in this setting.

Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation generates pyrimidine dimers on DNA, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6-4) photoproducts. Such dimers distort the high-order DNA structure and prevent transcription and replication. The nucleotide excision repair (NER) system contributes to resolving this type of DNA lesion. There are two pathways that recognize pyrimidine dimers. One acts on transcribed strands of DNA (transcription-coupled NER), and the other acts on the whole genome (global genome-NER; GG-NER). In the latter case, DNA damage-binding protein 2 (DDB2) senses pyrimidine dimers with several histone modification enzymes. We previously reported that histone acetyltransferase binding to ORC1 (HBO1) interacts with DDB2 and facilitates recruitment of the imitation switch chromatin remodeler at UV-irradiated sites via an unknown methyltransferase. Here, we found that the phosphorylated histone methyltransferase mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) was maintained at UV-irradiated sites in an HBO1-dependent manner. Furthermore, MLL1 catalyzed histone H3K4 methylation and recruited the chromatin remodeler bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain 1A (BAZ1A)/ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor 1 (ACF1). Depletion of MLL1 suppressed BAZ1A accumulation at UV-irradiated sites and inhibited the removal of CPDs. These data indicate that the DDB2-HBO1-MLL1 axis is essential for the recruitment of BAZ1A to facilitate GG-NER.

Abstract: Urea transporter B (UT-B, encoded by the SLC14A1 gene) is a membrane channel protein involved in urea transmembrane transport. Compared with normal tissues, UT-B expression is significantly decreased in most tumours, especially melanoma. However, the UT-B role in tumorigenesis and development is still unclear. Herein, we investigated the effects of UT-B overexpression on polyamine metabolism and the urea cycle in murine melanoma B16 cells, to explore the roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and p53 activation in cell growth and polyamines metabolism. UT-B overexpression in B16 cells decreased cell growth, increased apoptosis, and significantly altered metabolic pathways related to the urea cycle, which were characterized by reduced production of urea and polyamines and increased production of nitric oxide. Subsequently, we observed that activation of the p53 pathway may be the main cause of the above phenomena. The p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α partially restored the production of polyamines, but the mitochondrial morphology and function were still impaired. Further treatment of UT-B-overexpressing B16 cells with reactive oxygen species scavenging agent N-acetyl-l-cysteine and coenzyme Q10 restored cell viability and mitochondrial function and increased polyamine production. In conclusion, UT-B overexpression caused mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress in B16 cells, and then activated p53 expression, which may be one of the mechanisms leading to the decrease in intracellular polyamines.

Abstract: Cisplatin is a platinum-containing drug with ototoxicity commonly used clinically and has significant efficacy against a variety of solid tumors. One of the most important mechanisms of ototoxicity is that cisplatin induces apoptosis of hair cells. According to relevant literature, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP, anti-apoptotic protein) could inhibit the apoptotic pathway. We hypothesized that this protein might protect cochlear hair cells from cisplatin-induced injury. To figure it out, we treated cochlea of normal mice with various concentrations of cisplatin to observe the response and morphology of hair cells and determine a reasonable concentration. Next, Western Blot and quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) experiments were conducted to make an investigation about the expression of XIAP protein and mRNA. In addition, we constructed and identified XIAP overexpressing mice. Finally, we treated cochlear tissues of normal and overexpressing mice with cisplatin to investigate the cyto-protection of XIAP on hair cells, respectively. It was found that 50 μmol/L cisplatin resulted in significant loss and disorganization of hair cells, while simultaneously downregulating the protein and mRNA of XIAP. In XIAP overexpressing mice, the loss and disorganization of hair cells were significantly lessened. These results showed that XIAP can lessen cisplatin-induced hair cell loss and play a role in otoprotection.

Abstract: Autophagy is regulated by phosphoinositides. We have previously shown that phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) is localized in the autophagosomal membrane. Additionally, in yeast cells, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases Pik1p and Stt4p play important roles in the formation of the autophagosome and its fusion with the vacuole, respectively. In this study, we analyzed the primary role of PtdIns(4)P phosphatases in yeast autophagy. The PtdIns(4)P labeling densities in the membranes of the vacuoles, mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane dramatically increased in the phosphatase deletion mutants sac1∆ and sjl3∆, and the temperature-sensitive mutant sac1ts/sjl3∆ at the restrictive temperature. GFP-Atg8 processing assay indicated defective autophagy in the sac1∆ and sac1ts/sjl3∆ mutants. In contrast to the localization of PtdIns(4)P in the luminal leaflet of autophagosomal membranes in the wild-type yeast, PtdIns(4)P was localized in both the luminal and cytoplasmic leaflets of the autophagosomal membranes in the sac1∆ strain. In addition, the number of autophagic bodies in the vacuole significantly decreased in the sac1∆ strain, although autophagosomes were present in the cytoplasm. In the sac1ts/sjl3∆ strain, the number of autophagosomes in the cytoplasm dramatically decreased at the restrictive temperature. Considering that the numbers of autophagosomes and autophagic bodies in the sjl3∆ strain were comparable to those in the wild-type yeast, we found that the autophagosome could not be formed when PtdIns(4)P phosphatase activities of both Sac1p and Sjl3p were diminished. Together, these results indicate that the turnover of PtdIns(4)P by phosphatases is essential for autophagosome biogenesis.

Abstract: The vascular and lymphatic systems in the gut regulate lipid transport while restricting transfer of commensal gut microbiota and directing immune cell trafficking. Increased permeability of the endothelial systems in the intestine associates with passage of antigens and microbiota from the gut into the bloodstream leading to tissue inflammation, the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and ultimately to abnormalities of systemic metabolism. Recent studies show that lipid metabolism maintains homeostasis and function of intestinal blood and lymphatic endothelial cells, BECs and LECs, respectively. This review highlights recent progress in this area, and information related to the contribution of the lipid transporter CD36, abundant in BECs and LECs, to gastrointestinal barrier integrity, inflammation, and to gut regulation of whole body metabolism. The potential role of endothelial lipid delivery in epithelial tissue renewal after injury and consequently in the risk of gastric and intestinal diseases is also discussed.

Abstract: Δ-6 desaturase (D6D) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). Evidence suggests that reduced D6D activity not only disrupts LC-PUFA production, but also impacts whole body lipid handling and body weight; however, the mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Therefore, we investigated the effect of D6D inhibition on the regulation of lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with and without changes in n-3 PUFA content. 3T3-L1 cells were treated with a D6D inhibitor (SC-26196) in the presence or absence of α-linolenic acid (ALA) throughout differentiation. We found that D6D inhibition blocked the conversion of ALA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-3) when ALA was supplemented, while no changes in n-3 PUFA content were observed in cells treated with the D6D inhibitor alone. D6D inhibited cells had reduced triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation despite an EPA/DPA deficiency. In addition, analyses of cellular protein markers, as well as non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol release in medium, suggested an increase in lipolysis and a decrease in fatty acid re-esterification in D6D-inhibited cells, independent of n-3 PUFA changes. To provide further evidence, we treated cells with the D6D inhibitor in the presence or absence of EPA and compared them with ALA-treated cells. Although EPA further reduced TAG content, the reduced markers of fatty acid re-esterification were not affected by ALA or EPA. Collectively, this study provides new insight showing that D6D inhibition reduces TAG accumulation and fatty acid re-esterification in adipocytes independent of changes in n-3 PUFA cellular content.

Abstract: Processing of dietary fats in the intestine is a highly regulated process that influences whole-body energy homeostasis and multiple physiological functions. Dysregulated lipid handling in the intestine leads to dyslipidemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In intestinal enterocytes, lipids are incorporated into lipoproteins and cytoplasmic lipid droplets (CLDs). Lipoprotein synthesis and CLD metabolism are inter-connected pathways with multiple points of regulation. This review aims to highlight recent advances in the regulatory mechanisms of lipid processing in the enterocyte, with particular focus on CLDs. In-depth understanding of the regulation of lipid metabolism in the enterocyte may help identify therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Actin-based, finger-like cell protrusions such as microvilli and filopodia play important roles in epithelial cells. Several proteins have been identified to regulate cell protrusion formation, which helps us to learn about the underlying mechanism of this process. FCH domain and double SH3 domains containing protein 2 (FCHSD2) belongs to the FCH and Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (F-BAR) protein family, containing an N-terminal F-BAR domain, two SH3 domains, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding interface (PBI). Previously, we found that FCHSD2 interacts with WASP/N-WASP and stimulates ARP2/3-mediated actin polymerization in vitro. In the present work, we show that FCHSD2 promotes the formation of apical and lateral cell protrusions in cultured cells. Our data suggest that FCHSD2 cooperates with CDC42 and N-WASP in regulating apical cell protrusion formation. In line with this, biochemical studies reveal that FCHSD2 and CDC42 simultaneously bind to N-WASP, forming a protein complex. Interestingly, the F-BAR domain of FCHSD2 induces lateral cell protrusion formation independently of N-WASP. Furthermore, we show that the ability of FCHSD2 to induce cell protrusion formation requires its plasma membrane-binding ability. In summary, our present work suggests that FCHSD2 cooperates with CDC42 and N-WASP to regulate cell protrusion formation in a membrane-dependent manner.

Abstract: The discovery of apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) in 2001 has raised a number of intriguing questions about its role in lipid transport and triglyceride (TG) homeostasis. Genome-wide association studies have consistently identified APOA5 as a regulator of plasma TG levels, which is further supported by studies in transgenic and knockout mouse models. The present review describes recent concepts pertaining to the roles of APOA5 in TG metabolism as related to the vascular compartment, liver, adipose tissue and the gut. Recent evidence indicates that APOA5 may also affect postprandial TG metabolism through influencing chylomicron formation and transport by the intestine into the intestinal lymph. While substantial evidence supports the notion that APOA5 plays both extracellular and intracellular roles in TG homeostasis, mysteries remain on how this low-abundance, liver-derived protein may modulate TG homeostasis, including via the gut. Given the strong correlation between elevated plasma TG and cardiometabolic diseases, there is great scientific and public interest in understanding the intriguing mysteries presented by APOA5.

Abstract: The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing globally. NAFLD includes non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the pathological form of the disease characterized by liver steatosis, inflammation, cell injury, and fibrosis. A fundamental contributor to NASH is the imbalance between lipid accretion and disposal. The accumulation of liver lipids precipitates lipotoxicity and the inflammatory contributions to disease progression. This review defines the role of dysregulated of lipid disposal in NAFLD pathophysiology. The characteristic changes in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism pathways and the factors promoting these changes across the spectrum of NAFLD severity are detailed. This includes pathway-specific and integrative perturbations in mitochondrial β-oxidation, citric acid cycle flux, oxidative phosphorylation, and ketogenesis. Moreover, well-recognized and emerging mechanisms through which dysregulated mitochondrial oxidative metabolism mediates inflammation, fibrosis, and disease progression are highlighted.

Abstract: Hearing loss in the elderly cause communication difficulties, decreased quality of life, isolation, loneliness and frustration. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of drug repurposing candidates in aging mouse. The selected candidate drugs for age-related hearing loss (ARHL) included atorvastatin (AS) and sarpogrelate. Monotherapy or fixed dose combination (FDC) products were administered via oral gavage for 6 consecutive months. Auditory outcomes showed significant hearing preservation in AS-treated aging mice compared to aging control, especially in the early stages of ARHL in both 8 and 16 kHz frequencies. However, none of the FDC products were able to prevent ARHL regardless of AS involvement. In aging mice, damage and dysfunction of mitochondria was noted as well as reactive oxygen species overproduction leading to oxidative stress and intrinsic apoptosis. These processes of ARHL were significantly prevented with administration of AS. Normal structures of mitochondria were maintained, and antioxidant activity were proceeded by activation of HSF1/Sirt1 pathway. Our study suggests that AS is a promising drug repurposing candidate to delay the progression of ARHL.

Abstract: Optical microscopy has been a basic and standard technique in cell biology research for decades. Microscopy techniques function well for thin, optically transparent cultures and allow for the imaging of thicker biological specimens. There is no better method of in vitro cell observation and analysis, hence microscopic techniques are extensively used and constitute an optimal tool for cell culture studies. This paper proposes an original methodology of optical microscopy data processing based on the phase contrast technique during cell culture monitoring. By exploiting images recorded during cell proliferation, a surface reconstruction was performed based on assumption, it can be considered that the local brightness of the image depends on the cells' thickness and thus the obtained results can be interpreted in the form of a surface that represents a three-dimensional structure, which allowed for a quantitative description of the cell evolution. The 3D data obtained enabled the investigation of parameters describing the morphology of the cells and the topology of their proliferation. These parameters included cell sizes in plane but also in the direction perpendicular to it, cell volume changes, their spatial distribution, as well as anisotropy and directivity. The method presented provides data carrying information similar to that obtained using a holographic microscope, e.g. A HoloMonitor (Phase Holographic Imaging PHI Inc.), or from confocal scanning microscopy with the “z-stack” mode. The techniques of bright field or phase contrast cell observation are, however, much cheaper, and widely available when compared to holographic microscopy, for instance. Besides, these also enable monitoring of cell activity over time, i.e. the study and quantitative description of dynamic changes in the cells. The proposed approach uses generally available free tools such as ImageJ software with BoneJ and Particle Analyzer plugins. The methodology is suitable for even a basic microscope, it can be easily implemented as a script, and thus data processing can be significantly shortened, the methodology can be automated, and also applied for data processing in real time.

Abstract: Cardiac fibrosis is associated with increased stiffness of the myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) in part mediated by increased cardiac fibroblast proliferation However, our understanding of the mechanisms regulating cardiac fibroblast proliferation are incomplete. Here we characterise a novel mechanism involving a combined activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) targets RUNX Family Transcription Factor 2 (RUNX2) and TEA Domain Transcription Factor (TEAD). We demonstrate that cardiac fibroblast proliferation is enhanced by interaction with a stiff ECM compared to a soft ECM. This is associated with activation of the transcriptional co-factor, YAP. We demonstrate that this stiffness induced activation of YAP enhances the transcriptional activity of both TEAD and RUNX2 transcription factors. Inhibition of either TEAD or RUNX2, using gene silencing, expression of dominant-negative mutants or pharmacological inhibition, reduces cardiac fibroblast proliferation. Using mutants of YAP, defective in TEAD or RUNX2 activation ability, we demonstrate a dual role of YAP-mediated activation of TEAD and RUNX2 for substrate stiffness induced cardiac fibroblast proliferation. Our data highlights a previously unrecognised role of YAP mediated RUNX2 activation for cardiac fibroblast proliferation in response to increased ECM stiffness.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) stimulates tumorigenesis by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration. TGFβ signaling is regulated by the endocytosis of cell surface receptors and their subcellular trafficking into the endo-lysosomal system. Here we investigated how autophagy, a cellular quality control network that delivers material to lysosomes, regulates TGFβ signaling pathways that induce EMT and cell migration. We impaired autophagy in non-small cell lung cancer cells using chloroquine, spautin-1, ULK-101, or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting autophagy-related gene (ATG)5 and ATG7 and observed that inhibiting autophagy results in a decrease in TGFβ1-dependent EMT transcription factor and cell marker expression, as well as attenuated stress fiber formation and cell migration. This correlated with decreased internalization of cell surface TGFβ receptors and their trafficking to early/late endosomal and lysosomal compartments. The effects of autophagy inhibition on TGFβ signaling were investigated by Smad2/Smad3 phosphorylation and cellular localization using western blotting, subcellular fractionation, and immunofluorescence microscopy. We observed that inhibiting autophagy decreased the amount and timeframe of Smad2/Smad3 signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that inhibiting autophagy attenuates pro-tumorigenic TGFβ signaling by regulating receptor trafficking, resulting in impaired Smad2/Smad3 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation.

Abstract: Two classes of replication intermediates have been observed from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in many mammalian tissue and cells with two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. One is assigned to leading-strand synthesis in the absence of synchronous lagging-strand synthesis (strand-asynchronous replication), and the other has properties of coupled leading- and lagging-strand synthesis (strand-coupled replication). While strand-asynchronous replication is primed by long noncoding RNA synthesized from a defined transcription initiation site, little is known about the commencement of strand-coupled replication. To investigate it, we attempted to abolish strand-asynchronous replication in cultured human cybrid cells by knocking out the components of the transcription initiation complexes, mitochondrial transcription factor B2 (TFB2M/mtTFB2) and mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT/mtRNAP). Unexpectedly, removal of either protein resulted in complete mtDNA loss, demonstrating for the first time that TFB2M and POLRMT are indispensable for the maintenance of human mtDNA. Moreover, a lack of TFB2M could not be compensated for by mitochondrial transcription factor B1 (TFB1M/mtTFB1). These findings indicate that TFB2M and POLRMT are crucial for the priming of not only strand-asynchronous but also strand-coupled replication, providing deeper insights into the molecular basis of mtDNA replication initiation.

Abstract: Connexin 43 (Cx43)-mediated gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) plays a crucial role in the pathology and physiology of joint tissues. Transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2), one of the potent regulatory factors in chondrocytes, plays a key role in the regulation of cell cycle and development of joint diseases. However, it is still unknown how TGF-β2 mediates GJIC in chondrocytes. The aim of this study was to explore the potential mechanism by which TGF-β2 regulates GJIC in chondrocytes. CCK-8 assays and scratch assays were performed to define the role of TGF-β2 on cell proliferation and migration. The scrape loading/dye transfer assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to verify the effect of TGF-β2 on GJIC between chondrocytes. qPCR was performed to analyse the expression of genes in the gap junction protein family in chondrocytes. The expression of the Cx43 protein and phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3) was evaluated by western blot assay. Immunofluorescence staining was used to explore p-Smad3 signalling pathway activation and Cx43 distribution. From these experiments, we found that the Cx43 protein was the most highly expressed member of the gap junction protein family in chondrocytes. We also found that TGF-β2 facilitated cell-to-cell communication in chondrocytes by upregulating Cx43 expression in chondrocytes. Finally, we found that TGF-β2 activated Smad3 signalling and promoted the nuclear aggregation of p-Smad3. Inhibition experiments by SIS3 also confirmed that TGF-β2-mediated GJIC through p-Smad3 signalling. For the first time, this study confirmed that TGF-β2 could regulate the formation of Cx43-mediated GJIC in chondrocytes via the canonical p-Smad3 signalling pathway.

Abstract: Leukotriene (LT) C4 synthase (LTC4S) catalyzes the conversion from LTA4 to LTC4, which is a proinflammatory lipid mediator in asthma and other inflammatory diseases. LTC4 is metabolized to LTD4 and LTE4, all of which are known as cysteinyl (Cys) LTs and exert physiological functions through CysLT receptors. LTC4S is expressed in adipocytes. However, the function of CysLTs and the regulatory mechanism in adipocytes remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression of LTC4S and production of CysLTs in murine adipocyte 3T3-L1 cells and their underlying regulatory mechanisms. Expression of LTC4S and production of LTC4 and CysLTs increased during adipogenesis, whereas siRNA-mediated suppression of LTC4S expression repressed adipogenesis by reducing adipogenic gene expression. The CysLT1 receptor, one of the two LTC4 receptors, was expressed in adipocytes. LTC4 and LTD4 increased the intracellular triglyceride levels and adipogenic gene expression, and their enhancement was suppressed by co-treatment with pranlukast, a CysLT1 receptor antagonist. Moreover, the expression profiles of LTC4S gene/protein during adipogenesis resembled those of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ. LTC4S expression was further upregulated by treatment with troglitazone, a PPARγ agonist. Promoter-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that PPARγ directly bound to the PPAR response element of the LTC4S gene promoter in adipocytes. These results indicate that the LTC4S gene expression was enhanced by PPARγ, and LTC4 and LTD4 activated adipogenesis through CysLT1 receptors in 3T3-L1 cells. Thus, LTC4S and CysLT1 receptors are novel potential targets for the treatment of obesity.

Abstract: Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) is a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme that is widely expressed in embryonic tissues. The expression of PKM2 declines in some tissues following embryogenesis, while other pyruvate kinase isozymes are upregulated. However, PKM2 is highly expressed in cancer cells and is believed to play a role in supporting anabolic processes during tumour formation. In this study, PKM2 was identified as an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-interacting protein by mass spectrometry. The PKM2:IP3R interaction was further characterized by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, which showed that PKM2 interacted with all three IP3R isoforms. Moreover, fluorescence microscopy indicated that both IP3R and PKM2 localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. PKM2 binds to IP3R at a highly conserved 21-amino acid site (corresponding to amino acids 2078–2098 in mouse type 1 IP3R isoform). Synthetic peptides (denoted ‘TAT-D5SD’ and ‘D5SD’), based on the amino acid sequence at this site, disrupted the PKM2:IP3R interaction and potentiated IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release both in intact cells (TAT-D5SD peptide) and in a unidirectional 45Ca2+ flux assay on permeabilized cells (D5SD peptide). The TAT-D5SD peptide did not affect the enzymatic activity of PKM2. Reducing PKM2 protein expression using siRNA increased IP3R-mediated Ca2+ signalling in intact cells without altering the ER Ca2+ content. These data identify PKM2 as an IP3R-interacting protein that inhibits intracellular Ca2+ signalling. The elevated expression of PKM2 in cancer cells is therefore not solely connected to its canonical role in glycolytic metabolism, rather PKM2 also has a novel non-canonical role in regulating intracellular signalling.

Abstract: CD147/Basigin/EMMPRIN is overexpressed in several cancerous tissues and it has been shown to induce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) whose expression is associated with cancer metastasis. Thus, targeting CD147 with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) potentially has therapeutic applications in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we report the use of anti-CD147 mAbs targeting domain 1 of CD147, namely M6-1D4 (IgM), M6-1F3 (IgM), M6-2F9 (IgM) and M6-1E9 (IgG2a), against several human cancer cell lines. Strikingly, IgM but not IgG mAbs against CD147, especially clone M6-1D4, induced acute cellular swelling, and this phenomenon appeared to be specifically found with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Furthermore, molecular investigation upon treating HepG2 cells with M6-1D4 showed unfolded protein response (UPR) activation, autophagosome accumulation, and cell cycle arrest, but without classic apoptosis related features. More interestingly, prolonged M6-1D4 treatment (24 h) resulted in irreversible oncosis leading to necroptosis. Furthermore, treatment with a mixed lineage kinase domain-like psuedokinase (MLKL) inhibitor and partial knockout of MLKL resulted in reduced sensitivity to necroptosis in M6-1D4-treated HepG2 cells. Surprisingly however, the observed necroptotic signaling axis appeared to be non-canonical as it was independent of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIPK) phosphorylation. In addition, no cytotoxic effect on human dermal fibroblast (HDF) was observed after incubation with M6-1D4. Taken together, this study provides clues to target CD147 in HCC using mAbs, as well as sheds new light on a novel strategy to kill cancerous cells by the induction of necroptosis.

Abstract: The development of cancer treatment has recently achieved a remarkable breakthrough, and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has received much attention. To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, recent studies have revealed the importance of activation of CD4+ T cells via an increase in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules in cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) 22, negatively regulates MHC-II expression. Gene knockout of TRIM22 using Cas9-sgRNAs led to an increase of MHC-II proteins, while TRIM22 overexpression remarkably decreased MHC-II proteins. mRNA levels of MHC-II and class II transactivator (CIITA), which plays an essential role in the regulation of MHC-II transcription, were not affected by TRIM22. Furthermore, TRIM22 knockout did not suppress the degradation of MHC-II protein but rather promoted it. These results suggest that TRIM22 decreases MHC-II protein levels through a combination of multiple mechanisms other than transcription or degradation. We showed that inhibition of TRIM22 can increase the amount of MHC-II expression in cancer cells, suggesting a possibility of providing the biological basis for a possible therapeutic target to potentiate checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.

Abstract: The activation of Nuclear Factor, Erythroid 2 Like 2 – Kelch Like ECH Associated Protein 1 (NRF2-KEAP1) signaling pathway plays a critical dual role by either protecting or promoting the carcinogenesis process. However, its activation or nuclear translocation during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression has not been addressed yet. This study characterizes the subcellular localization of both NRF2 and KEAP1 during diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat. NRF2-KEAP1 pathway was continuously activated along with the increased expression of its target genes, namely Nqo1, Hmox1, Gclc, and Ptgr1. Similarly, the nuclear translocation of NRF2, MAF, and KEAP1 increased in HCC cells from weeks 12 to 22 during HCC progression. Likewise, colocalization of NRF2 with KEAP1 was higher in the cell nuclei of HCC neoplastic nodules than in surrounding cells. Moreover, immunofluorescence analyses revealed that the interaction of KEAP1 with filamentous Actin was disrupted in HCC cells. This disruption may be contributing to the release and nuclear translocation of NRF2 since the cortical actin cytoskeleton serves as anchoring of KEAP1. In conclusion, this evidence indicates that NRF2 is progressively activated and promotes the progression of experimental HCC.

Abstract: Fibulin-3 is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is present in elastic tissue and involved in carcinoma development. Previous studies have indicated that fibulin-3 may affect skeletal development, cartilage, and osteoarthritis (OA). This study aims to investigate the function of fibulin-3 on chondrocytes under tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) stimulation and in murine OA models, and explore the possible mechanism. It was found that fibulin-3 was increased in the cartilage of OA models and in the chondrogenic cells ATDC5 stimulated by TNF-α. Fibulin-3 promoted the proliferation of ATDC5 cells both in the presence and absence of TNF-α. Moreover, overexpression of fibulin-3 suppressed the chondrogenic and hypertrophic differentiation of ATDC5 cells, while knockdown of fibulin-3 caused the opposite effect. Mechanistically, fibulin-3 partially suppressed the activation of TGF-β/Smad3 signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Smad3. SIS3, a Smad3 inhibitor, decreased the chondrogenesis of articular cartilages in OA models, and partially reversed the chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells caused by knockdown of fibulin-3 in the presence of TNF-α. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) showed that fibulin-3 could only interact with TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI), although overexpression of fibulin-3 reduced the protein levels of both TβRI and TβRII. In conclusion, this study indicates that fibulin-3 modulates the chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells in inflammation partially via TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway.

Abstract: In order to avoid a prolonged pro-inflammatory neutrophil response, signaling downstream of an agonist-activated G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) has to be rapidly terminated. Among the family of GPCR kinases (GRKs) that regulate receptor phosphorylation and signaling termination, GRK2, which is highly expressed by immune cells, plays an important role. The medium chain fatty acid receptor GPR84 as well as formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), receptors expressed in neutrophils, play a key role in regulating inflammation. In this study, we investigated the effects of GRK2 inhibitors on neutrophil functions induced by GPR84 and FPR2 agonists. GRK2 was shown to be expressed in human neutrophils and analysis of subcellular fractions revealed a cytosolic localization. The GRK2 inhibitors enhanced and prolonged neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by GPR84- but not FPR2-agonists, suggesting a receptor selective function of GRK2. This suggestion was supported by β-arrestin recruitment data. The ROS production induced by a non β-arrestin recruiting GPR84 agonist was not affected by the GRK2 inhibitor. Termination of this β-arrestin independent response relied, similar to the response induced by FPR2 agonists, primarily on the actin cytoskeleton. In summary, we show that GPR84 utilizes GRK2 in concert with β-arrestin and actin cytoskeleton dependent processes to fine-tune the activity of the ROS generating NADPH-oxidase in neutrophils.

Abstract: Protein-S-glutathionylation promotes redox signaling in physiological and oxidative distress conditions. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) promotes insulin resistance by down-regulating adipocyte insulin signaling, however, its S-glutathionylation and significance is not known. In this context, we report reversible S-glutathionylation of Gal-3. Site-directed mutagenesis established Gal-3 Cys187 as the putative S-glutathionylation site. Glutathionylated Gal-3 prevents Gal-3(WT)-Insulin Receptor interaction and facilitates insulin-induced murine adipocyte p-IRS1(tyr895) and p-AKT(ser473) signaling and glucose uptake in a Gal-3 Cys187 glutathionylation dependent manner in murine adipocytes, as assessed by Western blotting and 2-NBDG uptake assay respectively. Pre-glutathionylated Gal-3 at Cys187 resisted irreversible oxidation by H2O2. M2 macrophages showed enhanced Gal-3 S-glutathionylation when compared to M1 phenotype. Serum and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from control mice showed increased Gal-3 S-glutathionylation as compared to db/db mice. A significant increase in Gal-3 S-glutathionylation was observed in metformin-treated db/db mice when compared to db/db mice alone. Similar to murine, enhanced Gal-3 S-glutathionylation is observed in primary human monocyte derived M2 macrophages when compared to the M1 macrophage phenotype and Gal-3 regulates primary human adipocyte insulin signaling in a glutathionylation dependent manner. Collectively, we identified Gal-3 S-glutathionylation as a protective phenomenon, which relieves its inhibitory effect on adipocyte insulin signaling.

Abstract: Ring finger protein 2 (RNF2), as a well-known E3 ligase, has an oncogenic role in various cancers. The role of RNF2 in colon cancer is still unknown. The aim of this work is to determine the biological role of RNF2 in colon cancer. We first examined the expression of RNF2 and interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) in colon cancer patients and colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and HCT116). Compared with normal tumor-adjacent tissues, RNF2 was up-regulated whereas IRF4 was down-regulated in the colon cancer tissues. RNF2 was also up-regulated in colon cancer cells with respect to human fetal colon epithelial cells. RNF2 overexpression enhanced the ability of proliferation, migration and invasion of SW480 cells, whereas RNF2 knockdown caused an opposite result in HCT116 cells. Furthermore, a tumor xenograft model was constructed to verify the impact of RNF2 overexpressed-SW480 cells on tumor growth. RNF2 up-regulation elevated Ki-67 proliferation index, accelerated the growth of tumor tissues, and led to severe colon tissue damage in the tumor xenograft mice. In addition, RNF2 interacted with IRF4, and repressed IRF4 protein expression. IRF4 was a substrate of RNF2, and RNF2 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of IRF4. RNF2 overexpression increased the ability of proliferation, migration and invasion in SW480 cells by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of IRF4. In conclusion, this work demonstrated that RNF2 promoted tumor growth in colon cancer by regulating ubiquitination and degradation of IRF4. Thus, RNF2 may be served as a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer.

Survivin suppression heightens BZML-induced mitotic catastrophe to overcome multidrug resistance by removing therapy-induced senescent A549/Taxol cells,

Abstract: Mitotic catastrophe (MC) is a newly identified type of anticancer mechanism for multidrug resistance (MDR) prevention. However, the long cellular death process resulting from MC is not beneficial for anticancer treatment. BZML is a novel colchicine-binding site inhibitor which can overcome MDR by inducing MC; however, BZML-induced MC cells underwent a long cellular death process. Thus, to improve anticancer therapies based on drug-induced MC, BZML-induced MC was served as a model to further study the underlying molecular mechanisms in the process of MC. Here, BZML could induce p53-dependent senescence in A549/Taxol cells, a MDR cell line. This senescence was a secondary effect of MC in overcoming MDR. During MC, BZML-induced destruction of protein-degradation system contributed not only to an increase of p53 protein but also to the accumulation of survivin in nucleus of A549/Taxol cells. Importantly, the nuclear accumulation of survivin was not the inducer but the result of BZML-induced MC, and it promoted the survival of senescent cells. Moreover, it provided additional vulnerability and critical opportunities for sequentially applied therapies. Further, targeting survivin with YM155 accelerated the death of MC cells by timely eliminating therapy-induced senescent cells and strengthening the efficiency of BZML in overcoming MDR in A549/Taxol cells. Collectively, nuclear accumulation of survivin delayed cellular death during MC by promoting the survival of BZML-induced senescent A549/Taxol cells. Moreover, “one-two punch” approach to cancer treatment based on combination therapy with YM155 for survivin suppression might be a new strategy for potentiating MC to overcome MDR.

Abstract: The membrane-bound transcription factor Nrf1 (encoded by Nfe2l1) is activated by sensing glucose deprivation, cholesterol abundance, proteasomal inhibition and oxidative stress and then mediates distinct signaling responses to maintain cellular homeostasis. Herein, we found that Nrf1 stability and transactivity are both enhanced by USP19, a ubiquitin-specific protease tail-anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through its C-terminal transmembrane domain. Further experiments revealed that USP19 directly interacts with Nrf1 in proximity to the ER and topologically acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme to remove ubiquitin moieties from this protein, which allow it to circumvent potential proteasomal degradation. This USP19-mediated effect takes place only after Nrf1 is retro-translocated by p97 out of the ER membrane to dislocate the cytoplasmic side. Conversely, knockout of USP19 causes significant decreases in the abundance of Nrf1 and the entrance of its active isoform into the nucleus, which result in the downregulation of its target proteasomal subunits and a modest reduction in USP19−/−-derived tumor growth in xenograft mice when compared with wild-type controls. Altogether, these results demonstrate that USP19 serves as a novel mechanistic modulator of Nrf1, but not Nrf2, thereby enabling Nrf1 to be rescued from the putative ubiquitin-directed ER-associated degradation pathway. In turn, our additional experimental evidence has revealed that transcriptional expression of endogenous USP19 and its promoter-driven reporter genes is differentially regulated by Nrf2, as well by Nrf1, at distinct layers within a complex hierarchical regulatory network.

Abstract: Exercise-induced physical endurance enhancement and skeletal muscle remodeling can prevent and delay the development of multiple diseases, especially metabolic syndrome. Herein, the study explored the association between glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and exercise, and its effect on skeletal muscle remodeling to enhance endurance capacity. We found both acute exercise and short-term endurance training significantly increased the secretion of GLP-1 in mice. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding Gcg (proglucagon) was used to induce the overexpression of GLP-1 in skeletal muscle of mice. Overexpression of GLP-1 in skeletal muscle enhanced endurance capacity. Meanwhile, glycogen synthesis, glucose uptake, type I fibers proportion, and mitochondrial biogenesis were augmented in GLP-1-AAV skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the in vitro experiment showed that exendin-4 (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) treatment remarkably promoted glucose uptake, type I fibers formation, and mitochondrial respiration. Mechanistically, the knockdown of AMPK could reverse the effects imposed by GLP-1R activation in vitro. Taken together, these results verify that GLP-1 regulates skeletal muscle remodeling to enhance exercise endurance possibly via GLP-1R signaling-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK.
