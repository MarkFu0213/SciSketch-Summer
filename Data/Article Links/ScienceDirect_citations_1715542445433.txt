Abstract: Summary
To assess the effects of acylcarnitine accumulation on muscle insulin sensitivity, a model of muscle acylcarnitine accumulation was generated by deleting carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) specifically from skeletal muscle (Cpt2Sk−/− mice). CPT2 is an irreplaceable enzyme for mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation, converting matrix acylcarnitines to acyl-CoAs. Compared with controls, Cpt2Sk−/− muscles do not accumulate anabolic lipids but do accumulate ∼22-fold more long-chain acylcarnitines. High-fat-fed Cpt2Sk−/− mice resist weight gain, adiposity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and impairments in insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation. Obesity resistance of Cpt2Sk−/− mice could be attributed to increases in lipid excretion via feces, GFD15 production, and energy expenditure. L-carnitine supplement intervention lowers acylcarnitines and improves insulin sensitivity independent of muscle mitochondrial fatty acid oxidative capacity. The loss of muscle CPT2 results in a high degree of long-chain acylcarnitine accumulation, simultaneously protecting against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Complex febrile seizures (FSs) lead to a high risk of intractable temporal lobe epilepsy during adulthood, yet the pathological process of complex FSs is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that activated microglia extensively associated with glutamatergic neuronal soma displace surrounding GABAergic presynapses in complex FSs. Patch-clamp electrophysiology establishes that the microglial displacement of GABAergic presynapses abrogates a complex-FS-induced increase in GABAergic neurotransmission and neuronal excitability, whereas GABA exerts an excitatory action in this immature stage. Pharmacological inhibition of microglial displacement of GABAergic presynapses or selective ablation of microglia in CD11bDTR mice promotes the generation of complex FSs. Blocking or deleting the P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12R) reduces microglial displacement of GABAergic presynapses and shortens the latency of complex FSs. Together, microglial displacement of GABAergic presynapses, regulated by P2Y12R, reduces neuronal excitability to mitigate the generation of complex FSs. Microglial displacement is a protective event during the pathological process of complex FSs.

Abstract: Summary
To understand how neural-immune-associated genes and pathways contribute to neurodegenerative disease pathophysiology, we performed a systematic functional genomic analysis in purified microglia and bulk tissue from mouse and human AD, FTD, and PSP. We uncover a complex temporal trajectory of microglial-immune pathways involving the type 1 interferon response associated with tau pathology in the early stages, followed by later signatures of partial immune suppression and, subsequently, the type 2 interferon response. We find that genetic risk for dementias shows disease-specific patterns of pathway enrichment. We identify drivers of two gene co-expression modules conserved from mouse to human, representing competing arms of microglial-immune activation (NAct) and suppression (NSupp) in neurodegeneration. We validate our findings by using chemogenetics, experimental perturbation data, and single-cell sequencing in post-mortem brains. Our results refine the understanding of stage- and disease-specific microglial responses, implicate microglial viral defense pathways in dementia pathophysiology, and highlight therapeutic windows.

Abstract: Summary
Turbulence facilitates fast energy/information transfer across scales in physical systems. These qualities are important for brain function, but it is currently unknown if the dynamic intrinsic backbone of the brain also exhibits turbulence. Using large-scale neuroimaging empirical data from 1,003 healthy participants, we demonstrate turbulent-like human brain dynamics. Furthermore, we build a whole-brain model with coupled oscillators to demonstrate that the best fit to the data corresponds to a region of maximally developed turbulent-like dynamics, which also corresponds to maximal sensitivity to the processing of external stimulations (information capability). The model shows the economy of anatomy by following the exponential distance rule of anatomical connections as a cost-of-wiring principle. This establishes a firm link between turbulent-like brain activity and optimal brain function. Overall, our results reveal a way of analyzing and modeling whole-brain dynamics that suggests a turbulent-like dynamic intrinsic backbone facilitating large-scale network communication.

Abstract: Summary
The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is essential for metazoan development but has been refractory to biochemical analysis. We present an integrated analysis of the native mammalian NuRD complex, combining quantitative mass spectrometry, cross-linking, protein biochemistry, and electron microscopy to define the architecture of the complex. NuRD is built from a 2:2:4 (MTA, HDAC, and RBBP) deacetylase module and a 1:1:1 (MBD, GATAD2, and Chromodomain-Helicase-DNA-binding [CHD]) remodeling module, and the complex displays considerable structural dynamics. The enigmatic GATAD2 controls the asymmetry of the complex and directly recruits the CHD remodeler. The MTA-MBD interaction acts as a point of functional switching, with the transcriptional regulator PWWP2A competing with MBD for binding to the MTA-HDAC-RBBP subcomplex. Overall, our data address the long-running controversy over NuRD stoichiometry, provide imaging of the mammalian NuRD complex, and establish the biochemical mechanism by which PWWP2A can regulate NuRD composition.

Abstract: Summary
Exposure to excessive sound causes noise-induced hearing loss through complex mechanisms and represents a common and unmet neurological condition. We investigate how noise insults affect the cochlea with proteomics and functional assays. Quantitative proteomics reveals that exposure to loud noise causes proteotoxicity. We identify and confirm hundreds of proteins that accumulate, including cytoskeletal proteins, and several nodes of the proteostasis network. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that a subset of the genes encoding these proteins also increases acutely after noise exposure, including numerous proteasome subunits. Global cochlear protein ubiquitylation levels build up after exposure to excess noise, and we map numerous posttranslationally modified lysines residues. Several collagen proteins decrease in abundance, and Col9a1 specifically localizes to pillar cell heads. After two weeks of recovery, the cochlea selectively elevates the abundance of the protein synthesis machinery. We report that overstimulation of the auditory system drives a robust cochlear proteotoxic stress response.

Abstract: Summary
The role of RNA binding proteins in regulating the phagocytic and cytokine-releasing functions of microglia is unknown. Here, we show that microglia deficient for the QUAKING (QKI) RNA binding protein have increased proinflammatory cytokine release and defects in processing phagocytosed cargo. Splicing analysis reveals a role for QKI in regulating microexon networks of the Rho GTPase pathway. We show an increase in RhoA activation and proinflammatory cytokines in QKI-deficient microglia that are repressed by treating with a Rock kinase inhibitor. During the cuprizone diet, mice with QKI-deficient microglia are inefficient at supporting central nervous system (CNS) remyelination and cause the recruited oligodendrocyte precursor cells to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, the expression of QKI in microglia is downregulated in preactive, chronic active, and remyelinating white matter lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Overall, our findings identify QKI as an alternative splicing regulator governing a network of Rho GTPase microexons with implications for CNS remyelination and MS patients.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic SMC complexes, cohesin, condensin, and Smc5/6, use ATP hydrolysis to power a plethora of functions requiring organization and restructuring of eukaryotic chromosomes in interphase and during mitosis. The Smc5/6 mechanism of action and its activity on DNA are largely unknown. Here we purified the budding yeast Smc5/6 holocomplex and characterized its core biochemical and biophysical activities. Purified Smc5/6 exhibits DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and SUMO E3 ligase activity. We show that Smc5/6 binds DNA topologically with affinity for supercoiled and catenated DNA templates. Employing single-molecule assays to analyze the functional and dynamic characteristics of Smc5/6 bound to DNA, we show that Smc5/6 locks DNA plectonemes and can compact DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex recognizes DNA tertiary structures involving juxtaposed helices and might modulate DNA topology by plectoneme stabilization and local compaction.

Abstract: Summary
Breathing is coupled to metabolism. Leptin, a peptide mainly secreted in proportion to adipose tissue mass, increases energy expenditure with a parallel increase in breathing. We demonstrate that optogenetic activation of LepRb neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) mimics the respiratory stimulation after systemic leptin administration. We show that leptin activates the sodium leak channel (NALCN), thereby depolarizing a subset of glutamatergic (VGluT2) LepRb NTS neurons expressing galanin. Mice with selective deletion of NALCN in LepRb neurons have increased breathing irregularity and central apneas. On a high-fat diet, these mice gain weight with an associated depression of minute ventilation and tidal volume, which are not detected in control littermates. Anatomical mapping reveals LepRb NTS-originating glutamatergic axon terminals in a brainstem inspiratory premotor region (rVRG) and dorsomedial hypothalamus. These findings directly link a defined subset of NTS LepRb cells to the matching of ventilation to energy balance.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular RNAs present in biofluids have emerged as potential biomarkers for disease. Where most studies focus on blood-derived fluids, other biofluids may be more informative. We present an atlas of messenger, circular, and small RNA transcriptomes of a comprehensive collection of 20 human biofluids. By means of synthetic spike-in controls, we compare RNA content across biofluids, revealing a 10,000-fold difference in concentration. The circular RNA fraction is increased in most biofluids compared to tissues. Each biofluid transcriptome is enriched for RNA molecules derived from specific tissues and cell types. Our atlas enables an informed selection of the most relevant biofluid to monitor particular diseases. To verify the biomarker potential in these biofluids, four validation cohorts representing a broad spectrum of diseases were profiled, revealing numerous differential RNAs between case and control subjects. Spike-normalized data are publicly available in the R2 web portal for further exploration.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-associated mutations that stabilize NRF2, an oxidant defense transcription factor, are predicted to promote tumor development. Here, utilizing 3D cancer spheroid models coupled with CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we investigate the molecular pathogenesis mediated by NRF2 hyperactivation. NRF2 hyperactivation was necessary for proliferation and survival in lung tumor spheroids. Antioxidant treatment rescued survival but not proliferation, suggesting the presence of distinct mechanisms. CRISPR screens revealed that spheroids are differentially dependent on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) for proliferation and the lipid peroxidase GPX4 for protection from ferroptosis of inner, matrix-deprived cells. Ferroptosis inhibitors blocked death from NRF2 downregulation, demonstrating a critical role of NRF2 in protecting matrix-deprived cells from ferroptosis. Interestingly, proteomics analyses show global enrichment of selenoproteins, including GPX4, by NRF2 downregulation, and targeting NRF2 and GPX4 killed spheroids overall. These results illustrate the value of spheroid culture in revealing environmental or spatial differential dependencies on NRF2 and reveal exploitable vulnerabilities of NRF2-hyperactivated tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The germinal center (GC) reaction is essential for long-lived humoral immunity. However, molecular requirements for the induction of Bcl6, the master regulator for GC B cell differentiation, remain unclear. Through screening for cytokines and other stimuli that regulate Bcl6 expression, we identify IL-4 as the strongest inducer. IL-4 signaling alters the metabolomic profile in activated B cells and induces accumulation of the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate (αKG), which is required for activation of the Bcl6 gene locus. Mechanistically, after IL-4 treatment, STAT6 bound to the known enhancers in the Bcl6 locus recruits UTX, a demethylase for the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 that requires αKG as a cofactor. In turn, the H3K27me3 demethylation activates the enhancers and transcription of the Bcl6 gene. We propose that IL-4-mediated metabolic reprogramming in B cells is pivotal for epigenomic activation of Bcl6 expression to promote GC B cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria constantly adapt to the metabolic needs of a cell. This mitochondrial plasticity is critical to T cells, which modulate metabolism depending on antigen-driven signals and environment. We show here that de novo synthesis of the mitochondrial membrane-specific lipid cardiolipin maintains CD8+ T cell function. T cells deficient for the cardiolipin-synthesizing enzyme PTPMT1 had reduced cardiolipin and responded poorly to antigen because basal cardiolipin levels were required for activation. However, neither de novo cardiolipin synthesis, nor its Tafazzin-dependent remodeling, was needed for T cell activation. In contrast, PTPMT1-dependent cardiolipin synthesis was vital when mitochondrial fitness was required, most notably during memory T cell differentiation or nutrient stress. We also found CD8+ T cell defects in a small cohort of patients with Barth syndrome, where TAFAZZIN is mutated, and in a Tafazzin-deficient mouse model. Thus, the dynamic regulation of a single mitochondrial lipid is crucial for CD8+ T cell immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms that control mobilization of cytosolic calcium [Ca2+]i are key for regulation of numerous eukaryotic cell functions. One such paradigmatic mechanism involves activation of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) enzymes by G protein βγ subunits from activated Gαi-Gβγ heterotrimers. Here, we report identification of a master switch to enable this control for PLCβ enzymes in living cells. We find that the Gαi-Gβγ-PLCβ-Ca2+ signaling module is entirely dependent on the presence of active Gαq. If Gαq is pharmacologically inhibited or genetically ablated, Gβγ can bind to PLCβ but does not elicit Ca2+ signals. Removal of an auto-inhibitory linker that occludes the active site of the enzyme is required and sufficient to empower “stand-alone control” of PLCβ by Gβγ. This dependence of Gi-Gβγ-Ca2+ on Gαq places an entire signaling branch of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) under hierarchical control of Gq and changes our understanding of how Gi-GPCRs trigger [Ca2+]i via PLCβ enzymes.

Abstract: Summary
The balance of phospho-signaling at the outer kinetochore is critical for forming accurate attachments between kinetochores and the mitotic spindle and timely exit from mitosis. A major player in determining this balance is the PP2A-B56 phosphatase, which is recruited to the kinase attachment regulatory domain (KARD) of budding uninhibited by benzimidazole 1-related 1 (BUBR1) in a phospho-dependent manner. This unleashes a rapid, switch-like phosphatase relay that reverses mitotic phosphorylation at the kinetochore, extinguishing the checkpoint and promoting anaphase. Here, we demonstrate that the C-terminal pseudokinase domain of human BUBR1 is required to promote KARD phosphorylation. Mutation or removal of the pseudokinase domain results in decreased PP2A-B56 recruitment to the outer kinetochore attenuated checkpoint silencing and errors in chromosome alignment as a result of imbalance in Aurora B activity. Our data, therefore, elucidate a function for the BUBR1 pseudokinase domain in ensuring accurate and timely exit from mitosis.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) regulates the macrophage metabolic state to thrive in the host, yet the responsible mechanisms remain elusive. Macrophage activation toward the microbicidal (M1) program depends on the HIF-1α-mediated metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) toward glycolysis. Here, we ask whether a tuberculosis (TB) microenvironment changes the M1 macrophage metabolic state. We expose M1 macrophages to the acellular fraction of tuberculous pleural effusions (TB-PEs) and find lower glycolytic activity, accompanied by elevated levels of OXPHOS and bacillary load, compared to controls. The eicosanoid fraction of TB-PE drives these metabolic alterations. HIF-1α stabilization reverts the effect of TB-PE by restoring M1 metabolism. Furthermore, Mtb-infected mice with stabilized HIF-1α display lower bacillary loads and a pronounced M1-like metabolic profile in alveolar macrophages (AMs). Collectively, we demonstrate that lipids from a TB-associated microenvironment alter the M1 macrophage metabolic reprogramming by hampering HIF-1α functions, thereby impairing control of Mtb infection.

Abstract: Summary
Nerve injury in somatosensory pathways may lead to neuropathic pain, which affects the life quality of ∼8% of people. Long-term enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission along somatosensory pathways contributes to neuropathic pain. Caspase 3 (Casp3) plays a non-apoptotic role in the hippocampus and regulates internalization of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunits. Whether Casp3-AMPAR interaction is involved in the maintenance of peripheral hypersensitivity after nerve injury remained unknown. Here, we show that nerve injury suppresses long-term depression (LTD) and downregulates Casp3 in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Interfering with interactions between Casp3 and AMPAR subunits or reducing Casp3 activity in the ACC suppresses LTD induction and causes peripheral hypersensitivity. Overexpression of Casp3 restores LTD and reduces peripheral hypersensitivity after nerve injury. We reveal how Casp3 is involved in the maintenance of peripheral hypersensitivity. Our findings suggest that restoration of LTD via Casp3 provides a therapeutic strategy for neuropathic pain management.

Abstract: Cell walls are essential in the interaction of fungi with the (a)biotic environment and are also key to hyphal morphogenesis and mechanical strength. Here, we used solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy combined with HPLC and GC–MS to study the structural organization of the cell wall of a representative of the Basidiomycota, one of the two main phyla of fungi. Based on the data we propose a refined model for the cell wall of a basidiomycete. In this model, the rigid core is built from α- and β-(1,3)-glucan, β-(1,3)-(1,6)-glucan, highly branched and single stranded β-(1,4)-chitin as well as polymeric fucose. The mobile fraction of the cell wall is composed of β-(1,3)-glucan, β-(1,3)-(1,6)-glucan, β-(1,6)-glucan, α-linked reducing and non-reducing ends and polymeric mannose. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the structural organization of the cell wall of the model basidiomycete S. commune that was previously based on destructive chemical and enzymatic analysis.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic β cell failure is key to type 2 diabetes (T2D) onset and progression. Here, we assess whether human β cell dysfunction induced by metabolic stress is reversible, evaluate the molecular pathways underlying persistent or transient damage, and explore the relationships with T2D islet traits. Twenty-six islet preparations are exposed to several lipotoxic/glucotoxic conditions, some of which impair insulin release, depending on stressor type, concentration, and combination. The reversal of dysfunction occurs after washout for some, although not all, of the lipoglucotoxic insults. Islet transcriptomes assessed by RNA sequencing and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis identify specific pathways underlying β cell failure and recovery. Comparison of a large number of human T2D islet transcriptomes with those of persistent or reversible β cell lipoglucotoxicity show shared gene expression signatures. The identification of mechanisms associated with human β cell dysfunction and recovery and their overlap with T2D islet traits provide insights into T2D pathogenesis, fostering the development of improved β cell-targeted therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Angiotensin II (AngII) is a peptide hormone that affects the cardiovascular system, not only through typical effects on the vasculature, kidneys, and heart, but also through less understood roles mediated by the brain and the immune system. Here, we address the hard-wired neural connections within the autonomic nervous system that modulate splenic immunity. Chronic AngII infusion triggers burst firing of the vagus nerve celiac efferent, an effect correlated with noradrenergic activation in the spleen and T cell egress. Bioelectronic stimulation of the celiac vagus nerve, in the absence of other challenges and independently from afferent signals to the brain, evokes the noradrenergic splenic pathway to promote release of a growth factor mediating neuroimmune crosstalk, placental growth factor (PlGF), and egress of CD8 effector T cells. Our findings also indicate that the neuroimmune interface mediated by PlGF and necessary for transducing the neural signal into an effective immune response is dependent on α-adrenergic receptor signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Cohesin, a critical mediator of genome organization including sister chromatid cohesion, is a ring-shaped multi-subunit ATPase that topologically embraces DNA. Its loading and function on chromosomes require the Scc2-Scc4 loader. Using biochemical reconstitution, we show here that the ability of the loader to bind DNA plays a critical role in promoting cohesin loading. Two distinct sites within the Mis4Scc2 subunit are found to cooperatively bind DNA. Mis4Scc2 initially forms a tertiary complex with cohesin on DNA and promotes subsequent topological DNA entrapment by cohesin through its DNA binding activity, a process that requires an additional DNA binding surface provided by Psm3Smc3, the ATPase domain of cohesin. Furthermore, we show that mutations in the two DNA binding sites of Mis4 impair the chromosomal loading of cohesin. These observations demonstrate the physiological importance of DNA binding by the loader and provide mechanistic insights into the process of topological cohesin loading.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) trafficking affects multiple brain functions, such as learning and memory. We have previously shown that Thorase plays an important role in the internalization of AMPARs from the synaptic membrane. Here, we show that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation leads to increased S-nitrosylation of Thorase and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF). S-nitrosylation of Thorase stabilizes Thorase-AMPAR complexes and enhances the internalization of AMPAR and interaction with protein-interacting C kinase 1 (PICK1). S-nitrosylated NSF is dependent on the S-nitrosylation of Thorase via trans-nitrosylation, which modulates the surface insertion of AMPARs. In the presence of the S-nitrosylation-deficient C137L Thorase mutant, AMPAR trafficking, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression are impaired. Overall, our data suggest that both S-nitrosylation and interactions of Thorase and NSF/PICK1 are required to modulate AMPAR-mediated synaptic plasticity. This study provides critical information that elucidates the mechanism underlying Thorase and NSF-mediated trafficking of AMPAR complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Many gene products exhibit great structural heterogeneity because of an array of modifications. These modifications are not directly encoded in the genomic template but often affect the functionality of proteins. Protein glycosylation plays a vital role in proper protein functions. However, the analysis of glycoproteins has been challenging compared with other protein modifications, such as phosphorylation. Here, we perform an integrated proteomic and glycoproteomic analysis of 83 prospectively collected high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) and 23 non-tumor tissues. Integration of the expression data from global proteomics and glycoproteomics reveals tumor-specific glycosylation, uncovers different glycosylation associated with three tumor clusters, and identifies glycosylation enzymes that were correlated with the altered glycosylation. In addition to providing a valuable resource, these results provide insights into the potential roles of glycosylation in the pathogenesis of HGSC, with the possibility of distinguishing pathological outcomes of ovarian tumors from non-tumors, as well as classifying tumor clusters.

Abstract: Summary
Transgenerational immune priming (TGIP) allows memory-like immune responses to be transmitted from parents to offspring in many invertebrates. Despite increasing evidence for TGIP in insects, the mechanisms involved in the transfer of information remain largely unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti transmit antiviral immunological memory to their progeny that lasts throughout generations. We observe that TGIP, which is virus and sequence specific but RNAi independent, is initiated by a single exposure to disparate RNA viruses and also by inoculation of a fragment of viral double-stranded RNA. The progeny, which inherit a viral DNA that is only a fragment of the viral RNA used to infect the parents, display enriched expression of genes related to chromatin and DNA binding. These findings represent a demonstration of TGIP for RNA viruses in invertebrates, broadly increasing our understanding of the immune response, host genome plasticity, and antiviral memory of the germline.

Abstract: Summary
Energetic metabolism reprogramming is critical for cancer and immune responses. Current methods to functionally profile the global metabolic capacities and dependencies of cells are performed in bulk. We designed a simple method for complex metabolic profiling called SCENITH, for single-cell energetic metabolism by profiling translation inhibition. SCENITH allows for the study of metabolic responses in multiple cell types in parallel by flow cytometry. SCENITH is designed to perform metabolic studies ex vivo, particularly for rare cells in whole blood samples, avoiding metabolic biases introduced by culture media. We analyzed myeloid cells in solid tumors from patients and identified variable metabolic profiles, in ways that are not linked to their lineage or their activation phenotype. SCENITH’s ability to reveal global metabolic functions and determine complex and linked immune-phenotypes in rare cell subpopulations will contribute to the information needed for evaluating therapeutic responses or patient stratification.

Abstract: Summary
Vesicular- or vacuolar-type adenosine triphosphatases (V-ATPases) are ATP-driven proton pumps comprised of a cytoplasmic V1 complex for ATP hydrolysis and a membrane-embedded Vo complex for proton transfer. They play important roles in acidification of intracellular vesicles, organelles, and the extracellular milieu in eukaryotes. Here, we report cryoelectron microscopy structures of human V-ATPase in three rotational states at up to 2.9-Å resolution. Aided by mass spectrometry, we build all known protein subunits with associated N-linked glycans and identify glycolipids and phospholipids in the Vo complex. We define ATP6AP1 as a structural hub for Vo complex assembly because it connects to multiple Vo subunits and phospholipids in the c-ring. The glycolipids and the glycosylated Vo subunits form a luminal glycan coat critical for V-ATPase folding, localization, and stability. This study identifies mechanisms of V-ATPase assembly and biogenesis that rely on the integrated roles of ATP6AP1, glycans, and lipids.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cell infiltration of solid tumors often correlates with poor prognosis, but their tumor-suppressive function lacks mechanistic understanding. Through a combination of transgenic mice, cell fate mapping, adoptive transfer, and co-injection strategies, we demonstrate that Treg cell ablation-dependent anti-tumor effects in murine breast cancer require intratumoral recruitment of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes, which primarily differentiate into tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and lead to reprogramming of their function in an IFN-γ-dependent manner. Furthermore, transcriptomic signatures from murine TAMs in Treg cell-ablated conditions correlate with increased overall survival in human breast cancer. Our studies highlight the strong myeloid dependency of breast cancer and provide the basis for the development of therapeutic strategies based on manipulation of the IFN-γ signaling pathway in monocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Integrated multi-omics evaluation of 823 tumors from advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients identifies molecular subsets associated with differential clinical outcomes to angiogenesis blockade alone or with a checkpoint inhibitor. Unsupervised transcriptomic analysis reveals seven molecular subsets with distinct angiogenesis, immune, cell-cycle, metabolism, and stromal programs. While sunitinib and atezolizumab + bevacizumab are effective in subsets with high angiogenesis, atezolizumab + bevacizumab improves clinical benefit in tumors with high T-effector and/or cell-cycle transcription. Somatic mutations in PBRM1 and KDM5C associate with high angiogenesis and AMPK/fatty acid oxidation gene expression, while CDKN2A/B and TP53 alterations associate with increased cell-cycle and anabolic metabolism. Sarcomatoid tumors exhibit lower prevalence of PBRM1 mutations and angiogenesis markers, frequent CDKN2A/B alterations, and increased PD-L1 expression. These findings can be applied to molecularly stratify patients, explain improved outcomes of sarcomatoid tumors to checkpoint blockade versus antiangiogenics alone, and develop personalized therapies in RCC and other indications.

Abstract: Summary
Human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative pathogen of the COVID-19 pandemic, exerts a massive health and socioeconomic crisis. The virus infects alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2s), leading to lung injury and impaired gas exchange, but the mechanisms driving infection and pathology are unclear. We performed a quantitative phosphoproteomic survey of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived AT2s (iAT2s) infected with SARS-CoV-2 at air-liquid interface (ALI). Time course analysis revealed rapid remodeling of diverse host systems, including signaling, RNA processing, translation, metabolism, nuclear integrity, protein trafficking, and cytoskeletal-microtubule organization, leading to cell cycle arrest, genotoxic stress, and innate immunity. Comparison to analogous data from transformed cell lines revealed respiratory-specific processes hijacked by SARS-CoV-2, highlighting potential novel therapeutic avenues that were validated by a high hit rate in a targeted small molecule screen in our iAT2 ALI system.

Abstract: Summary
The secreted factor Nodal, known as a major left determinant, is associated with severe heart defects. Yet, it has been unclear how it regulates asymmetric morphogenesis such as heart looping, which align cardiac chambers to establish the double blood circulation. Here, we report that Nodal is transiently active in precursors of the mouse heart tube poles, before looping. In conditional mutants, we show that Nodal is not required to initiate asymmetric morphogenesis. We provide evidence of a heart-specific random generator of asymmetry that is independent of Nodal. Using 3D quantifications and simulations, we demonstrate that Nodal functions as a bias of this mechanism: it is required to amplify and coordinate opposed left-right asymmetries at the heart tube poles, thus generating a robust helical shape. We identify downstream effectors of Nodal signaling, regulating asymmetries in cell proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix composition. Our study uncovers how Nodal regulates asymmetric organogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS), upon sensing cytosolic DNA, catalyzes the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), which activates STING-TBK1-IRF3 signaling. cGAS is also present in the nucleus, but the relevant nuclear function or mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we report that nuclear cGAS is indispensable for inducing cytokines and chemokines triggered by RNA/DNA viruses. Unexpectedly, the DNA-binding/nucleotidyltransferase activity of cGAS is dispensable for RNA-virus-induced genes expression. cGAS deficiency does not affect the phosphorylation, dimerization, or nuclear translocation of IRF3 induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Mechanistically, nuclear-localized cGAS interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (Prmt5), which catalyzes the symmetric dimethylation of histone H3 arginine 2 at Ifnb and Ifna4 promoters, thus facilitating the access of IRF3. Deficiency of Prmt5 or disrupting its catalytic activity suppresses the production of type I interferons (IFNs), impairing the host defenses against RNA/DNA virus infections. Taken together, our study uncovers a non-canonical function of nuclear-localized cGAS in innate immunity via regulating histone arginine modification.

Abstract: Despite the importance of fungal cell walls as the principle determinant of fungal morphology and the defining element determining fungal interactions with other cells, few scalar models have been developed that reconcile chemical and microscopic attributes of its structure. The cell wall of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans is comprised of an amorphous inner skeletal layer of β(1,3)- and β(1,6)-glucan and chitin and an outer fibrillar layer thought to be dominated by highly mannosylated cell wall proteins. The architecture of these two layers can be resolved at the electron microscopy level, but the visualised structure of the wall has not yet been defined precisely in chemical terms. We have therefore examined the precise structure, location and molecular sizes of the cell wall components using transmission electron microscopy and tomography and tested predictions of the cell wall models using mutants and agents that perturb the normal cell wall structure. We demonstrate that the fibrils are comprised of a frond of N-linked outer chain mannans linked to a basal layer of GPI-proteins concentrated in the mid-wall region and that the non-elastic chitin microfibrils are cantilevered with sufficient lengths of non-fibrillar chitin and/or β-glucan to enable the chitin-glucan cage to flex, e.g. during morphogenesis and osmotic swelling. We present the first three-dimensional nano-scalar model of the C. albicans cell wall which can be used to test hypotheses relating to the structure–function relationships that underpin the pathobiology of this fungal pathogen.

To address how genetic variation alters gene expression in complex cell mixtures, we developed direct nuclear tagmentation and RNA sequencing (DNTR-seq), which enables whole-genome and mRNA sequencing jointly in single cells. DNTR-seq readily identified minor subclones within leukemia patients. In a large-scale DNA damage screen, DNTR-seq was used to detect regions under purifying selection and identified genes where mRNA abundance was resistant to copy-number alteration, suggesting strong genetic compensation. mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) quality equals RNA-only methods, and the low positional bias of genomic libraries allowed detection of sub-megabase aberrations at ultra-low coverage. Each cell library is individually addressable and can be re-sequenced at increased depth, allowing multi-tiered study designs. Additionally, the direct tagmentation protocol enables coverage-independent estimation of ploidy, which can be used to identify cell singlets. Thus, DNTR-seq directly links each cell’s state to its corresponding genome at scale, enabling routine analysis of heterogeneous tumors and other complex tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Stressful experiences early in life can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, it remains largely unknown how stress influences susceptibility to the disease onset. Here, we show that exposure to brain-processed stress disrupts myocardial growth by reducing cardiomyocyte mitotic activity. Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the primary stress response pathway, reduces cardiomyocyte numbers, disrupts trabecular formation, and leads to contractile dysfunction of the developing myocardium. However, a physiological level of GR signaling is required to prevent cardiomyocyte hyperproliferation. Mechanistically, we identify an antagonistic interaction between the GR and the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) as a key player in cardiac development. IL-4 signals transcription of key regulators of cell-cycle progression in cardiomyocytes via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). GR, on the contrary, inhibits this signaling system. Thus, our findings uncover an interplay between stress and immune signaling pathways critical to orchestrating physiological growth of the heart.

Abstract: Summary
Follicular mature (FM) and germinal center (GC) B cells underpin humoral immunity, but the dynamics of their generation and maintenance are not clearly defined. Here, we exploited a fate-mapping system in mice that tracks B cells as they develop into peripheral subsets, together with a cell division fate reporter mouse and mathematical models. We find that FM cells are kinetically homogeneous, recirculate freely, are continually replenished from transitional populations, and self-renew rarely. In contrast, GC B cell lineages persist for weeks with rapid turnover and site-specific dynamics. Those in the spleen derive from transitional cells and are kinetically homogeneous, while those in lymph nodes derive from FM B cells and comprise both transient and persistent clones. These differences likely derive from the nature of antigen exposure at the different sites. Our integrative approach also reveals how the host environment drives cell-extrinsic, age-related changes in B cell homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear import receptors, also called importins, mediate nuclear import of proteins and chaperone aggregation-prone cargoes (e.g., neurodegeneration-linked RNA-binding proteins [RBPs]) in the cytoplasm. Importins were identified as modulators of cellular toxicity elicited by arginine-rich dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), an aberrant protein species found in C9orf72-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mechanistically, the link between importins and arginine-rich DPRs remains unclear. Here, we show that arginine-rich DPRs (poly-GR and poly-PR) bind directly to multiple importins and, in excess, promote their insolubility and condensation. In cells, poly-GR impairs Impα/β-mediated nuclear import, including import of TDP-43, an RBP that aggregates in C9orf72-ALS/FTD patients. Arginine-rich DPRs promote phase separation and insolubility of TDP-43 in vitro and in cells, and this pathological interaction is suppressed by elevating importin concentrations. Our findings suggest that importins can decrease toxicity of arginine-rich DPRs by suppressing their pathological interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Maximizing the potential of human kidney organoids for drug testing and regenerative medicine and to model development and disease requires addressing cell immaturity, the lack of a mature collecting system, and off-target cell types. By independently generating two kidney progenitor cell populations—metanephric mesenchyme and ureteric bud (UB)-like cells—we could generate kidney organoids with a collecting system. We also identify the hormones aldosterone and arginine vasopressin (AVP) as critical to promote differentiation of collecting duct cell types including both principal cells (PCs) and intercalated cells (ICs). The resulting PCs express aquaporin-2 (AQP2) protein, which undergoes translocation to the apical membrane after vasopressin or forskolin stimulation. By single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we demonstrate improved proximal tubule maturation and reduced off-target cell populations. We also show appropriate downregulation of progenitor cell types, improved modeling of tubular injury, the presence of urothelium (Uro), and the ability of Notch pathway modulation to regulate PC:IC ratios during organoid development.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and their metabolites are strongly positively associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Bariatric surgery is among the best treatments for weight loss and associated morbidities. Clinical studies have reported that bariatric surgery decreases the circulating levels of BCAAs. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that reduced BCAA levels contribute to the metabolic improvements of sustained weight loss and improved glucose tolerance after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). We find that, as in humans, circulating BCAAs are significantly lower in VSG rats and mice. To increase circulating BCAAs, we tested mice with either increased dietary intake of BCAAs or impaired BCAA catabolism by total body deletion of mitochondrial phosphatase 2C (Pp2cm). Our results show that a decrease in circulating BCAAs is not necessary for sustained body weight loss and improved glucose tolerance after VSG.

Abstract: Summary
CENP-A incorporation is critical for centromere specification and is mediated by the chaperone HJURP. The CENP-A-targeting domain (CATD) of CENP-A specifically binds to HJURP, and this binding is conserved. However, the binding interface of CENP-A-HJURP is yet to be understood. Here, we identify the critical residues for chicken CENP-A or HJURP. The A59Q mutation in the α1-helix of chicken CENP-A causes CENP-A mis-incorporation and subsequent cell death, whereas the corresponding mutation in human CENP-A does not. We also find that W53 of HJURP, which is a contact site of A59 in CENP-A, is also essential in chicken cells. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the affinities of HJURP to CATD differ between chickens and humans. However, the introduction of two arginine residues to the chicken HJURP αA-helix suppresses CENP-A mis-incorporation in chicken cells expressing CENP-AA59Q. Our data explain the mechanisms and evolution of CENP-A essentiality by the CENP-A-HJURP interaction.

Abstract: Summary
Although maternal exercise (ME) becomes increasingly uncommon, the effects of ME on offspring muscle metabolic health remain largely undefined. Maternal mice are subject to daily exercise during pregnancy, which enhances mitochondrial biogenesis during fetal muscle development; this is correlated with higher mitochondrial content and oxidative muscle fibers in offspring muscle and improved endurance capacity. Apelin, an exerkine, is elevated due to ME, and maternal apelin administration mirrors the effect of ME on mitochondrial biogenesis in fetal muscle. Importantly, both ME and apelin induce DNA demethylation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (Ppargc1a) promoter and enhance its expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in fetal muscle. Such changes in DNA methylation were maintained in offspring, with ME offspring muscle expressing higher levels of PGC-1α1/4 isoforms, explaining improved muscle function. In summary, ME enhances DNA demethylation of the Ppargc1a promoter in fetal muscle, which has positive programming effects on the exercise endurance capacity and protects offspring muscle against metabolic dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Getting large macromolecules through the plasma membrane and endosomal barriers remains a major challenge. Here, we report a generalizable method of delivering proteins and ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to cells in vitro and mouse liver tissue in vivo with engineered ectosomes. These ectosomes, referred to as “Gectosomes,” are designed to co-encapsulate vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) with bioactive macromolecules via split GFP complementation. We found that this method enables active cargo loading, improves the specific activity of cargo delivery, and facilitates Gectosome purification. Experimental and mathematical modeling analyses suggest that active cargo loading reduces non-specific encapsulation of cellular proteins, particularly nucleic-acid-binding proteins. Using Gectosomes that encapsulate Cre, Ago2, and SaCas9, we demonstrate their ability to execute designed modifications of endogenous genes in cell lines in vitro and mouse liver tissue in vivo, paving the way toward applications of this technology for the treatment of a wide range of human diseases.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T cells regulate inflammation and metabolism in obesity. An imbalance of CD4+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) is critical in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Although cytokine control of this process is well understood, transcriptional regulation is not. KLF10, a member of the Kruppel-like transcription factor family, is an emerging regulator of immune cell function. We generated CD4+-T-cell-specific KLF10 knockout (TKO) mice and identified a predisposition to obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver due to defects of CD4+ Treg mobilization to liver and adipose tissue depots and decreased transforming growth factor β3 (TGF-β3) release in vitro and in vivo. Adoptive transfer of wild-type CD4+ Tregs fully rescued obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver. Mechanistically, TKO Tregs exhibit reduced mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mTOR signaling, and consequently impaired chemotactic properties. Collectively, our study identifies CD4+ T cell KLF10 as an essential regulator of obesity and insulin resistance by altering Treg metabolism and mobilization.

WDR82/PNUTS-PP1 Prevents Transcription-Replication Conflicts by Promoting RNA Polymerase II Degradation on Chromatin,

Abstract: Summary
Transcription-replication (T-R) conflicts cause replication stress and loss of genome integrity. However, the transcription-related processes that restrain such conflicts are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) nuclear targeting subunit (PNUTS)-PP1 inhibits replication stress. Depletion of PNUTS causes lower EdU uptake, S phase accumulation, and slower replication fork rates. In addition, the PNUTS binding partner WDR82 also promotes RNAPII-CTD dephosphorylation and suppresses replication stress. RNAPII has a longer residence time on chromatin after depletion of PNUTS or WDR82. Furthermore, the RNAPII residence time is greatly enhanced by proteasome inhibition in control cells but less so in PNUTS- or WDR82-depleted cells, indicating that PNUTS and WDR82 promote degradation of RNAPII on chromatin. Notably, reduced replication is dependent on transcription and the phospho-CTD binding protein CDC73 after depletion of PNUTS/WDR82. Altogether, our results suggest that RNAPII-CTD dephosphorylation is required for the continuous turnover of RNAPII on chromatin, thereby preventing T-R conflicts.

Abstract: Summary
We report a serum-free, 3D murine artificial thymic organoid (M-ATO) system that mimics normal murine thymopoiesis with the production of all T cell stages, from early thymic progenitors to functional single-positive (CD8SP and CD4SP) TCRαβ and TCRγδ cells. RNA sequencing aligns M-ATO-derived populations with phenotypically identical primary thymocytes. M-ATOs initiated with Rag1−/− marrow produce the same differentiation block as seen in the endogenous thymus, and Notch signaling patterns in M-ATOs mirror primary thymopoiesis. M-ATOs initiated with defined hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and lymphoid progenitors from marrow and thymus generate each of the downstream differentiation stages, allowing the kinetics of T cell differentiation to be tracked. Remarkably, single HSCs deposited into each M-ATO generate the complete trajectory of T cell differentiation, producing diverse TCR repertoires across clones that largely match endogenous thymus. M-ATOs represent a highly reproducible and efficient experimental platform for the interrogation of clonal thymopoiesis from HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the effects of microgravity on human organs is crucial to exploration of low-earth orbit, the moon, and beyond. Drosophila can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling and diminished output. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric/extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression, consistent with the observed compromised, smaller hearts and suggesting abnormal proteostasis. This was examined further on a second flight in which we found dramatically elevated proteasome aggregates co-localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ deposits. Remarkably, in long-QT causing sei/hERG mutants, proteasomal gene expression at 1g, although less than the wild-type expression, was nevertheless increased in microgravity. Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be a fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial infection triggers a cytokine storm that needs to be resolved to maintain the host’s wellbeing. Here, we report that ablation of m6A methyltransferase subunit METTL14 in myeloid cells exacerbates macrophage responses to acute bacterial infection in mice, leading to high mortality due to sustained production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. METTL14 depletion blunts Socs1 m6A methylation and reduces YTHDF1 binding to the m6A sites, which diminishes SOCS1 induction leading to the overactivation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling. Forced expression of SOCS1 in macrophages depleted of METTL14 or YTHDF1 rescues the hyper-responsive phenotype of these macrophages in vitro and in vivo. We further show that LPS treatment induces Socs1 m6A methylation and sustains SOCS1 induction by promoting Fto mRNA degradation, and forced FTO expression in macrophages mimics the phenotype of METTL14-depleted macrophages. We conclude that m6A methylation-mediated SOCS1 induction is required to maintain the negative feedback control of macrophage activation in response to bacterial infection.

Abstract: Summary
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin play critical roles in organizing mammalian genomes into topologically associating domains (TADs). Here, by combining genetic engineering with quantitative super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, we demonstrate that in living cells, CTCF forms clusters typically containing 2–8 molecules. A fraction of CTCF clusters, enriched for those with ≥3 molecules, are coupled with cohesin complexes with a characteristic physical distance suggestive of a defined molecular interaction. Acute degradation of the cohesin unloader WAPL or transcriptional inhibition (TI) result in increased CTCF clustering. Furthermore, the effect of TI on CTCF clusters is alleviated by the acute loss of the cohesin subunit SMC3. Our study provides quantitative characterization of CTCF clusters in living cells, uncovers the opposing effects of cohesin and transcription on CTCF clustering, and highlights the power of quantitative super-resolution microscopy as a tool to bridge the gap between biochemical and genomic methodologies in chromatin research.

Abstract: Summary
The adult mammalian heart has limited capacity for regeneration following injury, whereas the neonatal heart can readily regenerate within a short period after birth. Neonatal heart regeneration is orchestrated by multiple cell types intrinsic to the heart, as well as immune cells that infiltrate the heart after injury. To elucidate the transcriptional responses of the different cellular components of the mouse heart following injury, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on neonatal hearts at various time points following myocardial infarction and couple the results with bulk tissue RNA-sequencing data collected at the same time points. Concomitant single-cell ATAC sequencing exposes underlying dynamics of open chromatin landscapes and regenerative gene regulatory networks of diverse cardiac cell types and reveals extracellular mediators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, angiogenesis, and fibroblast activation. Together, our data provide a transcriptional basis for neonatal heart regeneration at single-cell resolution and suggest strategies for enhancing cardiac function after injury.

Abstract: Summary
The tuberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) protects against some heterologous infections, probably via induction of non-specific innate immune memory in monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, a process known as trained immunity. Recent studies have revealed that the induction of trained immunity is associated with a bias toward granulopoiesis in bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells, but it is unknown whether BCG vaccination also leads to functional reprogramming of mature neutrophils. Here, we show that BCG vaccination of healthy humans induces long-lasting changes in neutrophil phenotype, characterized by increased expression of activation markers and antimicrobial function. The enhanced function of human neutrophils persists for at least 3 months after vaccination and is associated with genome-wide epigenetic modifications in trimethylation at histone 3 lysine 4. Functional reprogramming of neutrophils by the induction of trained immunity might offer novel therapeutic strategies in clinical conditions that could benefit from modulation of neutrophil effector function.

Abstract: Summary
Across their dendritic trees, neurons distribute thousands of protein species that are necessary for maintaining synaptic function and plasticity and that need to be produced continuously and trafficked to their final destination. As each dendritic branchpoint splits the protein flow, increasing branchpoints decreases the total protein number downstream. Consequently, a neuron needs to produce more proteins to maintain a minimal protein number at distal synapses. Combining in vitro experiments and a theoretical framework, we show that proteins that diffuse within the cell plasma membrane are, on average, 35% more effective at reaching downstream locations than proteins that diffuse in the cytoplasm. This advantage emerges from a bias for forward motion at branchpoints when proteins diffuse within the plasma membrane. Using 3D electron microscopy (EM) data, we show that pyramidal branching statistics and the diffusion lengths of common proteins fall into a region that minimizes the overall protein need.

Abstract: Summary
Stringent targeting of membrane proteins to corresponding organelles is essential for organelle identity and functions. In addition to molecular pathways that target proteins to appropriate organelles, surveillance mechanisms clear mistargeted proteins from undesired destinations. Although Msp1 functions on the mitochondrial membrane to remove mistargeted proteins, the surveillance mechanism for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is not well understood. Here, we show that a conserved P5A-type ATPase CATP-8, which localizes to ER, removes ectopic mitochondrial tail-anchored (TA) and signal-anchored (SA) proteins from the ER. In catp-8 mutant, mitochondria fission protein FIS-1 mislocalizes to the ER membrane. Together with another mitochondria fission protein MFF-2, FIS-1 causes ER fragmentation in a Dynamin-related protein (DRP-1)-dependent manner. In addition, CATP-8 is essential for dendrite development. catp-8 mutant dramatically reduces the level of the dendrite guidance receptor DMA-1, leading to diminished dendritic arbors. Hence, P5A ATPase safeguards ER morphology and functions by preventing mitochondrial proteins mislocalization.

Abstract: Summary
Conserved protein kinases with core cellular functions have been frequently redeployed during metazoan evolution to regulate specialized developmental processes. The Ser/Arg (SR)-rich splicing factor (SRSF) protein kinase (SRPK), which is implicated in splicing regulation, is one such conserved eukaryotic kinase. Surprisingly, we show that SRPK has acquired the capacity to control a neurodevelopmental ubiquitin signaling pathway. In mammalian embryonic stem cells and cultured neurons, SRPK phosphorylates Ser-Arg motifs in RNF12/RLIM, a key developmental E3 ubiquitin ligase that is mutated in an intellectual disability syndrome. Processive phosphorylation by SRPK stimulates RNF12-dependent ubiquitylation of nuclear transcription factor substrates, thereby acting to restrain a neural gene expression program that is aberrantly expressed in intellectual disability. SRPK family genes are also mutated in intellectual disability disorders, and patient-derived SRPK point mutations impair RNF12 phosphorylation. Our data reveal unappreciated functional diversification of SRPK to regulate ubiquitin signaling that ensures correct regulation of neurodevelopmental gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial morphology shifts rapidly to manage cellular metabolism, organelle integrity, and cell fate. It remains unknown whether innate nucleic acid sensing, the central and general mechanisms of monitoring both microbial invasion and cellular damage, can reprogram and govern mitochondrial dynamics and function. Here, we unexpectedly observed that upon activation of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-MAVS signaling, TBK1 directly phosphorylated DRP1/DNM1L, which disabled DRP1, preventing its high-order oligomerization and mitochondrial fragmentation function. The TBK1-DRP1 axis was essential for assembly of large MAVS aggregates and healthy antiviral immunity and underlay nutrient-triggered mitochondrial dynamics and cell fate determination. Knockin (KI) strategies mimicking TBK1-DRP1 signaling produced dominant-negative phenotypes reminiscent of human DRP1 inborn mutations, while interrupting the TBK1-DRP1 connection compromised antiviral responses. Thus, our findings establish an unrecognized function of innate immunity governing both morphology and physiology of a major organelle, identify a lacking loop during innate RNA sensing, and report an elegant mechanism of shaping mitochondrial dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of H3K27M mutations in pediatric gliomas marked a new chapter in cancer epigenomics. Numerous studies have investigated the effect of this mutation on H3K27 trimethylation, but only recently have we started to realize its additional effects on the epigenome. Here, we use isogenic glioma H3K27M+/− cell lines to investigate H3K27 methylation and its interaction with H3K36 and H3K9 modifications. We describe a “step down” effect of H3K27M on the distribution of H3K27 methylation: me3 is reduced to me2, me2 is reduced to me1, whereas H3K36me2/3 delineates the boundaries for the spread of H3K27me marks. We also observe a replacement of H3K27me2/3 silencing by H3K9me3. Using a computational simulation, we explain our observations by reduced effectiveness of PRC2 and constraints imposed on the deposition of H3K27me by antagonistic H3K36 modifications. Our work further elucidates the effects of H3K27M in gliomas as well as the general principles of deposition in H3K27 methylation.

Abstract: Summary
The contribution and mechanism of cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis are still unclear. Here, we show that venular and capillary cerebral endothelial cells (ECs) are selectively vulnerable to necroptosis in AD. We identify reduced cerebromicrovascular expression of murine N-acetyltransferase 1 (mNat1) in two AD mouse models and hNat2, the human ortholog of mNat1 and a genetic risk factor for type-2 diabetes and insulin resistance, in human AD. mNat1 deficiency in Nat1−/− mice and two AD mouse models promotes blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and endothelial necroptosis. Decreased mNat1 expression induces lysosomal degradation of A20, an important regulator of necroptosis, and LRP1β, a key component of LRP1 complex that exports Aβ in cerebral ECs. Selective restoration of cerebral EC expression of mNAT1 delivered by adeno-associated virus (AAV) rescues cerebromicrovascular levels of A20 and LRP1β, inhibits endothelial necroptosis and activation, ameliorates mitochondrial fragmentation, reduces Aβ deposits, and improves cognitive function in the AD mouse model.

Abstract: Summary
Autoimmune T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a defect in mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP production. Here, we identified suppression of the GDP-forming β subunit of succinate-CoA ligase (SUCLG2) as an underlying abnormality. SUCLG2-deficient T cells reverted the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle from the oxidative to the reductive direction, accumulated α-ketoglutarate, citrate, and acetyl-CoA (AcCoA), and differentiated into pro-inflammatory effector cells. In AcCoAhi RA T cells, tubulin acetylation stabilized the microtubule cytoskeleton and positioned mitochondria in a perinuclear location, resulting in cellular polarization, uropod formation, T cell migration, and tissue invasion. In the tissue, SUCLG2-deficient T cells functioned as cytokine-producing effector cells and were hyperinflammatory, a defect correctable by replenishing the enzyme. Preventing T cell tubulin acetylation by tubulin acetyltransferase knockdown was sufficient to inhibit synovitis. These data link mitochondrial failure and AcCoA oversupply to autoimmune tissue inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomes have been suggested to directly control gene regulation, but regulatory roles for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) remain largely unexplored. Expansion segments (ESs) consist of multitudes of tentacle-like rRNA structures extending from the core ribosome in eukaryotes. ESs are remarkably variable in sequence and size across eukaryotic evolution with largely unknown functions. In characterizing ribosome binding to a regulatory element within a Homeobox (Hox) 5′ UTR, we identify a modular stem-loop within this element that binds to a single ES, ES9S. Engineering chimeric, “humanized” yeast ribosomes for ES9S reveals that an evolutionary change in the sequence of ES9S endows species-specific binding of Hoxa9 mRNA to the ribosome. Genome editing to site-specifically disrupt the Hoxa9-ES9S interaction demonstrates the functional importance for such selective mRNA-rRNA binding in translation control. Together, these studies unravel unexpected gene regulation directly mediated by rRNA and how ribosome evolution drives translation of critical developmental regulators.

Abstract: Summary
Sexual dimorphism in Drosophila courtship circuits requires the male-specific transcription factor fruM, which is alternatively spliced to encode the FruMA, FruMB, and FruMC isoforms. Most fruM-positive neurons express multiple variants; however, the functional significance of their co-expression remains undetermined. Do co-expressed isoforms each play unique roles to jointly regulate dimorphism? By focusing on fruM-positive olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), here, we show that FruMB and FruMC are both required for males’ age-dependent sensitization to aphrodisiac olfactory cues in a cell-autonomous manner. Interestingly, FruMB expression is upregulated with age in Or47b and Ir84a ORNs, and its overexpression mimics the effect of age in elevating olfactory responses. Mechanistically, FruMB and FruMC synergistically mediate response sensitization through cooperation of their respective downstream effectors, namely, PPK25 and PPK23, which are both required for forming a functional amplification channel in ORNs. Together, these results provide critical mechanistic insight into how co-expressed FruM isoforms jointly coordinate dimorphic neurophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
Central to anti-tumor immunity are dendritic cells (DCs), which stimulate long-lived protective T cell responses. Recent studies have demonstrated that DCs can achieve a state of hyperactivation, which is associated with inflammasome activities within living cells. Herein, we report that hyperactive DCs have an enhanced ability to migrate to draining lymph nodes and stimulate potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. This enhanced migratory activity is dependent on the chemokine receptor CCR7 and is associated with a unique transcriptional program that is not observed in conventionally activated or pyroptotic DCs. We show that hyperactivating stimuli are uniquely capable of inducing durable CTL-mediated anti-tumor immunity against tumors that are sensitive or resistant to PD-1 inhibition. These protective responses are intrinsic to the cDC1 subset of DCs, depend on the inflammasome-dependent cytokine IL-1β, and enable tumor lysates to serve as immunogens. If these activities are verified in humans, hyperactive DCs may impact immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Disturbed flow (d-flow) induces atherosclerosis by regulating gene expression in endothelial cells (ECs). For further mechanistic understanding, we carried out a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and scATAC-seq study using endothelial-enriched single cells from the left- and right carotid artery exposed to d-flow (LCA) and stable-flow (s-flow in RCA) using the mouse partial carotid ligation (PCL) model. We find eight EC clusters along with immune cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells. Analyses of marker genes, pathways, and pseudotime reveal that ECs are highly heterogeneous and plastic. D-flow induces a dramatic transition of ECs from atheroprotective phenotypes to pro-inflammatory cells, mesenchymal (EndMT) cells, hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial stem/progenitor cells, and an unexpected immune cell-like (EndICLT) phenotypes. While confirming KLF4/KLF2 as an s-flow-sensitive transcription factor binding site, we also find those sensitive to d-flow (RELA, AP1, STAT1, and TEAD1). D-flow reprograms ECs from atheroprotective to proatherogenic phenotypes, including EndMT and potentially EndICLT.

Abstract: Summary
HIV infection predisposes latent tuberculosis-infected (LTBI) subjects to active TB. This study is designed to determine whether HIV infection of LTBI subjects compromises the balanced Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific T helper 17 (Th17) response of recognized importance in anti-TB immunity. Comparative analysis of Mtb- and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CD4+ T cell responses demonstrates a marked dampening of the Mtb-specific CD4+ T cell effectors and polyfunctional cells while preserving CMV-specific response. Additionally, HIV skews the Mtb-specific Th17 response in chronic HIV-infected LTBI progressors, but not long-term non-progressors (LTNPs), with preservation of pro-inflammatory interferon (IFN)-γ+/interleukin-17+ (IL-17+) and significant loss of anti-inflammatory IL-10+/IL-17+ effectors that is restored by anti-retroviral therapy (ART). HIV-driven impairment of Mtb-specific response cannot be attributed to preferential infection as cell-associated HIV DNA and HIV RNA reveal equivalent viral burden in CD4+ T cells from different antigen specificities. We therefore propose that beyond HIV-induced loss of Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells, the associated dysregulation of Mtb-specific T cell homeostasis can potentially enhance the onset of TB in LTBI subjects.

Abstract: Summary
Gut microbiota composition is associated with human and rodent Plasmodium infections, yet the mechanism by which gut microbiota affects the severity of malaria remains unknown. Humoral immunity is critical in mediating the clearance of Plasmodium blood stage infections, prompting the hypothesis that mice with gut microbiota-dependent decreases in parasite burden exhibit better germinal center (GC) responses. In support of this hypothesis, mice with a low parasite burden exhibit increases in GC B cell numbers and parasite-specific antibody titers, as well as better maintenance of GC structures and a more targeted, qualitatively different antibody response. This enhanced humoral immunity affects memory, as mice with a low parasite burden exhibit robust protection against challenge with a heterologous, lethal Plasmodium species. These results demonstrate that gut microbiota composition influences the biology of spleen GCs as well as the titer and repertoire of parasite-specific antibodies, identifying potential approaches to develop optimal treatments for malaria.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane contact sites (MCS) are intracellular regions where two organelles come closer to exchange information and material. The majority of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) MCS are attributed to the ER-localized tether proteins VAPA, VAPB, and MOSPD2. These recruit other proteins to the ER by interacting with their FFAT motifs. Here, we describe MOSPD1 and MOSPD3 as ER-localized tethers interacting with FFAT motif-containing proteins. Using BioID, we identify proteins interacting with VAP and MOSPD proteins and find that MOSPD1 and MOSPD3 prefer unconventional FFAT-related FFNT (two phenylalanines [FF] in a neutral tract) motifs. Moreover, VAPA/VAPB/MOSPD2 and MOSPD1/MOSPD3 assemble into two separate ER-resident complexes to interact with FFAT and FFNT motifs, respectively. Because of their ability to interact with FFNT motifs, MOSPD1 and MOSPD3 could form MCS between the ER and other organelles. Collectively, these findings expand the VAP family of proteins and highlight two separate complexes in control of interactions between intracellular compartments.

Abstract: Summary
Soluble forms of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) have recently been shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We report on an improved soluble ACE2, termed a “microbody,” in which the ACE2 ectodomain is fused to Fc domain 3 of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain. The protein is smaller than previously described ACE2-Ig Fc fusion proteins and contains an H345A mutation in the ACE2 catalytic active site that inactivates the enzyme without reducing its affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike. The disulfide-bonded ACE2 microbody protein inhibits entry of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped virus and replication of live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in a mouse model. Its potency is 10-fold higher than soluble ACE2, and it can act after virus bound to the cell. The microbody inhibits the entry of β coronaviruses and virus with the variant D614G spike. The ACE2 microbody may be a valuable therapeutic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is active against viral variants and future coronaviruses.

Abstract: Summary
CELF6 is a CELF-RNA-binding protein, and thus part of a protein family with roles in human disease; however, its mRNA targets in the brain are largely unknown. Using cross-linking immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CLIP-seq), we define its CNS targets, which are enriched for 3′ UTRs in synaptic protein-coding genes. Using a massively parallel reporter assay framework, we test the consequence of CELF6 expression on target sequences, with and without mutating putative binding motifs. Where CELF6 exerts an effect on sequences, it is largely to decrease RNA abundance, which is reversed by mutating UGU-rich motifs. This is also the case for CELF3–5, with a protein-dependent effect on magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that targets are derepressed in CELF6-mutant mice, and at least two key CNS proteins, FOS and FGF13, show altered protein expression levels and localization. Our works find, in addition to previously identified roles in splicing, that CELF6 is associated with repression of its CNS targets via the 3′ UTR in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired DNA crosslink repair leads to Fanconi anemia (FA), characterized by a unique manifestation of bone marrow failure and pancytopenia among diseases caused by DNA damage response defects. As a germline disorder, why the hematopoietic hierarchy is specifically affected is not fully understood. We find that reprogramming transcription during hematopoietic differentiation results in an overload of genotoxic stress, which causes aborted differentiation and depletion of FA mutant progenitor cells. DNA damage onset most likely arises from formaldehyde, an obligate by-product of oxidative protein demethylation during transcription regulation. Our results demonstrate that rapid and extensive transcription reprogramming associated with hematopoietic differentiation poses a major threat to genome stability and cell viability in the absence of the FA pathway. The connection between differentiation and DNA damage accumulation reveals a novel mechanism of genome scarring and is critical to exploring therapies to counteract the aplastic anemia for the treatment of FA patients.

Abstract: Summary
Angiogenesis and neurogenesis are tightly coupled during embryonic brain development. However, little is known about how these two processes interact. We show that nascent blood vessels actively contact dividing neural stem cells by endothelial filopodia in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the murine ventral telencephalon; this association is conserved in the human ventral VZ. Using mouse mutants with altered vascular filopodia density, we show that this interaction leads to prolonged cell cycle of apical neural progenitors (ANPs) and favors early neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, pharmacological experiments reveal that ANPs induce vascular filopodia formation by upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. This mutual relationship between vascular filopodia and ANPs works as a self-regulatory system that senses ANP proliferation rates and rapidly adjusts neuronal production levels. Our findings indicate a function of vascular filopodia in fine-tuning neural stem cell behavior, which is the basis for proper brain development.

Abstract: Summary
Concurrent infection with multiple pathogens occurs frequently in individuals and can result in exacerbated infections and altered immunity. However, the impact of such coinfections on immune responses remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that systemic infection results in an inflammation-induced suppression of local immunity. During localized infection or vaccination in barrier tissues including the skin or respiratory tract, concurrent systemic infection induces a type I interferon-dependent lymphopenia that impairs lymphocyte recruitment to the draining lymph node (dLN) and induces sequestration of lymphocytes in non-draining LN. This contributes to suppressed fibroblastic reticular cell and endothelial cell expansion and dLN remodeling and impairs induction of B cell responses and antibody production. Our data suggest that contemporaneous systemic inflammation constrains the induction of regional immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the formation and propagation of protein aggregates, especially amyloid fibrils. However, what normally suppresses protein misfolding and aggregation in metazoan cells remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that TRIM11, a member of the metazoan tripartite motif (TRIM) family, both prevents the formation of protein aggregates and dissolves pre-existing protein deposits, including amyloid fibrils. These molecular chaperone and disaggregase activities are ATP independent. They enhance folding and solubility of normal proteins and cooperate with TRIM11 SUMO ligase activity to degrade aberrant proteins. TRIM11 abrogates α-synuclein fibrillization and restores viability in cell models of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Intracranial adeno-associated viral delivery of TRIM11 mitigates α-synuclein-mediated pathology, neurodegeneration, and motor impairments in a PD mouse model. Other TRIMs can also function as ATP-independent molecular chaperones and disaggregases. Thus, we define TRIMs as a potent and multifunctional protein quality-control system in metazoa, which might be applied to treat neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
People tend to fall asleep when gently rocked or vibrated. Experimental studies have shown that rocking promotes sleep in humans and mice. However, the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon are not well understood. A habituation model proposes that habituation, a form of non-associative learning, mediates sleep induction by monotonous stimulation. Here, we show that gentle vibration promotes sleep in Drosophila in part through habituation. Vibration-induced sleep (VIS) leads to increased homeostatic sleep credit and reduced arousability, and can be suppressed by heightened arousal or reduced GABA signaling. Multiple mechanosensory organs mediate VIS, and the magnitude of VIS depends on vibration frequency and genetic background. Sleep induction improves over successive blocks of vibration. Furthermore, training with continuous vibration does not generalize to intermittent vibration, demonstrating stimulus specificity, a characteristic of habituation. Our findings suggest that habituation plays a significant role in sleep induction by vibration.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we report that functional heterogeneity of macrophages in cancer could be determined by the nature of their precursors: monocytes (Mons) and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs). Macrophages that are differentiated from M-MDSCs, but not from Mons, are immune suppressive, with a genomic profile matching that of M-MDSCs. Immune-suppressive activity of M-MDSC-derived macrophages is dependent on the persistent expression of S100A9 protein in these cells. S100A9 also promotes M2 polarization of macrophages. Tissue-resident- and Mon-derived macrophages lack expression of this protein. S100A9-dependent immune-suppressive activity of macrophages involves transcription factor C/EBPβ. The presence of S100A9-positive macrophages in tumor tissues is associated with shorter survival in patients with head and neck cancer and poor response to PD-1 antibody treatment in patients with metastatic melanoma. Thus, this study reveals the pathway of the development of immune-suppressive macrophages and suggests an approach to their selective targeting.

Abstract: Summary
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) compartmentalizes transcriptional condensates for gene expression, but little is known about how this process is controlled. Here, we showed that depletion of IPMK, encoding inositol polyphosphate multikinase, promotes autophagy and lysosomal function and biogenesis in a TFEB-dependent manner. Cytoplasmic-nuclear trafficking of TFEB, a well-characterized mechanism by which diverse signaling pathways regulate TFEB activity, is not evidently altered by IPMK depletion. We demonstrated that nuclear TFEB forms distinct puncta that colocalize with the Mediator complex and with mRNAs of target lysosomal genes. TFEB undergoes LLPS in vitro. IPMK directly interacts with and inhibits LLPS of TFEB and also dissolves TFEB condensates. Depletion of IPMK increases the number of nuclear TFEB puncta and the co-localization of TFEB with Mediator and mRNAs of target genes. Our study reveals that nuclear-localized IPMK acts as a chaperone to inhibit LLPS of TFEB to negatively control its transcriptional activity.

Abstract: Summary
Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic assemblies of proteins and non-translating mRNAs. Whereas much has been learned about SG formation, a major gap remains in understanding the compositional changes SGs undergo during normal disassembly and under disease conditions. Here, we address this gap by proteomic dissection of the SG temporal disassembly sequence using multi-bait APEX proximity proteomics. We discover 109 novel SG proteins and characterize distinct SG substructures. We reveal dozens of disassembly-engaged proteins (DEPs), some of which play functional roles in SG disassembly, including small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugating enzymes. We further demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates SG disassembly and SG formation. Parallel proteomics with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated C9ORF72 dipeptides uncovered attenuated DEP recruitment during SG disassembly and impaired SUMOylation. Accordingly, SUMO activity ameliorated C9ORF72-ALS-related neurodegeneration in Drosophila. By dissecting the SG spatiotemporal proteomic landscape, we provide an in-depth resource for future work on SG function and reveal basic and disease-relevant mechanisms of SG disassembly.

Abstract: Spermatozoan ultrastructure and complete mitochondrial genome in the marine bivalve mollusk Meretrix sp. (Taiwan) from Taiwan are described and contrasted with other bivalves, especially within Meretrix. We have examined the features of the mature gonadal spermatozoa of Meretrix sp. (Taiwan) and provided comparisons with the other four Meretrix species (M. petechialis, M. meretrix, M. lyrata, and M. lamarckii). The morphological characteristics of these spermatozoa are diagnostic for each of the species studied here. The most marked interspecific difference was found in the acrosome. Meretrix sp. (Taiwan) is genetically distinct and is a different species from M. petechialis and M. lusoria (Japan) based on complete mitochondrial genome data. Sperm data for Meretrix are limited but show remarkable congruence with the molecular results. We suggest use Meretrix formosa Gwo and Hsu as the scientific name for Taiwanese hard clams, Meretrix sp. (Taiwan). Additional species, particularly the Japanese hard clam (M. lusoria) require examination before this tentative conclusion can be verified.

Abstract: Summary
Transposable elements (TEs) drive genome evolution and are a notable source of pathogenesis, including cancer. While CpG methylation regulates TE activity, the locus-specific methylation landscape of mobile human TEs has to date proven largely inaccessible. Here, we apply new computational tools and long-read nanopore sequencing to directly infer CpG methylation of novel and extant TE insertions in hippocampus, heart, and liver, as well as paired tumor and non-tumor liver. As opposed to an indiscriminate stochastic process, we find pronounced demethylation of young long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons in cancer, often distinct to the adjacent genome and other TEs. SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposons, including their internal tandem repeat-associated CpG island, are near-universally methylated. We encounter allele-specific TE methylation and demethylation of aberrantly expressed young LINE-1s in normal tissues. Finally, we recover the complete sequences of tumor-specific LINE-1 insertions and their retrotransposition hallmarks, demonstrating how long-read sequencing can simultaneously survey the epigenome and detect somatic TE mobilization.

Abstract: Summary
Isogenic cells manifest distinct cellular fates for a single stress; however, the nongenetic mechanisms driving such fates remain poorly understood. Here, we implement a robust multi-channel live-cell imaging approach to uncover noncanonical factors governing cell fate. We show that in response to acute glucose removal (AGR), budding yeast undergoes distinct fates, becoming either quiescent or senescent. Senescent cells fail to resume mitotic cycles following glucose replenishment but remain responsive to nutrient stimuli. Whereas quiescent cells manifest starvation-induced adaptation, senescent cells display perturbed endomembrane trafficking and defective nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ) expansion. Surprisingly, senescence occurs even in the absence of lipid droplets. Importantly, we identify the nutrient-sensing kinase Rim15 as a key biomarker predicting cell fates before AGR stress. We propose that isogenic yeast challenged with acute nutrient shortage contains determinants influencing post-stress fate and demonstrate that specific nutrient signaling, stress response, trafficking, and inter-organelle biomarkers are early indicators for long-term fate outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the well-established role of actin polymerization as a driving mechanism for cell protrusion, upregulated actin polymerization alone does not initiate protrusions. Using a combination of theoretical modeling and quantitative live-cell imaging experiments, we show that local depletion of actin-membrane links is needed for protrusion initiation. Specifically, we show that the actin-membrane linker ezrin is depleted prior to protrusion onset and that perturbation of ezrin’s affinity for actin modulates protrusion frequency and efficiency. We also show how actin-membrane release works in concert with actin polymerization, leading to a comprehensive model for actin-driven shape changes. Actin-membrane release plays a similar role in protrusions driven by intracellular pressure. Thus, our findings suggest that protrusion initiation might be governed by a universal regulatory mechanism, whereas the mechanism of force generation determines the shape and expansion properties of the protrusion.

Abstract: Summary
Global tissue tension anisotropy has been shown to trigger stereotypical cell division orientation by elongating mitotic cells along the main tension axis. Yet, how tissue tension elongates mitotic cells despite those cells undergoing mitotic rounding (MR) by globally upregulating cortical actomyosin tension remains unclear. We addressed this question by taking advantage of ascidian embryos, consisting of a small number of interphasic and mitotic blastomeres and displaying an invariant division pattern. We found that blastomeres undergo MR by locally relaxing cortical tension at their apex, thereby allowing extrinsic pulling forces from neighboring interphasic blastomeres to polarize their shape and thus division orientation. Consistently, interfering with extrinsic forces by reducing the contractility of interphasic blastomeres or disrupting the establishment of asynchronous mitotic domains leads to aberrant mitotic cell division orientations. Thus, apical relaxation during MR constitutes a key mechanism by which tissue tension anisotropy controls stereotypical cell division orientation.

Abstract: Summary
Retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), a nuclear receptor of transcription factor, controls various physiological and pathological pathways including cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Here, we report that RXRα is phosphorylated at its N-terminal A/B domain by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) at the onset of mitosis, triggering its translocation to the centrosome, where phosphorylated-RXRα (p-RXRα) interacts with polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) through its N-terminal A/B domain by a unique mechanism. The interaction promotes PLK1 activation, centrosome maturation, and mitotic progression. Levels of p-RXRα are abnormally elevated in cancer cell lines, during carcinogenesis in animals, and in clinical tumor tissues. An RXRα ligand XS060, which specifically inhibits p-RXRα/PLK1 interaction but not RXRα heterodimerization, promotes mitotic arrest and catastrophe in a tumor-specific manner. These findings unravel a transcription-independent action of RXRα at the centrosome during mitosis and identify p-RXRα as a tumor-specific vulnerability for developing mitotic drugs with improved therapeutic index.

Abstract: Summary
Three types of structurally related structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes, referred to as condensins, have been identified in bacteria. Smc-ScpAB is present in most bacteria, whereas MukBEF is found in enterobacteria and MksBEF is scattered over the phylogenic tree. The contributions of these condensins to chromosome management were characterized in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which carries both Smc-ScpAB and MksBEF. In this bacterium, SMC-ScpAB controls chromosome disposition by juxtaposing chromosome arms. In contrast, MksBEF is critical for chromosome segregation in the absence of the main segregation system, and it affects the higher-order architecture of the chromosome by promoting DNA contacts in the megabase range. Strikingly, our results reveal a prevalence of Smc-ScpAB over MksBEF involving a coordination of their activities with chromosome replication. They also show that E. coli MukBEF can substitute for MksBEF in P. aeruginosa while prevailing over Smc-ScpAB. Our results reveal a hierarchy between activities of bacterial condensins on the same chromosome.

Abstract: Summary
In multicellular organisms, neurons integrate a diverse array of external cues to affect downstream changes in organismal health. Specifically, activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPRER) in neurons increases lifespan by preventing age-onset loss of ER proteostasis and driving lipid depletion in a cell non-autonomous manner. The mechanism of this communication is dependent on the release of small clear vesicles from neurons. We find dopaminergic neurons are necessary and sufficient for activation of cell non-autonomous UPRER to drive lipid depletion in peripheral tissues, whereas serotonergic neurons are sufficient to drive protein homeostasis in peripheral tissues. These signaling modalities are unique and independent and together coordinate the beneficial effects of neuronal cell non-autonomous ER stress signaling upon health and longevity.

Abstract: Summary
Development of blood-forming (hemogenic) endothelial cells that give rise to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is critical during embryogenesis to generate the embryonic and postnatal hematopoietic system. We previously demonstrated that the specification of murine hemogenic endothelial cells is promoted by retinoic acid (RA) signaling and requires downstream endothelial cell cycle control. Whether this mechanism is conserved in human hemogenic endothelial cell specification is unknown. Here, we present a protocol to derive primordial endothelial cells from human embryonic stem cells and promote their specification toward hemogenic endothelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RA treatment significantly increases human hemogenic endothelial cell specification. That is, RA promotes endothelial cell cycle arrest to enable RA-induced instructive signals to upregulate the genes needed for hematopoietic transition. These insights provide guidance for the ex vivo generation of autologous human hemogenic endothelial cells that are needed to produce human HSPCs for regenerative medicine applications.

Abstract: Summary
Anterolateral system neurons relay pain, itch, and temperature information from the spinal cord to pain-related brain regions, but the differentiation of these neurons and their specific contribution to pain perception remain poorly defined. Here, we show that most mouse spinal neurons that embryonically express the autonomic-system-associated Paired-like homeobox 2A (Phox2a) transcription factor innervate nociceptive brain targets, including the parabrachial nucleus and the thalamus. We define the Phox2a anterolateral system neuron birth order, migration, and differentiation and uncover an essential role for Phox2a in the development of relay of nociceptive signals from the spinal cord to the brain. Finally, we also demonstrate that the molecular identity of Phox2a neurons is conserved in the human fetal spinal cord, arguing that the developmental expression of Phox2a is a prominent feature of anterolateral system neurons.

Abstract: Summary
In gene silencing, Hsp90 chaperone machinery assists Argonaute (Ago) binding and unwinding of silencing small RNA (sRNA) duplexes. This enables the formation of effector RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that often displays cargo preferences. Hence, in Drosophila, microRNAs (miRNAs) and small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are differentially sorted into Ago1-RISC and Ago2-RISC, respectively. Here, we identify fly Cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40) as a testis-specialized Hsp90 co-chaperone essential for spermatogenesis and for modulating Ago2-RISC formation. We show that testis-distinctive Ago-sorting and strand-selection mechanisms accumulate a unique set of miRNAs on Ago2. Cyp40 interacts with duplex-incorporating Ago2 through Hsp90 in vitro and selectively promotes the build-up of Ago2-bound miRNAs, but not endogenous siRNAs, in vivo. Moreover, one of Cyp40-dependent Ago2-sorted miRNAs is required for late spermatogenesis, unraveling the physiological relevance of the unconventional yet conserved Drosophila miRNA-Ago2 sorting pathway. Collectively, these results identify RISC-regulatory roles for Hsp90 machinery and, more generally, highlight the tissue-specific adaptation of sRNA pathways through chaperone diversification.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is known to regulate mRNA decay, yet how this modification promotes maternal transcript degradation remains unclear. Here, we find that m6A promotes maternal mRNA deadenylation. Yet, genetic loss of m6A readers Ythdf2 and Ythdf3 did not impact global maternal mRNA clearance, zygotic genome activation, or the onset of gastrulation, challenging the view that Ythdf2 alone is critical to developmental timing. We reveal that Ythdf proteins function redundantly during zebrafish oogenesis and development, as double Ythdf2 and Ythdf3 deletion prevented female gonad formation and triple Ythdf mutants were lethal. Finally, we show that the microRNA miR-430 functions additively with methylation to promote degradation of common transcript targets. Together these findings reveal that m6A facilitates maternal mRNA deadenylation and that multiple pathways and readers act in concert to mediate these effects of methylation on RNA stability.

Abstract: Summary
Regulator of telomere length 1 (RTEL1) is an essential helicase that maintains telomere integrity and facilitates DNA replication. The source of replication stress in Rtel1-deficient cells remains unclear. Here, we report that loss of RTEL1 confers extensive transcriptional changes independent of its roles at telomeres. The majority of affected genes in Rtel1−/− cells possess G-quadruplex (G4)-DNA-forming sequences in their promoters and are similarly altered at a transcriptional level in wild-type cells treated with the G4-DNA stabilizer TMPyP4 (5,10,15,20-Tetrakis-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphine). Failure to resolve G4-DNAs formed in the displaced strand of RNA-DNA hybrids in Rtel1−/− cells is suggested by increased R-loops and elevated transcription-replication collisions (TRCs). Moreover, removal of R-loops by RNaseH1 overexpression suppresses TRCs and alleviates the global replication defects observed in Rtel1−/− and Rtel1PIP_box knockin cells and in wild-type cells treated with TMPyP4. We propose that RTEL1 unwinds G4-DNA/R-loops to avert TRCs, which is important to prevent global deregulation in both transcription and DNA replication.

Abstract: Summary
E2F transcription factors control the expression of cell-cycle genes. Cancers often demonstrate enhanced E2F target gene expression, which can be explained by increased percentages of replicating cells. However, we demonstrate in human cancer biopsy specimens that individual neoplastic cells display abnormally high levels of E2F-dependent transcription. To mimic this situation, we delete the atypical E2F repressors (E2F7/8) or overexpress the E2F3 activator in untransformed cells. Cells with elevated E2F activity during S/G2 phase fail to exit the cell cycle after DNA damage and undergo mitosis. In contrast, wild-type cells complete S phase and then exit the cell cycle by activating the APC/CCdh1 via repression of the E2F target Emi1. Many arrested wild-type cells eventually inactivate APC/CCdh1 to execute a second round of DNA replication and mitosis, thereby becoming tetraploid. Cells with elevated E2F transcription fail to exit the cell cycle after DNA damage, which potentially causes genomic instability, promotes malignant progression, and reduces drug sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
How cells with metastatic potential, or pro-metastatic states, arise within heterogeneous primary tumors remains unclear. Here, we have used one index primary colon cancer to develop spiked-scRNAseq to link omics-defined single-cell clusters with cell behavior. Using spiked-scRNAseq we uncover cell populations with differential metastatic potential in which pro-metastatic states are correlated with the expression of signaling and vesicle-trafficking genes. Analyzing such heterogeneity, we define an anti-metastatic, non-cell-autonomous interaction originating from non-/low-metastatic cells, and identify membrane VSIG1 as a critical mediator of this interaction. VSIG1 acts to restrict the development of pro-metastatic states autonomously and non-cell autonomously, in part by inhibiting YAP/TAZ-TEAD signaling. As VSIG1 re-expression is able to reduce metastatic behavior from multiple colon cancer cell types, the regulation of VSIG1 or its effectors opens new interventional opportunities. In general, we propose that crosstalk between cancer cells, including the action of VSIG1, dynamically defines the degree of pro-metastatic intra-tumoral heterogeneity.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T helper (Th) cell differentiation is controlled by lineage-specific expression of transcription factors and effector proteins, as well as silencing of lineage-promiscuous genes. Lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) comprise a major class of epigenetic enzymes that are emerging as important regulators of Th cell biology. Here, we show that the KMT DOT1L regulates Th cell function and lineage integrity. DOT1L-dependent dimethylation of lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79me2) is associated with lineage-specific gene expression. However, DOT1L-deficient Th cells overproduce IFN-γ under lineage-specific and lineage-promiscuous conditions. Consistent with the increased IFN-γ response, mice with a T-cell-specific deletion of DOT1L are susceptible to infection with the helminth parasite Trichuris muris and are resistant to the development of allergic lung inflammation. These results identify a central role for DOT1L in Th2 cell lineage commitment and stability and suggest that inhibition of DOT1L may provide a therapeutic strategy to limit type 2 immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical signals transmitted through the cytoplasmic actin cytoskeleton must be relayed to the nucleus to control gene expression. LIM domains are protein-protein interaction modules found in cytoskeletal proteins and transcriptional regulators. Here, we identify three LIM protein families (zyxin, paxillin, and FHL) whose members preferentially localize to the actin cytoskeleton in mechanically stimulated cells through their tandem LIM domains. A minimal actin-myosin reconstitution system reveals that representatives of all three families directly bind F-actin only in the presence of mechanical force. Point mutations at a site conserved in each LIM domain of these proteins disrupt tensed F-actin binding in vitro and cytoskeletal localization in cells, demonstrating a common, avidity-based mechanism. Finally, we find that binding to tensed F-actin in the cytoplasm excludes the cancer-associated transcriptional co-activator FHL2 from the nucleus in stiff microenvironments. This establishes direct force-activated F-actin binding as a mechanosensing mechanism by which cytoskeletal tension can govern nuclear localization.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiation therapy utilizes our understanding of the hierarchy of cellular systems to pharmacologically induce a shift toward terminal commitment. While this approach has been a paradigm in treating certain hematological malignancies, efforts to translate this success to solid tumors have met with limited success. Mammary-specific activation of PKA in mouse models leads to aberrant differentiation and diminished self-renewing potential of the basal compartment, which harbors mammary repopulating cells. PKA activation results in tumors that are more benign, exhibiting reduced metastatic propensity, loss of tumor-initiating potential, and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. Analysis of tumor histopathology revealed features of overt differentiation with papillary characteristics. Longitudinal single-cell profiling at the hyperplasia and tumor stages uncovered an altered path of tumor evolution whereby PKA curtails the emergence of aggressive subpopulations. Acting through the repression of SOX4, PKA activation promotes tumor differentiation and represents a possible adjuvant to chemotherapy for certain breast cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Multi-input logic gene circuits can enable sophisticated control of cell function, yet large-scale synthetic circuitry in mammalian cells has relied on post-transcriptional regulation or recombinase-triggered state transitions. Large-scale transcriptional logic, on the other hand, has been challenging to implement. Inspired by a naturally found regulatory strategy of using multiple alternative promoters, followed by alternative splicing, we developed a scalable and compact platform for transcriptional OR logic using inputs to those promoters. The platform is extended to implement disjunctive normal form (DNF) computations capable of implementing arbitrary logic rules. Specifically, AND logic is implemented at individual promoters using synergistic transcriptional inputs, and NOT logic via microRNA inputs targeting unique exon sequences driven by those promoters. Together, these regulatory programs result in DNF-like logic control of output gene expression. The approach offers flexibility for building complex logic programs in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
Bioenergetic reprogramming during hypoxia adaption is critical to promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth and progression. However, the mechanism underlying the orchestration of mitochondrial OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation) and glycolysis in hypoxia is not fully understood. Here, we report that mitochondrial UQCC3 (C11orf83) expression increases in hypoxia and correlates with the poor prognosis of HCC patients. Loss of UQCC3 impairs HCC cell proliferation in hypoxia in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, UQCC3 forms a positive feedback loop with mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) to sustain UQCC3 expression and ROS generation in hypoxic HCC cells and subsequently maintains mitochondrial structure and function and stabilizes HIF-1α expression to enhance glycolysis under hypoxia. Thus, UQCC3 plays an indispensable role for bioenergetic reprogramming of HCC cells during hypoxia adaption by simultaneously regulating OXPHOS and glycolysis. The positive feedback between UQCC3 and ROS indicates a self-modulating model within mitochondria that initiates the adaptation of HCC to hypoxic stress.

Abstract: Summary
Embryogenesis is directed by morphogens that induce differentiation within a defined tissue geometry. Tissue organization is mediated by cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions and is modulated by cell tension and tissue-level forces. Whether cell tension regulates development by modifying morphogen signaling is less clear. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) exhibit an intrinsic capacity for self-organization, which motivates their use as a tractable model of early human embryogenesis. We engineered patterned substrates that recapitulate the biophysical properties of the early embryo and mediate the self-organization of “gastrulation-like” nodes in cultured hESCs. Tissue geometries that generated local nodes of high cell-adhesion tension directed the spatial patterning of the BMP4-dependent “gastrulation-like” phenotype by enhancing phosphorylation and junctional release of β-catenin to promote Wnt signaling and mesoderm specification. Furthermore, direct force application via mechanical stretching promoted BMP-dependent mesoderm specification, confirming that tissue-level forces can directly regulate cell fate specification in early human development.

Abstract: Summary
We have identified and validated a spaceflight-associated microRNA (miRNA) signature that is shared by rodents and humans in response to simulated, short-duration and long-duration spaceflight. Previous studies have identified miRNAs that regulate rodent responses to spaceflight in low-Earth orbit, and we have confirmed the expression of these proposed spaceflight-associated miRNAs in rodents reacting to simulated spaceflight conditions. Moreover, astronaut samples from the NASA Twins Study confirmed these expression signatures in miRNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) data. Additionally, a subset of these miRNAs (miR-125, miR-16, and let-7a) was found to regulate vascular damage caused by simulated deep space radiation. To demonstrate the physiological relevance of key spaceflight-associated miRNAs, we utilized antagomirs to inhibit their expression and successfully rescue simulated deep-space-radiation-mediated damage in human 3D vascular constructs.

Abstract: Summary
We systematically compare the contributions of two dopaminergic and two cholinergic ascending populations to a spatial short-term memory task in rats. In ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTA-DA) and nucleus basalis cholinergic (NB-ChAT) populations, trial-by-trial fluctuations in activity during the delay period relate to performance with an inverted-U, despite the fact that both populations have low activity during that time. Transient manipulations reveal that only VTA-DA neurons, and not the other three populations we examine, contribute causally and selectively to short-term memory. This contribution is most significant during the delay period, when both increases and decreases in VTA-DA activity impair short-term memory. Our results reveal a surprising dissociation between when VTA-DA neurons are most active and when they have the biggest causal contribution to short-term memory, and they also provide support for classic ideas about an inverted-U relationship between neuromodulation and cognition.

Abstract: Cell type specification is a delicate biological event in which every step is under tight regulation. From a molecular point of view, cell fate commitment begins with chromatin alteration, which kickstarts lineage-determining factors to initiate a series of genes required for cell specification. Several important neuronal differentiation factors have been identified from ectopic over-expression studies. However, there is scarce information on which DNA regions are modified during induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) to neuronal progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation, the cis regulatory factors that attach to these accessible regions, or the genes that are initially expressed. In this study, we identified the DNA accessible regions of iPSCs and NPCs via the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq). We identified which chromatin regions were modified after neuronal differentiation and found that the enhancer regions had more active histone modification changes than the promoters. Through motif enrichment analysis, we found that NEUROD1 controls iPSC differentiation to NPC by binding to the accessible regions of enhancers in cooperation with other factors such as the Hox proteins. Finally, by using Hi-C data, we categorized the genes that directly interacted with the enhancers under the control of NEUROD1 during iPSC to NPC differentiation.

Abstract: Cilia are important eukaryotic cellular compartments required for diverse biological functions. Recent studies have revealed that protein targeting into the proper ciliary subcompartments is essential for ciliary function. In Drosophila chordotonal cilium, where mechano-electric transduction occurs, two transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily ion channels, TRPV and TRPN, are restricted to the proximal and distal subcompartments, respectively. To understand the mechanisms underlying the sub-ciliary segregation of the two TRPs, we analyzed their localization under various conditions. In developing chordotonal cilia, TRPN was directly targeted to the ciliary tip from the beginning of its appearance and was retained in the distal subcompartment throughout development, whereas the ciliary localization of TRPV was considerably delayed. Lack of intraflagella transport-related proteins affected TRPV from the initial stage of its pre-ciliary trafficking, whereas it affected TRPN from the ciliary entry stage. The ectopic expression of the two TRP channels in both ciliated and non-ciliated cells revealed their intrinsic properties related to their localization. Taken together, our results suggest that sub-ciliary segregation of the two TRP channels relies on their distinct intrinsic properties, and begins at the initial stage of their pre-ciliary trafficking.

Abstract: Summary
Human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) derived from blastocysts and first-trimester cytotrophoblasts offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the placenta. However, access to human embryos and first-trimester placentas is limited, thus preventing the establishment of hTSCs from diverse genetic backgrounds associated with placental disorders. Here, we show that hTSCs can be generated from numerous genetic backgrounds using post-natal cells via two alternative methods: (1) somatic cell reprogramming of adult fibroblasts with OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC (OSKM) and (2) cell fate conversion of naive and extended pluripotent stem cells. The resulting induced/converted hTSCs recapitulated hallmarks of hTSCs including long-term self-renewal, expression of specific transcription factors, transcriptomic signature, and the potential to differentiate into syncytiotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast cells. We also clarified the developmental stage of hTSCs and show that these cells resemble day 8 cytotrophoblasts. Altogether, hTSC lines of diverse genetic origins open the possibility to model both placental development and diseases in a dish.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA modification and is installed by the METTL3-METTL14-WTAP methyltransferase complex. Although the importance of m6A methylation in mRNA metabolism has been well documented recently, regulation of the m6A machinery remains obscure. Through a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identify the ERK pathway and USP5 as positive regulators of the m6A deposition. We find that ERK phosphorylates METTL3 at S43/S50/S525 and WTAP at S306/S341, followed by deubiquitination by USP5, resulting in stabilization of the m6A methyltransferase complex. Lack of METTL3/WTAP phosphorylation reduces decay of m6A-labeled pluripotent factor transcripts and traps mouse embryonic stem cells in the pluripotent state. The same phosphorylation can also be found in ERK-activated human cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Our study reveals an unrecognized function of ERK in regulating m6A methylation.
