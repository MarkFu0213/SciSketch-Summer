Abstract: The effects of doping level, illumination intensity and temperature on the regeneration kinetics and dynamics of BO defects in compensated n-Si have been investigated. The regeneration rate, corrected with interstitial oxygen concentration and average injection level, is almost constant in n-type samples with different doping levels under the same regeneration condition. It is proportional to the average injection level during regeneration when the doping level and temperature are fixed. In comparison with previous studies using n-type silicon, the regeneration completeness is significantly improved, especially in samples with net doping levels higher than 1 × 1016 cm−3, due to the higher regeneration temperature and more stable surface passivation films. The remaining incompleteness is mostly dominated by the occupation of the annealed state (as opposed to the activated state). For rapid and complete regeneration, the optimal condition is applying high illumination intensities at around 200°C.

[1], on the subject of performance of a photovoltaic thermal solar air collector. The suspected errors begin at the equations for calculating the temperature of the air and the temperature of the outlet air. These errors may have a significant effect on the collector efficiency. The corrected equations are suggested.

Abstract: Corrosion mechanisms for current heat transfer fluid and storage media used in CSP plants working at temperatures from 300 °C to 600 °C are reviewed in this paper. The studies found in the literature show that these mechanisms are influenced by the impurities present in the salt and the relation between Mg(NO3)2, moisture, CO2, perchlorates, and sulphates with the corrosion process. Corrosion mechanisms were identified along with a discussion of the corrosion products and their influence on the corrosion layers formed.

Abstract: High bleaching/coloring electrochemical reversibility is crucial for practical applications of an electrochromic material. In this study, ferrocyanide-containing poly(butyl viologen) (PBV:fc) thin films were prepared by electropolymerization, and subsequently investigated and compared their redox properties by using the electrolyte with and without the addition of potassium ferrocyanide (K4Fe(CN)6). Electrochemical and electrochromic properties of the PBV:fc thin films were studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and UV–Vis spectroscopy techniques. The mass changes of the PBV:fc thin films during their redox reactions were studied by using electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) technique. In addition, the scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) studies confirmed the stable anion insertion/extraction of Fe(CN)64− within a PBV:fc thin film. The obtained results indicate that the redox reversibility of the PBV:fc thin film can be effectively improved by the addition of K4Fe(CN)6 in the electrolyte. It is deduced that the enhancement of bleaching/coloring stability of the PBV:fc thin film is affected by Fe(CN)64− charge balance during the reactions. Complementary electrochromic devices (ECDs) using the PBV:fc and Prussian blue (PB) thin films were fabricated. Finally, the ECD with the electrolyte containing K4Fe(CN)6 shows the superior transmittance modulation stability than the one without K4Fe(CN)6.

Abstract: In this study we make a detailed comparison between indium tin oxide (ITO), aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) and hydrogenated indium oxide (IO:H) when applied on the illuminated side of rear-junction silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. ITO being the state of the art material for this application, ZnO:Al being an attractive substitute due to its cost effectiveness and IO:H being a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) with high-mobility and excellent optical properties. Through numerical simulations, the optically optimal thicknesses for a double layer anti-reflective coating system, consisting of the respective TCO and amorphous silicon oxide (a-SiO2) capping layers are defined. Through two-dimensional electrical simulations, we present a comparison between front-junction and rear-junction devices to show the behavior of series resistance (Rs) in dependence of the TCO sheet resistance (Rsh) and the device effective lifetime (τeff). The study indicates that there is a τeff dependent critical TCO Rsh value, above which, the rear-junction device will become advantageous over the front-junction design in terms of Rs. Solar cells with the respective layers are analyzed. We show that a thinner TCO optimized layer will result in a benefit in cell performance when implementing a double layer anti-reflective coating. We conclude that for a highest efficiency solar cell performance, a high mobility TCO, like IO:H, is required as the device simulations show. However, the rear-junction solar cell design permits the implementation of a lower conductive TCO in the example of the cost-effective ZnO:Al with comparable performance to the ITO, opening the possibility for substitution in mass production.

Abstract: Ultrathin silicon oxide (SiOx) is used as a passivating and tunneling layer in high efficiency passivated contact silicon (Si) wafer solar cells. In this work, the emitter surface passivation quality using a low-cost, low-temperature (40 °C), non-acidic and safe chemical oxide passivation process (named as NCPRE-oxide) grown using sodium hypochlorite solution is compared with other existing oxide growth or deposition processes such as dry thermal oxide, Radio Corporation of America standard clean-2 (RCA-2) chemical oxide, nitric acid based oxide, sulphuric acid based (Piranha) oxide, ozone based oxide and deposited oxide by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition on standard 6-inch textured Si wafers. All the oxides layers are capped with hydrogenated amorphous silicon nitride (SiNy:H) improve passivation of the n+-type Si surface. There is a substantial improvement in the effective minority carrier lifetime (τeff) for SiOx/SiNy:H stack on the phosphorous diffused pyramidal textured Si surface. Further, to compare the influence of NCPRE-oxide process with other oxide processes on the electrical performance of the final device, these different processes were included in the fabrication of large area industrial aluminum-back surface field (Al-BSF) solar cells. A comprehensive analysis based on ellipsometry for film thickness measurement, τeff measurement, cell current-voltage characteristics, photoluminescence imaging, internal quantum efficiency mapping, and front surface recombination velocity measurement is presented. The NCPRE-oxide process resulted in a similar improvement in passivation and cell efficiency as other oxide processes for Al-BSF cells. In addition, its low-cost, low thermal budget, easy waste disposal, and single-component nature make it viable for industrial scale implementation.

Abstract: Windows play a huge role in today's buildings, allowing for outside view and providing occupants with daylight. However, windows are also often considered to be one of the weakest building components with respect to high thermal losses and are in addition often the reason for overheating and glare issues. In comparison to traditional static windows, dynamic solutions like adaptive and controllable smart windows have the ability to adjust their optical properties in response to changing boundary conditions and hence have the potential to improve the energy performance and the user comfort of buildings. The objective of this work is twofold: (1) To collect and present the state-of-the-art of commercially available smart windows from manufacturers, both adaptive and controllable products, i.e. thermochromic, photochromic and electrochromic smart windows. This collection provides the reader with valuable information about window properties such as the U-value, g-value, solar transmittance (Tsol) and visible solar transmittance (Tvis). However, it is currently difficult to obtain all the desired information about the products from the manufacturers' websites and other open channels. (2) To conduct building energy performance simulations on selected products from each technology. These products are also simulated using the same U-values as the reference window, and in addition, two theoretical cases have been simulated to investigate the theoretical potential of different smart windows. Here, the optical parameters take on fictitious values between 10 and 90% and between 0 and 100% transmittance, respectively. All cases are simulated at three different locations, i.e. Trondheim (Norway), Madrid (Spain) and Nairobi (Kenya), and are compared to a reference static window. In total, 63 cases are simulated using the simulation software package IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE). The results shows that the electrochromic window controlled by operative temperature has the highest potential in lowering the energy demand for all cases and locations. The study also highlights the importance of having the right control strategy and control levels for each specific case.

Abstract: Objective/Background
The impact of autoimmune cytopenias (AICs) on the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) clinical course and its prognostic significance remain a matter of controversial debate. This could be due to exclusion of patients with cytopenia from most clinical trials for this particular complication and the lack of standard diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches. We herein evaluate the prevalence and the prognostic significance of AICs among patients with CLL.
Methods
This is an observational retrospective study. Data on 101 patients with CLL were derived from the Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt, database, which contains information on demographic and clinical characteristics at diagnosis and follow-up records.
Results
The prevalence of immune cytopenias was 11.9% among patients studied. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia was the most common autoimmune form in patients with cytopenia due to pure immune etiology (C immune group) with a prevalence of 6.9%. Patients with AICs and those in the C immune subgroup presented with more unfavorable parameters. Besides, patients with AICs showed lesser response to treatment and on restaging after initial treatment, significantly more patients without AICs moved to a more favorable stage. However, no parallel significant difference in the overall survival was found between patients without AICs and those with AICs or with immune and combined or infiltrative cytopenia.
Conclusion
We have shown a prevalence of 11.8% for AIC among our CLL patients. AIC was associated with unsatisfactory normalization of the hematological parameters even with therapy and lower number of patients with CLL downstaging in comparison with patients without AIC. These results suggest that AIC is a fingerprint of a biologically more aggressive disease even if no significant impact on overall survival was found.

Abstract: Despite great increases in photovoltaic performance due to the insertion of ligand-exchanged PbS quantum dot layer via 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT), detailed carrier transport characteristics of solar cells with solution-phase ligand-exchanged PbS quantum dot (QD) still remains unknown. In this paper, relaxation time, recombination resistance, chemical capacitance, carrier lifetime, carrier diffusion length, and defect density corresponding to the depletion width were measured through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using the Schottky diode model to understand limiting factors for photovoltaic performance. The activation energy, which is estimated from the temperature-dependence of resistance, was reduced from 0.06 eV to 0.02 eV by inserting the PbS-EDT layer, leading to the improved photovoltaic performance. We also evaluated QD solar cells with varying thicknesses of PbS QD layers to investigate the impedance analysis and photovoltaic measurements. The depletion width as well as the carrier diffusion length was larger than the physical thickness of the layer, and this indicates that an increased short-circuit current density can be realized at the thick PbS QD layer due to the resulting large absorbance. Furthermore, the reduced trap density of the QD layer improves the open circuit voltage and fill factor. As a result, a high photoconversion efficiency of 9.41% was achieved.

Abstract: Performance monitoring of crystalline silicon solar cells often requires terminal voltage measurements, which are strongly influenced by the sample temperature via the large temperature dependence of the intrinsic carrier density. The impact of sample temperature variations can be corrected for by using the temperature coefficient of the terminal voltage, however this relies on having both accurate values for the temperature coefficient and accurate measurements of the sample temperature. This paper demonstrates that in situations where the sample temperature cannot be accurately measured, for example in some high volume production facilities or during module degradation experiments, implied voltages determined from either electroluminescence or photoluminescence provide a more accurate measure of sample performance than the terminal voltage. The results presented here show that implied voltages exhibit a temperature sensitivity that is one order of magnitude lower than that of the terminal voltage. This is largely due to the fact that luminescence intensity is not strongly temperature dependent around room temperature. This is confirmed by experimental temperature dependent measurements on four different crystalline silicon solar cell types. The benefit of using implied voltage measurements over temperature corrected terminal voltage measurements for the monitoring of light and elevated temperature induced degradation in silicon solar modules is demonstrated.

Abstract: Drift-diffusion modeling of the ionic dipole switching from the measurement of fast scanned and long pre-biased electrical response is proposed as a novel protocol for evaluation of limit hysteretic effects in perovskite solar cells. Up to eight systems were measured including CH3NH3PbI3, Cs0.1FA0.74MA0.13PbI2.48Br0.39 and FA0.83MA0.17Pb1.1Br0.22I2.98 3D perovskite absorbers, as well as 2D capping layers towards the selective contacts. We show systematic hysteretic patterns, even among typical hysteresis-free devices, including normal and inverted hysteresis as general dissimilar trend between CH3NH3PbI3 and mixed perovskite cells, respectively. Particularly, strong changes in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) were identified, in addition to different trends affecting the fill factor (FF) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc). The changes in Jsc were analyzed with state-of-the-art numerical drift-diffusion simulations concluding in an important reduction in the charge collection due to ionic distribution switching depending on the pre-biasing protocol and the type of absorbing perovskite. It is shown that mixed perovskites inhibit ionic dipolar switching. In addition, our calculi signal on the required conditions for the occurrence of inverted hysteresis and changes in the Voc. Regarding the FF and Voc patterns a new empirical approach is introduced and corresponding interpretations are proposed.

Abstract: Solar cells based on CuInSe2 (CIS) with absorber bandgap 1.0 eV are excellent candidates for a bottom cell in a tandem solar cell. This work investigates the effect of alloys of Ag and small amounts of Ga as an approach to improve the efficiency of CIS-based solar cells with bandgap less than 1.1 eV. Ga and Ag influence the surface morphology of the absorber layer, and Ag alloyed solar cells also have an increased concentration of Ag relative to Cu at the surface. Despite these structural and compositional differences compared to CuInSe2, the device with the highest efficiency incorporates a mixture of Ga and Ag alloying to form (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)Se2, where Ga addition improves the open circuit voltage and Ag addition improves the short circuit current. Ag improves current collection from long wavelength light due to the larger space charge width of Ag alloyed solar cells. However, Ag alloyed devices demonstrate lower VOC due to an interface recombination mechanism.

Abstract: Altered or aberrant expression of several splicing factors leads to the progression of different cancers. Though there are several ongoing studies underscoring the role of the splicing regulator polypyrimidine tract binding protein 2 (PTBP2) in neuronal cells, we unveil the role of PTBP2 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Different RNA binding proteins (RBP's) earlier reported in chronic myeloid leukemia blast crisis (CML-BC) cases (n = 28) from Radich Oncomine leukemia dataset, were compared. We observed increased expression of MSI2 followed by PTBP2 in BC cases and increased PTBP2 expression in relapsed cases (n = 10) from the same dataset compared to other RBPs. We also observed increased PTBP2 exon 10 inclusion in KCL22, a granulocytic lineage CML cell line when compared to other CML cell lines of different lineages. As PTBP2 protein expression is associated with PTBP2 exon 10 inclusion, we observed in cell lines and in a set of progressed cases (n = 4) that increased BCR-ABL1 expression potentiates PTBP2 exon 10 inclusion and thus confers the existence of a functional protein. Inhibition of BCR-ABL1 with imatinib not only blocks the inclusion of exon 10 but also deregulates PTBP2 expression in CML cells. Knockdown of PTBP2 in KCL22 cells leads to reduced cell proliferation, increased G2/M cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. Taken together our study portrays PTBP2 as a new possible target for CML and progressive inclusion/exclusion of PTBP2 exon 10 might play an important role in CML progression.

Abstract: The functionality of photovoltaic devices (such as, solar cells) is converting photons to electricity. Characterization of photovoltaic devices is essential at production level and during use. Here we put forward a new concept of functional imaging for photovoltaic devices. Based on the concept, we also propose an optical technique that can simultaneously acquire functionality and structure images of a single or multiple photovoltaic devices. The technique is simple, low-cost, effective, and efficient. It requires no mechanic motion and instead structured illumination is adopted for image acquisition. The complementary information provided by the functionality and structure images acquired allows one to better identify any existing and developing faults of photovoltaic devices. What's more, the technique is able to give reliable results with much fewer measurements than image pixels by exploiting the sparsity of functionality and structure images in the Fourier domain. The technique allows not only users to monitor the ‘health condition’ of the utilized devices, but also manufacturers to improve their fabrication conditions. The proposed technique may be applicable for rapid characterization for other semiconductor-based devices.

Abstract: The use of solid particles as heat transfer fluid (HTF) presents a great potential to overcome drawbacks addressed in commercial Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants. The solid particles thermal energy storage (TES) system allows achieving both high thermal performance at high temperature and low cost from the material perspective. The conversion efficiency of CSP solid particles-based systems at high temperatures strongly depends on the optical properties and thermophysical properties of materials used both as HTF and as storage medium. The present study is aimed to provide more experimental data and evidences of the potential in using particulate solids for CSP application. The solar absorptance and the specific heat capacity of silicon carbide (SiC), silica sand (SiO2), and hematite (Fe2O3) are studied after different aging times at 750 °C and 900 °C. The solar absorptance slightly increases over the aging process except for the silica sand, which decreases its absorptance in the first 100 h, reaching a plateau. After the aging treatment, the specific heat capacity is increased for both SiC and silica sand. However, for the iron oxide the specific heat capacity is lower after aging. The black silicon carbide SiC is proven to be the best option to be used up to 900 °C as it shows the highest solar absorptance (96%) and the highest heat storage capacity.

Abstract: Reversible electrochromic mirror by electroplating and electrodissolution of Ag film has been successfully formed onto transparent ITO electrode, without using Ag bromide ion complex. Pd nanoparticles were firstly deposited onto ITO electrode by chronopotentiometry as the pretreatment for forming mirror surface of Ag film. Without Pd nanoparticles on ITO electrode, the deposited Ag film becomes opaque white in appearance because of light scattering from less dispersive and quite large Ag hemispheric crystals on the ITO electrode. However, Ag mirror surface formation also required an addition to the electrolyte in addition to the deposition of Pd nanoparticles on the ITO electrode. Electrolyte additives 2-hydroxypyridine (2-HP) and citric acid were investigated for this purpose. Yellow color smooth Ag mirror surface was achieved at the electroplating condition of the constant cathodic current using 2-HP but electrodissolution of Ag film at the constant anodic current was imperfect due to remaining residue onto ITO electrode and the color of the Ag plating solution (electrolyte) changed from transparent to brown due to the oxidation of this additive. However, when citric acid was used as an additive, a smooth Ag mirror surface was created by electroplating using constant cathodic current. The SEM observation shows anisotropic Ag crystal growth as similar as that for the 2-HP additive. The plating time to form Ag mirror state became shorter than that for the 2-HP additive because the anisotropy ratio of citric acid would be larger than that of 2-HP. The electrodissolution of Ag film at the constant anodic current with citric acid shows that it’s almost back to the transparent ITO electrode at the transmittance of ca. 70% and the solution color of the electroplating bath is colorless and clear.

Abstract: The past few decades have delivered significant improvements in diagnosis and treatment of cancer, however, despite these improvements cancer continues to be a major global health issue requiring the urgent development of new strategies for treatment. Stress granules are cytoplasmic structures that triage gene expression in response to environmental stresses, including chemotherapies, and have been implicated in the development of drug resistance. One novel approach to developing a new anti-cancer strategy involves inhibiting stress granules with compounds derived from natural products. In a previous rapid screen, a subset of 132 compounds from the Davis Open Access Natural Product Library was screened using a stress granule inhibition assay and provisionally one hit was identified which was the known marine sponge-derived metabolite, psammaplysin F. Using cell based assays psammaplysin F was assessed to determine whether it could inhibit the formation of stress granules after exposure to sodium arsenite in Vero, HEK293 MCF7, T47D, HeLa and MCF7MDR cells by analysing the number of stress granules using high content imaging. A significant reduction in the number of stress granules was observed and subsequent analysis by western blot revealed that treatment with psammaplysin F decreased levels of phosphorylated eIF2α. Combinational studies in MCF7, HeLa and MCF7MDR cells revealed that psammaplysin F increased the efficacy of bortezomib and sorafenib and a synergistic effect was observed in vitro. Stress granules appear to be one tool in a battery of responses that cancer cells can exploit to elicit drug resistance. Disrupting stress granule formation by use of orally available drugs presents a potential mechanism to restore drug efficacy. The work presented here provides evidence that small molecules derived from nature, such as psammaplysin F, can prevent the formation of stress granules and therefore may represent a useful strategy to improving drug efficacy.

Abstract: Calcium (Ca2+), an important second messenger, regulates many cellular activities and varies spatiotemporally within the cell. Conventional methods to monitor Ca2+ changes, such as synthetic Ca2+ indicators, are not targetable, while genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECI) can be precisely directed to cellular compartments. GECIs are chimeric proteins composed of calmodulin (or other proteins that change conformation on Ca2+ binding) coupled with two fluorescent proteins that come closer together after an increase in [Ca2+], and enhance Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that allows for ratiometric [Ca2+] assessment. Here, adult rat ventricular myocytes were transfected with specifically targeted calmodulin-based GECIs and Ca2+ responses to a physiological stimulus, norepinephrine (NE, 10 μM), were observed in a) sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), b) mitochondria, c) the space between the mitochondria and SR, termed the Mitochondria Associated Membrane space (MAM) and d) cytosol for 10 min after stimulation. In SR and mitochondria, NE increased the [Ca2+] ratio by 17% and by 8%, respectively. In the MAM the [Ca2+] ratio decreased by 16%, while in cytosol [Ca2+] remained unchanged. In conclusion, adrenergic stimulation causes distinct responses in the cardiomyocyte SR, mitochondria and MAM. Additionally, our work provides a toolkit-update for targeted [Ca2+] measurements in multiple cellular compartments.

Abstract: Phase change material (PCM) is at the head of materials commonly used in latent heat storage. However, usually the main problem is that the heat conductivity of PCMs is low. Therefore, a novel solar air collector (SAC) combined the PCM-Rubitherm RT54HC with aluminum honeycomb was manufactured and investigated the effect of using honeycomb core on the collector thermal performance regarding heat storage with PCM under natural convection conditions. In the experiments, the heat storage material was tested in two forms with 26 kg capacity, PCM with honeycomb core in the first collector (type I) and only PCM in the second collector (type II), and also the third collector (type III) with a flat absorber plate for comparison. The first collector reached the PCM melting point about 50 min ago. Also, when we consider the peak point, an apparent 10 °C advantage is achieved in sensible heat storage in favor of type I. It is observed that the honeycomb core used as a heat transfer enhancer is effective in shortening the charge-discharge times, also a noticeable difference in sensible heat storage during the noon. The production of useful energy in Type I lasted 469 min and 539 min longer than type III, respectively. The thermal efficiencies under daylight were calculated as 10.1%, 10.9% and 13.6%, respectively. As a result, it can be said that the use of honeycomb core as heat conductivity enhancer material is very functional, in particular during the discharge period.

Abstract: A series of paraffin/expanded graphite (EG) composites with various mass fraction were prepared. The microscopic geometry configuration, thermal conductivity and saturation sorption capacity of EG were obtained. In this paper, a method based on the experiments of EG pores was proposed for constructing geometric models. The geometric model constructed by this method has obvious anisotropy and has been employed in the calculation. Furthermore, the numerical results of thermal conductivity indicate anisotropy of a single-pore. Moreover, it had been observed by experiment that the anisotropy is weakened and transformed to isotropy in the process of combining geometric models with a large number of single pores. The final numerical results agree well with the experiments, which validates the precision and reliability of the proposed model. The increasement of thermal conductivity is also calculated and discussed during the phase change process of paraffin/EG.

Abstract: High temperature corrosion is one of the most important issues for materials selection, structure design and service life prediction of engineering parts that are exposed to high temperature environments. The prevention of high temperature corrosive attacks on materials plays a critical role in aspects such as reliability, quality, safety and profitability of any industrial sector associated with high temperature process and in the study case, concentrated solar power (CSP) market, using inorganic molten salts as storage material. The aim of this research is the development of corrosion tests through conventional gravimetric techniques focussed on thermal energy storage (TES) materials as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis for storage systems monitoring. To mitigate corrosion, different alumina forming austenitic (AFA) alloys were exposed to the most promising molten salts to be proposed for the new generation of CSP plants, nitrate, carbonate and chloride molten salts. Ni base alloys showed a better behaviour in the corrosive environments and electrochemical impedance tests revealed the formation of a protective layer in the first 100 h. The gravimetric results and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses that were performed, confirmed the excellent behaviour of the steels tested in nitrate salts reducing the corrosion in these promising novel molten salts compared with the solar salt currently used in commercial CSP. On the other hand, carbonate and chloride molten salts showed a higher corrosion rate in the materials proposed, especially chloride molten salts.

Abstract: Nanofluids have been identified as one of the potential solar energy absorbing media to improve the performance of the photovoltaic-thermal (PV/T) system. Use of a nanofluid above the PV panel through optical filtration may improve the performance of PV/T systems. The aim of this study is to extend the current knowledge of the parameters affecting the optical behavior of water/silver nanofluid through analytical and experimental investigation. The effect of the optical path length and the concentration of the nanoparticles on the transmittance of water/Ag nanofluid were evaluated and an experimental correlation describing the relation was developed. The Rayleigh method was used to analytically evaluate the transmittance of nanofluid. Experiments were conducted at five concentrations of Ag from 0.0005 wt % to 0.05 wt % using a UV–vis spectrophotometer at path lengths of 2 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm. Experimental results were used to develop a correlation on the transmittance of water/silver nanofluid with the concentrations and optical path length of nanofluid. The transmittance of water/Ag nanofluid depends on the optical path length and concentration of the nanoparticles. The transmittance is higher at shorter path lengths and low concentrations. The effects are most pronounced in the spectral range from 250 nm to 1400 nm. The performance of a PV/T system with optical filtration showed better overall performance than the standalone PV system at low concentration. The outcomes of this study are useful in understanding the effect of using an optical filtration layer in PV/T solar collectors in capturing more energy.

Abstract: Graphene oxides are prepared under various pH values and their photovoltaic performance is evaluated using conventional organic photovoltaic devices. Acidic pH values demonstrated graphene oxide with more oxygen-functional groups and lower surface areas but with broader pore size distributions than those in basic medium. The pristine graphene oxide organic photovoltaic shows slightly better photovoltaic performance mainly due to high short-circuit current density, while the graphene produced under neutral or acidic conditions are slightly less efficient.

Abstract: Visible light active semiconductor Bi2WO6 photoelectrodes with desired physical and chemical properties are sought for solar energy conversion and photocatalytic applications. The porous nanostructured Bi2WO6 photoelectrodes are prepared by Spray Pyrolysis (SP). A detail study has been conducted to correlate the annealing temperature, morphology and crystallographic orientation with the photoelectrochemical (PEC), electrochemical and photocatalytic properties. The photoelectrodes possess an optical bandgap of 2.82 eV and exhibit anodic photocurrent. The current-voltage characterization of Bi2WO6 photoelectrodes reveals that the photocurrent density and photocurrent onset potential is strongly dependent on the deposition parameters. The PEC study shows that the photoelectrode annealed at 525 °C has photocurrent density of 42 μAcm−2 at 0.23 V (vs Ag/AgCl/3M KCl) under AM1.5 illumination and exhibit superior photocatalytic activity for Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation. The electrochemical study shows that the photoelectrode has flatband potential of 2.85 V which is in good agreement with photocurrent onset potential. This finding will have a significant influence on further exploitation of Bi2WO6 as a potential semiconductor material in solar energy conversion and photocatalytic applications.

Abstract: In this study, a nanoparticulated synthesis based surface modification was applied to a Prussian blue analogue (PBA), ruthenium purple (Fe4[Ru(CN)6]3, RP). The RP nanoparticles (nRP) with significantly enhanced electrical and ionic conductivities were compared to their micro-scale counterpart (mRP). By reducing the kinetic barriers during electrochemical cycling, nRP showed pronounced enhancement in the optical properties including higher transmittance change (ΔT), shorter response time, faster redox kinetics, and better cycling stability. A novel complementary electrochromic device (ECD) was proposed to utilize nRP as the anodically coloring material and Fe(II)-based metallo-supramolecular polymer (Fe(II)-MEPE) as the cathodically coloring material. Both anodically and cathodically coloring materials exhibited maximum optical modulation around 550 nm, which is the most sensitive light spectrum to human eyes in the visible region. Upon applying potential biases between 0.3 and 1.3 V to the Fe(II)-MEPE/nRP ECD, a large transmittance change of 50.7% at 580 nm, fast response times of 0.4 s both in coloring/bleaching, and a high coloration efficiency of 512.5 cm2/C at 580 nm were observed. At the same operation condition, the proposed ECD retained 96.4% of its initial ΔT after 10,000 cycles of continuous switching.

Abstract: We report an alternative method adopting Near InfraRed (NIR) radiations for annealing CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) films. This technique provides fast crystallization of perovskite domains as thermal energy is transferred through radiation (non-contact) as well as conduction (contact) mode. While, in case of conventional annealing method (hot plate), thermal energy is released through conduction (contact) mode only. The champion cell fabricated via NIR radiation annealing method shows power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.33% compared to 10.92% by conventional hot plate thermal annealing. The films are characterized by morphological (SEM), optical (UV-ViS) and structural (XRD) aspects. The improved performance owes to smooth and compact morphology, higher absorption, enhanced crystallinity, lower series resistance, improved charge separation and collection in case of NIR annealed perovskite films. The charge transfer resistance and series resistance of interfaces are manifested by Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It can be stated that method and mode of annealing plays a great role in crystallization of perovskite films, which can be adopted for large area industrial processing techniques for these materials.

Abstract: A kind of silicone rubber (SR)/paraffin (Pa)@silicon dioxide (SiO2) composite form-stable phase change material (PCM) was developed in this paper. Pa@SiO2 was obtained by choosing Pa as PCM core microencapsulated in SiO2 shell based on tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and γ-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) as precursors, then Pa@SiO2 microencapsules were embedded in SR matrix to fabricate SR/Pa@SiO2 composites. The SiO2 shell can provide a barrier for the melted Pa and meanwhile have reinforcing effect on SR as inorganic filler. The in-situ modification of SiO2 shell using APTES owing to the amino groups can not only prevent agglomeration, but also increase interfacial bonding between Pa@SiO2 with SR. The thermal and mechanical properties of the form-stable PCMs were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and mechanical tests. The results showed that the thermal and mechanical properties of SR/Pa@SiO2 composites were better than those of SR/Pa and SR/Pa/SiO2. Leakage test was conducted by heating the prepared composites over the melting temperature of Pa. The SR/Pa@SiO2 composites were found as form-stable PCM with low leakage rate. The phase change latent heat of the SR/Pa@SiO2 composites was up to 92.39 J g−1 and the composites can be used for thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Optimal coatings on receivers for concentrated solar power plants (CSP) not only need to have high solar absorptance, but should also possess superior stability in air at elevated temperatures. For next-generation CSP plants, the surface temperature of the receivers is expected to exceed 750 °C. In this work, we systematically studied optical properties and long term thermal stability of solar absorbing coatings (SACs) made from various Cu(II) containing spinel oxide nanoparticles, including CuCr2O4, Cu0·5Cr1·1Mn1·4O4, CuFeMnO4, and compared these properties to those of the state-of-the-art Pyromark 2500 coating. The solar absorptance of each sample was measured after isothermal annealing at 800 °C in air for durations of 100, 300, 1000, and 2000 h. We found that porous Cu0·5Cr1·1Mn1·4O4 had the highest solar absorptance at 97.1% before the thermal annealing and remained the highest throughout thermal testing, remained at 97.2% after 2000 h, whereas Pyromark 2500 exhibited considerable degradation in solar absorptance, from 96.4% to 94.6%. We analyzed the chemical composition, microstructures, and particle sizes of all the samples before and after the thermal annealing and discussed their implications on optical properties and thermal stability.

Abstract: The aim of our study is to see the performance of polymeric hybrid PVT collectors, which will be used to analyze the effects of Joule heating on the thermal performance of hybrid PVT collectors, especially for indoor experiments. Polymeric material has been used in hybrid PVT collectors and even longer used on flat plate collectors, generally for solar energy applications. We have developed a hybrid PVT collector with an absorber made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) combined with copper sheet. We use PMMA because it is easier to make and assemble into a hybrid PVT. In addition, PMMA also has excellent properties in optical transmittance, ultraviolet resistance, and referred absorbtance. In order to understand the details of the thermal and electrical performance of this polymeric PVT collector, we have conducted a series of four experiments by varying the mass flow rate, irradiance, and inlet water temperature. The results showed that PMMA as a thermal absorber with a copper sheet on a PVT collector can provide a beneficial cooling effect of around 80% thermal efficiency and a 0.03%/oC decrease in electrical efficiency. A steady state was reached about 30 min from the start of the experiment with a deviation of less than 4%, giving the optimum PVT efficiency at Tpvof 40–45 oC. Overall, PMMA can be used as an excellent alternative absorber for T-part in hybrid PVT collectors and is suitable for low-temperature applications.

Abstract: The mystery surrounding the role of hydrogen in light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID) of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells is attracting a lot of interest in the photovoltaic community. It is still unclear whether hydrogen plays a role in the degradation or the regeneration phase, with convincing evidence reported for both. In this paper, we base our work on the hypothesis that hydrogen plays a role in both phases depending on its charge state. Hydrogen in at least one charge state can passivate the LeTID defect. Thus, it is possible to mitigate LeTID in mc-Si by controlling the charge state of hydrogen. We observe in our experiments that the sequence of different thermal anneals impacts the degree of degradation. We also explore the possibility of mitigating LeTID by annealing the samples in a forming gas atmosphere. P-type mc-Si samples that received a forming gas anneal (FGA) show an improvement of the effective carrier lifetime when subjected to 1-Sun light soaking at 80 °C. Mc-Si PERC solar cells fabricated by incorporating a FGA anneal step show about 1.5% (relative) maximum drop in efficiency during 300 h of light soaking, as compared to about 3.2% (relative) maximum drop for cells fabricated by annealing in atmospheric air (without FGA), and 5.3% (relative) maximum drop for non-annealed cells. It thus seems that, after optimization, FGA is an easy to implement solution to minimise LeTID in industrial mc-Si solar cells.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers globally. A large portion of colorectal cancer patients who are treated with conventional chemotherapy eventually develop local recurrence or metastases. The failure of a complete cure in colorectal cancer patients may be related to the lack of complete eradication of cancer stem cells when using conventional therapy. Colorectal cancer stem cells comprise a small population of tumor cells that possess the properties of rapid proliferation and differentiation. The colorectal cancer stem cells are also phenotypically and molecularly distinct, and resistant to conventional chemo-radiotherapy. Therefore, it is important to identify approaches in combination with conventional therapy for targeting and eradicating cancer cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the main findings of recent studies on targeting colorectal cancer stem cells as a novel therapeutic approach in colorectal cancer treatment.

Abstract: In this study, alkaline salt was added into the activated alumina/zeolite 13X hybrid adsorbents to improve the energy density of the adsorbents and lower the regeneration temperature. A series of activated alumina/zeolite 13X hybrid adsorbents with/without 10% alkaline salt added were tested using an experimental system built and designed in our lab. The effects of the regeneration temperature and relative humidity (RH) on the materials’ behavior and their experimental energy density at different operating conditions were discussed. An energy density of 215 kWh/m3 was obtained with the regeneration temperature of 250 °C at 90% relative humidity.

Abstract: The latent heat thermal storage using Phase Change Materials (PCMs) is one of the essential aspects to be addressed for rapid expansion of utilisation of Renewable Energy sources and waste heat. The major disadvantage of PCMs, deployed in such thermal storage systems, is their low thermal conductivity and, in some cases, low latent heat. Paraffin wax/expanded graphite (PW/EG) composite PCMs with the EG mass fraction of 2%, 4%, and 6% were prepared by absorption of molten organic material into the EG structure. FireCarb TEG-315 and FireCarb TEG-160 were used as EG of A- and B-type, respectively, and PW 53–57 °C was deployed as the PCM in this study. Polarizing optical microscope, scanning electron microscopes and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the structure of composite PCMs. Thermal properties of pure Paraffin and produced composite materials were determined using a differential scanning calorimeter and thermal conductivity analyser. One of originalities of this work is that the statistical method of assessment of heterogeneity in composite PCMs was proposed for the first time with the use of Matlab software. This method was deployed for the quantitative assessment of uniformity of the EG distribution in composite PCMs structure. The novelty of obtained results is in detection of intermolecular interaction between B-type EG and PW. This interaction further enhances thermo-physical properties of the PW/EG composites. In contrast to pure PW and PW/A-type EG composite PCMs, in which the solid-solid transition and solid-liquid phase change are observed, PW/B-type EG compositions exhibit only the solid-liquid phase change. The heat storage capacity in both types of compositions was found to be almost identical. Despite of prolonged sample's ultrasonic treatment, the structure of PCM compositions was found to be far from being homogeneous. However, the thermal conductivity of compositions with 6 wt % of EG was determined to be 0.977 W/m°C for the PCM with A-type EG and 1.263 W/m°C for the PCM with B-type EG in comparison with the value of 0.258 W/m°C for pure PW. These values of the thermal conductivity correspond to the enhancement ratios of 3.79 and 4.9, respectively. If uniformity in the EG distribution in PW can be improved, then the thermal conductivity of composite PCMs would also considerably increase. Findings of this work are being used for designing a cost efficient solar thermal storage system with the reduced charging/discharging times as a part of an international project funded by EC.

Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting is an environmentally friendly technique for oxygen evolution. Vacancy-rich layered materials with good electromigration properties are of great interests. Herein, we synthesized full-spectrum responsive vacancy-rich BiO2-x ultra-thin nanosheets (UTNSs). The band gap is narrowed and the edge of valence band is increased in the BiO2-x UTNSs, which are responsible for the enhanced light response and are confirmed by UV–Vis–NIR diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), electronic spin resonance (ESR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and valence measurement. Compared to Bi2O3 nanosheets (NSs), BiO2-x UTNSs exhibits enhanced photocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution under full-spectrum irradiation, which can be attributed to the oxygen vacancies. The presence of oxygen vacancies in BiO2-x UTNSs promote the oxidation ability. This finding provides defect level understanding for developing highly efficient full-spectrum light responsive photocatalysts.

Abstract: We investigate the absorptance and the power conversion efficiency of a perovskite thin-film solar cell at a specular and Lambertian reflection on the cell's back-surface reflector. The analysis is done by means of the Monte-Carlo ray tracing simulations, complemented by the transfer-matrix method to account for the interference phenomenon in the local generation rate G(z) of carriers inside the semiconductor. This function is employed further in the transport equations to calculate the current-voltage characteristics of the cell. Taking the perovskite absorber CH3NH3PbI3 as an example, we analyse its efficiency, altering the absorber thickness in the interval 50 ÷ 1000 nm. We find that in the cell (∼200 nm) the enhanced photon absorption due to the Lambertian reflection yields the efficiency increase on 2.2% as opposed to the specular reflection case. Moreover, the maximum efficiency, obtained for the perovskite layer of the thickness ∼150 nm, exceeds the one obtained for the perovskite layer of the thickness ∼500 nm with the specular reflection.

Abstract: Paraffin is mainly preferred as an organic phase change material (PCM) in thermal energy storage (TES) systems especially for cooling and heating of buildings implementations. In order to develop form-stable and thermally stable blends natural minerals (Colemanite, Ulexite and Mg(OH)2) were used to prepare composites via direct impregnation method. These mineral compounds are abundant locally and known to be thermally stable as they show multi-step thermal decompositions. Thermal, morphological and chemical properties of these composites were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Results of analyses indicate that the introduction of mineral phase to the paraffin is achieved adequately despite of minor mixing problems that show a form-stable behaviour. Comparing energy storage abilities of these composites, Mg(OH)2 or Colemanite containing blends are found to be the promising composites.

Abstract: Alkali metal can improve the chalcopyrite structured device performance. However, such alkali metal is normally doped by diffusing Na into absorber layer from soda-lime glass or by vacuum method. In this study, a soft chemical method is applied to dope Na into kesterite structured compound film. Combined by XRD, SEM, SIMS, and EDS mapping, it indicates that the NaF aqueous solution treatment provides a unique Na source, which can promote the film growth and the elements distribution, especially Se element distribution. The surface decomposition of CZTSe is suppressed because of the Na participating in crystallization at the beginning stage of the selenization process, which can improve the interface between CdS and CZTSe. The average conversion efficiency of solar cell is improved from 6.3% without such treatment to above 7.8% with such chemical treatment and the best 8.4% efficiency has been achieved for the 0.005 mol/L NaF treated CZTSe device. This facile Na aqueous solution treatment afford a unique insight and also enlarge the understanding on the Na treatment on compound semiconductor solar cells, which will promote the fabrication of chalcopyrite solar cell with high performance.

Abstract: In the present work, kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) films were successfully prepared by tuning the cationic ratios (Zn/Sn and Cu/(Zn+Sn)) with DMF-based solution approach and the effect of cationic ratios on the performance of solar cells with the CZTSSe as absorbers was studied. Our results revealed that the interfacial secondary phases and interfacial structure of CZTSSe/Mo can be optimized by changing the cationic ratios so as to decrease the reverse saturation current (J0) and increase the shunt resistance (Rsh). And the photocurrent (JL) can be improved by broadened depletion region layer (Wd) of the solar cell due to decreased net hole concentration (NB) induced by decreased Cu/(Zn+Sn). By optimizing the cationic ratios, the CZTSSe solar cell with the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.01% was obtained at Cu/(Zn+Sn) = 0.75 ± 0.05 and Zn/Sn = 1.18 ± 0.02. The increase of PCE is mainly attributed to the decrease of interfacial secondary phases and the improvement of interfacial structure.

Abstract: In this work, we report studies on the incorporation of Ge into Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) films and a systematic investigation on the formation and properties of CZTS:Ge by a sequential process based on the sputtering of Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn metallic stacks followed by a reactive annealing under S atmosphere. Solar cells with the glass/Mo/CZTGS/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO architecture were fabricated and the role of the Ge-layer position as well as the thickness on the devices parameters was studied. For this purpose, different layer arrangements of the stacks were investigated, including: Mo/Ge/Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn, Mo/Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn/Ge and Mo/Ge/Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn/Ge. Devices made with the stack Mo/Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn/Ge resulted in best performance and were selected for further studies by varying the Ge layer thickness, concluding that with 5 nm thick Ge layer a 27% efficiency improvement over the reference cell was obtained (from 5.5% up to 7%). The EQE curve showed an improvement in the collection of photo generated carriers. The carrier concentration was determined to be in the range of 1 × 1016 - 1 × 1017 cm−3 for CZTGS films, which is in the range of the values reported for CZTS.

Abstract: Dual-band electrochromic device (Db-ECD) can tune visible and near-infrared (NIR) radiation independently. The Db-ECDs have inspired considerable interest for their potential applications in smart windows and camouflage. Organic small molecules and polymers were examined carefully though, exploring organics with dual-band electrochromism is still challenging. Herein, the triazine-centered viologen analogues, 2,4,6-tri(pyridyl-4-propyl)-1,3,5-triazine bromide (TPPT) and 2,4,6-tri(pyridyl-4-benzyl)-1,3,5-triazine bromide (TPBT) show excellent dual-band electrochromic behaviors with high dynamic contrasts (66.63% at 887 nm and 50.71% at 600 nm for TPPT, and 59.79% at 900 nm and 66.90% at 600 nm for TPBT, respectively). The Db-ECDs fabricated via gel electrolyte mixed with TPPT or TPBT can work at a low driving voltage down to ∼0.6 V, rendering a high coloration efficiency (up to 230.94 cm2 C-1) in the NIR region, the absorbance difference at 1037 nm reaching up to 2.58 for TPPT. This work sets the stage for novel organic materials of dual-band electrochromic gadgets.

Abstract: Chimeric RNAs are transcripts composed of RNA fragments from different genes and are traditionally well-known cancer-causing genetic events. Recent studies show chimeric RNAs being present in multiple non-neoplastic tissues and cells, suggesting that at least some may have roles in normal physiology. However, chimeric RNAs and their implications in brain development and neural differentiation have not been formally studied. Here, we firstly characterized the landscape of chimeric RNAs in human infant brain tissues and identified 599 chimeric RNAs. Through a series of filtering, 22 were selected and tested in a neural differentiation process starting from stem cells. Ten were validated experimentally. One of these ten chimeric RNAs, DUS4L-BCAP29, dramatically increased when human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells were induced for neural differentiation. Consistently, we found that overexpressed DUS4L-BCAP29 effectively promoted neural differentiation. Our results support the important role(s) chimeric RNAs play in neural differentiation, and are consistent with the new notion that chimeric RNAs also exist in normal physiology, and likely serve biological purposes.

Abstract: High capital expenditures associated with manufacturing thin silicon wafers make it difficult for the industry to scale up and prevent novel technologies from entering the market. Thin wafers fail largely due to breakage during solar cell processing and handling. One of the root causes for breakage is sub-mm edge cracks in the silicon wafer, and these cracks cannot be reliably detected by most commercially-available crack detection tools. In this work, we first investigate the correlation between wafer thickness and critical crack length, and explain the importance of detecting sub-500-μm edge cracks as the wafer thickness is reduced. Secondly, we extend our previous work of micro-crack detection to demonstrate an edge illumination technique using a near-infrared laser to image edge cracks less than 500 μm in length in multicrystalline silicon. Thirdly, we investigate two fundamental edge illumination mechanisms based on dark-field imaging; namely, direct and vicinal illumination. We will then compare these methods to a state-of-the-art rear illumination method. The advantages and disadvantages of both illumination methods are presented and provide an in-depth analysis of light-crack interaction. In particular, we find that the robustness of vicinal illumination is due to diffuse reflectance. The diffuse reflectance has less dependence on crack configurations, while direct illumination has more dependence on the crack configurations because it utilizes specular reflectance. Our results show that our proposed prototype can detect sub-mm edge cracks in multicrystalline silicon wafers, which is an important step in enabling thin silicon wafer manufacturing.

Abstract: Impedance spectroscopy is widely employed to evaluate electrochemical devices, and our group has been proposing its use as a novel diagnosis tool for photovoltaic modules. In this study, photovoltaic cells are subjected to several types of failure and degradation that frequently occur in polycrystalline photovoltaic cells, such as mechanical stress, interconnect ribbon disconnection, and potential-induced degradation. The impedance characteristics of these cells are measured as Nyquist plots, in addition to the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics to compare the characteristics among the failure modes and demonstrate the applicability of impedance spectroscopy as a potential photovoltaic module diagnosis tool. The equivalent circuit parameters, with and without failure and degradation, are obtained from the impedance characteristics and compared. The influence of bias voltage and temperature on the impedance characteristics are investigated prior to failure and degradation. The application of mechanical stress decreases the parallel resistance and moves the right edge of the Nyquist plot further inside the exact semicircle, while interconnection ribbon disconnection also decreases the parallel resistance and increases the series resistance, and potential-induced degradation decreases both the parallel resistance and capacitance.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) with early therapy failure (ETF) within 2 years of frontline therapy have poor overall survival (OS). We recently reported the results of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients from the Grupo Español de Linfomas y Trasplantes de Médula Ósea (GELTAMO) registry treated with rituximab prior to ASCT and with ETF after first-line immunochemotherapy, leading to 81% 5-year OS since ASCT. We explored whether ASCT is also an effective option in the pre-rituximab era—that is, in patients treated in induction and rescued only with chemotherapy.
Methods
ETF was defined as relapse/progression within 2 years of starting first-line therapy. We identified two groups: the ETF cohort (n = 87) and the non-ETF cohort (n = 47 patients receiving ASCT but not experiencing ETF following first-line therapy).
Results
There was a significant difference in 5-year progression-free survival between the ETF and non-ETF cohorts (43% vs. 57%, respectively; p = .048). Nevertheless, in patients with ETF with an interval from first relapse after primary treatment to ASCT of <1 year, no differences were observed in 5-year progression-free survival (48% vs. 66%, respectively; p = .44) or in 5-year OS (69% vs. 77%, p = .4). Patients in the ETF cohort transplanted in complete remission showed a plateau in the OS curves, at 56%, beyond 13.7 years of follow-up.
Conclusion
ASCT may be a curative option for ETF in patients who respond to rescue chemotherapy, without the need for immunotherapy or other therapies, and should be considered as an early consolidation, especially in patients with difficult access to rituximab.

Abstract: In this work we present a new epitaxial lift-off (ELO) approach based on the use of a strained AlAs/InAlAs superlattice (SL) as sacrificial layer for InP related materials. Such an ELO process enables the fabrication and transfer of a thin active III-V heterostructure via its separation from its III-V parent substrate using selective chemical etching. The strategy is of particular interest for large area devices such as solar cells. The process studied here also allows the substrate reuse for a low-cost approach based on III-V-based device fabrication. In order to realize the ELO process on InP substrates, the main difficulty is the lack of lattice-matched materials offering the high chemical etching selectivity needed over both the substrate and the lattice-matched alloys of the active heterostructure. The present study therefore contributes effective strategy for overcoming the latter constraints. The AlAs/InAlAs SL was thus explored as a potential candidate as sacrificial layer for the InP lattice matched materials. The growth conditions of such SLs were investigated to produce low defect SLs compatible with the properties of an optimal sacrificial layer. The under-etching behavior of such SLs in a hydrofluoric acid-based solution was also studied in detail. The results show that advantageous under-etching rates, high enough for a full wafer detachment, combined with a low defect density, can be obtained with novel sacrificial layers based on such thin AlAs/InAlAs SL. Finally, the fabrication of solar cells via an active heterostructure grown over an optimized SL on a monolithic substrate and via a thin reported active heterostructure was performed. The solar cells perform well and demonstrate the suitability of such SLs as a sacrificial layer for InP related materials.

Abstract: We have identified modifications of material distributions in inverted organic solar cell structures during accelerated aging processes that are potentially linked to the loss of the mechanical integrity of the devices. Non-encapsulated devices were treated with ISOS-D-3 ageing (the so called damp heat exposure at 85 °C/85% room humidity in the dark). After performing pull-off tests, the exposed surfaces were analyzed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. For fresh devices, the results revealed that mechanical failure occurs close to the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM interface, in agreement with the literature. However, after a short exposure to damp heat, XPS investigations indicate an enrichment of PCBM at the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM interface and a change in the PEDOT:PSS surface composition. Both phenomena may explain the rapid drop in device performances and the increased tendency towards delamination.

Abstract: Solid-liquid phase change materials (PCMs) have been widely used in thermal energy storage (TES) systems. Fatty acids as organic solid-liquid PCMs have superiority properties like as high latent heat of storage capacity, suitable phase change temperature and low vapor pressure. However, for the use of solid-liquid PCMs are required a storage container. To meet this need, one of the most effective methods is encapsulation of the PCMs with proper polymeric shell. The encapsulation process provides PCMs several benefits such as preventing the liquid PCM outflow during phase transition, eliminating the interaction with its near environment, as well as providing a large surface area per volume. With this regard, the present study is aimed to encapsulate myristic acid-palmitic acid (MA-PA) eutectic mixture with polymethylmethacrylate(PMMA) as shell material. The prepared capsules were characterized using fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. FT-IR results confirmed successful encapsulation of the PCM within PMMA shell. Morphological investigations were made by using polarized optical microscopy (POM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. It can be deduced from the POM and SEM results that the synthesized PMMA/(MA-PA)(1:2) capsules were entirely spherical profile along due to agglomeration difficulty. The diameter distributions of the capsules were determined by particle size distribution (PSD) analysis and the findings showed that the capsules had diameter distributions between 0.1 and 300 µm. By differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique the melting temperature and latent heat storage capacity of PMMA/(MA-PA)(1:2) capsules were measured as about 38.0 °C and 100.5 J/g, respectively. The thermogravimetry (TGA) measurements indicated that the capsules were durable thermally up to 250 °C. Additionally, the produced capsules had excellent thermal and chemical stability after 5000 heating/cooling thermal cycles test. Consequently, especially PMMA/(MA-PA)(1:2) capsules are hopeful for TES applications.

Abstract: Radiative cooling is a passive cooling method that can radiate heat into the universe through transparent atmospheric windows. A good radiative cooler should possess not only a suitable emissive spectrum profile but also characteristics such as flexibility, large-area, low-cost, and angle-independency. To satisfy these demands, we propose an approach to fabricate a photonic crystal-structured UV-curable adhesive (PCSUVA) on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate using UV nanoimprint lithography. The PCSUVA-based radiative cooler has a near-ideal emissive spectrum in the wavelength range of 0.4–25 μm and the cooler is successful in cooling its object, no matter the object needs sunlight or not. When the PCSUVA is coated on a transparent substrate (i.e. PET), it can reduce the temperature of the underlying silicon wafer by 1.2 ± 0.2 °C, and when the PCSUVA is coated on PET backed with an Ag layer, it can reduce the temperature of the underlying silicon wafer by 7.7 ± 0.2 °C on a summer day. The achieved cooling effect can be attributed to the reflection of sunlight by the Ag layer and the thermal emission of the PCSUVA. The approach is cost-effective, making it a suitable candidate for a flexible, large-area, low-cost, and angle-independent radiative cooler.

Abstract: Studies have reported a high expression profile of microRNA-196a (miR-196a) in many cancers, which potently plays important roles in carcinogenesis. However, the involvement of miR-196a in affecting non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carcinogenesis still remains uncertain. NSCLC-related differentially expressed genes were retrieved for this study according to the microarray-based analysis, which demonstrated that miR-196a may be involved in NSCLC progression via regulation of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway by targeting glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3). Hence, this study aimed to explore the relationship among miR-196a, GPX3, and the JNK pathway and to investigate its functional regulations in NSCLC. Initially, highly-expressed miR-196a and lowly-expressed GPX3 were determined in NSCLC tissues and cells. Next, the NSCLC cells were manipulated with a series of mimic, inhibitor or shRNA to investigate the impact of miR-196a and GPX3 on CSC viability, proliferation, self-renewal ability and stemness. The in vivo effect of miR-196a was measured in nude mice xenografted with NSCLC cells. The results demonstrated that downregulation of miR-196a and restoration of GPX3 inhibited CSC viability, proliferation, self-renewal ability, stemness and tumorigenicity. Meanwhile, the underlying relationship among miR-196a, GPX3 and JNK pathway was explored by treatment with the JNK pathway inhibitor (SP600125), or sh-GPX3. Downregulated miR-196a and upregulated GPX3 could elevate the GPX3 protein expression and reduce the extent of JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. Taken together, miR-196a promotes the development of NSCLC via activation of the JNK pathway through down-regulation of GPX3 and serve as a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. Currently, Irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, is an approved anti-cancer drug for the treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. Considering low response rate and events of high toxicity caused by irinotecan, we evaluated a series of thirteen thiazolyl hydrazone derivatives of 1-indanone for their potential antineoplastic activity and four compounds showed promising anti-cancer activity against most of the tested colon cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.41 ± 0.19 to 6.85 ± 1.44 μM. It is noteworthy that the compound, N-Indan-1-ylidene-N'-(4-Biphenyl-4-yl-thiazol-2-yl)-hydrazine (ITH-6) is found to be more effective than irinotecan against colon cancer cells, HT-29, COLO 205, and KM 12. Mechanistic studies reveal that ITH-6 arrests these cancer cell lines in G2/M phase of the cell cycle, induces apoptosis and causes an increase in ROS level with a significant reduction in the GSH level. The mechanism of inhibition relates to the inhibition of tubulin polymerization in the mitotic phase. These findings suggest that ITH-6 is a novel drug candidate for the treatment of colorectal cancer.

Abstract: CZTS has kesterite structure and the composition's formula is Cu2ZnSn(S/Se)4. The efficiency of CZTS-Se (CopperZincTin-Sulphur-Selenium) solar cell, ∼12.6%, is much lower than the efficiency of CIGS (CopperIndiumGalliumSelenium) solar cell, ∼22.6%. But the CZTS-Se may be the counterpart of the CIGS and the efficiency may be increased up to 32.2% as theoretically predicted by the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit. In solar cell technology, it has been depicted that the efficiency of the solar are affected by the two parameters: (i) variation of the solar insolation and (ii) quality of the materials. Besides this, the narrow phase stability of quaternary phases, unfavorable band alignments, mid-gap states and band tails are main reasons of deficit in the efficiency of kesterite due to the coexistence of the secondary and ternary phases, carrier recombination at the interfaces, defects and series resistances. As a result, the kesterite solar cell has the fluctuated open circuit voltage and the loss of energy. In addition to this, the champion CZTS-Se solar cell is not so environmental friendly because Se is the toxic and the rare earth element. This review provides the vital approaches by discussing the proper materials processing and the appropriate solution to enhance the efficiency of kesterite (CZTS, CZTSe and CZTS/Se) solar cells. Due to the large area quality, high absorption and low-cost materials of the kesterite, it may be used directly in harvesting the solar energy. We have also discussed how to reduce the recombination of the electron-hole pairs by using the interfacial layer so that the efficiency of the kesterite solar cells can be improved.

Abstract: The failure and loss analysis of solar cells relies on the precise determination of their electrical performance parameters. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) used as light sources in solar simulators provide a number of advantages compared to conventional Xenon-based solar simulators. In this work, we present an approach to rapidly measure the quantum efficiency and the reflectivity that takes the spectral broadening of the LEDs fully into account. Our approach does not rely on any specific shape of the spectral peaks and can thus be applied to any type of quasi-monochromatic light source. The two proposed methods yield valuable additional information on the solar cell performance and material properties that cannot be obtained by conventional solar simulators. Using LED solar simulators, they are completely in-line capable as they can be performed in less than one second.

Abstract: A simple yet reproducible method to deposit high quality aluminium oxide (AlOx) film by spray coating is presented. Excellent thickness and refractive index uniformity is demonstrated. The AlOx film was found to be nearly stoichiometric with an oxygen to aluminium ratio of 1.7 from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. An interfacial layer with thickness of about 2 nm was observed in transmission electron microscopy analysis. The interfacial layer was determined to be aluminium silicate from XPS data. Electrical characterization of the films on Czochralski (Cz) p-type silicon yielded dielectric constant of 6.5 and mean breakdown field of 4.7 MV cm−1. Interface state density of 8.7×1010 eV−1cm−2 and fixed charge density of −5.5×1012 cm−2 were obtained from the electrical characterization of metal insulator semiconductor capacitors. The excellent interface quality with low interface state density and high negative charge is suitable for passivation of p-type silicon in solar cell applications. Effective surface recombination velocity of 12 cm s−1 and 48 cm s−1 were obtained for Cz p-type silicon surface for annealing temperature of 750°C and 790°C respectively without the use of capping layer.

Abstract: Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) shows great promise in thin film photovoltaic application due to its reasonable band gap, low cost and non-toxic earth-abundant composition. Post-selenization is the generally adopted approach to obtain CZTSSe film with large-grain size. Thoroughly understanding and well controlling the grain growth process during selenization is thus essential for achieving high-performance solar cell devices. Here we demonstrate that the absorber microstructure can be adjusted by altering selenization conditions, especially the heating rate and annealing time. It is found that heating rate determines formation manner of top CZTSSe layer, while annealing time affects both the crystallization degree of bottom CZTSSe layer and the selenization of Mo contact layer. Properly adjusting the annealing time at an optimized heating rate is proven to successfully eliminate the fine-grain layer and obtain high quality CZTSSe thin films with large-size grains. Based on the observations, growth mechanisms for the microstructure development during selenization of solution processed Cu2ZnSnS4 films are suggested. Finally, CZTSSe device efficiency of 9.24% is achieved at an optimal selenization condition.

Abstract: Building-integrated photovoltaics are drawing much attention to make the built environment self-sufficient in terms of electricity. Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) can provide this electricity generation when used as photovoltaic windows. Paramount to an efficient LSC are non-overlapping absorption and emission spectra, to avoid self-absorption. This non-overlap can be achieved by absorbing incoming UV light and emitting in the red to infrared. In this article, we present a technique for optimizing LSCs without self-absorption, using Eu3+-doped AlN as a model system. The parameters affecting light absorption, emission and transport are extracted from a combinatorially sputtered gradient material library. This library results from a single deposition, with a gradient in thickness and Eu concentration. AlN:Eu3+ absorbs strongly until 450 nm, with a peak solar absorption of 499 cm−1 at%−1 at 350 nm due to a charge transfer band. The strongest emission is at 622 nm, thereby exhibiting no self-absorption. The presented optimization model strikes a balance between concentration quenching and absorptivity of Eu dopants by using the parameters extracted from the material library. For thicker films, concentration quenching can be avoided by using a lower dopant concentration, while still outperforming thinner films due to fast increasing absorption. The results demonstrate that, while AlN:Eu3+ itself should only be viewed as a model system, thin films doped with rare earths can yield industry-compatible, high efficiency LSCs because of their high absorption coefficients and lack of self-absorption.

Abstract: In this work, several ceramic materials were exposed together with two reference structural materials (i.e., 316 L stainless steel and Inconel 600) to a molten solar salt (40 wt% KNO3 and 60 wt% NaNO3) for 1000 h at 600 °C to investigate their compatibility with the molten salt medium, thus assessing their potential use in concentrated solar power (CSP) applications. The exposed ceramics included different SiC grades (solid state-sintered, liquid phase-sintered, and silicon-infiltrated) and MAX phase-based materials (Maxthal® 211 & 312 (nominally, Ti2AlC & Ti3SiC2, respectively), Cr2AlC, Nb4AlC3, (Nb,Zr)4AlC3, and a cermet comprising 40 vol% Fe and 60 vol% (Nb,Zr)4AlC3). All SiC grades were chemically stable in the molten salt, whereas all Nb-containing MAX phase ceramics were severely oxidized. Comparing the two Maxthal® grades showed that the 312 was chemically more stable than the 211, and both grades formed a Na-based oxide scale. Interestingly, Cr2AlC showed practically no interaction with the molten salt during the performed exposure, forming a stable, sub-micrometre-thick Cr7C3 scale. Hence, it may be considered as promising structural/coating material candidate for the targeted CSP application.

Abstract: Three semi-closed open cell ceramic foams, namely mullite, brown alumina and ceria-based materials, were subjected to thermal cycles by direct concentrated solar irradiation to study their thermal resistance in view of their potential application as photothermal devices, such as volumetric solar absorbers. After cycling, the extent of the damage in the samples was determined by measuring the retained crushing (compressive) strength. The extent of the damage was found to depend on the composition, the applied surface temperature difference (ΔT) of thermal cycling and the temperature gradient across the foams. It was found that the retained crushing strength gradually decreased with an increase in ΔT and was independent of the number of thermal cycles in the range investigated. The ceria foams displayed the poorest thermal shock resistance. Experimental data fit the Gibson-Ashby model for the thermal shock resistance of ceramic foams, for a constant C = 0.65.

Abstract: Low-temperature solution processable TiO2 nano-sol for electron transporting layer (ETL) of flexible perovskite solar cells is prepared by synthesizing TiO2 nano-sols by peptization in acidic aqueous solution and re-dispersing the TiO2 nanoparticles in H2O, ethanol (EtOH), dimethylsulfoxied (DMSO), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). By considering dielectric constant, zeta potential, and surface tension of solvent media, we found that the DMF is the best to form uniform TiO2 ETL by spin-coating among them because it has low surface tension and high zeta potential. Accordingly, we could demonstrate 18.2% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for rigid glass substrate based perovskite solar cells and 15.8% PCE for flexible polymer substrate based devices by low-temperature solution process.

Abstract: This work describes an effort to develop an antimicrobial agent (chlorogenic acid - CGA) loaded porous nanogel based on calcium phosphate-chitosan (CaPNP@Chi) nanogel with biofilm degradative properties and has potential applications in restorative dentistry. The nanogel was prepared by ionic gelation of calcium phosphate nanoparticles and chitosan in the ratio of 1.25: 1. Chlorogenic acid was loaded to the nanoparticles as an ethanolic solution and the encapsulation efficiency determined by chromatographic techniques. The particle size and morphology of CaPNP@Chi and CaPNP@Chi@CGA was determined by dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopic techniques. The minimum inhibitory concentration against S. aureus and K. pneumoniae was determined through the well diffusion method. The biofilm formation and biofilm decay were studied through staining assays. The toxicity, if any of the nanogel was assessed by MTT assay against HaCaT cells. All data were statistically analyzed. The composite had a CGA encapsulation efficiency of 70% and was thermally stable up to 124 °C. The zone of inhibition was found to be 18.7 mm ± 0.6 against S. aureus. CaPNP@Chi@CGA showed a 68% increase in biofilm degradation when compared with the untreated group. Results obtained in this study suggest that the positively charged nanogel interacted with the bacterial cell membrane and brought about the disruption of the cell membrane. Also, CaPNP@Chi@CGA was observed to be nontoxic up to 40 μg/mL to HaCaT cells. These results support the potential of CaPNP@Chi@CGA nanogel for biofilm degradation and its application as filling material in restorative dentistry.

Abstract: We have investigated the performance of a silicon solar cell coated with ZnO nanoparticle layers doped with iron varying from (0–20%). We synthesized nanoparticles using a microwave method and fabricated thin film layers on silicon solar cells through a spin coating technique. The structure and morphology of nanoparticles were analyzed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD). The size of the particles decreased as iron concentration increased from 0 to 15%. Optical properties were analyzed through photoluminescence (PL) and absorption spectroscopy. PL spectra show a blueshift in the near band edge emission peaks for 0–15% doped samples and a redshift for the 20% doped sample. The band gap of Fe–ZnO nanoparticles (0–15%) was found to increase from 3.20 eV to 3.24 eV, and the bandgap decreased to 3.22 eV for 20% Fe–ZnO nanoparticles. Current-Voltage measurements confirm the enhancement in power conversion efficiency by 30% with iron doping in ZnO up to 15%. Efficiency increased with nanoparticle layers up to 180.29 nm in every sample and decreased with further increase in thickness. Enhancement in external quantum efficiency (EQE) was also observed with the increase in dopant concentration up to 15%. The optimum thickness of the ZnO nanoparticle layer was found to be approximately 180 nm for maximum enhancement in conversion efficiency.

Abstract: ZnO nanoparticle (ZnO NP) exposure causes oxidative stress in the respiratory system, leading to pulmonary damage. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) participates in a variety of cellular stress responses. However, the role of ATF3 in ZnO NP genotoxicity and cytotoxicity remains to be explored. Here we reported that ZnO NP treatment dramatically induced the expression of ATF3 in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, which was mediated by the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). ATF3 was required for the repair of ZnO NP-induced DNA damage as gamma foci number increased when endogenous ATF3 was silenced. Moreover, ATF3 also contributed to ZnO NP-induced cell apoptosis. Mechanistic study revealed that ATF3 interacted with the p53 protein and upregulated its expression under ZnO NP treatment. Collectively, our findings demonstrated ATF3 as an important regulator of epithelial homeostasis by promoting both DNA repair and the death of damaged cells under ZnO NP-induced genotoxic stress.

Abstract: Ultrathin c-Si solar cells with their active layer thicknesses ranging from a few micrometers to several tens of micrometers will play a very important role in reducing the material costs of industrial c-Si solar cells. This work presents a new high efficiency light trapping scheme (HE-LTS) with two cavities for ultrathin c-Si solar cells. By analyzing the variations of the important optical parameters of each light trapping unit with its geometric parameters, the light trapping performances of the HE-LTS have been optimized. The results show that the light trapping abilities of the HE-LTS can exceed obviously that of Lambertian LTS in a broad range of geometric parameters for both TE and TM modes; the photocurrent densities of an ultrathin c-Si solar cell with the optimal HE-LTS can reach 36.65 mA/cm2 and 40.47 mA/cm2 for the TE and TM modes, respectively.

Abstract: Breast cancer is known as a most prevalent cancer and second deadly cancer, among women worldwide. Due to the high incidence rate of breast cancer and limitations of conventional therapy it seemed essential to look for new targets in cancer cells and directly target them such as target therapy on breast cancer stem cells. In this review we indicate some of therapeutic uses of cancer stem cells in breast cancer. Some strategies are targeting surface specific markers and activated signaling pathways in their microenvironment such as Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt/b-catenin, PI3K/Akt, NF-kB, BMP and TGF-β and their maintenance and drug resistance, using various miRNAs, enhancement of CSCs apoptosis, differentiation therapy, blocking epithelial to mesenchymal transition and using different natural compounds. Recent studies have shown that cancer stem cells play major roles in target therapy on breast cancer. The new manipulation approaches of cancer stem cells can be used as target therapy of breast cancer that were highlighted for immunotherapy of cancer.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown a highly efficient performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) of 22.7%. Although a number of efforts have been made to reproduce flat, uniform, and dense perovskite films using a stoichiometric ratio of 'CH3NH3I: PbI2: DMSO = 1:1:1′, several complicated processes are required to achieve a regular grain-to-grain uniformity. Therefore, it was difficult to reproduce. This is because the conventional ratio of 'CH3NH3I: PbI2: DMSO = 1:1:1′ can cause the CH3NH3I-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase and the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal phase to coexist in solution. As a result, the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals in the solution may deteriorate the quality of the thin film. In this study, the non-stoichiometric molar ratio among CH3NH3I:PbI2:DMSO solutions was applied to control the quality of the perovskite layers. We successfully fabricated uniform and dense CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs, by simply manipulating CH3NH3PbI3 solubility with the different DMSO molar amounts. Further, a homogeneous grain size and a regular inter-grain arrangement with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were obtained in the optimized solubility. We also confirmed that the PSCs with the optimized condition exhibited higher Jsc (Current density) and PCE (Power Conversion Efficiency), due to the Lamer model effect on the enhancement of the internal light absorption. Furthermore, the device with the optimized solubility exhibited enhanced electrical properties. Especially, the improved-electrical properties of the charge carrier-separation, mobility, collection, generation, and resistances were confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) quenching/mapping of the space-charge limited current (SCLC), the photo current density as a function of internal voltage (Jph–Vint) characteristic, and the impedance. Consequently, it was shown that tailoring the solubility of CH3NH3PbI3 can have a critical effect on the production of high quality perovskite thin films. These films will have an appropriate particle size and uniformity that will have a promising approach for generating high current densities.

Abstract: In this work we develop a rear emitter silicon solar cell integrating carrier-selective passivating contacts (CSPCs) with different thermal budget in the same device. The solar cell consists of a B-doped poly-Si/SiOx hole collector and an i/n hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) stack acting as electron collector placed on the planar rear and textured front side, respectively. We investigate the passivation properties of both CSPCs on symmetric structures by optimizing the interdependency among annealing temperature, time and environment. The optimized B-doped poly-Si/SiOx reaches a saturation current density of ~10 fA/cm2 on n-type wafers and an implied open circuit voltage (iVOC) of 716 mV. Furthermore, the i/n a-Si:H stack shows an effective carrier lifetime above 4 ms and iVOC of ~705 mV for cell-relevant layers thickness. After a post-deposition annealing in H2, lifetime is above 10 ms and iVOC = 708 mV. Finally, we optimize the optoelectronic properties of indium-based transparent conductive oxide (Indium Tin Oxide ITO and hydrogenated indium oxide IO:H) to reduce parasitic absorption with a gain in short circuit current density of 0.23 mA/cm2. In conclusion, the optimized layer stacks are implemented at device level obtaining a device with VOC = 704 mV, fill factor of 73.8%, a short circuit current of 39.7 mA/cm2 and 21.0% aperture-area conversion efficiency.

Abstract: In order to study the effects of EG (expanded graphite) content and SiO2 nanoparticles on the specific heat and thermal conductivity of nano-SiO2/NaNO3–KNO3/EG composite heat storage materials, a series of nano-SiO2/NaNO3–KNO3/EG composites are prepared by the aqueous solution-ultrasound oscillation method. The nano-SiO2/NaNO3–KNO3 and EG with different mass fractions (5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) are used as heat storage material and matrix material, respectively. The specific heat and thermal conductivity of the composite are measured by STA (Simultaneous Thermal Analysis) and LFA (Laser Flash Apparatus), respectively. The results show that nano-SiO2/NaNO3–KNO3/EG composite exhibits obvious better performance than pure binary nitrate NaNO3–KNO3. With 15 wt% EG, the average specific heat (from 250 °C to 430 °C) and thermal conductivity of the composite are 2.574 J/(g·K) and 6.05 W/(m·K), respectively, which are 1.69 times and 9 times higher than that of pure binary nitrate. After adding 1 wt% nano-SiO2 to NaNO3–KNO3/EG (15 wt%) composite, the average specific heat and thermal conductivity increase by 44% and 60.9%, respectively. From the above results, the composite heat storage materials prepared by adding EG and nano-SiO2 into binary nitrate are considered as promising candidate materials for high heat transfer performance.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a facile and feasible strategy to prepare natural tubular clay halloysites nanotubes (HNT)@poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanocomposites as an electrochromic material. The HNT@PEDOT nanocomposites were formed by coating PEDOT on the outer surface of HNT through in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization. Due to the hollow tubular and hierarchical porous structure of the hybrid nanocomposites, the surface area of active materials is enlarged and the diffusion distance of ions is shortened. Consequently, the HNT@PEDOT film delivers higher optical contrast (59.3%), coloration efficiency value (174.3 cm2/C) and long-cycle stability compared to pure PEDOT film. Besides, the as-prepared solution processable electrochromic material enables the utilization of printing or spraying methods and applies for large area and patterned films.

Abstract: The increasing number of subcells in multi-junction structures imposes the use of narrow bandgaps for a full harvesting of the solar spectrum. In this context, gallium antimonide (GaSb) and its lattice-matched alloys offer a great potential. To date, GaSb-based multi-junction solar cells exhibit experimental results below theoretical expectations, due to a limiting GaSb subcell. In this paper, a new design of GaSb cells comprising an Al0.50Ga0.50As0.04Sb0.96 window layer is studied. With this design, an excellent conversion efficiency of 7.2% is achieved under 1 sun (AM1.5G) illumination. This performance is attributed to a significant improvement in short-circuit current.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCM) are suitable to store high thermal energy densities in narrow temperature ranges due to the phase change from solid to liquid. Sugar alcohols are potential PCMs in the temperature range between 100 °C and 250 °C. Their melting enthalpy is higher than the one of most other PCMs, but their latent heat tends to degrade when heated above the melting temperature. In the present study, degradation rates of the sugar alcohol d-mannitol at three temperatures above the melting temperature are examined and strategies to enhance its thermal stability are demonstrated. These are the use of an antioxidant and the exposure to an inert atmosphere. The degradation shows the highest rate for pure d-mannitol under air and the lowest one for a mixture of PCM and antioxidant under argon. The thermal stability of pure d-mannitol under argon is higher than the one for a mixture of d-mannitol and antioxidants under air. The use of antioxidants and argon or their combination yield to an improved stability compared to pure d-mannitol under air, but cannot stop the degradation completely under the performed conditions.

Abstract: Abstracts
In0.024Cd0.976O thin films were inserted between two layers of Ga0.04Zn0.96O films, in an effort to improve the electrical properties of the oxide film. The multilayer structure with an optimum InCdO layer thickness of ∼30 nm showed significantly improved electrical properties without seriously deteriorating the optical properties, with an average optical transmittance of ∼90% over the visible and the NIR range and a resistivity of 7.5 × 10−5 Ω cm. It was also observed that efficiency of the CuInGaSe solar cell devices using the Ga0.04Zn0.96O (50 nm)/In0.024Cd0.976O (30 nm)/Ga0.04Zn0.96O (50 nm) structure as the front electrode shows much higher efficiency (8.5%) than that (4.7%) of the devices with 100 nm Ga0.04Zn0.96O front electrode. This result indicates that the proposed multilayer structure would be a strong candidate for the transparent conducting electrode for the high performance optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Background
Invasion and metastasis of synovial sarcoma is the leading cause of death in patients. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) accelerates tumor cell invasion and metastasis. MiR-9 promotes tumor metastasis by inducing EMT. However, the role of miR-9 in synovial sarcoma is still not clear.
Methods
Overexpression or knockdown of miR-9 in human synovial sarcoma (HSS) cell lines was carried out by miR-9 mimics or miR-9 inhibitors transfection. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were detected using MTS and colony formation assays, flow cytometry, wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was applied to study the interaction between miR-9 and CDH1. Nude mice xenograft model was established, and immunohistochemistry staining assessed Ki-67 level. The related mRNA and protein expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting.
Results
The bioinformatics analyses and luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-9 can target CDH1 3′-UTR. Moreover, miR-9 could induce EMT of HSS cells via targeting CDH1. The negative regulation of miR-9 on CDH1 expression was also confirmed in a mouse xenograft model of synovial sarcoma. Furthermore, miR-9 was observed to induce HSS cell proliferation, migration and invasion and inhibit apoptosis. MAPK/ERK and Wnt/β-catenin signal pathways were activated by the miR-9 overexpression in HSS cells, and then further enhancing tumorigenesis of HSS, which was further confirmed in the mouse model.
Conclusion
MiR-9 induces EMT by targeting CDH1, and activates MAPK/ERK and Wnt/β-catenin signal pathways, thus promoting HSS tumorigenesis.

Abstract: In this contribution, silver nanoparticle (AgNP) across the optimal 1D halloysite nanotube (HNT) hybrid nanostructure is successfully constructed via combining chemical reduction and self-assembly technique and then applied to prepare polyethylene glycol (PEG) based nanocomposite PCM (PEG/HNT@Ag) by a simple vacuum impregnation method. The nanocomposite PCM exhibits desirable phase change temperature of 33.6 °C, relatively high thermal energy storage density of 71.3 J/g, robust thermal reliability with respect to 2000 thermal cycling, as well as significantly enhanced thermal conductivity to 0.9 W/mK. Compared with pure PEG, the thermal conductivity of PEG/HNT@Ag nanocomposite PCM is increased by 2.08 times. Moreover, the nanocomposite PCM shows great improvement in the thermal energy storage/retrieval rates, which is ascribed to the successful construction of multiple thermally conductive pathways comprising a continuous 3D HNT framework decorated with high thermal conductivity AgNP. Therefore, considering the suitable phase change temperature, relatively large latent heat, excellent thermal reliability and enhanced thermal conductivity, the prepared PEG/HNT@Ag as an innovative form-stable nanocomposite PCM has great potential in thermal energy storage and conversion, for instance, as building materials to decrease the indoor temperature fluctuations, improve the indoor thermal comfort and save electric energy.

Abstract: Perovskites based oxides materials with a suitable energy level have been considered as efficient photocatalysts for solar hydrogen generation. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs)-sensitized BiFeO3 (BFO) perovskite heterostructures was synthesized, characterized and tested for hydrogen generation under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation. Au/BFO heterostructures was synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method followed by radiolysis without using any surfactant or strong reducing agent. The shape-dependent photocatalysis revealed that the BFO octahedron (BFO-Oct) exhibited higher hydrogen generation (1.4 mmol h–1 g–1) than the BFO nanosheets (BFO-Ns) (1.1 mmol h–1 g–1) and BFO cylindrical shaped (BFO-Cyl) (0.5 mmol h–1 g–1). After radiolytic construction of the Au/BFO heterostructure, more efficient hydrogen generation was obtained due to the photoinduced electron transfer. The photoresponse of the Au/BFO heterostructures was also assessed in terms of the photocurrent via photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurement which showed Au/BFO-Ns generated higher photocurrents than BFO-Ns by a factor of ∼3.8. The Nyquist plot demonstrated facile charge transfer of BFO-Ns after formation of heterojunction with Au NPs. The Mott–Schottky plot revealed that catalysts are n-type and photo generated charge carrier concentration has been increased for Au/BFO heterostructures (0.92 × 1017 cm−3) compared to pure BFO (0.47 × 1017 cm−3). On the basis of experimental results, the enhanced photocatalytic activities of Au/BFO heterostructures could be ascribed to the significant visible light absorption and the efficient charge carrier separation. This study offers a new route to design noble metal modified perovskites based heterostructure as photocatalysts for water splitting.

Epigenetic demethylation of sFRPs, with emphasis on sFRP4 activation, leading to Wnt signalling suppression and histone modifications in breast, prostate, and ovary cancer stem cells,

Abstract: The expression and levels of secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), important Wnt signalling antagonists, have been reported to be reduced in various cancers, and are associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. During tumour development, all sFRP (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) genes are hypermethylated, causing transcriptional silencing. sFRPs have an ability to sensitize tumour cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, enhancing cell death. Reduced Wnt signalling is associated with loss of cancer stem cell (CSC) viability. We investigated the possible involvement of methylation-mediated silencing of the sFRP gene family in CSCs derived from breast, prostate, and ovarian tumour cell lines. Real-time RT-PCR studies indicated that loss or downregulation of sFRP (1-5) expression in tumours is associated with promoter hypermethylation. Additionally, CSCs derived from all tumour cell lines with sFRP (1-5) promotor hypermethylation expressed sFRP (1-5) mRNA after treatment with 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza), especially sFRP4, implying that DNA methylation is the predominant epigenetic mechanism for sFRP (1-5) silencing. Furthermore, post-translational modification (PTM) in total and histone proteins was observed post 5-Aza and sFRP4 treatment. Protein levels of Wnt downstream signalling components (GSK3β, active β-catenin, and phospho β-catenin) and epigenetic factors of histones (acetyl histone H3, and H3K27me3) affecting PTM were analysed. Our findings suggest that downregulation of sFRP4 expression in endocrine-related cancers can be attributed to aberrant promoter hypermethylation in conjugation with histone modification, and indicate the important role of methylation-induced gene silencing of sFRP4 in survival and proliferation of CSCs derived from these cancers.

Abstract: We investigated the microstructures and their formation mechanisms of carbonate salt based composite phase change materials (CPCMs). Such materials typically consist of a carbonate salt as the phase change material (PCM), a thermal conductivity enhancement material (TCEM) and a ceramic skeleton material (CSM) for structure stabilisation, and are mainly for medium and high temperature thermal energy storage applications. Two carbonate salt based composites were studied with one being eutectic NaLiCO3 and the other Na2CO3. MgO and graphite flakes were used respectively as the CSM and TCEM for fabricating the composite modules. A scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS) was used to observe the microstructures and the salt distribution and redistribution within the composite structures during repeated melting-solidification cycles. The results showed salt migration within the composite structure during the thermal cycling. Such a microscopic motion led to a more homogenous distribution of not only the salt but also the CSM and TCEM. At a low graphite flake loading, breakage of the graphite flake was observed, suggesting stress generation during thermal cycling. The extent of the breakage reduced with increasing graphite flake loading, suggesting the stress generation be related to microscopic motion. The MgO based CSM particles were likely to be sintered, forming a porous structure. Such a structure reduced the swelling effect partially due to the use of graphite on which the salts had a poor wettability.

Abstract: Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are transcribed from the opposite strand of other genes. Most of them are noncoding RNAs. They have been reported to play important roles in a variety of biological processes. In this study, we identified a novel NAT, NATTD, which is partially complementary to both the TIRAP/Mal and DcpS genes. Interestingly, NATTD only positively regulates the expression of DcpS, a decapping scavenger enzyme which is a promising therapeutic target for spinal muscular atrophy. But it has no obvious effects on the expression of TIRAP/Mal gene. The NATTD transcript primarily resides in the nucleus and does not alter the mRNA stability of DcpS. Instead, it is required for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II at the mouse DcpS promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that knocking-down NATTD transcript with shRNA enhanced the H3K27-Me3 modification at the DcpS promoter. In summary, our studies identified NATTD as a regulator of DcpS transcription through epigenetic mechanisms.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) is a clonal hematological malignancy originating from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). HSC are very rare potent cells that reside in the bone marrow (BM) and at a lower level in peripheral blood (PB). Previous studies showed that IM PB CD34+ cells contain not only BM repopulating cells belonging to the malignant clone but also residual normal HSC.
Methods
In the current study, we separated the subpopulations of IM PB CD34+ cells using IL-3Rα/CD123 labeling and further characterized them by genetic and functional analyses.
Results
We differentiated IM PB CD34+ cells into three subpopulations (IL-3Rαhigh, IL-3Rαlow, and IL-3Rαnegative). IL-3Rαhigh CD34+ cell subgroup represents a small population in IM PB CD34+ cells which was not seen in normal G-CSF mobilized CD34+ cells. IM IL-3Rαhigh CD34+ cells contained significant higher percentage of cells bearing marker chromosome detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. In the absence of growth factors, IM IL-3Rαhigh CD34+ cells exhibited abnormal colony forming ability and carried greater percentage of JAK2V617F mutant allele compared with IL-3Rαlow and IL-3Rαnegative CD34+ cells.
Conclusion
These data indicate that IL-3Rαhigh CD34+ cells from IM enriched for the malignant progenitor cells and IL-3Rα/CD123 may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for IM. Our findings will be further validated in future studies with a larger sample size and serial transplant in murine models.

Abstract: An original CsPbIxBr3-x/FAPbIyBr3-y absorber is designed to form C60/CsPbIxBr3-x/FAPbIyBr3-y multi-heterojunction perovskite solar cells with optimized energy band alignment by precisely adjusting I:Br proportion in these two perovskite absorbers. The introduction of CsPbIxBr3-x can not only improve the optical response, but also act as an electron transport conductor to form a band-matched cascade electron extractor with C60. Optimized optical response and well-matched energy levels greatly enhance carrier transport and reduce carrier recombination, affording a high PCE of 17.48%, with high VOC, JSC, FF and excellent device stability simultaneously. Our results shed light on the importance of the interface engineering on the electron excitation and extraction of perovskite layers and describe an innovative approach to further boost the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Intensive research on lead halide perovskites over the last decade led to highly efficient perovskite thin-film photovoltaics. Further enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of this technology is expected from improved light management. In this simulation-based study, nanophotonic perovskite absorber layers are designed in order to enhance the short-circuit current density (JSC) of perovskite solar cells. The enhancement in JSC is beneficial in one of two ways. Firstly, optimized nanophotonic perovskite layers lead to an enhancement in JSC by 5–6% assuming a constant perovskite absorber volume, which correlates to a similar improvement in PCE and annual energy yield (EY). Secondly, optimized nanophotonic perovskite layers can alternatively allow a high JSC to be maintained at reduced perovskite absorber volumes. The latter approach results in about one third of the harmful lead content being mitigated in conventional perovskite solar cells, for an initial perovskite layer thickness of ~300 nm. This study evaluates and analyzes in detail the design of nanophotonic perovskite layers that can be fabricated by nanoimprint lithography. Various design parameters of the nanophotonic perovskite layers such as the period (150–750 nm), the geometrical filling fraction (0.2–0.6) and the depth (0–500 nm) of the nanostructures are studied. A broad optimum to enhance JSC is found for a period of 400 nm. Finally, the angular stability of simulated nanophotonic perovskite solar cells is shown and their excellent light harvesting for realistic irradiation conditions is demonstrated by EY modelling.

Abstract: N-type vapor diffusions in p-GaSb wafers is investigated using the group-VI elements S, Se and Te as diffusion sources. The group-VI elements are found difficult to diffuse in bare p-GaSb wafers because they react with Ga atoms to form compounds, thus hindering the diffusion. Deposition of a SiO layer on the p-GaSb surface is found to be crucial for realizing n-type diffusion. With this SiO coating layer, the concentration of group-VI atoms decreased to a low value limiting the reaction with Ga atoms. Se atoms are found to be good n-type diffusion sources. GaSb thermophotovoltaic cells with n-on-p structures are fabricated using Se diffusion. Compared with a traditional GaSb cell with a p-on-n structure, the cell with the n-on-p structure had a higher quantum efficiency at wavelengths beyond 1000 nm. The output power density was also 1.42 times higher compared to the traditional cell when measured with a 1300 °C - SiN ceramic IR emitter.

Abstract: In this study, wood was delignified, and the capric-palmitic acid eutectic (CA-PA) mixture was impregnated into the delignified wood (DW) to create a stable-form phase change material (DW/CA-PA SFPCM) using a vacuum impregnation method. Subsequently, the properties of the SFPCM were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TG), and hot-disk thermal constant analysis. It was found that the impregnation ratio of the CA-PA mixture into the DW reached 61.2% without leakage. SEM results showed microscale pores generated in the organized cell wall of the DW compared with wood. The pores of DW were filled completely. By contrast, the pores of wood were partially filled. The CA-PA mixture and the DW was physical combination from FTIR result. The SFPCM had a phase-transition temperature of 23.4 °C and high latent heat of 94.4 J g−1. The DW/CA-PA SFPCM had a high thermal stability due to the fact that the working temperature (i.e. sun radiation temperature) was much lower than the decomposition temperature. It also had great thermal reliability. The thermal conductivity of the SFPCM improved significantly by 133.3%. By the above analysis, the SFPCM had superior properties, which make it to be potential material by storing and releasing solar thermal energy in practical applications.

Abstract: Phase change material emulsions (PCMEs) were largely investigated as potential working fluids for various applications as in HVAC systems, solar thermal storage, and heat transfer. They basically contain water and phase change materials, possess much larger energy storage capacity than currently used chilled water based systems and exploit higher thermal conductivity than bulk PCM reservoirs. Main barriers to their application are the difficulty in maintaining emulsion stability and the undercooling effect. In this work, a new solvent-assisted route was developed to produce nano-emulsions of commercial paraffin waxes in water. Concentrations from 2 to 10 wt% were obtained starting from two commercial paraffin waxes, with nominal melting temperatures around 55 °C and 70 °C. The droplet dimensions were verified and resulted below 100 nm for lower concentrations and around 180–220 nm for 10 wt%. The stability of emulsions was verified by long-term tests. An undercooling effect was verified and strongly reduced by testing some nucleating agents (a paraffin melting at 70 °C in the paraffin melting at 55 °C or a carbon nanostructure, single wall carbon nanohorns). The heat of melting was lower than expected, probably due to PCM molecules on the surface of the nanoparticles anchored to the surfactant. However, calculating the thermal capacity of PCMEs with respect to pure water, a gain up to 40% for operating temperatures close to PCM melting temperature was estimated. Optical properties of single wall carbon nanohorns/paraffin composites were also measured.

Abstract: We investigate the use of distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) within triple-junction solar cells (TJSC) for spectrum splitting photovoltaics. An optical model of a lattice-matched (LM) GaInP/GaInAs/Ge TJSC with intermediate DBR is developed, in good agreement with measured reflectance. By modifying the DBR layer number, composition and thickness to broaden the reflectance band, we show that a DBR can provide suitable 900–1050 nm reflectance for spectrum splitting from the LM TJSC to a Si cell, resulting in a more efficient 4-junction receiver. For better practicality and cost effectiveness, we propose that the buffer layers in metamorphic (MM) TJSCs could additionally function as a DBR for spectrum splitting applications. We propose several DBR designs to achieve a suitable spectrum-splitting reflectance band from MM TJSCs to a Si cell, again resulting in a more efficient 4-junction receiver. Finally, we show that our intermediate DBR approach to spectrum splitting has the advantage of a greatly reduced angle-of-incidence dependence compared to a discrete dielectric filter.

Abstract: Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) system efficiency depends mainly on the operating temperature. One of the key components in the CST system is the receiver tube to attain higher temperatures, where the challenge remains on developing a solar absorber coating with high photothermal conversion and thermal stability at high temperatures. Nickel doped cobaltite (NixCo3-xO4; 0 ≤ x ≥ 1) thin film has been developed with spinel oxide phase on top of stainless steel substrates using a simple wet-chemical dip coating method as a base absorber layer (absorptance, α = 0.92; emittance, ε = 0.14). On top of the base absorber layer, coating integrated with silica (SiO2) as an optical enhancement layer (OPEL) has been deposited to make the coating more selective (α = 0.94 and ε = 0.13). A thorough investigation has been done to characterize the samples through UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analyzer for the optical and physiochemical properties. Besides, the optimized spinel coating exhibits a low radiative loss with a minimum thermal emissivity of 0.07 at 100 °C and 0.18 at 500 °C, which indicates that the nickel cobaltite spinels are a very good candidate for high temperature solar selective applications.

Abstract: The efficiency of novel opto-electronic devices e.g. solar cells crucially depends on controlling the doping levels in the device. Decreasing the size of the structure by employing nanowires is attractive for several reasons, for instance reduced material costs, but makes the characterization more challenging. There is still a lack of a precise and simultaneously rapid characterization technique for doping concentrations in nanostructures. In this work axial pn-junctions of GaAs-NWs were investigated electrically, by the utilization of a multi-tip scanning tunneling microscope (MT-STM) as a four point prober. Additionally, these NWs were probed optically at room-temperature by photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy spectroscopy. With both approaches we were able to achieve complementary information of the nanostructure and have developed a complete picture. By using a transport model (for MT-STM) and semi-empirical equations (for PL & CL) which take the Burstein-Moss shift and the band gap narrowing into account, the doping concentrations of the NWs were evaluated and compared. An axial variation in the electron concentration of the n-doped NW-top was resolved as well as a constant hole concentration in the p-doped NW-base. We demonstrate that the combination of both techniques will be necessary to improve the development of a suitable and precise model for the estimation of doping profiles by luminescence data.

Abstract: Yellow Bi2O3/BaCO3 complex pigments were prepared by thermolysis of precursors from the precipitation of Bi2O2CO3 on BaCO3 particles at low temperature between 350 and 410 °C. The synthesized powders were analyzed by colorimetry, UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The pigments were found to have composite phases consisting of β-Bi2O3 and BaCO3. The addition of BaCO3 substantially reduced the consumption of Bi2O3 and maintained comparable or improved color properties and NIR reflectance compared to pure β-Bi2O3. The complex pigments prepared at a 1:1 composition of Bi2O3/BaCO3 exhibited excellent color performance, with L* = 95.63, b* = 79.85, and h° = 90.48 (closed to ideal yellow color, h° = 90), as well as impressive NIR reflectance of up to 96.51%. Finally, an approximately 7.6 °C decrease in temperature was observed for the inner surface of ceramic tiles coated with the cool pigments relative to blank polyurethane coating.

Abstract: Surface engineering of crystalline silicon (c-Si) is the core of Si-based semiconductor devices. The current commercially available c-Si solar cells achieve this by making use of a conventional thin dielectric film passivation system (TDFPS), including SiO2, Al2O3, SiNx:H and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in industry. However, the TDFPS requires high-vacuum and/or high-temperature conditions, which hinders efforts to further reduce the costs of device fabrication. A revolutionized approach to circumvent these issues involves the replacement of TDFPS with new material system which can also achieve high-quality passivation on c-Si surface. Here, we successfully establish and implement a functional group passivation system (FGPS) using a series of functional materials with a sulfonic functional group -SO3H, such as ‘poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid)’ (PAMPS) and ‘polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene, sulfonated, cross-linkable’ (PS-b-PERB), which can achieve a highly effective passivation on Si surface, resulting in power conversion efficiencies up to 20% when they are applied in the front surface engineering of interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells. Furthermore, the FGPS materials inherently allow passivation layer fabrication in low-temperature and high-vacuum-free conditions. This work provides novel low-cost material strategies without compromise of performance for c-Si surface engineering in the future Si-based photovoltaics.

Abstract: In this work, the TiO2 nanoparticles have been used for the fabrication of CdS/TiO2, CdSe/TiO2, ZnS/CdSe/CdS/TiO2, ZnS/CdSe:Cu/CdS/TiO2 and ZnS/CdSe:Mn/CdS/TiO2 quantum dot-sensitized solar cells. The TiO2 films are sensitized with consecutive layers of CdS, CdSe quantum dots. Further, Cu2+ or Mn2+ ions were doped on CdSe quantum dots by successive ion layer adsorption and reaction. The performance of the QDSSCs is examined in detail using polysulfide electrolyte with Cu2S counter electrode. The cells containing CdSe quantum dots doped with the these ions show an improved short circuit current density (∼20.01 mA/cm2) with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.31% under 1 sun illumination. This enhancement is mainly attributed due to the superior light harvesting ability of the CdSe:Cu or CdSe:Mn quantum dots and make large accumulation of photo-injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 nanoparticles. In addition, the combination of doped CdSe and the presence of CdS layers caused lower recombination of photo-injected electrons with the electrolyte. These changes are demonstrated in this studying by using photovoltaic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Abstract: An electroactive small molecule consisting of three triphenylamines and two azomethines was prepared with a pendant oxetane moiety. The electroactive molecule was immobilized on transparent electrodes by photochemically mediated acid catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of the oxetane. Positive and negative patterns of polymer films could also be prepared by copolymerizing the electroactive azomethine monomer with a trioxetane cross-linker. The resulting cross-linked films could be reversibly switched between their neutral and oxidized states with applied electrochemical potentials for upwards of 80 min. The colors of the films switched reversibly between yellow (400 nm) and purple (upwards of 790 nm) when applying an electrochemical potential between ca. 100 mV and 1.1 V vs. Ago, respectively. The thickness of the electroactive film varied between 200 and 1000 nm with a 700 nm film having the optimal electrochromic performance.

Abstract: PH1000/graphene (Gra) composite film with thermally-induced wrinkles has been employed as an electrode in organic solar cells (OSCs) to enhance the device efficiency. The wrinkled PH1000/Gra composite electrode exhibits excellent transmittance of 88.5% at 550 nm, decreased sheet resistance of 147.5 Ω sq−1 and appropriate work function of ~4.9 eV compared to pristine graphene. OSCs with wrinkled composite electrode possess enhanced short circuit current (JSC) compared to that of planar devices due to the wrinkles-induced enhancements in light absorption and charge collection. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs with wrinkled composite electrode is 4.67%, which is 60% or 35% higher than that of planar devices based on the pristine graphene (2.93%) or PH1000 (3.45%) electrode, respectively. Corresponding PCE is comparable to that of the conventional ITO-based OSCs (5.08%). Even better, flexible OSCs with PH1000/Gra composite electrode exhibited excellent mechanical stability compared to ITO device. The enhanced efficiency of the OSCs demonstrates that the wrinkled PH1000/Gra composite electrode is a promising candidate for efficient and flexible optoelectronic application.

Abstract: A precise characterization of thin film silicon in devices is a great challenge for device optimization because the material properties depend on the substrate and change with film thickness. A specific situation is thin poly-Si layer in tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) structure in high-efficiency solar cells. In this paper, we present a systematic study using a wide range UV-Raman spectroscopy to measure the crystalline structure and chemical bonding configurations in the TOPCon structure. Because of the high absorption coefficient of 325-nm laser in silicon films, the Raman probes only the top surface region and minimizes the contribution from c-Si substrate. However, the comparison with the Raman spectra collected with a green laser of 532 nm, the UV-Raman spectrum of a-Si:H shows a very different spectral shape with the disappearance of the LA mode of Si-Si vibration and an appearance of additional signal at 325 cm−1. In addition, the UV-Raman spectrum of the pre-crystallized P doped a-Si:H layer shows most of the vibration modes of Si–Si, Si–H, Si–O–Si and Si–O–H bonds, where the Si–O–H bonds are in the top surface oxide layer. After the crystallization, the Si-Si TO mode shows a high degree of crystallization, the Si-H vibration modes disappear, and an additional Si-O-Si mode is observed which is believed from the ultrathin SiOx passivation layer. In addition, we provide a set of UV-Raman measurements on the samples made with the same layer structure but at different annealing temperatures to show the correlation between the UV-Raman spectra and the passivation quality of the TOPCon structure on the n-type c-Si wafers. These observations prove that UV-Raman spectroscopy is a useful characterization tool for high efficiency c-Si solar cells with TOPCon structure. In addition, the impacts of the material properties on the passivation quality are discussed.

Abstract: In this study, the application of Sb incorporation for low-temperature (≤ 450 °C) processing of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) solar cells is explored. At low reaction temperature, most Ga remains at the back of the film adjacent to the Mo back contact. We observed that the incorporated Sb enhanced grain size and improved device performance compared with similarly processed CIGSe films made without Sb. From the energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis and secondary ion mass spectrometry results, it was determined that elemental Ga accumulation at the back of the reacted film after the two-step selenization process was significantly alleviated owing to Sb incorporation. Significant Sb-induced grain size enhancement was confirmed using cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy. The electronic and optical properties of the Sb incorporated CIGSe films were examined with admittance spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging techniques.

Abstract: Ezrin plays an important role in the development and progression of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), providing a link between the cortical actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane to govern membrane structure and protrusions. However, the mechanism by which ezrin is activated still remains unknown in ESCC. Here, we identify a novel interaction between ezrin and heat shock protein family B (small) member 1 (HSPB1) in ESCC cells by mass spectroscopy and co-immunoprecipitation. HSPB1 only interacts with inactive ezrin and binds to the α-helical coiled coil region of ezrin. Knockdown of HSPB1 resulted to the decline of phosphorylation at ezrin Thr567, markedly suppressing the ability of ezrin to bind to the actin cytoskeleton and migration of ESCC cells. Furthermore, neither the constitutively active phosphomimetic ezrin T567D, nor inactivated ezrin T567A could restore cell migration following HSPB1 knockdown. Low HSPB1 expression was associated with favorable overall survival of ESCC patients. Taken together, HSPB1, as an important partner, participates in the activation of ezrin and merits further evaluation as a novel therapeutic target against human ESCC.

Abstract: We report on the use of a high bandgap metal-oxide at the front interface of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells in a point contact concept for reduced interface recombination. Highly resistive HfO2 is applied on the CIGS surface by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Aspects of the surface passivating effect of HfO2 on CIGS were investigated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), electron beam induced current (EBIC) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. Two structuring methods for point contact formation are compared, a lithographic top-down and a simple bottom-up approach using NaCl as template. The former method employed a plasma etch step which was found to degrade the performance of solar cells when applied on the CIGS surface. The template method omitted sputtering and allowed patterning of HfO2 up to 10 nm thickness without adversely impacting the open-circuit voltage (VOC). EBIC revealed an improved carrier collection due to the HfO2 coating and a long term stable PL decay was observed. Yet, the point contact concept with HfO2 was not significantly influencing the performance of a CIGS solar cell for the investigated parameter range.

Abstract: Selective radiators have received considerable research attention and been extensively applied in many areas, such as thermophotovoltaic systems, infrared cloaking and sensing. Herein, the design of the infrared selective radiator based on ultrathin metallic films was fully demonstrated. From the discussions on the radiative characteristic and growth law of the metallic film, it has been concluded that a continuous ultrathin metallic film can behave as a thermal radiation enhancer. Taking the radiative cooling technology as the application background, a multilayered broadband selective radiator, consisting of an ultrathin Ag film and dielectric Ge films is designed and fabricated. The proposed radiator, which can radiate selectively in the 8–13 µm atmospheric transparency window (ε5–8 μm = 0.21; ε8–13 μm = 0.84; ε13–25 μm = 0.39), achieves an average temperature reduction of 3.5 °C under outdoor conditions and exhibits potential application in radiative cooling technology. Moreover, for our proposed selective radiator, flexible tuning of radiative characteristics can be achieved via structural design, which paves the way for its application in various areas. Unlike the common metamaterial based thermal radiator, our selective radiator with a planar structure is free from the complicated process of lithography or etching and is scalable to realize large-area fabrication and application.

Abstract: Passive sub-ambient daytime radiative cooling has been demonstrated in previous studies by rigorous spectrum-tailored coolers with high solar reflection and strong thermal emission. In this work, a general strategy to change the relative position between the radiative coolers and the sun was proposed to decrease solar radiation reaching the coolers. In this way, passive sub-ambient daytime radiative cooling was well demonstrated on the basis of two commonly available coolers, coolers A and B. Cooler A was fabricated by attaching a 20 μm-thick polydimethylsiloxane film on a reflective metal substrate, and cooler B was a commercial reflective mirror. A field test was conducted for coolers A and B toward north sky in Hefei (117°E, 32°N), China. Results show that the average temperature drops below ambient temperatures of coolers A and B are 3.2 °C and 7.4 °C, respectively, which indicate that the proposed strategy can achieve passive sub-ambient daytime radiative cooling. Furthermore, the feasibility of the proposed strategy for daytime radiative cooling was also proved using a universal thermal model. This work provides a new insight into passive sub-ambient daytime radiative cooling and opens up a new avenue for common materials to potentially achieve sub-ambient daytime radiative cooling.

Abstract: A cover glass integrated with subwavelength structures (SWSs) and quantum dots (QDs) was realized to enhance the spectral response of Cu(In1-xGax)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells. The nanoscale SWSs was produced on the front and backside of cover glass using the self-masked etching method. The fabricated SWSs-integrated glass (SIG) exhibited superior anti-reflective properties over a broad wavelength range and a broad range of incident angle. The average transmittance of the single and double-sided SIG was increased from 92.4% to 95.2% and 97.8% in the wavelength range between 300 and 1200 nm, as compared to that of a flat surface glass. QDs were formed between the fabricated SIG and ZnO layer to act as a luminescent down-shifting (LDS) layer. A large amount of light can pass through the SIG, enhancing the efficiency of the LDS by improving light absorption and lowering reflection. After successful integration of the SIG with QDs (QD/SIG) on top of the CIGS devices, photovoltaic performance was significantly improved. The power conversion efficiency of the CIGS devices integrated with QD/double-sided SIG was improved by 7.41%, compared with that of a reference device (without QD/cover glass). The efficiency improvement is attributed to the enhanced solar energy harvesting by the efficient LDS and the minimized surface reflection loss.

Abstract: Multiple miRNAs have been recognized as critical regulators in osteosarcoma (OS) carcinogenesis. miR-425-5p was demonstrated to be downregulated in the serum of OS patients. However, the detailed roles of miR-425-5p in OS progression and its underlying molecular mechanism are far from being addressed. In our study, the reduced expression of miR-425-5p was observed in OS tissues and cells. Functional analyses showed that miR-425-5p overexpression suppressed OS cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro. Moreover, miR-425-5p upregulation decreased the expressions of MALAT1 and TUG1 in OS cells via directly binding them. miR-425-5p upregulation strikingly abrogated the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway induced by MALAT1 and TUG1 overexpression in OS cells. Finally, we validated that miR-425-5p hindered OS tumor growth, and suppressed MALAT1 and TUG1 expressions and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in vivo. Our findings concluded that miR-425-5p suppressed the tumorigenesis of OS via decreasing MALAT1 and TUG1 expressions through inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, contributing to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of the tumorigenesis of OS.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women across the globe. The major reason for its recurrence and high mortality is due to the presence of a drug refractory and self-renewing population of cells, the cancer stem cells (CSCs). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently emerged as a promising cell-based therapeutic agent for the treatment of different cancer types. However, the anti-tumor effect of MSCs has been indicated to be substantially reduced by their in vivo tumor-trophic migration property and direct cell-to-cell integration with tumor stromal elements. To address this drawback, the present study uses a biomaterial, sodium alginate, for the encapsulation of MSCs from the perinatal tissue, Wharton’s jelly (WJMSCs) into microbeads, to study the effect of WJMSCs beads on breast CSCs derived from two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7. Encapsulation with sodium alginate facilitated the prevention of direct cell-to-cell interaction and these microbeads provided a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment for the encapsulated WJMSCs (eWJMSCs). Compared to two dimensional (2D) culture, eWJMSC increased proliferation of WJMSCs with an increase in pluripotency genes, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune-modulation, and angiogenesis. Interestingly, the tumor invasion suppressor protein E-cadherin was highly expressed in eWJMSCs as shown by Western blot analysis. In addition, eWJMSCs had an increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines VEGF, TGF-β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10 and -6, and IL-3β when compared to 2D culture. Treatment of CSCs with eWJMSCs reduced cell viability, inhibited migration, and exerted an anti-angiogenic effect. eWJMSCs treatment of CSCs increased caspase 3/7 activity, nitric oxide production, and reactive oxygen species production, suggesting its anti-tumorigenic activity. Gene expression analysis revealed that CSCs treated with eWJMSCs had a downregulation of pro-proliferation markers, drug transporters, epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated markers, and angiogenesis related genes. The mode of anti-proliferative action of WJMSCs beads was possibly through inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as indicated by the upregulation of the Wnt antagonists sFRP4 and DKK1. These data suggest that alginate-encapsulated WJMSCs could be an efficient cell contact-free system for developing stem cell-based therapies for CSCs.
