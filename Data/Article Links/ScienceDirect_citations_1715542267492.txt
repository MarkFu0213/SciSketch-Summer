Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) comprise a heterogeneous population exhibiting self-renewal and differentiation capabilities; however, the mechanisms involved in maintaining this heterogeneity remain unclear. Here, we show that SATB1 is involved in regulating HSC heterogeneity. Results in conditional Satb1-knockout mice revealed that SATB1 was important for the self-renewal and lymphopoiesis of adult HSCs. Additionally, HSCs from Satb1/Tomato-knockin reporter mice were classified based on SATB1/Tomato intensity, with transplantation experiments revealing stronger differentiation toward the lymphocytic lineage along with high SATB1 levels, whereas SATB1− HSCs followed the myeloid lineage in agreement with genome-wide transcription and cell culture studies. Importantly, SATB1− and SATB1+ HSC populations were interconvertible upon transplantation, with SATB1+ HSCs showing higher reconstituting and lymphopoietic potentials in primary recipients relative to SATB1− HSCs, whereas both HSCs exhibited equally efficient reconstituted lympho-hematopoiesis in secondary recipients. These results suggest that SATB1 levels regulate the maintenance of HSC multipotency, with variations contributing to HSC heterogeneity.

Abstract: The focus of this special issue (SI) »Membrane Merger in Conventional and Unconventional Vesicle Secretion« is regulated exocytosis, a universally conserved mechanism, consisting of a merger between the vesicle and the plasma membranes. Although this process evolved with eukaryotic organisms some three billion years ago (Spang et al., 2015), the understanding of physiology and patobiology of this process, especially at elementary vesicle level, remains unclear. Exocytotic fusion consists of several stages, starting by vesicle delivery to the plasma membrane, initially establishing a very narrow and stable fusion pore, that can reversibly open and close several times before it can fully widen. This allows vesicle cargo to be completely discharged from the vesicle lumen and permits vesicle-membrane resident proteins including channels, transporters, receptors and other signalling molecules, to be incorporated into the plasma membrane. The contributions in this SI bring new insights on the complexity of vesicle–based secretion, including discussion that vesicle anatomy appears to modulate exocytotic fusion pore properties and that the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor proteins (SNARE-proteins), not only facilitate pre- and post-fusion stages of exocytosis, but also serve in vesicle navigation within the cytoplasm.

Abstract: Summary
EphB2 is involved in enhancing synaptic transmission and gene expression. To explore the roles of EphB2 in memory formation and enhancement, we used a photoactivatable EphB2 (optoEphB2) to activate EphB2 forward signaling in pyramidal neurons in lateral amygdala (LA). Photoactivation of optoEphB2 during fear conditioning, but not minutes afterward, enhanced long-term, but not short-term, auditory fear conditioning. Photoactivation of optoEphB2 during fear conditioning led to activation of the cAMP/Ca2+ responsive element binding (CREB) protein. Application of light to a kinase-dead optoEphB2 in LA did not lead to enhancement of long-term fear conditioning memory or to activation of CREB. Long-term, but not short-term, auditory fear conditioning memory was impaired in mice lacking EphB2 forward signaling (EphB2lacZ/lacZ). Activation of optoEphB2 in LA of EphB2lacZ/lacZ mice enhanced long-term fear conditioning memory. The present findings show that the level of EphB2 forward signaling activity during learning determines the strength of long-term memory consolidation.

Abstract: Summary
Animals require an immediate response to oxygen availability to allow rapid shifts between oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. These metabolic shifts are highly regulated by the HIF transcription factor. The factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) is an asparaginyl hydroxylase that controls HIF transcriptional activity in an oxygen-dependent manner. We show here that FIH loss increases oxidative metabolism, while also increasing glycolytic capacity, and that this gives rise to an increase in oxygen consumption. We further show that the loss of FIH acts to accelerate the cellular metabolic response to hypoxia. Skeletal muscle expresses 50-fold higher levels of FIH than other tissues: we analyzed skeletal muscle FIH mutants and found a decreased metabolic efficiency, correlated with an increased oxidative rate and an increased rate of hypoxic response. We find that FIH, through its regulation of oxidation, acts in concert with the PHD/vHL pathway to accelerate HIF-mediated metabolic responses to hypoxia.

Abstract: Fine structural features of Mizuhopecten yessoensis in different embryonic and larval developmental stages from oocyte to early veliger have been studied. Spermatozoa have a conical head, consisting of a short acrosome, nucleus, and 4 mitochondria in the middle piece. The flagellum is approximately 40 μm in length. Oocyte cytoplasm contains numerous yolk granules, which are gradually expended during the larval development and disappear at the early veliger stage. Gastrula has two invaginations: shell gland anlage on the dorsal side and ventral side archenteron. Prototroch of a trochophore consists of two ciliary rings. Telotroch is absent. Myoblasts containing bundles of myofilaments are found in the blastocoel of trochophore. Velum and shell begin forming at the late trochophore stage. Cells of gut epithelium form numerous microvilli, organized into a brush border structure on the surface of enterocytes. A suggestion is made that larvae at the late trochophore stage are capable of digesting food and feeding. The structure of a M. yessoensis veliger is typical for pectinids. The velar retractor muscles have cross striation with a period of 1 μm. The digestive system of an 8-day-old veliger consists of the esophagus, stomach (with subdivided gastric shield and style sac), and short intestine. The digestive gland (with no discernible loops at this stage) is a part of the stomach epithelium with two types of digestive enzyme-producing cells.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is identified as a signaling adaptor protein that regulates bone metabolism, immunity, and the development of several tissues. Therefore, its functions are closely associated with multiple diseases. TRAF6 is also involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis under steady-state conditions, but the role of TRAF6 in modulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) during the developmental stages remains unknown. Here, we report that the deletion of TRAF6 in hematopoietic lineage cells resulted in the upregulation of HSPCs in the fetal liver at the prenatal period. However, in the early postnatal period, deletion of TRAF6 drastically diminished HSPCs in the bone marrow (BM), with severe defects in BM development and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen being identified. In the analysis of adult HSPCs in a BM reconstitution setting, TRAF6 played no significant role in HSPC homeostasis, albeit it affected the development of T cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the role of TRAF6 in regulating HSPCs is altered in a spatial and temporal manner during the developmental course of mice.

Sam50 Regulates PINK1-Parkin-Mediated Mitophagy by Controlling PINK1 Stability and Mitochondrial Morphology,

Abstract: Summary
PINK1 and Parkin mediate mitophagy, the cellular process that clears dysfunctional mitochondria. Mitophagy is regulated by mitochondrial dynamics, but the molecules linking these two processes remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Sam50, the core component of the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM), is a critical regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy. In response to Sam50 depletion, normal tubular mitochondria are first fragmented and subsequently merged into large spheres. Sam50 interacts with PINK1 to facilitate its processing and degradation. Depletion of Sam50 results in PINK1 accumulation, Parkin recruitment, and mitophagy. Interestingly, Sam50 deficiency induces a piecemeal mode of mitophagy that eliminates mitochondria “bit by bit” but spares mtDNA. In C. elegans, the Sam50 homolog gop-3 is required for the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and mass. Our findings reveal that Sam50 directly links mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy and that Sam50 depletion induces elimination of mitochondria without affecting mtDNA content.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways modulate cancer risk, progression, and therapeutic response. We systematically analyzed somatic alterations to provide a comprehensive view of DDR deficiency across 33 cancer types. Mutations with accompanying loss of heterozygosity were observed in over 1/3 of DDR genes, including TP53 and BRCA1/2. Other prevalent alterations included epigenetic silencing of the direct repair genes EXO5, MGMT, and ALKBH3 in ∼20% of samples. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) was present at varying frequency in many cancer types, most notably ovarian cancer. However, in contrast to ovarian cancer, HRD was associated with worse outcomes in several other cancers. Protein structure-based analyses allowed us to predict functional consequences of rare, recurrent DDR mutations. A new machine-learning-based classifier developed from gene expression data allowed us to identify alterations that phenocopy deleterious TP53 mutations. These frequent DDR gene alterations in many human cancers have functional consequences that may determine cancer progression and guide therapy.

Abstract: Summary
While therapeutic modulation of miRNAs provides a promising approach for numerous diseases, the promiscuous nature of miRNAs raises concern over detrimental off-target effects. miR-33 has emerged as a likely target for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, the deleterious effects of long-term anti-miR-33 therapies and predisposition of miR-33−/− mice to obesity and metabolic dysfunction exemplify the possible pitfalls of miRNA-based therapies. Our work provides an in-depth characterization of miR-33−/− mice and explores the mechanisms by which loss of miR-33 promotes insulin resistance in key metabolic tissues. Contrary to previous reports, our data do not support a direct role for SREBP-1-mediated lipid synthesis in promoting these effects. Alternatively, in adipose tissue of miR-33−/− mice, we observe increased pre-adipocyte proliferation, enhanced lipid uptake, and impaired lipolysis. Moreover, we demonstrate that the driving force behind these abnormalities is increased food intake, which can be prevented by pair feeding with wild-type animals.

Abstract: Summary
Transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into induced neuronal cells (iNs) by the neuron-specific transcription factors Brn2, Myt1l, and Ascl1 is a paradigmatic example of inter-lineage conversion across epigenetically distant cells. Despite tremendous progress regarding the transcriptional hierarchy underlying transdifferentiation, the enablers of the concomitant epigenome resetting remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of KMT2A and KMT2B, two histone H3 lysine 4 methylases with cardinal roles in development, through individual and combined inactivation. We found that Kmt2b, whose human homolog’s mutations cause dystonia, is selectively required for iN conversion through suppression of the alternative myocyte program and induction of neuronal maturation genes. The identification of KMT2B-vulnerable targets allowed us, in turn, to expose, in a cohort of 225 patients, 45 unique variants in 39 KMT2B targets, which represent promising candidates to dissect the molecular bases of dystonia.

Abstract: Summary
Cell survival to replication stress depends on the activation of the Mec1ATR-Rad53 checkpoint response that protects the integrity of stalled forks and controls the origin firing program. Here we found that Mad2, a member of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), contributes to efficient origin firing and to cell survival in response to replication stress. We show that Rad53 and Mad2 promote S-phase cyclin expression through different mechanisms: while Rad53 influences Clb5,6 degradation, Mad2 promotes their protein synthesis. We found that Mad2 co-sediments with polysomes and modulates the association of the translation inhibitor Caf204E-BP with the translation machinery and the initiation factor eIF4E. This Mad2-dependent translational regulatory process does not depend on other SAC proteins. Altogether our observations indicate that Mad2 has an additional function outside of mitosis to control DNA synthesis and collaborates with the Mec1-Rad53 regulatory axis to allow cell survival in response to replication stress.

A Novel Reciprocal Crosstalk between RNF168 and PARP1 to Regulate DNA Repair Processes,

Abstract: Emerging evidence has suggested that cellular crosstalk between RNF168 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) contributes to the precise control of the DNA damage response (DDR). However, the direct and reciprocal functional link between them remains unclear. In this report, we identified that RNF168 ubiquitinates PARP1 via direct interaction and accelerates PARP1 degradation in the presence of poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains, metabolites of activated PARP1. Through mass spectrometric analysis, we revealed that RNF168 ubiquitinated multiple lysine residues on PARP1 via K48-linked ubiquitin chain formation. Consistent with this, micro-irradiation-induced PARP1 accumulation at damaged chromatin was significantly increased by knockdown of endogenous RNF168. In addition, it was confirmed that abnormal changes of HR and HNEJ due to knockdown of RNF168 were restored by overexpression of WT RNF168 but not by reintroduction of mutants lacking E3 ligase activity or PAR binding ability. The comet assay also revealed that both PAR-binding and ubiquitin-conjugation activities are indispensable for the RNF168-mediated DNA repair process. Taken together, our results suggest that RNF168 acts as a counterpart of PARP1 in DDR and regulates the HR/NHEJ repair processes through the ubiquitination of PARP1.

Abstract: Summary
The expression levels of SLC or ABC membrane transporter transcripts typically differ 100- to 10,000-fold between different tissues. The Gini coefficient characterizes such inequalities and here is used to describe the distribution of the expression of each transporter among different human tissues and cell lines. Many transporters exhibit extremely high Gini coefficients even for common substrates, indicating considerable specialization consistent with divergent evolution. The expression profiles of SLC transporters in different cell lines behave similarly, although Gini coefficients for ABC transporters tend to be larger in cell lines than in tissues, implying selection. Transporter genes are significantly more heterogeneously expressed than the members of most non-transporter gene classes. Transcripts with the stablest expression have a low Gini index and often differ significantly from the “housekeeping” genes commonly used for normalization in transcriptomics/qPCR studies. PCBP1 has a low Gini coefficient, is reasonably expressed, and is an excellent novel reference gene. The approach, referred to as GeneGini, provides rapid and simple characterization of expression-profile distributions and improved normalization of genome-wide expression-profiling data.

Abstract: Summary
Combination immune checkpoint blockade has demonstrated promising benefit in lung cancer, but predictors of response to combination therapy are unknown. Using whole-exome sequencing to examine non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with PD-1 plus CTLA-4 blockade, we found that high tumor mutation burden (TMB) predicted improved objective response, durable benefit, and progression-free survival. TMB was independent of PD-L1 expression and the strongest feature associated with efficacy in multivariable analysis. The low response rate in TMB low NSCLCs demonstrates that combination immunotherapy does not overcome the negative predictive impact of low TMB. This study demonstrates the association between TMB and benefit to combination immunotherapy in NSCLC. TMB should be incorporated in future trials examining PD-(L)1 with CTLA-4 blockade in NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
The HERBY trial was a phase II open-label, randomized, multicenter trial evaluating bevacizumab (BEV) in addition to temozolomide/radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed non-brainstem high-grade glioma (HGG) between the ages of 3 and 18 years. We carried out comprehensive molecular analysis integrated with pathology, radiology, and immune profiling. In post-hoc subgroup analysis, hypermutator tumors (mismatch repair deficiency and somatic POLE/POLD1 mutations) and those biologically resembling pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma ([PXA]-like, driven by BRAF_V600E or NF1 mutation) had significantly more CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and longer survival with the addition of BEV. Histone H3 subgroups (hemispheric G34R/V and midline K27M) had a worse outcome and were immune cold. Future clinical trials will need to take into account the diversity represented by the term “HGG” in the pediatric population.

Abstract: Summary
Spt6 is a conserved factor that controls transcription and chromatin structure across the genome. Although Spt6 is viewed as an elongation factor, spt6 mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae allow elevated levels of transcripts from within coding regions, suggesting that Spt6 also controls initiation. To address the requirements for Spt6 in transcription and chromatin structure, we have combined four genome-wide approaches. Our results demonstrate that Spt6 represses transcription initiation at thousands of intragenic promoters. We characterize these intragenic promoters and find sequence features conserved with genic promoters. Finally, we show that Spt6 also regulates transcription initiation at most genic promoters and propose a model of initiation site competition to account for this. Together, our results demonstrate that Spt6 controls the fidelity of transcription initiation throughout the genome.

Abstract: Summary
Successful anti-viral response requires the sustained activation and expansion of CD8+ T cells for periods that far exceed the time limit of physical T cell interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The expanding CD8+ T cell pool generates the effector and memory cell populations that provide viral clearance and long-term immunity, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that 3BP2 is recruited in cytoplasmic microclusters and nucleates a signaling complex that facilitates MHC:peptide-independent activation of signaling pathways downstream of the TCR. We show that induction of the adaptor molecule 3BP2 is a sensor of TCR signal strength and is critical for sustaining CD8+ T cell proliferation and regulating effector and memory differentiation.

Globular Adiponectin Exerts a Pro-Inflammatory Effect via IκB/NF-κB Pathway Activation and Anti-Inflammatory Effect by IRAK-1 Downregulation,

Abstract: Adiponectin, a hormone produced by adipose tissue, is very abundant in plasma, and its anti- and pro-inflammatory effects are reported. However, the mechanisms of these pro- and anti-inflammatory effects are not fully defined. Herein, we evaluated the dual inflammatory response mechanism of adiponectin in macrophages. Short-term globular adiponectin (gAd) treatment induced IκBα degradation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and TNF-α production in RAW 264.7 cells. Polymyxin B pretreatment did not block gAd-induced IκBα degradation, and heated gAd was unable to degrade IκBα, suggesting that the effects of gAd were not due to endotoxin contamination. gAd activated IKK and Akt, and inhibition of either IKK or Akt by dominant-negative IKKβ (DN-IKKβ) or DN-Akt overexpression blocked gAd-induced IκBα degradation, suggesting that short-term incubation with gAd mediates inflammatory responses by activating the IκB/NF-κB and PI3K/Akt pathways. Contrastingly, long-term stimulation with gAd induced, upon subsequent stimulation, tolerance to gAd, lipopolysaccharide, and CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide, which is associated with gAd-induced downregulation of IL-receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) due to IRAK-1 transcriptional repression. Conclusively, our findings demonstrate that the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to gAd in innate immune cells are time-dependent, and mediated by the activation of the IκB/NF-κB pathway, and IRAK-1 downregulation, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Ants are an emerging model system for neuroepigenetics, as embryos with virtually identical genomes develop into different adult castes that display diverse physiology, morphology, and behavior. Although a number of ant genomes have been sequenced to date, their draft quality is an obstacle to sophisticated analyses of epigenetic gene regulation. We reassembled de novo high-quality genomes for two ant species, Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator. Using long reads enabled us to span large repetitive regions and improve genome contiguity, leading to comprehensive and accurate protein-coding annotations that facilitated the identification of a Gp-9-like gene as differentially expressed in Harpegnathos castes. The new assemblies also enabled us to annotate long non-coding RNAs in ants, revealing caste-, brain-, and developmental-stage-specific long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in Harpegnathos. These upgraded genomes, along with the new gene annotations, will aid future efforts to identify epigenetic mechanisms of phenotypic and behavioral plasticity in ants.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated circulating fatty acids (FAs) contribute to obesity-associated metabolic complications, but the mechanisms by which insulin suppresses lipolysis are poorly understood. We show that α/β-hydrolase domain-containing 15 (ABHD15) is required for the anti-lipolytic action of insulin in white adipose tissue (WAT). Neither insulin nor glucose treatments can suppress FA mobilization in global and conditional Abhd15-knockout (KO) mice. Accordingly, insulin signaling is impaired in Abhd15-KO adipocytes, as indicated by reduced AKT phosphorylation, glucose uptake, and de novo lipogenesis. In vitro data reveal that ABHD15 associates with and stabilizes phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B). Accordingly, PDE3B expression is decreased in the WAT of Abhd15-KO mice, mechanistically explaining increased protein kinase A (PKA) activity, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation, and undiminished FA release upon insulin signaling. Ultimately, Abhd15-KO mice develop insulin resistance. Notably, ABHD15 expression is decreased in humans with obesity and diabetes compared to humans with obesity and normal glucose tolerance, identifying ABHD15 as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful DNA replication is challenged by stalling of replication forks during S phase. Replication stress is further increased in cancer cells or in response to genotoxic insults. Using live single-cell image analysis, we found that CDK2 activity fluctuates throughout an unperturbed S phase. We show that CDK2 fluctuations result from transient ATR signals triggered by stochastic replication stress events. In turn, fluctuating endogenous CDK2 activity causes corresponding decreases and increases in DNA synthesis rates, linking changes in stochastic replication stress to fluctuating global DNA replication rates throughout S phase. Moreover, cells that re-enter the cell cycle after mitogen stimulation have increased CDK2 fluctuations and prolonged S phase resulting from increased replication stress-induced CDK2 suppression. Thus, our study reveals a dynamic control principle for DNA replication whereby CDK2 activity is suppressed and fluctuates throughout S phase to continually adjust global DNA synthesis rates in response to recurring stochastic replication stress events.

Abstract: Summary
We characterized the epigenetic landscape of genes encoding long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) across 6,475 tumors and 455 cancer cell lines. In stark contrast to the CpG island hypermethylation phenotype in cancer, we observed a recurrent hypomethylation of 1,006 lncRNA genes in cancer, including EPIC1 (epigenetically-induced lncRNA1). Overexpression of EPIC1 is associated with poor prognosis in luminal B breast cancer patients and enhances tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, EPIC1 promotes cell-cycle progression by interacting with MYC through EPIC1's 129–283 nt region. EPIC1 knockdown reduces the occupancy of MYC to its target genes (e.g., CDKN1A, CCNA2, CDC20, and CDC45). MYC depletion abolishes EPIC1's regulation of MYC target and luminal breast cancer tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The functional diversity of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), with its countless substrates, relies on the ordered assembly of alternative PP1 holoenzymes. Here, we show that newly synthesized PP1 is first held by its partners SDS22 and inhibitor-3 (I3) in an inactive complex, which needs to be disassembled by the p97 AAA-ATPase to promote exchange to substrate specifiers. Unlike p97-mediated degradative processes that require the Ufd1-Npl4 ubiquitin adapters, p97 is targeted to PP1 by p37 and related adapter proteins. Reconstitution with purified components revealed direct interaction of the p37 SEP domain with I3 without the need for ubiquitination, and ATP-driven pulling of I3 into the central channel of the p97 hexamer, which triggers dissociation of I3 and SDS22. Thus, we establish regulatory ubiquitin-independent protein complex disassembly as part of the functional arsenal of p97 and define an unanticipated essential step in PP1 biogenesis that illustrates the molecular challenges of ordered subunit exchange.

Abstract: Summary
The murine cytomegalovirus immunoevasin m152/gp40 binds major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and retains them in the early secretory pathway by a previously unknown mechanism, preventing antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells. We show that retention of class I and of gp40 itself depends on a lumenal linker sequence in gp40. With unbiased co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we find that, through this linker, gp40 binds to TMED10/Tmp21/p24δ1, a member of the p24 family of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi transmembrane proteins. We show that the C-terminal KKxxx Golgi-to-ER retrieval signal of TMED10 is required for gp40-mediated retention of class I. We thus identify a viral interaction partner of the p24 proteins and their exploitation for viral immune evasion.

Abstract: Summary
Alcohol and ketogenic diets increase water consumption. Here, we show that the hormone FGF21 is required for this drinking response in mice. Circulating levels of FGF21 are increased by alcohol consumption in humans and by both alcohol and ketogenic diets in mice. Pharmacologic administration of FGF21 stimulates water drinking behavior in mice within 2 hr. Concordantly, mice lacking FGF21 fail to increase water intake in response to either alcohol or a ketogenic diet. The effect of FGF21 on drinking is mediated in part by SIM1-positive neurons of the hypothalamus and is inhibited by β-adrenergic receptor antagonists. Given that FGF21 also is known to suppress alcohol intake in favor of pure water, this work identifies FGF21 as a fundamental neurotropic hormone that governs water balance in response to specific nutrient stresses that can cause dehydration.

Abstract: Summary
Complementing long-standing traditions centered on histology, fMRI approaches are rapidly maturing in delineating brain areal organization at the macroscale. The non-human primate (NHP) provides the opportunity to overcome critical barriers in translational research. Here, we establish the data requirements for achieving reproducible and internally valid parcellations in individuals. We demonstrate that functional boundaries serve as a functional fingerprint of the individual animals and can be achieved under anesthesia or awake conditions (rest, naturalistic viewing), though differences between awake and anesthetized states precluded the detection of individual differences across states. Comparison of awake and anesthetized states suggested a more nuanced picture of changes in connectivity for higher-order association areas, as well as visual and motor cortex. These results establish feasibility and data requirements for the generation of reproducible individual-specific parcellations in NHPs, provide insights into the impact of scan state, and motivate efforts toward harmonizing protocols.

Abstract: LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) contain an N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD). Typically, LTTRs function as homotetramers. VV2_1132 was identified in Vibrio vulnificus as an LTTR that is a homologue of HypT (also known as YjiE or QseD) in Escherichia coli. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of full-length VV2_1132 at a resolution of 2.2 Å, thereby revealing a novel combination of the domains in the tetrameric assembly. Only one DBD dimer in the tetramer can bind to DNA, because the DNA binding motifs of the other DBD dimer are completely buried in the tetrameric assembly. Structural and functional analyses of VV2_1132 suggest that it might not perform the same role as E. coli HypT, indicating that further study is required to elucidate the function of this gene in V. vulnificus. The unique structure of VV2_1132 extends our knowledge of LTTR function and mechanisms of action.

Abstract: Summary
To identify novel targets for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening using AML cell lines, followed by a second screen in vivo. Here, we show that the mRNA decapping enzyme scavenger (DCPS) gene is essential for AML cell survival. The DCPS enzyme interacted with components of pre-mRNA metabolic pathways, including spliceosomes, as revealed by mass spectrometry. RG3039, a DCPS inhibitor originally developed to treat spinal muscular atrophy, exhibited anti-leukemic activity via inducing pre-mRNA mis-splicing. Humans harboring germline biallelic DCPS loss-of-function mutations do not exhibit aberrant hematologic phenotypes, indicating that DCPS is dispensable for human hematopoiesis. Our findings shed light on a pre-mRNA metabolic pathway and identify DCPS as a target for AML therapy.

Abstract: Summary
How intracellular pathogens acquire essential non-diffusible host metabolites and whether the host cell counteracts the siphoning of these nutrients by its invaders are open questions. Here we show that host mitochondria fuse during infection by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii to limit its uptake of fatty acids (FAs). A combination of genetics and imaging of FA trafficking indicates that Toxoplasma infection triggers lipophagy, the autophagy of host lipid droplets (LDs), to secure cellular FAs essential for its proliferation. Indeed, Toxoplasma FA siphoning and growth are reduced in host cells genetically deficient for autophagy or triglyceride depots. Conversely, Toxoplasma FA uptake and proliferation are increased in host cells lacking mitochondrial fusion, required for efficient mitochondrial FA oxidation, or where mitochondrial FA oxidation is pharmacologically inhibited. Thus, mitochondrial fusion can be regarded as a cellular defense mechanism against intracellular parasites, by limiting Toxoplasma access to host nutrients liberated by lipophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are well known to play a critical role in maintaining brain homeostasis. However, their role in epileptogenesis has yet to be determined. Here, we demonstrate that elevated mTOR signaling in mouse microglia leads to phenotypic changes, including an amoeboid-like morphology, increased proliferation, and robust phagocytosis activity, but without a significant induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We further provide evidence that these noninflammatory changes in microglia disrupt homeostasis of the CNS, leading to reduced synapse density, marked microglial infiltration into hippocampal pyramidal layers, moderate neuronal degeneration, and massive proliferation of astrocytes. Moreover, the mice thus affected develop severe early-onset spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs). Therefore, we have revealed an epileptogenic mechanism that is independent of the microglial inflammatory response. Our data suggest that microglia could be an opportune target for epilepsy prevention.

Abstract: Summary
Base editors (BEs) are emerging tools used for precision correction or diversifying mutation. It provides a potential way to recreate somatic hypermutations (SHM) for generating high-affinity antibody, which is usually screened from antigen-challenged animal models or synthetic combinatorial libraries. By comparing somatic mutations in the same genomic context, we screened engineered deaminases and CRISPR-deaminase coupling approaches and updated diversifying base editors (DBEs) to generate SHM. The deaminase used in DBEs retains its intrinsic nucleotide preference and mutates cytidines at its preferred motifs. DBE with AID targets the same hotspots as physiological AID does in vivo, while DBE with other deaminases generates distinct mutation profiles from the same DNA substrate. Downstream DNA repair pathways further diversified the sequence, while Cas9-nickase restricted mutation spreading. Finally, application of DBE in an antibody display system achieved antibody affinity maturation ex vivo. Our findings provide insight of DBE working mechanism and an alternative antibody engineering approach.

Abstract: Summary
Nitric oxide (NO) plays an established role in numerous physiological and pathological processes, but the specific cellular sources of NO in disease pathogenesis remain unclear, preventing the implementation of NO-related therapy. Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) is the only enzyme able to produce arginine, the substrate for NO generation by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms. Here, we generated cell-specific conditional ASL knockout mice in combination with genetic and chemical colitis models. We demonstrate that NO derived from enterocytes alleviates colitis by decreasing macrophage infiltration and tissue damage, whereas immune cell-derived NO is associated with macrophage activation, resulting in increased severity of inflammation. We find that induction of endogenous NO production by enterocytes with supplements that upregulate ASL expression and complement its substrates results in improved epithelial integrity and alleviation of colitis and of inflammation-associated colon cancer.

Abstract: The spatial organisation of Orai channels and SERCA pumps within ER-PM junctions is important for enhancing the versatility and specificity of sub-cellular Ca2+ signals generated during store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). In this paper, we present a novel three dimensional spatio-temporal model describing Ca2+ dynamics in the ER-PM junction and sub-PM ER during SOCE. We investigate the role of Orai channel and SERCA pump location to provide insights into how these components shape the Ca2+ signals generated and affect ER refilling. We find that the organisation of Orai channels within the ER-PM junction controls the amplitude and shape of the Ca2+ profile but does not enhance ER refilling. The model shows that ER refilling is only weakly affected by the location of SERCA2b pumps within the ER-PM junction and that the placement of SERCA2a pumps within the ER-PM junction has much greater control over ER refilling.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a critical pathway that degrades intracytoplasmic contents by engulfing them in double-membraned autophagosomes that are conjugated with LC3 family members. These membranes are specified by phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), which recruits WIPI2, which, in turn, recruits ATG16L1 to specify the sites of LC3-conjugation. Conventionally, phosphatidylinositides act in concert with other proteins in targeting effectors to specific membranes. Here we describe that WIPI2 localizes to autophagic precursor membranes by binding RAB11A, a protein that specifies recycling endosomes, and that PI3P is formed on RAB11A-positive membranes upon starvation. Loss of RAB11A impairs the recruitment and assembly of the autophagic machinery. RAB11A-positive membranes are a primary direct platform for canonical autophagosome formation that enables autophagy of the transferrin receptor and damaged mitochondria. While this compartment may receive membrane inputs from other sources to enable autophagosome biogenesis, RAB11A-positive membranes appear to be a compartment from which autophagosomes evolve.

Abstract: Human fallopian tube fimbria secretory epithelial cells (hFTSECs) are considered an origin of ovarian cancer and methods for their culture from fallopian tube specimens have been reported. Our objective was to determine whether characteristics of the donors or surgeries were associated with the capacities of fimbria specimens to generate hFTSEC cultures or their immune profiles. There were no surgical complications attributable to fallopian tube removal. Attempts to establish primary hFTSEC cultures were successful in 37 of 55 specimens (67%). Success rates did not differ significantly between specimens grouped by patient or surgery characteristics. Established cultures could be revived after cryopreservation and none became contaminated with microorganisms. Two cultures evaluated for long term growth senesced between passages 10 and 15. M1 macrophages were the predominant cell type, while all other immune cells were present at much lower percentages. IL-10 and TGF-β exhibited opposing trends with M1 and M2 macrophages. Plasma IL-10 levels exhibited significant positive correlation with patient age. In conclusion, fallopian tube fimbria specimens exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype and can be used to provide a source of hFTSECs that can be cultured for a limited time regardless of the donor patient age or race, or the type of surgery performed.

Abstract: Summary
Synovial sarcoma (SS) is defined by the hallmark SS18-SSX fusion oncoprotein, which renders BAF complexes aberrant in two manners: gain of SSX to the SS18 subunit and concomitant loss of BAF47 subunit assembly. Here we demonstrate that SS18-SSX globally hijacks BAF complexes on chromatin to activate an SS transcriptional signature that we define using primary tumors and cell lines. Specifically, SS18-SSX retargets BAF complexes from enhancers to broad polycomb domains to oppose PRC2-mediated repression and activate bivalent genes. Upon suppression of SS18-SSX, reassembly of BAF47 restores enhancer activation, but is not required for proliferative arrest. These results establish a global hijacking mechanism for SS18-SSX on chromatin, and define the distinct contributions of two concurrent BAF complex perturbations.

Abstract: Summary
The assembly of ribosomal subunits is an essential prerequisite for protein biosynthesis in all domains of life. Although biochemical and biophysical approaches have advanced our understanding of ribosome assembly, our mechanistic comprehension of this process is still limited. Here, we perform an in vitro reconstitution of the Escherichia coli 50S ribosomal subunit. Late reconstitution products were subjected to high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy and multiparticle refinement analysis to reconstruct five distinct precursors of the 50S subunit with 4.3–3.8 Å resolution. These assembly intermediates define a progressive maturation pathway culminating in a late assembly particle, whose structure is more than 96% identical to a mature 50S subunit. Our structures monitor the formation and stabilization of structural elements in a nascent particle in unprecedented detail and identify the maturation of the rRNA-based peptidyl transferase center as the final critical step along the 50S assembly pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Graded Shh signaling across fields of precursor cells coordinates patterns of gene expression, differentiation, and morphogenetic behavior as precursors form complex structures, such as the nervous system, the limbs, and craniofacial skeleton. Here we discover that intracellular calcium mobilization, a process tightly controlled and readily modulated, regulates the level of Shh-dependent gene expression in responding cells and affects the development of all Shh-dependent cell types in the zebrafish embryo. Reduced expression or modified activity of ryanodine receptor (RyR) intracellular calcium release channels shifted the allocation of Shh-dependent cell fates in the somitic muscle and neural tube. Mosaic analysis revealed that RyR-mediated calcium mobilization is required specifically in Shh ligand-receiving cells. This work reveals that RyR channels participate in intercellular signal transduction events. As modulation of RyR activity modifies tissue patterning, we hypothesize that alterations in intracellular calcium mobilization contribute to both birth defects and evolutionary modifications of morphology.

Abstract: Hyposalivation because of curative radiation therapy in patients with head and neck cancer is a major concern. At present, there is no effective treatment for hyposalivation, highlighting the importance of cell therapy as a new therapeutic approach. To provide functional cells for cell replacement therapy, it is important to overcome the limitations of current in vitro culture methods for isolated salivary gland cells. Here, we suggest an improved culture condition method for the cultivation of isolated salivary gland cells. The dissociated submandibular salivary gland cells of mice were seeded and treated with Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632), which resulted in an increase in their cell adhesion, viability, migration, and proliferation. In particular, ROCK inhibitor treatment maintained the expression of α-amylase in the primary cultured salivary gland cells for a long time as compared with untreated cells. The expression of C-Met, a ductal cell marker, was increased in cells treated with ROCK inhibitor. This modified culture condition may serve as an easy and convenient tool for culturing primary salivary gland cells for their application in hyposalivation therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the classic problem of how single E. coli cells coordinate cell division with genome replication would open the way to addressing cell-cycle progression at the single-cell level. Recent studies produced new data, but the contrast in their conclusions and proposed mechanisms makes the emerging picture fragmented and unclear. Here, we re-evaluate available data and models, including generalizations based on the same assumptions. We show that although they provide useful insights, none of the proposed models captures all correlation patterns observed in data. We conclude that the assumption that replication is the bottleneck process for cell division is too restrictive. Instead, we propose that two concurrent cycles responsible for division and initiation of DNA replication set the time of cell division. This framework allows us to select a nearly constant added size per origin between subsequent initiations as the most likely mechanism setting initiation of replication.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons, particularly in the substantia nigra (SN). Although circadian dysfunction has been suggested as one of the pathophysiological risk factors for PD, the exact molecular link between the circadian clock and PD remains largely unclear. We have recently demonstrated that REV-ERBα, a circadian nuclear receptor, serves as a key molecular link between the circadian and DAergic systems. It competitively cooperates with NURR1, another nuclear receptor required for the optimal development and function of DA neurons, to control DAergic gene transcription. Considering our previous findings, we hypothesize that REV-ERBα may have a role in the onset and/or progression of PD. In the present study, we therefore aimed to elucidate whether genetic abrogation of REV-ERBα affects PD-related phenotypes in a mouse model of PD produced by a unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the dorsal striatum. REV-ERBα deficiency significantly exacerbated 6-OHDA-induced motor deficits as well as DAergic neuronal loss in the vertebral midbrain including the SN and the ventral tegmental area. The exacerbated DAergic degeneration likely involves neuroinflammation-mediated neurotoxicity. The Rev-erbα knockout mice showed prolonged microglial activation in the SN along with the overproduction of interleukin 1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in response to 6-OHDA. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that genetic abrogation of REV-ERBα can increase vulnerability of DAergic neurons to neurotoxic insults, such as 6-OHDA, thereby implying that its normal function may be beneficial for maintaining DAergic neuron populations during PD progression.

Abstract: Summary
Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare pediatric disease characterized by various systemic disorders, including hematopoietic dysfunction. The mutation of Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS) gene has been proposed to be a major causative reason for SDS. Although SBDS patients were reported to have shorter telomere length in granulocytes, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Here we provide data to elucidate the role of SBDS in telomere protection. We demonstrate that SBDS deficiency leads to telomere shortening. We found that overexpression of disease-associated SBDS mutants or knockdown of SBDS hampered the recruitment of telomerase onto telomeres, while the overall reverse transcriptase activity of telomerase remained unaffected. Moreover, we show that SBDS could specifically bind to TPP1 during the S phase of cell cycle, likely functioning as a stabilizer for TPP1-telomerase interaction. Our findings suggest that SBDS is a telomere-protecting protein that participates in regulating telomerase recruitment.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis, but their presence in tumor tissues impairs anti-tumor immunity and portends poor prognoses in cancer patients. Here, we reveal a mechanism to selectively target and reprogram the function of tumor-infiltrating Tregs (TI-Tregs) by exploiting their dependency on the histone H3K27 methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in tumors. Disruption of EZH2 activity in Tregs, either pharmacologically or genetically, drove the acquisition of pro-inflammatory functions in TI-Tregs, remodeling the tumor microenvironment and enhancing the recruitment and function of CD8+ and CD4+ effector T cells that eliminate tumors. Moreover, abolishing EZH2 function in Tregs was mechanistically distinct from, more potent than, and less toxic than a generalized Treg depletion approach. This study reveals a strategy to target Tregs in cancer that mitigates autoimmunity by reprogramming their function in tumors to enhance anti-cancer immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1) is a key regulator of synaptic function. We first tested whether SYNJ1 contributes to phenotypic variations in familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) and show that SYNJ1 polymorphisms are associated with age of onset in both early- and late-onset human FAD cohorts. We then interrogated whether SYNJ1 levels could directly affect memory. We show that increased SYNJ1 levels in autopsy brains from adults with Down syndrome (DS/AD) are inversely correlated with synaptophysin levels, a direct readout of synaptic integrity. We further report age-dependent cognitive decline in a mouse model overexpressing murine Synj1 to the levels observed in human sporadic AD, triggered through hippocampal hyperexcitability and defects in the spatial reproducibility of place fields. Taken together, our findings suggest that SYNJ1 contributes to memory deficits in the aging hippocampus in all forms of AD.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal interneurons coordinate the activity of motoneurons to generate the spatiotemporal patterns of muscle contractions required for vertebrate locomotion. It is controversial to what degree the orderly, gradual recruitment of motoneurons is determined by biophysical differences among them rather than by specific connections from presynaptic interneurons to subsets of motoneurons. To answer this question, we mapped all connections from two types of interneurons onto all motoneurons in a larval zebrafish spinal cord hemisegment, using serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM). We found specific synaptic connectivity from dorsal but not from ventral excitatory ipsilateral interneurons, with large motoneurons, active only when strong force is required, receiving specific inputs from dorsally located interneurons, active only during fast swims. By contrast, the connectivity between inhibitory commissural interneurons and motoneurons lacks any discernible pattern. The wiring pattern is consistent with a recruitment mechanism that depends to a considerable extent on specific connectivity.

Abstract: Summary
In collective cell migration, directional protrusions orient cells in response to external cues, which requires coordinated polarity among the migrating cohort. However, the molecular mechanism has not been well defined. Drosophila border cells (BCs) migrate collectively and invade via the confined space between nurse cells, offering an in vivo model to examine how group polarity is organized. Here, we show that the front/back polarity of BCs requires Rap1, hyperactivation of which disrupts cluster polarity and induces misoriented protrusions and loss of asymmetry in the actin network. Conversely, hypoactive Rap1 causes fewer protrusions and cluster spinning during migration. A forward genetic screen revealed that downregulation of the Hippo (Hpo) pathway core components hpo or mats enhances the Rap1V12-induced migration defect and misdirected protrusions. Mechanistically, association of Rap1V12 with the kinase domain of Hpo suppresses its activity, which releases Hpo signaling-mediated suppression of F-actin elongation, promoting cellular protrusions in collective cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
We sought to understand how cells collectively elongate epithelial tubes. We first used 3D culture and biosensor imaging to demonstrate that epithelial cells enrich Ras activity, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), and F-actin to their leading edges during migration within tissues. PIP3 enrichment coincided with, and could enrich despite inhibition of, F-actin dynamics, revealing a conserved migratory logic compared with single cells. We discovered that migratory cells can intercalate into the basal tissue surface and contribute to tube elongation. We then connected molecular activities to subcellular mechanics using force inference analysis. Migration and transient intercalation required specific and similar anterior-posterior ratios of interfacial tension. Permanent intercalations were distinguished by their capture at the boundary through time-varying tension dynamics. Finally, we integrated our experimental and computational data to generate a finite element model of tube elongation. Our model revealed that intercalation, interfacial tension dynamics, and high basal stress are together sufficient for mammary morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular bacterial pathogens secrete a repertoire of effector proteins into host cells that are required to hijack cellular pathways and cause disease. Despite decades of research, the molecular functions of most bacterial effectors remain unclear. To address this gap, we generated quantitative genetic interaction profiles between 36 validated and putative effectors from three evolutionarily divergent human bacterial pathogens and 4,190 yeast deletion strains. Correlating effector-generated profiles with those of yeast mutants, we recapitulated known biology for several effectors with remarkable specificity and predicted previously unknown functions for others. Biochemical and functional validation in human cells revealed a role for an uncharacterized component of the Salmonella SPI-2 translocon, SseC, in regulating maintenance of the Salmonella vacuole through interactions with components of the host retromer complex. These results exhibit the power of genetic interaction profiling to discover and dissect complex biology at the host-pathogen interface.

Abstract: Summary
To date, it remains largely unclear to what extent chromatin machinery contributes to the susceptibility and progression of complex diseases. Here, we combine deep epigenome mapping with single-cell transcriptomics to mine for evidence of chromatin dysregulation in type 2 diabetes. We find two chromatin-state signatures that track β cell dysfunction in mice and humans: ectopic activation of bivalent Polycomb-silenced domains and loss of expression at an epigenomically unique class of lineage-defining genes. β cell-specific Polycomb (Eed/PRC2) loss of function in mice triggers diabetes-mimicking transcriptional signatures and highly penetrant, hyperglycemia-independent dedifferentiation, indicating that PRC2 dysregulation contributes to disease. The work provides novel resources for exploring β cell transcriptional regulation and identifies PRC2 as necessary for long-term maintenance of β cell identity. Importantly, the data suggest a two-hit (chromatin and hyperglycemia) model for loss of β cell identity in diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Paxillin is a scaffold protein that participates in focal adhesion signaling in mammalian cells. Fission yeast paxillin ortholog, Pxl1, is required for contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) integrity and collaborates with the β-glucan synthase Bgs1 in septum formation. We show here that Pxl1’s main function is to recruit calcineurin (CN) phosphatase to the actomyosin ring; and thus the absence of either Pxl1 or calcineurin causes similar cytokinesis defects. In turn, CN participates in the dephosphorylation of the Cdc15 F-BAR protein, which recruits and concentrates Pxl1 at the CAR. Our findings suggest the existence of a positive feedback loop between Pxl1 and CN and establish that Pxl1 is a crucial component of the CN signaling pathway during cytokinesis.

Abstract: Summary
Physical exercise in combination with cognitive training is known to enhance synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory and lower the risk for various complex diseases including Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we show that exposure of adult male mice to an environmental enrichment paradigm leads to enhancement of synaptic plasticity and cognition also in the next generation. We show that this effect is mediated through sperm RNA and especially miRs 212/132. In conclusion, our study reports intergenerational inheritance of an acquired cognitive benefit and points to specific miRs as candidates mechanistically involved in this type of transmission.

Abstract: Summary
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are poorly understood. Macrophages, which are activated in T2D and causatively linked to atherogenesis, are an attractive mechanistic link. Here, we use proteomics to show that diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (obesity/IR) modulate a pro-atherogenic “macrophage-sterol-responsive-network” (MSRN), which, in turn, predisposes macrophages to cholesterol accumulation. We identify IFNγ as the mediator of obesity/IR-induced MSRN dysregulation and increased macrophage cholesterol accumulation and show that obesity/IR primes T cells to increase IFNγ production. Accordingly, myeloid cell-specific deletion of the IFNγ receptor (Ifngr1−/−) restores MSRN proteins, attenuates macrophage cholesterol accumulation and atherogenesis, and uncouples the strong relationship between hyperinsulinemia and aortic root lesion size in hypercholesterolemic Ldlr−/− mice with obesity/IR, but does not affect these parameters in Ldlr−/− mice without obesity/IR. Collectively, our findings identify an IFNγ-macrophage pathway as a mechanistic link between obesity/IR and accelerated atherogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
mTORC1 is a central signaling hub that integrates intra- and extracellular signals to regulate a variety of cellular metabolic processes. Mutations in regulators of mTORC1 lead to neurodevelopmental disorders associated with autism, which is characterized by repetitive, inflexible behaviors. These behaviors may result from alterations in striatal circuits that control motor learning and habit formation. However, the consequences of mTORC1 dysregulation on striatal neuron function are largely unknown. To investigate this, we deleted the mTORC1 negative regulator Tsc1 from identified striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons and examined how cell-autonomous upregulation of mTORC1 activity affects their morphology and physiology. We find that loss of Tsc1 increases the excitability of striatonigral, but not striatopallidal, neurons and selectively enhances corticostriatal synaptic transmission. These findings highlight the critical role of mTORC1 in regulating striatal activity in a cell type- and input-specific manner, with implications for striatonigral pathway dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disease.

Abstract: Summary
Glucocorticoid and other adipogenic hormones are secreted in mammals in circadian oscillations. Loss of this circadian oscillation pattern correlates with obesity in humans, raising the intriguing question of how hormone secretion dynamics affect adipocyte differentiation. Using live, single-cell imaging of the key adipogenic transcription factors CEBPB and PPARG, endogenously tagged with fluorescent proteins, we show that pulsatile circadian hormone stimuli are rejected by the adipocyte differentiation control system. In striking contrast, equally strong persistent signals trigger maximal differentiation. We identify the mechanism of how hormone oscillations are filtered as a combination of slow and fast positive feedback centered on PPARG. Furthermore, we confirm in mice that flattening of daily glucocorticoid oscillations significantly increases the mass of subcutaneous and visceral fat pads. Together, our study provides a molecular mechanism for why stress, Cushing’s disease, and other conditions for which glucocorticoid secretion loses its pulsatility may lead to obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Lympho-myeloid restricted early thymic progenitors (ETPs) are postulated to be the cell of origin for ETP leukemias, a therapy-resistant leukemia associated with frequent co-occurrence of EZH2 and RUNX1 inactivating mutations, and constitutively activating signaling pathway mutations. In a mouse model, we demonstrate that Ezh2 and Runx1 inactivation targeted to early lymphoid progenitors causes a marked expansion of pre-leukemic ETPs, showing transcriptional signatures characteristic of ETP leukemia. Addition of a RAS-signaling pathway mutation (Flt3-ITD) results in an aggressive leukemia co-expressing myeloid and lymphoid genes, which can be established and propagated in vivo by the expanded ETPs. Both mouse and human ETP leukemias show sensitivity to BET inhibition in vitro and in vivo, which reverses aberrant gene expression induced by Ezh2 inactivation.

Abstract: Summary
Atrophy of neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depression and related disorders. The ability to promote both structural and functional plasticity in the PFC has been hypothesized to underlie the fast-acting antidepressant properties of the dissociative anesthetic ketamine. Here, we report that, like ketamine, serotonergic psychedelics are capable of robustly increasing neuritogenesis and/or spinogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. These changes in neuronal structure are accompanied by increased synapse number and function, as measured by fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiology. The structural changes induced by psychedelics appear to result from stimulation of the TrkB, mTOR, and 5-HT2A signaling pathways and could possibly explain the clinical effectiveness of these compounds. Our results underscore the therapeutic potential of psychedelics and, importantly, identify several lead scaffolds for medicinal chemistry efforts focused on developing plasticity-promoting compounds as safe, effective, and fast-acting treatments for depression and related disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Intrinsic and evasive antiangiogenic drug (AAD) resistance is frequently developed in cancer patients, and molecular mechanisms underlying AAD resistance remain largely unknown. Here we describe AAD-triggered, lipid-dependent metabolic reprogramming as an alternative mechanism of AAD resistance. Unexpectedly, tumor angiogenesis in adipose and non-adipose environments is equally sensitive to AAD treatment. AAD-treated tumors in adipose environment show accelerated growth rates in the presence of a minimal number of microvessels. Mechanistically, AAD-induced tumor hypoxia initiates the fatty acid oxidation metabolic reprogramming and increases uptake of free fatty acid (FFA) that stimulates cancer cell proliferation. Inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1) significantly compromises the FFA-induced cell proliferation. Genetic and pharmacological loss of CPT1 function sensitizes AAD therapeutic efficacy and enhances its anti-tumor effects. Together, we propose an effective cancer therapy concept by combining drugs that target angiogenesis and lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
During brainstem development, newborn neurons originating from the rhombic lip embark on exceptionally long migrations to generate nuclei important for audition, movement, and respiration. Along the way, this highly motile population passes several cranial nerves yet remains confined to the CNS. We found that Ntn1 accumulates beneath the pial surface separating the CNS from the PNS, with gaps at nerve entry sites. In mice null for Ntn1 or its receptor DCC, hindbrain neurons enter cranial nerves and migrate into the periphery. CNS neurons also escape when Ntn1 is selectively lost from the sub-pial region (SPR), and conversely, expression of Ntn1 throughout the mutant hindbrain can prevent their departure. These findings identify a permissive role for Ntn1 in maintaining the CNS-PNS boundary. We propose that Ntn1 confines rhombic lip-derived neurons by providing a preferred substrate for tangentially migrating neurons in the SPR, preventing their entry into nerve roots.

Mind Bomb Regulates Cell Death during TNF Signaling by Suppressing RIPK1’s Cytotoxic Potential,

Abstract: Summary
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an inflammatory cytokine that can signal cell survival or cell death. The mechanisms that switch between these distinct outcomes remain poorly defined. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mind Bomb-2 (MIB2) regulates TNF-induced cell death by inactivating RIPK1 via inhibitory ubiquitylation. Although depletion of MIB2 has little effect on NF-κB activation, it sensitizes cells to RIPK1- and caspase-8-dependent cell death. We find that MIB2 represses the cytotoxic potential of RIPK1 by ubiquitylating lysine residues in the C-terminal portion of RIPK1. Our data suggest that ubiquitin conjugation of RIPK1 interferes with RIPK1 oligomerization and RIPK1-FADD association. Disruption of MIB2-mediated ubiquitylation, either by mutation of MIB2’s E3 activity or RIPK1’s ubiquitin-acceptor lysines, sensitizes cells to RIPK1-mediated cell death. Together, our findings demonstrate that Mind Bomb E3 ubiquitin ligases can function as additional checkpoint of cytokine-induced cell death, selectively protecting cells from the cytotoxic effects of TNF.

UCHL3 Regulates Topoisomerase-Induced Chromosomal Break Repair by Controlling TDP1 Proteostasis,

Abstract: Summary
Genomic damage can feature DNA-protein crosslinks whereby their acute accumulation is utilized to treat cancer and progressive accumulation causes neurodegeneration. This is typified by tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), which repairs topoisomerase-mediated chromosomal breaks. Although TDP1 levels vary in multiple clinical settings, the mechanism underpinning this variation is unknown. We reveal that TDP1 is controlled by ubiquitylation and identify UCHL3 as the deubiquitylase that controls TDP1 proteostasis. Depletion of UCHL3 increases TDP1 ubiquitylation and turnover rate and sensitizes cells to TOP1 poisons. Overexpression of UCHL3, but not a catalytically inactive mutant, suppresses TDP1 ubiquitylation and turnover rate. TDP1 overexpression in the topoisomerase therapy-resistant rhabdomyosarcoma is driven by UCHL3 overexpression. In contrast, UCHL3 is downregulated in spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1), causing elevated levels of TDP1 ubiquitylation and faster turnover rate. These data establish UCHL3 as a regulator of TDP1 proteostasis and, consequently, a fine-tuner of protein-linked DNA break repair.

FTIP-Dependent STM Trafficking Regulates Shoot Meristem Development in Arabidopsis,

Abstract: Summary
Organogenesis in higher plants occurs in the shoot meristem, which contains pluripotent stem cells. Here, we show that two multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins, FT INTERACTING PROTEIN 3 (FTIP3) and FTIP4, play an essential role in mediating proliferation and differentiation of shoot stem cells in Arabidopsis. FTIP3/4 prevent intracellular trafficking of a key regulator, SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM), to the plasma membrane in cells in the peripheral shoot meristem region. This facilitates STM recycling to the nucleus to maintain stem cells. Without FTIP3/4, STM localizes substantially to the plasma membrane, which promotes intercellular trafficking but compromises nuclear localization of STM. This accelerates stem cell differentiation, causing early termination of shoot apices and resulting in dwarf and bushy phenotypes. Our findings reveal a molecular framework that determines the fate of shoot stem cells and the resulting aboveground plant body.

Poly(ADP-Ribose) Prevents Pathological Phase Separation of TDP-43 by Promoting Liquid Demixing and Stress Granule Localization,

Abstract: Summary
In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), cytoplasmic aggregates of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 accumulate and colocalize with some stress granule components, but how pathological TDP-43 aggregation is nucleated remains unknown. In Drosophila, we establish that downregulation of tankyrase, a poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase, reduces TDP-43 accumulation in the cytoplasm and potently mitigates neurodegeneration. We establish that TDP-43 non-covalently binds to PAR via PAR-binding motifs embedded within its nuclear localization sequence. PAR binding promotes liquid-liquid phase separation of TDP-43 in vitro and is required for TDP-43 accumulation in stress granules in mammalian cells and neurons. Stress granule localization initially protects TDP-43 from disease-associated phosphorylation, but upon long-term stress, stress granules resolve, leaving behind aggregates of phosphorylated TDP-43. Finally, small-molecule inhibition of Tankyrase-1/2 in mammalian cells inhibits formation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 foci without affecting stress granule assembly. Thus, Tankyrase inhibition antagonizes TDP-43-associated pathology and neurodegeneration and could have therapeutic utility for ALS and FTD.

Abstract: Summary
We analyzed 921 adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum to examine shared and distinguishing molecular characteristics of gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas (GIACs). Hypermutated tumors were distinct regardless of cancer type and comprised those enriched for insertions/deletions, representing microsatellite instability cases with epigenetic silencing of MLH1 in the context of CpG island methylator phenotype, plus tumors with elevated single-nucleotide variants associated with mutations in POLE. Tumors with chromosomal instability were diverse, with gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas harboring fragmented genomes associated with genomic doubling and distinct mutational signatures. We identified a group of tumors in the colon and rectum lacking hypermutation and aneuploidy termed genome stable and enriched in DNA hypermethylation and mutations in KRAS, SOX9, and PCBP1.

Abstract: Summary
Polycistronic architecture is common for synthetic gene circuits, however, it remains unknown how expression of one gene is affected by the presence of other genes/noncoding regions in the operon, termed adjacent transcriptional regions (ATR). Here, we constructed synthetic operons with a reporter gene flanked by different ATRs, and we found that ATRs with high GC content, small size, and low folding energy lead to high gene expression. Based on these results, we built a model of gene expression and generated a metric that takes into account ATRs. We used the metric to design and construct logic gates with low basal expression and high sensitivity and nonlinearity. Furthermore, we rationally designed synthetic 5′ATRs with different GC content and sizes to tune protein expression levels over a 300-fold range and used these to build synthetic toggle switches with varying basal expression and degrees of bistability. Our comprehensive model and gene expression metric could facilitate the future engineering of more complex synthetic gene circuits.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive Schwann cell (SC)-lineage-derived sarcomas. Molecular events driving SC-to-MPNST transformation are incompletely understood. Here, we show that human MPNSTs exhibit elevated HIPPO-TAZ/YAP expression, and that TAZ/YAP hyperactivity in SCs caused by Lats1/2 loss potently induces high-grade nerve-associated tumors with full penetrance. Lats1/2 deficiency reprograms SCs to a cancerous, progenitor-like phenotype and promotes hyperproliferation. Conversely, disruption of TAZ/YAP activity alleviates tumor burden in Lats1/2-deficient mice and inhibits human MPNST cell proliferation. Moreover, genome-wide profiling reveals that TAZ/YAP-TEAD1 directly activates oncogenic programs, including platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling. Co-targeting TAZ/YAP and PDGFR pathways inhibits tumor growth. Thus, our findings establish a previously unrecognized convergence between Lats1/2-TAZ/YAP signaling and MPNST pathogenesis, revealing potential therapeutic targets in these untreatable tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The integrated stress response (ISR) facilitates cellular adaptation to stress conditions via the common target eIF2α. During ISR, the selective translation of stress-related mRNAs often relies on alternative mechanisms, such as leaky scanning or reinitiation, but the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here we report that, in response to amino acid starvation, the reinitiation of ATF4 is not only governed by the eIF2α signaling pathway, but is also subjected to regulation by mRNA methylation in the form of N6-methyladenosine (m6A). While depleting m6A demethylases represses ATF4 reinitiation, knocking down m6A methyltransferases promotes ATF4 translation. We demonstrate that m6A in the 5′ UTR controls ribosome scanning and subsequent start codon selection. Global profiling of initiating ribosomes reveals widespread alternative translation events influenced by dynamic mRNA methylation. Consistently, Fto transgenic mice manifest enhanced ATF4 expression, highlighting the critical role of m6A in translational regulation of ISR at cellular and organismal levels.

Abstract: Summary
SF3B is a multi-protein complex essential for branch site (BS) recognition and selection during pre-mRNA splicing. Several splicing modulators with antitumor activity bind SF3B and thereby modulate splicing. Here we report the crystal structure of a human SF3B core in complex with pladienolide B (PB), a macrocyclic splicing modulator and potent inhibitor of tumor cell proliferation. PB stalls SF3B in an open conformation by acting like a wedge within a hinge, modulating SF3B’s transition to the closed conformation needed to form the BS adenosine-binding pocket and stably accommodate the BS/U2 duplex. This work explains the structural basis for the splicing modulation activity of PB and related compounds, and reveals key interactions between SF3B and a common pharmacophore, providing a framework for future structure-based drug design.

Abstract: Summary
The inhibitory effects of cancer on T cell metabolism have been well established, but the metabolic impact of immunotherapy on tumor cells is poorly understood. Here, we developed a CD4+ T cell-based adoptive immunotherapy protocol that was curative for mice with implanted colorectal tumors. By conducting metabolic profiling on tumors, we show that adoptive immunotherapy profoundly altered tumor metabolism, resulting in glutathione depletion and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cells. We further demonstrate that T cell-derived tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) can synergize with chemotherapy to intensify oxidative stress and tumor cell death in an NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen) oxidase-dependent manner. Reduction of oxidative stress, by preventing TNF-α-signaling in tumor cells or scavenging ROS, antagonized the therapeutic effects of adoptive immunotherapy. Conversely, provision of pro-oxidants after chemotherapy can partially recapitulate the antitumor effects of T cell transfer. These findings imply that reinforcing tumor oxidative stress represents an important mechanism underlying the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy.

Abstract: Flowering time is determined by florigens. These genes include, Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and Rice FT 1 (RFT1) in rice, which are specifically expressed in the vascular tissues of leaves at the floral transition stage. To study the cis-regulatory elements present in the promoter region of Hd3a, we generated transgenic plants carrying the 1.75-kb promoter fragment of Hd3a that was fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. Plants expressing this construct conferred a vascular cell-specific expression pattern for the reporter gene. However, GUS was expressed in leaves at all developmental stages, including the early seedling stage when Hd3a was not detected. Furthermore, the reporter was expressed in roots at all stages. This suggests that the 1.75-kb region lackings cis-elements that regulate leaf-specific expression at the appropriate developmental stages. Deletion analyses of the promoter region indicated that regulatory elements determining vascular cell-specific expression are present in the 200-bp region between -245 bp and -45 bp from the transcription initiation site. By transforming the Hd3a–GUS construct to rice cultivar ‘Taichung 65’ which is defective in Ehd1, we observed that Ehd1 is the major regulatory element that controls Hd3a promoter activity.

Abstract: Summary
Axonal regrowth is crucial for recovery from CNS injury but is severely restricted in adult mammals. We used a genome-wide loss-of-function screen for factors limiting axonal regeneration from cerebral cortical neurons in vitro. Knockdown of 16,007 individual genes identified 580 significant phenotypes. These molecules share no significant overlap with those suggested by previous expression profiles. There is enrichment for genes in pathways related to transport, receptor binding, and cytokine signaling, including Socs4 and Ship2. Among transport-regulating proteins, Rab GTPases are prominent. In vivo assessment with C. elegans validates a cell-autonomous restriction of regeneration by Rab27. Mice lacking Rab27b show enhanced retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration after optic nerve crush and greater motor function and raphespinal sprouting after spinal cord trauma. Thus, a comprehensive functional screen reveals multiple pathways restricting axonal regeneration and neurological recovery after injury.

Abstract: Summary
Despite advances made in understanding the effects of promoter structure on transcriptional activity, limited knowledge exists regarding the role played by chromatin architecture in transcription. Previous work hypothesized that transcription from the bidirectional GAL1/GAL10 promoter is controlled through looping of its UAS region around a nonstandard nucleosome. Here, by editing the GAL1/GAL10 promoter at high resolution, we provide insights into bidirectional expression control. We demonstrate that the first and fourth Gal4 binding sites within the UAS do not functionally contribute to promoter activation. Instead, these sites, along with nearby regulatory regions, contribute to the directional regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, Gal4 binding to the third binding site is critical for gene expression, while binding to the other three sites is not sufficient for transcriptional activation. Because the GAL1/GAL10 UAS can activate gene expression in many eukaryotes, the regulatory mechanism presented is expected to operate broadly across the eukaryotic clade.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria associate with lipid droplets (LDs) in fat-oxidizing tissues, but the functional role of these peridroplet mitochondria (PDM) is unknown. Microscopic observation of interscapular brown adipose tissue reveals that PDM have unique protein composition and cristae structure and remain adherent to the LD in the tissue homogenate. We developed an approach to isolate PDM based on their adherence to LDs. Comparison of purified PDM to cytoplasmic mitochondria reveals that (1) PDM have increased pyruvate oxidation, electron transport, and ATP synthesis capacities; (2) PDM have reduced β-oxidation capacity and depart from LDs upon activation of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and β-oxidation; (3) PDM support LD expansion as Perilipin5-induced recruitment of mitochondria to LDs increases ATP synthase-dependent triacylglyceride synthesis; and (4) PDM maintain a distinct protein composition due to uniquely low fusion-fission dynamics. We conclude that PDM represent a segregated mitochondrial population with unique structure and function that supports triacylglyceride synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
AgRP neurons control peripheral substrate utilization and nutrient partitioning during conditions of energy deficit and nutrient replenishment, although the molecular mechanism is unknown. We examined whether carnitine acetyltransferase (Crat) in AgRP neurons affects peripheral nutrient partitioning. Crat deletion in AgRP neurons reduced food intake and feeding behavior and increased glycerol supply to the liver during fasting, as a gluconeogenic substrate, which was mediated by changes to sympathetic output and peripheral fatty acid metabolism in the liver. Crat deletion in AgRP neurons increased peripheral fatty acid substrate utilization and attenuated the switch to glucose utilization after refeeding, indicating altered nutrient partitioning. Proteomic analysis in AgRP neurons shows that Crat regulates protein acetylation and metabolic processing. Collectively, our studies highlight that AgRP neurons require Crat to provide the metabolic flexibility to optimize nutrient partitioning and regulate peripheral substrate utilization, particularly during fasting and refeeding.

Abstract: Summary
It has been posited that anti-tumoral innate activation is driven by derepression of endogenous repeats. We compared RNA sequencing protocols to assess repeat transcriptomes in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Although poly(A) selection efficiently detects coding genes, most non-coding genes, and limited subsets of repeats, it fails to capture overall repeat expression and co-expression. Alternatively, total RNA expression reveals distinct repeat co-expression subgroups and delivers greater dynamic changes, implying they may serve as better biomarkers of clinical outcomes. We show that endogenous retrovirus expression predicts immunotherapy response better than conventional immune signatures in one cohort yet is not predictive in another. Moreover, we find that global repeat derepression, including the HSATII satellite repeat, correlates with an immunosuppressive phenotype in colorectal and pancreatic tumors and validate in situ. In conclusion, we stress the importance of analyzing the full spectrum of repeat transcription to decode their role in tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancers are thought to activate transcription by physically contacting promoters via looping. However, direct assays demonstrating these contacts are required to mechanistically verify such cellular determinants of enhancer function. Here, we present versatile cell-free assays to further determine the role of enhancer-promoter contacts (EPCs). We demonstrate that EPC is linked to mutually stimulatory transcription at the enhancer and promoter in vitro. SRC-3 was identified as a critical looping determinant for the estradiol-(E2)-regulated GREB1 locus. Surprisingly, the GREB1 enhancer and promoter contact two internal gene body SRC-3 binding sites, GBS1 and GBS2, which stimulate their transcription. Utilizing time-course 3C assays, we uncovered SRC-3-dependent dynamic chromatin interactions involving the enhancer, promoter, GBS1, and GBS2. Collectively, these data suggest that the enhancer and promoter remain “poised” for transcription via their contacts with GBS1 and GBS2. Upon E2 induction, GBS1 and GBS2 disengage from the enhancer, allowing direct EPC for active transcription.

Abstract: Summary
DNA-RNA hybrids associated with R-loops promote DNA damage and genomic instability. The capacity of hybrids at different genomic sites to cause DNA damage was not known, and the mechanisms leading from hybrid to damage were poorly understood. Here, we adopt a new strategy to map and characterize the sites of hybrid-induced damage genome-wide in budding yeast. We show that hybrid removal is essential for life because persistent hybrids cause irreparable DNA damage and cell death. We identify that a subset of hybrids is prone to cause damage, and the chromosomal context of hybrids dramatically impacts their ability to induce damage. Furthermore, persistent hybrids affect the repair pathway, generating large regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) by two distinct mechanisms, likely resection and re-replication. These damaged regions may act as potential precursors to gross chromosomal rearrangements like deletions and duplications that are associated with R-loops and cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Precise cell division control is critical for developmental patterning. For the differentiation of a functional stoma, a cellular valve for efficient gas exchange, the single symmetric division of an immediate precursor is absolutely essential. Yet, the mechanism governing this event remains unclear. Here we report comprehensive inventories of gene expression by the Arabidopsis bHLH protein MUTE, a potent inducer of stomatal differentiation. MUTE switches the gene expression program initiated by SPEECHLESS. MUTE directly induces a suite of cell-cycle genes, including CYCD5;1, in which introduced expression triggers the symmetric divisions of arrested precursor cells in mute, and their transcriptional repressors, FAMA and FOUR LIPS. The regulatory network initiated by MUTE represents an incoherent type 1 feed-forward loop. Our mathematical modeling and experimental perturbations support a notion that MUTE orchestrates a transcriptional cascade leading to a tightly restricted pulse of cell-cycle gene expression, thereby ensuring the single cell division to create functional stomata.

Abstract: Summary
CDH1 and PIK3CA are the two most frequently mutated genes in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) of the breast. Transcription profiling has identified molecular subtypes for ILC, one of which, immune-related (IR), is associated with gene expression linked to lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration. Here, we report that deletion of Cdh1, together with activation of Pik3ca in mammary epithelium of genetically modified mice, leads to formation of IR-ILC-like tumors with immune cell infiltration, as well as gene expression linked to T-regulatory (Treg) cell signaling and activation of targetable immune checkpoint pathways. Interestingly, these tumors show enhanced Rac1- and Yap-dependent transcription and signaling, as well as sensitivity to PI3K, Rac1, and Yap inhibitors in culture. Finally, high-dimensional immunophenotyping in control mouse mammary gland and IR-ILC tumors by mass cytometry shows dramatic alterations in myeloid and lymphoid populations associated with immune suppression and exhaustion, highlighting the potential for therapeutic intervention via immune checkpoint regulators.

Abstract: Summary
Group A Streptococcus (GAS) remains one of the top 10 deadliest human pathogens worldwide despite its sensitivity to penicillin. Although the most common GAS infection is pharyngitis (strep throat), it also causes life-threatening systemic infections. A series of complex networks between host and pathogen drive invasive infections, which have not been comprehensively mapped. Attempting to map these interactions, we examined organ-level protein dynamics using a mouse model of systemic GAS infection. We quantified over 11,000 proteins, defining organ-specific markers for all analyzed tissues. From this analysis, an atlas of dynamically regulated proteins and pathways was constructed. Through statistical methods, we narrowed organ-specific markers of infection to 34 from the defined atlas. We show these markers are trackable in blood of infected mice, and a subset has been observed in plasma samples from GAS-infected clinical patients. This proteomics-based strategy provides insight into host defense responses, establishes potentially useful targets for therapeutic intervention, and presents biomarkers for determining affected organs during bacterial infection.

Abstract: Summary
Successful regeneration of severed peripheral nerves requires the breakdown and subsequent clearance of myelin, tightly packed membrane sheaths of Schwann cells that protect nerve fibers and harbor nerve growth-inhibitory proteins. How Schwann cells initiate myelin breakdown in response to injury is still largely unknown. Here we report that, following sciatic nerve injury, MLKL, a pseudokinase known to rupture cell membranes during necroptotic cell death, is induced and targets the myelin sheath membrane of Schwann cells to promote myelin breakdown. The function of MLKL in disrupting myelin sheaths requires injury-induced phosphorylation of serine 441, an activation signal distinct from the necroptosis-inducing phosphorylation by RIP3 kinase. Mice with Mlkl specifically knocked out in Schwann cells showed delayed myelin sheath breakdown. Lack of MLKL reduced nerve regeneration following injury, whereas overexpression of MLKL accelerated myelin breakdown and promoted the regeneration of axons.

Abstract: Summary
To understand how undifferentiated pluripotent cells cope with cell corpses, we examined the clearance of polar bodies born during female meiosis. We found that polar bodies lose membrane integrity and expose phosphatidylserine in Caenorhabditis elegans. Polar body signaling recruits engulfment receptors to the plasma membrane of embryonic blastomeres using the PI3K VPS-34, RAB-5 GTPase and the sorting nexin SNX-6. The second polar body is then phagocytosed using receptor-mediated engulfment pathways dependent on the Rac1 ortholog CED-10 but undergoes non-apoptotic programmed cell death independent of engulfment. RAB-7 GTPase is required for lysosome recruitment to the polar body phagosome, while LC3 lipidation is required for degradation of the corpse membrane after lysosome fusion. The polar body phagolysosome vesiculates in an mTOR- and ARL-8-dependent manner, which assists its timely degradation. Thus, we established a genetic model to study clearance by LC3-associated phagocytosis and reveal insights into the mechanisms of phagosome maturation and degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Growing resistance of pathogenic bacteria and shortage of antibiotic discovery platforms challenge the use of antibiotics in the clinic. This threat calls for exploration of unconventional sources of antibiotics and identification of inhibitors able to eradicate resistant bacteria. Here we describe a different class of antibiotics, odilorhabdins (ODLs), produced by the enzymes of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster of the nematode-symbiotic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila. ODLs show activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and can eradicate infections in animal models. We demonstrate that the bactericidal ODLs interfere with protein synthesis. Genetic and structural analyses reveal that ODLs bind to the small ribosomal subunit at a site not exploited by current antibiotics. ODLs induce miscoding and promote hungry codon readthrough, amino acid misincorporation, and premature stop codon bypass. We propose that ODLs’ miscoding activity reflects their ability to increase the affinity of non-cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome.

Abstract: Summary
In recent decades, optogenetics has been transforming neuroscience research, enabling neuroscientists to drive and read neural circuits. The recent development in illumination approaches combined with two-photon (2P) excitation, either sequential or parallel, has opened the route for brain circuit manipulation with single-cell resolution and millisecond temporal precision. Yet, the high excitation power required for multi-target photostimulation, especially under 2P illumination, raises questions about the induced local heating inside samples. Here, we present and experimentally validate a theoretical model that makes it possible to simulate 3D light propagation and heat diffusion in optically scattering samples at high spatial and temporal resolution under the illumination configurations most commonly used to perform 2P optogenetics: single- and multi-spot holographic illumination and spiral laser scanning. By investigating the effects of photostimulation repetition rate, spot spacing, and illumination dependence of heat diffusion, we found conditions that make it possible to design a multi-target 2P optogenetics experiment with minimal sample heating.

Jumonji Inhibitors Overcome Radioresistance in Cancer through Changes in H3K4 Methylation at Double-Strand Breaks,

Abstract: Summary
We have uncovered a role for Jumonji inhibitors in overcoming radioresistance through KDM5B inhibition. Pharmacological blockade of Jumonji demethylases with JIB-04 leads to specific accumulation of H3K4me3 at sites marked by γH2AX and impaired recruitment of DNA repair factors, preventing resolution of damage and resulting in robust sensitization to radiation therapy. In DNA-repair-proficient cancer cells, knockdown of the H3K4me3 demethylase KDM5B, but not other Jumonji enzymes, mimics pharmacological inhibition, and KDM5B overexpression rescues this phenotype and increases radioresistance. The H3K4me3 demethylase inhibitor PBIT also sensitizes cancer cells to radiation, while an H3K27me3 demethylase inhibitor does not. In vivo co-administration of radiation with JIB-04 significantly prolongs the survival of mice with tumors even long after cessation of treatment. In human patients, lung squamous cell carcinomas highly expressing KDM5B respond poorly to radiation. Thus, we propose the use of Jumonji KDM inhibitors as potent radiosensitizers.

Abstract: Summary
Telomerase, the end-replication enzyme, is reactivated in malignant cancers to drive cellular immortality. While this distinction makes telomerase an attractive target for anti-cancer therapies, most approaches for inhibiting its activity have been clinically ineffective. As opposed to inhibiting telomerase, we use its activity to selectively promote cytotoxicity in cancer cells. We show that several nucleotide analogs, including 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (5-FdU) triphosphate, are effectively incorporated by telomerase into a telomere DNA product. Administration of 5-FdU results in an increased number of telomere-induced foci, impedes binding of telomere proteins, activates the ATR-related DNA-damage response, and promotes cell death in a telomerase-dependent manner. Collectively, our data indicate that telomerase activity can be exploited as a putative anti-cancer strategy.

MYC Releases Early Reprogrammed Human Cells from Proliferation Pause via Retinoblastoma Protein Inhibition,

Abstract: Summary
Here, we report that MYC rescues early human cells undergoing reprogramming from a proliferation pause induced by OCT3/4, SOX2, and KLF4 (OSK). We identified ESRG as a marker of early reprogramming cells that is expressed as early as day 3 after OSK induction. On day 4, ESRG positive (+) cells converted to a TRA-1-60 (+) intermediate state. These early ESRG (+) or TRA-1-60 (+) cells showed a proliferation pause due to increased p16INK4A and p21 and decreased endogenous MYC caused by OSK. Exogenous MYC did not enhance the appearance of initial reprogramming cells but instead reactivated their proliferation and improved reprogramming efficiency. MYC increased expression of LIN41, which potently suppressed p21 post-transcriptionally. MYC suppressed p16 INK4A. These changes inactivated retinoblastoma protein (RB) and reactivated proliferation. The RB-regulated proliferation pause does not occur in immortalized fibroblasts, leading to high reprogramming efficiency even without exogenous MYC.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming provides critical information for clinical oncology. Using molecular data of 9,125 patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified tumor subtypes in 33 cancer types based on mRNA expression patterns of seven major metabolic processes and assessed their clinical relevance. Our metabolic expression subtypes correlated extensively with clinical outcome: subtypes with upregulated carbohydrate, nucleotide, and vitamin/cofactor metabolism most consistently correlated with worse prognosis, whereas subtypes with upregulated lipid metabolism showed the opposite. Metabolic subtypes correlated with diverse somatic drivers but exhibited effects convergent on cancer hallmark pathways and were modulated by highly recurrent master regulators across cancer types. As a proof-of-concept example, we demonstrated that knockdown of SNAI1 or RUNX1—master regulators of carbohydrate metabolic subtypes—modulates metabolic activity and drug sensitivity. Our study provides a system-level view of metabolic heterogeneity within and across cancer types and identifies pathway cross-talk, suggesting related prognostic, therapeutic, and predictive utility.

Abstract: Summary
The genetic regulation and physiological impact of most lipid species are unexplored. Here, we profiled 129 plasma lipid species across 49 strains of the BXD mouse genetic reference population fed either chow or a high-fat diet. By integrating these data with genomics and phenomics datasets, we elucidated genes by environment (diet) interactions that regulate systemic metabolism. We found quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for ∼94% of the lipids measured. Several QTLs harbored genes associated with blood lipid levels and abnormal lipid metabolism in human genome-wide association studies. Lipid species from different classes provided signatures of metabolic health, including seven plasma triglyceride species that associated with either healthy or fatty liver. This observation was further validated in an independent mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and in plasma from NAFLD patients. This work provides a resource to identify plausible genes regulating the measured lipid species and their association with metabolic traits.

Abstract: Summary
Linking regulatory DNA elements to their target genes, which may be located hundreds of kilobases away, remains challenging. Here, we introduce Cicero, an algorithm that identifies co-accessible pairs of DNA elements using single-cell chromatin accessibility data and so connects regulatory elements to their putative target genes. We apply Cicero to investigate how dynamically accessible elements orchestrate gene regulation in differentiating myoblasts. Groups of Cicero-linked regulatory elements meet criteria of “chromatin hubs”—they are enriched for physical proximity, interact with a common set of transcription factors, and undergo coordinated changes in histone marks that are predictive of changes in gene expression. Pseudotemporal analysis revealed that most DNA elements remain in chromatin hubs throughout differentiation. A subset of elements bound by MYOD1 in myoblasts exhibit early opening in a PBX1- and MEIS1-dependent manner. Our strategy can be applied to dissect the architecture, sequence determinants, and mechanisms of cis-regulation on a genome-wide scale.

Abstract: Summary
Atypical cadherin Dachsous (Dchs) is a conserved regulator of planar cell polarity, morphogenesis, and tissue growth during animal development. Dchs functions in part by regulating microtubules by unknown molecular mechanisms. Here we show that maternal zygotic (MZ) dchs1b zebrafish mutants exhibit cleavage furrow progression defects and impaired midzone microtubule assembly associated with decreased microtubule turnover. Mechanistically, Dchs1b interacts via a conserved motif in its intracellular domain with the tetratricopeptide motifs of Ttc28 and regulates its subcellular distribution. Excess Ttc28 impairs cleavages and decreases microtubule turnover, while ttc28 inactivation increases turnover. Moreover, ttc28 deficiency in dchs1b mutants suppresses the microtubule dynamics and midzone microtubule assembly defects. Dchs1b also binds to Aurora B, a known regulator of cleavages and microtubules. Embryonic cleavages in MZdchs1b mutants exhibit increased, and in MZttc28 mutants decreased, sensitivity to Aurora B inhibition. Thus, Dchs1b regulates microtubule dynamics and embryonic cleavages by interacting with Ttc28 and Aurora B.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin-modifying enzymes, and specifically the protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), have emerged as important targets in cancer. Here, we investigated the role of CARM1 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Using conditional knockout mice, we show that loss of CARM1 has little effect on normal hematopoiesis. Strikingly, knockout of Carm1 abrogates both the initiation and maintenance of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driven by oncogenic transcription factors. We show that CARM1 knockdown impairs cell-cycle progression, promotes myeloid differentiation, and ultimately induces apoptosis. Finally, we utilize a selective, small-molecule inhibitor of CARM1 to validate the efficacy of CARM1 inhibition in leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, this work suggests that targeting CARM1 may be an effective therapeutic strategy for AML.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical networks are composed of excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Finding the right balance between the two is important for controlling overall cortical excitation and network dynamics. However, it is unclear how the correct number of cortical interneurons (CIs) is established in the mammalian forebrain. CIs are generated in excess from basal forebrain progenitors, and their final numbers are adjusted via an intrinsically determined program of apoptosis that takes place during an early postnatal window. Here, we provide evidence that the extent of CI apoptosis during this critical period is plastic and cell-type specific and can be reduced in a cell-autonomous manner by acute increases in neuronal activity.

Abstract: The tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) protein is a retinoid-inducible growth regulator and is considered a tumor suppressor. Here, we show that DnaJ heat shock protein family member C8 (DNAJC8) is a TIG1 target that regulates glycolysis. Ectopic DNAJC8 expression induced the translocation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) into the nucleus, subsequently inducing glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression to promote glucose uptake. Silencing either DNAJC8 or PKM2 alleviated the upregulation of GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake induced by ectopic DNAJC8 expression. TIG1 interacted with DNAJC8 in the cytosol, and this interaction completely blocked DNAJC8-mediated PKM2 translocation and inhibited glucose uptake. Furthermore, increased glycose uptake was observed in cells in which TIG1 was silenced. In conclusion, TIG1 acts as a pivotal repressor of DNAJC8 to enhance glucose uptake by partially regulating PKM2 translocation.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial or endogenous molecular patterns as well as pathogen functional features can activate innate immune systems. Whereas detection of infection by pattern recognition receptors has been investigated in details, sensing of virulence factors activities remains less characterized. In Drosophila, genetic evidences indicate that the serine protease Persephone belongs to a danger pathway activated by abnormal proteolytic activities to induce Toll signaling. However, neither the activation mechanism of this pathway nor its specificity has been determined. Here, we identify a unique region in the pro-domain of Persephone that functions as bait for exogenous proteases independently of their origin, type, or specificity. Cleavage in this bait region constitutes the first step of a sequential activation and licenses the subsequent maturation of Persephone to the endogenous cysteine cathepsin 26-29-p. Our results establish Persephone itself as an immune receptor able to sense a broad range of microbes through virulence factor activities rather than molecular patterns.

Abstract: Summary
Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targeting the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) typically take years to develop. Longitudinal analyses of both neutralizing antibody lineages and viruses at serial time points during infection provide a basis for understanding the co-evolutionary contest between HIV and the humoral immune system. Here, we describe the structural characterization of an apex-targeting antibody lineage and autologous clade A viral Env from a donor in the Protocol C cohort. Comparison of Ab-Env complexes at early and late time points reveals that, within the antibody lineage, the CDRH3 loop rigidifies, the bnAb angle of approach steepens, and surface charges are mutated to accommodate glycan changes. Additionally, we observed differences in site-specific glycosylation between soluble and full-length Env constructs, which may be important for tuning optimal immunogenicity in soluble Env trimers. These studies therefore provide important guideposts for design of immunogens that prime and mature nAb responses to the Env V2-apex.

Abstract: Summary
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the primordial germ cells Z2 and Z3 are born during early embryogenesis and then held in a transcriptionally quiescent state where the genome is highly compacted. When hatched L1s feed, the germline genome decompacts, and RNAPII is abruptly and globally activated. A previously documented yet unexplained feature of germline genome activation in the worm is the appearance of numerous DNA breaks coincident with RNAPII transcription. Here, we show that the DNA breaks are induced by topoisomerase II and that they function to recruit the RUVB complex to chromosomes so that RUVB can decompact the chromatin. DNA break- and RUVB-mediated decompaction is required for zygotic genome activation. This work highlights the importance of global chromatin decompaction in the rapid induction of gene expression and shows that one way cells achieve global decompaction is through programmed DNA breaks.

Abstract: Summary
A current challenge in cell motility studies is to understand the molecular and physical mechanisms that govern chemokine receptor nanoscale organization at the cell membrane, and their influence on cell response. Using single-particle tracking and super-resolution microscopy, we found that the chemokine receptor CXCR4 forms basal nanoclusters in resting T cells, whose extent, dynamics, and signaling strength are modulated by the orchestrated action of the actin cytoskeleton, the co-receptor CD4, and its ligand CXCL12. We identified three CXCR4 structural residues that are crucial for nanoclustering and generated an oligomerization-defective mutant that dimerized but did not form nanoclusters in response to CXCL12, which severely impaired signaling. Overall, our data provide new insights to the field of chemokine biology by showing that receptor dimerization in the absence of nanoclustering is unable to fully support CXCL12-mediated responses, including signaling and cell function in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Fidaxomicin is an antibacterial drug in clinical use for treatment of Clostridium difficile diarrhea. The active ingredient of fidaxomicin, lipiarmycin A3 (Lpm), functions by inhibiting bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here we report a cryo-EM structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNAP holoenzyme in complex with Lpm at 3.5-Å resolution. The structure shows that Lpm binds at the base of the RNAP “clamp.” The structure exhibits an open conformation of the RNAP clamp, suggesting that Lpm traps an open-clamp state. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments confirm that Lpm traps an open-clamp state and define effects of Lpm on clamp dynamics. We suggest that Lpm inhibits transcription by trapping an open-clamp state, preventing simultaneous interaction with promoter −10 and −35 elements. The results account for the absence of cross-resistance between Lpm and other RNAP inhibitors, account for structure-activity relationships of Lpm derivatives, and enable structure-based design of improved Lpm derivatives.

Abstract: Summary
Gene regulation is a complex non-equilibrium process. Here, we show that quantitating the temporal regulation of key gene states (transcriptionally inactive, active, and refractory) provides a parsimonious framework for analyzing gene regulation. Our theory makes two non-intuitive predictions. First, for transcription factors (TFs) that regulate transcription burst frequency, as opposed to amplitude or duration, weak TF binding is sufficient to elicit strong transcriptional responses. Second, refractoriness of a gene after a transcription burst enables rapid responses to stimuli. We validate both predictions experimentally by exploiting the natural, optogenetic-like responsiveness of the Neurospora GATA-type TF White Collar Complex (WCC) to blue light. Further, we demonstrate that differential regulation of WCC target genes is caused by different gene activation rates, not different TF occupancy, and that these rates are tuned by both the core promoter and the distance between TF-binding site and core promoter. In total, our work demonstrates the relevance of a kinetic, non-equilibrium framework for understanding transcriptional regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of cancer-associated alterations has primarily focused on genetic variants. Nonetheless, altered epigenomes contribute to deregulate transcription and promote oncogenic pathways. Here, we designed an algorithmic approach (RESET) to identify aberrant DNA methylation and associated cis-transcriptional changes across >6,000 human tumors. Tumors exhibiting mutations of chromatin remodeling factors and Wnt signaling displayed DNA methylation instability, characterized by numerous hyper- and hypo-methylated loci. Most silenced and enhanced genes coalesced in specific pathways including apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell metabolism. Cancer-germline antigens (CG) were frequently epigenomically enhanced and their expression correlated with response to anti-PD-1, but not anti-CTLA4, in skin melanoma. Finally, we demonstrated the potential of our approach to explore DNA methylation changes in pediatric tumors, which frequently lack genetic drivers and exhibit epigenomic modifications. Our results provide a pan-cancer map of aberrant DNA methylation to inform functional and therapeutic studies.
