Abstract: The RNA-binding protein Musashi2 (Msi2) has been identified as a master regulator within a variety of stem cell populations via the regulation of translational gene expression. A recent study has suggested that Msi2 is strongly expressed in leukemic cells of acute myeloid leukemia patients, and elevated Msi2 is associated with poor prognosis. However, the potential role of Msi2 in leukemogenesis is still not well understood. Here, we investigated the effect of Msi2 knockdown on the biological properties of leukemic cells. High expression of Msi2 was found in K562 and KG-1a leukemic cell lines, and low expression was observed in the U937 cell line. We transduced K562 cells with two independent adenoviral shRNA vectors targeting Msi2 and confirmed knockdown of Msi2 at the mRNA and protein levels. Msi2 silencing inhibited cell growth and caused cell cycle arrest by increasing the expression of p21 and decreasing the expression of cyclin D1 and cdk2. In addition, knockdown of Msi2 promoted cellular apoptosis via the upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, Msi2 knockdown resulted in the inactivation of the ERK/MAPK and p38/MAPK pathways, but no remarkable change in p-AKT was observed. These data provide evidence that Msi2 plays an important role in leukemogenesis involving the MAPK signaling pathway, which indicates that Msi2 may be a novel target for leukemia treatment.

Abstract: Mammalian hibernators survive low body temperatures, ischemia–reperfusion, and restricted nutritional resources via global reductions in energy-expensive cellular processes and selective increases in stress pathways. Consequently, studies that analyze hibernation uncover mechanisms which balance metabolism and support survival by enhancing stress tolerance. We hypothesized processing factors that influence messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) maturation and translation may play significant roles in hibernation. We characterized the amino acid sequences of three RNA processing proteins (T cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1), TIA1-related (TIAR), and poly(A)-binding proteins (PABP-1)) from thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), which all displayed a high degree of sequence identity with other mammals. Alternate Tia-1 and TiaR gene variants were found in the liver with higher expression of isoform b versus a in both cases. The localization of RNA-binding proteins to subnuclear structures was assessed by immunohistochemistry and confirmed by subcellular fractionation; TIA-1 was identified as a major component of subnuclear structures with up to a sevenfold increase in relative protein levels in the nucleus during hibernation. By contrast, there was no significant difference in the relative protein levels of TIARa/TIARb in the nucleus, and a decrease was observed for TIAR isoforms in cytoplasmic fractions of torpid animals. Finally, we used solubility tests to analyze the formation of reversible aggregates that are associated with TIA-1/R function during stress; a shift towards the soluble fraction (TIA-1a, TIA-1b) was observed during hibernation suggesting enhanced protein aggregation was not present during torpor. The present study identifies novel posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms that may play a role in reducing translational rates and/or mRNA processing under unfavorable environmental conditions.

Abstract: Expression of intracellular HSP70 is associated with cytoprotective effects against a wide range of stressful stimuli, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, hypoxia, endotoxins, infections, and fever. This cytoprotective effect is mainly attributed to their ability to stabilize protein structures through chaperone-like reversible interactions. HSP70 was recently detected in the extracellular medium, and its presence in serum is commonly associated with pathological situations, where it exerts modulatory effects on cells of the immune system. Previously, we have described the relationship between serum HSP70 levels, oxidant status, and clinical outcome of septic patients; the group of patients with higher prooxidant status and higher serum HSP70 had also higher mortality. To investigate the possible association between oxidized HSP70 and cytoprotection or cell death, we incubated RAW 264.7 macrophages with oxidized HSP70 and evaluated nitrite production, cell proliferation, cell viability, TNF-α release, and phagocytic activity. We also evaluated structural modifications caused by oxidation in purified HSP70. Oxidation of HSP70 altered its protein structure; besides, the modulatory effect of oxidized HSP70 on RAW264.7 cells was different from that of native HSP70. Macrophages treated with oxidized HSP70 presented lower proliferation and viability, lower phagocytic activity, and lower TNF-α release. These results indicate that oxidation of extracellular HSP70 modified its signaling properties, causing alterations on its modulatory effects on macrophage function and viability.

Abstract: Summary
We describe the use of a characteristic blue fluorescence to identify and isolate pluripotent human embryonic stem cells and human-induced pluripotent stem cells. The blue fluorescence emission (450–500 nm) is readily observed by fluorescence microscopy and correlates with the expression of pluripotency markers (OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG). It allows easy identification and isolation of undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells, high-throughput fluorescence sorting and subsequent propagation. The fluorescence appears early during somatic reprogramming. We show that the blue fluorescence arises from the sequestration of retinyl esters in cytoplasmic lipid bodies. The retinoid-sequestering lipid bodies are specific to human and mouse pluripotent stem cells of the primed or epiblast-like state and absent in naive mouse embryonic stem cells. Retinol, present in widely used stem cell culture media, is sequestered as retinyl ester specifically by primed pluripotent cells and also can induce the formation of these lipid bodies.

Abstract: The mammalian cerebral cortex develops through the coordinated migration of postmitotic neurons. Fyn, a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family (SFKs), is involved in the neuronal migration and the absence of Fyn leads to abnormal migration. However, the molecular mechanism whereby Fyn acts on migrating neurons has remained unclear. Here, we employed two Fyn mutants (Fyn259T and FynD390A) to investigate the function of Fyn kinase domain in neuronal migration. Using in utero electroporation, we co-transfected the migrating neurons in embryonic cortex with these mutants combined with plasmid expressing GFP. Interestingly, although both of them impaired neuronal migration, FynD390A, rather than Fyn259T, induced remarkable morphology change. Our work provides in vivo and in vitro evidence that the aspartic acid of Fyn at 390 is indispensable for the radial migration, and it is required for precise cooperation with focal adhesion kinase.

Abstract: RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling has been suggested to be involved in diabetic nephropathy (DN) pathogenesis. Altered expression of connexin43 (Cx43) has been found in kidneys of diabetic animals. Both of them have been found to regulate nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) activation in high glucose-treated glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between RhoA/ROCK signaling and Cx43 in the DN pathogenesis. We found that upregulation of Cx43 expression inhibited NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation induced by RhoA/ROCK signaling in GMCs. Inhibition of RhoA/ROCK signaling attenuated the high glucose-induced decrease in Cx43. F-actin accumulation and an enhanced interaction between zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and Cx43 were observed in high glucose-treated GMCs. ZO-1 depletion or disruption of F-actin formation also inhibited the reduction in Cx43 protein levels induced by high glucose. In conclusion, activated RhoA/ROCK signaling induces Cx43 degradation in GMCs cultured in high glucose, depending on F-actin regulation. Increased F-actin induced by RhoA/ROCK signaling promotes the association between ZO-1 and Cx43, which possibly triggered Cx43 endocytosis, a mechanism of NF-κB activation in high glucose-treated GMCs.

Abstract: The role of EGF and TGF-β1 in thyroid cancer is still not clearly defined. TGF-β1 inhibited the cellular growth and migration of follicular (FTC-133) and papillary (B-CPAP) thyroid carcinoma cell lines. Co-treatments of TGF-β1 and EGF inhibited proliferation in both cell lines, but displayed opposite effect on their migratory capability, leading to inhibition in B-CPAP and promotion in FTC-133 cells, by a MAPK-dependent mechanism. TGF-β1, TβRII and EGFR expressions were evaluated in benign and malignant thyroid tumors. Both positivity (51.7% and 60.0% and 80.0% in FA and PTC and FTC) and overexpression (60.0%, 77.7% and 75.0% in FA, PTC and FTC) of EGFR mRNA correlates with the aggressive tumor behavior. The moderate overexpression of TGF-β1 and TβRII mRNA in PTC tissues (61.5% and 62.5%, respectively), counteracted their high overexpression in FTC tissues (100% and 100%, respectively), while EGFR overexpression was similar in both carcinomas. Papillary carcinomas were positive to E-cadherin expression, while the follicular carcinomas lose E-cadherin staining. Our findings of TGF-β1/TβRII and EGFR overexpressions together with a loss of E-cadherin observed in human follicular thyroid carcinomas, and of increased migration ability MAPK-dependent after EGF/TGF-β1 treatments in the follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line, reinforced the hypothesis of a cross-talk between EGF and TGF-β1 systems in follicular thyroid carcinomas phenotype.

Abstract: Alterations in the structure of cell surface glycoforms occurring during the stages of stem cell differentiation remain unclear. We describe a rapid glycoblotting-based cellular glycomics method for quantitatively evaluating changes in glycoform expression and structure during neuronal differentiation of murine induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Our results show that changes in the expression of cellular N-glycans are comparable during the differentiation of iPSCs and ESCs. The expression of bisect-type N-glycans was significantly up-regulated in neurons that differentiated from both iPSCs and ESCs. From a glycobiological standpoint, iPSCs are an alternative neural cell source in addition to ESCs.

Abstract: Summary
During invasion of host cells by Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, the elongated, flagellated trypomastigotes remodel into oval amastigotes with no external flagellum. The underlying mechanism of this remodeling and the fate of the flagellum are obscure. We discovered that T. cruzi trypomastigotes discard their flagella via an asymmetric cellular division. The flagellar proteins liberated become among the earliest parasite proteins to enter the MHC-I processing pathway in infected cells. Indeed, paraflagellar rod protein PAR4-specific CD8+ T cells detect infected host cells >20 hr earlier than immunodominant trans-sialidase-specific T cells. Overexpression of PAR4 in T. cruzi enhanced the subdominant PAR4-specific CD8+ T cell response, resulting in improved control of a challenge infection. These results provide insights into previously unappreciated events in intracellular invasion by T. cruzi and highlight the importance of T cells that recognize infected host cells early in the infectious process, in the control of infections.

Abstract: Summary
Utilizing human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in cell-based therapy and drug discovery requires large-scale cell production. However, scaling up conventional adherent cultures presents challenges of maintaining a uniform high quality at low cost. In this regard, suspension cultures are a viable alternative, because they are scalable and do not require adhesion surfaces. 3D culture systems such as bioreactors can be exploited for large-scale production. However, the limitations of current suspension culture methods include spontaneous fusion between cell aggregates and suboptimal passaging methods by dissociation and reaggregation. 3D culture systems that dynamically stir carrier beads or cell aggregates should be refined to reduce shearing forces that damage hPSCs. Here, we report a simple 3D sphere culture system that incorporates mechanical passaging and functional polymers. This setup resolves major problems associated with suspension culture methods and dynamic stirring systems and may be optimal for applications involving large-scale hPSC production.

Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a recently developed antitumor modality utilizing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), through light irradiation of photosensitizers (PSs) localized in tumor. Interference with proper functioning of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by ER-targeting PDT is a newly proposed strategy to achieve tumor cell death. The aim of this study is to establish a multifunctional model to screen and assess ER-targeting PSs based on luciferase reporters system. Upregulation of GRP78 is a biomarker for the onset of ER stress. CHOP is a key initiating player in ER stress-induced cell death. Here, the most sensitive fragments of GRP78 and CHOP promoters responding to ER-targeting PDT were mapped and cloned into pGL3-basic vector, forming −702/GRP78-Luc and −443/CHOP-Luc construct, respectively. We demonstrated that −702/GRP78-Luc expression can be used to indicate the ER-targeting of PSs, meanwhile estimate the ROS level induced by low-dose ER-targeting PDT. Moreover, the luciferase signaling of −443/CHOP-Luc showed highly consistence with apoptosis rate caused by ER-targeting PDT, suggesting that −443/CHOP-Luc can evaluate the antitumor properties of PSs. Hypericin, Foscan® and methylene blue were applied to verify the sensitivity and reliability of our model. These results proved that GRP78-CHOP model may be suitable to screen ER-targeting photosensitive compounds with lower cost and higher sensitivity than traditional ways.

Abstract: Though expression of the homeobox transcription factor Nanog is generally restricted to pluripotent cells and early germ cells, many contradictory reports about Nanog's involvement in tumorigenesis exist. To address this, a modified Tet-On system was utilized to generate Nanog-inducible mice. Following prolonged Nanog expression, phenotypic alterations were found to be restricted to the intestinal tract, leaving other major organs unaffected. Intestinal and colonic epithelium hyperplasia was observed—intestinal villi had doubled in length and hyperplastic epithelium outgrowths were seen after 7days. Increased proliferation of crypt cells and downregulation of the tumor suppressors Cdx2 and Klf4 was detected. ChIP analysis showed physical interaction of Nanog with the Cdx2 and Klf4 promoters, indicating a regulatory conservation from embryonic development. Despite downregulation of tumor suppressors and increased proliferation, ectopic Nanog expression did not lead to tumor formation. We conclude that unlike other pluripotency-related transcription factors, Nanog cannot be considered an oncogene.

Abstract: Water loss either by desiccation or freezing causes multiple forms of cellular damage. The encysted embryos (cysts) of the crustacean Artemia franciscana have several molecular mechanisms to enable anhydrobiosis—life without water—during diapause. To better understand how cysts survive reduced hydration, group 1 late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, hydrophilic unstructured proteins that accumulate in the stress-tolerant cysts of A. franciscana, were knocked down using RNA interference (RNAi). Embryos lacking group 1 LEA proteins showed significantly lower survival than control embryos after desiccation and freezing, or freezing alone, demonstrating a role for group 1 LEA proteins in A. franciscana tolerance of low water conditions. In contrast, regardless of group 1 LEA protein presence, cysts responded similarly to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposure, indicating little to no function for these proteins in diapause termination. This is the first in vivo study of group 1 LEA proteins in an animal and it contributes to the fundamental understanding of these proteins. Knowing how LEA proteins protect A. franciscana cysts from desiccation and freezing may have applied significance in aquaculture, where Artemia is an important feed source, and in the cryopreservation of cells for therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Recent evidences indicated Nrf2 is more potent than Nrf1 in the activation of antioxidant genes. However, the roles of Nrf proteins in the regulation of copper-responsive transcription have not been well addressed. We took the toxicogenomic approach and the present network and Gene Ontology analyses results showed that Nrf1 and Nrf2 are distinctively involved in copper-responsive transcriptional regulation in HepG2 transcriptome. Cells deficient in either Nrf1 or Nrf2 were more susceptible to copper exposure than wild type cells. Nrf1 and Nrf2 null cells were transfected with the luciferase reporters containing either ARE(s) or a combination of ARE(s) and MREs, and then treated with copper. In Nrf2-null (Nrf2−/−) cells, copper did not activate transcription of reporter genes, whereas Nrf1 deficiency did not affect copper-inducible activation. Ectopic expression of Nrf2 restored copper-inducible transcription in Nrf2−/− cells. However, the changes in the intrinsic mRNA levels of MT-1 in Nrf null cells following copper treatment showed that Nrf1 and Nrf2 equally contributed to MT-1 activation after 4h, while Nrf1involved more than Nrf2 following 24h exposure. These results suggest that while Nrf2 is crucial for MRE/ARE-mediated transcription in response to copper, Nrf1 may activate MT-1 expression by a mechanism different from that Nrf2 employs.

Abstract: During our research on apelin receptor (APJ) signalling in living cells with BRET and FRET, we demonstrated that apelin-13 stimulation can lead to the activation of Gαi2 or Gαi3 through undergoing a molecular rearrangement rather than dissociation in HEK293 cells expressing APJ. Furthermore, Gαo and Gαq also showed involvement in APJ activation through a classical dissociation model. However, both FRET signal and BRET ratio between fluorescent Gαi1 subunit and Gβγ subunits demonstrated little change after apelin-13 stimulation. These results demonstrated that stimulation of APJ with apelin-13 causes activation of Gαi2, Gαi3, Gαo, Gαq; among which Gαi2, Gαi3 were activated through a novel rearrangement process. These results provide helpful data for understanding APJ mediated G-protein signalling.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stromal cells have shown clinical promise; however, variations in treatment responses are an ongoing concern. We previously demonstrated that MSCs are functionally stunned after thawing. Here, we investigated whether this cryopreservation/thawing defect also impacts the postinfusion biodistribution properties of MSCs. Under both static and physiologic flow, compared with live MSCs in active culture, MSCs thawed from cryopreservation bound poorly to fibronectin (40% reduction) and human endothelial cells (80% reduction), respectively. This reduction correlated with a reduced cytoskeletal F-actin content in post-thaw MSCs (60% reduction). In vivo, live human MSCs could be detected in murine lung tissues for up to 24 hr, whereas thawed MSCs were undetectable. Similarly, live MSCs whose actin cytoskeleton was chemically disrupted were undetectable at 24 hr postinfusion. Our data suggest that post-thaw cryopreserved MSCs are distinct from live MSCs. This distinction could significantly affect the utility of MSCs as a cellular therapeutic.

Abstract: Chondrocytes rapidly lose their phenotypic expression of collagen II and aggrecan when grown on 2D substrates. It has generally been observed that a fibroblastic morphology with strong actin–myosin contractility inhibits chondrogenesis, whereas chondrogenesis may be promoted by depolymerization of the stress fibers and/or disruption of the physical link between the actin stress fibers and the ECM, as is the case in 3D hydrogels. Here we studied the relationship between the actin–myosin cytoskeleton and expression of chondrogenic markers by culturing fibroblastic chondrocytes in the presence of cytochalasin D and staurosporine. Both drugs induced collagen II re-expression; however, renewed glycosaminoglycan synthesis could only be observed upon treatment with staurosporine. The chondrogenic effect of staurosporine was augmented when blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin/actin contractility, was added to the staurosporine-stimulated cultures. Furthermore, in 3D alginate cultures, the amount of staurosporine required to induce chondrogenesis was much lower compared to 2D cultures (0.625nM vs. 2.5nM). Using a selection of specific signaling pathway inhibitors, it was found that PI3K-, PKC- and p38-MAPK pathways positively regulated chondrogenesis while the ERK-pathway was found to be a negative regulator in staurosporine-induced re-differentiation, whereas down-regulation of ILK by siRNA indicated that ILK is not determining for chondrocyte re-differentiation. Furthermore, staurosporine analog midostaurin displayed only a limited chondrogenic effect, suggesting that activation/deactivation of a specific set of key signaling molecules can control the expression of the chondrogenic phenotype. This study demonstrates the critical importance of mechanobiological factors in chondrogenesis suggesting that the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton and its contractility control key signaling molecules that determine whether the chondrocyte phenotype will be directed along a fibroblastic or chondrogenic path.

Abstract: Summary
Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) play a critical role in T cell maturation and tolerance induction. The generation of TECs from in vitro differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) provides a platform on which to study the mechanisms of this interaction and has implications for immune reconstitution. To facilitate analysis of PSC-derived TECs, we generated hESC reporter lines in which sequences encoding GFP were targeted to FOXN1, a gene required for TEC development. Using this FOXN1GFP/w line as a readout, we developed a reproducible protocol for generating FOXN1-GFP+ thymic endoderm cells. Transcriptional profiling and flow cytometry identified integrin-β4 (ITGB4, CD104) and HLA-DR as markers that could be used in combination with EpCAM to selectively purify FOXN1+ TEC progenitors from differentiating cultures of unmanipulated PSCs. Human FOXN1+ TEC progenitors generated from PSCs facilitate the study of thymus biology and are a valuable resource for future applications in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: In order to evaluate the functional significance of palmitoylation during multi-potent neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, retinoic acid-induced P19 cells were used in this study as a model system. Cell behaviour was monitored in the presence of the protein palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (2BP). Here, we observed a significant reduction in neuronal differentiation in the 2BP-treated cell model. We further explored the underlying mechanisms and found that 2BP resulted in the decreased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and interfered with cell cycle withdrawal and neural stem/progenitor cells' renewal. Our results established a direct link between palmitoylation and the regulation of neural cell fate specification and revealed the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that are involved in the effects of palmitoylation during neural development.

Abstract: Celiac disease (CD) is a small intestinal enteropathy, triggered in susceptible individuals by the ingestion of dietary gluten. Dendritic cells (DC) are instrumental in the generation and regulation of immune responses and oversee intestinal immune homeostasis promoting and maintaining oral tolerance to food antigens. The aim of this study was to monitor the effect of peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin (PT-gliadin) on the maturation of human monocyte-derived DC and the impact of pDAV and pRPQ decapeptides in the modulation of PT-gliadin-induced phenotypic and functional DC maturation. Immature DC (iDC) were challenged in vitro with PT-gliadin. In some experiments iDC were pre-treated with pDAV or pRPQ and after 2h PT-gliadin was added to the cultures. We found that PT-gliadin up-regulates the expression of the maturation markers HLA-DR, CD83, CD80 and CD86. The functional consequence of PT-gliadin treatment of iDC is a significant increase in IL-12, TNF-alpha production as well as in their T cell stimulatory capacity. On the contrary, the digest of zein had no effect on DC maturation. Interestingly, we found that pre-treatment of iDC with pDAV or pRPQ decapeptides significantly prevents the functional maturation of DC induced by PT-gliadin. On the other hand, pDAV and pRPQ did not revert the PT-gliadin-induced phenotypic maturation of DC. Here we report, for the first time, that naturally occurring peptides are able to prevent the gliadin-dependent DC maturation. This finding could have implication for CD, raising the perspective of a potential therapeutic strategy alternative to a gluten free diet.

Abstract: Both BMP and Wnt signaling control stem cells in bulge/dermal papilla, intestinal crypt, and bone marrow. To explore their roles in the limbal niche, which govern corneal epithelial homeostasis, we established an in vitro model of sphere growth by reunion between single limbal epithelial progenitor cells (LEPCs) and aggregates of limbal niche cells (LNCs) in 3D Matrigel. Compared to LEPCs alone, spheres formed by LEPC+LNC exhibited higher clonal growth and less corneal epithelial differentiation. Furthermore, pSmad1/5/8 was in the nucleus of LEPCs, but not LNCs, and correlated with upregulation of BMP1, BMP3, BMP4, all three BMP receptors, and BMP target genes. Inactivation of BMP signaling in LNCs was correlated with upregulation of noggin preferentially expressed by LNCs. Additionally, β-catenin was stabilized in the perinuclear cytoplasm in LEPCs and correlated with upregulation of Wnt7A and FZD5 preferentially expressed by LEPCs. Inactivation of Wnt signaling in LNCs was correlated with upregulation of DKK1/2 by LNCs. Addition of XAV939 that expectedly downregulated perinuclear β-catenin in LEPCs led to significant reduction of epithelial clonal growth, but upregulated all three BMP receptors and downregulated LNC-derived noggin, resulting in activation of BMP signaling in LNCs. Addition of noggin that expectedly downregulated nuclear localization of pSmad1/5/8 in LEPCs led to nuclear localization of β-catenin in larger LEPCs but membrane relocation of β-catenin in smaller LEPCs and significant upregulation of DKK1/2. Hence, balancing acts between Wnt signaling and BMP signaling exist not only within LEPCs but also between LEPCs and LNCs to regulate clonal growth of LEPCs.

Abstract: Summary
Dengue virus (DENV) infection induces the expansion of plasmablasts, which produce antibodies that can neutralize DENV but also enhance disease upon secondary infection with another DENV serotype. To understand how these immune responses are generated, we used a systems biological approach to analyze immune responses to dengue in humans. Transcriptomic analysis of whole blood revealed that genes encoding proinflammatory mediators and type I interferon-related proteins were associated with high DENV levels during initial symptomatic disease. Additionally, CD14+CD16+ monocytes increased in the blood. Similarly, in a nonhuman primate model, DENV infection boosted CD14+CD16+ monocyte numbers in the blood and lymph nodes. Upon DENV infection in vitro, monocytes upregulated CD16 and mediated differentiation of resting B cells to plasmablasts as well as immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM secretion. These findings provide a detailed picture of innate responses to dengue and highlight a role for CD14+CD16+ monocytes in promoting plasmablast differentiation and anti-DENV antibody responses.

Abstract: Summary
While conceptual principles governing plant immunity are becoming clear, its systems-level organization and the evolutionary dynamic of the host-pathogen interface are still obscure. We generated a systematic protein-protein interaction network of virulence effectors from the ascomycete pathogen Golovinomyces orontii and Arabidopsis thaliana host proteins. We combined this data set with corresponding data for the eubacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and the oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. The resulting network identifies host proteins onto which intraspecies and interspecies pathogen effectors converge. Phenotyping of 124 Arabidopsis effector-interactor mutants revealed a correlation between intraspecies and interspecies convergence and several altered immune response phenotypes. Several effectors and the most heavily targeted host protein colocalized in subnuclear foci. Products of adaptively selected Arabidopsis genes are enriched for interactions with effector targets. Our data suggest the existence of a molecular host-pathogen interface that is conserved across Arabidopsis accessions, while evolutionary adaptation occurs in the immediate network neighborhood of effector targets.

Abstract: Summary
Listeria monocytogenes infected CD8α+ DCs in the spleen are essential for CD8+ T cell generation. CD8α+ DCs are also necessary for Listeria expansion and dissemination within the host. The mechanisms that regulate CD8α+ DCs to allow Listeria expansion are unclear. We find that activating the B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), a coinhibitory receptor for T cells, suppresses, while blocking BTLA enhances, both the primary and memory CD8 T cell responses against Listeria. Btla−/− mice have lower effector and memory CD8+ T cells while paradoxically also being more resistant to Listeria. Although bacterial entry into Btla−/− CD8α+ DCs is unaffected, Listeria fails to expand within these cells. BTLA signaling limits Fas/FasL-mediated suppression of Listeria expansion within CD8α+ DCs to more effectively alert adaptive immune cells. This study uncovers a BTLA-mediated strategy used by the host that permits Listeria proliferation to enable increasing T cell responses for long-term protection.

Abstract: Bone homeostasis is maintained by the balance between osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption. In this study, we used human bone marrow cells (BMCs) to investigate the role of hypoxic exposure on human osteoclast (OC) formation in the presence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Exposing the BMCs to 3%, 5%, or 10% O2 in the presence of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) generated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinuclear cells, consistent with OCs. The addition of TNF under hypoxic conditions generated significantly greater numbers of mature OCs with more nuclei than OCs generated under normoxic conditions. Longer initial hypoxic exposure increased the number of OC precursor cells and facilitated the differentiation of OC precursor cells into multinucleated OCs. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that RANKL and TNFR1 were expressed at higher levels in non-OC cells from BMCs under hypoxic conditions than under normoxic conditions. Furthermore, to confirm the involvement of TNF-induced signaling, we examined the effects of blocking antibodies against TNFR1 and TNFR2 on OC formation under hypoxic conditions. The TNFR1 antibody was observed to significantly suppress OC formation. These results suggest that hypoxic exposure plays an important role in TNF-induced osteoclastogenesis from human BMCs.

Abstract: Summary
Similar to other positive-strand RNA viruses, rhinovirus, the causative agent of the common cold, replicates on a web of cytoplasmic membranes, orchestrated by host proteins and lipids. The host pathways that facilitate the formation and function of the replication membranes and complexes are poorly understood. We show that rhinovirus replication depends on host factors driving phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P)-cholesterol counter-currents at viral replication membranes. Depending on the virus type, replication required phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase class 3beta (PI4K3b), cholesteryl-esterase hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) or oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-like 1, 2, 5, 9, or 11 associated with lipid droplets, endosomes, or Golgi. Replication invariably required OSBP1, which shuttles cholesterol and PI4P between ER and Golgi at membrane contact sites. Infection also required ER-associated PI4P phosphatase Sac1 and phosphatidylinositol (PI) transfer protein beta (PITPb) shunting PI between ER-Golgi. These data support a PI4P-cholesterol counter-flux model for rhinovirus replication.

Abstract: The regenerative potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is impaired by cellular senescence, a multi factorial process that has various functions. However, pathways and molecules involved in senescence have not been fully identified. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) has been the subject of intensive research, due to its contribution to many physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The implication of Lcn2 has been reported in many conditions where senescence also occurs. In the present study, we evaluated the role of Lcn2 in the occurrence of senescence in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hB-MSCs) under oxidative conditions. When hB-MSCs were genetically engineered to over-express Lcn2 (MSC-Lcn2) and exposed to H2O2, the proliferation rate of the cells increased. However, the number of colonies and the number of cells that made up each colony in both MSC-V and MSC-Lcn2 cells decreased compared to those cultivated under normal conditions. Our results revealed that over-expression of recombinant Lcn2 in hB-MSCs decreases senescence induced by H2O2 treatment. Senescent cells were observed in aged hB-MSCs; however, no alteration in the expression level of Lcn2 was detected compared to earlier passages. Finally, a higher amount of Lcn2 protein was detected in the plasma of the elderly than in young people. Our findings suggest that Lcn2 might restore the health and regeneration potential of MSCs by decreasing senescence.

Abstract: The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is dismal due to the frequent metastasis and invasion to surrounding organs. Numerous molecules are involved in the malignant behavior of pancreatic cancer cells, but the entire process remains unclear. Several reports have suggested that CUB-domain containing protein-1 (CDCP1) is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer, but its impact on the invasive growth and the upstream regulator remain elusive. To clarify the role of CDCP1 in pancreatic cancer, we here examined the effects of CDCP1 knockdown on the cell behaviors of pancreatic cancer cells. Knockdown of CDCP1 expression in Panc-1 resulted in reduced cellular migration accompanied by the increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of N-cadherin. Knockdown of CDCP1 attenuated the spheroid formation and resistance against gemcitabine, which are some of the cancer stem cell-related phenotypes. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) was found to induce CDCP1 expression via the extracellular signal regulated kinase pathway, suggesting that CDCP1 has a substantial role in the BMP4-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results indicate that CDCP1 represses the epithelial phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells.

Abstract: Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is required for numerous developmental processes including specification of ventral cell types in the central nervous system such as midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. The multifunctional coreceptor Cdo increases the signaling activity of Shh which is crucial for development of forebrain and neural tube. In this study, we investigated the role of Cdo in midbrain DA neurogenesis. Cdo and Shh signaling components are induced during neurogenesis of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Cdo−/− ES cells show reduced neuronal differentiation accompanied by increased cell death upon neuronal induction. In addition, Cdo−/− ES cells form fewer tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2)-positive DA neurons correlating with the decreased expression of key regulators of DA neurogenesis, such as Shh, Neurogenin2, Mash1, Foxa2, Lmx1a, Nurr1 and Pitx3, relative to the Cdo+/+ ES cells. Consistently, the Cdo−/− embryonic midbrain displays a reduction in expression of TH and Nurr1. Furthermore, activation of Shh signaling by treatment with Purmorphamine (Pur) restores the DA neurogenesis of Cdo−/− ES cells, suggesting that Cdo is required for the full Shh signaling activation to induce efficient DA neurogenesis.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is notoriously resistant to radiation, and consequently, new radiosensitizers are urgently needed. MicroRNAs are a class of endogenous gene modulators with emerging roles in DNA repair. We found that overexpression of miR-26a can enhance radiosensitivity and reduce the DNA repair ability of U87 cells. However, knockdown miR-26a in U87 cells could act the converse manner. Mechanistically, this effect is mediated by direct targeting of miR-26a to the 3′UTR of ATM, which leads to reduced ATM levels and consequent inhibition of the homologous recombination repair pathway. These results suggest that miR-26a may act as a new radiosensitizer of GBM.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cold stress on oxidative indexes, immune function, and the expression levels of heat shock protein (Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp60, Hsp40, and Hsp27) in immune organs of chickens. Two hundred forty 15-day-old male chickens were randomly divided into 12 groups and kept under the temperature of (12 ± 1) °C for acute and chronic cold stress. There were one control group and five treatment groups for acute cold stress and three control groups and three treatment groups for chronic cold stress. The results showed that cold stress influence the activities of antioxidant enzymes in the immune organs. The activities of SOD and GSH-Px were first increased then decreased, and activity of total antioxidation capacity (T-AOC) was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) at the acute cold stress in chicks; however, T-AOC activities were significantly increased (P < 0.05) at the chronic cold stress in these tissues. Cold stress induced higher level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in chicken immune organs. In addition, the cytokine contents were increased in cold stress groups. As one protective factor, the expression levels of Hsps were increased significantly (P < 0.05) in both cold stress groups. These results suggested that cold stress induced the oxidative stress in the three tissues and influenced immune function of chicks. Higher expression of Hsps (Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp60, Hsp40, and Hsp27) may play a role in protecting immune organs against cold stress.

Abstract: Neutrophils express several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and they cross regulate each other. We described a novel cross-talk mechanism in neutrophils, by which signals generated by the receptor for ATP (P2Y2) reactivate desensitized formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) so that these ligand-bound inactive FPRs resume signaling. At the signaling level, the cross-talk was unidirectional, i.e., P2Y2 ligation reactivated FPR, but not vice versa and was sensitive to the phosphatase inhibitor calyculinA. Further, we show that the cross talk between P2Y2 and FPR bypassed cytosolic Ca2+ transients and did not rely on the actin cytoskeleton. In summary, our data demonstrate a novel cross-talk mechanism that results in reactivation of desensitized FPRs and, an amplification of the neutrophil response to ATP.

Abstract: We investigated if the antileukemic drug idarubicin induces autophagy, a process of programmed cellular self-digestion, in leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic cells. Transmission electron microscopy and acridine orange staining demonstrated the presence of autophagic vesicles and intracellular acidification, respectively, in idarubicin-treated REH leukemic cell line. Idarubicin increased punctuation/aggregation of microtubule-associated light chain 3B (LC3B), enhanced the conversion of LC3B-I to autophagosome-associated LC3B-II in the presence of proteolysis inhibitors, and promoted the degradation of the selective autophagic target p62, thus indicating the increase in autophagic flux. Idarubicin inhibited the phosphorylation of the main autophagy repressor mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream target p70S6 kinase. The treatment with the mTOR activator leucine prevented idarubicin-mediated autophagy induction. Idarubicin-induced mTOR repression was associated with the activation of the mTOR inhibitor AMP-activated protein kinase and down-regulation of the mTOR activator Akt. The suppression of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitors or LC3B and beclin-1 genetic knockdown rescued REH cells from idarubicin-mediated oxidative stress, mitochondrial depolarization, caspase activation and apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Idarubicin also caused mTOR inhibition and cytotoxic autophagy in K562 leukemic cell line and leukocytes from chronic myeloid leukemia patients, but not healthy controls. By demonstrating mTOR-dependent cytotoxic autophagy in idarubicin-treated leukemic cells, our results warrant caution when considering combining idarubicin with autophagy inhibitors in leukemia therapy.

Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is a motor neuron disease caused by mutations in the IGHMBP2 gene, without a cure. Here, we demonstrate that neural stem cells (NSCs) from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have therapeutic potential in the context of SMARD1. We show that upon transplantation NSCs can appropriately engraft and differentiate in the spinal cord of SMARD1 animals, ameliorating their phenotype, by protecting their endogenous motor neurons. To evaluate the effect of NSCs in the context of human disease, we generated human SMARD1-iPSCs motor neurons that had a significantly reduced survival and axon length. Notably, the coculture with NSCs ameliorate these disease features, an effect attributable to the production of neurotrophic factors and their dual inhibition of GSK-3 and HGK kinases. Our data support the role of iPSC as SMARD1 disease model and their translational potential for therapies in motor neuron disorders.

Abstract: Clinically aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) is linked to androgen resistance, metastasis, and expression of neuroendocrine markers. To understand mechanism(s) of neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) of PCa epithelia, we compared neuronal differentiation occurring during embryogenesis, in primary cultures of neural crest (NC) cells, and NED in PCa cell lines (LNCaP and PC3). We demonstrate, hypoxia promotes neuronal and neuroendocrine differentiation of NC cells and PCa cells, respectively, by inducing the miR-106b~25 cluster. In turn, miR-106b~25 comprised of miR-106b, miR-93 and miR-25, down-regulates the transcriptional repressor REST, which represses neuron-specific protein-coding and miRNA genes. In prostate tumors of high Gleason score (≥8), an inverse trend was observed between REST and miR-106b~25 induction. Employing miRNA PCR arrays, we identified miRNAs up-regulated by hypoxia in LNCaP cells and REST-knockdown in NC cells. Significantly, a subset of miRNAs (miR-9, miR-25, miR-30d and miR302b) is up-regulated in high Gleason score (≥8) PCa, suggesting a mechanism by which NED contributes to PCa malignancy. We propose that loss of REST and induction of this set of microRNAs can serve as potential novel clinical markers of advanced PCa.

Abstract: Summary
Resident neural precursor cells (NPCs) have been reported for a number of adult tissues. Understanding their physiological function or, alternatively, their activation after tissue damage or in vitro manipulation remains an unsolved issue. Here, we investigated the source of human dermal NPCs in adult tissue. By following an unbiased, comprehensive approach employing cell-surface marker screening, cell separation, transcriptomic characterization, and in vivo fate analyses, we found that p75NTR+ precursors of human foreskin can be ascribed to the Schwann (CD56+) and perivascular (CD56−) cell lineages. Moreover, neural differentiation potential was restricted to the p75NTR+CD56+ Schwann cells and mediated by SOX2 expression levels. Double-positive NPCs were similarly obtained from human cardiospheres, indicating that this phenomenon might be widespread.

Abstract: Summary
The NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 is involved in chromatin silencing and genome stability. Elevated SIRT1 levels in embryonic stem cells also suggest a role for SIRT1 in pluripotency. Murine SIRT1 attenuates telomere attrition in vivo and is recruited at telomeres in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Because telomere elongation is an iPSC hallmark, we set out to study the role of SIRT1 in pluripotency in the setting of murine embryonic fibroblasts reprogramming into iPSCs. We find that SIRT1 is required for efficient postreprogramming telomere elongation, and that this effect is mediated by a c-MYC-dependent regulation of the mTert gene. We further demonstrate that SIRT1-deficient iPSCs accumulate chromosomal aberrations and show a derepression of telomeric heterochromatin. Finally, SIRT1-deficient iPSCs form larger teratomas that are poorly differentiated, highlighting a role for SIRT1 in exit from pluripotency. In summary, this work demonstrates a role for SIRT1 in the maintenance of pluripotency and modulation of differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) acquire embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like epigenetic states, including the X chromosome. Previous studies reported that human iPSCs retain the inactive X chromosome of parental cells, or acquire two active X chromosomes through reprogramming. Most studies investigated the X chromosome states in established human iPSC clones after completion of reprogramming. Thus, it is still not fully understood when and how the X chromosome reactivation occurs during reprogramming. Here, we report a dynamic change in the X chromosome state throughout reprogramming, with an initial robust reactivation of the inactive X chromosome followed by an inactivation upon generation of nascent iPSC clones. iPSCs with two active X chromosomes or an eroded X chromosome arise in passaging iPSCs. These data provide important insights into the plasticity of the X chromosome of human female iPSCs and will be crucial for the future application of such cells in cell therapy and X-linked disease modeling.

Abstract: Temperature-induced conformational changes of reduced and oxidized HspB1 crosslinked by disulfide bond between single Cys137 of neighboring monomers were analyzed by means of different techniques. Heating of reduced HspB1 was accompanied by irreversible changes of Trp fluorescence, whereas oxidized HspB1 underwent completely reversible changes of fluorescence. Increase of the temperature in the range of 20–70°C was accompanied by self-association of both reduced and oxidized protein. Further increase of the temperature led to formation of heterogeneous mixture of large self-associated complexes of reduced HspB1 and to formation of smaller and less heterogeneous complexes of oxidized HspB1. Heat-induced changes of oligomeric state of reduced HspB1 were only partially reversible, whereas the corresponding changes of oligomeric state of oxidized HspB1 were almost completely reversible. Oxidation resulted in decrease of chaperone-like activity of HspB1. It is concluded that oxidative stress, inducing formation of disulfide bond, can affect stability and conformational mobility of human HspB1.

Abstract: Contact guidance is a cellular phenomenon observed during wound healing and developmental patterning, in which adherent cells align in the same direction due to physical cues. Despite numerous studies, the molecular mechanism underlying the consistent cell orientation is poorly understood. Here we fabricated microgrooves with a pitch of submicrons to study contact guidance of smooth muscle cells. We show that both integrin-based cell–substrate adhesions and cellular tension are necessary to achieve contact guidance along microgrooves. We further show through analyses on paxillin that cell–substrate adhesions are more prone to become mature when they run along microgrooves than align at an angle to the direction of microgrooves. Because cellular tension promotes the maturation of cell–substrate adhesions, we propose that the adhesions aligning across microgrooves are not physically efficient for bearing cellular tension compared to those aligning along microgrooves. Thus, the proposed model describes a mechanism of contact guidance that cells would finally align preferentially along microgrooves because cellular tensions are more easily borne within the direction, and the direction of resulting mature adhesions determines the direction of the whole cells.

Abstract: Due to the limitations in the clinical application of embryonic stem cells (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are now much more interesting for cell-based therapy. Although MSCs have several advantages, they are not capable of differentiating to all three embryonic layers (three germ layers) without cultivation under specific induction media. Hence, improvement of MSCs for cell therapy purposes is under intensive study now. In this study, we isolated MSCs from umbilical cord tissue at the single-cell level, by treatment with trypsin, followed by cultivation under suspension conditions to form a colony. These colonies were trypsin resistant, capable of self-renewal differentiation to the three germ layers without any induction, and they were somewhat similar to ESC colonies. The cells were able to grow in both adherent and suspension culture conditions, expressed both the MSCs markers, especially CD105, and the multipotency markers, i.e., SSEA-3, and had a limited lifespan. The cells were expanded under simple culture conditions at the single-cell level and were homogenous. Further and complementary studies are required to understand how trypsin-tolerant mesenchymal stem cells are established. However, our study suggested non-embryonic resources for future cell-based therapy.

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8)-deficient mice (Mmp8-/-) exhibit delayed dermal wound healing, but also partly contradicting results have been reported. Using the Mmp8-/- mice we investigated the role of MMP-8 in acute wound healing of the mobile tongue, and analyzed the function of tongue fibroblasts in vitro. Interestingly, in the early phase the tongue wounds of Mmp8-/- mice healed faster than those of wild type (wt) mice resulting in significant difference in wound widths (P=0.001, 6–24h). The Mmp8-/- wounds showed no change in myeloperoxidase positive myeloid cell count, but the level of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 was significantly increased (P=0.007) compared to the wt tongues. Fibroblasts cultured from wt tongues expressed MMP-8 and TGF-β1. However, higher TGF-β1 levels were detected in Mmp8-/- fibroblasts, and MMP-8 treatment decreased phosphorylated Smad-2 levels and α-smooth muscle actin expression in these fibroblasts suggesting reduced TGF-β1 signaling. Consistently, a degradation of recombinant TGF-β1 by MMP-8 decreased its ability to activate the signaling cascade in fibroblasts. Moreover, collagen gels with Mmp8-/- fibroblasts reduced more in size. We conclude that MMP-8 regulates tongue wound contraction rate and TGF-β1 levels. In vitro analyses suggest that MMP-8 may also play a role in regulating TGF-β1 signaling of stromal fibroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Immune evasion genes help human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) establish lifelong persistence. Without immune pressure, laboratory-adapted HCMV strains have undergone genetic alterations. Among these, the deletion of the UL/b’ domain is associated with loss of virulence. In a screen of UL/b’, we identified pUL135 as a protein responsible for the characteristic cytopathic effect of clinical HCMV strains that also protected from natural killer (NK) and T cell attack. pUL135 interacted directly with abl interactor 1 (ABI1) and ABI2 to recruit the WAVE2 regulatory complex to the plasma membrane, remodel the actin cytoskeleton and dramatically reduce the efficiency of immune synapse (IS) formation. An intimate association between F-actin filaments in target cells and the IS was dispelled by pUL135 expression. Thus, F-actin in target cells plays a critical role in synaptogenesis, and this can be exploited by pathogens to protect against cytotoxic immune effector cells. An independent interaction between pUL135 and talin disrupted cell contacts with the extracellular matrix.

Abstract: Summary
Many cell therapies currently being tested are based on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). However, MSCs start to enter the senescent state upon long-term expansion. The role of retinoblastoma (RB) protein in regulating MSC properties is not well studied. Here, we show that RB levels are higher in early-passage MSCs compared with late-passage MSCs. RB knockdown induces premature senescence and reduced differentiation potentials in early-passage MSCs. RB overexpression inhibits senescence and increases differentiation potentials in late-passage MSCs. Expression of DNMT1, but not DNMT3A or DNMT3B, is also higher in early-passage MSCs than in late-passage MSCs. Furthermore, DNMT1 knockdown in early-passage MSCs induces senescence and reduces differentiation potentials, whereas DNMT1 overexpression in late-passage MSCs has the opposite effect. These results demonstrate that RB expressed in early-passage MSCs upregulates DNMT1 expression and inhibits senescence in MSCs. Therefore, genetic modification of RB could be a way to improve the efficiency of MSCs in clinical use.

Abstract: Summary
Enteric viruses, including poliovirus and reovirus, encounter a vast microbial community in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, which has been shown to promote virus replication and pathogenesis. Investigating the underlying mechanisms, we find that poliovirus binds bacterial surface polysaccharides, which enhances virion stability and cell attachment by increasing binding to the viral receptor. Additionally, we identified a poliovirus mutant, VP1-T99K, with reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding. Although T99K and WT poliovirus cell attachment, replication, and pathogenesis in mice are equivalent, VP1-T99K poliovirus was unstable in feces following peroral inoculation of mice. Consequently, the ratio of mutant virus in feces is reduced following additional cycles of infection in mice. Thus, the mutant virus incurs a fitness cost when environmental stability is a factor. These data suggest that poliovirus binds bacterial surface polysaccharides, enhancing cell attachment and environmental stability, potentially promoting transmission to a new host.

Abstract: Understanding the molecular basis of cardiomyocyte development is critical for understanding the pathogenesis of pre- and post-natal cardiac disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression that play an important role in many developmental processes. Here, we show that the miR-99a/let-7c cluster, mapping on human chromosome 21, is involved in the control of cardiomyogenesis by altering epigenetic factors. By perturbing miRNA expression in mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that let-7c promotes cardiomyogenesis by upregulating genes involved in mesoderm specification (T/Bra and Nodal) and cardiac differentiation (Mesp1, Nkx2.5 and Tbx5). The action of let-7c is restricted to the early phase of mesoderm formation at the expense of endoderm and its late activation redirects cells toward other mesodermal derivatives. The Polycomb complex group protein Ezh2 is a direct target of let-7c, which promotes cardiac differentiation by modifying the H3K27me3 marks from the promoters of crucial cardiac transcription factors (Nkx2.5, Mef2c, Tbx5). In contrast, miR-99a represses cardiac differentiation via the nucleosome-remodeling factor Smarca5, attenuating the Nodal/Smad2 signaling. We demonstrated that the identified targets are underexpressed in human Down syndrome fetal heart specimens. By perturbing the expression levels of these miRNAs in embryonic stem cells, we were able to demonstrate that these miRNAs control lineage- and stage-specific transcription factors, working in concert with chromatin modifiers to direct cardiomyogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic and metagenomic sequencing efforts, including human microbiome projects, reveal that microbes often encode multiple systems that appear to accomplish the same task. Whether these predictions reflect actual functional redundancies is unclear. We report that the prominent human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron employs three functional, homologous vitamin B12 transporters that in at least two cases confer a competitive advantage in the presence of distinct B12 analogs (corrinoids). In the mammalian gut, microbial fitness can be determined by the presence or absence of a single transporter. The total number of distinct corrinoid transporter families in the human gut microbiome likely exceeds those observed in B. thetaiotaomicron by an order of magnitude. These results demonstrate that human gut microbes use elaborate mechanisms to capture and differentiate corrinoids in vivo and that apparent redundancies observed in these genomes can instead reflect hidden specificities that determine whether a microbe will colonize its host.

Abstract: Summary
Induction of HIV-1 broad neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a goal of HIV-1 vaccine development but has remained challenging partially due to unusual traits of bnAbs, including high somatic hypermutation (SHM) frequencies and in-frame insertions and deletions (indels). Here we examined the propensity and functional requirement for indels within HIV-1 bnAbs. High-throughput sequencing of the immunoglobulin (Ig) VHDJH genes in HIV-1 infected and uninfected individuals revealed that the indel frequency was elevated among HIV-1-infected subjects, with no unique properties attributable to bnAb-producing individuals. This increased indel occurrence depended only on the frequency of SHM point mutations. Indel-encoded regions were generally proximal to antigen binding sites. Additionally, reconstruction of a HIV-1 CD4-binding site bnAb clonal lineage revealed that a large compound VHDJH indel was required for bnAb activity. Thus, vaccine development should focus on designing regimens targeted at sustained activation of bnAb lineages to achieve the required SHM and indel events.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from somatic cells by ectopic expression of reprogramming factors, e.g., POU5F1 (OCT4), KLF4, and SOX2, have great potential for regenerative medicine. However, before they can be used in a clinical setting, the mechanism of reprogramming needs to be better understood. Here, by engineering reprogramming factors to a destabilizing protein domain, we achieved inducible generation of mouse and pig iPSCs. Stability of the fusion protein was precisely regulated by the addition of the cell-permeable small molecule trimethoprim (TMP) in a dose-dependent manner. With these tools, we found that during the early and middle stages of reprogramming, exogenous OCT4 or KLF4 could be omitted, whereas exogenous SOX2 expression at early and middle stages was required for successful reprogramming. Our TMP reprogramming system is useful for defining the stoichiometry and temporal requirements of transcription factors for reprogramming.

Abstract: Crosstalk between carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells is suggested to mediate phenotype transition of cancer cells as a prerequisite for tumour progression, to predict patients’ outcome, and to influence the efficacy of EGFR inhibitor therapies. Here we investigate the influence of activated fibroblasts as a model for CAFs on phenotype and EGFR signalling in OSCC cells in vitro. For this, immortalised hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts were activated with TGFβ1 and PDGFAB to generate a myofibroblast or proliferative phenotype, respectively. Conditioned media (FCMTGF, FCMPDGF) were used to stimulate PE/CA-PJ15 OSCC cells. Results were compared to the effect of conditioned media of non-stimulated fibroblasts (FCMB). FCMTGF stimulation leads to an up-regulation of vimentin in the OSCC cells and an enhancement of invasive behaviour, indicating EMT-like effects. Similarly, FCMTGF≫FCMPDGF induced up-regulation of EGFR, but not of ErbB2/ErbB3. In addition, we detected an increase in basal activities of ERK, PI3K/Akt and Stat3 (FCMTGF>FCMPDGF) accompanied by protein interaction of vimentin with pERK. These effects are correlated with an increased proliferation. In summary, our results suggest that the activated myofibroblast phenotype provides soluble factors which are able to induce EMT-like phenomena and to increase EGFR signalling as well as cell proliferation in OSCC cells. Our results indicate a possible influence of activated myofibroblasts on EGFR-inhibitor therapy. Therefore, CAFs may serve as promising novel targets for combined therapy strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can establish latent infection in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) or CD14 (+) monocytes. While circularized viral genomes are observed during latency, how viral genomes persist or which viral factors contribute to genome maintenance and/or replication is unclear. Previously, we identified a HCMV cis-acting viral maintenance element (TR element) and showed that HCMV IE1 exon 4 mRNA is expressed in latently infected HPCs. We now show that a smaller IE1 protein species (IE1x4) is expressed in latently infected HPCs. IE1x4 protein expression is required for viral genome persistence and maintenance and replication of a TR element containing plasmid (pTR). Both IE1x4 and the cellular transcription factor Sp1 interact with the TR, and inhibition of Sp1 binding abrogates pTR amplification. Further, IE1x4 interacts with Topoisomerase IIβ (TOPOIIβ), whose activity is required for pTR amplification. These results identify a HCMV latency-specific factor that promotes viral chromosome maintenance and replication.

Abstract: Hsp70, Hsp32, and Hsp27 were induced by celastrol in rat cerebral cortical cultures at dosages that did not affect cell viability. Pronounced differences were observed in the cellular localization of these heat shock proteins in cell types of cerebral cortical cultures. Celastrol-induced Hsp70 localized to the cell body and cellular processes of neurons that were identified by neuron-specific βIII-tubulin. Hsp70 was not detected in adjacent GFAP-positive glial cells that demonstrated a strong signal for Hsp27 and Hsp32 in both glial cell bodies and cellular processes. Cells in the cerebral cortex region of the brain are selectively impacted during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease which is a “protein misfolding disorder.” Heat shock proteins provide a line of defense against misfolded, aggregation-prone proteins. Celastrol is a potential agent to counter this neurodegenerative disorder as recent evidence indicates that in vivo administration of celastrol in a transgenic model of Alzheimer’s reduces an important neuropathological hallmark of this disease, namely, amyloid beta pathology that involves protein aggregation.

Abstract: Estrogenic actions are closely related to cardiovascular disease. Ritonavir (RTV), a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor, induces atherosclerosis in an estrogen-related manner. However, how RTV induce pathological phenotypes through estrogen pathway remains unclear. In this study, we found that RTV increases thickness of coronary artery walls of Sprague Dawley rats and plasma free fatty acids (FFA) levels. In addition, RTV could induce foam cell formation, downregulate both estrogen receptor α (ERα) and ERβ expression, upregulate G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) expression, and all of them could be partially blocked by 17β-estradiol (E2), suggesting RTV acts as an antagonist for E2. Computational modeling shows a similar interaction with ERα between RTV and 2-aryl indoles, which are highly subtype-selective ligands for ERα. We also found that RTV directly bound to ERα and selectively inhibited the nuclear localization of ERα, and residue Leu536 in the hydrophobic core of ligand binding domain (LBD) was essential for the interaction with RTV. In addition, RTV did not change the secondary structure of ERα-LBD like E2, which explained how ERα lost the capacity of nuclear translocation under the treatment of RTV. All of the evidences suggest that ritonavir acts as an antagonist for 17β-estradiol in regulating α subtype estrogen receptor function and early events of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small single-stranded non-coding RNAs that have an important regulatory function in animal growth and developmental processes. However, the differential expression of miRNA and the role of these miRNAs in heat-stressed Holstein cows are still unknown. In this study, the profile of differentially expressed miRNAs and the target genes analysis in the serum of heat-stressed and normal Holstein cows were investigated by a Solexa deep-sequencing approach and bioinformatics. The data identified 52 differentially expressed miRNAs in 486 known miRNAs which were changed significantly between heat-stressed and normal Holstein cows (fold change >2, P < 0.001). Target genes analysis showed that at least 7 miRNAs (miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-146a, miR-30a-5p, miR-345-3p, miR-199a-3p, and miR-1246) were involved in the response to stress, oxidative stress, development of the immune system, and immune response among the identified 52 differentially expressed miRNAs. Five miRNAs (miR-27b, miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-26a, and miR-146b) were involved in stress and immune responses and the expression of five miRNAs was striking (P < 0.001). In addition, RT-qPCR and deep-sequencing methods showed that 8 miRNAs among the 12 selected miRNAs (miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-27b, miR-30a-5p, miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-345-3p, and miR-1246) were highly expressed in the serum of heat-stressed Holstein cows. GO and KEGG pathway analysis showed that these differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in a pathway that may differentially regulate the expression of stress response and immune response genes. Our study provides an overview of miRNAs expression profile and the interaction between miRNAs and their target genes, which will lead to further understanding of the important roles of miRNAs in heat-stressed Holstein cows.

Abstract: Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific adipocytokine that possesses anti-atherogenic and anti-diabetic properties. It has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system, but it remains to be elucidated whether adiponectin has a therapeutic effect on vascular damage induced by the potential vasoactive substance angiotensin II (Ang II). In this study, the effects of adiponectin on Ang II-induced vascular endothelial damage were investigated. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelium cells, Ang II stimulation increased generation of ROS and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, both of which were clearly restored by administration of adiponectin. In addition, administration of adiponectin was found to increase cell viability and prevent apoptosis. Our results also demonstrate that the protective effects of adiponectin against Ang II-induced vascular endothelial damage are dependent on the binding of adiponectin to its cell surface receptor 1. Importantly, we found that adiponectin treatment modulates the apoptotic pathway by reducing the expression of LOX-1, up-regulating both cIAP-1 and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. Finally, our data displayed that the protective effects of adiponectin against Ang II cytotoxicity depend on AMPK activation mediated by the endosomal adaptor protein, adaptor protein with phosphotyrosine binding, pleckstrin homology domains, and leucine zipper motif.

Abstract: Clinical experience for peripheral arterial disease treatment shows poor results when synthetic grafts are used to approach infrapopliteal arterial segments. However, tissue engineering may be an option to yield surrogate biocompatible neovessels. Thus, biological decellularized scaffolds could provide natural tissue architecture to use in tissue engineering, when the absence of ideal autologous veins reduces surgical options. The goal of this study was to evaluate different chemical induced decellularization protocols of the inferior vena cava of rabbits. They were decellularized with Triton X100 (TX100), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or sodium deoxycholate (DS). Afterwards, we assessed the remaining extracellular matrix (ECM) integrity, residual toxicity and the biomechanical resistance of the scaffolds. Our results showed that TX100 was not effective to remove the cells, while protocols using SDS 1% for 2h and DS 2% for 1h, efficiently removed the cells and were better characterized. These scaffolds preserved the original organization of ECM. In addition, the residual toxicity assessment did not reveal statistically significant changes while decellularized scaffolds retained the equivalent biomechanical properties when compared with the control. Our results concluded that protocols using SDS and DS were effective at obtaining decellularized scaffolds, which may be useful for blood vessel tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
The increased incidence of obesity and metabolic disease underscores the importance of elucidating the biology of adipose tissue development. The recent discovery of cell surface markers for prospective identification of adipose precursor cells (APCs) in vivo will greatly facilitate these studies, yet tools for specifically targeting these cells in vivo have not been identified. Here, we survey three transgenic mouse lines, Fabp4-Cre, PdgfRα-Cre, and Prx1-Cre, precisely assessing Cre-mediated recombination in adipose stromal populations and mature tissues. Our data provide key insights into the utility of these tools to modulate gene expression in adipose tissues. In particular, Fabp4-Cre is not effective to target APCs, nor is its activity restricted to these cells. PdgfRα-Cre directs recombination in the vast majority of APCs, but also targets other populations. In contrast, adipose expression of Prx1-Cre is chiefly limited to subcutaneous inguinal APCs, which will be valuable for dissection of APC functions among adipose depots.

Abstract: Preclinical research in animals often fails to adequately predict the outcomes observed in human patients. Chimeric animals bearing individual human tissues have been developed to provide improved models of human-specific cellular processes. Mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem cells can be used to study human immune responses, infections of blood cells and processes of hematopoiesis. Animals with humanized livers are useful for modeling hepatotropic infections as well as drug metabolism and hepatotoxicity. However, many pathophysiologic processes involve both the liver and the hematolymphoid system. Examples include hepatitis C/HIV co-infection, immune mediated liver diseases, liver injuries with inflammation such as steatohepatitis and alcoholic liver disease. We developed a robust protocol enabling the concurrent double-humanization of mice with mature hepatocytes and human blood. Immune-deficient, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah−/−), Rag2−/− and Il2rg−/− deficient animals on the NOD-strain background (FRGN) were simultaneously co-transplanted with adult human hepatocytes and hematopoietic stem cells after busulfan and Ad:uPA pre-conditioning. Four months after transplantation the average human liver repopulation exceeded 80% and hematopoietic chimerism also was high (40–80% in bone marrow). Importantly, human macrophages (Kupffer cells) were present in the chimeric livers. Double-chimeric FRGN mice will serve as a new model for disease processes that involve interactions between hepatocytes and hematolymphoid cells.

Abstract: Formation of cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates is a hallmark of Huntington’s disease (HD). Inhibition of aggregation of mutant huntingtin has been suggested to be a feasible approach to slow down the progress of this neurodegenerative disorder. Exposure to environmental stimuli leads to the activation of the stress response machinery of the cell. In this work, we have investigated the effect of salt shock on the aggregation of mutant huntingtin (103Q-htt) in a yeast model of HD. We found that at an optimum concentration of NaCl, the protein no longer formed aggregates and existed in the soluble form. This led to lower oxidative stress in the cell. Salt shock resulted in the synthesis of the osmolyte glycerol, which was partially responsible for the beneficial effect of stress. Surprisingly, we also found increase in the synthesis of another osmolyte, trehalose. Using deletion strains, we were able to show that the effect on solubilisation of mutant huntingtin is due to the synthesis of optimum amounts of both osmolytes. Stress-induced effect was monitored on gene expression. Genes related to proteins of the osmosensory pathway were upregulated on exposure to salt while those coding for stress response proteins were downregulated when solubilisation of mutant huntingtin occurred. Our study shows that activation of stress response elements can have beneficial effect in the solubilisation of huntingtin in a yeast model of HD.

Abstract: Although the peripheral nervous system is capable of regeneration, this capability is limited. As a potential means of augmenting nerve regeneration, the effects of cerebrolysin (CL) – a proteolytic peptide fraction – were tested in vitro on the motor-neuron-like NSC-34 cell line and organotypic spinal cord cultures. Therefore, NSC-34 cells were subjected to mechanical stress by changing media and metabolic stress by oxygen glucose deprivation. Afterwards, cell survival/proliferation using MTT and BrdU-labeling (FACS) and neurite sprouting using ImageJ analysis were evaluated. Calpain-1, Src and α-spectrin protein expression were analyzed by Western blot. In organotypic cultures, the effect of CL on motor neuron survival and neurite sprouting was tested by immunohistochemistry. CL had a temporary anti-proliferative but initially neuroprotective effect on OGD-stressed NSC-34 cells. High-dosed or repeatedly applied CL was deleterious for cell survival. CL amplified neurite reconstruction to limited extent, affected calpain-1 protein expression and influenced calpain-mediated spectrin cleavage as a function of Src expression. In organotypic spinal cord slice cultures, CL was not able to support motor neuron survival/neurite sprouting. Moreover, it hampered astroglia and microglia activities. The data suggest that CL may have only isolated positive effects on injured spinal motor neurons. High-dosed or accumulated CL seemed to have adverse effects in treatment of spinal cord injury. Further experiments are required to optimize the conditions for a safe clinical administration of CL in spinal cord injuries.

Abstract: Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including gefitinib, have been evaluated in patients with malignant gliomas. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in gefitinib-mediated anticancer effects against glioma are incompletely understood. In the present study, the cytostatic potential of gefitinib was demonstrated by the inhibition of glioma cell growth, long-term clonogenic survival, and xenograft tumor growth. The cytostatic consequences were accompanied by autophagy, as evidenced by monodansylcadaverine staining of acidic vesicle formation, conversion of microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II), degradation of p62, punctate pattern of GFP-LC3, and conversion of GFP-LC3 to cleaved-GFP. Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenosine and chloroquine and genetic silencing of LC3 or Beclin 1 attenuated gefitinib-induced growth inhibition. Gefitinib-induced autophagy was not accompanied by the disruption of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Instead, the activation of liver kinase-B1/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling correlated well with the induction of autophagy and growth inhibition caused by gefitinib. Silencing of AMPK suppressed gefitinib-induced autophagy and growth inhibition. The crucial role of AMPK activation in inducing glioma autophagy and growth inhibition was further supported by the actions of AMP mimetic AICAR. Gefitinib was shown to be capable of reducing the proliferation of glioma cells, presumably by autophagic mechanisms involving AMPK activation.

Abstract: Satellite cells (SCs) are the resident stem cells of skeletal muscle tissue which play a major role in muscle adaptation, e.g. as a response to physical training. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an intermittent lactate (La) treatment on the proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, simulating a microcycle of high intensity endurance training. Furthermore, the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this context was examined. C2C12 myoblasts were therefore repeatedly incubated for 2h each day with 10mM or 20mM La differentiation medium (DM) and in some cases 20mM La DM plus different antioxidative substances for up to 5days. La free (0mM) DM served as a control. Immunocytochemical staining, Western blot analysis and colorimetric assays were used to assess oxidative stress, proliferation, and differentiation. Results show that La induces oxidative stress, enhances cell-cycle withdrawal, and initiates early differentiation but delays late differentiation in a timely and dose-dependent manner. These effects can be reversed by the addition of antioxidants to the La DM. We therefore conclude that La has a regulatory role in C2C12 myogenesis via a ROS-sensitive mechanism which elicits implications for reassessing some aspects of training and the use of nutritional supplements.

Abstract: Although adult cardiomyocytes have the capacity for cellular regeneration, they are unable to fully repair severely injured hearts. The use of embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived cardiomyocytes as transplantable heart muscle cells has been proposed as a solution, but is limited by the lack of understanding of the developmental pathways leading to specification of cardiac progenitors. Identification of these pathways will enhance the ability to differentiate cardiomyocytes into a clinical source of transplantable cells. Here, we show that the mRNA 3′ end processing protein, CstF-64, is essential for cardiomyocyte differentiation in mouse ESCs. Loss of CstF-64 in mouse ESCs results in loss of differentiation potential toward the endodermal lineage. However, CstF-64 knockout (Cstf2E6) cells were able to differentiate into neuronal progenitors, demonstrating that some differentiation pathways were still intact. Markers for mesodermal differentiation were also present, although Cstf2E6 cells were defective in forming beating cardiomyocytes and expressing cardiac specific markers. Since the extraembryonic endoderm is needed for cardiomyocyte differentiation and endodermal markers were decreased, we hypothesized that endodermal factors were required for efficient cardiomyocyte formation in the Cstf2E6 cells. Using conditioned medium from the extraembryonic endodermal (XEN) stem cell line we were able to restore cardiomyocyte differentiation in Cstf2E6 cells, suggesting that CstF-64 has a role in regulating endoderm differentiation that is necessary for cardiac specification and that extraembryonic endoderm signaling is essential for cardiomyocyte development.

Abstract: The Disposable Soma Theory holds that genetic integrity will be maintained at more pristine levels in germ cells than in somatic cells because of the unique role germ cells play in perpetuating the species. We tested the hypothesis that the same concept applies to pluripotent cells compared to differentiated cells. Analyses of transcriptome and cistrome databases, along with canonical pathway analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed differential expression of DNA repair and cell death genes in embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells relative to fibroblasts, and predicted extensive direct and indirect interactions between the pluripotency and genetic integrity gene networks in pluripotent cells. These data suggest that enhanced maintenance of genetic integrity is fundamentally linked to the epigenetic state of pluripotency at the genomic level. In addition, these findings demonstrate how a small number of key pluripotency factors can regulate large numbers of downstream genes in a pathway-specific manner.

Prolactin receptor attenuation induces zinc pool redistribution through ZnT2 and decreases invasion in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells,

Abstract: Prolactin receptor (PRL-R) activation regulates cell differentiation, proliferation, cell survival and motility of breast cells. Prolactin (PRL) and PRL-R over-expression are strongly implicated in breast cancer, particularly contributing to tumor growth and invasion in the more aggressive estrogen-receptor negative (ER−) disease. PRL-R antagonists have been suggested as potential therapeutic agents; however, mechanisms through which PRL-R antagonists exert their actions are not well-understood. Zinc (Zn) is a regulatory factor for over 10% of the proteome, regulating critical cell processes such as proliferation, cell signaling, transcription, apoptosis and autophagy. PRL-R signaling regulates Zn metabolism in breast cells. Herein we determined effects of PRL-R attenuation on cellular Zn metabolism and cell function in a model of ER-, PRL-R over-expressing breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-453). PRL-R attenuation post-transcriptionally increased ZnT2 abundance and redistributed intracellular Zn pools into lysosomes and mitochondria. ZnT2-mediated lysosomal Zn sequestration was associated with reduced matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) activity and decreased invasion. ZnT2-mediated Zn accumulation in mitochondria was associated with increased mitochondrial oxidation. Our results suggest that PRL-R antagonism in PRL-R over-expressing breast cancer cells may reduce invasion through the redistribution of intracellular Zn pools critical for cellular function.

Abstract: Recent reports suggest that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade by MK-801 decreases tumor growth. Thus, we investigated whether other ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) antagonists were also able to modulate the proliferation of melanoma cells. On the other hand, the antiestrogen tamoxifen (TAM) decreases the proliferation of melanoma cells, and is included in combined therapies for melanoma. As the efficacy of TAM is limited by its metabolism, we investigated the effects of the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 in combination with TAM and its active metabolites, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHTAM) and endoxifen (EDX). The NMDAR blockers MK-801 and memantine decreased mouse melanoma K1735-M2 cell proliferation. In contrast, the NMDAR competitive antagonist APV and the AMPA and kainate receptor antagonist NBQX did not affect cell proliferation, suggesting that among the iGluR antagonists only the NMDAR channel blockers inhibit melanoma cell proliferation. The combination of antiestrogens with MK-801 potentiated their individual effects on cell biomass due to diminished cell proliferation, since it decreased the cell number and DNA synthesis without increasing cell death. Importantly, TAM metabolites combined with MK-801 promoted cell cycle arrest in G1. Therefore, the data obtained suggest that the activity of MK-801 and antiestrogens in K1735-M2 cells is greatly enhanced when used in combination.

Abstract: Gene therapy mediated by bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells (BM-HSC) has been widely used in treating genetic deficiencies in both pre-clinical and clinical settings. Using mitotically inactive cell-targeting lentivirus with separate promoters for our gene of interest (the murine MHC class II (MHCII) chaperone, invariant chain (Ii)) and a GFP reporter, we monitored the expression and function of introduced Ii in various types of professional antigen presenting cells (B cells, macrophages and DC) from different organs (spleen, pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN), BM and blood). Ii and GFP were detected. Ii levels correlated with GFP levels only in macrophages and monocytes from spleen, monocytes from PLN and macrophage precursors from blood. By cell type, Ii levels in PLN cells were more similar to those in spleen cells than to those in blood or BM cells. Functionally, Ii expressed in PLN or spleen had more effect on MHCII abundance than Ii expressed in BM or blood. The results have implications for analysis of the outcomes of gene therapy when both therapeutic and reporter genes are introduced. The findings also have implications for understanding the development of immune molecule function.

Abstract: This study investigates how epithelial cells moving together function to coordinate their collective movement to repair a wound. Using a lens ex vivo mock cataract surgery model we show that region-specific reorganization of cell–cell junctions, cytoskeletal networks and myosin function along apical and basal domains of an epithelium mediates the process of collective migration. An apical junctional complex composed of N-cadherin/ZO-1/myosin II linked to a cortical actin cytoskeleton network maintains integrity of the tissue during the healing process. These cells’ basal domains often preceded their apical domains in the direction of movement, where an atypical N-cadherin/ZO-1 junction, linked to an actin stress fiber network rich in phosphomyosin, was prominent in cryptic lamellipodia. These junctions joined the protruding forward-moving lamellipodia to the back end of the cell moving directly in front of it. These were the only junctions detected in cryptic lamellipodia of lens epithelia migrating in response to wounding that could transmit the protrusive forces that drive collective movement. Both integrity of the epithelium and ability to effectively heal the wound was found to depend on myosin mechanical cues.

Abstract: Summary
To harness the potential of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), an abundant supply of their progenies is required. Here, hPSC expansion as matrix-independent aggregates in suspension culture was combined with cardiomyogenic differentiation using chemical Wnt pathway modulators. A multiwell screen was scaled up to stirred Erlenmeyer flasks and subsequently to tank bioreactors, applying controlled feeding strategies (batch and cyclic perfusion). Cardiomyogenesis was sensitive to the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 concentration, whereas the aggregate size was no prevailing factor across culture platforms. However, in bioreactors, the pattern of aggregate formation in the expansion phase dominated subsequent differentiation. Global profiling revealed a culture-dependent expression of BMP agonists/antagonists, suggesting their decisive role in cell-fate determination. Furthermore, metallothionein was discovered as a potentially stress-related marker in hPSCs. In 100 ml bioreactors, the production of 40 million predominantly ventricular-like cardiomyocytes (up to 85% purity) was enabled that were directly applicable to bioartificial cardiac tissue formation.

Abstract: In this study, we discovered a subpopulation of 3T3 feeder cells were malignantly transformed by nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tumor cells during co-culture. The transformed 3T3 cells acquired an accelerated growth rate, displayed loosely attached multilayer growth in vitro and highly tumorigenic in vivo. Most strikingly, instead of forming sarcomas, they developed into carcinoma-like tumors somewhat resembling the original NPC. We further demonstrated the transformation is not a single isolated event, rather a common reproducible, cell contact dispensable phenomena among NPC tumor cells. However, NPC tumor cells alone were not sufficient to confer the transformed characteristics onto normal human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Recent reports of directed reprogramming have raised questions about the stability of cell lineages. Here, we have addressed this issue, focusing upon skin-derived precursors (SKPs), a dermally derived precursor cell. We show by lineage tracing that murine SKPs from dorsal skin originate from mesenchymal and not neural crest-derived cells. These mesenchymally derived SKPs can, without genetic manipulation, generate functional Schwann cells, a neural crest cell type, and are highly similar at the transcriptional level to Schwann cells isolated from the peripheral nerve. This is not a mouse-specific phenomenon, since human SKPs that are highly similar at the transcriptome level can be made from neural crest-derived facial and mesodermally derived foreskin dermis and the foreskin SKPs can make myelinating Schwann cells. Thus, nonneural crest-derived mesenchymal precursors can differentiate into bona fide peripheral glia in the absence of genetic manipulation, suggesting that developmentally defined lineage boundaries are more flexible than widely thought.

Abstract: The hTERT-immortalization of human bone marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hMSCs) was proposed to address availability/standardization issues for experimental or clinical studies, but raised concerns due to possible uncontrolled growth or malignant cell transformation. Here we report a method to generate a hMSCs line with controlled survival, through the implementation of a pre-established suicide system (inducible caspase 9, iCasp9) in hTERT-transduced hMSCs. Primary hMSCs were successfully immortalized (>280 PD) and further transduced with the iCasp9 device. A clone was selected and shown to maintain typical properties of primary hMSCs, including phenotype, differentiation and immunomodulation capacities. The successive transductions did not induce tumorigenic transformation, as assessed by analysis of cell cycle regulators and in vivo luciferase-based cell tracking. Cells could be efficiently induced toward apoptosis (>95%) both in vitro and in vivo. By combining the opposite concepts of ‘induced-life’ and ‘inducible-death’, we generated a hMSCs line with defined properties and allowing for temporally controlled survival. The cell line represents a relevant tool for medical discovery in regenerative medicine and a potential means to address availability, standardization and safety requirements in cell & gene therapy. The concept of a hTERT-iCasp9 combination, here explored in the context of hMSCs, could be extended to other types of progenitor/stem cells.

Abstract: This study highlights the highly dynamic nature of SULF1/SULF2 splice variants in different human pancreatic cancers that regulate the activities of multiple cell signalling pathways in development and disease. Most pancreatic tumours expressed variable levels of both SULF1 and SULF2 variants including some expression during inflammation and pancreatitis. Many ductal and centro-acinar cell-derived pancreatic tumours are known to evolve into lethal pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas but the present study also detected different stages of such tumour progression in the same tissue biopsies of not only acinar cell origin but also islet cell-derived cancers. The examination of caerulein-induced pancreatic injury and tumorigenesis in a Kras-driven mouse model confirmed the activation and gradual increase of SULF1/SULF2 variants during pancreatitis and tumorigenesis but with reduced levels in Stat3 conditional knockout mice with reduced inflammation. The significance of differential spatial and temporal patterns of specific SULF1/SULF2 splice variant expression during cancer growth became further apparent from their differential stimulatory or inhibitory effects on growth factor activities, tumour growth and angiogenesis not only during in vitro but also in vivo growth thus providing possible novel therapeutic targets.

Abstract: The acute response of the rodent subventricular zone (SVZ) to traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves a physical expansion through increased cell proliferation. However, the cellular underpinnings of these changes are not well understood. Our analyses have revealed that there are two distinct transit-amplifying cell populations that respond in opposite ways to injury. Mash1+ transit-amplifying cells are the primary SVZ cell type that is stimulated to divide following TBI. In contrast, the EGFR+ population, which has been considered to be a functionally equivalent progenitor population to Mash1+ cells in the uninjured brain, becomes significantly less proliferative after injury. Although normally quiescent GFAP+ stem cells are stimulated to divide in SVZ ablation models, we found that the GFAP+ stem cells do not divide more after TBI. We found, instead, that TBI results in increased numbers of GFAP+/EGFR+ stem cells via non-proliferative means—potentially through the dedifferentiation of progenitor cells. EGFR+ progenitors from injured brains only were competent to revert to a stem cell state following brief exposure to growth factors. Thus, our results demonstrate previously unknown changes in lineage relationships that differ from conventional models and likely reflect an adaptive response of the SVZ to maintain endogenous brain repair after TBI.

Abstract: Summary
Germ cells are thought to exhibit a unique DNA damage response that differs from that of somatic stem cells, and previous studies suggested that Trp53 is not involved in the survival of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) after irradiation. Here, we report a critical role for the Trp53-Trp53inp1-Tnfrsf10b pathway during radiation-induced SSC apoptosis. Spermatogonial transplantation revealed that Trp53 deficiency increased the survival of SSCs after irradiation. Although Bbc3, a member of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, was implicated in apoptosis of germ and somatic stem cells, Bbc3 depletion inhibited apoptosis in committed spermatogonia, but not in SSCs. In contrast, inhibition of Tnfrsf10b, an extrinsic apoptosis regulator, rescued SSCs. Tnfrsf10b, whose deficiency protected SSCs, was upregulated by Trp53inp1 upon irradiation. These results suggest that the Trp53-Trp53inp1-Tnfrsf10b pathway responds to genotoxic damage in SSCs and that stem and progenitor cells exhibit distinct DNA damage responses in self-renewing tissue.

Abstract: Common methods for the generation of human embryonic-derived neural stem cells (hNSCs) result in cells with potentially compromised safety profiles due to maintenance of cells in conditions containing non-human proteins (e.g. in bovine serum or on mouse fibroblast feeders). Additionally, sufficient expansion of resulting hNSCs for scaling out or up in a clinically relevant time frame has proven to be difficult. Here, we report a strategy that produces hNSCs in completely “Xeno-Free” culture conditions. Furthermore, we have enriched the hNSCs for the cell surface marker CD133 via magnetic sorting, which has led to an increase in the expansion rate and neuronal fate specification of the hNSCs in vitro. Critically, we have also confirmed neural lineage specificity upon sorted hNSC transplantation into the immunodeficient NOD-scid mouse brain. The future use or adaptation of these protocols has the potential to better facilitate the advancement of pre-clinical strategies from the bench to the bedside.

Abstract: The shell colour of many pulmonate land snail species is highly diverse. Besides a genetic basis, environmentally triggered epigenetic mechanisms including stress proteins as evolutionary capacitors are thought to influence such phenotypic diversity. In this study, we investigated the relationship of stress protein (Hsp70) levels with temperature stress tolerance, population structure and phenotypic diversity within and among different populations of a xerophilic Mediterranean snail species (Xeropicta derbentina). Hsp70 levels varied considerably among populations, and were significantly associated with shell colour diversity: individuals in populations exhibiting low diversity expressed higher Hsp70 levels both constitutively and under heat stress than those of phenotypically diverse populations. In contrast, population structure (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene) did not correlate with phenotypic diversity. However, genetic parameters (both within and among population differences) were able to explain variation in Hsp70 induction at elevated but non-pathologic temperatures. Our observation that (1) population structure had a high explanatory potential for Hsp70 induction and that (2) Hsp70 levels, in turn, correlated with phenotypic diversity while (3) population structure and phenotypic diversity failed to correlate provides empirical evidence for Hsp70 to act as a mediator between genotypic variation and phenotype and thus for chaperone-driven evolutionary capacitance in natural populations.

Abstract: Summary
Adult forebrain definitive neural stem cells (NSCs) comprise a subpopulation of GFAP-expressing subependymal cells that arise from embryonic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-dependent NSCs that are first isolated from the developing brain at E8.5. Embryonic FGF-dependent NSCs are derived from leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-responsive, Oct4-expressing primitive NSCs (pNSCs) that are first isolated at E5.5. We report the presence of a rare population of pNCSs in the periventricular region of the adult forebrain. Adult-derived pNSCs (AdpNSCs) are GFAP−, LIF-responsive stem cells that display pNSC properties, including Oct4 expression and the ability to integrate into the inner cell mass of blastocysts. AdpNSCs generate self-renewing, multipotent colonies that give rise to definitive GFAP+ NSCs in vitro and repopulate the subependyma after the ablation of GFAP+ NSCs in vivo. These data support the hypothesis that a rare population of pNSCs is present in the adult brain and is upstream of the GFAP+ NSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The scarcity of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in the developing mammalian embryo hampers robust biochemical analysis of the processes that underlie early germ cell formation. Here, we demonstrate that DAZL, a germ cell-specific RNA binding protein, is a robust PGC marker during in vitro germ cell development. Using Dazl-GFP reporter ESCs, we demonstrate that DAZL plays a central role in a large mRNA/protein interactive network that blocks the translation of core pluripotency factors, including Sox2 and Sall4, as well as of Suz12, a polycomb family member required for differentiation of pluripotent cells. Thus, DAZL limits both pluripotency and somatic differentiation in nascent PGCs. In addition, we observed that DAZL associates with mRNAs of key Caspases and similarly inhibits their translation. This elegant fail-safe mechanism ensures that, whereas loss of DAZL results in prolonged expression of pluripotency factors, teratoma formation is avoided due to the concomitant activation of the apoptotic cascade.

Abstract: Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a potent bioactive phospholipid, has been reported to regulate a broad spectrum of biological processes. However, little is known regarding S1P’s effects on mitochondrial function. In this study, we investigated the S1P’s effects on the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) signaling pathway and mitochondrial biogenesis in Hep G2 cells. Our results indicate that administration of S1P leads to a significant upregulation of mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription, increased mitochondrial mass, and elevated adenosine triphosphate synthesis. In addition, we found that treatment with S1P stimulates expression of PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as its downstream targets: nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Moreover, our data demonstrate that S1P’s effects on PGC-1α and mitochondrial biogenesis are mediated by the protein kinase A/cAMP response element-binding protein (PKA/CREB) pathway. Importantly, we also revealed that S1P’s effects on mitochondrial biogenesis are dependent on its type 2 receptor (S1P2), though not on either its type 1 (S1P1) or type 3 (S1P3) receptors. Based on these observations, we concluded that S1P activates the PKA/CREB pathway through S1P2, which then promotes expression of PGC-1α/NRF1/TFAM and subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis in Hep G2 cells.

Abstract: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population and show significant expansion under pathological conditions. microRNA plays important roles in many biological processes, whether microRNAs have a function in the expansion of MDSCs is still not very clear. In this study, miR-34a overexpression can induce the expansion of MDSCs in bone marrow chimera and transgenic mice model. The experimental results suggest that miR-34a inhibited the apoptosis of MDSCs but did not affect the proliferation of MDSCs. The distinct mRNA microarray profiles of MDSCs of wild type and miR-34a over-expressing MDSCs combined with the target prediction of miR-34a suggest that miR-34a may target genes such as p2rx7, Tia1, and plekhf1 to inhibit the apoptosis of MDSCs. Taken together, miR-34a contributes to the expansion of MDSCs by inhibiting the apoptosis of MDSCs.

Abstract: Fuel cell manufacturers worldwide have been examining waste-to-energy applications (WtE, also referred to as EfW, energy from waste, and more specifically hydrogen from waste) since the early 1990s. During that time, proton-exchange membrane (PEMFC), alkaline (AFC), molten carbonate and direct carbonate (MCFC/DFC), solid oxide (SOFC), and phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC) have been demonstrated. Recent, promising WtE economics are resulting from biogas-fueled fuel cells that can generate multiple revenue streams at MW scale. In this first of a two-part article, we look at the practicalities of bioH2 for fuel cells, and look at how FuelCell Energy is showing this can certainly be done.

Abstract: Osteogenic differentiation of various adult stem cell populations such as neural crest-derived stem cells is of great interest in the context of bone regeneration. Ideally, exogenous differentiation should mimic an endogenous differentiation process, which is partly mediated by topological cues. To elucidate the osteoinductive potential of porous substrates with different pore diameters (30nm, 100nm), human neural crest-derived stem cells isolated from the inferior nasal turbinate were cultivated on the surface of nanoporous titanium covered membranes without additional chemical or biological osteoinductive cues. As controls, flat titanium without any topological features and osteogenic medium was used. Cultivation of human neural crest-derived stem cells on 30nm pores resulted in osteogenic differentiation as demonstrated by alkaline phosphatase activity after seven days as well as by calcium deposition after 3weeks of cultivation. In contrast, cultivation on flat titanium and on membranes equipped with 100nm pores was not sufficient to induce osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, we demonstrate an increase of osteogenic transcripts including Osterix, Osteocalcin and up-regulation of Integrin β1 and α2 in the 30nm pore approach only. Thus, transplantation of stem cells pre-cultivated on nanostructured implants might improve the clinical outcome by support of the graft adherence and acceleration of the regeneration process.

Abstract: The role Hsp60 might play in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is under investigation, but little information exists pertaining to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT). With the aim to fill this gap, in the present work, we directed our attention to Hsp60 participation in HT pathogenesis. We found Hsp60 levels increased in the blood of HT patients compared to controls. The chaperonin was immunolocalized in thyroid tissue specimens from patients with HT, both in thyrocytes and oncocytes (Hurthle cells) with higher levels compared to controls (goiter). In oncocytes, we found Hsp60 not only in the cytoplasm but also on the plasma membrane, as shown by double immunofluorescence performed on fine needle aspiration cytology. By bioinformatics, we found regions in the Hsp60 molecule with remarkable structural similarity with the thyroglobulin (TG) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) molecules, which supports the notion that autoantibodies against TG and TPO are likely to recognize Hsp60 on the plasma membrane of oncocytes. This was also supported by data obtained by ELISA, showing that anti-TG and anti-TPO antibodies cross-react with human recombinant Hsp60. Antibody-antigen (Hsp60) reaction on the cell surface could very well mediate thyroid cell damage and destruction, perpetuating inflammation. Experiments with recombinant Hsp60 did not show stimulation of cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HT patients. All together, these results led us to hypothesize that Hsp60 may be an active player in HT pathogenesis via an antibody-mediated immune mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Our intestinal microbiota harbors a diverse microbial community, often containing opportunistic bacteria with virulence potential. However, mutualistic host-microbial interactions prevent disease by opportunistic pathogens through poorly understood mechanisms. We show that the epithelial interleukin-22 receptor IL-22RA1 protects against lethal Citrobacter rodentium infection and chemical-induced colitis by promoting colonization resistance against an intestinal opportunistic bacterium, Enterococcus faecalis. Susceptibility of Il22ra1−/− mice to C. rodentium was associated with preferential expansion and epithelial translocation of pathogenic E. faecalis during severe microbial dysbiosis and was ameloriated with antibiotics active against E. faecalis. RNA sequencing analyses of primary colonic organoids showed that IL-22RA1 signaling promotes intestinal fucosylation via induction of the fucosyltransferase Fut2. Additionally, administration of fucosylated oligosaccharides to C. rodentium-challenged Il22ra1−/− mice attenuated infection and promoted E. faecalis colonization resistance by restoring the diversity of anaerobic commensal symbionts. These results support a model whereby IL-22RA1 enhances host-microbiota mutualism to limit detrimental overcolonization by opportunistic pathogens.

Abstract: Malignant astrocytomas are highly invasive into adjacent and distant regions of the normal brain. Rho GTPases are small monomeric G proteins that play important roles in cytoskeleton rearrangement, cell motility, and tumor invasion. In the present study, we show that the knock down of StarD13, a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for RhoA and Cdc42, inhibits astrocytoma cell migration through modulating focal adhesion dynamics and cell adhesion. This effect is mediated by the resulting constitutive activation of RhoA and the subsequent indirect inhibition of Rac. Using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF)-based Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), we show that RhoA activity localizes with focal adhesions at the basal surface of astrocytoma cells. Moreover, the knock down of StarD13 inhibits the cycling of RhoA activation at the rear edge of cells, which makes them defective in retracting their tail. This study highlights the importance of the regulation of RhoA activity in focal adhesions of astrocytoma cells and establishes StarD13 as a GAP playing a major role in this process.

Abstract: Summary
Disrupted IKAROS activity is a recurrent feature of some human leukemias, but effects on normal human hematopoietic cells are largely unknown. Here, we used lentivirally mediated expression of a dominant-negative isoform of IKAROS (IK6) to block normal IKAROS activity in primitive human cord blood cells and their progeny. This produced a marked (10-fold) increase in serially transplantable multipotent IK6+ cells as well as increased outputs of normally differentiating B cells and granulocytes in transplanted immunodeficient mice, without producing leukemia. Accompanying T/natural killer (NK) cell outputs were unaltered, and erythroid and platelet production was reduced. Mechanistically, IK6 specifically increased human granulopoietic progenitor sensitivity to two growth factors and activated CREB and its targets (c-FOS and Cyclin B1). In more primitive human cells, IK6 prematurely initiated a B cell transcriptional program without affecting the hematopoietic stem cell-associated gene expression profile. Some of these effects were species specific, thus identifying novel roles of IKAROS in regulating normal human hematopoietic cells.

Interaction of heat shock protein 70 with membranes depends on the lipid environment,

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (hsp) are well recognized for their protein folding activity. Additionally, hsp expression is enhanced during stress conditions to preserve cellular homeostasis. Hsp are also detected outside cells, released by an active mechanism independent of cell death. Extracellular hsp appear to act as signaling molecules as part of a systemic response to stress. Extracellular hsp do not contain a consensus signal for their secretion via the classical ER-Golgi compartment. Therefore, they are likely exported by an alternative mechanism requiring translocation across the plasma membrane. Since Hsp70, the major inducible hsp, has been detected on surface of stressed cells, we propose that membrane interaction is the first step in the export process. The question that emerges is how does this charged cytosolic protein interact with lipid membranes? Prior studies have shown that Hsp70 formed ion conductance pathways within artificial lipid bilayers. These early observations have been extended herewith using a liposome insertion assay. We showed that Hsp70 selectively interacted with negatively charged phospholipids, particularly phosphatidyl serine (PS), within liposomes, which was followed by insertion into the lipid bilayer, forming high-molecular weight oligomers. Hsp70 displayed a preference for less fluid lipid environments and the region embedded into the lipid membrane was mapped toward the C-terminus end of the molecule. The results from our studies provide evidence of an unexpected ability of a large, charged protein to become inserted into a lipid membrane. This observation provides a new paradigm for the interaction of proteins with lipid environments. In addition, it may explain the export mechanism of an increasing number of proteins that lack the consensus secretory signals.

Low cytoplasmic pH reduces ER-Golgi trafficking and induces disassembly of the Golgi apparatus,

Abstract: The Golgi apparatus was dramatically disassembled when cells were incubated in a low pH medium. The cis-Golgi disassembled quickly, extended tubules and spread to the periphery of cells within 30min. In contrast, medial- and trans-Golgi were fragmented in significantly larger structures of smaller numbers at a slower rate and remained largely in structures distinct from the cis-Golgi. Electron microscopy revealed the complete disassembly of the Golgi stack in low pH treated cells. The effect of low pH was reversible; the Golgi apparatus reassembled to form a normal ribbon-like structure within 1–2h after the addition of a control medium. The anterograde ER to Golgi transport and retrograde Golgi to ER transport were both reduced under low pH. Phospholipase A2 inhibitors (ONO, BEL) effectively suppressed the Golgi disassembly, suggesting that the phospholipase A2 was involved in the Golgi disassembly. Over-expression of Rab1, 2, 30, 33 and 41 also suppressed the Golgi disassembly under low pH, suggesting that they have protective role against Golgi disassembly. Low pH treatment reduced cytoplasmic pH, but not the luminal pH of the Golgi apparatus, strongly suggesting that reduction of the cytoplasmic pH triggered the Golgi disassembly. Because a lower cytoplasmic pH is induced in physiological or pathological conditions, disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and reduction of vesicular transport through the Golgi apparatus may play important roles in cell physiology and pathology. Furthermore, our findings indicated that low pH treatment can serve as an important tool to analyze the molecular mechanisms that support the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy and one of the leading causes of cancer deaths. The high mortality rate is mostly due to the lack of appropriate tools for early detection of the disease and a shortage of effective therapies. We have previously shown that karyopherin alpha 7 (KPNA7), the newest member of the alpha karyopherin family of nuclear import receptors, is frequently amplified and overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. Here, we report that KPNA7 expression is absent in practically all normal human adult tissues but elevated in several pancreatic cancer cell lines. Inhibition of KPNA7 expression in AsPC-1 and Hs700T pancreatic cancer cells led to a reduction in cell growth and decreased anchorage independent growth, as well as increased autophagy. The cell growth effects were accompanied by an induction of the cell cycle regulator p21 and a G1 arrest of the cell cycle. Interestingly, the p21 induction was caused by increased mRNA synthesis and not defective nuclear transport. These data strongly demonstrate that KPNA7 silencing inhibits the malignant properties of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and thereby provide the first evidence on the functional role for KPNA7 in human cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular surveillance-activated detoxification and defenses (cSADD) theory postulates the presence of host surveillance mechanisms that monitor the integrity of common cellular processes and components targeted by pathogen effectors. Being organelles essential for multiple cellular processes, including innate immune responses, mitochondria represent an attractive target for pathogens. We describe a Vibrio cholerae Type 3 secretion system effector VopE that localizes to mitochondria during infection and acts as a specific GTPase-activating protein to interfere with the function of mitochondrial Rho GTPases Miro1 and Miro2. Miro GTPases modulate mitochondrial dynamics and interfering with this functionality effectively blocks innate immune responses that presumably require mitochondria as signaling platforms. Our data indicate that interference with mitochondrial dynamics may be an unappreciated strategy that pathogens use to block host innate immune responses that would otherwise control these bacterial infections. VopE might represent a bacterial effector that targets the cSADD surveillance response.

Abstract: Dysfunctional stem cell differentiation into placental lineages is associated with gestational diseases. Of the differentiated lineages available to trophoblast stem cells (TSC), elevated O2 and mitochondrial function are necessary to placental lineages at the maternal–placental surface and important in the etiology of preeclampsia. TSC lineage imbalance leads to embryonic failure during uterine implantation. Stress at implantation exacerbates stem cell depletion by decreasing proliferation and increasing differentiation. In an implantation site O2 is normally ~2%. In culture, exposure to 2% O2 and fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) enabled the highest mouse TSC multipotency and proliferation. In contrast, hypoxic stress (0.5% O2) initiated the most TSC differentiation after 24h despite exposure to FGF4. However, hypoxic stress supported differentiation poorly after 4–7days, despite FGF4 removal. At all tested O2 levels, FGF4 maintained Warburg metabolism; mitochondrial inactivity and aerobic glycolysis. However, hypoxic stress suppressed mitochondrial membrane potential and maintained low mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (oxidative phosphorylation/OxPhos), and high pyruvate kinase M2 (glycolysis) despite FGF4 removal. Inhibiting OxPhos inhibited optimum differentiation at 20% O2. Moreover, adding differentiation-inducing hyperosmolar stress failed to induce differentiation during hypoxia. Thus, differentiation depended on OxPhos at 20% O2; hypoxic and hyperosmolar stresses did not induce differentiation at 0.5% O2. Hypoxia-limited differentiation and mitochondrial inhibition and activation suggest that differentiation into two lineages of the labyrinthine placenta requires O2>0.5–2% and mitochondrial function. Stress-activated protein kinase increases an early lineage and suppresses later lineages in proportion to the deviation from optimal O2 for multipotency, thus it is the first enzyme reported to prioritize differentiation.

Abstract: Pancreatic tumors contain cancer stem cells highly resistant to chemotherapy. The identification of therapies that can eliminate this population of cells might provide with more effective treatments. In the current work we evaluated the potential of oncolytic adenoviruses to act against pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSC). PCSC from two patient-derived xenograft models were isolated from orthotopic pancreatic tumors treated with saline, or with the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine. An enrichment in the number of PCSC expressing the cell surface marker CD133 and a marked enhancement on tumorsphere formation was observed in gemcitabine treated tumors. No significant increase in the CD44, CD24, and epithelial-specific antigen (ESA) positive cells was observed. Neoplastic sphere-forming cells were susceptible to adenoviral infection and exposure to oncolytic adenoviruses resulted in elevated cytotoxicity with both Adwt and the tumor specific AduPARE1A adenovirus. In vivo, intravenous administration of a single dose of AduPARE1A in human-derived pancreatic xenografts led to a remarkable anti-tumor effect. In contrast to gemcitabine AduPARE1A treatment did not result in PCSC enrichment. No enrichment on tumorspheres neither on the CD133+ population was detected. Therefore our data provide evidences of the relevance of uPAR-controlled oncolytic adenoviruses for the elimination of pancreatic cancer stem cells.

Bone Marrow Endosteal Mesenchymal Progenitors Depend on HIF Factors for Maintenance and Regulation of Hematopoiesis,

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is regulated through cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms within specialized bone marrow microenvironments. Recent evidence demonstrates that signaling by HIF-1α contributes to cell-autonomous regulation of HSC maintenance. By investigating the role of HIF factors in bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors, we found that murine endosteal mesenchymal progenitors express high levels of HIF-1α and HIF-2α and proliferate preferentially in hypoxic conditions ex vivo. Inactivation of either HIF-1α or HIF-2α dramatically affects their phenotype, propagation, and differentiation. Also, downregulation of HIF factors provokes an increase in interferon-responsive genes and triggers expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors by a STAT1-mediated mechanism. Interestingly, in conditions of demand-driven hematopoiesis HIF factors are specifically downregulated in mesenchymal progenitors in vivo. In conclusion, our findings indicate that HIF factors also regulate hematopoiesis non-cell-autonomously by preventing activation of a latent program in mesenchymal progenitors that promotes hematopoiesis.

Side population sorting separates subfractions of cycling and non-cycling intestinal stem cells,

Abstract: We report here that side population (SP) sorting allows for the simultaneous isolation of two intestinal stem cell (ISC) subsets from wild-type (WT) mice which are phenotypically different and represent cycling and non-cycling pools of cells. Following 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) injection, in the upper side population (USP) the percentage of EdU+ was 36% showing this fraction to be highly proliferative. In the lower side population (LSP), only 0.4% of cells were EdU+, indicating this fraction to be predominantly non-cycling. Using Lgr5-EGFP mice, we show that Lgr5-EGFPhi cells, representing actively cycling ISCs, are essentially exclusive to the USP. In contrast, using histone 2B-YFP mice, SP analysis revealed YFP label retaining cells (LRCs) in both the USP and the LSP. Correspondingly, evaluation of the SP fractions for mRNA markers by qRT-PCR showed that the USP was enriched in transcripts associated with both quiescent and active ISCs. In contrast, the LSP expressed mRNA markers of quiescent ISCs while being de-enriched for those of the active ISC. Both the USP and LSP are capable of generating enteroids in culture which include the four intestinal lineages. We conclude that sorting of USP and LSP fractions represents a novel isolation of cycling and non-cycling ISCs from WT mice.

Abstract: Stem cells, especially human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), are useful models to study molecular mechanisms of human disorders that originate during gestation. Alcohol (ethanol, EtOH) consumption during pregnancy causes a variety of prenatal and postnatal disorders collectively referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). To better understand the molecular events leading to FASDs, we performed a genome-wide analysis of EtOH's effects on the maintenance and differentiation of hESCs in culture. Gene Co-expression Network Analysis showed significant alterations in gene profiles of EtOH-treated differentiated or undifferentiated hESCs, particularly those associated with molecular pathways for metabolic processes, oxidative stress, and neuronal properties of stem cells. A genome-wide DNA methylome analysis revealed widespread EtOH-induced alterations with significant hypermethylation of many regions of chromosomes. Undifferentiated hESCs were more vulnerable to EtOH's effect than their differentiated counterparts, with methylation on the promoter regions of chromosomes 2, 16 and 18 in undifferentiated hESCs most affected by EtOH exposure. Combined transcriptomic and DNA methylomic analysis produced a list of differentiation-related genes dysregulated by EtOH-induced DNA methylation changes, which likely play a role in EtOH-induced decreases in hESC pluripotency. DNA sequence motif analysis of genes epigenetically altered by EtOH identified major motifs representing potential binding sites for transcription factors. These findings should help in deciphering the precise mechanisms of alcohol-induced teratogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Transplantation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is being developed as a cell-replacement therapy for age-related macular degeneration. Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE are currently translating toward clinic. We introduce the adult human RPE stem cell (hRPESC) as an alternative RPE source. Polarized monolayers of adult hRPESC-derived RPE grown on polyester (PET) membranes had near-native characteristics. Trephined pieces of RPE monolayers on PET were transplanted subretinally in the rabbit, a large-eyed animal model. After 4 days, retinal edema was observed above the implant, detected by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and fundoscopy. At 1 week, retinal atrophy overlying the fetal or adult transplant was observed, remaining stable thereafter. Histology obtained 4 weeks after implantation confirmed a continuous polarized human RPE monolayer on PET. Taken together, the xeno-RPE survived with retained characteristics in the subretinal space. These experiments support that adult hRPESC-derived RPE are a potential source for transplantation therapies.

Abstract: Identification of new drugs and predicting drug response are major challenges in oncology, especially for brain tumors, because total surgical resection is difficult and radiation therapy or chemotherapy is often ineffective. With the aim of developing a culture system close to in vivo conditions for testing new drugs, we characterized an ex vivo three-dimensional culture system based on a hyaluronic acid-rich hydrogel and compared it with classical two-dimensional culture conditions. U87-MG glioblastoma cells and seven primary cell cultures of human glioblastomas were subjected to radiation therapy and chemotherapy drugs. It appears that 3D hydrogel preserves the original cancer growth behavior and enables assessment of the sensitivity of malignant gliomas to radiation and drugs with regard to inter-tumoral heterogeneity of therapeutic response. It could be used for preclinical assessment of new therapies.
