Abstract: Summary
In metazoa, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are assembled from constituent nucleoporins by two distinct mechanisms: in the re-forming nuclear envelope at the end of mitosis and into the intact nuclear envelope during interphase. Here, we show that the nucleoporin Nup153 is required for NPC assembly during interphase but not during mitotic exit. It functions in interphasic NPC formation by binding directly to the inner nuclear membrane via an N-terminal amphipathic helix. This binding facilitates the recruitment of the Nup107-160 complex, a crucial structural component of the NPC, to assembly sites. Our work further suggests that the nuclear transport receptor transportin and the small GTPase Ran regulate the interaction of Nup153 with the membrane and, in this way, direct pore complex assembly to the nuclear envelope during interphase.

Abstract: Summary
The possibility of directly converting non-neuronal cells into neurons in situ in the brain would open therapeutic avenues aimed at repairing the brain after injury or degenerative disease. We have developed an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based reporter system that allows selective GFP labeling of reprogrammed neurons. In this system, GFP is turned on only in reprogrammed neurons where it is stable and maintained for long time periods, allowing for histological and functional characterization of mature neurons. When combined with a modified rabies virus-based trans-synaptic tracing methodology, the system allows mapping of 3D circuitry integration into local and distal brain regions and shows that the newly reprogrammed neurons are integrated into host brain.

Abstract: Summary
Ankrd11 is a potential chromatin regulator implicated in neural development and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with no known function in the brain. Here, we show that knockdown of Ankrd11 in developing murine or human cortical neural precursors caused decreased proliferation, reduced neurogenesis, and aberrant neuronal positioning. Similar cellular phenotypes and aberrant ASD-like behaviors were observed in Yoda mice carrying a point mutation in the Ankrd11 HDAC-binding domain. Consistent with a role for Ankrd11 in histone acetylation, Ankrd11 was associated with chromatin and colocalized with HDAC3, and expression and histone acetylation of Ankrd11 target genes were altered in Yoda neural precursors. Moreover, the Ankrd11 knockdown-mediated decrease in precursor proliferation was rescued by inhibiting histone acetyltransferase activity or expressing HDAC3. Thus, Ankrd11 is a crucial chromatin regulator that controls histone acetylation and gene expression during neural development, thereby providing a likely explanation for its association with cognitive dysfunction and ASD.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how brain activation mediates behaviors is a central goal of systems neuroscience. Here, we apply an automated method for mapping brain activation in the mouse in order to probe how sex-specific social behaviors are represented in the male brain. Our method uses the immediate-early-gene c-fos, a marker of neuronal activation, visualized by serial two-photon tomography: the c-fos-GFP+ neurons are computationally detected, their distribution is registered to a reference brain and a brain atlas, and their numbers are analyzed by statistical tests. Our results reveal distinct and shared female and male interaction-evoked patterns of male brain activation representing sex discrimination and social recognition. We also identify brain regions whose degree of activity correlates to specific features of social behaviors and estimate the total numbers and the densities of activated neurons per brain areas. Our study opens the door to automated screening of behavior-evoked brain activation in the mouse.

Abstract: Summary
The sophisticated organization of eusocial insect societies is largely based on the regulation of complex behaviors by hydrocarbon pheromones present on the cuticle. We used electrophysiology to investigate the detection of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) by female-specific olfactory sensilla basiconica on the antenna of Camponotus floridanus ants through the utilization of one of the largest family of odorant receptors characterized so far in insects. These sensilla, each of which contains multiple olfactory receptor neurons, are differentially sensitive to CHCs and allow them to be classified into three broad groups that collectively detect every hydrocarbon tested, including queen and worker-enriched CHCs. This broad-spectrum sensitivity is conserved in a related species, Camponotus laevigatus, allowing these ants to detect CHCs from both nestmates and non-nestmates. Behavioral assays demonstrate that these ants are excellent at discriminating CHCs detected by the antenna, including enantiomers of a candidate queen pheromone that regulates the reproductive division of labor.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial H+-ATP synthase synthesizes most of cellular ATP requirements by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The ATPase Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1) is known to inhibit the hydrolase activity of the H+-ATP synthase in situations that compromise OXPHOS. Herein, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of S39 in IF1 by mitochondrial protein kinase A abolishes its capacity to bind the H+-ATP synthase. Only dephosphorylated IF1 binds and inhibits both the hydrolase and synthase activities of the enzyme. The phosphorylation status of IF1 regulates the flux of aerobic glycolysis and ATP production through OXPHOS in hypoxia and during the cell cycle. Dephosphorylated IF1 is present in human carcinomas. Remarkably, mouse heart contains a large fraction of dephosphorylated IF1 that becomes phosphorylated and inactivated upon in vivo β-adrenergic stimulation. Overall, we demonstrate the essential function of the phosphorylation of IF1 in regulating energy metabolism and speculate that dephosho-IF1 might play a role in signaling mitohormesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cytokines play a pivotal role in regulating tumor immunogenicity and antitumor immunity. IL-36γ is important for the IL-23/IL-17-dominated inflammation and anti-BCG Th1 immune responses. However, the impact of IL-36γ on tumor immunity is unknown. Here we found that IL-36γ stimulated CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and γδ T cells synergistically with TCR signaling and/or IL-12. Importantly, IL-36γ exerted profound antitumor effects in vivo and transformed the tumor microenvironment in favor of tumor eradication. Furthermore, IL-36γ strongly increased the efficacy of tumor vaccination. Moreover, IL-36γ expression inversely correlated with the progression of human melanoma and lung cancer. Our study establishes a role of IL-36γ in promoting antitumor immune responses and suggests its potential clinical translation into cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
ATR, a PI3K-like protein kinase, plays a key role in regulating DNA damage responses. Its nuclear checkpoint kinase function is well documented, but little is known about its function outside the nucleus. Here we report that ATR has an antiapoptotic activity at mitochondria in response to UV damage, and this activity is independent of its hallmark checkpoint/kinase activity and partner ATRIP. ATR contains a BH3-like domain that allows ATR-tBid interaction at mitochondria, suppressing cytochrome c release and apoptosis. This mitochondrial activity of ATR is downregulated by Pin1 that isomerizes ATR from cis-isomer to trans-isomer at the phosphorylated Ser428-Pro429 motif. However, UV inactivates Pin1 via DAPK1, stabilizing the pro-survival cis-isomeric ATR. In contrast, nuclear ATR remains in the trans-isoform disregarding UV. This cytoplasmic response of ATR may provide a mechanism for the observed antiapoptotic role of ATR in suppressing carcinogenesis and its inhibition in sensitizing anticancer agents for killing of cancer cells.

Abstract: Localized endothelial Ca2+ signalling, such as Ca2+ pulsars, can modulate the contractile state of the underlying vascular smooth muscle cell through specific endothelial targets. In addition to KCa3.1 as a target, Ca2+ pulsars, an IP3R-dependent pulsatile Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) could activate a frequency-sensitive Ca2+-dependent kinase such as CaMKII. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, acetylcholine increased endothelial CaMKII phosphorylation and activation, thereby suggesting CaMKII activation independently of Ca2+ influx. Herein, a reciprocal relation where CaMKII controls endothelial Ca2+ dynamics has been investigated in mesenteric arteries. Both CaMKIIα and β isoforms have been identified in endothelial cells and close proximity (<40nm) suggests their association in heteromultimers. Intracellular Ca2+ monitoring with high speed confocal microscopy then showed that inhibition of CaMKII with KN-93 significantly increased the population of Ca2+ pulsars active sites (+89%), suggesting CaMKII as a major regulator of Ca2+ pulsars in native endothelium. Mechanistic insights were then sought through the elucidation of the impact of CaMKII on ER Ca2+ store. ER Ca2+ emptying was accelerated by CaMKII inhibition and ER Ca2+ content was assessed using ionomycin. Exposure to KN-93 strongly diminished ER Ca2+ content (−61%) by relieving CaMKII-dependent inhibition of IP3 receptors (IP3R). Moreover, in situ proximity ligation assay suggested CaMKII-IP3R promiscuity, essential condition for a protein–protein interaction. Interestingly, segregation of IP3R within myoendothelial projection (MEP) appears to be isoform-specific. Hence, only IP3R type 1 and type 2 are detected within fenestrations of the internal elastic lamina, sites of MEP, whilst type 3 is absent from these structures. In summary, CaMKII seems to act as a Ca2+-sensitive switch of a negative feedback loop regulating endothelial Ca2+ homeostasis, including Ca2+ pulsars.

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo pathway is a conserved signaling cascade that modulates tissue growth. Although its core elements are well defined, factors modulating Hippo transcriptional outputs remain elusive. Here we show that components of the steroid-responsive ecdysone (Ec) pathway modulate Hippo transcriptional effects in imaginal disc cells. The Ec receptor coactivator Taiman (Tai) interacts with the Hippo transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki) and promotes expression of canonical Yki-responsive genes. Tai enhances Yki-driven growth, while Tai loss, or a form of Tai unable to bind Yki, suppresses Yki-driven tissue growth. This growth suppression is not correlated with impaired induction of canonical Hippo-responsive genes but with suppression of a distinct pro-growth program of Yki-induced/Tai-dependent genes, including the germline stem cell factors nanos and piwi. These data reveal Hippo/Ec pathway crosstalk in the form a Yki-Tai complex that collaboratively induces germline genes as part of a transcriptional program that is normally repressed in developing somatic epithelia.

Abstract: Summary
Glaucoma, a blinding neurodegenerative disease, whose risk factors include elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), age, and genetics, is characterized by accelerated and progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death. Despite decades of research, the mechanism of RGC death in glaucoma is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the genetic effect of the SIX6 risk variant (rs33912345, His141Asn) is enhanced by another major POAG risk gene, p16INK4a (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, isoform INK4a). We further show that the upregulation of homozygous SIX6 risk alleles (CC) leads to an increase in p16INK4a expression, with subsequent cellular senescence, as evidenced in a mouse model of elevated IOP and in human POAG eyes. Our data indicate that SIX6 and/or IOP promotes POAG by directly increasing p16INK4a expression, leading to RGC senescence in adult human retinas. Our study provides important insights linking genetic susceptibility to the underlying mechanism of RGC death and provides a unified theory of glaucoma pathogenesis.

Abstract: The aim of the research, carried out on three species of terrestrial isopods – Armadillidium granulatum, Halophiloscia hirsuta and Trichoniscus alexandrae – is to bring a first consistent contribution to the knowledge of the ultrastructural organization of the testis follicles. The testis follicles are seat of a remarkable dynamic activity of their cell components (somatic cells and germ cells) that results in a continuous variation, related to the trend of spermatogenesis, of their morphology, organization and of the relationships between the two cell populations. The somatic cells, known in literature as follicular cells, nurse cells or Sertoli cells, are arranged at the periphery of the follicle to form an epithelial layer of variable thickness resting on a thin basal lamina in turn surrounded by a discontinuous network of muscle cells. In A. granulatum and H. hirsuta, two types of Sertoli cells are present: a first type, the nurse cells, envelop the spermatids in cavities within their cytoplasm and through their secretion activity play a fundamental role in the formation of the spermatophores; moreover, they phagocytizes the residual cytoplasm of spermatids. A second type of Sertoli cells shows features that leave clearly identify its supporting role to the spermatophores in formation. In T. alexandrae, instead, only one type of Sertoli cells, the nurse cell, is present, whose features are widely superimposable to those observed in the other two species. Moreover, two septa of Sertoli cells depart from the periphery of the testis follicle to constitute an articulated compartmentalization of the follicle itself, probably targeted to realize at its inside a series of microenvironments functionally diversified in order to meets the needs of the different stages of the spermatogenic cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters human hepatocytes through a multistep mechanism involving, among other host proteins, the virus receptor CD81. How CD81 governs HCV entry is poorly characterized, and CD81 protein interactions after virus binding remain elusive. We have developed a quantitative proteomics protocol to identify HCV-triggered CD81 interactions and found 26 dynamic binding partners. At least six of these proteins promote HCV infection, as indicated by RNAi. We further characterized serum response factor binding protein 1 (SRFBP1), which is recruited to CD81 during HCV uptake and supports HCV infection in hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes. SRFBP1 facilitates host cell penetration by all seven HCV genotypes, but not of vesicular stomatitis virus and human coronavirus. Thus, SRFBP1 is an HCV-specific, pan-genotypic host entry factor. These results demonstrate the use of quantitative proteomics to elucidate pathogen entry and underscore the importance of host protein-protein interactions during HCV invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Tie1 is a mechanistically poorly characterized endothelial cell (EC)-specific orphan receptor. Yet, Tie1 deletion is embryonic lethal and Tie1 has been implicated in critical vascular pathologies, including atherosclerosis and tumor angiogenesis. Here, we show that Tie1 does not function independently but exerts context-dependent effects on the related receptor Tie2. Tie1 was identified as an EC activation marker that is expressed during angiogenesis by a subset of angiogenic tip and remodeling stalk cells and downregulated in the adult quiescent vasculature. Functionally, Tie1 expression by angiogenic EC contributes to shaping the tip cell phenotype by negatively regulating Tie2 surface presentation. In contrast, Tie1 acts in remodeling stalk cells cooperatively to sustain Tie2 signaling. Collectively, our data support an interactive model of Tie1 and Tie2 function, in which dynamically regulated Tie1 versus Tie2 expression determines the net positive or negative effect of Tie1 on Tie2 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
mTORC1 controls key processes that regulate cell growth, including mRNA translation, ribosome biogenesis, and autophagy. Environmental amino acids activate mTORC1 by promoting its recruitment to the cytosolic surface of the lysosome, where its kinase is activated downstream of growth factor signaling. mTORC1 is brought to the lysosome by the Rag GTPases, which are tethered to the lysosomal membrane by Ragulator, a lysosome-bound scaffold. Here, we identify c17orf59 as a Ragulator-interacting protein that regulates mTORC1 activity through its interaction with Ragulator at the lysosome. The binding of c17orf59 to Ragulator prevents Ragulator interaction with the Rag GTPases, both in cells and in vitro, and decreases Rag GTPase lysosomal localization. Disruption of the Rag-Ragulator interaction by c17orf59 impairs mTORC1 activation by amino acids by preventing mTOR from reaching the lysosome. By disrupting the Rag-Ragulator interaction to inhibit mTORC1, c17orf59 expression may represent another mechanism to modulate nutrient sensing by mTORC1.

Abstract: Inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-mediated intracellular Ca2+ increase is the major Ca2+ signaling pathway in astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). Ca2+ increases in astrocytes have been found to modulate neuronal function through gliotransmitter release. We previously demonstrated that astrocytes exhibit enhanced Ca2+ signaling in vivo after photothrombosis (PT)-induced ischemia, which is largely due to the activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The aim of this study is to investigate the role of astrocytic IP3R-mediated Ca2+ signaling in neuronal death, brain damage and behavior outcomes after PT. For this purpose, we conducted experiments using homozygous type 2 IP3R (IP3R2) knockout (KO) mice. Histological and immunostaining studies showed that IP3R2 KO mice were indeed deficient in IP3R2 in astrocytes and exhibited normal brain cytoarchitecture. IP3R2 KO mice also had the same densities of S100β+ astrocytes and NeuN+ neurons in the cortices, and exhibited the same glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glial glutamate transporter (GLT-1) levels in the cortices and hippocampi as compared with wild type (WT) mice. Two-photon (2-P) imaging showed that IP3R2 KO mice did not exhibit ATP-induced Ca2+ waves in vivo in the astrocytic network, which verified the disruption of IP3R-mediated Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes of these mice. When subject to PT, IP3R2 KO mice had smaller infarction than WT mice in acute and chronic phases of ischemia. IP3R2 KO mice also exhibited less neuronal apoptosis, reactive astrogliosis, and tissue loss than WT mice. Behavioral tests, including cylinder, hanging wire, pole and adhesive tests, showed that IP3R2 KO mice exhibited reduced functional deficits after PT. Collectively, our study demonstrates that disruption of astrocytic Ca2+ signaling by deleting IP3R2s has beneficial effects on neuronal and brain protection and functional deficits after stroke. These findings reveal a novel non-cell-autonomous neuronal and brain protective function of astrocytes in ischemic stroke, whereby suggest that the astrocytic IP3R2-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway might be a promising target for stroke therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The interest in brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a target to combat metabolic disease has recently been renewed with the discovery of functional BAT in humans. In rodents, BAT can be activated by bile acids, which activate type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) in BAT via the G-coupled protein receptor TGR5, resulting in increased oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. Here we examined the effects of oral supplementation of the bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) on human BAT activity. Treatment of 12 healthy female subjects with CDCA for 2 days resulted in increased BAT activity. Whole-body energy expenditure was also increased upon CDCA treatment. In vitro treatment of primary human brown adipocytes derived with CDCA or specific TGR5 agonists increased mitochondrial uncoupling and D2 expression, an effect that was absent in human primary white adipocytes. These findings identify bile acids as a target to activate BAT in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Several terminal uridyltransferases (TUTases) are known to modulate small RNA biogenesis and/or function via diverse mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila splicing-derived pre-miRNAs (mirtrons) are efficiently modified by the previously uncharacterized TUTase, Tailor. Tailor is necessary and sufficient for mirtron hairpin uridylation, and this modification inhibits mirtron biogenesis. Genome-wide analyses demonstrate that mirtrons are dominant Tailor substrates, and three features contribute to substrate specificity. First, reprogramming experiments show Tailor preferentially identifies splicing-derived miRNAs. Second, in vitro tests indicate Tailor prefers substrate hairpins over mature miRNAs. Third, Tailor exhibits sequence preference for 3′-terminal AG, a defining mirtron characteristic. Our work supports the notion that Tailor preferentially suppresses biogenesis of mirtrons, an evolutionarily adventitious pre-miRNA substrate class. Moreover, we detect preferential activity of Tailor on 3′-G canonical pre-miRNAs, and specific depletion of such loci from the pool of conserved miRNAs. Thus, Tailor activity may have had collateral impact on shaping populations of canonical miRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogen-receptor alpha (ERα) neurons in the ventrolateral region of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHVL) control an array of sex-specific responses to maximize reproductive success. In females, these VMHVL neurons are believed to coordinate metabolism and reproduction. However, it remains unknown whether specific neuronal populations control distinct components of this physiological repertoire. Here, we identify a subset of ERα VMHVL neurons that promotes hormone-dependent female locomotion. Activating Nkx2-1-expressing VMHVL neurons via pharmacogenetics elicits a female-specific burst of spontaneous movement, which requires ERα and Tac1 signaling. Disrupting the development of Nkx2-1+ VMHVL neurons results in female-specific obesity, inactivity, and loss of VMHVL neurons coexpressing ERα and Tac1. Unexpectedly, two responses controlled by ERα+ neurons, fertility and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, are unaffected. We conclude that a dedicated subset of VMHVL neurons marked by ERα, NKX2-1, and Tac1 regulates estrogen-dependent fluctuations in physical activity and constitutes one of several neuroendocrine modules that drive sex-specific responses.

Abstract: Depletion of intracellular calcium ion stores initiates a rapid cascade of events culminating with the activation of the so-called Store-Operated Channels (SOC) at the plasma membrane. Calcium influx via SOC is essential in the initiation of calcium-dependent intracellular signaling and for the refilling of internal calcium stores, ensuring the regeneration of the signaling cascade. In spite of the significance of this evolutionary conserved mechanism, the molecular identity of SOC has been the center of a heated controversy spanning over the last 20 years. Initial studies positioned some members of the transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channel superfamily of channels (with the more robust evidence pointing to TRPC1) as a putative SOC. Recent evidence indicates that Stromal Interacting Molecule 1 (STIM1) activates some members from the TRPC family of channels. However, the exact subunit composition of TRPC channels remains undetermined to this date. To identify the subunit composition of STIM1-activated TRPC channels, we developed novel method, which combines single channel electrophysiological measurements based on the patch clamp technique with single molecule fluorescence imaging. We termed this method Single ion Channel Single Molecule Detection technique (SC-SMD). Using SC-SMD method, we have obtained direct evidence of the subunit composition of TRPC channels activated by STIM1. Furthermore, our electrophysiological-imaging SC-SMD method provides evidence at the molecular level of the mechanism by which STIM1 and calmodulin antagonize to modulate TRPC channel activity.

Abstract: Fibrin glue (FG) is used in a variety of clinical applications and in the laboratory for localized and sustained release of factors potentially important for tissue engineering. The aim of this study was to evaluate FG scaffold effect on differentiation of insulin-producing cells (IPCs) from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). In this experimental study BM-MSCs were cultured and the cells characterized by analysis of cell surface markers using flow cytometry. BM-MSCs were seeded in FG scaffold (3D culture) and then treated with induction media. After induction, the presence of IPCs was demonstrated using gene expression profiles for pancreatic cell differentiation markers (PDX-1, GLUT-2 and insulin) and insulin detection in cytoplasm. Release of insulin by these cells was confirmed by radioimmunoassay. Expression of the islet-associated genes PDX-1, GLUT-2 and Insulin genes in 3D cultured cells was markedly higher than the 2D cultured cells exposure differentiation media. Compared to 2D culture of BM-MSCs-derived IPCs, the insulin release from 3D BM-MSCs-derived IPCs showed a nearly 3 fold (p<0.05) increase when exposed to a high glucose (25mM) medium. Percentage of insulin positive cells in 3D experimental group showed an approximately 3.5-fold increase in compared to 2D experimental culture cells. The results of this study demonstrated that FG scaffold can enhance the differentiation of IPCs from rats BM-MSCs.

Abstract: To investigate the involvement of stress-activated protein kinases, JNK and p38 MAPK, in the assembly of tight junctions in keratinocytes, we treated HaCaT cells with various combinations of SP600125 (an inhibitor of JNK), SB202190 (an inhibitor of p38 MAPK) and anisomycin (an activator of both JNK and p38 MAPK) and examined the localization of ZO-1, an undercoat constitutive protein of the tight junction. Short-term (8h) incubation with SP600125, SB202190 or anisomycin induced the accumulation of ZO-1 in the cell–cell contacts, with reduced ZO-1 staining in the cytoplasm, while only long-term (24h) incubation with SP600125 induced the accumulation of ZO-1. SP600125, SB202190 or SP600125 plus SB202190 treatment induced thin linear staining for ZO-1 in the cell–cell contacts. Anisomycin treatment induced thick and irregular linear staining for ZO-1, while anisomycin plus SP600125 treatment induced zipper-like staining for ZO-1. Anisomycin plus SB202190 treatment or anisomycin plus both SP600125 and SB202190 treatment for 8h failed to lead to the accumulation of ZO-1 in cell–cell contacts, but induced thin linear staining with several gaps 16h after removal of these agents. These results suggest that the localization of ZO-1 in cell–cell contacts is differently regulated by activation and inhibition of JNK and/or p38 MAPK depending on the incubation period.

Abstract: Summary
Basal-like and luminal breast tumors have distinct clinical behavior and molecular profiles, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. To interrogate processes that determine these distinct phenotypes and their inheritance pattern, we generated somatic cell fusions and performed integrated genetic and epigenetic (DNA methylation and chromatin) profiling. We found that the basal-like trait is generally dominant and is largely defined by epigenetic repression of luminal transcription factors. Definition of super-enhancers highlighted a core program common in luminal cells but a high degree of heterogeneity in basal-like breast cancers that correlates with clinical outcome. We also found that protein extracts of basal-like cells are sufficient to induce a luminal-to-basal phenotypic switch, implying a trigger of basal-like autoregulatory circuits. We determined that KDM6A might be required for luminal-basal fusions, and we identified EN1, TBX18, and TCF4 as candidate transcriptional regulators of the luminal-to-basal switch. Our findings highlight the remarkable epigenetic plasticity of breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is associated with higher incidence of cancer, but the predisposing mechanisms remain poorly understood. The NAD+-dependent deacetylase SirT1 orchestrates metabolism, cellular survival, and growth. However, there is no unifying mechanism to explain the metabolic and tumor-related effects of SirT1. In this work, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of the endogenous inhibitor of SirT1, Deleted-in-Breast-Cancer-1 (Dbc1), unexpectedly results in obesity and insulin resistance. Dbc1 deficiency promoted SirT1-dependent gain of function of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (Scd1), increasing plasma and tissue levels of unsaturated fatty acids. The metabolic abnormalities in Dbc1–/– mice were reversed by ablation of hepatic SirT1 or by inhibition of Scd1 activity. Furthermore, loss of Dbc1 impaired activation of the master tumor suppressor p53 and treatment with an Scd1 inhibitor extended survival of tumor-prone TP53–/– mice by decreasing tumor-related death. Together, our findings illustrate a shared mechanism of obesity and tumor progression mediated by hepatic SirT1 and resulting in the activation of a key lipid synthetic enzyme, with potential therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
Heritable epigenetic factors can contribute to complex disease etiology. Here we examine the contribution of DNA methylation to complex traits that are precursors to heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. We profiled DNA methylation in the liver using bisulfite sequencing in 90 mouse inbred strains, genome-wide expression levels, proteomics, metabolomics, and 68 clinical traits and performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). We found associations with numerous clinical traits including bone density, insulin resistance, expression, and protein and metabolite levels. A large proportion of associations were unique to EWAS and were not identified using GWAS. Methylation levels were regulated by genetics largely in cis, but we also found evidence of trans regulation, and we demonstrate that genetic variation in the methionine synthase reductase gene Mtrr affects methylation of hundreds of CpGs throughout the genome. Our results indicate that natural variation in methylation levels contributes to the etiology of complex clinical traits.

Abstract: Summary
The receptor tyrosine kinase KIT plays an important role in development of germ cells, hematopoietic cells, and interstitial pacemaker cells. Oncogenic KIT mutations play an important “driver” role in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, acute myeloid leukemias, and melanoma, among other cancers. Here we describe the crystal structure of a recurring somatic oncogenic mutation located in the C-terminal Ig-like domain (D5) of the ectodomain, rendering KIT tyrosine kinase activity constitutively activated. The structural analysis, together with biochemical and biophysical experiments and detailed analyses of the activities of a variety of oncogenic KIT mutations, reveals that the strength of homotypic contacts and the cooperativity in the action of D4D5 regions determines whether KIT is normally regulated or constitutively activated in cancers. We propose that cooperative interactions mediated by multiple weak homotypic contacts between receptor molecules are responsible for regulating normal ligand-dependent or oncogenic RTK activation via a “zipper-like” mechanism for receptor activation.

Using a method that permits library construction from any source of DNA, we generated guide libraries that label repetitive loci or a single chromosomal locus in Xenopus egg extracts and show that a complex library can target the E. coli genome at high frequency.

Abstract: Summary
The endolysosomal system is critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. However, how endolysosomal compartment is regulated by mitochondrial function is largely unknown. We have generated a mouse model with defective mitochondrial function in CD4+ T lymphocytes by genetic deletion of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam). Mitochondrial respiration deficiency impairs lysosome function, promotes p62 and sphingomyelin accumulation, and disrupts endolysosomal trafficking pathways and autophagy, thus linking a primary mitochondrial dysfunction to a lysosomal storage disorder. The impaired lysosome function in Tfam-deficient cells subverts T cell differentiation toward proinflammatory subsets and exacerbates the in vivo inflammatory response. Restoration of NAD+ levels improves lysosome function and corrects the inflammatory defects in Tfam-deficient T cells. Our results uncover a mechanism by which mitochondria regulate lysosome function to preserve T cell differentiation and effector functions, and identify strategies for intervention in mitochondrial-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Theoretical studies have shown that a deterministic biochemical oscillator can become chaotic when operating over a sufficiently large volume and have suggested that the Xenopus laevis cell cycle oscillator operates close to such a chaotic regime. To experimentally test this hypothesis, we decreased the speed of the post-fertilization calcium wave, which had been predicted to generate chaos. However, cell divisions were found to develop normally, and eggs developed into normal tadpoles. Motivated by these experiments, we carried out modeling studies to understand the prerequisites for the predicted spatial chaos. We showed that this type of spatial chaos requires oscillatory reaction dynamics with short pulse duration and postulated that the mitotic exit in Xenopus laevis is likely slow enough to avoid chaos. In systems with shorter pulses, chaos may be an important hazard, as in cardiac arrhythmias, or a useful feature, as in the pigmentation of certain mollusk shells.

Abstract: Summary
In Drosophila, two Piwi proteins, Aubergine (Aub) and Argonaute-3 (Ago3), localize to perinuclear “nuage” granules and use guide piRNAs to target and destroy transposable element transcripts. We find that Aub and Ago3 are recruited to nuage by two different mechanisms. Aub requires a piRNA guide for nuage recruitment, indicating that its localization depends on recognition of RNA targets. Ago3 is recruited to nuage independently of a piRNA cargo and relies on interaction with Krimper, a stable component of nuage that is able to aggregate in the absence of other nuage proteins. We show that Krimper interacts directly with Aub and Ago3 to coordinate the assembly of the ping-pong piRNA processing (4P) complex. Symmetrical dimethylated arginines are required for Aub to interact with Krimper, but they are dispensable for Ago3 to bind Krimper. Our study reveals a multi-step process responsible for the assembly and function of nuage complexes in piRNA-guided transposon repression.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise is essential in regulating energy metabolism and whole-body insulin sensitivity. To explore the exercise signaling network, we undertook a global analysis of protein phosphorylation in human skeletal muscle biopsies from untrained healthy males before and after a single high-intensity exercise bout, revealing 1,004 unique exercise-regulated phosphosites on 562 proteins. These included substrates of known exercise-regulated kinases (AMPK, PKA, CaMK, MAPK, mTOR), yet the majority of kinases and substrate phosphosites have not previously been implicated in exercise signaling. Given the importance of AMPK in exercise-regulated metabolism, we performed a targeted in vitro AMPK screen and employed machine learning to predict exercise-regulated AMPK substrates. We validated eight predicted AMPK substrates, including AKAP1, using targeted phosphoproteomics. Functional characterization revealed an undescribed role for AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of AKAP1 in mitochondrial respiration. These data expose the unexplored complexity of acute exercise signaling and provide insights into the role of AMPK in mitochondrial biochemistry.

Abstract: Summary
In adult tissues, stem and progenitor cells must balance proliferation and differentiation to maintain homeostasis. How this is done is unclear. Here, we show that the DEAD box RNA helicase, DDX6 is necessary for maintaining adult progenitor cell function. DDX6 loss results in premature differentiation and decreased proliferation of epidermal progenitor cells. To maintain self-renewal, DDX6 associates with YBX1 to bind the stem loops found in the 3′ UTRs of regulators of proliferation/self-renewal (CDK1, EZH2) and recruit them to EIF4E to facilitate their translation. To prevent premature differentiation of progenitor cells, DDX6 regulates the 5′ UTR of differentiation inducing transcription factor, KLF4 and degrades its transcripts through association with mRNA degradation proteins. Our results demonstrate that progenitor function is maintained by DDX6 complexes through two distinct pathways that include the degradation of differentiation-inducing transcripts and by promoting the translation of self-renewal and proliferation mRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Treatment of cancer patients with ATP-competitive inhibitors of BRAF/CRAF kinases surprisingly increases total kinase activity, especially in wild-type BRAF cells, subverting the desired clinical outcome. Similar inhibition resistance is observed for numerous kinases involving homo/heterodimerization in their activation cycles. Here, I demonstrate that drug resistance resulting from kinase dimerization can be explained using thermodynamic principles. I show that allosteric regulation by inhibitors is described by thermodynamic factors that quantify inhibitor-induced changes in kinase dimerization and the difference in the drug affinity for a free monomer versus a dimer harboring one drug molecule. The analysis extends to kinase homo- and heterodimers, allows for their symmetric and asymmetric conformations, and predicts how thermodynamic factors influence dose-response dependencies. I show how two inhibitors, ineffective on their own, when combined can abolish drug resistance at lower doses than either inhibitor applied alone. Thus, the mechanistic models suggest ways to overcome resistance to kinase inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Vacuolar protein sorting-35 (VPS35) is a retromer component for endosomal trafficking. Mutations of VPS35 have been linked to familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we show that specific deletion of the VPS35 gene in dopamine (DA) neurons resulted in PD-like deficits, including loss of DA neurons and accumulation of α-synuclein. Intriguingly, mitochondria became fragmented and dysfunctional in VPS35-deficient DA neurons, phenotypes that could be restored by expressing VPS35 wild-type, but not PD-linked mutant. Concomitantly, VPS35 deficiency or mutation increased mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase 1 (MUL1) and, thus, led to mitofusin 2 (MFN2) degradation and mitochondrial fragmentation. Suppression of MUL1 expression ameliorated MFN2 reduction and DA neuron loss but not α-synuclein accumulation. These results provide a cellular mechanism for VPS35 dysfunction in mitochondrial impairment and PD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
A high-fat diet (HFD) induces metabolic disease and low-grade metabolic inflammation in response to changes in the intestinal microbiota through as-yet-unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that a HFD-derived ileum microbiota is responsible for a decrease in Th17 cells of the lamina propria in axenic colonized mice. The HFD also changed the expression profiles of intestinal antigen-presenting cells and their ability to generate Th17 cells in vitro. Consistent with these data, the metabolic phenotype was mimicked in RORγt-deficient mice, which lack IL17 and IL22 function, and in the adoptive transfer experiment of T cells from RORγt-deficient mice into Rag1-deficient mice. We conclude that the microbiota of the ileum regulates Th17 cell homeostasis in the small intestine and determines the outcome of metabolic disease.

From an shRNA screen, we identified ClpP as a member of the mitochondrial proteome whose knockdown reduced the viability of K562 leukemic cells. Expression of this mitochondrial protease that has structural similarity to the cytoplasmic proteosome is increased in leukemic cells from approximately half of all patients with AML. Genetic or chemical inhibition of ClpP killed cells from both human AML cell lines and primary samples in which the cells showed elevated ClpP expression but did not affect their normal counterparts. Importantly, Clpp knockout mice were viable with normal hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, we found that ClpP interacts with mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins and metabolic enzymes, and knockdown of ClpP in leukemic cells inhibited oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a tumor suppression mechanism that blocks cell proliferation in response to oncogenic signaling. OIS is frequently accompanied by multinucleation; however, the origin of this is unknown. Here, we show that multinucleate OIS cells originate mostly from failed mitosis. Prior to senescence, mutant H-RasV12 activation in primary human fibroblasts compromised mitosis, concordant with abnormal expression of mitotic genes functionally linked to the observed mitotic spindle and chromatin defects. Simultaneously, H-RasV12 activation enhanced survival of cells with damaged mitoses, culminating in extended mitotic arrest and aberrant exit from mitosis via mitotic slippage. ERK-dependent transcriptional upregulation of Mcl1 was, at least in part, responsible for enhanced survival and slippage of cells with mitotic defects. Importantly, mitotic slippage and oncogene signaling cooperatively induced senescence and key senescence effectors p21 and p16. In summary, activated Ras coordinately triggers mitotic disruption and enhanced cell survival to promote formation of multinucleate senescent cells.

Abstract: Summary
Feeding behavior is exquisitely regulated by homeostatic and hedonic neural substrates that integrate energy demand as well as the reinforcing and rewarding aspects of food. Understanding the net contribution of homeostatic and reward-driven feeding has become critical because of the ubiquitous source of energy-dense foods and the consequent obesity epidemic. Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide-secreting neurons (AgRP neurons) provide the primary orexigenic drive of homeostatic feeding. Using models of neuronal inhibition or ablation, we demonstrate that the feeding response to a fast ghrelin or serotonin receptor agonist relies on AgRP neurons. However, when palatable food is provided, AgRP neurons are dispensable for an appropriate feeding response. In addition, AgRP-ablated mice present exacerbated stress-induced anorexia and palatable food intake—a hallmark of comfort feeding. These results suggest that, when AgRP neuron activity is impaired, neural circuits sensitive to emotion and stress are engaged and modulated by food palatability and dopamine signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The Otx2 homeodomain transcription factor is essential for gastrulation and early neural development. We generated Otx2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice to investigate its roles in telencephalon development after neurulation (approximately embryonic day 9.0). We conducted transcriptional profiling and in situ hybridization to identify genes de-regulated in Otx2 cKO ventral forebrain. In parallel, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to identify enhancer elements, the OTX2 binding motif, and de-regulated genes that are likely direct targets of OTX2 transcriptional regulation. We found that Otx2 was essential in septum specification, regulation of Fgf signaling in the rostral telencephalon, and medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) patterning, neurogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis. Within the MGE, Otx2 was required for ventral, but not dorsal, identity, thus controlling the production of specific MGE derivatives.

Abstract: Single ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2+ flux amplitude (iCa-RyR) decreases as intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ levels fall during a cardiac Ca2+ spark. Since iCa-RyR drives the inter-RyR Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) that underlies the spark, decreasing iCa-RyR may contribute to spark termination because RyRs that spontaneously close may stay closed. To test this possibility, we simultaneously measured local cytosolic and intra-SR ([Ca2+]cyto and [Ca2+]SR) during Ca2+ sparks in permeabilized rabbit ventricular myocytes. Local cytosolic or intra-SR Ca2+ dynamics were manipulated using Ca2+ buffers. Buffer manipulations applied in cells had no effect on individual RyR channels reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers. Presence of a fast cytosolic Ca2+ buffer (BAPTA) significantly suppressed Ca2+ spark activity and sparks terminated earlier at a higher than usual [Ca2+]SR level (∼80% vs. ∼62%). When cytosolic Ca2+ buffer power was reduced (i.e. cytosolic EGTA level decreased), sparks terminated later and at a lower than usual [Ca2+]SR level (∼45% vs. ∼62%). When intra-SR Ca2+ buffer power was increased, sparks also terminated later and at a lower than usual [Ca2+]SR (∼48% vs. ∼62%). These results suggest that cytosolic local control of inter-RyR CICR by iCa-RyR plays a substantial role during the spark termination process. Thus, alterations in local cytosolic Ca2+ handling dynamics in the dyadic cleft (Ca2+ buffering, extrusion, etc.) likely influence Ca2+ spark termination.

Abstract: Ca2+ liberation from the endoplasmic reticulum mediated by inositol trisphosphate receptor/channels (IP3Rs) in response to production of the second messenger IP3 regulates numerous signaling pathways. However, estimates of resting and physiologically relevant cytosolic concentrations of IP3 vary appreciably. Here we directly address this question, taking advantage of the large size of Xenopus oocytes to image Ca2+ liberation evoked by bolus intracellular injections of known concentrations of IP3. Our principal finding is that IP3 evokes both global and local Ca2+ signals in freshly isolated oocytes at concentrations as low as a few pM. A corollary is that basal, resting [IP3] must be even lower, given the absence of detectable Ca2+ signals before injection. The dose/response curve for IP3-activation of Ca2+ liberation suggests that freshly isolated oocytes express two distinct functional populations of IP3 receptors with EC50 values around 200pM and tens of nM, whereas the high-affinity receptors are not apparent in oocytes examined later than about 3 days after isolation from the ovary.

Abstract: Summary
The ATR replication checkpoint ensures that stalled forks remain stable when replisome movement is impeded. Using an improved iPOND protocol combined with SILAC mass spectrometry, we characterized human replisome dynamics in response to fork stalling. Our data provide a quantitative picture of the replisome and replication stress response proteomes in 32 experimental conditions. Importantly, rather than stabilize the replisome, the checkpoint prevents two distinct types of fork collapse. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of protein abundance on nascent DNA is sufficient to identify protein complexes and place newly identified replisome-associated proteins into functional pathways. As an example, we demonstrate that ZNF644 complexes with the G9a/GLP methyltransferase at replication forks and is needed to prevent replication-associated DNA damage. Our data reveal how the replication checkpoint preserves genome integrity, provide insights into the mechanism of action of ATR inhibitors, and will be a useful resource for replication, DNA repair, and chromatin investigators.

Codon Usage Influences the Local Rate of Translation Elongation to Regulate Co-translational Protein Folding,

Abstract: Summary
Codon usage bias is a universal feature of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes and has been proposed to regulate translation efficiency, accuracy, and protein folding based on the assumption that codon usage affects translation dynamics. The roles of codon usage in translation, however, are not clear and have been challenged by recent ribosome profiling studies. Here we used a Neurospora cell-free translation system to directly monitor the velocity of mRNA translation. We demonstrated that the preferred codons enhance the rate of translation elongation, whereas non-optimal codons slow elongation. Codon usage also controls ribosome traffic on mRNA. These conclusions were supported by ribosome profiling results in vitro and in vivo with template mRNAs designed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we demonstrate that codon usage regulates protein function by affecting co-translational protein folding. These results resolve a long-standing fundamental question and suggest the existence of a codon usage code for protein folding.

Abstract: Summary
Pervasive transcription of the human genome generates RNAs whose mode of formation and functions are largely uncharacterized. Here, we combine RNA-seq with detailed mechanistic studies to describe a transcript type derived from protein-coding genes. The resulting RNAs, which we call DoGs for downstream of gene containing transcripts, possess long non-coding regions (often >45 kb) and remain chromatin bound. DoGs are inducible by osmotic stress through an IP3 receptor signaling-dependent pathway, indicating active regulation. DoG levels are increased by decreased termination of the upstream transcript, a previously undescribed mechanism for rapid transcript induction. Relative depletion of polyA signals in DoG regions correlates with increased levels of DoGs after osmotic stress. We detect DoG transcription in several human cell lines and provide evidence for thousands of DoGs genome wide.

Abstract: Summary
In many tissues, the stem cell niche must coordinate behavior across multiple stem cell lineages. How this is achieved is largely unknown. We have identified delayed completion of cytokinesis in germline stem cells (GSCs) as a mechanism that regulates the production of stem cell daughters in the Drosophila testis. Through live imaging, we show that a secondary F-actin ring is formed through regulation of Cofilin activity to block cytokinesis progress after contractile ring disassembly. The duration of this block is controlled by Aurora B kinase. Additionally, we have identified a requirement for somatic cell encystment of the germline in promoting GSC abscission. We suggest that this non-autonomous role promotes coordination between stem cell lineages. These findings reveal the mechanisms by which cytokinesis is inhibited and reinitiated in GSCs and why such complex regulation exists within the stem cell niche.

MicroRNA-101 Suppresses Tumor Cell Proliferation by Acting as an Endogenous Proteasome Inhibitor via Targeting the Proteasome Assembly Factor POMP,

Abstract: Summary
Proteasome inhibition represents a promising strategy of cancer pharmacotherapy, but resistant tumor cells often emerge. Here we show that the microRNA-101 (miR-101) targets the proteasome maturation protein POMP, leading to impaired proteasome assembly and activity, and resulting in accumulation of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. miR-101-resistant POMP restores proper turnover of proteasome substrates and re-enables tumor cell growth. In ERα-positive breast cancers, miR-101 and POMP levels are inversely correlated, and high miR-101 expression or low POMP expression associates with prolonged survival. Mechanistically, miR-101 expression or POMP knockdown attenuated estrogen-driven transcription. Finally, suppressing POMP is sufficient to overcome tumor cell resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Taken together, proteasome activity can not only be manipulated through drugs, but is also subject to endogenous regulation through miR-101, which targets proteasome biogenesis to control overall protein turnover and tumor cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Phase-separated states of proteins underlie ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules and nuclear RNA-binding protein assemblies that may nucleate protein inclusions associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We report that the N-terminal low-complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS LC) is structurally disordered and forms a liquid-like phase-separated state resembling RNP granules. This state directly binds the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. Phase-separated FUS lacks static structures as probed by fluorescence microscopy, indicating they are distinct from both protein inclusions and hydrogels. We use solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to directly probe the dynamic architecture within FUS liquid phase-separated assemblies. Importantly, we find that FUS LC retains disordered secondary structure even in the liquid phase-separated state. Therefore, we propose that disordered protein granules, even those made of aggregation-prone prion-like domains, are dynamic and disordered molecular assemblies with transiently formed protein-protein contacts.

Abstract: Summary
After acute kidney injury (AKI), surviving cells within the nephron proliferate and repair. We identify Sox9 as an acute epithelial stress response in renal regeneration. Translational profiling after AKI revealed a rapid upregulation of Sox9 within proximal tubule (PT) cells, the nephron cell type most vulnerable to AKI. Descendants of Sox9+ cells generate the bulk of the nephron during development and regenerate functional PT epithelium after AKI-induced reactivation of Sox9 after renal injury. After restoration of renal function post-AKI, persistent Sox9 expression highlights regions of unresolved damage within injured nephrons. Inactivation of Sox9 in PT cells pre-injury indicates that Sox9 is required for the normal course of post-AKI recovery. These findings link Sox9 to cell intrinsic mechanisms regulating development and repair of the mammalian nephron.

Abstract: Objective
Following peripheral nerve injury, residing fibroblasts start to proliferate and accumulate at the injury site and may participate in neuroma tissue evolution. Retinoic acid has been shown to regulate many cellular processes and to display anti-proliferative and anti-fibrotic properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on rat peripheral nerve fibroblasts.
Materials and methods
Peripheral nerve fibroblasts and C166 cells were treated with increasing doses of ATRA (0.05nM to 1μM). The viability of cells was determined with 3-(4,5-dimethlthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In addition, the number of peripheral nerve fibroblasts was counted after two days of ATRA treatment and alternatively up to the end of next week. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining was implemented to morphologically visualize the possible mechanism of cell death. For apoptosis, caspase 3/7 activity was measured using Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit.
Results
MTT assay revealed that 0.05–1nM of ATRA reduces fibroblasts viabilities. Then, almost a plateau state was observed from 1nM to 1μM of ATRA exposure. Additionally, a deceleration in peripheral nerve fibroblasts growth was confirmed via cell counting. Quantification of acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining displayed highly increased number of early apoptotic cells following ATRA administration. Amplified activation of caspase 3/7 was in favor of apoptosis in ATRA treated peripheral nerve fibroblasts.
Conclusion
The data from the present study demonstrate that ATRA could interfere in peripheral nerve fibroblasts viabilities and induce apoptosis. Although more investigations are needed to be implemented, our in vitro results indicate that retinoic acid can probably help the regeneration of injured axon via reducing of fibroblasts growth.

Abstract: The histological and ultrastructural features of the testis of the invasive suckermouth sailfin catfish Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus rapidly proliferating in Marikina River, Philippines were characterized during the fish's 2010–2011 reproductive season. The germinal compartment of the testes was composed of anastomosing tubules with cysts undergoing synchronous development. Spermatogenic cells were along the length of the testes indicate it to be of the unrestricted spermatogonial type. The spermatozoon is classified as type 1 ect aquasperm devoid of acrosome, has rounded nucleus, and a long flagellum – characteristics necessary for external fertilization. Male P. disjunctivus was reproductively active during half of the year-long study with peak spawning during the most rainy months (June–August) and prolonged recrudescence during the dry months (February–May). Results from this study form a histological baseline to describe the gonad dynamics and reproduction of this invasive fish species as well as provide possible means of mechanical control to curb the population of the fish in this river.

Abstract: Summary
Defects in insulin secretion play a central role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, yet the mechanisms driving beta-cell dysfunction remain poorly understood, and therapies to preserve glucose-dependent insulin release are inadequate. We report a luminescent insulin secretion assay that enables large-scale investigations of beta-cell function, created by inserting Gaussia luciferase into the C-peptide portion of proinsulin. Beta-cell lines expressing this construct cosecrete luciferase and insulin in close correlation, under both standard conditions or when stressed by cytokines, fatty acids, or ER toxins. We adapted the reporter for high-throughput assays and performed a 1,600-compound pilot screen, which identified several classes of drugs inhibiting secretion, as well as glucose-potentiated secretagogues that were confirmed to have activity in primary human islets. Requiring 40-fold less time and expense than the traditional ELISA, this assay may accelerate the identification of pathways governing insulin secretion and compounds that safely augment beta-cell function in diabetes.

Abstract: C. elegans has two functional peroxidasins (PXN), PXN-1 and PXN-2. PXN-2 is essential to consolidate the extracellular matrix during development and is suggested to interact with PXN-1 antagonistically. pxn-1 is involved in neuronal development and possibly maintenance; therefore, we investigated the relationship between pxn-1 and pxn-2 in neuronal development and in aging. During neuronal development, defects caused by pxn-1 overexpression were suppressed by overexpression of both pxn-1 and pxn-2. In neuronal aging process, pxn-1 mutants showed less age-related neuronal defects, such as neuronal outgrowth, neuronal wavy processes, and enhanced short-term memory performance. In addition, pxn-2 overexpressing animals retained an intact neuronal morphology when compared with age-matched controls. Consistent with these results, overexpression of both pxn-1 and pxn-2 restored the severe neuronal defects present with pxn-1 overexpression. These results implied that there is a negative relationship between pxn-1 and pxn-2 via pxn-1 regulating pxn-2. Therefore, pxn-1 may function in neuronal development and age-related neuronal maintenance through pxn-2.

Abstract: Summary
The significance of ERG in human prostate cancer is unclear because mouse prostate is resistant to ERG-mediated transformation. We determined that ERG activates the transcriptional program regulated by YAP1 of the Hippo signaling pathway and found that prostate-specific activation of either ERG or YAP1 in mice induces similar transcriptional changes and results in age-related prostate tumors. ERG binds to chromatin regions occupied by TEAD/YAP1 and transactivates Hippo target genes. In addition, in human luminal-type prostate cancer cells, ERG binds to the promoter of YAP1 and is necessary for YAP1 expression. These results provide direct genetic evidence of a causal role for ERG in prostate cancer and reveal a connection between ERG and the Hippo signaling pathway.

Abstract: The balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis is crucial for tissue development and homeostasis. The present study investigated the contribution of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and apoptosis during ovarian remodeling after spawning in the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus. Breeding females were kept in controlled conditions and ovary samples were collected weekly for TUNEL assay, immunohistochemistry for PCNA and caspase-3 and morphometric analysis. During the follicular growth, PCNA labeled mainly the nuclei of oocytes and follicular cells in a high proportion of follicles especially in primary growth, while a low occurrence of apoptosis in follicular and theca cells was detected. At 0–3 days post-spawning, post-ovulatory follicles showed no proliferative activity, however the follicular cells exhibited high rates of apoptosis. At 7–10 days, PCNA labeled the thecal cells in a low proportion of post-ovulatory follicles, which showed follicular cells with lower rates of apoptosis. PCNA labeled mainly the theca in the advanced and late stages of atretic follicles, while the follicular cells exhibited a significant increase of apoptosis along follicular atresia. We concluded that PCNA and apoptosis work cooperatively to ensuring the success of follicle development and maintaining of tissue homeostasis during follicular growth. PCNA and apoptosis are also essential mechanisms in the follicular regression during post-spawning ovarian recovery in the Nile tilapia.

Abstract: Summary
Numerical chromosomal instability is a ubiquitous feature of human neoplasms. Due to experimental limitations, fundamental characteristics of karyotypic changes in cancer are poorly understood. Using an experimentally inspired stochastic model, based on the potency and chromosomal distribution of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, we show that cancer cells have evolved to exist within a narrow range of chromosome missegregation rates that optimizes phenotypic heterogeneity and clonal survival. Departure from this range reduces clonal fitness and limits subclonal diversity. Mapping of the aneuploid fitness landscape reveals a highly favorable, commonly observed, near-triploid state onto which evolving diploid- and tetraploid-derived populations spontaneously converge, albeit at a much lower fitness cost for the latter. Finally, by analyzing 1,368 chromosomal translocation events in five human cancers, we find that karyotypic evolution also shapes chromosomal translocation patterns by selecting for more oncogenic derivative chromosomes. Thus, chromosomal instability can generate the heterogeneity required for Darwinian tumor evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic islet failure, involving loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from islet β cells, heralds the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To search for mediators of GSIS, we performed metabolomics profiling of the insulinoma cell line 832/13 and uncovered significant glucose-induced changes in purine pathway intermediates, including a decrease in inosine monophosphate (IMP) and an increase in adenylosuccinate (S-AMP), suggesting a regulatory role for the enzyme that links the two metabolites, adenylosuccinate synthase (ADSS). Inhibition of ADSS or a more proximal enzyme in the S-AMP biosynthesis pathway, adenylosuccinate lyase, lowers S-AMP levels and impairs GSIS. Addition of S-AMP to the interior of patch-clamped human β cells amplifies exocytosis, an effect dependent upon expression of sentrin/SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1). S-AMP also overcomes the defect in glucose-induced exocytosis in β cells from a human donor with T2D. S-AMP is, thus, an insulin secretagogue capable of reversing β cell dysfunction in T2D.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-mediated gene silencing in human cells requires the accurate generation of ∼22 nt microRNAs (miRNAs) from double-stranded RNA substrates by the endonuclease Dicer. Although the phylogenetically conserved RNA-binding proteins TRBP and PACT are known to contribute to this process, their mode of Dicer binding and their genome-wide effects on miRNA processing have not been determined. We solved the crystal structure of the human Dicer-TRBP interface, revealing the structural basis of the interaction. Interface residues conserved between TRBP and PACT show that the proteins bind to Dicer in a similar manner and by mutual exclusion. Based on the structure, a catalytically active Dicer that cannot bind TRBP or PACT was designed and introduced into Dicer-deficient mammalian cells, revealing selective defects in guide strand selection. These results demonstrate the role of Dicer-associated RNA binding proteins in maintenance of gene silencing fidelity.

Abstract: Summary
Mec1-Ddc2 (ATR-ATRIP) controls the DNA damage checkpoint and shows differential cell-cycle regulation in yeast. To find regulators of Mec1-Ddc2, we exploited a mec1 mutant that retains catalytic activity in G2 and recruitment to stalled replication forks, but which is compromised for the intra-S phase checkpoint. Two screens, one for spontaneous survivors and an E-MAP screen for synthetic growth effects, identified loss of PP4 phosphatase, pph3Δ and psy2Δ, as the strongest suppressors of mec1-100 lethality on HU. Restored Rad53 phosphorylation accounts for part, but not all, of the pph3Δ-mediated survival. Phosphoproteomic analysis confirmed that 94% of the mec1-100-compromised targets on HU are PP4 regulated, including a phosphoacceptor site within Mec1 itself, mutation of which confers damage sensitivity. Physical interaction between Pph3 and Mec1, mediated by cofactors Psy2 and Ddc2, is shown biochemically and through FRET in subnuclear repair foci. This establishes a physical and functional Mec1-PP4 unit for regulating the checkpoint response.

Abstract: Summary
Adiponectin is an abundant adipokine with pleiotropic protective effects against a cluster of obesity-related cardiometabolic disorders. However, its role in adaptive thermogenesis has scarcely been explored. Here we showed that chronic cold exposure led to a markedly elevated production of adiponectin in adipocytes of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT), which in turn bound to M2 macrophages in the stromal vascular fraction. Chronic cold exposure-induced accumulation of M2 macrophages, activation of beige cells, and thermogenic program were markedly impaired in scWAT of adiponectin knockout (ADN KO) mice, whereas these impairments were reversed by replenishment with adiponectin. Mechanistically, adiponectin was recruited to the cell surface of M2 macrophages via its binding partner T-cadherin and promoted the cell proliferation by activation of Akt, consequently leading to beige cell activation. These findings uncover adiponectin as a key efferent signal for cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis by mediating the crosstalk between adipocytes and M2 macrophages in scWAT.

Abstract: Summary
As the list of putative driver mutations in glioma grows, we are just beginning to elucidate the effects of dysregulated developmental signaling pathways on the transformation of neural cells. We have employed a postnatal, mosaic, autochthonous glioma model that captures the first hours and days of gliomagenesis in more resolution than conventional genetically engineered mouse models of cancer. We provide evidence that disruption of the Nf1-Ras pathway in the ventricular zone at multiple signaling nodes uniformly results in rapid neural stem cell depletion, progenitor hyperproliferation, and gliogenic lineage restriction. Abolishing Ets subfamily activity, which is upregulated downstream of Ras, rescues these phenotypes and blocks glioma initiation. Thus, the Nf1-Ras-Ets axis might be one of the select molecular pathways that are perturbed for initiation and maintenance in glioma.

Abstract: Summary
Long believed to be a byproduct of malignant transformation, reprogramming of cellular metabolism is now recognized as a driving force in tumorigenesis. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), frequent activation of HIF signaling induces a metabolic switch that promotes tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrate that PGC-1α, a central regulator of energy metabolism, is suppressed in VHL-deficient ccRCC by a HIF/Dec1-dependent mechanism. In VHL wild-type cells, PGC-1α suppression leads to decreased expression of the mitochondrial transcription factor Tfam and impaired mitochondrial respiration. Conversely, PGC-1α expression in VHL-deficient cells restores mitochondrial function and induces oxidative stress. ccRCC cells expressing PGC-1α exhibit impaired tumor growth and enhanced sensitivity to cytotoxic therapies. In patients, low levels of PGC-1α expression are associated with poor outcome. These studies demonstrate that suppression of PGC-1α recapitulates key metabolic phenotypes of ccRCC and highlight the potential of targeting PGC-1α expression as a therapeutic modality for the treatment of ccRCC.

Abstract: Summary
Three transcription factors (TFs), OxyR, SoxR, and SoxS, play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of the defense system for oxidative stress in bacteria. However, their full genome-wide regulatory potential is unknown. Here, we perform a genome-scale reconstruction of the OxyR, SoxR, and SoxS regulons in Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. Integrative data analysis reveals that a total of 68 genes in 51 transcription units (TUs) belong to these regulons. Among them, 48 genes showed more than 2-fold changes in expression level under single-TF-knockout conditions. This reconstruction expands the genome-wide roles of these factors to include direct activation of genes related to amino acid biosynthesis (methionine and aromatic amino acids), cell wall synthesis (lipid A biosynthesis and peptidoglycan growth), and divalent metal ion transport (Mn2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+). Investigating the co-regulation of these genes with other stress-response TFs reveals that they are independently regulated by stress-specific TFs.

Abstract: Summary
Human Timeless helps stabilize replication forks during normal DNA replication and plays a critical role in activation of the S phase checkpoint and proper establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. However, it remains elusive whether Timeless is involved in the repair of damaged DNA. Here, we identify that Timeless physically interacts with PARP-1 independent of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. We present high-resolution crystal structures of Timeless PAB (PARP-1-binding domain) in free form and in complex with PARP-1 catalytic domain. Interestingly, Timeless PAB domain specifically recognizes PARP-1, but not PARP-2 or PARP-3. Timeless-PARP-1 interaction does not interfere with PARP-1 enzymatic activity. We demonstrate that rapid and transient accumulation of Timeless at laser-induced DNA damage sites requires PARP-1, but not poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and that Timeless is co-trapped with PARP-1 at DNA lesions upon PARP inhibition. Furthermore, we show that Timeless and PARP-1 interaction is required for efficient homologous recombination repair.

Abstract: In this paper we describe a new structure present in highly proliferative cells and absent in cells with normal growth potential. We used cultured bovine venular endothelial cells (CVEC) as examples of high proliferation, and dermal fibroblasts of a primary culture as examples of normal proliferation. The structure, consisting of tubules radiating from the nuclear region to the tips of cell protrusions, was revealed by its strong positivity to the fucose-binding lectin from Lotus (LTL) that prefers glycans with alpha-1,2-linked fucose. Another fucose-binding lectin that prefers glycans with alpha-1,6-linked fucose was instead found to localize glycans exclusively in Golgi complexes. LTL binding sites were also found at the surface of CVEC in a restricted region close to the nucleus. The role of alpha-1,2-linked fucose in forming or maintaining the tubules was confirmed by the fact that down-regulation of the fucosyltransferases FUT1 and FUT2 resulted in disappearance of the tubular structure. LTL also proved able to penetrate the cells through the tubular structures up to the nuclear region and to inhibit proliferation. Endostatin was also found to massively penetrate the cells in the tubular structures in control cells but not in FUT1/2 depleted cells. In cells of a first passage primary culture of dermal fibroblasts the tubular LTL-positive structure was absent as well as the LTL-positive sites at the external surface, and both fucose-binding lectins were found to exclusively localize glycans in Golgi complexes. Tubules were again found progressively in fibroblasts derived from repeated passages, where faster growing cells predominate. Disappearance of LTL-positivity in Golgi complexes paralleled appearance of LTL-positive tubules. The role of Golgi complexes in forming the tubules is discussed.

Abstract: In the present experiments in HEL cells, we have investigated the requirement for a hyperpolarised resting membrane potential for the initial activation of the Ca2+ activated K+ channel, KCa3.1, following activation of the Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ (CRAC) entry pathway. In intact cells, fluorimetric measurements of [Ca2+]i following thapsigargin-mediated activation of CRAC entry revealed a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i. Block of KCa3.1 by application of charybdotoxin resulted in a 50% reduction in the steady-state [Ca2+]i, consistent with the well established role for KCa3.1-mediated hyperpolarisation in augmenting CRAC entry. Interestingly, subsequent depolarisation to 0mV by application of gramicidin resulted in a fall in steady-state Ca2+ levels to values theoretically below that required for activation of KCa3.1. Whole cell patch clamp experiments confirmed the lack of KCa3.1 activation at 0mV following activation of the CRAC entry pathway, indicating an absolute requirement for a hyperpolarised resting membrane potential for the initial activation of KCa3.1 leading to hyperpolarisation and augmented Ca2+ entry. Current clamp experiments confirmed the requirement for a hyperpolarised resting membrane potential in KCa3.1 activation by CRAC entry. Given the critical role played by KCa3.1 and membrane potential in general in the control of CRAC-mediated [Ca2+]i changes, we investigated the hypothesis that inhibition of the CRAC-mediated changes in [Ca2+]i observed following 2-APB addition may in part arise from direct inhibition of KCa3.1 by 2-APB. Under whole cell patch clamp, 2-APB, at concentrations typically used to block the CRAC channel, potently inhibited KCa3.1 in a reversible manner (half maximal inhibition 14.2μM). This block was accompanied by a marked shift in the reversal potential to depolarised values approaching that set by endogenous membrane conductances. At the single channel level, 2-APB applied to the cytosolic face resulted in a significant reduction in open channel probability and a fall in the mean open time of the residual channel activity. Our data highlight the absolute requirement for a hyperpolarising resting membrane conductance for the initial activation of KCa3.1 by CRAC entry. Additionally, our results document direct inhibition of KCa3.1 by 2-APB, thus highlighting the need for caution when ascribing the site of inhibition of 2-APB exclusively to the CRAC entry pathway in experiments where membrane potential is not controlled.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are CNS resident macrophages, and they play important roles in neural development and function. Recent studies have suggested that murine microglia arise from a single source, the yolk sac (YS), yet these studies lack spatial resolution to define the bona fide source(s) for microglia. Here, using light-induced high temporal-spatial resolution fate mapping, we challenge this single-source view by showing that microglia in zebrafish arise from multiple sources. The embryonic/larval microglia originate from the rostral blood island (RBI) region, the equivalent of mouse YS for myelopoiesis, whereas the adult microglia arise from the ventral wall of dorsal aorta (VDA) region, a tissue also producing definitive hematopoiesis in mouse. We further show that the VDA-region-derived microglia are Runx1 dependent, but cMyb independent, and developmentally regulated differently from the RBI region-derived microglia. Our study establishes a new paradigm for investigating the development and function of distinct microglia populations.

Abstract: Quercetin can suppress osteosarcoma cell growth and metastasis. However, other effects of quercetin on osteosarcoma remain largely unknown. This research aims to evaluate the effects of quercetin in combination with cisplatin as treatment for osteosarcoma and investigate its regulatory mechanism. Cell viability and apoptosis in 143B cell line were determined after treatment with quercetin and/or cisplatin. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to determine the RNA or protein expression levels. Moreover, transwell assay was used to evaluate metastasis. Furthermore, rescue experiments were performed to investigate the potential regulatory mechanism of the treatment. Results showed that quercetin with concentration that was equal to or greater than 10 μM inhibited 143B proliferation, while 5 μM quercetin enhanced the cisplatin sensitivity of 143B cells. Expression of miR-217 was upregulated after quercetin and/or cisplatin treatment, while its target KRAS was downregulated both at mRNA and protein levels. MiR-217 knockdown led to the loss of enhanced cisplatin sensitivity while miR-217 overexpression showed the opposite effects, indicating that quercetin regulated cisplatin sensitivity by modulating the miR-217-KRAS axis. In conclusion, 5 μM quercetin enhanced the cisplatin sensitivity by modulating the miR-217-KRAS axis. This finding suggests that quercetin may be administered with cisplatin to improve the treatment for osteosarcoma.

Abstract: Carbohydrate antigens expressed on pig cells are considered to be major barriers in pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Even after α1,3-galactosyltransferase gene knock-out (GalT-KO) pigs are generated, potential non-Gal antigens are still existed. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no extensive study analyzing N-glycans expressed on the GalT-KO pig tissues or cells. Here, we identified and quantified totally 47 N-glycans from wild-type (WT) and GalT-KO pig fibroblasts using mass spectrometry. First, our results confirmed the absence of galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (α-Gal) residue in the GalT-KO pig cells. Interestingly, we showed that the level of overall fucosylated N-glycans from GalT-KO pig fibroblasts is much higher than from WT pig fibroblasts. Moreover, the relative quantity of the N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) antigen is slightly higher in the GalT-KO pigs. Thus, this study will contribute to a better understanding of cellular glycan alterations on GalT-KO pigs for successful xenotransplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic and clinical association studies have identified disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) as a candidate risk gene for major mental illness. DISC1 is interrupted by a balanced chr(1;11) translocation in a Scottish family in which the translocation predisposes to psychiatric disorders. We investigate the consequences of DISC1 interruption in human neural cells using TALENs or CRISPR-Cas9 to target the DISC1 locus. We show that disruption of DISC1 near the site of the translocation results in decreased DISC1 protein levels because of nonsense-mediated decay of long splice variants. This results in an increased level of canonical Wnt signaling in neural progenitor cells and altered expression of fate markers such as Foxg1 and Tbr2. These gene expression changes are rescued by antagonizing Wnt signaling in a critical developmental window, supporting the hypothesis that DISC1-dependent suppression of basal Wnt signaling influences the distribution of cell types generated during cortical development.

Abstract: Monocytes are the major inflammatory cells that infiltrate most solid tumors in humans. The interaction of tumor cells with infiltrating monocytes and their adhesion to these monocytes play a significant role in altering the tumor to become more aggressive. Recently, exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was suggested to promote cancer cell adhesion to monocytes; however, little is known about the details of the signaling mechanism involved in this process. In this study, we found that LPS up-regulates ICAM-1 expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which facilitates their adhesion to THP-1 monocytes. In addition, we analyzed the signaling mechanism underlying the up-regulation of ICAM-1 and found that the siRNA-mediated depletion of BLT2 markedly suppressed the LPS-induced expression of ICAM-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells and the subsequent adhesion of these cells to THP-1 monocytes. Moreover, we demonstrated that myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) lies downstream of LPS/TLR4 and upstream of BLT2 and that this ‘MyD88-BLT2’ cascade mediates ERK activation and subsequent ICAM-1 expression, which is critical for the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to THP-1 monocytes. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that LPS up-regulates ICAM-1 expression in breast cancer cells via a MyD88-BLT2-ERK-linked signaling cascade, leading to the increased adhesion of breast cancer cells to monocytes.

Abstract: Summary
The killing of antigen-bearing cells by clonal populations of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is thought to be a rapid phenomenon executed uniformly by individual CTLs. We combined bulk and single-CTL killing assays over a prolonged time period to provide the killing statistics of clonal human CTLs against an excess of target cells. Our data reveal efficiency in sustained killing at the population level, which relied on a highly heterogeneous multiple killing performance at the individual level. Although intraclonal functional heterogeneity was a stable trait in clonal populations, it was reset in the progeny of individual CTLs. In-depth mathematical analysis of individual CTL killing data revealed a substantial proportion of high-rate killer CTLs with burst killing activity. Importantly, such activity was delayed and required activation with strong antigenic stimulation. Our study implies that functional heterogeneity allows CTL populations to calibrate prolonged cytotoxic activity to the size of target cell populations.

Abstract: Summary
We undertook a comprehensive clinical and biological investigation of serial medulloblastoma biopsies obtained at diagnosis and relapse. Combined MYC family amplifications and P53 pathway defects commonly emerged at relapse, and all patients in this group died of rapidly progressive disease postrelapse. To study this interaction, we investigated a transgenic model of MYCN-driven medulloblastoma and found spontaneous development of Trp53 inactivating mutations. Abrogation of p53 function in this model produced aggressive tumors that mimicked characteristics of relapsed human tumors with combined P53-MYC dysfunction. Restoration of p53 activity and genetic and therapeutic suppression of MYCN all reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival. Our findings identify P53-MYC interactions at medulloblastoma relapse as biomarkers of clinically aggressive disease that may be targeted therapeutically.

Abstract: Summary
How loss-of-function of GATA3 contributes to the development of breast cancer is poorly understood. Here, we report that GATA3 nucleates a transcription repression program composed of G9A and MTA3-, but not MTA1- or MTA2-, constituted NuRD complex. Genome-wide analysis of the GATA3/G9A/NuRD(MTA3) targets identified a cohort of genes including ZEB2 that are critically involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion. We demonstrate that the GATA3/G9A/NuRD(MTA3) complex inhibits the invasive potential of breast cancer cells in vitro and suppresses breast cancer metastasis in vivo. Strikingly, the expression of GATA3, G9A, and MTA3 is concurrently downregulated during breast cancer progression, leading to an elevated expression of ZEB2, which, in turn, represses the expression of G9A and MTA3 through the recruitment of G9A/NuRD(MTA1).

Abstract: Summary
We show that central components of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, the tumor suppressor proteins FANCI and FANCD2 (the ID complex), are SUMOylated in response to replication fork stalling. The ID complex is SUMOylated in a manner that depends on the ATR kinase, the FA ubiquitin ligase core complex, and the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1/PIAS4 and is antagonized by the SUMO protease SENP6. SUMOylation of the ID complex drives substrate selectivity by triggering its polyubiquitylation by the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF4 to promote its removal from sites of DNA damage via the DVC1-p97 ubiquitin segregase complex. Deregulation of ID complex SUMOylation compromises cell survival following replication stress. Our results uncover a regulatory role for SUMOylation in the FA pathway, and we propose that ubiquitin-SUMO signaling circuitry is a mechanism that contributes to the balance of activated ID complex dosage at sites of DNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide analysis of thymic lymphomas from Tp53−/− mice with wild-type or C-terminally truncated Rag2 revealed numerous off-target, RAG-mediated DNA rearrangements. A significantly higher fraction of these errors mutated known and suspected oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes than did sporadic rearrangements (p < 0.0001). This tractable mouse model recapitulates recent findings in human pre-B ALL and allows comparison of wild-type and mutant RAG2. Recurrent, RAG-mediated deletions affected Notch1, Pten, Ikzf1, Jak1, Phlda1, Trat1, and Agpat9. Rag2 truncation substantially increased the frequency of off-target V(D)J recombination. The data suggest that interactions between Rag2 and a specific chromatin modification, H3K4me3, support V(D)J recombination fidelity. Oncogenic effects of off-target rearrangements created by this highly regulated recombinase may need to be considered in design of site-specific nucleases engineered for genome modification.

Abstract: Summary
The sympathetic nervous system controls smooth muscle tone and heart rate in the cardiovascular system. Postganglionic sympathetic neurons (SNs) develop in close proximity to the dorsal aorta (DA) and innervate visceral smooth muscle targets. Here, we use the zebrafish embryo to ask whether the DA is required for SN development. We show that noradrenergic (NA) differentiation of SN precursors temporally coincides with vascular mural cell (VMC) recruitment to the DA and vascular maturation. Blocking vascular maturation inhibits VMC recruitment and blocks NA differentiation of SN precursors. Inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling prevents VMC differentiation and also blocks NA differentiation of SN precursors. NA differentiation is normal in cloche mutants that are devoid of endothelial cells but have VMCs. Thus, PDGFR-mediated mural cell recruitment mediates neurovascular interactions between the aorta and sympathetic precursors and promotes their noradrenergic differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) promotes insulin sensitivity but causes bone loss. It elevates bone resorption by an undefined non-osteoclast-autonomous mechanism. We have detected a pro-osteoclastogenic activity in the hepatic secretome that is increased by FGF21 and largely attributed to insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1). Ex vivo osteoclast differentiation and in vivo bone resorption are both enhanced by recombinant IGFBP1 but suppressed by an IGFBP1-blocking antibody. Anti-IGFBP1 treatment attenuates ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis and abolishes FGF21-induced bone loss while maintaining its insulin-sensitizing metabolic benefit. Mechanistically, IGFBP1 functions via its RGD domain to bind to its receptor integrin β1 on osteoclast precursors, thereby potentiating RANKL-stimulated Erk-phosphorylation and NFATc1 activation. Consequently, osteoclastic integrin β1 deletion confers resistance to the resorption-enhancing effects of both IGFBP1 and FGF21. Therefore, the hepatokine IGFBP1 is a critical liver-bone hormonal relay that promotes osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption as well as an essential mediator of FGF21-induced bone loss.

Abstract: Summary
LY3009120 is a pan-RAF and RAF dimer inhibitor that inhibits all RAF isoforms and occupies both protomers in RAF dimers. Biochemical and cellular analyses revealed that LY3009120 inhibits ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF isoforms with similar affinity, while vemurafenib or dabrafenib have little or modest CRAF activity compared to their BRAF activities. LY3009120 induces BRAF-CRAF dimerization but inhibits the phosphorylation of downstream MEK and ERK, suggesting that it effectively inhibits the kinase activity of BRAF-CRAF heterodimers. Further analyses demonstrated that LY3009120 also inhibits various forms of RAF dimers including BRAF or CRAF homodimers. Due to these unique properties, LY3009120 demonstrates minimal paradoxical activation, inhibits MEK1/2 phosphorylation, and exhibits anti-tumor activities across multiple models carrying KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutation.

Abstract: Summary
How tissues acquire their characteristic shape is a fundamental unresolved question in biology. While genes have been characterized that control local mechanical forces to elongate epithelial tissues, genes controlling global forces in epithelia have yet to be identified. Here, we describe a genetic pathway that shapes appendages in Drosophila by defining the pattern of global tensile forces in the tissue. In the appendages, shape arises from tension generated by cell constriction and localized anchorage of the epithelium to the cuticle via the apical extracellular-matrix protein Dumpy (Dp). Altering Dp expression in the developing wing results in predictable changes in wing shape that can be simulated by a computational model that incorporates only tissue contraction and localized anchorage. Three other wing shape genes, narrow, tapered, and lanceolate, encode components of a pathway that modulates Dp distribution in the wing to refine the global force pattern and thus wing shape.

Abstract: Summary
Non-coding RNAs can modulate histone modifications that, at the same time, affect transcript expression levels. Here, we dissect such a network in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). It regulates the activity of the reverse transcriptase telomerase, which synthesizes telomeric repeats at the chromosome ends. We find that histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation set by Aurora kinase B (AURKB) in ESCs during the S phase of the cell cycle at centromeric and (sub)telomeric loci promotes the expression of non-coding minor satellite RNA (cenRNA). Inhibition of AURKB induces silencing of cenRNA transcription and establishment of a repressive chromatin state with histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation and heterochromatin protein 1 accumulation. This process results in a continuous shortening of telomeres. We further show that AURKB interacts with both telomerase and cenRNA and activates telomerase in trans. Thus, in mouse ESCs, telomere maintenance is regulated via expression of cenRNA in a cell-cycle-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
The pacemaker properties of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian clock are shaped by mechanisms that influence the expression and behavior of clock proteins. Here, we reveal that G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) modulates the period, amplitude, and entrainment characteristics of the SCN. Grk2-deficient mice show phase-dependent alterations in light-induced entrainment, slower recovery from jetlag, and longer behavioral rhythms. Grk2 ablation perturbs intrinsic rhythmic properties of the SCN, increasing amplitude and decreasing period. At the cellular level, GRK2 suppresses the transcription of the mPeriod1 gene and the trafficking of PERIOD1 and PERIOD2 proteins to the nucleus. Moreover, GRK2 can physically interact with PERIOD1/2 and promote PERIOD2 phosphorylation at Ser545, effects that may underlie its ability to regulate PERIOD1/2 trafficking. Together, our findings identify GRK2 as an important modulator of circadian clock speed, amplitude, and entrainment by controlling PERIOD at the transcriptional and post-translational levels.

Abstract: Summary
Since the presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was confirmed in adult humans, BAT has become a therapeutic target for obesity and insulin resistance. We examined whether human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) can adopt a BAT-like phenotype using a clinical model of prolonged and severe adrenergic stress. sWAT samples were collected from severely burned and healthy individuals. A subset of burn victims were prospectively followed during their acute hospitalization. Browning of sWAT was determined by the presence of multilocular adipocytes, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), and increased mitochondrial density and respiratory capacity. Multilocular UCP1-positive adipocytes were found in sWAT samples from burn patients. UCP1 mRNA, mitochondrial density, and leak respiratory capacity in sWAT increased after burn trauma. Our data demonstrate that human sWAT can transform from an energy-storing to an energy-dissipating tissue, which opens new research avenues in our quest to prevent and treat obesity and its metabolic complications.

Abstract: Summary
In Drosophila and mammals, the canonical Hippo kinase cascade is mediated by Hpo/Mst acting through the intermediary kinase Wts/Lats to phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator Yki/YAP/TAZ. Despite recent reports linking Yki/YAP/TAZ activity to the actin cytoskeleton, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and/or controversial. Using Drosophila imaginal discs as an in vivo model, we show that Wts, but not Hpo, is genetically indispensable for cytoskeleton-mediated subcellular localization of Yki. Through a systematic screen, we identify the Ste-20 kinase Happyhour (Hppy) and its mammalian counterpart MAP4K1/2/3/5 as an alternative kinase that phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of Wts/Lats in a similar manner as Hpo/Mst. Consistent with their redundant function as activating kinases of Wts/Lats, combined loss of Hpo/Mst and Hppy/MAP4K abolishes cytoskeleton-mediated regulation of Yki/YAP subcellular localization, as well as YAP cytoplasmic translocation induced by contact inhibition. These Hpo/Mst-like kinases provide an expanded view of the Hippo kinase cascade in development and physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Temperature profoundly affects aging in both poikilotherms and homeotherms. A general belief is that lower temperatures extend lifespan, whereas higher temperatures shorten it. Although this “temperature law” is widely accepted, it has not been extensively tested. Here, we systematically evaluated the role of temperature in lifespan regulation in C. elegans. We found that, although exposure to low temperatures at the adult stage prolongs lifespan, low-temperature treatment at the larval stage surprisingly reduces lifespan. Interestingly, this differential effect of temperature on longevity in larvae and adults is mediated by the same thermosensitive TRP channel TRPA-1 that signals to the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. DAF-16/FOXO and TRPA-1 act in larva to shorten lifespan but extend lifespan in adulthood. DAF-16/FOXO differentially regulates gene expression in larva and adult in a temperature-dependent manner. Our results uncover complexity underlying temperature modulation of longevity, demonstrating that temperature differentially regulates lifespan at different stages of life.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) are lipid storage organelles that grow or shrink, depending on the availability of metabolic energy. Proteins recruited to LDs mediate many metabolic functions, including phosphatidylcholine and triglyceride synthesis. How the LD protein composition is tuned to the supply and demand for lipids remains unclear. We show that LDs, in contrast to other organelles, have limited capacity for protein binding. Consequently, macromolecular crowding plays a major role in determining LD protein composition. During lipolysis, when LDs and their surfaces shrink, some, but not all, proteins become displaced. In vitro studies show that macromolecular crowding, rather than changes in monolayer lipid composition, causes proteins to fall off the LD surface. As predicted by a crowding model, proteins compete for binding to the surfaces of LDs. Moreover, the LD binding affinity determines protein localization during lipolysis. Our findings identify protein crowding as an important principle in determining LD protein composition.

Abstract: Summary
There has been evidence that mitochondrial fragmentation is required for apoptosis, but the molecular links between the machinery regulating dynamics and cell death have been controversial. Indeed, activated BAX and BAK can form functional channels in liposomes, bringing into question the contribution of mitochondrial dynamics in apoptosis. We now demonstrate that the activation of apoptosis triggers MAPL/MUL1-dependent SUMOylation of the fission GTPase Drp1, a process requisite for cytochrome c release. SUMOylated Drp1 functionally stabilizes ER/mitochondrial contact sites that act as hotspots for mitochondrial constriction, calcium flux, cristae remodeling, and cytochrome c release. The loss of MAPL does not alter the activation and assembly of BAX/BAK oligomers, indicating that MAPL is activated downstream of BAX/BAK. This work demonstrates how interorganellar contacts are dynamically regulated through active SUMOylation during apoptosis, creating a stabilized platform that signals cytochrome c release.

Abstract: Summary
mTORC1 plays a key role in autophagy as a negative regulator. The currently known targets of mTORC1 in the autophagy pathway mainly function at early stages of autophagosome formation. Here, we identify that mTORC1 inhibits later stages of autophagy by phosphorylating UVRAG. Under nutrient-enriched conditions, mTORC1 binds and phosphorylates UVRAG. The phosphorylation positively regulates the association of UVRAG with RUBICON, thereby enhancing the antagonizing effect of RUBICON on UVRAG-mediated autophagosome maturation. Upon dephosphorylation, UVRAG is released from RUBICON to interact with the HOPS complex, a component for the late endosome and lysosome fusion machinery, and enhances autophagosome and endosome maturation. Consequently, the dephosphorylation of UVRAG facilitates the lysosomal degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), reduces EGFR signaling, and suppresses cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. These results demonstrate that mTORC1 engages in late stages of autophagy and endosome maturation, defining a broader range of mTORC1 functions in the membrane-associated processes.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomes of a broad range of species, from bacteria to mammals, are structured by large topological domains whose precise functional roles and regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we combine super-resolution microscopies and chromosome-capture technologies to unravel the higher-order organization of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome and its dynamic rearrangements during the cell cycle. We decipher the fine 3D architecture of the origin domain, revealing folding motifs regulated by condensin-like complexes. This organization, along with global folding throughout the genome, is present before replication, disrupted by active DNA replication, and re-established thereafter. Single-cell analysis revealed a strict correspondence between sub-cellular localization of origin domains and their condensation state. Our results suggest that the precise 3D folding pattern of the origin domain plays a role in the regulation of replication initiation, chromosome organization, and DNA segregation.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic cells possess numerous dynamic membrane-less organelles, RNP granules, enriched in RNA and RNA-binding proteins containing disordered regions. We demonstrate that the disordered regions of key RNP granule components and the full-length granule protein hnRNPA1 can phase separate in vitro, producing dynamic liquid droplets. Phase separation is promoted by low salt concentrations or RNA. Over time, the droplets mature to more stable states, as assessed by slowed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and resistance to salt. Maturation often coincides with formation of fibrous structures. Different disordered domains can co-assemble into phase-separated droplets. These biophysical properties demonstrate a plausible mechanism by which interactions between disordered regions, coupled with RNA binding, could contribute to RNP granule assembly in vivo through promoting phase separation. Progression from dynamic liquids to stable fibers may be regulated to produce cellular structures with diverse physiochemical properties and functions. Misregulation could contribute to diseases involving aberrant RNA granules.

Abstract: Summary
Contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL) is the process through which cells move away from each other after cell-cell contact, and it contributes to malignant invasion and developmental migration. Various cell types exhibit CIL, whereas others remain in contact after collision and may form stable junctions. To investigate what determines this differential behavior, we study neural crest cells, a migratory stem cell population whose invasiveness has been likened to cancer metastasis. By comparing pre-migratory and migratory neural crest cells, we show that the switch from E- to N-cadherin during EMT is essential for acquisition of CIL behavior. Loss of E-cadherin leads to repolarization of protrusions, via p120 and Rac1, resulting in a redistribution of forces from intercellular tension to cell-matrix adhesions, which break down the cadherin junction. These data provide insight into the balance of physical forces that contributes to CIL in cells in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis has emerged as a new form of regulated necrosis that is implicated in various human diseases. However, the mechanisms of ferroptosis are not well defined. This study reports the discovery of multiple molecular components of ferroptosis and its intimate interplay with cellular metabolism and redox machinery. Nutrient starvation often leads to sporadic apoptosis. Strikingly, we found that upon deprivation of amino acids, a more rapid and potent necrosis process can be induced in a serum-dependent manner, which was subsequently determined to be ferroptosis. Two serum factors, the iron-carrier protein transferrin and amino acid glutamine, were identified as the inducers of ferroptosis. We further found that the cell surface transferrin receptor and the glutamine-fueled intracellular metabolic pathway, glutaminolysis, played crucial roles in the death process. Inhibition of glutaminolysis, the essential component of ferroptosis, can reduce heart injury triggered by ischemia/reperfusion, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for treating related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
West Nile virus (WNV) causes an acute neurological infection attended by massive neuronal cell death. However, the mechanism(s) behind the virus-induced cell death is poorly understood. Using a library containing 77,406 sgRNAs targeting 20,121 genes, we performed a genome-wide screen followed by a second screen with a sub-library. Among the genes identified, seven genes, EMC2, EMC3, SEL1L, DERL2, UBE2G2, UBE2J1, and HRD1, stood out as having the strongest phenotype, whose knockout conferred strong protection against WNV-induced cell death with two different WNV strains and in three cell lines. Interestingly, knockout of these genes did not block WNV replication. Thus, these appear to be essential genes that link WNV replication to downstream cell death pathway(s). In addition, the fact that all of these genes belong to the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway suggests that this might be the primary driver of WNV-induced cell death.

Abstract: Summary
PUF proteins are post-transcriptional regulators that bind to the 3′ UTRs of mRNA transcripts. Herein, we show how a yeast PUF protein, Puf3p, responds to glucose availability to switch the fate of its bound transcripts that encode proteins required for mitochondrial biogenesis. Upon glucose depletion, Puf3p becomes heavily phosphorylated within its N-terminal region of low complexity, associates with polysomes, and promotes translation of its target mRNAs. Such nutrient-responsive phosphorylation toggles the activity of Puf3p to promote either degradation or translation of these mRNAs according to the needs of the cell. Moreover, activation of translation of pre-existing mRNAs might enable rapid adjustment to environmental changes without the need for de novo transcription. Strikingly, a Puf3p phosphomutant no longer promotes translation but becomes trapped in intracellular foci in an mRNA-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that the inability to properly resolve Puf3p-containing RNA-protein granules via a phosphorylation-based mechanism might be toxic to a cell.

Abstract: Summary
Floor-plate-derived extracellular signaling molecules, including canonical axon guidance cues of the Netrin family, control neuronal circuit organization. Despite the importance of the floor plate as an essential signaling center in the developing vertebrate central nervous system, no systematic approach to identify binding partners for floor-plate-expressed cell-surface and secreted proteins has been carried out. Here, we used a high-throughput assay to discover extracellular protein-protein interactions, which likely take place in the zebrafish floor-plate microenvironment. The assembled floor-plate network contains 47 interactions including the hitherto-not-reported interaction between Netrin-1 and Draxin. We further characterized this interaction, narrowed down the binding interface, and demonstrated that Draxin competes with Netrin receptors for binding to Netrin-1. Our results suggest that Draxin functions as an extracellular Netrin signaling modulator in vertebrates. A reciprocal gradient of Draxin might shape or sharpen the active Netrin gradient, thereby critically modulating its effect.

Abstract: Summary
Deciphering contributions of specific cell types to organ function is experimentally challenging. The Drosophila midgut is a dynamic organ with five morphologically and functionally distinct regions (R1–R5), each composed of multipotent intestinal stem cells (ISCs), progenitor enteroblasts (EBs), enteroendocrine cells (EEs), enterocytes (ECs), and visceral muscle (VM). To characterize cellular specialization and regional function in this organ, we generated RNA-sequencing transcriptomes of all five cell types isolated by FACS from each of the five regions, R1–R5. In doing so, we identify transcriptional diversities among cell types and document regional differences within each cell type that define further specialization. We validate cell-specific and regional Gal4 drivers; demonstrate roles for transporter Smvt and transcription factors GATAe, Sna, and Ptx1 in global and regional ISC regulation, and study the transcriptional response of midgut cells upon infection. The resulting transcriptome database (http://flygutseq.buchonlab.com) will foster studies of regionalization, homeostasis, immunity, and cell-cell interactions.

Rad53-Mediated Regulation of Rrm3 and Pif1 DNA Helicases Contributes to Prevention of Aberrant Fork Transitions under Replication Stress,

Abstract: Summary
Replication stress activates the Mec1ATR and Rad53 kinases. Rad53 phosphorylates nuclear pores to counteract gene gating, thus preventing aberrant transitions at forks approaching transcribed genes. Here, we show that Rrm3 and Pif1, DNA helicases assisting fork progression across pausing sites, are detrimental in rad53 mutants experiencing replication stress. Rrm3 and Pif1 ablations rescue cell lethality, chromosome fragmentation, replisome-fork dissociation, fork reversal, and processing in rad53 cells. Through phosphorylation, Rad53 regulates Rrm3 and Pif1; phospho-mimicking rrm3 mutants ameliorate rad53 phenotypes following replication stress without affecting replication across pausing elements under normal conditions. Hence, the Mec1-Rad53 axis protects fork stability by regulating nuclear pores and DNA helicases. We propose that following replication stress, forks stall in an asymmetric conformation by inhibiting Rrm3 and Pif1, thus impeding lagging strand extension and preventing fork reversal; conversely, under unperturbed conditions, the peculiar conformation of forks encountering pausing sites would depend on active Rrm3 and Pif1.

Abstract: N-acetyl-D-glucosamine kinase (NAGK) plays an enzyme activity-independent, non-canonical role in the dendritogenesis of hippocampal neurons in culture. In this study, we investigated its role in axonal development. We found NAGK was distributed throughout neurons until developmental stage 3 (axonal outgrowth), and that its axonal expression remarkably decreased during stage 4 (dendritic outgrowth) and became negligible in stage 5 (mature). Immunocytochemistry (ICC) showed colocalization of NAGK with tubulin in hippocampal neurons and with Golgi in somata, dendrites, and nascent axons. A proximity ligation assay (PLA) for NAGK and Golgi marker protein followed by ICC for tubulin or dynein light chain roadblock type 1 (DYNLRB1) in stage 3 neurons showed NAGK-Golgi complex colocalized with DYNLRB1 at the tips of microtubule (MT) fibers in axonal growth cones and in somatodendritic areas. PLAs for NAGK-dynein combined with tubulin or Golgi ICC showed similar signal patterns, indicating a three way interaction between NAGK, dynein, and Golgi in growing axons. In addition, overexpression of the NAGK gene and of kinase mutant NAGK genes increased axonal lengths, and knockdown of NAGK by small hairpin (sh) RNA reduced axonal lengths; suggesting a structural role for NAGK in axonal growth. Finally, transfection of ‘DYNLRB1 (74–96)’, a small peptide derived from DYNLRB1’s C-terminal, which binds with NAGK, resulted in neurons with shorter axons in culture. The authors suggest a NAGK-dynein-Golgi tripartite interaction in growing axons is instrumental during early axonal development.

Abstract: Rapid and efficient engulfment of apoptotic cells is an essential property of phagocytes for removal of the large number of apoptotic cells generated in multicellular organisms. To achieve this, phagocytes need to be able to continuously uptake apoptotic cells. It was recently reported that uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) promotes engulfment of apoptotic cells by increasing the phagocytic capacity, thereby allowing cells to continuously ingest apoptotic cells. However, the functions of Ucp2, beyond its possible role in dissipating the mitochondrial membrane potential, that contribute to elevation of the phagocytic capacity have not been determined. Here, we report that the anion transfer or nucleotide binding activity of Ucp2, as well as its dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, is necessary for Ucp2-mediated engulfment of apoptotic cells. To study these properties, we generated Ucp2 mutations that affected three different functions of Ucp2, namely, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, transfer of anions, and binding of purine nucleotides. Mutations of Ucp2 that affected the proton leak did not enhance the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Although anion transfer and nucleotide binding mutations did not affect the mitochondrial membrane potential, they exerted a dominant-negative effect on Ucp2-mediated engulfment. Furthermore, none of our Ucp2 mutations increased the phagocytic capacity. We conclude that dissipation of the proton gradient by Ucp2 is not the only determinant of the phagocytic capacity and that anion transfer or nucleotide binding by Ucp2 is also essential for Ucp2-mediated engulfment of apoptotic cells.

Abstract: Summary
Conventional affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis is a broadly applicable method used to decipher molecular interaction networks and infer protein function. However, it is sensitive to perturbations induced by ectopically overexpressed target proteins and does not reflect multilevel physiological regulation in response to diverse stimuli. Here, we developed an interface between genome editing and proteomics to isolate native protein complexes produced from their natural genomic contexts. We used CRISPR/Cas9 and TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) to tag endogenous genes and purified several DNA repair and chromatin-modifying holoenzymes to near homogeneity. We uncovered subunits and interactions among well-characterized complexes and report the isolation of MCM8/9, highlighting the efficiency and robustness of the approach. These methods improve and simplify both small- and large-scale explorations of protein interactions as well as the study of biochemical activities and structure-function relationships.

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute is a key enzyme of various RNA silencing pathways. We use single-molecule fluorescence measurements to characterize the reaction mechanisms of the core-RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) composed of human Argonaute 2 and a small RNA. We found that target binding of core-RISC starts at the seed region, resulting in four distinct reaction pathways: target cleavage, transient binding, stable binding, and Argonaute unloading. The target cleavage requires extensive sequence complementarity and dramatically accelerates core-RISC recycling. The stable binding of core-RISC is efficiently established with the seed match only, providing a potential explanation for the seed-match rule of miRNA (microRNA) target selection. Target cleavage on perfect-match targets sensitively depends on RNA sequences, providing an insight into designing more efficient siRNAs (small interfering RNAs).
