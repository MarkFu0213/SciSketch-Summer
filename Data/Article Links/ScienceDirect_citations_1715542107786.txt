Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the mitochondrial DNA mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Our previous study identified mitochondrial tRNAIle A4263G mutation in a large Chinese Han family with maternally-inherited hypertension. This mutation may contribute to mitochondrial Ca2+ cycling dysfuntion, but the mechanism is unclear. Lymphoblastoid cell lines were derived from hypertensive and normotensive individuals, either with or without tRNAIle A4263G mutation. The mitochondrial calcium ([Ca2+]m) in cells from hypertensive subjects with the tRNAIle A4263G mutation, was lower than in cells from normotension or hypertension without mutation, or normotension with mutation (P<0.05). Meanwhile, cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]c) in hypertensive with mutation cells was higher than another three groups. After exposure to caffeine, which could increase the [Ca2+]c by activating ryanodine receptor on endoplasmic reticulum, [Ca2+]c/[Ca2+]m increased higher than in hypertensive with mutation cells from another three groups. Moreover, MCU expression was decreased in hypertensive with mutation cells compared with in another three groups (P<0.05). [Ca2+]c increased and [Ca2+]m decreased after treatment with Ru360 (an inhibitor of MCU) or an siRNA against MCU. In this study we found decreased MCU expression in hypertensive with mutation cells contributed to dysregulated Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondria, and cytoplasmic Ca2+ overload. This abnormality might be involved in the underlying mechanisms of maternally inherited hypertension in subjects carrying the mitochondrial tRNAIle A4263G mutation.

Abstract: Ion-implanted poly-crystalline silicon (poly-Si), in combination with a tunnel oxide layer, is investigated as a carrier-selective passivating contact in c-Si solar cells based on an interdigitated back contact (IBC) architecture. The optimized poly-Si passivating contacts enable low interface recombination, resulting in implied VOC (iVOC) of about 720mV and 704mV for n-type and p-type, respectively, before any hydrogenation step. It is found that high-quality passivation can be obtained when confining the dopants within the poly-Si layers and realizing a shallow diffusion of dopants into the c-Si bulk, meaning a sharp decrease in doping concentration in the c-Si at the poly-Si/c-Si interface. The doping profile at the poly-Si/c-Si interface can be influenced by poly-Si layer thickness, poly-Si ion-implantation parameters, and post-implantation annealing conditions. The detailed discussion on the passivation properties of the poly-Si passivating contacts and their preparation conditions are presented in this paper. In addition, IBC solar cells with/without front surface field (FSF) are fabricated, with the optimized poly-Si passivating contacts as back surface field, BSF (n-type poly-Si), and emitter (p-type poly-Si). The best cell shows an efficiency of 21.2% (VOC=692mV, JSC=39.2mA/cm2, FF=78.3%, and pFF=83.5%).

Abstract: Sugar alcohols (SA) are attractive phase change materials for long-term thermal energy storage (TES) applications at low-to-medium temperatures, as i.e. solar seasonal energy storage. Most of them undergo severe undercooling, thus allowing energy storage at temperatures far below the melting point with thermal losses reduction. Besides, some of them could provide very high volumetric energy density at affordable cost. However, sugar alcohols with high latent heat of fusion often exhibit melting temperatures above 100°C. The objective of this work was to found out new sugar alcohol eutectic mixtures that display lower temperatures without significant reduction of the latent heat. A comprehensive analysis of SA relevant properties for TES has been carried out in order to select the most appropriate single SA for mixtures analysis. Sixteen SA-based binary systems have been investigated. Their corresponding phase diagrams have been experimentally and theoretically established. Four eutectic mixtures with potential for long-term TES at temperature around 80°C have been identified. They are: 1) adonitol-erythritol at 30mol% of erythritol, with melting temperature of 87°C and latent heat of fusion of 254J/g; 2) arabitol-erythritol at 40mol% of erythritol, with melting temperature of 86°C and latent heat of fusion of 225J/g; 3) xylitol-erythritol at 36mol% of erythritol, with melting temperature of 82°C and latent heat of fusion of 270J/g; and 4) arabitol-xylitol at 56mol% of xylitol, with melting temperature of 77°C and latent heat of fusion of 243J/g.

Abstract: Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are major public health concerns. Visceral adipose tissue inflammation is considered a significant contributor to obesity-associated T2D development. We previously showed that the flavan-3-ol (−)-epicatechin (EC) can mitigate insulin resistance in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD). This study investigated the capacity of EC to inhibit visceral adipose tissue inflammation occurring as a consequence of HFD consumption in C57BL/6J mice, and characterized the underlying mechanisms. In association with the development of obesity and insulin resistance, HFD consumption caused inflammation in the visceral adipose tissue as evidenced by activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB and increased tissue levels of the macrophage marker F4/80, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and the chemokine MCP-1. EC supplementation mitigated all these events. In addition, we observed activation of the three branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and upregulation of NADPH oxidases NOX4 and NOX2 in visceral fat of mice fed HFD. These can account, at least in part, for the associated oxidative stress and activation of the redox sensitive NF-κB. Notably, EC supplementation mitigated this and the release of pro-inflammatory proteins from metabolically stressed adipocytes. Attenuation of adipocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress by EC could contribute to decreased inflammation and improved visceral adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. Our results support the concept that consumption of EC-rich foods could mitigate obesity-associated insulin resistance through attenuation of adipose tissue inflammation.

Abstract: This article examines current cost drivers and potential avenues to reduced cost for monolithic, glass–glass Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 (CIGS) modules by constructing a comprehensive bottom-up cost model. For a reference case where sputtering plus batch sulfurization after selenization (SAS) is employed, we compute a manufacturing cost of $69/m2 if the modules are made in the United States at a 1GW/year production volume. At 14% module efficiency, this corresponds to a manufacturing cost of $0.49/WDC and a minimum sustainable price (MSP) of $0.67/WDC. We estimate that MSP could vary within ±20% of this value given the range of quoted input prices, and existing variations in module design, manufacturing processes, and manufacturing location. Potential for reduction in manufacturing costs to below $0.40/WDC may be possible if average production module efficiencies can be increased above 17% without increasing $/m2 costs; even lower costs could be achieved if $/m2 costs could be reduced, particularly via innovations in the CIGS deposition process or balance-of-module elements. We present the impact on cost of regional factors, CIGS deposition method, device design, and price fluctuations. One metric of competitiveness-levelized cost of energy (LCOE) – is also assessed for several U.S. locations and compared to that of standard multi-crystalline silicon (m(c-Si)) and cadmium telluride (CdTe).

Abstract: Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an ultra-rare inborn error of metabolism associated with a defective catabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine leading to increased systemic levels of homogentisic acid (HGA). Excess HGA is partly excreted in the urine, partly accumulated within the body and deposited onto connective tissues under the form of an ochronotic pigment, leading to a range of clinical manifestations. No clear genotype/phenotype correlation was found in AKU, and today there is the urgent need to identify biomarkers able to monitor AKU progression and evaluate response to treatment. With this aim, we provided the first proteomic study on serum and plasma samples from alkaptonuric individuals showing pathological SAA, CRP and Advanced Oxidation Protein Products (AOPP) levels. Interesting similarities with proteomic studies on other rheumatic diseases were highlighted together with proteome alterations supporting the existence of oxidative stress and inflammation in AKU. Potential candidate biomarkers to assess disease severity, monitor disease progression and evaluate response to treatment were identified as well.

Abstract: Folate deficiency contributes to impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. Here we use HT-22 hippocampal neuron cells as model to investigate the effect of folate deprivation (FD) on cell proliferation and apoptosis, and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. FD caused cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and increased the rate of apoptosis, which was associated with disrupted expression of folate transport and methyl transfer genes. FOLR1 and SLC46A1 were (P<0.01) down-regulated, while SLC19A1 was up-regulated (P<0.01) in FD group. FD cells exhibited significantly (P<0.05) higher protein content of BHMT, MAT2b and DNMT3a, as well as increased SAM/SAH concentrations and global DNA hypermethylation. The expression of the total and all the 3 classes of IGF-1 mRNA variants was significantly (P<0.01) down-regulated and IGF-1 concentration was decreased (P<0.05) in the culture media. IGF-1 signaling pathway was also compromised with diminished activation (P<0.05) of STAT3, AKT and mTOR. CpG hypermethylation was detected in the promoter regions of IGF-1 and FOLR1 genes, while higher SLC19A1 mRNA corresponded to hypomethylation of its promoter. IGF-1 supplementation in FD media significantly abolished FD-induced decrease in cell viability. However, IGF-1 had limited effect in rescuing the cell phenotype when added 24h after FD. Taken together, down-regulation of IGF-1 expression and signaling is involved in FD-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HT-22 hippocampal neuron cells, which is associated with an abnormal activation of methyl transfer pathway and hypermethylation of IGF-1 gene promoter.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes significant morbidity and mortality in CMV seropositive patients undergoing umbilical cord blood transplants (UCBT). Our study aimed to describe the incidence of CMV reactivation and burden of disease, as well as the tolerability of an intensive prevention strategy as compared to historical prevention.
Methods
This was a retrospective chart review of 33 CMV seropositive patients that underwent UCBT. The intensive prevention strategy in UCBT consisted of ganciclovir 5mg/kg/d intravenously or valganciclovir 900mg by mouth daily initiated at the beginning of the conditioning regimen until Day −2. Then from Day −1 to Day +100, patients received valacyclovir 2g by mouth three times daily, and from Day +101 to Day +365, acyclovir 800mg by mouth twice daily. Historical standard prevention was acyclovir 800mg by mouth twice daily initiated at the beginning of the conditioning regimen until Day +365.
Results
Thirty-three patients were included from 2008 to 2014. There were no differences in the adverse effects experienced between the two regimens (p=.4). CMV reactivation occurred significantly later with intensive prevention (p=.003). The median CMV viral titer at reactivation was lower in the intensive versus the historic prevention (1,800copies/mL and 2,700copies/mL, respectively), but was not significantly different. CMV disease occurred significantly less often in the intensive group (p=.039).
Conclusion
The results from this study indicate that the intensive prevention strategy was well tolerated, significantly delayed CMV reactivation, and patients had less CMV disease.

Abstract: A novel four-layered Mo/AlCrON(HMVF)/AlCrNO(LMVF)/AlCrOx tandem coating was designed and fabricated by cathodic arc ion plating for solar-thermal conversion applications. The chemical composition, structures and thermal stability of the coating were systematically investigated by SEM, EPMA, XRD, TEM, XPS and Raman. The optical properties of the as-deposited and annealed coatings were measured by spectrophotometers. The high-temperature emittance of the coating was measured by a steady-state measurement system. Results showed that tandem coating exhibited a high solar absorptance of 0.921, and a low emittance of 0.12 at 25°C, as well as emittance of 0.26–0.35 at temperatures range of 300−519°C. The structure analysis showed that the nano-multilayered structured HMVF and LMVF layers, acting as the main absorber, were consisted of the Cr2Al nanograins embedding in the amorphous AlCrON phases. While the top AlCrOx layer was amorphous in nature, and could act as an antireflection layer. After heat-treatment at 600°C in air for 7 days, only slight microstructure changes were observed from the tandem coating, and very similar solar selectivity of 0.922/0.14 to the as-deposited one was obtained, which indicated the relatively good thermal stability of the coating. These results indicated that the coating could be possibly applied to the high temperature solar-thermal conversion system.

Abstract: PPARγ agonists induced obesity in animal models as a side effect. Microarray experiments reveal that PPARγ agonist upregulates the expression of lipin-1 and this upregulation is correlated with the activity of the agonists. Lipin-1 induced by PPARγ agonists decreased the levels of PPARγ and ERK1/2 phosphorylation through direct interaction with these proteins in 3T3-L1 cells. In PPARγ agonist-treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the knockdown of lipin-1 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited the adipogenesis that was induced by PPARγ agonists. In contrast, PPARγ2 expression was increased, and lipid droplets were accumulated in lipin-1-overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Rosiglitazone (RGZ), a strong PPARγ agonist, synergistically promoted PPARγ dephosphorylation and adipogenesis in lipin-1-overexpressing 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Therefore, lipin-1 has dual functions as a transcriptional cofactor and phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) in the differentiation of preadipocyte cells induced by strong PPARγ agonists. In addition, the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells was markedly upregulated by diacylglycerol (DAG), which was produced by lipin-1. Therefore, lipin-1 induction by PPARγ agonists might be an important factor in understanding the biological mechanism of the agonists’ adverse effects, and this information may be valuable in the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) therapeutics with reduced adverse effects and greater tolerability.

RANKL promotes osteoblastic activity in vascular smooth muscle cells by upregulating endothelial BMP-2 release,

Abstract: Introduction
Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta-ligand (RANKL) is thought to promote vascular calcification (VC) by inducing osteoblastic behaviour in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in an ill-defined process. The present study assessed whether RANKL affects pro-osteoblastic paracrine signalling between human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) using both conditioned media transfer and cell co-culture experimental approaches.
Methods and results
For initial experiments (6-well format), HAEC-conditioned media was harvested following 72h exposure to RANKL, and transferred to reporter HASMCs with/without noggin, an inhibitor of pro-osteoblastic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) paracrine signalling. In further experiments, HAECs and HASMCs were co-cultured within the CellMax® Duo, a perfusing bioreactor unit that mimics the flow-mediated co-interaction of these cells within the arterial wall, and RANKL was added to the perfusing media for 72h. At the conclusion of each experiment markers of osteoblastic activity were measured in HASMCs, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mRNA levels of ALP and Runx2, as well as BMP-2 and BMP-4 concentrations. RANKL increased BMP-2 release from HAECs, while exposure of HASMCs to RANKL-treated HAEC-conditioned media induced osteoblastic behaviour in HASMCs, an effect prevented by noggin. Within the CellMax® Duo bioreactor, the addition of RANKL to the intraluminal HAECs also produced an increase in BMP-2 and increased osteoblastic behaviour within the co-cultured HASMC population.
Conclusions
RANKL promotes VC by inducing BMP-2 release from HAECs, which in turn appears to act in a paracrine fashion on the adjacent HASMC population to increase osteoblastic activity.

Abstract: All-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic system, especially driven by visible light, has attracted intensive interests for realizing sustainable development addressing the increasing environmental pollution and energy issues. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) as one of the most studied semiconductor photocatalysts has been widely applied in solving the above issues. And graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a steady and earth-abundant non-metallic visible-light photocatalyst. Here we demonstrate a facile and rapid method to successfully synthesize all-solid-state Z-scheme g-C3N4/TiO2 nanotube arrays which demonstrates enhanced photocatalytic performance than photocatalyst prepared by traditional post-synthesis under visible light irradiation.

Abstract: The development of photoactive materials with self-cleaning and depolluting qualities is a hot topic in materials science, given their impact on several technologies, in a wide range of contexts of applications. Anatase phase titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the largest used photocatalyst, with increasing applications ranging from air quality control to renewable energies, to green building materials for zero energy communities. Yet, it is partially transmissive in the near infrared (NIR), which negatively affects the solar reflectance of TiO2 containing materials. In this contribution we describe an unexpected increase in anatase near infrared (NIR) reflectance observed during environmental exposure. We unveil its complex mechanisms, based on the contact with nitric acid generated by NOx photocatalytic degradation, which causes partial reduction and decrease in crystallinity to TiO2. This may open the way for introducing multiple environmentally beneficial effects on TiO2 pollutants degradation, self-cleaning, and energy performance.

Abstract: Spectrum down-shifting converters based on Cd-free Zn–Cu–In–S(ZCIS)/ZnS core/shell quantum dots are modeled and simulated for applications in photovoltaics using the Monte-Carlo approach. The set of physical characteristics required for the successful implementation of this type of material in spectral converters have been identified. The advantage of using ZCIS/ZnS quantum dots in such converters is highlighted through a comparison with the conventional CdSe/ZnS quantum dots. The simulation model has been evaluated experimentally using ZCIS/ZnS quantum dots dispersed in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a spectrally converting top layer. In addition to validating the utility and precision of the simulation, it is shown that the polymerization of polydimethylsiloxane does not significantly impede the photoluminescent quantum yield of the ZCIS/ZnS quantum dots.

Abstract: Nanoporous SiO2 antireflective films and films additionally incorporating larger particles in this matrix were prepared by sol-gel processing; the latter exhibits a randomly corrugated surface pattern. Both films show a significant anti-soiling effect versus standardized test dust materials of different particle size distributions. The surface coverages determined by laser scanning microscopy were correlated to the respective optical properties. These laboratory results were compared to long-term outdoor exposure experiments performed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A vast potential of sol-gel derived coatings for anti-soiling applications is demonstrated, nevertheless the high complexity of the particle-surface interaction mechanisms cannot be underestimated.

Abstract: We investigate the properties of silver thick film contacts on phosphorus doped alkaline textured silicon surfaces with varying surface doping levels. Using scanning electron microscopy, we find that the surface near doping concentration influences the formation of silver crystallites especially those that are in direct contact with both the silicon surface and the contact finger. The observed correlation between direct silver crystallite imprint coverage and specific contact resistance allows for extracting the specific contact resistance of individual crystallites to be approximately 3.3µΩcm2, which agrees well with theoretical predictions. Furthermore we present a new approach that allows for a quantitative separation of direct and indirect current conduction channels. For our experimental conditions, the assumption of current conduction exclusively by transport through silver crystallites adequately describes the experimental data. Finally we fabricate bifacial n-type solar cells with peak efficiencies of 19.9%.

Abstract: Rotational flexographic printing technology is a highly promising approach to increase the productivity of the cost-intensive solar cell metallization process. The ability to realize narrow contact fingers with very low silver consumption makes this technology particularly attractive for the front side metallization of busbarless solar cells in combination with multi-wire interconnection like Meyer Burger’s SmartWire Connection Technology (SWCT). Within this work, we investigate the feasibility of this approach on solar cells with 156mm edge length. Two types of silver inks are prepared and evaluated with focus on optical and electrical properties of the printed front side grid. Both inks achieve sufficient lateral finger resistances below 20Ω/cm. A low specific contact resistance of ρc,95%=3.0±0.6mΩcm2 is obtained with ink A. Using flexographic printing, Aluminum back surface field Czrochalski-grown Silicon busbarless solar cells with a maximum conversion efficiency of η=19.4% (η∅=19.0%) are fabricated and interconnected to a mini-module. The mini-module obtains an aperture conversion efficiency of η=15.8%. The origin of the cell-to-module (CTM) losses are examined in detail. It is shown that a certain part of the CTM-losses originates from the characteristics of the used GridTOUCH I–V-measurement device. Further sources of possible CTM losses are investigated using electroluminescence measurement (EL) and discussed in detail.

Abstract: Recent suggestions that worthwhile additional cooling of 1.0–1.5°C below what glass covers in solar cell modules already achieve, hence raised power output, will occur via enhanced thermal radiation to the sky with special nanostructures, is examined. Rigorous thermal models indicate these observations require a much lower hemispherical emittance (EH) for the benchmarks of silica and glass covers near 0.75. If the currently accepted value for EH of glass of 0.84 applied even EH=1.0 would provide inadequate extra cooling. An accurate angular emittance profile for glass does predict this lower EH. Complete models include solar heating, heating by atmospheric radiation, cooling by convection and side/base losses. Unfortunately any large lift in radiative output from raised EH at normal cell temperatures is mostly annulled by the accompanying fall in convective cooling. The link of EH to angular IR response points the way to novel coating approaches which may achieve the desired cooling gains. This has wider implications for buildings and other solar technologies. Direct power gains from accompanying anti-reflectance add value.

Abstract: Objective
Norisoboldine (NOR), an isoquinoline alkaloid with very poor oral bioavailability, was previously proven to have a unique anti-arthritis activity in rats by inducing intestinal Treg cells. Herein, we explored its underlying mechanism in view of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).
Methods
The differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and IL-17-producing T cells (Th17 cells) from naïve T cells was analyzed in vitro. The key role of AhR was ascertained using siRNA transfection. AhR agonistic effect was verified based on the activation of downstream signaling pathway and target genes. The correlation between AhR activation and Treg cell induction as well as pathological changes of joints was confirmed in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model.
Results
NOR promoted intestinal Treg cell differentiation and function in an AhR-dependent manner. It acted as an AhR agonist, as evidenced by induction of CYP1A1 expression and activity, promotion of AhR/Hsp90 dissociation and AhR nuclear translocation, induction of XRE reporter activity, and facilitation of AhR/XRE binding. In CIA mice, NOR exerted substantial anti-arthritic effect through enhancing AhR activation in intestinal tissues and inducing intestinal Treg cell generation, which could be largely abolished by resveratrol (a antagonist of AhR). An adoptive transfer of Treg cells from NOR-treated mice could successfully alleviate arthritis symptoms in CIA mice.
Conclusion
Oral NOR induces the generation of intestinal Treg cells by the activation of AhR, and thereby exerts anti-arthritic effect.

Abstract: Objective/background
The use of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in the emergency department (ED) for patients suspected to have pulmonary embolism (PE) has been steadily rising in the last 2decades. However, there are limited studies that specifically address the use of CTPA in the ED for cancer patients suspected to have PE. The objective of this study is to assess the rate of positive PE by CTPA in the ED in cancer patients and the variables that are associated with positive results.
Methods
A retrospective review of electronic medical records for 208 consecutive patients with cancer who presented to the ED and received a CTPA for suspected PE over a 12-month period. The review included demographics, type and status of cancer, presenting symptoms, CTPA results, calculation of Wells Score, management based on CT findings, and outcome of patients.
Results
Among the 208 patients who met the inclusion criteria during our study period (mean age 57±13.37years, 73% women, 59% African American, and 32% Caucasians), 5.7% were diagnosed with PE. One hundred and eighty-two (83.7%) had a Wells Score ⩽4, of which 2.2% were found to have to have PE, 22 (16.3%) patients had a Wells Score >4, of which 36.4% were found to have PE (p<.0001). Sensitivity and specificity of Wells >4 was 66.7% and 92.9%, respectively, with an odds ratio of 27 (95% CI 6.6–113.6). Receiver operator characteristics area under the curve for Wells Score was 0.868. Age, race, sex, malignancy type, stage, status, clinical presentation, D-dimer, and a previous history of venous thromboembolism were not found to have statistically significant predictive values.
Conclusion
The yield of CTPA to rule out PE in patients with cancer presenting in the ED is low. Following a validated decision-making protocol such as Wells Criteria may significantly decrease the number of CTPA used in the ED.

Abstract: Substrate configuration CdTe/CdS solar cells were fabricated directly on 25nm thick single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) back contacts using a high temperature, commercial deposition process. No copper was introduced to facilitate the formation of an ohmic back contact at the back of the device. The champion device had an efficiency of 6.5%. The thin SWCNT layer allowed the device to be illuminated through the back contact, and a comparison of the device performance with front and backside illumination revealed several novel features of the SWCNT back contact. Our findings indicate that SWCNT films may be useful as a recombination layer contact for bifacial solar cells, photovoltaic windows, or two-terminal thin-film tandem solar cells.

Abstract: Epigenetic regulation by histone methyltransferase G9a is known to control autophagic responses. As the link between autophagy and metabolic homeostasis is widely accepted, we investigated whether G9a affects metabolic circuitries to affect autophagic response in glioma cells. Both pharmacological inhibition and siRNA mediated knockdown of G9a increased autophagy marker LC3B in glioma cells. G9a inhibitor BIX-01294 (BIX) induced Akt-dependent increase in HIF-1α expression and activity. Inhibition of Akt-HIF-1α axis reversed BIX-mediated (i) increase in LC3B expression and (ii) decrease in Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) phosphorylation. YAP1 over-expression abrogated BIX induced increase in LC3B expression. Interestingly, BIX induced increase in metabolic modelers TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator) and PKM2 (Pyruvate kinase M2) were crucial for BIX-mediated changes, as transfection with TIGAR mutant or PKM2 siRNA reversed BIX-mediated alterations in pYAP1 and LC3B expression. Coherent with the in vitro observation, BIX had no significant effect on the tumor burden in heterotypic xenograft glioma mouse model. Elevated LC3B and PKM2 in BIX-treated xenograft tissue was accompanied by decreased YAP1 levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that Akt-HIF-1α axis driven PKM2-YAP1 cross talk activates autophagic responses in glioma cells upon G9a inhibition.

Abstract: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is frequently encountered in hospitalized patients where it is associated with increased mortality and morbidity notably affecting muscle wasting. Increased protein degradation has been shown to be the main actor of AKI-induced muscle atrophy, but the proteolytic pathways involved are poorly known. The Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is almost systematically activated in various catabolic situations, and the E3 ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx are generally up regulated in atrophying muscles. We hypothesized that the UPS may be one of the main actors in catabolic skeletal muscles from AKI animals. We used gentamicin-induced acute kidney disease (G-AKI) in rats fed a high protein diet to promote acidosis. We first addressed the impact of G-AKI in the development of mild catabolic conditions. We found that both muscle atrophy and UPS activation were induced with the development of G-AKI. In addition, the phasic muscles were more sensitive to 7-days G-AKI (−11 to −17%, P<0.05) than the antigravity soleus muscle (−11%, NS), indicating a differential impact of AKI in the musculature. We observed an increased expression of the muscle-specific E3 ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx in phasic muscles that was highly correlated to the G-AKI severity (R2=0.64, P<0.01 and R2=0.71, P<0.005 respectively). Conversely, we observed no variation in the expression of three other E3 ligases (Nedd4, Trim32 and Fbxo30/MUSA1). Altogether, our data indicate that MuRF1 and MAFbx are sensitive markers and potential targets to prevent muscle atrophy during G-AKI.

Abstract: Here we present efficient upscaling of organic solar cell (OSC) to an active area of ~50.4cm2 from 0.09cm2 using spin coating technique from solution processing. The Solar cell consists of ITO/ZnO/Absorber layer (PBDTTT-C:PC71BM)/MoO3/Ag layer and ZnO and absorber layer were coated through spin coating. A mechanical patterning machine was introduced in the fabrication process to make monolithic integrated module for any practical application. All the small area device and module were fabricated and tested in similar conditions. The OSC module (area ~50.4cm2) shows an active area efficiency of 5.4% which is slightly lower than the efficiency (7.3%) of small area OSC (0.09cm2). The open circuit voltage of module shows only ~4% drop whereas the current density shows a drop of ~8% while upscaling to an active area by >500 times. This reported monolithic integrated OSC module performance is due to uniform film thickness with low roughness values at center as well as corner positions obtained by spin coating technique. This demonstrates that spin coating process is suitable for upscaling of organic solar cells.

Abstract: Autophagy is an intracellular defense mechanism responsible for the turnover of damaged or non-functional cellular constituents. This process provides cells with energy and essential compounds under unfavorable environmental conditions—such as oxidative stress and hyperglycemia, which are both observed in diabetes. The most common diabetes complication is diabetic nephropathy (DN), which can lead to renal failure. This condition often includes impaired podocyte function. Here we investigated autophagic activity in rat podocytes cultured with a high insulin concentration (300nM). Autophagy was activated after 60min of insulin stimulation. Moreover, this effect was abolished following pharmacological (apocynin) or genetic (siRNA) inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase activity, indicating that insulin-dependent autophagy stimulation involved reactive oxygen species (ROS). We also observed a continuous and time-dependent increase of podocyte albumin permeability in response to insulin, and this process was slightly improved by autophagy inhibition following short-term insulin exposure. Our results suggest that insulin may be a factor affecting the development of diabetic nephropathy.

Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs are involved in regulating immune response and metabolism, which are among the most fundamental requirements for survival. Here we investigate the contribution and mechanism of microRNA-130a/b in controlling metabolism-related inflammation. Our findings indicate that miR-130a/b significantly inhibits TNFα and Sp1 expression by directly binding to their 3'-untranslated regions. Overexpressed miR-130a/b decreases the NF-κB mRNA and protein levels by shortening mRNA half-life. In mice primary hepatocytes, over-expressed miR-130a/b ameliorates the up-regulation of TNFα, Sp1, NF-κB and PPARγ translational levels elicited by LPS or FFAs treatment. Further, C/EBPα attenuates the promoter activity of miR-130a, but enhances that of miR-130b. The progressive deletions and mutations show that the C/EBPα binding motif situated at −1033/−1021bp or −130/−116bp region of miR-130a or b promoter respectively is an essential component required for their promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays reveal that C/EBPα can directly interact with miR-130a/b promoter DNA. Conclusively, these data suggest that miR-130a/b, regulated transcriptionally by C/EBPα, can control metabolism-related inflammatory process through inhibiting Sp1-TLR4-NF-κB/P65-TNFα pathway and regulating translational levels of PPARγ and other key genes involved in lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Aldehyde dehydrogenases participate in a variety of cellular homeostatic mechanisms like metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, whereas recently, they have been implicated in normal and cancer cell stemness. We explored roles for ALDH3A1 in conferring resistance to chemotherapeutics/radiation/oxidative stress and whether ectopic overexpression of ALDH3A1 could lead to alterations of gene expression profile associated with cancer stem cell-like phenotype. MCF-7 cells were stably transfected either with an empty vector (mock) or human aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 cDNA. The expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 in MCF-7 cells was associated with altered cell proliferation rate and enhanced cell resistance against various chemotherapeutic drugs (4-hydroxyperoxycyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, and 5-fluorouracil). Aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 expression also led to increased tolerance of MCF-7 cells to gamma radiation and hydrogen peroxide-induced stress. Furthermore, aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1-expressing MCF-7 cells exhibited gene up-regulation of cyclins A, B1, B2, and down-regulation of cyclin D1 as well as transcription factors p21, CXR4, Notch1, SOX2, SOX4, OCT4, and JAG1. When compared to mock cells, no changes were observed in mRNA levels of ABCA2 and ABCB1 protein pumps with only a minor decrease of the ABCG2 pump in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1-expressing cells. Also, the adhesion molecules EpCAM and CD49F were also found to be up-regulated in aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1expressing cells. Taken together, ALDH3A1 confers a multi-modality resistance phenotype in MCF-7 cells associated with slower growth rate, increased clonogenic capacity, and altered gene expression profile, underlining its significance in cell homeostasis.

Abstract: Objective/background
May–Hegglin anomaly (MHA) is a rare familial bleeding disorder characterized by a triad of thrombocytopenia, giant platelets, and Döhle-like inclusion bodies within the leukocytes. The clinical spectrum as well as the pathophysiology of this entity is not well defined. The objective of this work is to present a series of three cases of MHA diagnosed in our hospital, where the patients presented with variable bleeding manifestations, thrombocytopenia, and giant platelets.
Materials and Methods
We studied three cases of possible MHA. In addition to the clinical examination, complete hemogram, and peripheral blood smear examination, these patients were also subjected to coagulation studies. Although bleeding symptoms varied among these patients, platelet aggregation tests with various agonists showed a normal response.
Results
Consistent findings of this entity noted in our patients were mild-to-moderate thrombocytopenia, giant platelets, and Döhle-like inclusions within the leukocytes.
Conclusion
A diagnosis of MHA could be made based on a thorough peripheral blood smear examination, which also helps to avoid a misdiagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia.

Abstract: NiOx thin films approximately 300nm thick were deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates by magnetron sputtering. Their electrochromic properties were tested in a 1M potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous solution and in a 1M lithium perchlorate dissolved in propylene carbonate (LiClO4-PC) anhydrous electrolyte, respectively. The evolution of the lattice structure, surface morphology, chemical composition, optical transmittance modulation, cyclic voltammograms, inserted and extracted charge capacities of NiOx thin films was evaluated as a function of the number of cycles. Even though the cyclic voltammograms and the charge capacity present a similar variation tendency during 1000 cycles, significant differences between cycling in 1M KOH and 1M LiClO4-PC were observed. In 1M KOH, X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that the lattice planes (111) and (200) had a larger shift toward higher diffraction angles, and SEM images exhibited that cracks emerged more quickly from the surface of NiOx thin film during the cycling process. More importantly, the optical modulation varying from 58.5% to 32.9% presented an obvious degradation after 1000 cycles. On the contrary, in 1M LiClO4-PC, NiOx thin films presented a better cyclic durability and a stable optical modulation approximating 41%. In a second step, an all-solid-state complementary electrochromic device with an ITO/WO3/LiClO4-PC-PMMA/NiOx/ITO structure was assembled. The device had an average optical modulation of 51.7% in the visible region and an excellent cyclic durability (over 50,000 times). In situ optical transmittance spectra showed that, in the initial cycles, the response time was 4.5s for the coloring process and 1.7s for the bleaching process. After 1000 cycles, both were delayed to 5.0s and 2.9s, respectively. In addition, open circuit memory of the device was characterized by the optical transmittance variation plotted against time after disconnection of the external circuit.

Abstract: Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate in the central nervous system. Among the eight subtypes, mGluR1 and mGluR5 belong to the group I family. These receptors play important roles in the brain and are believed to be involved in multiple forms of experience dependent synaptic plasticity including learning and memory. In addition, group I mGluRs also have been implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders like Fragile X syndrome, autism etc. The normal signaling depends on the precise location of these receptors in specific region of the neuron and the process of receptor trafficking plays a crucial role in controlling this localization. Intracellular trafficking could also regulate the desensitization, resensitization, down-regulation and intracellular signaling of these receptors. In this review I focus on the current understanding of group I mGluR regulation in the central nervous system and also their role in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) has been shown to be associated with glucose-induced deterioration of pancreatic beta cell function in diabetes. However, whether epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the regulation of TXNIP gene expression by glucose is not clear. Here we studied how glucose exerts its effect on TXNIP gene expression via modulation of histone acetylation marks. To achieve this, we applied clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) to knock out histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300 in a rat pancreatic beta cell line INS1 832/13. We also treated the cells and human islets with chemical inhibitors of HAT p300 and histone deacetylase (HDAC). In human islets, diabetes and high glucose resulted in elevated TXNIP and EP300 expression, and glucose-induced TXNIP expression could be reversed by p300 inhibitor C646. In INS1 832/13 cells, Ep300 knock-out by CRISPR/Cas9 elevated glucose-induced insulin secretion and greatly reduced glucose-stimulated Txnip expression and cell apoptosis. This effect could be ascribed to decrease in histone marks H3K9ac and H4ac at the promoter and first coding region of the Txnip gene. Histone marks H3K9ac and H4ac in the Txnip gene in the wild-type cells was inhibited by HDAC inhibitor at high glucose, which most likely was due to enhanced acetylation levels of p300 after HDAC inhibition; and thereby reduced p300 binding to the Txnip gene promoter region. Such inhibition was absent in the Ep300 knock-out cells. Our study provides evidence that histone acetylation serves as a key regulator of glucose-induced increase in TXNIP gene expression and thereby glucotoxicity-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of realistic illumination conditions on solar module performance is of utmost importance for manufacturers and customers. Standard testing conditions define only one spectrum with normal incidence to measure the performance of solar modules and thus have only limited value for comparing different solar modules. Considering the angular and spectral distribution of photons over a year is vital for improving modules under more realistic conditions, e.g. by using ray tracing to optimize design and materials. Furthermore, the angular and spectral distribution of solar irradiance directly impacts on optimizing the module orientation of fixed solar systems. In most cases, however, measured data on irradiance is constraint to integral values of global, direct and diffuse radiation. In this work, we calculate the angular and spectral distribution of direct and diffuse irradiation based on measured time-resolved integral values for diffuse and direct irradiation. The procedure is implemented in the SunCalculator software.

Abstract: Hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor for acute pancreatitis, in which the pathological mechanisms are not fully illustrated. Intracellular inflammatory response is a key pathological response in acute pancreatitis and endoplasmic reticulum stress has been suggested to induce inflammation and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein expression. Therefore, the current study aims to elucidate the possible relationship between endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation in hypertriglyceridemia associated pancreatitis and the possible involvement of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein. In cholecystokinin-8 stimulated rat primary acinar cells, incubation with palmitic acid caused the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammatory responses. Pre-incubation with the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid inhibited inflammatory responses induced by palmitic acid, whereas stimulation with the endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer thapsigargin alone induced inflammatory responses. Meanwhile we found that the transcription factors CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β were also induced in the palmitic acid-stimulated pancreatic acinar cells, and were similarly inhibited by 4-phenylbutyric acid pre-incubation and induced by thapsigargin stimulation alone, indicating that endoplasmic reticulum stress was responsible for CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β induction in the pancreatic acinar cells. Knockdown of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β by siRNA transfection inhibited inflammatory responses and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α induction but did not affect endoplasmic reticulum stress. Our study provides strong evidence that in response to palmitic acid stimulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress induces inflammatory responses in pancreatic acinar cells through induction of the CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein family, wherein CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β activation is responsible for CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α activation.

Abstract: Below we present semiempirical modeling of conceptually new three-sublayer photoanode, composed of Absorber, Grading and Barrier sublayers, for highly efficient photoelectrochemical water dissociation. The modeling resulted into Absorber (Sub-A) made of Cd0.55Zn0.45O due to its favorable positions of the band extrema to the water splitting potentials and a band gap ~2.0eV. The Grading layer (Sub-G) was composed of CdxZn1−xO with a gradual decrease of x across the profile, changing from 0.2 to 0.55, aiming to photon absorption from 2.0 to 3.0eV. At the same time, Sub-G furnishes the profile with an implanted electrical field that improves the hole-transport. The electron Barrier layer (Sub-B) deposited above the Sub-A, was engineered to provide 1eV high barrier in the conduction band. It comprised of a 50nm thick Ni0.4Cd0.6O film with Eg~3.0eV with a valence band aligned to the one of the Sub-A, providing a barrier-free hole-flow. In this paper, we provide evidence that the proposed three-sublayer concept clearly represents a new paradigm for an improved efficiency for photocatalytic water dissociation. The highest photocatalytic activity of the optimized profile was achieved with an optimized electrolyte: 87% 1M K2HPO4 and 13% 1M Na2SO3 (known to act as a hole scavenger or sacrificial agent) at pH=10. A noteworthy feature of this study is that under optimized profile parameters and customized electrolyte conditions the photocurrent yields increased from ~0.05mA/cm2 to ~20mA/cm2 at +1.2V for visible light. The observed Incident Photon-to-Current Efficiency (IPCE) was about 50% measured at a photon energy of 3eV.

Abstract: We demonstrate single junction and tandem solar cells using an ultrathin (35nm) hydrogenated amorphous silicon germanium absorber which is deposited by hot wire chemical vapor deposition within only 90s. We take advantage of the extremely small thickness of the absorber layer and the capability of hot wire chemical deposition to create conformal layers, by fabricating solar cells on morphologies consisting of self-assembled zinc oxide nanorods. We created solar cells in tandem configuration using the hydrogenated amorphous silicon germanium absorber layer in the bottom cell. Our cells include a cell structure that is “vertical”, which has great potential for high photocurrent generation. We show that the nanorod morphology particularly improves the generation of current in the bottom cell.

Abstract: Pure chlorobenzene (CBZ) and 2-propanol (IPA) or mixed-solvent assisted spin-coating have been applied to one-step fabricate CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite films, respectively. However, with the treatment of pure- or mixed solvent, there are obvious differences in the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite films with full coverage and large crystal grain size, as well as the role in the photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, the nucleation and growth dynamics of perovskite crystals have been taken into consideration with the activation energy of transporting crystallizing segments across the crystal interface and the formation free energy of a critical-sized nucleus. Planar heterojunction (PHJ) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on CH3NH3PbI3 by mixed-solvent treatment exhibit a poor power conversion efficiency (PCE) owing to the formation little amount of perovskite crystals with low crystallinity. While pure CBZ treatment renders the corresponding device get efficiency of 8.1%, which is due to the formation of uniform CH3NH3PbI3 thin film with higher surface coverage and crystallinity. Inversely, PSCs based on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx with mixed-solvent shows the highest PCE of 9.2%, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.06mA/cm2 and fill factor (FF) of 63.6% with high device reproducibility and low photocurrent hysteresis, because of possessing higher light absorption ascribed from bigger crystal size and better surface morphology with no pin-holes. These results will provide significant guidance for CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite device performance optimization and large-scale application by pure- and mixed-solvent treatment.

Abstract: The photoluminescent polarization properties of organic halide perovskites are of great importance for the fundamental understanding and for device fabrication, while limited relevant work has been published. In this work we investigate the fluorescence polarization properties of the CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, and CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskites which have been used in some of the highly efficient solar device to date. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements were conducted on these perovskites fabricated by different methods, and with or without the capping hole transport layer. We demonstrate that CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite exhibits isotropic fluorescence polarization while CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskites exhibit anisotropic fluorescence polarization. The composition influences significantly fluorescence anisotropy dynamics while fabrication has relatively weaker influence. The hole transport capping layer can accelerate the decay of the fluorescence anisotropy. The symmetry of perovskite structure is proposed to be the key factor to impact the fluorescence anisotropy.

Abstract: Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate is a widely used polymer in the optoelectronics industry, its optical properties, such as light transmittance, haze, etc., are of significant importance in organic light emitting diodes and photovoltaics. In this paper, we present a broadband anti-reflective nanostructure on PET substrate prepared by means of plasma etching in a mixture of argon and oxygen gas. Etching time was varied for optimizing the optical transmittance. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images revealed formation of nanostructures of sub-wavelength dimensions resembling pores at the surface. Atomic force microscopy confirmed that the graded porosity was generated from the randomly distributed pores of different sizes and depths. Due to the formation of a gradient refractive index, nanostructured surface exhibited broadband and quasi-omnidirectional anti-reflection properties. A maximum total transmittance of ~99% at 835nm was achieved for both sides treated PET without significant increase in light scattering or haze. Moreover, both sides treated PET showed polarization insensitivity upto 48°, which was not exhibited by untreated PET. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed generation of degradation products, which consisted of carbon and oxygen containing functional groups. Durability of the anti-reflection layer was tested and proved to be satisfactory.

Abstract: As electromagnetic field (EMF) is commonly encountered within our daily lives, the biological effects of EMF are of great concern. Autophagy is a key process for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and it can also reveal cellular responses to environmental stimuli. In this study, we aim to investigate the biological effects of a 50Hz-sinusoidal electromagnetic field on autophagy and we identified its mechanism of action in Chinese Hamster Lung (CHL) cells. CHL cells were exposed to a 50Hz sinusoidal EMF at 0.4mT for 30min or 24h. In this study, we found that a 0.4mT EMF resulted in: (i) an increase in LC3-II expression and increased autophagosome formation; (ii) no significant difference in the incidence of γH2AX foci between the sham and exposure groups; (iii) reorganized actin filaments and increased pseudopodial extensions without promoting cell migration; and (iv) enhanced cell apoptosis when autophagy was blocked by Bafilomycin A1. These results implied that DNA damage was not directly involved in the autophagy induced by a 0.4mT 50Hz EMF. In addition, an EMF induced autophagy balanced the cellular homeostasis to protect the cells from severe adverse biological consequences.

Abstract: Objective/background
Specific chromosomal translocations are found in human leukemias and lymphomas. These translocations are closely related to particular histological and immunological phenotypes. In Burkitt’s lymphoma, translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32), which involves the c-myc gene (8q24) and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) locus (14q32), accounts for 90–95% of all chromosomal translocations. This translocation can be found in 2–5% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Long-distance polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) assays, which can identify oncogene/Ig gene rearrangement, can detect these fusion genes. The objective of this study was to detect t(8;14) c-myc/IgH gene rearrangement by LD-PCR in patients with DLBCL.
Methods
In this study, 54 DLBCL cases were tested by LD-PCR with specific primers. LD-PCR was used for two breakpoints in both the IgH gene (joining region and γ switch region) and the myc gene (Exons 2 and 3).
Results
As much as 1.85% of the samples were positive for the γ constant region and Exon 2 of the myc gene.
Conclusion
LD-PCR can be used for the detection of t(8;14) c-myc/IgH gene rearrangement in patients with DLBCL.

Abstract: Latent heat storage in molten salt mixtures has been considered as a promising method for medium temperature solar thermal storage and industrial waste heat storage. The binary sodium/lithium nitrate salt mixture is one of the potential candidate materials. However there is limited information on their thermal performance except for their phase diagrams. In this paper, two binary salts, NaNO3–LiNO3 (46–54%) and NaNO3–LiNO3 (40–60%), were investigated to assess their suitability for medium temperature heat storage. The thermal properties and long term stability under multiple cycles of each binary salt pair were investigated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The chemical stability at elevated temperatures was tested using a Thermogravimetric Analyser (TGA). Both binary salts analysed have suitable melting temperatures (just under 200°C) with relatively high latent heat values (>220kJ/kg), both exhibiting good thermal and chemical stability.

Abstract: Objective/background
Thalassemia is a monogenic hematologic disease that has the highest prevalence globally. In addition, there is complexity of the genetic background associated with a variety of phenotypes presented among patients. Genetic heterogeneity related to fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production has been reported as an influencing phenotypic factor of β-thalassemia (β-thal). Therefore, this study aimed to find the effect of these genetic modifiers, especially in the XmnI locus, rs11886868, rs766432 (BCL11A), and rs9399137 (HBS1L-MYB), among β-thal and HbE/β-thal patients in Indonesia, according to laboratory and clinical outcomes, including HbF levels and clinical scores. This study was also designed to compare these modifying effects among β-thal and HbE/β-thal patients in Indonesia.
Methods
A total of 189 patients with genotyping of β-thal and HbE/β-thal were included in this study. The erythrocytes index and Hb electrophoresis measurements were calculated using appropriate methods. The severity of β-thal and HbE/β-thal was classified based on the Mahidol score. Polymorphism of the XmnI locus, rs11886868, rs766432 (BCL11A), and rs9399137 (HBS1L-MYB) was determined using polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) and amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) methods.
Results
The distributions of minor allele in the XmnI locus, rs11886868, rs766432, and rs9399137 were 14%, 22%, 19% and 18% respectively. The variation allele in the XmnI locus, rs11886868, and rs766432 showed a significant value for modifying HbF and clinical score in HbE/β-thal patients, but rs9399137 did not demonstrate such features. In β-thal patients, however, no correlation was found for any single-nucleotide polymorphisms and clinical appearance.
Conclusion
The XmnI locus, rs11886868, and rs766432 have a modifying effect on HbF and clinical score in HbE/β-thal patients in Indonesia, but not in β-thal patients.

Abstract: We tested whether the combined nano-formulation, prepared with curcumin (anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective molecule) and embryonic stem cell exosomes (MESC-exocur), restored neurovascular loss following an ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury in mice. IR-injury was created in 8–10 weeks old mice and divided into two groups. Out of two IR-injured groups, one group received intranasal administration of MESC-exocur for 7days. Similarly, two sham groups were made and one group received MESC-exocur treatment. The study determined that MESC-exocur treatment reduced neurological score, infarct volume and edema following IR-injury. As compared to untreated IR group, MESC-exocur treated-IR group showed reduced inflammation and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor expression. Treatment of MESC-exocur also reduced astrocytic GFAP expression and alleviated the expression of NeuN positive neurons in IR-injured mice. In addition, MESC-exocur treatment restored vascular endothelial tight (claudin-5 and occludin) and adherent (VE-cadherin) junction proteins in IR-injured mice as compared to untreated IR-injured mice. These results suggest that combining the potentials of embryonic stem cell exosomes and curcumin can help neurovascular restoration following ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice.

Abstract: Iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox electrolyte in hybrid electrochromic (EC) devices provides high charge capacity and thereby a high optical modulation can be achieved. However, its corrosive nature and absorption in UV and in blue range of light forming an unpleasant yellowish coloration limits smart window application. In this regard, tetramethylthiourea/tetramethylformaminium disulphide (TMTU/TMFDS2+), 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyl-oxy (TEMPO)/TEMPO+ and potassium ferrocyanide/potassium ferricyanide (K4[Fe(CN)6]/K3[Fe(CN)6]) are studied as alternative redox couples. Their characterisation is performed considering electrochemical and optical properties. The redox potential is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) is determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on sputtered and sol–gel tungsten trioxide (WO3), sol–gel titanium oxide (TiO2), fluorine doped tin oxide (F:SnO2) as well as on sputtered platinum (Pt). TMTU/TMFDS2+ has demonstrated an appropriate redox potential as well as a high charge transfer resistance on oxides and low on Pt layers for high bias potentials. Furthermore, the kinetics of the change in transmission of the EC devices is compared considering the loss current. The EC device comprising TMTU/TMFDS2+ exhibits excellent optical modulation in visual transmission from 71 down to 14% at −795mV within 5min.

Abstract: The relationship between light trapping and microstructure of high-efficiency microcrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on honeycomb textured substrates is investigated by experiments, optical simulations and analytical calculations. The solar cells realized on the honeycomb textured substrates exhibit short circuit current of 30mA/cm2 and energy conversion efficiencies exceeding 11%. The microstructure of the solar cells is limited by the formation of so called “cracks” in the film, which negatively affect the short circuit current, fill factor and open circuit voltage. The formation of cracks is studied by transmission electron microscopy, optoelectrical measurements and simulations of the 3D morphology of the solar cell. Furthermore, a simple analytical model is presented to calculate the critical thickness at which cracks are formed. Both models are compared to experimental results. Guidelines are provided on how to avoid the formation of cracks in microcrystalline silicon films on the textured substrates while maximizing the light trapping properties.

Abstract: Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) belong to the super family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). There are 25 T2Rs expressed in humans, and these interact with a large and diverse group of bitter ligands. T2Rs are expressed in many extra-oral tissues and can perform diverse physiological roles. Structure-function studies led to the identification of similarities and dissimilarities between T2Rs and Class A GPCRs including amino acid conservation and novel motifs. However, the efficacy of most of the T2R ligands is not yet elucidated and the biochemical pharmacology of T2Rs is poorly understood. Recent studies on T2Rs characterized novel ligands including blockers for these receptors that include inverse agonist and antagonists. In this review we discuss the techniques used for elucidating bitter blockers, concept of ligand bias, generic amino acid numbering, the role of cholesterol, and conserved water molecules in the biochemistry and pharmacology of T2Rs.

Abstract: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection presents with a disturbed lipid profile and can evolve to hepatic steatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) is the most abundant transcription factor in the liver, a key regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism and a critical determinant of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition and hepatic development. We have previously shown that transient inhibition of HNF4α initiates transformation of immortalized hepatocytes through a feedback loop consisting of miR-24, IL6 receptor (IL6R), STAT3, miR-124 and miR-629, suggesting a central role of HNF4α in HCC. However, the role of HNF4α in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-related hepatocarcinoma has not been evaluated and remains controversial. In this study, we provide strong evidence suggesting that HCV downregulates HNF4α expression at both transcriptional and translational levels. The observed decrease of HNF4α expression correlated with the downregulation of its downstream targets, HNF1α and MTP. Ectopic overexpression of HCV proteins also exhibited an inhibitory effect on HNF4α levels. The inhibition of HNF4α expression by HCV appeared to be mediated at transcriptional level as HCV proteins suppressed HNF4α gene promoter activity. HCV also up-regulated IL6R, activated STAT3 protein phosphorylation and altered the expression of acute phase genes. Furthermore, as HCV triggered the loss of HNF4α a consequent change of miR-24, miR-629 or miR-124 was observed. Our findings demonstrated that HCV-related HCC could be mediated through HNF4α-microRNA deregulation implying a possible role of HNF4α in HCV hepatocarcinogenesis. HCV inhibition of HNF4α could be sustained to promote HCC.

Abstract: Solar light harvesting nano-heterojunction p-Ag2O/n-TiO2 nanotube catalysts were successfully synthesized by a combination of hydrothermal and wet impregnation methods. The crystal structure and surface morphology analysis revealed that n-TiO2 composed of biphasic anatase-rutile with nano-tubular morphology. The X-ray photoelectron spectrum confirmed the presence of Ti4+ and Ag+ in the form of TiO2 and Ag2O, the results are in good agreement with TEM images. Moreover, DRS UV-Vis spectra and photocurrent density measurements indicated that Ag2O/TiO2 nanotubes have shown strong absorption in visible region and improved current production that indicates the hetero-junction properties. The Ag2O loaded (0.5–2.0wt%) TiO2 nanotubes showed 26 folds enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production in glycerol/water mixture than the standard TiO2 P-25 under solar light irradiation. Interestingly, the catalytic recyclability tests carried out in pure water and glycerol/water mixture exhibited similar rate of H2 production without significant loss in catalytic activity. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity conducted in summer season exhibited higher rate of H2 production than the experiments conducted during winter season owing to the variation in solar flux. The high rate of H2 production can be attributed to the synergistic functions of 1-D nano-tubular morphology, hetero-junction formed between biphasic TiO2 photocatalyst and visible light active Ag2O as sensitizer. Based on the experimental results, a possible electron-hole transfer mechanism was also proposed.

Abstract: Perovskite (PS) solar cells have emerged as a promising technology for low-cost and efficient photovoltaics. However, the main limiting factors are related to their low long-term stability. The loss of performance of these devices is commonly attributed to degradation of the PS itself. In order to further explore the origins of such limited stability, we have developed UV–vis spectroscopy studies that clearly demonstrate that PS layers remain unalterable under the working conditions. On the contrary, significant variations in the absorption spectra of the Spiro-OMeTAD layer (Spiro), a commonly used hole transporting material (HTM), indicate that the loss of performance over the irradiation time are attributed to the degradation of Spiro. UV–vis measurements evidence a photo-induced oxidation of Spiro, both under air and inert atmosphere. This photo-oxidation is accelerated by the commonly employed additives of the Spiro (LiTFSI and tBP), as well as by the interfacial contact with the electron injecting layer (TiO2). Therefore, our results point to the Spiro degradation as the main mechanism that induces the limited functioning of the PS solar cells. Consequently, focusing on the development of alternative HTMs stable under the working conditions is one of the critical issues to be overcome for a suitable progress of PS solar cells and related opto-electronic devices.

Abstract: Cytokine-induced apoptosis inhibitor-1 (CIAPIN-1, formally named anamorsin) is a well-known regulator of apoptosis in many different cell types. Recently, it has been reported that some anti-apoptotic proteins are involved with the regulation of cell differentiation. However, relatively little is known about the role of CIAPIN-1 on rabbit articular chondrocytes differentiation. In this study, we investigated the effects of CIAPIN-1 in chondrocytes, focusing on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 and p38 kinase signaling. CIAPIN-1 caused dedifferentiation, as determined by the inhibition of type II collagen expression and sulfated-proteoglycan synthesis. CIAPIN-1 activated ERK-1/2 and inactivated p38 kinase, as determined by the phosphorylation level of each protein. CIAPIN-1-induced ERK phosphorylation was abolished by the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, which also prevented the CIAPIN-1-induced loss of type II collagen expression. Inhibition of p38 kinase with SB203580 enhanced the decrease in type II collagen expression. Our findings collectively suggest that ERK-1/2 and p38 kinase regulate CIAPIN-1-induced dedifferentiation in rabbit articular chondrocytes.

Abstract: We present a novel passivating contact structure based on a nanostructured silicon-based layer. Traditional poly-Si junctions feature excellent junction characteristics but their optical absorption induces current losses when applied to the solar cell front side. Targeting enhanced transparency, the poly-Si layer is replaced with a mixed-phase silicon oxide/silicon layer. This mixed-phase layer consists of an amorphous SiOx matrix with incorporated Si filaments connecting one side of the layer to the other, and is referred to as nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOx) layer. We investigate passivation quality, measured as saturation current density, and nanostructural changes, characterized by Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, carefully studying the influence of annealing dwell temperature. Excellent surface passivation on n-type and also p-type wafers is shown. An optimum annealing temperature of 950°C is found, resulting in a saturation current density of 8.8fAcm−2 and 11.0fAcm−2 for n-type and p-type wafers, respectively. Even before forming gas annealing, emitter saturation current densities of 27.9 fA cm−2 (n+/n junction) and 32.0 fA cm−2 (n+/p junction) are reached. Efficient current extraction is presented with specific contact resistivities of 86mΩcm2 on n-type wafer and 19mΩcm2 on p-type wafers, respectively. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that the layer stack consists of intermixed SiOx and Si phases with the Si phases being partly crystalline already in the as-deposited state. Thermal annealing at temperatures ≥850°C further promotes crystallization of the Si-rich regions. The addition of the SiOx phase enhances the thermal stability of the contact and should allow to tune the refractive index and improve transparency, while still providing efficient electrical transport through the crystalline Si phase, which extends throughout almost the entire contact.

Abstract: A high-efficiency front junction n-type passivated emitter and a rear total diffusion (n-type PERT) solar cell with the front boron diffusion passivated by a Al2O3/SiNx stack layer deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor method and the rear with phosphorus total diffusion and Al evaporated local contact are presented in this paper. The main purpose of this study was to develop industrially feasible front junction n-type PERT solar cells with high-efficiency; these were realized on a large area of n-type industrial 5- and 6-in. wafers. An average of 21.85% cell efficiency was achieved on 5-in. wafers, and the highest cell convert efficiency of 21.98% was achieved with Voc of 683.8mV, Jsc of 40.13mA/cm2, and FF of 80.11%. For 6-in. cells, we get Fraunhofer independently confirmed efficiency of 21.49% with a Voc of 674.1mV, a Jsc of 39.77mA/cm2, a FF of 80.18%. Details of cell fabrication and results are presented, followed by a best cell power loss analysis on Voc, Isc and FF.

Abstract: A series of Cu doped titania, CuxTi1−xO2−δ (x=0.0, 0.02, 0.06) and copper oxide-titanium oxide nanocomposites, xCuO-yTiO2 (x:y=1:9, 2:8, 5:5) were synthesized by sol-gel method and characterized by relevant techniques. The role of Cu ions in enhancement of photocatalytic evolution of H2 from H2O-methanol/glycerol mixtures in both sunlight and UV–visible irradiation over Cu/Ti oxides was investigated. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), supported by X-ray diffraction and Raman studies, revealed that Cu substitution in TiO2 stabilized anatase lattice, lengthened Ti-O bonds, decreased the coordination number around Cu ions, and induced oxygen ion vacancies and distortion (σ) in lattice. Distorted structures are more open and flexible with improved charge carrier dynamics and favourable photocatalytic properties. Nanosized Cu-Ti-O powders with enhanced N2-BET surface area and microporosity exhibited improved photocatalytic properties. Reduction of CuO to photocatalytically more active Cu2O by photo-generated e- on the surface of composites was evident by the absence of Cu2+ peak in the XPS spectra of the composite sample after exposure to light. The most active formulations for sunlight assisted photocatalytic H2 generation were Cu0.02Ti0.98O2 for the doped samples, referred to as CuTi(2), and xCuO-yTiO2(x:y=2:8) for the composite samples. Performance of the most active, CuTi(2), was monitored in a up-scaled photoreactor in order to investigate the influence of illumination area, catalyst concentration, form of catalyst (powder/films) and different sacrificial agents on H2 yield. With an aim to identify practical materials for pilot plants, 6mg of CuTi(2) was dispersed on (30cm×0.7cm) ITO/PET films that exhibited enhanced efficiency (3.06%) as compared to same amount of CuTi(2) powder (1.41%). The results showed that the utilization of the CuTi(2) photocatalyst (without costly cocatalysts) with the proper selection of optimum operational conditions under sunlight in a up-scaled photoreactor, generated H2 yield of 1.167L/h/m2 with apparent quantum efficiency, AQE, of 7.5% and solar to fuel efficiency, SFE, of 3.9% for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our results suggest that with this efficiency, H2 at 1L/h would be evolved photocatalytically over 0.9m2 of CuTi(2) photocatalyst, exposed to sunlight. Inputs obtained from the present study will be useful for further scale up of sunlight driven photocatalytic hydrogen production over low cost and efficient Cu modified TiO2.

Abstract: Organic solar cells (OSC) based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) small molecule have achieved relatively high efficiency (7%) in recent times. 2,5-di(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-bis-(5″-n-hexyl-[2,2′,5′,2″]terthiophen-5-yl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (SMDPPEH) is the workhorse material for small molecule OSC as it has good solution-processing capability. However, there was no previous report on improving the device stability in inverted organic solar cells (IOSC) by using this material. Furthermore, the degradation and light-soaking behavior of this material in IOSC are also not well-addressed. In this work, we have fabricated a stable, light-soaking free, solution-processed and efficient SMDPPEH:PC61BM based IOSC for the first time. Fluorosurfactant modified PEDOT:PSS and fluorinated TiOx (F-TiOx) transport layers were used to circumvent the inherent processability and light-soaking issues. An exclusive study on the device stability and light-soaking characteristics were also carried out for the first time. The final device provides the following merits: (i) comparable material stability to P3HT polymer, suggesting a potential for further development of DPP materials for high-efficiency devices; (ii) F-TiOx can be used universally to fabricate a light-soaking free device with a wide range of photoactive materials from polymers to small molecules and; (iii) higher device efficiency compared to the non-inverted counterpart were obtained when the modified transport layers were used.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by brain plaques of amyloid beta and by neuronal loss, but it is unclear how amyloid beta causes neuronal loss and how to prevent this loss. We have previously shown that amyloid beta causes neuronal loss by inducing microglia to phagocytose neurons, and here we investigated whether protein kinase Cs and NADPH oxidase were involved in this. The loss of neurons induced by amyloid beta in co-cultures of primary glia and neurons was completely prevented by inhibiting protein kinase Cs with Gö6976 or Gö6983. Directly activating protein kinase Cs with phorbol myristate acetate stimulated microglial phagocytosis, and induced neuronal loss mediated by MFG-E8/vitronectin receptor pathway of microglial phagocytosis. Blocking phagocytosis by MFG-E8 knockout or receptor inhibition left live neurons, indicating microglial phagocytosis was the cause of neuronal death. Phorbol myristate acetate stimulated the microglial NADPH oxidase, and inhibiting the oxidase prevented neuronal loss. A physiological activator of NADPH oxidase, fMLP, also induced neuronal loss dependent on microglia. Amyloid beta-induced neuronal loss was blocked by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, superoxide dismutase or Toll-like receptor function-blocking antibodies. The results indicate that amyloid beta induces microglial phagocytosis of neurons via activating protein kinase Cs and NADPH oxidase, and that activating the kinases or oxidase is sufficient to induce neuronal loss by microglial phagocytosis. Thus inhibiting protein kinase Cs or NADPH oxidase might be beneficial in Alzheimer’s disease or other brain pathologies involving inflammatory neuronal loss mediated by microglia.

Abstract: This paper studies the behaviour of austenitic steel HR3C in a eutectic ternary Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 molten salt mixture through an isothermal immersion test at 700°C for 2000h. To this aim various techniques were used in order to examine the effects of long-term, high-temperature corrosion processes on the selected substrate. It was found that the corrosion products were arranged in a multilayer structure, with LiFeO2, LiCrO2, NiO and FeCr2O4 being the main compounds in the different layers. The composition of the remaining salt after the corrosion tests was also studied, the chromium increase being one of the main points to highlight. The results suggested that longer immersion tests should be carried out to clearly confirm the suitability of HR3C for solar thermal applications.

Abstract: Mitochondrial Targeting Sequences (MTSs) are responsible for trafficking nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria. Once entering the mitochondria, the MTS is recognized and cleaved off. Some MTSs are long and undergo two-step processing, as in the case of the human frataxin (FXN) protein (80aa), implicated in Friedreich's ataxia (FA). Therefore, we chose the FXN protein to examine whether nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins can efficiently be targeted via a heterologous MTS (hMTS) and deliver a functional protein into mitochondria. We examined three hMTSs; that of citrate synthase (cs), lipoamide deydrogenase (LAD) and C6ORF66 (ORF), as classically MTS sequences, known to be removed by one-step processing, to deliver FXN into mitochondria, in the form of fusion proteins. We demonstrate that using hMTSs for delivering FXN results in the production of 4–5-fold larger amounts of the fusion proteins, and at 4–5-fold higher concentrations. Moreover, hMTSs delivered a functional FXN protein into the mitochondria even more efficiently than the native MTSfxn, as evidenced by the rescue of FA patients’ cells from oxidative stress; demonstrating a 18%–54% increase in cell survival; and a 13%-33% increase in ATP levels, as compared to the fusion protein carrying the native MTS. One fusion protein with MTScs increased aconitase activity within patients’ cells, by 400-fold. The implications form our studies are of vast importance for both basic and translational research of mitochondrial proteins as any mitochondrial protein can be delivered efficiently by an hMTS. Moreover, effective targeting of functional proteins is important for restoration of mitochondrial function and treatment of related disorders.

Abstract: ZnO@TiO2 core–shell nanostructures have been manipulated with metal ion dopants to create DSSC photoanodes with reduced charge transfer recombination. ZnO and TiO2 were modified by doping with Cd and Mg, respectively, resulting in a reduction in the band-gap for Cd:ZnO and an increase in the band-gap for Mg:TiO2. A series of core–shell nanostructures based on a ZnO or a Cd:ZnO core and TiO2 or a Mg:TiO2 shell have been investigated as DSSC photoanodes. In another series, the core–shell materials were reversed for complete evaluation of our hypothesis. The structures of the core–shell nanoparticles, optoelectronic and interfacial charge transfer of the DSSCs were analyzed by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, Mott-Schottky experiment, UV–vis DRS, J–V and EIS measurements. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of DSSCs based on these core–shell structures were observed to depend on the flat band of the shell oxide relative to that of the core oxide. DSSCs with Cd:ZnO@Mg:TiO2 and Cd:ZnO@TiO2 photoanodes achieved Voc and FF values comparable to those of DSSCs with TiO2 anodes. A moderate energy gradient and high potential barrier in these core–shell structures resulted in longer effective electron lifetimes and lower electron recombination in the corresponding DSSCs. The low PCE registered for DSSCs with anodes of Cd:ZnO@Mg:TiO2 and Cd:ZnO@TiO2 were attributed to the presence of a high proportion of rutile phase, caused by sintering at 650°C and lower dye adsorption as a result larger particle sizes caused by Cd doping.

Abstract: Myriad forms of endogenous and environmental stress disrupt mitochondrial function by impacting critical processes in mitochondrial homeostasis, such as mitochondrial redox system, oxidative phosphorylation, biogenesis, and mitophagy. External stressors that interfere with the steady state activity of mitochondrial functions are generally associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species, inflammatory response, and induction of cellular senescence (inflammaging) potentially via mitochondrial damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPS). Many of these are the key events in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its exacerbations. In this review, we highlight the primary mitochondrial quality control mechanisms that are influenced by oxidative stress/redox system, including role of mitochondria during inflammation and cellular senescence, and how mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD and its exacerbations via pathogenic stimuli.

Abstract: TGF-β1 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and autophagy in a variety of cells. However, the role of autophagy in TGF-β1-induced EMT has not been clearly elucidated and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, we found that TGF-β1 induced both autophagy and EMT in mouse tubular epithelial C1.1 cells. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine or siRNA knockdown of Beclin 1 reduced TGF-β1-induced increase of vimentin and decreased E-cadherin expression. In contrast, rapamycin-associated enhancement of TGF-β1-induced autophagy increased EMT of C1.1 cells. Serum rescue inhibited autophagy followed by reversal of EMT. Blocking of autophagosome-lysosomal but not proteosomal degradation reduced the decrease of E-cadherin, demonstrating a role for autophagy in degradation of E-cadherin during EMT. Autophagy promoted the activation of Src and Src-associated phosphorylation of β-catenin at Y-654 leading to pY654-β-catenin/p-Smad2 complex formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated binding by the pY654-β-catenin/p-Smad2 complex to ILK promoter thus increasing ILK expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TGF-β1-induced autophagy links β-catenin and Smad signaling to promote EMT in C1.1 cells through a novel pY654-β-catenin/p-Smad2/ILK pathway. The pathway delineated links disruption of E-cadherin/β-catenin-mediated cell–cell contact to induction of EMT via upregulation of ILK.

Abstract: Successful fabrication and operation of highly stable organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells demand improved durability of the semiconductor materials used in the active layer. In this study, we performed photooxidation studies on DTS(FBTTh2)2:fullerene bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) films, one of the promising small-molecule materials for OPV cells, by using two-dimensional (2D) grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), absorption spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of 2D-GIWAXS and absorption spectroscopic analyses indicate that increasing the crystallinity of DTS(FBTTh2)2:fullerene BHJ films improved their photostability. The AFM results suggest that the roughness of the original DTS(FBTTh2)2:fullerene films was also related to their photooxidation rates. The results obtained in this work show that changing the fullerene derivative species and controlling the nanostructures of the thin films are both important criteria for improving the photostability of OPV cells.

Abstract: This paper reports on the fabrication of ZnO nanowalls for use as an electron collecting layer (ECL) in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Two-dimension ZnO nanowalls were grown using a low-temperature chemical bath method with a thin Al film as a seed layer. We compared electron collecting layers based on nanowalls and sol–gel derived ZnO thin film in PSCs and sought to identify the mechanism underlying the collection of electrons. The proposed ZnO nanowalls achieved a fill factor significantly higher than that of ZnO thin films, which translated into a remarkable improvement in power conversion efficiency, reaching 13.6% under AM 1.5G illumination.

Abstract: Suppressor of variegation 3⿿9 homolog 1 (Suv39h1) is a histone methyltransferase that trimethylates lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3), which results in gene silencing. A previous study found that H3K9me3 and Suv39h1 were decreased in diabetic mouse vascular smooth muscle cells whereas Suv39h1 overexpression attenuated ischemic myocardial injury. Moreover, high glucose (HG) decreased H3K9me3 and Suv39h1 levels in some cells. Thus, we studied the roles of Suv39h1 in HG-induced effects in MES13 (mouse mesangial) cells. We found that HG, chaetocin (a Suv39h1 inhibitor) and Suv39h1 siRNA decreased Suv39h1 while increasing fibronectin and p21WAF1 protein levels. HG increased mRNA while chaetocin increased transcription of fibronectin and p21WAF1genes. Both HG and chaetocin decreased histone H3K9me3 levels at the promoters of fibronectin and p21WAF1 genes. Additionally, Suv39h1 overexpression attenuated HG-induced fibronectin and p21WAF1 mRNA and protein expressions while attenuating HG-induced cell hypertrophy. Suv39h1 overexpression also attenuated HG-suppressed histone H3K9me3 levels at the promoters of fibronectin and p21WAF1 genes. Moreover, LY294002 or the dominant-negative phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) mutant (οp85) attenuated HG-decreased Suv39h1 and HG-induced fibronectin and p21WAF1 protein expressions. We concluded that HG decreased Suv39h1 via the PI3K pathway in mesangial cells. Inhibition of Suv39h1 increased fibronectin and p21WAF1 expressions. Moreover, Suv39h1 overexpression attenuated HG-induced fibronectin and p21WAF1 expressions and cell hypertrophy while attenuating HG-suppressed histone H3K9me3 levels at the promoters of fibronectin and p21WAF1 genes.

Abstract: Long-term stability is a major issue preventing dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) market implementation. The DSC stability problem relates to the sealing methods which usually employ thermoplastic sealants. This communication shows for the first time that laser glass sealing originates stable and efficient DSCs. Laser sealed DSCs showed remarkable stability compared to the Surlyn® sealed devices (ca. 2% vs. 44%) after accelerated ageing during 1000h, at 65°C, light intensity of 765Wm−2 and resistive electrical load (~0.6V). These results show that efficient encapsulation methods are crucial to DSC stability and that the developed sealing process can bring stable and efficient DSCs to the photovoltaic market.

Abstract: Photoelectrochemical properties of conformal photocathodes based on chalcopyrite built-in on flexible stainless steel foils are shown to give current density level higher than 30mAcm−2 (0VRHE). These conformal photocathodes can become elements for developing new concepts for PEC cells to obtain solar fuels. The influence on the PEC characteristics of the protective anticorrosion layer based on TiO2 film deposited by atomic layer deposition technique at very low temperature, 200°C, and using TiCl4 precursor are analyzed and discussed particularly taking into account the charge transport mechanisms through this layer. Likewise, buffer layer between the used n-type layer and the protective one such as i-ZnO and AZO layers have also been considered to facilitate high efficient photocathode design adaptable for new solar refinery applications for water splitting or CO2 photoreduction. Improved photocurrent values are obtained with TiO2 protective values of 100nm.

Abstract: Candida albicans is a common yeast that resides in the human body, but can occasionally cause systemic fungal infection, namely candidiasis. As this infection rate is gradually increasing, it is becoming a major problem to public health. Accordingly, we for the first time investigated the antifungal activity and mode of action of silibinin, a natural product extracted from Silybum marianum (milk thistle), against C. albicans. On treatment with 100μM silibinin, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from mitochondria, which can cause yeast apoptosis via oxidative stress, was increased by 24.17% compared to that in untreated cells. Subsequently, we found disturbances in ion homeostasis such as release of intracellular K+ and accumulation of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca2+. Among these phenomena, mitochondrial Ca2+ overload particularly plays a crucial role in the process of apoptosis, promoting the activation of pro-apoptotic factors. Therefore, we investigated the significance of mitochondrial Ca2+ in apoptosis by employing 20mM ruthenium red (RR). Additional apoptosis hallmarks such as mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release, caspase activation, phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, and DNA damage were observed in response to silibinin treatment, whereas RR pre-treatment seemed to block these responses. In summary, our results suggest that silibinin induces yeast apoptosis mediated by mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling in C. albicans.

Abstract: The material that is used in solar receivers is subjected to intense cyclic thermal stresses and extreme temperatures, which are directly dependent on the intermittence of the solar resource. These factors accelerate the ageing mechanisms and reduce the durability of the receivers because of a reduction of their thermal performance. This study presents guidelines to study the thermo-radiative properties of an absorber material that is subjected to a highly concentrated solar flux. The material was a square honeycomb SiCSi structure that is typically used in volumetric air receivers. Accelerated ageing tests were performed by means of crashing thermal treatments, in which the modulus and period of the incident flux and the boundary conditions of the material were varied. The reflectivity and absorptivity of the material were experimentally characterized before and after the thermal treatments. The measurements were performed using two different reflectometers, one monochromatic and one in the solar band; the latter can measure at ambient temperature or high temperature that is representative of the operational conditions (400–700°C). However, only the solar band reflectometer working at high temperature was able to detect the evolution of the thermo-radiative properties of the material, which highlights the important role of the temperature and the wavelength. Furthermore, the thermal treatments in which the samples were water-cooled and in which the solar flux was medial more quickly accelerated the ageing mechanism of the material and reduced its absorptivity.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50), a pro-oncogene overexpressed in many types of tumors, could promote cell proliferation, invasion, tumorigenesis, and tumor metastasis, suggesting that it is a potential cancer therapeutic target in drug discovery. Here, a luciferase assay system driven by the TSP50 gene promoter was used to screen the inhibitor of expression of TSP50. The study found that cardamonin, a flavone compound, could efficiently inhibit the expression of TSP50 in both mRNA and protein levels. Further results revealed that cardamonin also efficiently inhibited the viability of TSP50 high-expressing cancer cells by inducing G2/M-phase arrest and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Surprisingly, knocking down the expression of TSP50 gene had the same effects as treatment with cardamonin. Moreover, it has been found that cardamonin had an inhibitory potency on TSP50 high-expressing tumor growth in vivo. In contrast, overexpression of TSP50 greatly decreased the cell sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of cardamonin and reversed the decreased tumor-inhibitory effect of cardamonin. Additionally, both TSP50 interference and treatment with cardamonin could suppress p65 nuclear translocation, and overexpression of TSP50 reversed the suppressive effect of cardamonin on p65 nuclear translocation. Taken together, these results suggest that cardamonin inhibited cell viability and tumorigenesis at least partially via blocking the activation of TSP50-mediated nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway, and cardamonin may be a promising anticancer drug candidate in the development of a novel agent for TSP50 high-expressing cancer cells.

Abstract: The present article studies the binary mixture comprised by erythritol and urea for its application as a phase change material (PCM) in latent hat thermal energy storage systems for heating and domestic hot water applications. A sequential methodology was employed to evaluate the suitability of the mixture as a PCM. First, a preliminary evaluation was performed by means of the modeling of the phase diagram and by hot–stage microscopy. Afterwards, the results were refined with more precise techniques, such as Differential scanning calorimetry, the synthetic visual method and X-ray diffraction. The results showed a eutectic composition formed by 54.9% (w/w) erythritol and 45.1% (w/w) urea, with a melting temperature of 81.13°C and a latent melting enthalpy of 248J/g. The specific weight of the eutectic composition was measured at different temperatures. The density of the liquid PCM at 95°C presented a value of 1.282g/cm3 and thus, the proposed eutectic mixture shows a volumetric storage capacity of 318MJ/m3. These properties are suitable for the applications aimed. The current market price of the mixture is nearby 2.5€/kg, which can be regarded as reasonable. Since urea undergoes thermal degradation upon heating, a preliminary accelerated thermal cycling test was performed. After 85 thermal cycles, the enthalpy of the eutectic mixture was reduced by 3.6%. In contrast, pure urea showed a decrease of 75% of its initial storage ability. According to the results, the eutectic mixture formed by erythritol and urea can be a good candidate for use as a PCM in medium temperature range applications. Further research is required to evaluate the stability of the mixture on longer periods of use. The methodology employed has proven to be adequate for the development of new eutectic PCMs.

USP7 promotes cell proliferation through the stabilization of Ki-67 protein in non-small cell lung cancer cells,

Abstract: The Ki-67 antigen (Ki-67) is the most reliable immunohistochemical marker for evaluation of cell proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of protein levels of Ki-67 in non-small cell lung cancer have remained elusive. In this study, we found that Ki-67 and ubiquitin-specific processing protease 7 (USP7) protein were highly expressed in the nucleus of non-small cell lung cancer cells. Furthermore, statistical analysis uncovered the existence of a strong correlation between Ki-67 and USP7 levels. We could also show that the protein levels of Ki-67 in non-small cell lung cancer cells significantly decreased after treatment with P22077, a selective chemical inhibitor of USP7, while the Ki-67 mRNA levels were unperturbed. Similar results were obtained by knocking down USP7 using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in lung cancer cells. Interestingly, we noticed that ubiquitination levels of Ki-67 increased dramatically in USP7-silenced cells. The tests in vitro and vivo showed a significant delay in tumor cell growth upon knockdown of USP7. Additionally, drug sensitivity tests indicated that USP7-silenced A549 cells had enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel and docetaxel, while there was no significant change in sensitivity toward carboplatin and cisplatin. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the overexpression of USP7 might promote cell proliferation by deubiquitinating Ki-67 protein, thereby maintaining its high levels in the non-small cell lung cancer. Our study also hints potential for the development of deubiquitinase-based therapies, especially those targeting USP7 to improve the condition of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer.

Abstract: Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive correlation between daily increases in airborne particulate matter (PM) concentration and the occurrence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Transition metals present in air PM were associated with adverse health effects after PM exposure. The aim of this work was to study lung O2 metabolism after an acute exposure to transition metal-coated nanoparticles (NPs). Female Swiss mice (25g) were intranasally instilled with a suspension of silica NP containing Ni (II), Cd (II), Fe (III), or Cr (VI) at 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 1.0mg metal/kg body weight. Lung O2 consumption was found to be significantly increased after the exposure to most doses of Ni-NP and Fe-NP, and the 0.05mg metal/kg body weight dose of Cr-NP, while no changes were observed for Cd-NP. Lucigenin chemiluminescence (as an indicator of NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity) was evaluated in lung homogenates. Only Ni-NP and Fe-NP have shown the ability to induce a significant increase in lucigenin chemiluminescence. In order to establish the possible occurrence of pulmonary oxidative stress, TBARS levels and the GSH/GSSG ratio were determined. The higher doses of Ni-NP and Fe-NP were able to induce an oxidative stress condition, as shown by changes in both TBARS levels and the GSH/GSSG ratio. Taken together, the present results show differential effects for all the metals tested. These findings emphasize the importance of transition metals present air PM in PM adverse health effects, and contribute to the understanding of the pathological mechanisms triggered by the exposure to environmental PM.

Abstract: Hemorrhagic cystitis is one of the devastating complications seen after receiving cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. Oleuropein is the most important phenolic compound of olive leaves that mediates most of its beneficial pharmacological properties. Herein, we investigated the possible uroprotective effect of oleuropein against cyclophosphamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis in a rat model. For this purpose, we measured bladder nitric oxide, reduced glutathione, catalase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor levels in addition to the bladder gene expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 after induction of hemorrhagic cystitis in the presence or absence of oleuropein. Histopathological examination of bladder tissues was also performed. After cyclophosphamide injection, we demonstrated a significant decrease in bladder reduced glutathione (39%) and catalase (55.4%) levels and a significant increase of nitric oxide (5.6 folds), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (3.3 folds), vascular endothelial growth factor (2 folds) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (8 folds) bladder contents when compared to those in normal control rats. Administration of oleuropein induced a marked elevation in bladder reduced glutathione (37.8%), catalase (100.4%) with a prominent reduction of bladder nitric oxide (40%), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (35.9%) and vascular endothelial growth factor (56.2%) levels along with downregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 bladder expression (73.1%) in comparison to cyclophosphamide treated rats levels. Our data demonstrated that oleuropein counteracts the harmful effects of cyclophosphamide on the bladder through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Oleuropein exerts a definite uroprotective effect against cyclophosphamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis in rats.

Abstract: Castable cements on metals form a protective barrier that is able to prevent permeation of molten salts towards metallic surfaces. Silica-based castable cements are capable of protecting containment metallic alloys from the corrosive attack of molten chlorides at temperatures as high as 650°C. Boron nitride (BN) blocking the pores in the cured cement prevents permeation of the molten chloride towards the metal surface. The cements tested are not chemically stable in molten carbonates, because the bonding components dissolved into molten carbonates salt. The corrosion rate is 7.72±0.32mm/year for bare stainless steel 347 in molten eutectic NaCl – 65.58wt% LiCl at 650°C, which is the baseline used for determining how well the cement protects the metallic surfaces from corrosion. In particular the metal fully encapsulated with Aremco 645-N with pores filled with boron nitride immersed in molten eutectic NaCl – 65.58wt% LiCl at 650°C shows a corrosion rate of 9E-04mm/year. The present study gives initial corrosion rates. Long-term tests are required to determine if Aremco 645-N with BN coating on metal has long term chemical stability for blocking salt permeation through coating pores.

Abstract: By dipping the mesoporous TiO2 film in Sr2+ solutions and subsequent annealing, a modification layer of SrTiO3 has been formed on the surface of the mesoporous TiO2 film, and the effect of modification on the photovoltaic characteristics of the perovskite solar cells has been studied detailedly. The XPS and TEM results verified the existence and nature of the SrTiO3 modification layer. Benifiting from the TiO2 surface modification, the morphology of perovskite film and light absorption of the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber have been improved effectively, and a faster charge transfer has also been achieved between the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer and the modified TiO2. As a result, an average conversion efficiency of 11.4% has been achieved in the perovskite solar cell based on the modified mesoporous TiO2 by 10mM Sr2+ solution, and it increases approximately by 46% in comparison with the photovoltaic efficiency of 7.8% of the perovskite solar cell based the bare mesoporous TiO2 layer.

Abstract: In this study, a multilayer thin film of ITO/VO2/TiO2 was investigated for simultaneous control of the solar and thermal spectra with potential application as an energy-efficient coating for windows in built environments. The functions for these layers were: low emissivity, thermochromism, and anti-reflectance in the visible region. Films were deposited using reactive magnetron sputtering and characterized with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that relatively high luminous transmittance, low emissivity, and favorable thermochromism can be achieved for a film with a transition temperature centered at 52°C with a hysteresis width of 18°C. This shows that an advancement of the previous state of the art can be made by restricting the Scherrer grain size of the VO2 layer to 92nm.

Abstract: The electrical role of the highly resistive and transparent (HRT) i-ZnO layer in Cu(In, Ga)Se2(CIGS) solar cells is investigated. By tuning the resistivity of atomic layer deposited (ALD) i-ZnO through the use of post-growth O2-plasma treatments, it is shown that low i-ZnO carrier densities (i.e. high resistivities) actually restrict the performance of CIGS solar cells by reducing the extent of band-bending of the CdS/CIGS junction (the effect of series resistance is ruled out as the origin of any observed differences). This is the first evidence that i-ZnO has a negative electrical effect in CIGS solar cells (alongside the positive effect of shunt mitigation), and based on these results, attempts to maximise resistivity of the i-ZnO (typically sought-after for this HRT layer) are not recommended. Device efficiencies of 12.5% were obtained when using low resistivity as-grown ALD i-ZnO (resistivity, ρ=0.6Ωcm, carrier density, n=3.5·1018cm−3, and work function, Φ=4.06eV), but this decreased to 11.5% when using high resistivity, plasma-treated ALD i-ZnO (ρ=134Ωcm, n=0.2·1018cm−3, and Φ=4.21eV). SCAPS modelling revealed the reason for the difference to be the effect that the i-ZnO work function (controlled by carrier density) has on the band-bending and built-in voltage, Vbi, of the main junction. Capacitance-voltage experiments confirmed that the Vbi is lower (∆Vbi~0.1V) when using low carrier density, high resistivity i-ZnO. This general effect was also found when using RF-sputtered i-ZnO, whereby the inclusion of high resistivity i-ZnO similarly generated lower efficiencies (15.0%) than low resistivity i-ZnO (15.9%).

Abstract: A systematic investigation of the electronic structure of the CdS buffer layer of CIGS solar cells has been undertaken using S K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), both experimentally and theoretically. We found from XAS that growing CdS films by chemical bath deposition (CBD) exhibits more long-range disorder when compared to single crystal CdS, CdS grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and theory. We investigated the significance of a variety of point defects and potential atomic substitutions in first-principles estimates of the differential S K-edge XAS sensitivity. We find that substituting some sulfur atoms with e.g. oxygen or selenium does not introduce significant changes to the partial S(3p) density of states of the conduction band in CdS and we infer that the electronic structure modifications of these defects are spatially localized and do not hybridize strongly with bands with significant sulfur p character. Moreover, by comparison with experimental XAS should be sensitive to CdSO4; however this is not in the CdS layers of CIGS devices studied here. We also find that the CBD of CdS on FTO-glass and separately on CIGS does not produce any significant changes in the local atomic structure of CdS indicating no CIGS-influenced growth.

Abstract: We report on the development of WO3 layers with increased symmetry induced by the incorporation of titanium into a crystalline WO3 matrix. The atomic ratio between W and Ti was varied stepwise from 100:1 to 100:20 with pure WO3 layers, made using peroxo sol–gel synthesis, as a reference. Layers were then formed by dip-coating from the corresponding sols. IR spectroscopy and XRD analysis of layers and powders heat-treated at 450°C proved that the presence of titanium ions induces ordering and increases the symmetry of WO6 octahedra in the WO3 crystalline matrix leading to the transformation of the cell symmetry from monoclinic through tetragonal up to the cubic. Cyclic voltammetry confirmed that this increased symmetry leads to an up-shift in redox potential, which favors the coloration of the layers in photochromic devices. According to our knowledge, this is the first report of colorless cubic WO3 layers, which have potential applications in optoelectronic devices and sensors.

Abstract: Molten salt is considered to be part of the main direction for studying high temperature heat transfer and storage medium in concentrated solar power due to its good thermo physical properties. Specific heat capacity performs a significant role in increasing the overall cycle efficiency and reducing the cost of heat transfer and storage. In this paper, in order to enhance the specific heat capacity, 1wt% SiO2 nanoparticles are added into a quaternary nitrate (Ca(NO3)2-KNO3-NaNO3-LiNO3 with a low melting point called the low melting point salt (LMPS), which are mixed through ultra-sonication. Experimental results show that the specific heat capacity can be enhanced when nanoparticles are evenly distributed in the quaternary nitrate. The optimal ultra-sonication time with a frequency of 45kHz is researched. The average specific heat capacity of nano-LMPS can reach up to 1.87J/(gK) and the average enhancement reaches 19.4%. There is a good linear relationship between the specific heat capacity of nano-LMPS and ultra-sonication time. Scanning electron microgram images reveal that lamellar networks with higher density phase on the solid nano-LMPS surface exist and may cause the specific heat capacity enhancement of nano-LMPS.

Abstract: Thin film solar cells, and in particular printed organic solar cells, offer a potential route to a low cost power generation from sunlight. However, manufacturing these solar cells rapidly generates large areas that have to be characterized, preferably in-line for a direct feed back to the development and production process. Here we introduce the LEDimage, a LED array illumination induced photocurrent method suitable for high speed in-line characterization and defect detection of organic solar cell modules. Each LED in the array is amplitude modulated at an individual frequency and photo current maps are generated by analyzing the photo current response with a multifrequency lock-in amplifier. For monolithic series connected modules the LEDimage enables simultaneous illumination of all series connected subcells without additional bias light. Furthermore, the LEDimage can be used as a hand scanner for fast device characterization and also as a portable photocurrent mapping tool. Upscaled and with improved in-line contacts we expect that LEDimage can be an effective research and industry tool for characterization of large area thin film solar cells at high speeds.

Abstract: The range of applications for kesterite photovoltaic devices can be widely broadened by the use of alternatives to the commonly used soda-lime glass (SLG) as substrate. This work explores the possibility to use commercial ceramic tiles as ecological substrates for Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin film solar cells in view of an application in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). As a novel approach to control the Na-incorporation into the kesterite absorber, the substrates are coated with enamels containing different concentrations of Na2O (from 2 to 20% wt.). This way, the enamel becomes not only a smoothing element but also a source of Na during the absorber growth. The impact that an increased Na2O content has on the Mo back contact deposited on these enameled ceramic substrates is investigated. 3D optical profilometry shows surfaces with undulations, pinholes and cracks directly related to the Na2O content of the enamels. High quality kesterite (Cu2ZnSnSe4) absorbers with good crystallinity were produced on these substrates by sequential precursor sputtering and selenization. The good performance of first solar cell devices with a maximum efficiency of 7.5% gives a solid proof-of-concept for ceramic solar tiles based on efficient kesterite absorbers.

Abstract: Autophagy is emerging as a critical response of normal and cancer cells to environmental changes and plays an important role in cell metabolism and maintenance of damaged organelles. Transmembrane prostate androgen-induced protein (TMEPAI) is a pro-tumorigenic factor with high expression in tumor cells. In this study, we showed that depletion of TMEPAI leads to lysosomal labilization and inhibits autophagy. Further study showed that the inhibition of autophagy induced by the depletion of TMEPAI is involved in regulation of Beclin-1. Depletion of TMEPAI increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Our study reveals the role of TMEPAI in promoting lysosome stability and autophagy, which might be used as a target for cancer chemotherapeutic treatment.

Abstract: Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is a member of the lysyl oxidase family, which plays an important role in extracellular matrix protein biosynthesis and tumor progression. In the present study, we identified a novel splice variant, LOXL2Δ72, which encodes a peptide having the same N- and C-termini as wild-type LOXL2 (LOXL2WT), but lacks 72 nucleotides encoding 24 amino acids. LOXL2Δ72 had dramatically reduced enzymatic activity, and was no longer secreted. However, LOXL2Δ72 promoted greater cell migration and invasion than LOXL2WT. Furthermore, a dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that LOXL2Δ72 activates distinct signal transduction pathways compared to LOXL2WT, consistent with cDNA microarray data showing different expression levels of cell migration- and invasion-related genes induced following over-expression of each LOXL2 isoform. In particular, LOXL2Δ72 distinctly promoted esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell migration via up-regulating the C-C motif chemokine ligand 28 (CCL28). Our results suggest that the new LOXL2 splice variant contributes to tumor progression by novel molecular mechanisms different from LOXL2WT.

Abstract: The time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique offers a high sensitivity to low light intensities and a wide dynamic range from nanoseconds to seconds. In this paper we demonstrate the versatility of TCSPC for purposes of the highly sensitive electric characterisation of silicon, complementing the established analogous PL characterisation metrology. Using TCSPC we show that the charge carrier lifetime in silicon may be determined down to very low injection levels of 106cm−3 with a purely dynamic approach. By observing the decay characteristics of the charge carrier density in Cz silicon in the nanosecond to second time regime we obtain the up to now most unambiguous support for the existence of two deep electron trap levels located in the band gap of silicon.

Abstract: Ubiquitin-specific protease 14, a deubiquitinating enzyme, has been implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of several cancers, but its role in oral squamous cell carcinoma remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the expression pattern and roles of Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 in the occurrence and development of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Interestingly, Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 was overexpressed in oral cancer tissues and cell lines at both mRNA and protein levels. b-AP15, a specific inhibitor of Ubiquitin-specific protease 14, significantly inhibited the growth of cancer cells and increased cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, knockdown of Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 by shRNA significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of cancer cells in vitro. Finally, using a xenograft mouse model of oral squamous cell carcinoma, knockdown of Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 markedly inhibited tumor growth and triggered the cancer cell apoptosis in vivo, supporting previous results. In conclusion, for the first time we have demonstrated the expression pattern of Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 in oral squamous cell carcinoma and verified a relationship with tumor growth and metastasis. These results may highlight new therapeutic strategies for tumor treatment, application of Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 selective inhibitor, such as b-AP15, or knockdown by shRNA. Collectively, Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 could be a potential therapeutic target for oral squamous cell carcinoma patients.

MiroRNA-127-3p targets XRCC3 to enhance the chemosensitivity of esophageal cancer cells to a novel phenanthroline-dione derivative,

Abstract: MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs with 18–22 nucleotides in length and have been proposed to function in various biological processes by targeting genes for post-transcriptional degradation via their 3′ untranslated region. Moreover, they have been suggested to improve the chemosensitivity in a panel of tumors. However, the biological functions of microRNA-127-3p in esophageal carcinogenesis are still enigmatic. Thus, in the study, we firstly analyzed the roles of microRNA-127-3p in regulating the growth of esophageal cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Afterwards, using the microRNA-targeted gene prediction software and the dual-luciferase reporter assays, we confirmed that microRNA-127-3p specifically reduced the expression of X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 3, one of RAD51 recombinase paralogs, at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, using the homologous recombination repair and non-homologous end joining repair reporter systems, we found that microRNA-127-3p specifically compromised the homologous recombination repair and significantly increased DNA double strand breaks in cells. Besides, it statistically increased the chemosensitivity of esophageal cancer cells to a novel phenanthroline-dione derivative in vivo by mechanistically impairing the recruitment of RAD51 to the damage sites. In summary, our findings not only suggest that microRNA-127-3p can be used as a predictor for evaluating the development of esophageal carcinoma, but also show that it can be used to increase the chemosensitivity of esophageal cancer patients to the phenanthroline-dione derivative, which might be a potential anticancer candidate in the future.

Abstract: The use of by-products or wastes as phase change materials (PCM) in thermal energy storage (TES) systems is a good option to decrease the cost of such systems. One of the main disadvantages of PCM if inorganic materials are used is subcooling, as was found with bischofite, a by-product from the Chilean non-metallic industry, which subcooling is about 36°C. Subcooling can be reduced by the addition of nucleating agents, but the selection of the best nucleating agent should be done taking into consideration the physical and chemical parameters of the salt hydrate. In this paper the parameters considered were the solubility of the materials in water, the chemical structure and the crystalline structure (crystal system, lattice parameters, density, cell volume, Z, and space group). It could be concluded that solubility, chemical structure and the crystal system have no influence in the nucleation capacity of a salt hydrate. The parameter that needs to be considered when selecting a nucleating agent for a salt hydrate is the lattice parameters of the crystal structure (cell longitude or angle).

Abstract: In this work, we present the first report on thin film solar cells that employ Cu2MnSnS4 (CMTS) and Cu2MnSn(S, Se)4 (CMTSSe) as the absorber. CMTS and CMTSSe thin films are fabricated using a low cost spray pyrolysis technique in ambient atmosphere using water as a solvent. The crystal structure of the materials are similar to the established kesterite type photovoltaic materials such as Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe). The bandgap of these materials is between 1.4−1.7eV, which is ideal for optimum solar absorption and can be tuned by varying the ratio of the elemental constituents. The photovoltaic device with a structure of Mo/CMTS/CdS/TCO/top electrode is fabricated as a proof-of-concept and yields a power conversion efficiency of ~0.73% for the best optimized CMTS device with Na doping. Through analysis of the device characteristics, we identify a key problem of very high carrier density in the CMTS/CMTSSe absorber that leads to short collection length, low Voc, low quantum efficiency at long wavelength and high shunt conductance that quench the fill factor. We also discuss several routes to improve the device performance.

Abstract: Solar-powered consumer electronics are a likely starting point for organic photovoltaic (OPV) market development. Therefore, a generic discrete choice experiments study can determine how Flemish consumers value solar-cell characteristics for solar-powered consumer electronics. Such characteristics include efficiency, lifetime, aesthetics, integratability, and price. We contribute to the literature by investigating preference heterogeneity in a solar-power niche market with an experimental design with a fixed reference alternative. The error components random parameter logit (ECRPL) with interactions provides a better fit than the latent class (LC) model for our choice data. The main effects had the expected signs. Consequently, aesthetics and integratability are OPV's assets. Nevertheless, heterogeneity puts the results that are valid for the average consumer into perspective. Based on our findings, OPV commercialization efforts should target the experienced, impatient user who highly values design and functionality.

Abstract: Compact thin film of antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) as a promising absorber layer was obtained by rapid thermal evaporation (RTE) rather than conventional chemical bath deposition or atomic layer deposition based methods. The systematical characterizations of Sb2S3 film demonstrated the pure phase, void free and high crystallization. The large grain and preferential growth of Sb2S3 thin film were implemented by crystallization and cooling techniques, respectively. The corresponding devices were gradually optimized with a power conversion efficiency of ~3.5%, almost three times of planar devices fabricated by vacuum method. Both the non-oxide buffer layer (CdS layer) and free of hole transport layer enabled the high stability of the non-encapsulated planar devices. The high throughput and reliable RTE fabrication technique, environment-friendly and earth-abundant Sb2S3 materials, stable and superior device performances were expected to drive the research progress of Sb2S3 thin film photovoltaics.

Abstract: We report on evaluation of effective carrier lifetimes of Si nanowires, which were selectively grown inside nanochannels of anodic aluminum oxide template using gas source molecule beam epitaxy. The carrier lifetime measurements were conducted under different injection level of irradiated photons at wavelength of 349nm. It was found that anodic aluminum oxide template functioned not only as a mechanical guide of Si nanowires but also as an efficient passivation material. The effective carrier lifetime increased from 39 to 65.8μs upon postdeposition anneal of 400°C. Furthermore, thermal treatment at 650°C could enhance the excited carriers to diffuse inside Si substrate and yielded a promising effective carrier lifetime of 152μs. The Si nanowires embedded with anodic aluminum oxide templates are proved to be as potential candidate for fabrication of high efficiency solar cells.

Abstract: Autophagy modulation has been considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for lung diseases. The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway may be one of the main targets for regulation of autophagy. We previously reported that a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor PF-04691502 suppressed hepatoma cells growth in vitro. However, it is still unclear whether PF-04691502 induces autophagy and its roles in DNA damage and cell death in human lung cancer cells. In this study, we investigate the effects of PF-04691502 on the autophagy and its correlation with cell apoptosis and DNA damage in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. PF-04691502 efficiently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity in A549 and H1299 cells. PF-04691502 also triggered apoptosis and the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. Phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX), a hallmark of DNA damage response, was dramatically induced by PF-04691502 treatment. By exposure to PF-04691502, A549 cells acquired a senescent-like phenotype with an increase in the level of β-galactosidase. Furthermore, PF-04691502 enhanced the expression of LC3-II in a concentration-dependent manner. More interestingly, effects of PF-04691502 on toxicity and DNA damage were remarkably increased by co-treatment with an autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ), in human lung cancer cells. These data suggest that a strategy of blocking autophagy to enhance the activity of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors warrants further attention in treatment of NSCLC cells.

Abstract: Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) could intercalate between the side-chains of poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (pBTTT) creating a stable co-crystal structure, so optimal solar cell performance was obtained at high PC71BM concentrations promoting phase separated electron conductive pathways. Neutron reflectivity, with the application of magnetic contrast variation, was used to investigate the concentration profile of PC71BM within the active layer. And this profile was found to be homogeneous through the film thickness. Small angle neutron scattering was utilized to find there is amorphous PC71BM even at 50wt% of fullerene while previously it was believed that all fullerene was consumed to form co-crystals when its concentration is below 75wt%. These fullerene molecules evolve into approximately 15nm sized agglomerates to improve the electron transport when their concentration is above 75wt%. Thermal annealing gives these agglomerates mobility to form micrometer sized crystals causing a decrease of device performance. These findings can therefore correlate the morphology, especially in terms of fullerene agglomerates, vertical concentration profile and percolating structure they formed, with the device performance and provide valuable guidance for optimal morphology design of polymer: fullerene solar cells.

Abstract: A novel WAlN/WAlON/Al2O3 coating was successfully deposited on stainless steel (SS) substrate using reactive DC and RF magnetron sputtering. Excellent spectrally selective property with a high absorptance of 0.958 in the solar spectrum region and low emittance of 0.08 in the infrared region were achieved by tailoring the target power, deposition time and the reactive flow rates of N2 and O2. In the present solar selective coating, W layer acts as a back reflector and diffusion barrier, WAlN as the main absorber layer, WAlON as the semi-absorber layer, whereas the topmost Al2O3 layer works as an anti-reflecting layer. In reference to the thermal stability, the absorber deposited on SS substrates exhibited high solar selectivity (α/ε) of 0.920/0.11, when heat treated in air up to 500°C for 2hrs. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that the WAlN/WAlON/Al2O3-based selective absorbing coating with excellent thermal stability could be a promising material for photo-thermal conversion at temperatures of up to 500°C.

Abstract: Segregated elements and their diffusion profiles within grain boundaries and interfaces resulting from post deposition heat treatments are revealed using atom probe tomography (APT), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and electron beam induced current (EBIC) techniques. The results demonstrate how these techniques complement each other to provide conclusive evidence for locations of space charge regions and mechanisms that create them at the nanoscale. Most importantly, a Cl dopant profile that extends ~5nm into CdTe grains interfacing the CdS is shown using APT and STEM synergy, which has been shown to push the pn-junction into the CdTe layer indicative of a homojunction (revealed by STEM EBIC). In addition, Cu and Cl concentrations within grain boundaries within several nms and µms from the CdS/CdTe interface are compared, Na segregation of <0.1% is detected, and S variations of ~1–3% are witnessed between CdTe grains close to the CdS/CdTe interface. The segregation and diffusion of these elements have a direct impact on the material properties, such as band gap energy and n/p type properties. Optimization of the interfacial and grain boundary doping will lead to higher efficiency solar cells.

Abstract: It is important to study the photoconductivity to understand the optoelectronic properties of semiconductor thin films. Here, we report the effect of Na doping on the photoconductivity properties of CZTS (Cu2ZnSnS4) in the visible and NIR region. CZTS thin films were deposited on quartz and silicon dioxide substrates using stacked layer reactive sputtering and annealing. The photoconductivity of undoped CZTS and Na-doped CZTS in visible region (excitation wavelength – 532nm) and in the NIR region (excitation wavelength – 1064nm) were studied. At a bias voltage of 150mV, response rise time for undoped CZTS in the visible region was 1.02s which decreased to 391ms for Na-doped CZTS. The rise time in NIR region decreased from 245ms (for undoped CZTS) to 1.06ms (for Na-doped CZTS). The decay time for undoped sample (in the visible region) was 1.20s, which decreased to 221ms (for Na-doped CZTS). In the NIR region, the decay time decreased from 342ms (undoped CZTS) to 29.80ms (Na-doped CZTS). A large increase in the photocurrent response (from 6.5 to 2320 times in the visible region and from 12.6 to 3384 times in the NIR region) in the CZTS upon Na doping was observed. Thus, switching in the NIR region is improved drastically upon Na doping in CZTS. Therefore, it can be concluded that Na-doped CZTS can be utilized as NIR photodetector.

Abstract: The confluence of high-temperature (~1600–3200K) flameless combustion chambers and vertical-junction (VJ) photovoltaics creates the possibility of ultra-compact high-efficiency thermophotovoltaic (TPV) generators. The actively-cooled cells can be sited at the chamber's aperture without contaminating or damaging them. The flux density, however, is then well above values at which conventional TPV cells can operate efficiently due to the series resistance losses at photo-generated current densities of the order of tens to hundreds of A/cm2. Generally, this problem is resolved by distancing the cells from the radiator, but at the price of dramatically increasing the requisite cell area and system size. VJ cells offer an intrinsically low-current low-series-resistance configuration that obviates the problem. But carrier dynamics then mandate that only indirect-bandgap semiconductors can provide practical solutions. Silicon and Germanium are the candidates analyzed here, with simulated performance rivaling or exceeding current TPV generators. We also evaluate the degree to which efficiency can be increased by introducing a cell back-surface mirror that recirculates sub-bandgap photons back to the combustion region. The unobvious energetic advantage of recirculating photons by (1) increasing combustion chamber temperature at fixed fuel consumption rate, vs. (2) reducing fuel consumption rate at fixed combustion chamber temperature is also evaluated.

Abstract: The extract of the herbaceous plant St. John’s wort (SJW) and its phloroglucinol component hyperforin (HPF) were previously shown to inhibit cytokine-induced STAT-1 and NF-κB activation and prevent damage in pancreatic β cells. To further clarify the mechanisms underlying their protective effects, we evaluated the phosphorylation state of various factors of cytokine signaling pathways and the expression of target genes involved in β-cell function, inflammatory response and apoptosis induction. In the INS-1E β-cell line, exposed to a cytokine mixture with/without SJW extract (2–5μg/ml) or HPF (1–5μM), protein phosphorylation was assessed by western blotting and expression of target genes by real-time quantitative PCR. SJW and HPF markedly inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner (from 60 to 100%), cytokine-induced activating phosphorylations of STAT-1, NF-κB p65 subunit and IKK (NF-κB inhibitory subunit IκBα kinase). MAPK and Akt pathways were also modulated by the vegetal compounds through hindrance of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK and Akt phosphorylations, each reduced by at least 65% up to 100% at the higher dose. Consistently, SJW and HPF a) abolished cytokine-induced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory genes; b) avoided down-regulation of relevant β-cell functional/differentiation genes; c) corrected cytokine-driven imbalance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, by fully preventing up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes and preserving expression or function of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members; d) protected INS-1E cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, SJW extract and HPF exert their protective effects through simultaneous inhibition of multiple phosphorylation steps along various cytokine signaling pathways and consequent restriction of inflammatory and apoptotic gene expression. Thus, they have a promising therapeutic potential for the prevention or limitation of immune-mediated β-cell dysfunction and damage leading to type 1 diabetes.

Abstract: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are the predominant pathogens of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Although these viruses exhibit genetic homology, the clinical manifestations caused by the two viruses have some discrepancies. In addition, the underlying mechanisms leading to these differences remain unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in numerous biological or pathological processes, including host responses to viral infections. Here, we focused on differences in miRNA expression patterns in rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with EV71 and CA16 at various time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results demonstrated that 106 known and 13 novel miRNAs exhibited significant differences, and 32 key miRNAs among them for target prediction presented opposite trends in the EV71- and CA16-infected samples. GO and pathway analysis of the predicted targets showed enrichment in 14 biological processes, 10 molecular functions, 8 cellular components and 104 pathways. Subsequently, regulatory networks of miRNA-transcription factors, miRNA-predicted targets, miRNA-GOs and miRNA-pathways were constructed to reveal the complex regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during the infection phase. Ultimately, we analysed hierarchical GO categories of the predicted targets involved in immune system processes, which indicated that the innate and adaptive immunity following EV71 and CA16 infections may be remarkably distinct. In conclusion, this report is the first describing miRNA expression profiles in PBMCs with EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. Our findings could provide a valuable basis for further studies on the regulatory roles of miRNAs related to the different immune responses caused by EV71 and CA16 infections.

Abstract: Unencapsulated CIGS solar cells were simultaneously exposed to damp heat and illumination. In-situ monitoring of their electrical parameters demonstrated a rapid decrease of the efficiency, mainly driven by changes in the series and shunt resistances. The non-degraded and degraded solar cells were studied by SIMS and XRD to investigate the material changes leading to efficiency loss. SIMS showed the migration of sodium and potassium, likely leading to changes in the shunt resistance and output voltage. Extensive XRD measurements showed that molybdenum oxide was formed and that the in-plane stress in the ZnO:Al film increased. The stress increase is most likely due to the incorporation of species like hydroxide in the grain boundaries. These phenomena could lead to the observed increased series resistance in the solar cells.
