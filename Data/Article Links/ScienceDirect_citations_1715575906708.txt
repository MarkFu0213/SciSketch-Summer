Abstract: Summary
Heterologous vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) provides a rational strategy to rapidly increase vaccination coverage in many regions of the world. Although data regarding messenger RNA (mRNA) and ChAdOx1 vaccine combinations are available, there is limited information about the combination of these platforms with other vaccines widely used in developing countries, such as BBIBP-CorV and Sputnik V. Here, we assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of 15 vaccine combinations in 1,314 participants. We evaluate immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike response and virus neutralizing titers and observe that a number of heterologous vaccine combinations are equivalent or superior to homologous schemes. For all cohorts in this study, the highest antibody response is induced by mRNA-1273 as the second dose. No serious adverse events are detected in any of the schedules analyzed. Our observations provide rational support for the use of different vaccine combinations to achieve wide vaccine coverage in the shortest possible time.

Abstract: Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is a highly expressed protein in β cells and has been implicated in β cells’ viability and function, however, the role of UCH-L1 in β cells remains unclear. Herein, we examined the functions of UCH-L1 in β cells by utilizing the Drosophila melanogaster model. Our results showed that specific knockdown of dUCH (D.melanogaster homolog of UCH-L1) in Drosophila Insulin-producing cells (D.melanogaster homolog of β cells) induced mitochondria fusion, IPCs death/degeneration, interfered with DILP2 secretion, and triggered the rise of glycogen storage and body weight. Strikingly, the impairment in IPCs cellular activities can be rescued by vitamin C- a strong antioxidant compound, which suggested the relationship between knockdown dUCH and oxidative stress in IPCs; and the potential of this model in screening compounds for β cells function moderation. Since carbohydrate metabolism is an important function of beta cells, we continued to examine the ability to regulate carbohydrate metabolism of knockdown dUCH flies. Our results showed that knockdown dUCH caused the decline of IPCs number under a high-sucrose diet, which finally led to metabolic and physiological disturbances, including total lipid rise, glycogen storage reduction, circulating carbohydrate increase, and weight loss. These symptoms could be early indications of metabolic disorders, particularly β cell dysfunction-related diseases. Taken together, our results indicate that dUCH is essential in the viability and functions of IPCs through the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in the Drosophila model.

Abstract: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological tumor marked by the bcr-abl fusion gene formed by t (9;22) (q34; q11), which translated into the BCR-ABL protein. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been widely used to cure CML patients. Nevertheless, the emergence of TKI resistance has become the problem to the outcome of CML patients. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a kind of Hsp90α deacetylase, was detected to be overexpressed in chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells. Besides, the loss of HDAC6 enzymatic activity can result in the degradation of Hsp90α’s client proteins, such as BCR-ABL, the oncoprotein of CML. Here, we explored the expression of HDAC6 and discovered that it was upregulated compared with control in CML. Then we explored the effect of Rocilinostat (ACY-1215), a specific HDAC6 inhibitor, on CML cells. Our results proved that ACY-1215 could induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in a ROS-dependent manner. Moreover, we detected a downregulation of the BCR-ABL signaling pathway in the ACY-1215 treatment group. Mechanistically, we noted that the upregulation of PTEN was induced after being treated by ACY-1215 and its downstream protein p-Akt was decreased. The Akt activator SC79 can partially reverse the influence of ACY-1215 on CML cells. Besides, our results also proved that ACY-1215 can synergize with imatinib to suppress chronic myeloid leukemia in vitro and in vivo. On the whole, our study revealed that HDAC6 is a possible therapeutic target in CML, and the combination therapy of TKI and HDAC6 inhibitor may improve the outcome of CML patients.

Abstract: Summary
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) selectively regulates the entry of molecules into the central nervous system (CNS). A crosstalk between brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and resident CNS cells promotes the acquisition of functional tight junctions (TJs). Retinoic acid (RA), a key signaling molecule during embryonic development, is used to enhance in vitro BBB models’ functional barrier properties. However, its physiological relevance and affected pathways are not fully understood. P450 oxidoreductase (POR) regulates the enzymatic activity of microsomal cytochromes. POR-deficient (PORD) patients display impaired steroid homeostasis and cognitive disabilities. Here, we used both patient-specific POR-deficient and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated POR-depleted induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BMECs (iBMECs) to study the role of POR in the acquisition of functional barrier properties. We demonstrate that POR regulates cellular RA homeostasis and that POR deficiency leads to the accumulation of RA within iBMECs, resulting in the impaired acquisition of TJs and, consequently, to dysfunctional development of barrier properties.

Abstract: Summary
There is a specific reactivity and characteristic remodeling of the periocular tissue in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). However, local cell changes responsible for these pathological processes have not been sufficiently identified. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing is performed to characterize the transcriptional changes of cellular components in the orbital connective tissue in individuals with TAO. Our study shows that lipofibroblasts with RASD1 expression are highly involved in inflammation and adipogenesis during TAO. ACKR1+ endothelial cells and adipose tissue macrophages may engage in TAO pathogenesis. We find CD8+CD57+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes with the terminal differentiation phenotype to be another source of interferon-γ, a molecule actively engaging in TAO pathogenesis. Cell-cell communication analysis reveals increased activity of CXCL8/ACKR1 and TNFSF4/TNFRSF4 interactions in TAO. This study provides a comprehensive local cell landscape of TAO and may be valuable for future therapy investigation.

Abstract: As CDKN2B-AS1 is demonstrated to exert promotive effects on thyroid cancer (TC), this research aims to investigate the role of cancer stem cell-like cells (CSCs)-derived exosomal CDKN2B-AS1 in TC and the underlying regulatory mechanism. Specifically, CDKN2B expression and the correlation of CDKN2B with CDKN2B-AS1 in TC were determined via bioinformatics analysis and further verified by qRT-PCR. After transfection or co-culture with CSCs-derived exosomes, viability, migration, and invasion of TPC-1 and SW579 cells were evaluated by CCK-8, wound healing, and transwell assays, respectively. The uptake of exosomes by TC cells was detected by PKH67 labeling. In vivo tumor formation and metastasis models were established. Tumor volume and weight were calculated. Metastasis loci in lung tissues were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The expression levels of CDKN2B-AS1, CDKN2B, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition- and TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling-related factors were detected by qRT-PCR or Western blot. Concretely, CDKN2B and CDKN2B-AS1 were highly expressed in TC, and there was a positive correlation between the two. In addition, CDKN2B-AS1 promoted the translation and stability of CDKN2B. Furthermore, CDKN2B-AS1 was highly expressed in CSCs and CSCs-derived exosomes which could be absorbed by TC cells. CDKN2B silencing inhibited viability, migration, invasion, protein levels of CDKN2B, N-cadherin and Vimentin, and TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling, while promoting E-cadherin expression in TC cells. CSCs-derived exosomal CDKN2B-AS1 did oppositely and reversed the effects of CDKN2B silencing on TC cells. CDKN2B silencing impeded tumor growth and metastasis in TC mice, while TGF-β1 performed inversely and impaired the effects of CDKN2B silencing. Collectively, CSCs-derived exosomal CDKN2B-AS1 stabilizes CDKN2B to promote growth and metastasis of TC via TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Human macrophages are a natural host of many mycobacterium species, including Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus), an emerging pathogen affecting immunocompromised and cystic fibrosis patients with few available treatments. The search for an effective treatment is hindered by the lack of a tractable in vitro intracellular infection model. Here, we established a reliable model for M. abscessus infection using human pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages (hPSC-macrophages). hPSC differentiation permitted reproducible generation of functional macrophages that were highly susceptible to M. abscessus infection. Electron microscopy demonstrated that M. abscessus was present in the hPSC-macrophage vacuoles. RNA sequencing analysis revealed a time-dependent host cell response, with differing gene and protein expression patterns post-infection. Engineered tdTOMATO-expressing hPSC-macrophages with GFP-expressing mycobacteria enabled rapid image-based high-throughput analysis of intracellular infection and quantitative assessment of antibiotic efficacy. Our study describes the first to our knowledge hPSC-based model for M. abscessus infection, representing a novel and accessible system for studying pathogen-host interaction and drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate modeling of the heart electrophysiology to predict arrhythmia susceptibility remains a challenge. Current electrophysiological analyses are hypothesis-driven models drawing conclusions from changes in a small subset of electrophysiological parameters because of the difficulty of handling and understanding large datasets. Thus, we develop a framework to train machine learning classifiers to distinguish between healthy and arrhythmic cardiomyocytes using their calcium cycling properties. By training machine learning classifiers on a generated dataset containing a total of 3,003 healthy derived cardiomyocytes and their various arrhythmic states, the multi-class models achieved >90% accuracy in predicting arrhythmia presence and type. We also demonstrate that a binary classifier trained to distinguish cardiotoxic arrhythmia from healthy electrophysiology could determine the key biological changes associated with that specific arrhythmia. Therefore, machine learning algorithms can be used to characterize underlying arrhythmic patterns in samples to improve in vitro preclinical models and complement current in vivo systems.

Abstract: Summary
IL-6 has been shown to be required for somatic cell reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, how Il6 expression is regulated and whether it plays a role during embryo development remains unknown. Here, we describe that IL-6 is necessary for C/EBPα-enhanced reprogramming of B cells into iPSCs but not for B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation. C/EBPα overexpression activates both Il6 and Il6ra genes in B cells and in PSCs. In embryo development, Cebpa is enriched in the trophectoderm of blastocysts together with Il6, while Il6ra is mostly expressed in the inner cell mass (ICM). In addition, Il6 expression in blastocysts requires Cebpa. Blastocysts secrete IL-6 and neutralization of the cytokine delays the morula to blastocyst transition. The observed requirement of C/EBPα-regulated IL-6 signaling for pluripotency during somatic cell reprogramming thus recapitulates a physiologic mechanism in which the trophectoderm acts as niche for the ICM through the secretion of IL-6.

Abstract: Summary
Fine-scale molecular architecture is critical for nervous system and other biological functions. Methods to visualize these nanoscale structures would benefit from enhanced accessibility, throughput, and tissue compatibility. Here, we report RAIN-STORM, a rapid and scalable nanoscopic imaging optimization approach that improves three-dimensional visualization for subcellular targets in tissue at depth. RAIN-STORM uses conventional tissue samples and readily available reagents and is suitable for commercial instrumentation. To illustrate the efficacy of RAIN-STORM, we utilized the retina. We show that RAIN-STORM imaging is versatile and provide 3D nanoscopic data for over 20 synapse, neuron, glia, and vasculature targets. Sample preparation is also rapid, with a 1-day turnaround from tissue to image, and parameters are suitable for multiple tissue sources. Finally, we show that this method can be applied to clinical samples to reveal nanoscale features of human cells and synapses. RAIN-STORM thus paves the way for high-throughput studies of nanoscopic targets in tissue.

Abstract: Summary
A recent study showed that a cocktail of three small molecules, Y-27632, A83-01, and CHIR99021 (YAC), converts mature hepatocytes (MHs) into proliferative bipotent cells that can be induced into MHs and cholangiocytes in rats. However, when we reproduced these experiments, it was found that bipotent cells may be derived from resident liver progenitor cells (LPCs), whose proliferative activity was promoted by YAC. A simple and efficient sorting scheme was also developed in this study to harvest high-purity and high-yield LPCs. The inducible bipotency of purified LPCs was verified; in addition, they were found to spontaneously differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes due to changes in proliferative status even without induction. Moreover, during the differentiation process, some hepatocytes spontaneously reconverted to LPCs under certain conditions, such as the release of contact inhibition. These findings may improve our understanding of LPCs and provide a cell source for regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
The factors that influence the atherosclerotic disease process in high-risk individuals remain poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of vascular imaging, risk factor assessment, and biomarkers to identify factors associated with 3-year change in carotid disease severity in a cohort of high-risk subjects treated with preventive therapy (n = 865). The results show that changes in intima-media thickness (IMT) are most pronounced in the carotid bulb. Progression of bulb IMT demonstrates independent associations with baseline bulb IMT, the plaque gray scale median (GSM), and the plasma level of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (standardized β-coefficients and 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.14 [−0.06 to −0.02] p = 0.001, 0.15 [0.02–0.07] p = 0.001, and 0.20 [0.03–0.07] p < 0.001, respectively). Plasma PDGF correlates with the plaque GSM (0.23 [0.15–0.29] p < 0.001). These observations provide insight into the atherosclerotic process in high-risk subjects by showing that progression primarily occurs in fibrotic plaques and is associated with increased levels of PDGF.

Abstract: Summary
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy causing ventricular tachycardia following adrenergic stimulation. Pathogenic variants in RYR2-encoded ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) cause CPVT1 and cluster into domains I–IV, with the most N-terminal domain involving residues 77–466. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) were generated for RYR2-F13L, -L14P, -R15P, and -R176Q variants. Isogenic control iPSCs were generated using CRISPR-Cas9/PiggyBac. Fluo-4 Ca2+ imaging assessed Ca2+ handling with/without isoproterenol (ISO), nadolol (Nad), and flecainide (Flec) treatment. CPVT1 iPSC-CMs displayed increased Ca2+ sparking and Ca2+ transient amplitude following ISO compared with control. Combined Nad treatment/ISO stimulation reduced Ca2+ amplitude and sparking in variant iPSC-CMs. Molecular dynamic simulations visualized the structural role of these variants. We provide the first functional evidence that these most proximal N-terminal localizing variants alter calcium handling similar to CPVT1. These variants are located at the N-terminal domain and the central domain interface and could destabilize the RYR2 channel promoting Ca2+ leak-triggered arrhythmias.

Abstract: Summary
Age is the strongest determinant of COVID-19 mortality, and over 2 billion people have received primary series vaccination with BNT162b2 (mRNA) or ChAdOx1 (adenoviral vector). However, the profile of sustained vaccine immunogenicity in older people is unknown. Here, we determine spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity to 8 months following BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 in 245 people aged 80–98 years. Vaccines are strongly immunogenic, with antibodies retained in every donor, while titers fall to 23%–26% from peak. Peak immunity develops rapidly with standard interval BNT162b2, although antibody titers are enhanced 3.7-fold with extended interval. Neutralization of ancestral variants is superior following BNT162b2, while neutralization of Omicron is broadly negative. Conversely, cellular responses are stronger following ChAdOx1 and are retained to 33%–60% of peak with all vaccines. BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 elicit strong, but differential, sustained immunogenicity in older people. These data provide a baseline to assess optimal booster regimen in this vulnerable age group.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) is a target candidate for treating leukemia; however, the effects of ClpP modulation on solid tumors have not been adequately explored. Here, we report a potent activator of ClpP with the therapeutic potential for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We first validated that aberrant ClpP activation leads to growth arrest of PDAC cells and tumors. We then performed high-throughput screening and synthetic optimization, from which we identified ZG111, a potent activator of ClpP. ZG111 binds to ClpP and promotes the ClpP-mediated degradation of respiratory chain complexes. This degradation activates the JNK/c-Jun pathway, induces the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, and consequently causes the growth arrest of PDAC cells. ZG111 also produces inhibitory effects on tumor growth in cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Altogether, our data demonstrate a promising therapeutic strategy for PDAC suppression through the chemical activation of ClpP.

One notable vaccine “failure” targeted IsdB, critical for host iron acquisition. We explored a fundamental difference between humans and laboratory animals—natural SA exposure. Recapitulating the failed phase III IsdB vaccine trial, mice previously infected with SA do not mount protective antibody responses to vaccination, unlike naive animals. Non-protective antibodies exhibit increased α2,3 sialylation that blunts opsonophagocytosis and preferentially targets a non-protective IsdB domain. IsdB vaccination of SA-infected mice recalls non-neutralizing humoral responses, further reducing vaccine efficacy through direct antibody competition. IsdB vaccine interference was overcome by immunization against the IsdB heme-binding domain. Purified human IsdB-specific antibodies also blunt IsdB passive immunization, and additional SA vaccines are susceptible to SA pre-exposure. Thus, failed anti-SA immunization trials could be explained by non-protective imprint from prior host-SA interaction.

Abstract: Summary
This is a phase Ib study of anlotinib plus a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor TQB2450 for platinum-resistant or -refractory ovarian cancer. Thirty-four patients are enrolled and receive treatment. The objective response rate (ORR) is 47.1%, and the disease control rate is 97.1%. The median duration of response (DOR) has not been reached, and 61.3% of patients have a DOR of at least 8 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) is 7.8 months, and the median overall survival (OS) has not been reached. The PD-L1-positive group has an ORR of 25.0%, whereas the PD-L1-negative group has an ORR of 92.9%. Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) occur in 70.6% of patients, with the most common being hypertension (29.4%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (29.4%). Anlotinib plus TQB2450 show promising antitumor activity and manageable toxicities in patients with platinum-resistant or -refractory ovarian cancer. A phase 3 randomized controlled trial to further validate our findings is ongoing.

Abstract: Summary
Exosomes play a critical role in intracellular communication. The biogenesis and function of exosomes are regulated by multiple biochemical factors. In the present study, we find that mechanical force promotes the biogenesis of exosomes derived from periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and alters the exosomal proteome profile to induce osteoclastic differentiation. Mechanistically, mechanical force increases the level of exosomal proteins, especially annexin A3 (ANXA3), which facilitates exosome internalization to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), thus inducing osteoclast differentiation. Moreover, the infusion of exosomes derived from PDLSCs into mice promotes mechanical force-induced tooth movement and increases osteoclasts in the periodontal ligament. Collectively, this study demonstrates that mechanical force treatment promotes the biogenesis of exosomes from PDLSCs and increases exosomal protein ANXA3 to facilitate exosome internalization, which activates ERK phosphorylation, thus inducing osteoclast differentiation. Our findings shed light on new mechanisms for how mechanical force regulates the biology of exosomes and bone metabolism.

Abstract: Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a central role in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration, being key to regulate vascular function and promote vascular remodeling in cardiovascular diseases. We recently showed that miR-31-5p promoted oxidative stress in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we aim to investigate whether miR-31-5p and fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 (FNDC5) contribute to Ang II-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. Experiments were performed in primary VSMCs of wide-type (WT) and FNDC5−/− mice as well as the rat A7r5 cell line. We found that Ang II increased miR-31-5p level, reduced FNDC5 expression and stimulated VSMC proliferation and migration, which were aggravated by miR-31-5p mimic, and prevented by miR-31-5p inhibitor in VSMCs. The Ang II-induced VSMC proliferation were prevented by exogenous FNDC5 in both WT and FNDC5−/− mice, while the effects were more significant in FNDC5−/− mice. Furthermore, exogenous FNDC5 reversed the effects of miR-31-5p mimic on VSMC proliferation and migration in Ang II-treated VSMCs. Meanwhile, FNDC5 deficiency prevented the effects of miR-31-5p inhibitor on VSMC proliferation and migration in Ang II-treated VSMCs. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the miR-31-5p upregulation and the following FNDC5 downregulation contribute to Ang II-induced VSMC proliferation and migration.

Abstract: Summary
We describe a modular computational framework for analyzing cell-wide spatiotemporal signaling dynamics in single-cell microscopy experiments that accounts for the experiment-specific geometric and diffractive complexities that arise from heterogeneous cell morphologies and optical instrumentation. Inputs are unique cell geometries and protein concentrations derived from confocal stacks and spatiotemporally varying environmental stimuli. After simulating the system with a model of choice, the output is convolved with the microscope point-spread function for direct comparison with the observable image. We experimentally validate this approach in single cells with BcLOV4, an optogenetic membrane recruitment system for versatile control over cell signaling, using a three-dimensional non-linear finite element model with all parameters experimentally derived. The simulations recapitulate observed subcellular and cell-to-cell variability in BcLOV4 signaling, allowing for inter-experimental differences of cellular and instrumentation origins to be elucidated and resolved for improved interpretive robustness. This single-cell approach will enhance optogenetics and spatiotemporally resolved signaling studies.

Abstract: Summary
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are critical regulators of postnatal bone homeostasis. Osteoporosis is characterized by bone volume and strength deterioration, partly due to MSC dysfunction. Cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) belongs to the transcription-related CDK family. Here, CDK8 in MSCs was identified as important for bone homeostasis. CDK8 level was increased in aged MSCs along with the association with aging-related signals. Mouse genetic studies revealed that CDK8 in MSCs plays a crucial role in bone resorption and homeostasis. Mechanistically, CDK8 in MSCs extrinsically controls osteoclastogenesis through the signal transducer and transcription 1 (STAT1)-receptor activator of the nuclear factor κ Β ligand (RANKL) axis. Moreover, aged MSCs have high osteoclastogenesis-supporting activity, partly through a CDK8-dependent manner. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of CDK8 effectively repressed MSC-dependent osteoclastogenesis and prevented ovariectomy-induced osteoclastic activation and bone loss. These findings highlight that the CDK8-STAT1-RANKL axis in MSCs could play a crucial role in bone resorption and homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Effective biologics require high specificity and limited off-target binding, but these properties are not guaranteed by current affinity-selection-based discovery methods. Molecular counterselection against off targets is a technique for identifying nonspecific sequences but is experimentally costly and can fail to eliminate a large fraction of nonspecific sequences. Here, we introduce computational counterselection, a framework for removing nonspecific sequences from pools of candidate biologics using machine learning models. We demonstrate the method using sequencing data from single-target affinity selection of antibodies, bypassing combinatorial experiments. We show that computational counterselection outperforms molecular counterselection by performing cross-target selection and individual binding assays to determine the performance of each method at retaining on-target, specific antibodies and identifying and eliminating off-target, nonspecific antibodies. Further, we show that one can identify generally polyspecific antibody sequences using a general model trained on affinity data from unrelated targets with potential affinity for a broad range of sequences.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal epithelium plays critical roles in sensing and integrating dietary and microbial signals. How microbiota and intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) interactions regulate host physiology in the proximal small intestine, particularly the duodenum, is unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of duodenal IECs under germ-free (GF) and different conventional microbiota compositions, we show that specific microbiota members alter epithelial homeostasis by increasing epithelial turnover rate, crypt proliferation, and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) expression. Microbiome profiling identified Faecalibaculum rodentium as a key species involved in this regulation. F. rodentium decreases enterocyte expression of retinoic-acid-producing enzymes Adh1, Aldh1a1, and Rdh7, reducing retinoic acid signaling required to maintain certain intestinal eosinophil populations. Eosinophils suppress intraepithelial-lymphocyte-mediated production of interferon-γ that regulates epithelial cell function. Thus, we identify a retinoic acid-eosinophil-interferon-γ-dependent circuit by which the microbiota modulates duodenal epithelial homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The immune memory to common cold coronaviruses (CCCs) influences SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, and understanding its effect is crucial for pan-coronavirus vaccine development. We performed a longitudinal analysis of pre-COVID19-pandemic samples from 2016–2019 in young adults and assessed CCC-specific CD4+ T cell and antibody responses. Notably, CCC responses were commonly detected with comparable frequencies as with other common antigens and were sustained over time. CCC-specific CD4+ T cell responses were associated with low HLA-DR+CD38+ signals, and their magnitude did not correlate with yearly CCC infection prevalence. Similarly, CCC-specific and spike RBD-specific IgG responses were stable in time. Finally, high CCC-specific CD4+ T cell reactivity, but not antibody titers, was associated with pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity. These results provide a valuable reference for understanding the immune response to endemic coronaviruses and suggest that steady and sustained CCC responses are likely from a stable pool of memory CD4+ T cells due to repeated earlier exposures and possibly occasional reinfections.

Abstract: Summary
Connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and reward learning independently predict the transition from acute to chronic back pain (CBP). However, how these predictors are related remains unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigate NAc- and vmPFC-dependent reward learning in 50 patients with subacute back pain (SABP) and follow them over 6 months. Additionally, we compare 29 patients with CBP and 29 pain-free controls to characterize mechanisms of reward learning in the chronic stage. We find that the learning-related updating of the value of reinforcement (prediction error) in the NAc predicts the transition to chronicity. In CBP, compared with controls, vmPFC responses to this prediction error signal are decreased, but increased during a discriminative stimulus. Distinct processes of reward learning in the vmPFC and NAc characterize the development and maintenance of CBP. These could be targeted for the prevention and treatment of chronic pain.

Abstract: Chemotherapy resistance limits the efficacy of cisplatin (DDP) when treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) confers a regulatory role in drug resistance. Innovatively, the regulatory role of circular RNA HIPK2 (circHIPK2) in DDP resistance was probed in the work. In this research, tumor tissues and matched normal tissues were obtained from 52 NSCLC patients, and the expressions of circHIPK2, miR-1249–3p and VEGFA in the tissues were detected by qPCR or Western Blot. Correlation analysis of circHIPK2 expression with survival prognosis and clinicopathological features was conducted. Parental NSCLC cell lines (A549, H460) and DDP-resistant cell lines (A549/DDP, H460/DDP) were selected, and the expression of circHIPK2, miR-1249–3p and VEGFA in the cells were detected. Cell IC50 value, proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and angiogenesis were detected. Tumor xenografts were established to detect the role of circHIPK2 in vivo. The binding relationship between circHIPK2, miR-1249–3p and VEGFA was verified by dual luciferase reporter experiment, RNA pull down and RIP experiment. Our data showed that circHIPK2 and VEGFA were abnormally overexpressed and miR-1249–3p was underexpressed in DDP-resistant NSCLC tissues and cell lines. CircHIPK2 knockdown or miR-1249–3p upregulation inhibited DDP resistance, malignant behavior, and angiogenesis in NSCLC. CircHIPK2 by competitive absorption of miR-1249–3p mediated VEGFA. CircHIPK2 promoted the sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to DDP in NSCLC by regulating VEGFA. CircHIPK2 enhanced the growth of DDP-resistant NSCLC cells in vivo. In conclusion, circHIPK2 has the malignant property for angiogenesis and chemoresistance in NSCLC via the network of miR-1249–3p/VEGFA.

Abstract: The treatment of neuropathic pain (NP) has become an important subject to be studied and solved urgently in clinical practice. The role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in NP development is becoming clear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of lncRNA Miat in NP. In this study, chronic contractionary injury (CCI) mouse NP model was performed. Firstly, the effects of Miat on pain behavior in mice and the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory proteins in spinal cord tissue were explored by interfering with the expression of Miat. Then, Miat-targeted signaling pathway was predicted by bioinformatics and verified by dual luciferase reporter gene and RNA pull down. Finally, the mechanism of Miat was confirmed by the rescue experiments. Our results demonstrated that Miat knockdown alleviated paw withdrawal threshold, paw withdrawal latency, cold hyperalgesia frequency and neuroinflammation in CCI mice. MiR-362-3p was able to bind to Miat and BAMBI. Overall, Miat upregulated BAMBI by inhibiting miR-362-3p, thereby promoting the occurrence and development of NP. This study analyzed the possibility and effectiveness of targeting Miat for NP clinical treatment, in order to provide new ideas and technical methods for NP gene therapy.

Abstract: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a troublesome hygienic problem that afflicts the female population and is associated with extracellular matrix (ECM). Herein, we investigated the effects of microRNA (miR)-34a on ECM metabolism in fibroblasts of SUI via mediating nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (Nampt/NAmPRTase) and hope to find novel insights in the treatment of SUI. Firstly, the anterior vaginal wall tissues of SUI patients and the female vaginal wall fibroblasts (FVWFs) of non-SUI subjects were collected and identified. Then, FVWFs were treated with 10 ng/mL of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) to establish SUI cell models. Subsequently, miR-34a and Nampt expressions in both types of cells were detected via RT-qPCR. It was found that miR-34a was poorly expressed, while Nampt was highly expressed in SUI. Subsequently, IL-1β-treated FVWFs were transfected with miR-34a-mimic and pcDNA3.1-Nampt, respectively. Thereafter, RT-qPCR and Western blot detected that miR-34a overexpression increased COL1A, ACAN, and TIMP-1; decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9; and elevated LC3 II/I ratio, Beclin-1 expression, and the autophagosome number in IL-1β-treated FVWFs, while Nampt upregulation reversed the above outcomes. Then, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay detected that Nampt is a downstream target of miR-34a. Together, miR-34a overexpression promoted autophagy, inhibited ECM degradation in IL-1β-treated FVWFs, and ameliorated SUI via suppressing Nampt.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical data reveal that patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are vulnerable to infection and prone to developing severe sepsis, which greatly compromises the success of transplantation, indicating a dysregulation of inflammatory immune response in this clinical setting. Here, by using a mouse model of haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (haplo-BMT), we found that uncontrolled macrophage inflammation underlies the pathogenesis of both LPS- and E.coli-induced sepsis in recipient animals with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Deficient neutrophil maturation in GVHD mice post-haplo-BMT diminished modulation of macrophage-induced inflammation, which was mechanistically dependent on MMP9-mediated activation of TGF-β1. Accordingly, adoptive transfer of mature neutrophils purified from wild-type donor mice inhibited both sterile and infectious sepsis in GVHD mice post-haplo-BMT. Together, our findings identify a novel mature neutrophil-dependent regulation of macrophage inflammatory response in a haplo-BMT setting and provide useful clues for developing clinical strategies for patients suffering from post-HSCT sepsis.

Abstract: Primary cilia are non-motile sensory cell-organelle that are essential for organismal development, differentiation, and postnatal homeostasis. Their biogenesis and function are mediated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system. Pathogenic variants in IFT52, a central component of the IFT-B complex is associated with short-rib thoracic dysplasia with or without polydactyly 16 (SRTD16), with major skeletal manifestations, in addition to other features. Here we sought to examine the role of IFT52 in osteoblast differentiation. Using lentiviral shRNA interference Ift52 was depleted in C3H10T1/2 mouse mesenchymal stem cells. This led to the disruption of the IFT-B anterograde trafficking machinery that impaired primary ciliogenesis and blocked osteogenic differentiation. In Ift52 silenced cells, Hedgehog (Hh) pathway upregulation during osteogenesis was attenuated and despite Smoothened Agonist (SAG) based Hh activation, osteogenic differentiation was incompletely restored. Further we investigated IFT52 activity in Drosophila, wherein the only ciliated somatic cells are the bipolar sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Knockdown of IFT52 in Drosophila neuronal tissues reduced lifespan with the loss of embryonic chordotonal cilia, and produced severe locomotion, auditory and proprioceptive defects in larva and adults. Together these findings improve our knowledge of the role of IFT52 in various physiological contexts and its associated human disorder.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke (IS) is the most common type of stroke, and its pathophysiological process is more complex. In recent years, the key regulatory roles of non-coding RNA (miRNA, circRNA) and mRNA in the development of IS have attracted more attention. In the process of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, circRNA can regulate nerves, blood vessels and immune system through miRNA/mRNA axis, so as to affect the neurovascular unit of IS. The combination of these noncoding RNAs and mRNAs can be used as non-invasive biomarkers and therapeutic tools for IS diagnosis, prognosis and brain injury. Therefore, it is very important to study the potential molecular mechanism, activation pathway and treatment methods of circRNA/miRNA/mRNA network in IS. This review will focus on the latest progress of circRNA/miRNA/mRNA regulatory network, we have also included some circRNAs, which does not mediate through a miRNA, so we also include circRNA -mRNA network. And explore the application prospect of these RNAs as potential therapeutic targets in the prevention and treatment of IS.

Abstract: Summary
Profiling of gene expression in sparse populations of genetically defined neurons is essential for dissecting the molecular mechanisms that control the development and plasticity of neural circuits. However, current transcriptomic approaches are ill suited for detailed mechanistic studies in sparse neuronal populations, as they either are technically complex and relatively expensive (e.g., single-cell RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]) or require large amounts of input material (e.g., traditional bulk RNA-seq). Thus, we established Meso-seq, a meso-scale protocol for identifying more than 10,000 robustly expressed genes in as little as 50 FACS-sorted neuronal nuclei. We demonstrate that Meso-seq works well for multiple neuroscience applications, including transcriptomics in antibody-labeled cortical neurons in mice and non-human primates, analyses of experience-regulated gene programs, and RNA-seq from visual cortex neurons labeled ultra-sparsely with viruses. Given its simplicity, robustness, and relatively low costs, Meso-seq is well suited for molecular-mechanistic studies in ultra-sparse neuronal populations in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Determining the protection an individual has to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VoCs) is crucial for future immune surveillance, vaccine development, and understanding of the changing immune response. We devised an informative assay to current ELISA-based serology using multiplexed, baited, targeted proteomics for direct detection of multiple proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibody immunocomplex. Serum from individuals collected after infection or first- and second-dose vaccination demonstrates this approach and shows concordance with existing serology and neutralization. Our assays show altered responses of both immunoglobulins and complement to the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.1) VoCs and a reduced response to Omicron (B1.1.1529). We were able to identify individuals who had prior infection, and observed that C1q is closely associated with IgG1 (r > 0.82) and may better reflect neutralization to VoCs. Analyzing additional immunoproteins beyond immunoglobulin (Ig) G, provides important information about our understanding of the response to infection and vaccination.

Abstract: Summary
Secreted proteins mediate essential physiological processes. With conventional assays, it is challenging to map the spatial distribution of proteins secreted by single cells, to study cell-to-cell heterogeneity in secretion, or to detect proteins of low abundance or incipient secretion. Here, we introduce the “FluoroDOT assay,” which uses an ultrabright nanoparticle plasmonic-fluor that enables high-resolution imaging of protein secretion. We find that plasmonic-fluors are 16,000-fold brighter, with nearly 30-fold higher signal-to-noise compared with conventional fluorescence labels. We demonstrate high-resolution imaging of different secreted cytokines in the single-plexed and spectrally multiplexed FluoroDOT assay that revealed cellular heterogeneity in secretion of multiple proteins simultaneously. Using diverse biochemical stimuli, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and a variety of immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and DC-T cell co-culture, we demonstrate that the assay is versatile, facile, and widely adaptable for enhancing biological understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of single-cell secretome.

Abstract: Summary
Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome with high mortality and morbidity worldwide. In this study, we demonstrate that capsaicin not only suppresses inflammation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages, but also effectively inhibits endotoxemia or sepsis-related inflammation in vivo. We have designed and synthesized a series of capsaicin-based probes, which permit the profiling of the target proteins of capsaicin using activity-based protein profiling (ABPP). Among the identified protein targets, we discover that capsaicin directly binds to and inhibits PKM2 and LDHA, and further suppresses the Warburg effect in inflammatory macrophages. Moreover, capsaicin targets COX-2 and downregulates its expression in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, the present findings indicate that capsaicin alleviates the inflammation response and the Warburg effect in a TRPV1-independent manner by targeting PKM2-LDHA and COX-2 in sepsis. Thus, capsaicin may function as a novel agent for sepsis and inflammation treatment.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron rapidly outcompeted other variants and currently dominates the COVID-19 pandemic. Its enhanced transmission and immune evasion are thought to be driven by numerous mutations in the Omicron Spike protein. Here, we systematically introduced BA.1 and/or BA.2 Omicron Spike mutations into the ancestral Spike protein and examined the impacts on Spike function, processing, and susceptibility to neutralization. Individual mutations of S371F/L, S375F, and T376A in the ACE2-receptor-binding domain as well as Q954H and N969K in the hinge region 1 impaired infectivity, while changes to G339D, D614G, N764K, and L981F moderately enhanced it. Most mutations in the N-terminal region and receptor-binding domain reduced the sensitivity of the Spike protein to neutralization by sera from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine and by therapeutic antibodies. Our results represent a systematic functional analysis of Omicron Spike adaptations that have allowed this SARS-CoV-2 variant to dominate the current pandemic.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR systems have revolutionized biomedical research because they offer an unprecedented opportunity for genome editing. However, a bottleneck of applying CRISPR systems in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is how to deliver CRISPR effectors easily and efficiently. Here, we developed modified mRNA (modRNA)-based CRIPSR systems that utilized Cas9 and p53DD or a base editor (ABE8e) modRNA for the purposes of knocking out genes in hPSCs via simple lipid-based transfection. ABE8e modRNA was employed to disrupt the splice donor site, resulting in defective splicing of the target transcript and ultimately leading to gene knockout. Using our modRNA CRISPR systems, we achieved 73.3% ± 11.2% and 69.6 ± 3.8% knockout efficiency with Cas9 plus p53DD modRNA and ABE8e modRNA, respectively, which was significantly higher than the plasmid-based systems. In summary, we demonstrate that our non-integrating modRNA-based CRISPR methods hold great promise as more efficient and accessible techniques for genome editing of hPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory disease caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In follow up to a phase 1 trial, we perform a longitudinal analysis of immune responses following immunization with the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine MVA-MERS-S encoding the MERS-CoV-spike protein. Three homologous immunizations were administered on days 0 and 28 with a late booster vaccination at 12 ± 4 months. Antibody isotypes, subclasses, and neutralization capacity as well as T and B cell responses were monitored over a period of 3 years using standard and bead-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 50% plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT50), enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot), and flow cytometry. The late booster immunization significantly increases the frequency and persistence of spike-specific B cells, binding immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and neutralizing antibodies but not T cell responses. Our data highlight the potential of a late boost to enhance long-term antibody and B cell immunity against MERS-CoV. Our findings on the MVA-MERS-S vaccine may be of relevance for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Histone lysine methylation is an epigenetic mark that can control gene expression. In particular, H3K9me3 contributes to transcriptional repression by regulating chromatin structure. Successful mitotic progression requires correct timing of chromatin structure changes, including epigenetic marks. However, spatiotemporal information on histone modifications in living cells remains limited. In this study, we created an FRET-based probe for live-cell imaging based on the HP1α chromodomain (HP1αCD), which binds to H3K9me3. The probe was incorporated into chromatin and the emission ratio decreased after treatment with histone methyltransferase inhibitors, indicating that it successfully traced dynamic changes in H3K9me3. Upon entry into mitosis, the probe’s emission ratio transiently increased with a concomitant increase in H3K9me3, then exhibited a stepwise decrease, probably due to loss of HP1αCD binding caused by phosphorylation of H3S10 and demethylation of H3K9me3. This probe will be a useful tool for detecting dynamic changes in chromatin structure associated with HP1α.

Abstract: Summary
Microbiota-induced tumorigenesis is well established in solid tumors of the gastrointestinal tract but rarely explored in hematologic malignancies. To determine the role of gut microbiota in lymphoma progression, we performed metagenomic sequencing on human primary gastrointestinal B cell lymphomas. We identified a distinct microbiota profile of intestinal lymphoma, with significantly decreased symbiotic microbes, particularly the genus Eubacterium and notably butyrate-producing Eubacterium rectale. Transfer of E. rectale-deficit microbiota of intestinal lymphoma patients to mice caused inflammation and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. Conversely, E. rectale treatment reduced TNF levels and the incidence of lymphoma in sensitized Eμ-Myc mice. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide from the resident microbiota of lymphoma patients and mice synergizes with TNF signaling and reinforces the NF-κB pathway via the MyD88-dependent TLR4 signaling, amalgamating in enhanced intestinal B cell survival and proliferation. These findings reveal a mechanism of inflammation-associated lymphomagenesis and a potential clinical rationale for therapeutic targeting of gut microbiota.

Abstract: The critical roles of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in immune reactions associated with viral infection and autoimmune disease are well known. To date, however, its roles in the alloimmune response and the immunosuppressive effect of HSP90 inhibitors in allotransplantation have remained unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the therapeutic efficacy of the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG in allotransplantation models. C57BL/6 (H-2b) and BALB/c (H-2d) mice were used as donors for and recipients of skin and heart transplantation, respectively. Treatment with 17-DMAG (daily i.p.) or a vehicle was initiated 3 days before transplantation. Immunological outcomes were assessed by histopathological examinations, flow cytometric analysis, quantitative RT-PCR, ELISA, ELISPOT assay, and MLR. 17-DMAG treatment significantly prolonged the survival of both skin and heart allografts. In 17-DMAG-treated mice, donor-reactive splenocytes producing IFN-γ were significantly reduced along with the intragraft mRNA expression level and serum concentration of IFN-γ. Intragraft mRNA expression of cytokines and chemokines associated with both innate and adaptive immunity was suppressed in 17-DMAG-treated group. MLR showed suppression of the donor-specific proliferation of CD4 + T and CD19 + B cells in the spleens of 17-DMAG-treated mice. 17-DMAG treatment also reduced the number of activated NK cells. Furthermore, the treatment lowered the titers of donor-specific antibodies in the serum and prolonged a second skin allograft in mice sensitized by previous skin transplantation. HSP90 inhibition by 17-DMAG can affect various immune responses, including innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and humoral immunity, suggesting its therapeutic potential against acute rejection in allotransplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Reactivation of fetal hemoglobin expression by the downregulation of BCL11A is a promising treatment for β-hemoglobinopathies. A detailed understanding of BCL11A-mediated repression of γ-globin gene (HBG1/2) transcription is lacking, as studies to date used perturbations by shRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. We leveraged the dTAG PROTAC degradation platform to acutely deplete BCL11A protein in erythroid cells and examined consequences by nascent transcriptomics, proteomics, chromatin accessibility, and histone profiling. Among 31 genes repressed by BCL11A, HBG1/2 and HBZ show the most abundant and progressive changes in transcription and chromatin accessibility upon BCL11A loss. Transcriptional changes at HBG1/2 were detected in <2 h. Robust HBG1/2 reactivation upon acute BCL11A depletion occurred without the loss of promoter 5-methylcytosine (5mC). Using targeted protein degradation, we establish a hierarchy of gene reactivation at BCL11A targets, in which nascent transcription is followed by increased chromatin accessibility, and both are uncoupled from promoter DNA methylation at the HBG1/2 loci.

Abstract: Summary
The homeostatic mechanisms that fail to restrain chronic tissue inflammation in diseases, such as psoriasis vulgaris, remain incompletely understood. We profiled transcriptomes and epitopes of single psoriatic and normal skin-resident T cells, revealing a gradated transcriptional program of coordinately regulated inflammation-suppressive genes. This program, which is sharply suppressed in lesional skin, strikingly restricts Th17/Tc17 cytokine and other inflammatory mediators on the single-cell level. CRISPR-based deactivation of two core components of this inflammation-suppressive program, ZFP36L2 and ZFP36, replicates the interleukin-17A (IL-17A), granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon gamma (IFNγ) elevation in psoriatic memory T cells deficient in these transcripts, functionally validating their influence. Combinatoric expression analysis indicates the suppression of specific inflammatory mediators by individual program members. Finally, we find that therapeutic IL-23 blockade reduces Th17/Tc17 cell frequency in lesional skin but fails to normalize this inflammatory-suppressive program, suggesting how treated lesions may be primed for recurrence after withdrawal of treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most aggressive cancers and is primarily treated with platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Some ESCCs respond well to NAC. However, biomarkers to predict NAC sensitivity and their response mechanism in ESCC remain unclear. We perform whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing analysis of 141 ESCC biopsy specimens before NAC treatment to generate a machine-learning-based diagnostic model to predict NAC reactivity in ESCC and analyzed the association between immunogenomic features and NAC response. Neutrophil infiltration may play an important role in ESCC response to NAC. We also demonstrate that specific copy-number alterations and copy-number signatures in the ESCC genome are significantly associated with NAC response. The interactions between the tumor genome and immune features of ESCC are likely to be a good indicator of therapeutic capability and a therapeutic target for ESCC, and machine learning prediction for NAC response is useful.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we present a methodology based on multiplexed fluorescence screening of two- or three-dimensional cell cultures in a newly designed multichambered microwell chip, allowing direct assessment of drug or immune cell cytotoxic efficacy. We establish a framework for cell culture, formation of tumor spheroids, fluorescence labeling, and imaging of fixed or live cells at various magnifications directly in the chip together with data analysis and interpretation. The methodology is demonstrated by drug cytotoxicity screening using ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer cells and by cellular cytotoxicity screening targeting tumor spheroids of renal carcinoma and ovarian carcinoma with natural killer cells from healthy donors. The miniaturized format allowing long-term cell culture, efficient screening, and high-quality imaging of small sample volumes makes this methodology promising for individualized cytotoxicity tests for precision medicine.

Abstract: Macrophage phenotypes are simplistically classified as pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic (M2). Phenotypically different macrophages are putatively involved in vocal fold (VF) fibrosis. The current study investigated interactions between macrophages and VF fibroblasts. THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages were treated with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/IFN-γ, interleukin-10 (IL10), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β), or interleukin-4 (IL4) for 24 h (M(IFN), M(IFN/LPS), M(IL10), M(TGF), and M(IL4), respectively; M(−) denotes untreated macrophages). Differentially activated macrophages and human VF fibroblasts were co-cultured ± direct contact. Expression of CXCL10, CCN2, ACTA2, FN1, TGM2, and LOX was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Type I collagen and smooth muscle actin (SMA) were observed by immunofluorescence. CXCL10 and PTGS2 were upregulated in fibroblasts indirectly co-cultured with M(IFN) and M(IFN/LPS). M(TGF) stimulated CCN2, ACTA2, and FN1 in fibroblasts. Enzymes involved in extracellular matrix crosslinking (TGM2, LOX) were increased in monocultured M(IL4) compared to M(−). Direct co-culture with all macrophages increased type I collagen and SMA in fibroblasts. Macrophage phenotypic shift was consistent with stimulation and had downstream differential effects on VF fibroblasts. Direct contact with macrophages, regardless of phenotype, stimulated a pro-fibrotic response in VF fibroblasts. Collectively, these data suggest meaningful interactions between macrophages and fibroblasts mediate fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal cultures provide a basis for reductionist insights that rely on molecular and pharmacological manipulation. However, the inability to culture mature adult CNS neurons limits our understanding of adult neuronal physiology. Here, we report methods for culturing adult central nervous system neurons in large numbers and across multiple brain regions for extended time periods. Primary adult neuronal cultures develop polarity; they establish segregated dendritic and axonal compartments, maintain resting membrane potentials, exhibit spontaneous and evoked electrical activity, and form neural networks. Cultured adult neurons isolated from different brain regions such as the hippocampus, cortex, brainstem, and cerebellum exhibit distinct cell morphologies, growth patterns, and spontaneous firing characteristics reflective of their regions of origin. Using adult motor cortex cultures, we identify a CNS “conditioning” effect after spinal cord injury. The ability to culture adult neurons offers a valuable tool for studying basic and therapeutic science of the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) perform organ-specific functions that are dependent on factors such as hematopoietic origin, local environment, and biological influences. A diverse range of in vitro culture systems have been developed to decipher TRM functions, including bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived TRMs, or immortalized cell lines. However, despite the usefulness of such systems, there are notable limitations. Attempts to culture primary macrophages often require purification of cells and lack a high cell yield and consistent phenotype. Here, we aimed to address these limitations by establishing an organotypic primary cell culture protocol. We obtained long-term monocultures of macrophages derived from distinct organs without prior purification using specific growth factors and tissue normoxic conditions that largely conserved a TRM-like identity in vitro. Thus, this organotypic system offers an ideal screening platform for primary macrophages from different organs that can be used for a wide range of assays and readouts.

Abstract: Summary
New therapeutic concepts are critically needed for carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen particularly recalcitrant to antibiotics. The screening of around 230,000 small molecules yielded a very low hit rate of 0.002% after triaging for known antibiotics. The only novel hit that stood out was the antimetabolite oxythiamine. Oxythiamine is a known transketolase inhibitor in eukaryotic cells, but its antibacterial potency has not been reported. Metabolic and transcriptomic analyses indicated that oxythiamine is intracellularly converted to oxythiamine pyrophosphate and subsequently inhibits several vitamin-B1-dependent enzymes, sensitizing the bacteria to several antibiotic and non-antibiotic drugs such as tetracyclines, 5-fluorouracil, and auranofin. The positive interaction between 5-fluorouracil and oxythiamine was confirmed in a murine ocular infection model, indicating relevance during infection. Together, this study revealed a system-level significance of thiamine metabolism perturbation that sensitizes P. aeruginosa to multiple small molecules, a property that could inform on the development of a rational drug combination.

Abstract: Summary
The development of antibodies that target specific glycan structures on cancer cells or human pathogens poses a significant challenge due to the immense complexity of naturally occurring glycans. Automated glycan assembly enables the production of structurally homogeneous glycans in amounts that are difficult to derive from natural sources. Nanobodies (Nbs) are the smallest antigen-binding domains of heavy-chain-only antibodies (hcAbs) found in camelids. To date, the development of glycan-specific Nbs using synthetic glycans has not been reported. Here, we use defined synthetic glycans for alpaca immunization to elicit glycan-specific hcAbs, and describe the identification, isolation, and production of a Nb specific for the tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen Globo-H. The Nb binds the terminal fucose of Globo-H and recognizes synthetic Globo-H in solution and native Globo-H on breast cancer cells with high specificity. These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for generating glycan-targeting Nbs to be used in biomedical and biotechnological applications.

Abstract: Summary
Regenerative therapies aimed at replacing photoreceptors are a promising approach for the treatment of otherwise incurable causes of blindness. However, such therapies still face significant hurdles, including the need to improve subretinal delivery and long-term survival rate of transplanted cells, and promote sufficient integration into the host retina. Here, we successfully delivered in vitro-derived human photoreceptor precursor cells (PRPCs; also known as immature photoreceptors) to the subretinal space of seven normal and three rcd1/PDE6B mutant dogs with advanced inherited retinal degeneration. Notably, while these xenografts were rejected in dogs that were not immunosuppressed, transplants in most dogs receiving systemic immunosuppression survived up to 3–5 months postinjection. Moreover, differentiation of donor PRPCs into photoreceptors with synaptic pedicle-like structures that established contact with second-order neurons was enhanced in rcd1/PDE6B mutant dogs. Together, our findings set the stage for evaluating functional vision restoration following photoreceptor replacement in canine models of inherited retinal degeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal asthma status, prenatal exposures, and infant gut microbiota perturbation are associated with heightened risk of atopy and asthma risk in childhood, observations hypothetically linked by intergenerational microbial transmission. Using maternal vaginal (n = 184) and paired infant stool (n = 172) samples, we identify four compositionally and functionally distinct Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota clusters (VCs) that relate to prenatal maternal health and exposures and infant serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) status at 1 year. Variance in bacteria shared between mother and infant pairs relate to VCs, maternal allergy/asthma status, and infant IgE levels. Heritable bacterial gene pathways associated with infant IgE include fatty acid synthesis and histamine and tryptophan degradation. In vitro, vertically transmitted Lactobacillus jensenii strains induce immunosuppressive phenotypes on human antigen-presenting cells. Murine supplementation with L. jensenii reduces lung eosinophils, neutrophilic expansion, and the proportion of interleukin-4 (IL-4)+ CD4+ T cells. Thus, bacterial and atopy heritability are intimately linked, suggesting a microbial component of intergenerational disease transmission.

Abstract: Summary
We here investigate the impact of antiviral treatments such as remdesivir on intra-host genomic diversity and emergence of SARS-CoV2 variants in patients with a prolonged course of infection. Sequencing and variant analysis performed in 112 longitudinal respiratory samples from 14 SARS-CoV2-infected patients with severe disease progression show that major frequency variants do not generally arise during prolonged infection. However, remdesivir treatment can increase intra-host genomic diversity and result in the emergence of novel major variant species harboring fixed mutations. This is particularly evident in a patient with B cell depletion who rapidly developed mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene following remdesivir treatment. Remdesivir treatment-associated emergence of novel variants is of great interest in light of current treatment guidelines for hospitalized patients suffering from severe SARS-CoV2 disease, as well as the potential use of remdesivir to preventively treat non-hospitalized patients at high risk for severe disease progression.

Abstract: The myocardial fibrosis in response to myocardial infarction (MI) is closely related to the dysbalance of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Although numerous reports indicate that α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) activates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) to regulate the magnitude of inflammatory responses, the role of α7nAChR in myocardial fibrosis, as well as the underlying mechanisms, have not been elucidated. In this study, we evaluated cardiac function, fibrosis, and EndMT signaling using a mouse model of MI and interleukin (IL)-1β-induced human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs). In vivo, α7nAChR deletion increased cardiac dysfunction, exacerbated the cardiac inflammatory response, and NF-κB activation, and enhanced EndMT, as shown by higher expression levels of fibroblast markers (FSP-1, α-SMA, collagen I, Snail) and decreased levels of the FGFR1, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and endothelial marker (CD31) compared to wild-type mice. In vitro, the pharmacological activation of α7nAChR with PNU282987 significantly inhibited IL-1β-induced EndMT, as shown by a reduced transition to the fibroblast-like phenotype and the expression of fibrotic markers. Moreover, the IL-1β-mediated activation of NF-κB pathway was suppressed by PNU282987. This anti-EndMT effect of α7nAChR was associated with regulation of Snail. Furthermore, Western blot analysis further revealed that the GR antagonist RU38486 could partially counteract the effect of PNU282987 on NF-κB expression. In conclusion, our results show that α7nAChR is involved in cardiac fibrosis by inhibiting EndMT, providing a novel approach to the treatment of MI.

Abstract: The reconstruction of a blood supply system and myocardial recovery from inflamamtory reactions in the infract zone remains a challenge in cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction. Here, we observed that the local myocardial cells and the clotted blood cells undergo cellular remodeling via cytoplasmic exocytosis and nuclear reorganization in zebrafish hearts after resection of the ventricular apex. The subsequent tissue regeneration processes were visualized by detection of the spatiotemporal expression of three tissue specific genes (α-SMA which marks for vasculature/fibrogenesis, Flk1for angiogenesis/hematopoiesis, and Pax3a for remusculogensis), and two histone modification markers (H3K9Ac and H3K9Me3 for chromatin remodeling). By analyzing the composition of the blastema tissue fractions we found that Krt5 peptide could promote F-actin assembly, BMP4-pSmad2/5/8 signaling activity, and H3K9Me3-mediated chromatin accessibility at the blastema representative genes in the cultured zebrafish embryonic fibroblasts. Further in vivo tests demonstrated that Krt5 interacted with beta actin, and promoted Gata3 expression and Flk1-GFP marked blastema angiogenesis. These results proposed a new Krt5-cytoskeleton-BMP4 mechanotransduction mechanism in the epithelial-dependent and cell phenotype conversion-based tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
B and T cell receptor (immune) repertoires can represent an individual’s immune history. While current repertoire analysis methods aim to discriminate between health and disease states, they are typically based on only a limited number of parameters. Here, we introduce immuneREF: a quantitative multidimensional measure of adaptive immune repertoire (and transcriptome) similarity that allows interpretation of immune repertoire variation by relying on both repertoire features and cross-referencing of simulated and experimental datasets. To quantify immune repertoire similarity landscapes across health and disease, we applied immuneREF to >2,400 datasets from individuals with varying immune states (healthy, [autoimmune] disease, and infection). We discovered, in contrast to the current paradigm, that blood-derived immune repertoires of healthy and diseased individuals are highly similar for certain immune states, suggesting that repertoire changes to immune perturbations are less pronounced than previously thought. In conclusion, immuneREF enables the population-wide study of adaptive immune response similarity across immune states.

Abstract: Summary
Coxsackievirus B1 (CVB1) is an emerging pathogen associated with severe neonatal diseases including aseptic meningitis, myocarditis, and pancreatitis and also with the development of type 1 diabetes. We characterize the binding and therapeutic efficacies of three CVB1-specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) identified for their ability to inhibit host receptor engagement. High-resolution cryo-EM structures showed that these antibodies recognize different epitopes but with an overlapping region in the capsid VP2 protein and specifically the highly variable EF loop. Moreover, they perturb capsid-receptor interactions by binding various viral particle forms. Antibody combinations achieve synergetic neutralization via a stepwise capsid transition and virion disruption, indicating dynamic changes in the virion in response to multiple nAbs targeting the receptor-binding site. Furthermore, this three-antibody cocktail protects against lethal challenge in neonatal mice and limits pancreatitis and viral replication in a non-obese diabetic mouse model. These results illustrate the utility of nAbs for rational design of therapeutics against picornaviruses such as CVB.

Abstract: Summary
Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have wide potential application in basic research, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine, but functional maturation remains challenging. Here, we present a method whereby maturation of hiPSC-CMs can be accelerated by simultaneous application of physiological Ca2+ and frequency-ramped electrical pacing in culture. This combination produces positive force-frequency behavior, physiological twitch kinetics, robust β-adrenergic response, improved Ca2+ handling, and cardiac troponin I expression within 25 days. This study provides insights into the role of Ca2+ in hiPSC-CM maturation and offers a scalable platform for translational and clinical research.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence indicates that gut microbiota may play a key role in vaccination immunity. Here, we investigate whether the human gut microbiota and metabolic function correlate with the BBIBP-CorV vaccine response. A total of 207 participants who received the BBIBP-CorV vaccine are enrolled. The gut microbiome and metabolic functions are investigated using metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic assays. We find that BBIBP-CorV vaccination is accompanied by altered microbiome composition and functional pathways, and the gut microbiome and its functional profiles correlate with the vaccine response. The levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are much higher in the high antibody response group compared to the low response group, and several SCFAs display a positive correlation with the antibody response. Our study highlights that the gut microbiome and its function is associated with the BBIBP-CorV vaccine response, providing evidence for further exploration of microbiome modulation to improve COVID-19 vaccine efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
We developed a multi-unit microscope for all-optical inter-layers circuits interrogation. The system performs two-photon (2P) functional imaging and 2P multiplexed holographic optogenetics at axially distinct planes. We demonstrated the capability of the system to map, in the mouse retina, the functional connectivity between rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and ganglion cells (GCs) by activating single or defined groups of RBCs while recording the evoked response in the GC layer with cell-type specificity and single-cell resolution. We then used a logistic model to probe the functional connectivity between cell types by deriving the “cellular receptive field” describing how RBCs impact each GC type. With the capability to simultaneously image and control neuronal activity at axially distinct planes, the system enables a precise interrogation of multi-layered circuits. Understanding this information transfer is a promising avenue to dissect complex neural circuits and understand the neural basis of computations.

Abstract: Summary
The potential of commensal bacteria to modulate host immunity remains largely uncharacterized, largely due to the vast number of strains that comprise the human gut microbiota. We have developed a screening platform to measure the innate immune responses of myeloid cells to 277 bacterial strains isolated from the gut microbiota of healthy individuals and those with inflammatory bowel diseases. The innate immune responses to gut-derived bacteria are as strong as those toward pathogenic bacteria, and they vary from phylum to strain. Myeloid cells differentially rely upon innate receptors TLR2 or TLR4 to sense taxa, with differential sensing of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria that predict in vivo functions. These innate immune responses can be modeled using combinations of up to 8 Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of strains is stable over time and following fecal microbiota transplantation into new human recipients. Collectively, this high-throughput approach provides an insight into how commensal microorganisms shape innate immune phenotypes.

Abstract: Several studies have confirmed that exosomes containing microRNAs (miRNAs) from the aseptic inflammatory microenvironment play an important role in bone remodeling. But the mechanism that induces changes in the osteogenic ability of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) is still unclear. In the present study, the osteogenic function of periodontal ligament fibroblasts-derived exosomes induced by PGE2 on PDLSCs was detected by real-time PCR, alizarin red assay and alkaline phosphatase staining. High-throughput miRNAs sequencing was used to reveal that miR-34c-5p in exosomes-PGE2 was upregulated compared it in exosomes-normal. Real-time PCR and western blotting assay verified that overexpression of miR-34c-5p inhibited osteogenic differentiation, and reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. In addition, dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-34c-5p targeted special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2). It was shown that exosomal miR-34c-5p inhibited osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs via SATB2/ERK pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The conserved hemagglutinin stalk domain is an attractive target for broadly effective antibody-based therapeutics and next-generation universal influenza vaccines. Protection provided by hemagglutinin stalk-binding antibodies is principally mediated through activation of immune effector cells. Titers of stalk-binding antibodies are highly variable on an individual level and tend to increase with age as a result of increasing exposures to influenza virus. In our study, we show that stalk-binding antibodies cooperate with neuraminidase inhibitors to protect against influenza virus infection in an Fc-dependent manner. These data suggest that the effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors is likely influenced by an individual’s titers of stalk-binding antibodies and that neuraminidase inhibitors may enhance the effectiveness of future stalk-binding monoclonal antibody-based treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Radiocarbon dating is the gold standard in archeology to estimate the age of skeletons, a key to studying their origins. Many published ancient genomes lack reliable and direct dates, which results in obscure and contradictory reports. We developed the temporal population structure (TPS), a DNA-based dating method for genomes ranging from the Late Mesolithic to today, and applied it to 3,591 ancient and 1,307 modern Eurasians. TPS predictions aligned with the known dates and correctly accounted for kin relationships. TPS dating of poorly dated Eurasian samples resolved conflicting reports in the literature, as illustrated by one test case. We also demonstrated how TPS improved the ability to study phenotypic traits over time. TPS can be used when radiocarbon dating is unfeasible or uncertain or to develop alternative hypotheses for samples younger than 10,000 years ago, a limitation that may be resolved over time as ancient data accumulate.

Abstract: Among the hallmarks of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) progression and unresponsiveness to therapy is impaired ubiquitin-dependent degradation of nuclear tumor suppressor protein. In the previous stage, our research group found that as a key tumor suppressor, nuclear dysfunction of p27kip1 is closely related to chemotherapy resistance of CCA, but the specific mechanism is unclear. It was recently shown that p27kip1-driven tumors were strongly dependent on the SUMO pathway. RNF4, as the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL), identifies SUMOylated proteins as a substrate through sumo-interacting motifs (SIM) and causes its degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Here we described that the expression of RNF4 was upregulated in CCA tissues and related to malignant features. Silencing RNF4 arrested human CCA cells at the G1 phase, which was associated with the upregulation of p27kip1 and the downregulation of its downstream cycle-related proteins. Silencing RNF4 inhibited cell proliferation and migration, increased cell apoptosis, and sensitized CCA cells to treatment of chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. Immunofluorescence showed that p27kip1 and RNF4 were mainly co-located in the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot showed that p27kip1 was a target protein for SUMOylation and high expression of RNF4 decreased the levels of nuclear p27kip1, enhanced the levels of ubiquitinated and SUMOylated p27kip1, indicating that RNF4 could regulate cell cycle progression via recognizing SUMOylated p27kip1 and facilitating its ubiquitination degradation. These data indicate that RNF4-mediated ubiquitination degradation of SUMOylated proteins is a novel regulatory mechanism of p27kip1 dysfunction and CCA tumorigenesis, which provides a potential option for therapeutic intervention of CCA.

Abstract: Summary
Disruption of endolysosomal and autophagy-lysosomal systems is increasingly implicated in neurodegeneration. Sodium-proton exchanger 6 (NHE6) contributes to the maintenance of proper endosomal pH, and loss-of function mutations in the X-linked NHE6 lead to Christianson syndrome (CS) in males. Neurodegenerative features of CS are increasingly recognized, with postmortem and clinical data implicating a role for tau. We generated cortical neurons from NHE6 knockout (KO) and isogenic wild-type control human induced pluripotent stem cells. We report elevated phosphorylated and sarkosyl-insoluble tau in NHE6 KO neurons. We demonstrate that NHE6 KO leads to lysosomal and autophagy dysfunction involving reduced lysosomal number and protease activity, diminished autophagic flux, and p62 accumulation. Finally, we show that treatment with trehalose or rapamycin, two enhancers of autophagy-lysosomal function, each partially rescue this tau phenotype. We provide insight into the neurodegenerative processes underlying NHE6 loss of function and into the broader role of the endosome-lysosome-autophagy network in neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Life-long male fertility relies on exquisite homeostasis and the development of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs); however, the underlying molecular genetic and epigenetic regulation in this equilibrium process remains unclear. Here, we document that UHRF1 interacts with snRNAs to regulate pre-mRNA alternative splicing in SSCs and is required for the homeostasis of SSCs in mice. Genetic deficiency of UHRF1 in mouse prospermatogonia results in gradual loss of spermatogonial stem cells, eventually leading to Sertoli-cell-only syndrome (SCOS) and male infertility. Comparative RNA-seq data provide evidence that Uhrf1 ablation dysregulates previously reported SSC maintenance- and differentiation-related genes. We further found that UHRF1 could act as an alternative RNA splicing regulator and interact with Tle3 transcripts to regulate its splicing event in spermatogonia. Collectively, our data reveal a multifunctional role for UHRF1 in regulating gene expression programs and alternative splicing during SSC homeostasis, which may provide clues for treating human male infertility.

Abstract: Summary
A small number of offspring are born from the numerous sperm generated from spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). However, little is known regarding the rules and molecular mechanisms that govern germline transmission patterns. Here we report that the Trp53 tumor suppressor gene limits germline genetic diversity via Cdkn1a. Trp53-deficient SSCs outcompeted wild-type (WT) SSCs and produced significantly more progeny after co-transplantation into infertile mice. Lentivirus-mediated transgenerational lineage analysis showed that offspring bearing the same virus integration were repeatedly born in a non-random pattern from WT SSCs. However, SSCs lacking Trp53 or Cdkn1a sired transgenic offspring in random patterns with increased genetic diversity. Apoptosis of KIT+ differentiating germ cells was reduced in Trp53- or Cdkn1a-deficient mice. Reduced CDKN1A expression in Trp53-deficient spermatogonia suggested that Cdkn1a limits genetic diversity by supporting apoptosis of syncytial spermatogonial clones. Therefore, the TRP53-CDKN1A pathway regulates tumorigenesis and the germline transmission pattern.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) uses small molecules to recruit E3 ubiquitin ligases into the proximity of proteins of interest, inducing ubiquitination-dependent degradation. A major bottleneck in the TPD field is the lack of accessible E3 ligase ligands for developing degraders. To expand the E3 ligase toolbox, we sought to convert the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) inhibitor KI696 into a recruitment handle for several targets. While we were able to generate KEAP1-recruiting degraders of BET family and murine focal adhesion kinase (FAK), we discovered that the target scope of KEAP1 was narrow, as targets easily degraded using a cereblon (CRBN)-recruiting degrader were refractory to KEAP1-mediated degradation. Linking the KEAP1-binding ligand to a CRBN-binding ligand resulted in a molecule that induced degradation of KEAP1 but not CRBN. In sum, we characterize tool compounds to explore KEAP1-mediated ubiquitination and delineate the challenges of exploiting new E3 ligases for generating bivalent degraders.

Abstract: Summary
During metabolism, carboxylic acids are often activated by conjugation to the thiol of coenzyme A (CoA). The resulting acyl-CoAs comprise a group of ∼100 thioester-containing metabolites that could modify protein behavior through non-enzymatic N-acylation of lysine residues. However, the importance of many potential acyl modifications remains unclear because antibody-based methods to detect them are unavailable and the in vivo concentrations of their respective acyl-CoAs are poorly characterized. Here, we develop cysteine-triphenylphosphonium (CysTPP), a mass spectrometry probe that uses “native chemical ligation” to sensitively detect the major acyl-CoAs present in vivo through irreversible modification of its amine via a thioester intermediate. Using CysTPP, we show that longer-chain (C13–C22) acyl-CoAs often constitute ∼60% of the acyl-CoA pool in rat tissues. These hydrophobic longer-chain fatty acyl-CoAs have the potential to non-enzymatically modify protein residues.

Abstract: Summary
Proteasome inhibitor (PI) resistance remains a central challenge in multiple myeloma. To identify pathways mediating resistance, we first mapped proteasome-associated genetic co-dependencies. We identified heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) chaperones as potential targets, consistent with proposed mechanisms of myeloma cells overcoming PI-induced stress. We therefore explored allosteric HSP70 inhibitors (JG compounds) as myeloma therapeutics. JG compounds exhibited increased efficacy against acquired and intrinsic PI-resistant myeloma models, unlike HSP90 inhibition. Shotgun and pulsed SILAC mass spectrometry demonstrated that JGs unexpectedly impact myeloma proteostasis by destabilizing the 55S mitoribosome. Our data suggest JGs have the most pronounced anti-myeloma effect not through inhibiting cytosolic HSP70 proteins but instead through mitochondrial-localized HSP70, HSPA9/mortalin. Analysis of myeloma patient data further supports strong effects of global proteostasis capacity, and particularly HSPA9 expression, on PI response. Our results characterize myeloma proteostasis networks under therapeutic pressure while motivating further investigation of HSPA9 as a specific vulnerability in PI-resistant disease.

Abstract: Summary
Leukemia cells re-program their microenvironment to augment blast proliferation and enhance treatment resistance. Means of clinically targeting such niche-driven treatment resistance remain ambiguous. We develop human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-engineered niches to reveal druggable cancer-niche dependencies. We reveal that mesenchymal (iMSC) and vascular niche-like (iANG) hiPSC-derived cells support ex vivo proliferation of patient-derived leukemia cells, affect dormancy, and mediate treatment resistance. iMSCs protect dormant and cycling blasts against dexamethasone, while iANGs protect only dormant blasts. Leukemia proliferation and protection from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis is dependent on cancer-niche interactions mediated by CDH2. Consequently, we test CDH2 antagonist ADH-1 (previously in Phase I/II trials for solid tumors) in a very aggressive patient-derived xenograft leukemia mouse model. ADH-1 shows high in vivo efficacy; ADH-1/dexamethasone combination is superior to dexamethasone alone, with no ADH-1-conferred additional toxicity. These findings provide a proof-of-concept starting point to develop improved, potentially safer therapeutics targeting niche-mediated cancer dependencies in blood cancers.

Abstract: Summary
The potential of small molecules to localize within subcellular compartments is rarely explored. To probe this question, we measured the localization of Hsp70 inhibitors using fluorescence microscopy. We found that even closely related analogs had dramatically different distributions, with some residing predominantly in the mitochondria and others in the ER. CRISPRi screens supported this idea, showing that different compounds had distinct chemogenetic interactions with Hsp70s of the ER (HSPA5/BiP) and mitochondria (HSPA9/mortalin) and their co-chaperones. Moreover, localization seemed to determine function, even for molecules with conserved binding sites. Compounds with distinct partitioning have distinct anti-proliferative activity in breast cancer cells compared with anti-viral activity in cellular models of Dengue virus replication, likely because different sets of Hsp70s are required in these processes. These findings highlight the contributions of subcellular partitioning and chemogenetic interactions to small molecule activity, features that are rarely explored during medicinal chemistry campaigns.

Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have immunosuppressive properties mediated by MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEV). Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that contain components that regulate immune cell function. We investigated the immunomodulatory effects of MSC-derived Exosome (MSC-Exo) on the severity of colitis using the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model. Exosomes were administrated intraperitoneally. Daily changes in body weight, stool consistency, and bleeding were assessed to determine the impact of MSC-Exos on colitis. Several measurements were taken, including the colon weight, length, and histological analysis of the colon tissues. The percentage of regulatory T cells and IL-10, TGF-β, IL-17, TNF-α, and IFN-γ levels were calculated in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and spleen. The results showed MSC-Exos improved clinical manifestations of colitis. Colon macroscopic and histological observations also showed improvement in tissue destruction. The results illustrated that MSC-Exos might attenuate colitis by regulating Treg/Th17 balance, increasing anti-inflammatory, and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines expression. As a result, MSC-Exos could be used as an immunomodulatory approach to treating bowel inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising therapeutic approach for microbiota-associated pathologies, but our understanding of the post-FMT microbiome assembly process and its ecological and clinical determinants is incomplete. Here we perform a comprehensive fecal metagenome analysis of 14 FMT trials, involving five pathologies and >250 individuals, and determine the origins of strains in patients after FMT. Independently of the underlying clinical condition, conspecific coexistence of donor and recipient strains after FMT is uncommon and donor strain engraftment is strongly positively correlated with pre-FMT recipient microbiota dysbiosis. Donor strain engraftment was enhanced through antibiotic pretreatment and bowel lavage and dependent on donor and recipient ɑ-diversity; strains from relatively abundant species were more likely and from predicted oral, oxygen-tolerant, and gram-positive species less likely to engraft. We introduce a general mechanistic framework for post-FMT microbiome assembly in alignment with ecological theory, which can guide development of optimized, more targeted, and personalized FMT therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare, often lethal, liver cancer affecting adolescents and young adults, for which there are no approved therapeutics. The development of therapeutics is hampered by a lack of in vitro models. Organoids have shown utility as a model system for studying many diseases. In this study, tumor tissue and the adjacent non-tumor liver were obtained at the time of surgery. The tissue was dissociated and grown as organoids. We developed 21 patient-derived organoid lines: 12 from metastases, three from the liver tumor and six from adjacent non-tumor liver. These patient-derived FLC organoids recapitulate the histologic morphology, immunohistochemistry, and transcriptome of the patient tumor. Patient-derived FLC organoids were used in a preliminary high-throughput drug screen to show proof of concept for the identification of therapeutics. This model system has the potential to improve our understanding of this rare cancer and holds significant promise for drug testing and development.

Abstract: Summary
Inherited disorders of B12 metabolism produce a broad spectrum of manifestations, with limited knowledge of the influence of age and the function of related genes. We report a meta-analysis on 824 patients with a genetically proven diagnosis of an inherited disorder of vitamin B12 metabolism. Gene clusters and age categories are associated with patients’ manifestations. The “cytoplasmic transport” cluster is associated with neurological and ophthalmological manifestations, the “mitochondrion” cluster with hypotonia, acute metabolic decompensation, and death, and the “B12 availability” and “remethylation” clusters with anemia and cytopenia. Hypotonia, EEG abnormalities, nystagmus, and strabismus are predominant in the younger patients, while neurological manifestations, such as walking difficulties, peripheral neuropathy, pyramidal syndrome, cerebral atrophy, psychiatric disorders, and thromboembolic manifestations, are predominant in the older patients. These results should prompt systematic checking of markers of vitamin B12 status, including homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, when usual causes of these manifestations are discarded in adult patients.

Abstract: Endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening infection and a serious consequence of complications during intraocular surgery or penetrating injury of which Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important etiology. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have evolved as a promising entity for developing diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers due to their involvement in intracellular communication and pathogenesis of diseases. We aimed to characterise the protein cargo of extracellular vesicles, isolated from a murine (C57BL/6) model of P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis by LC-MS/MS at 24 h post infection (p.i). EVs were extracted by ultracentrifugation, characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and western blotting with tetraspannin markers, CD9 and CD81 and quantified by the ExoCet quantification kit. Multiplex ELISA was performed to estimate the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ and IL-1β. Proteomic analysis identified 2010 proteins (FDR ≤0.01) in EVs from infected mice eyes, of which 137 were differentially expressed (P-value ≤ 0.05). A total of 101 proteins were upregulated and 36 were downregulated. Additionally, 43 proteins were exclusive to infection set. KEGG and Gene Ontology revealed, Focal adhesion, Phagosome pathway, Complement cascade and IL-17 signalling pathway are crucial upregulated pathways involving proteins such as Tenascin, caveolin 1, caveolin 2, glutamine synthetase, microtubule-associated protein, C1, C8 and IL-17. Tenascin and caveolins are known to suppress anti-inflammatory cytokines further exacerbating the disease. The result of this study provides insight into the global extracellular vesicle proteome of P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis with their functional correlation and distinctive pattern of expression and tenascin, caveolin 1 and caveolin 2 are attractive biomarkers for P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subset of breast cancer with an adverse prognosis and significant tumor heterogeneity. Here, we extract quantitative radiomic features from contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images to construct a breast cancer radiomic dataset (n = 860) and a TNBC radiogenomic dataset (n = 202). We develop and validate radiomic signatures that can fairly differentiate TNBC from other breast cancer subtypes and distinguish molecular subtypes within TNBC. A radiomic feature that captures peritumoral heterogeneity is determined to be a prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (p = 0.01) and overall survival (p = 0.004) in TNBC. Combined with the established matching TNBC transcriptomic and metabolomic data, we demonstrate that peritumoral heterogeneity is associated with immune suppression and upregulated fatty acid synthesis in tumor samples. Collectively, this multi-omic dataset serves as a useful public resource to promote precise subtyping of TNBC and helps to understand the biological significance of radiomics.

Abstract: Hemangioma (HA) is a neoplastic disease derived from vascular endothelial cells. Recently, SASH1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role and regulatory mechanism of SASH1 in HA. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expressions of SASH1, TRAF6 and EZH2 in HA tissues and cell lines. CCK-8, cell cycle, apoptosis, wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the effects of SASH1 and EZH2 exerted on HA cells. The immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays validated the regulation of SASH1 on TRAF6 and EZH2 ubiquitination. The results showed that SASH1 and EZH2 were highly expressed in HA tissues and cell lines, while TRAF6 was downregulated. SASH1 knockdown inhibited HemECs proliferation, migration, as well as invasion, and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, while EZH2 overexpression reversed these effects. Interestingly, the knockdown of SASH1 enhanced TRAF6 expression but suppressed EZH2 expression in HemECs. And the ubiquitination of EZH2 and TRAF6 was regulated by SASH1. Generally, SASH1 knockdown inhibited TRAF6 ubiquitination to destabilize EZH2. SASH1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target during HA progression.

We found that deletion of Eed decreased the number of upper-layer neurons but not deeper-layer neurons starting at E16.5. Transcriptomic and genomic occupancy analyses revealed that the epigenetic states of a group of cortical neurogenesis-related genes were altered in Eed knockout forebrains, followed by a decrease of H3K27me3 and an increase of H3K27ac marks within the promoter regions. The switching of H3K27me3 to H3K27ac modification promoted the recruitment of RNA-Pol2, thereby enhancing its expression level. The small molecule activator SAG or Ptch1 knockout for activating Hedgehog signaling can partially rescue aberrant cortical neurogenesis. Taken together, we proposed a novel EED-Gli3-Gli1 regulatory axis that is critical for embryonic brain development.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic genome activation (EGA) is critical for embryonic development. However, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of human EGA is still incomplete. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are an established model for studying developmental processes, but they resemble epiblast and are sub-optimal for modeling EGA. DUX4 regulates human EGA by inducing cleavage-stage-specific genes, while it also induces cell death. We report here that a short-pulsed expression of DUX4 in primed hESCs activates an EGA-like gene expression program in up to 17% of the cells, retaining cell viability. These DUX4-induced cells resembled eight-cell stage blastomeres and were named induced blastomere-like (iBM) cells. The iBM cells showed marked reduction of POU5F1 protein, as previously observed in mouse two-cell-like cells. Finally, the iBM cells were successfully enriched using an antibody against NaPi2b (SLC34A2), which is expressed in human blastomeres. The iBM cells provide an improved model system to study human EGA transcriptome.

Abstract: Summary
Fiber photometry is an emerging technique for recording fluorescent sensor activity in the brain. However, significant hemoglobin absorption artifacts in fiber photometry data may be misinterpreted as sensor activity changes. Because hemoglobin exists widely in the brain, and its concentration varies temporally, such artifacts could impede the accuracy of photometry recordings. Here we present use of spectral photometry and computational methods to quantify photon absorption effects by using activity-independent fluorescence signals, which can be used to derive oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration changes. Although these changes are often temporally delayed compared with the fast-responding fluorescence spikes, we found that erroneous interpretation may occur when examining pharmacology-induced sustained changes and that sometimes hemoglobin absorption could flip the GCaMP signal polarity. We provide hemoglobin-based correction methods to restore fluorescence signals and compare our results with other commonly used approaches. We also demonstrated the utility of spectral fiber photometry for delineating regional differences in hemodynamic response functions.

Abstract: Mutation-associated neoantigens are key targets of tumor-specific T cells and thus play a major role in driving responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in tumors with high mutational burden. However, only a small number of mutated peptides are actually presented by MHC molecules and only a minority can induce T cell responses. In addition, the recognition of these neoantigens by T cells is limited by the level of expression of the mutated gene product in the tumor cells. Preclinical studies have shown that radiation can convert the irradiated tumor into an in situ vaccine, leading to the priming of tumor-specific T cells and to the rejection of otherwise ICB-resistant tumors. There is now pre-clinical and clinical evidence that radiation can upregulate the expression of genes containing immunogenic mutations and expose them to the immune system. Therefore, the identification of neoantigens upregulated by radiation could help to predict which patients might benefit from treatment with combinations of radiotherapy and ICB and could also be incorporated into personalized neoantigen vaccination strategies. In this chapter, we present the pipeline that we used to identify relevant radiation-upregulated neoantigens in a poorly immunogenic mouse model of metastatic breast cancer.

Abstract: Depression is a high-incidence mental illness that seriously affects human health. AQP4 has been reported to be closely associated with depression, while the underlying mechanism is still unclear. This work aimed to investigate the functional role of AQP4 in depression. Depression mouse model was constructed by administration of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). We found that AQP4 was highly expressed in the hippocampal tissues of CSDS mice. AQP4 knockdown alleviated depression and enhanced the expression of NR2B and PSD95 in CSDS mice. Moreover, primary hippocampal neurons were treated with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) to induce neuron injury. AQP4 overexpression repressed cell viability and promoted apoptosis of NMDA-treated primary hippocampal neurons. AQP4 up-regulation repressed the expression of NR2B (surface), and enhanced the expression of NR2B (intracellular), P-NR2B, CaMK II and CK2 in the NMDA-treated primary hippocampal neurons. The influence conferred by AQP4 up-regulation was abolished by KN-93 (CaMK II inhibitor) or TBB (CK2 inhibitor) treatment. Rapamycin treatment enhanced the expression of NR2B (surface), and repressed the expression of AQP4, NR2B (intracellular) and P-NR2B in the primary hippocampal neurons by activating autophagy. The activated autophagy alleviated depression in CSDS mice by repressing AQP4 expression. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that autophagy ameliorated depression by repressing AQP4 expression in mice, and AQP4 knockdown promoted membrane trafficking of NR2B and inhibited phosphorylation of NR2B via CaMK II/CK2 pathway. Thus, our work suggests that AQP4 may be a promising molecular target for the development of antidepressant drugs.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated protein in human cancer. The majority of these mutations are missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of p53. Restoring p53 tumor suppressor function could have a major impact on the therapy for a wide range of cancers. Here we report a virtual screening approach that identified several small molecules with p53 reactivation activities. The UCI-LC0023 compound series was studied in detail and was shown to bind p53, induce a conformational change in mutant p53, restore the ability of p53 hotspot mutants to associate with chromatin, reestablish sequence-specific DNA binding of a p53 mutant in a reconstituted in vitro system, induce p53-dependent transcription programs, and prevent progression of tumors carrying mutant p53, but not p53null or p53WT alleles. Our study demonstrates feasibility of a computation-guided approach to identify small molecule corrector drugs for p53 hotspot mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) provide great opportunities for mechanistic dissection of human cardiac pathophysiology; however, hiPSC-CMs remain immature relative to the adult heart. To identify novel signaling pathways driving the maturation process during heart development, we analyzed published transcriptional and epigenetic datasets from hiPSC-CMs and prenatal and postnatal human hearts. These analyses revealed that several components of the MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways are downregulated in the postnatal heart. Here, we show that dual inhibition of these pathways for only 5 days significantly enhances the maturation of day 30 hiPSC-CMs in many domains: hypertrophy, multinucleation, metabolism, T-tubule density, calcium handling, and electrophysiology, many equivalent to day 60 hiPSC-CMs. These data indicate that the MAPK/PI3K/AKT pathways are involved in cardiomyocyte maturation and provide proof of concept for the manipulation of key signaling pathways for optimal hiPSC-CM maturation, a critical aspect of faithful in vitro modeling of cardiac pathologies and subsequent drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteriophages are potent therapeutics against biohazardous bacteria, which rapidly develop multidrug resistance. However, routine administration of phage therapy is hampered by a lack of rapid production, safe bioengineering, and detailed characterization of phages. Thus, we demonstrate a comprehensive cell-free platform for personalized production, transient engineering, and proteomic characterization of a broad spectrum of phages. Using mass spectrometry, we validated hypothetical and non-structural proteins and could also monitor the protein expression during phage assembly. Notably, a few microliters of a one-pot reaction produced effective doses of phages against enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), Yersinia pestis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. By co-expressing suitable host factors, we could extend the range of cell-free production to phages targeting gram-positive bacteria. We further introduce a non-genomic phage engineering method, which adds functionalities for only one replication cycle. In summary, we expect this cell-free methodology to foster reverse and forward phage engineering and customized production of clinical-grade bacteriophages.

Abstract: Summary
Constitutive activation of plant immunity is detrimental to plant growth and development. Here, we uncover the role of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in fine-tuning the balance of plant immunity and growth. We find that a lncRNA termed salicylic acid biogenesis controller 1 (SABC1) suppresses immunity and promotes growth in healthy plants. SABC1 recruits the polycomb repressive complex 2 to its neighboring gene NAC3, which encodes a NAC transcription factor, to decrease NAC3 transcription via H3K27me3. NAC3 activates the transcription of isochorismate synthase 1 (ICS1), a key enzyme catalyzing salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis. SABC1 thus represses SA production and plant immunity via decreasing NAC3 and ICS1 transcriptions. Upon pathogen infection, SABC1 is downregulated to derepress plant resistance to bacteria and viruses. Together, our findings reveal lncRNA SABC1 as a molecular switch in balancing plant defense and growth by modulating SA biosynthesis.

Abstract: Due to the inflammatory responses associated with defect occurrence and materials implantation, immunoregulation has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance bone regeneration. It has been widely reported that a material could facilitate osteogenesis if it can guide macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, vice versa, a substrate will influence macrophage phenotype if it is osteoinductive. However, few studies have looked into the intercellular crosstalking directly. Herein, the compound catalpol was selected for its multiple functions to study the interactions between bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) and macrophages. This iridoid glucoside exhibits excellent anti-inflammatory and osteoinductive activities. The effects of catalpol on mediating M1/M2 polarization of macrophages, inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, promoting osteogenesis and angiogenesis were systematically investigated to correlate the biological responses of BMSCs and macrophages. To extend its in vivo application, the catalpol was then loaded onto an electrospun polylactide/gelatin composite fibrous mesh and subcutaneously implanted to evaluate the local inflammation and ectopic osteogenesis. The results revealed that the functions of catalpol displayed in modulating cellular behaviors are via cell paracrine to strengthen intercellular crosstalking, hence demonstrating that catalpol itself could serve as a promising bioactive stimulator for bone tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Blastocyst complementation denotes a technique that aims to generate organs, tissues, or cell types in animal chimeras via injection of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into genetically compromised blastocyst-stage embryos. Here, we report on successful complementation of the male germline in adult chimeras following injection of mouse or rat PSCs into mouse blastocysts carrying a mutation in Tsc22d3, an essential gene for spermatozoa production. Injection of mouse PSCs into Tsc22d3-Knockout (KO) blastocysts gave rise to intraspecies chimeras exclusively embodying PSC-derived functional spermatozoa. In addition, injection of rat embryonic stem cells (rESCs) into Tsc22d3-KO embryos produced interspecies mouse-rat chimeras solely harboring rat spermatids and spermatozoa capable of fertilizing oocytes. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we deconstructed rat spermatogenesis occurring in a mouse-rat chimera testis. Collectively, this study details a method for exclusive xenogeneic germ cell production in vivo, with implications that may extend to rat transgenesis, or endangered animal species conservation efforts.

Abstract: Ubiquitin binding enzyme E2S (UBE2S) is a member of ubiquitin binding enzyme family involved in a variety of biological functions, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and regulation of the ubiquitination of proteins, which are closely correlated with the development of various tumors. However, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains unknown. In this study, we found that UBE2S was upregulated in GC tissues and cells. Further, its high expression positively correlated with the tumor stage and indicated a poor prognosis. Knockout of UBE2S by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated strategy suppressed the growth of GC in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, RNA-Seq-based transcriptome analysis and tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis was performed for exploring the underlying mechanism. The multi-omics and verification results showed that UBE2S knockout-induced apoptosis and proliferation inhibition of GC cells was related to upregulation of FAS and the activation of the FAS-mediated apoptotic pathway. Moreover, a negative correlation between UBE2S and FAS expression was observed in GC tissue samples. Finally, the ubiquitination assay confirmed that knockout of UBE2S might activate endogenous FAS by inhibiting ubiquitination and degradation of p53 in GC cells. Collectively, UBE2S is expected to be a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for GC.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient quantitative assays for measurement of viral replication and infectivity are indispensable for future endeavors to develop prophylactic or therapeutic antiviral drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. We developed a SARS-CoV-2 cell-cell transmission assay that provides a rapid and quantitative readout to assess SARS-CoV-2 spike hACE2 interaction in the absence of pseudotyped particles or live virus. We established two well-behaved stable cell lines, which demonstrated a remarkable correlation with standard cell-free viral pseudotyping for inhibition by convalescent sera, small-molecule drugs, and murine anti-spike monoclonal antibodies. The assay is rapid, reliable, and highly reproducible, without a requirement for any specialized research reagents or laboratory equipment and should be easy to adapt for use in most investigative and clinical settings. It can be effectively used or modified for high-throughput screening for compounds and biologics that interfere with virus-cell binding and entry to complement other neutralization assays currently in use.

Abstract: Background
Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome with both high morbidity and mortality. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of AKI is still largely unknown. The role of SENP1 in AKI is unclear, while one of its substrates, HIF-1α possesses nephroprotective effect in AKI. Herein, this study aimed to reveal the role of SENP1/HIF-1α axis in AKI by using both cell and animal models.
Methods
We investigated the effects of AKI on SENP1 expression using clinical samples, and cisplatin-induced AKI model based on mice or HK-2 cells. The influence of SENP1 knockdown or over-expression on cisplatin-induced AKI was studied in vitro and in vivo. Following the exploration of the change in HIF-1α expression brought by AKI, the synergistic effects of SENP1 knockdown and HIF-1α over-expression on AKI were examined.
Results
The results showed the up-regulation of SENP1 in clinical specimens, as well as cell and animal models. The knockdown or over-expression of SENP1 in HK-2 cells could promote or inhibit AKI through regulating cell apoptosis, respectively. Moreover, SENP1+/− mice suffered from much more serious AKI compared with mice in wild type group. Furthermore, we found that HIF-1α over-expression could attenuate the promoted cell apoptosis as well as AKI induced by SENP1 knockdown. Conclusions: we showed that SENP1 provided protection for kidney in AKI via regulating cell apoptosis and through the regulation of HIF-1α. This study could benefit for the understanding of the pathogenesis of AKI and provide potential therapeutic target for AKI treatment.

Abstract: Introduction
The interaction between activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) and macrophages is central to liver fibrosis development. The cargo contained within aHSC exosomes (aHSC-EXOs) and how aHSC-EXOs affect macrophage function is poorly understood.
Methods
RNA from aHSC-EXOs was separated into small (<200-basepairs) and large (≥200-basepairs) RNA species, transfected into macrophages, and macrophage IL-6 and TNFα mRNA expression and protein secretion measured. Next generation sequencing was performed on EXOs from rat quiescent and aHSCs and human aHSCs. aHSCs were transfected with siRNA against ectodysplasin-A (EDA), EXOs collected, and their effect on macrophage function analyzed. Human cirrhotic liver was analyzed for EDA mRNA expression and compared to non-tumor liver (NTL).
Results
Transfection with large RNA from aHSC-EXOs stimulated macrophage IL-6 and TNFα mRNA expression and protein secretion. EDA mRNA was highly expressed in aHSCs and transfection of aHSCs with EDA-siRNA decreased aHSC-EXO EDA mRNA and blunted the effect of aHSC-EXOs on macrophage function (IL-6/TNFα expression and macrophage migration). Human cirrhotic liver exhibited high EDA mRNA compared to NTL.
Conclusions
HSC activation leads to altered EXO mRNA/miRNA profiles with aHSC-EXOs mRNAs exerting a dominant role in altering macrophage function. Ectodysplasin-A mRNA is an important component in aHSC-EXOs in regulating macrophage function.

We present a low-cost, do-it-yourself system for complex mammalian cell culture under dynamically changing medium formulations by integrating conventional multi-well tissue culture plates with simple microfluidic control and system automation. We demonstrate the generation of complex concentration profiles, enabling the investigation of sophisticated input-response relations. We further apply our automated cell-culturing platform to the dynamic stimulation of two widely employed stem-cell-based in vitro models for early mammalian development: the conversion of naive mouse embryonic stem cells into epiblast-like cells and mouse 3D gastruloids. Performing automated medium-switch experiments, we systematically investigate cell fate commitment along the developmental trajectory toward mouse epiblast fate and examine symmetry-breaking, germ layer formation, and cardiac differentiation in mouse 3D gastruloids as a function of time-varying Wnt pathway activation. With these proof-of-principle examples, we demonstrate a highly versatile and scalable tool that can be adapted to specific research questions, experimental demands, and model systems.

Abstract: Summary
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins are epigenetic regulators that govern a wide variety of cellular events. With a role in cancer formation, HDAC inhibitors have emerged as anti-cancer therapeutics. Among the eleven metal-dependent class I, II, and IV HDAC proteins targeted by inhibitor drugs, class IIa HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9 harbor low deacetylase activity and are hypothesized to be “reader” proteins, which bind to post-translationally acetylated lysine. However, evidence linking acetyllysine binding to a downstream functional event is lacking. Here, we report for the first time that HDAC4, -5, and -7 dissociated from corepressor NCoR in the presence of an acetyllysine-containing peptide, consistent with reader function. Documenting the biological consequences of this possible reader function, mutation of a critical acetylation site regulated androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activation function through HDAC7-NCoR-HDAC3 dissociation. The data document the first evidence consistent with epigenetic-reader functions of class IIa HDAC proteins.

Abstract: Summary
There is a need for safe and effective platform vaccines to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other infectious diseases. In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2/3 trial, we evaluate the safety and efficacy of a multi-dose Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 and other infectious disease in a COVID-19-unvaccinated, at-risk-community-based cohort. The at-risk population is made of up of adults with type 1 diabetes. We enrolled 144 subjects and randomized 96 to BCG and 48 to placebo. There were no dropouts over the 15-month trial. A cumulative incidence of 12.5% of placebo-treated and 1% of BCG-treated participants meets criteria for confirmed COVID-19, yielding an efficacy of 92%. The BCG group also displayed fewer infectious disease symptoms and lesser severity and fewer infectious disease events per patient, including COVID-19. There were no BCG-related systemic adverse events. BCG’s broad-based infection protection suggests that it may provide platform protection against new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and other pathogens.

Abstract: Cancer-associated fibroblasts secreted exosomes (CAFs-exo) are important for tumor carcinogenesis and chemoresistance, but its underlying mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not yet been clarified. In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of CAFs-exo cricN4BP2L2 on the proliferation, apoptosis, stemness and chemoresistance of LoVo cells. We found that CAFs-exo promoted the oxaliplatin resistance and stemness of LoVo cells, while inhibited the LoVo cell apoptosis. Moreover, knockdown of cricN4BP2L2 in CAFs-exo inhibited the oxaliplatin resistance and stemness characteristics of LoVo cells. Mechanistically, cricN4BP2L2 regulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis by binding to EIF4A3. Rescue experiments proved that CAFs-derived exosomal cricN4BP2L2 promoted CRC cells stemness and oxaliplatin resistance by upregulating EIF4A3. Moreover, in vivo experiments showed that depletion of cricN4BP2L2 suppressed CRC tumorigenesis growth. In conclusion, CAFs-exo cricN4BP2L2 promoted the CRC cells stemness and oxaliplatin resistance through EIF4A3/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

Abstract: The Ser/Thr-protein phosphatase PP1 (PP1) is a positive regulator of the androgen receptor (AR), which suggests major roles for PP1 in prostate carcinogenesis. However, studies dedicated to the characterization of PP1 in PCa are currently scarce. Here we analyzed the expression and localization of the PP1 catalytic (PP1c) isoforms in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate tissue samples, as well as in PCa cell lines. We also analyzed well-characterized PCa cohorts to determine their transcript levels, identify genetic alterations, and assess promoter methylation of PP1c-coding genes. We found that PP-1A was upregulated and relocalized towards the nucleus in PCa and that PPP1CA was frequently amplified in PCa, particularly in advanced stages. PP-1B was downregulated in PCa but upregulated in a subset of tumors with AR amplification. PP-1G transcript levels were found to be associated with Gleason score. PP1c-coding genes were rarely mutated in PCa and were not prone to regulation by promoter methylation. Protein phosphorylation, on the other hand, might be an important regulatory mechanism of PP1c isoforms' activity. Altogether, our results suggest differential expression, localization, and regulation of PP1c isoforms in PCa and support the need for investigating isoform-specific roles in prostate carcinogenesis in future studies.
