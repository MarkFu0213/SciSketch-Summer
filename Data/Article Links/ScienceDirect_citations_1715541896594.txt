Abstract: Summary
Autophagy, a homeostatic process whereby eukaryotic cells target cytoplasmic cargo for degradation, plays a broad role in health and disease states. Here we screened the TRIM family for roles in autophagy and found that half of TRIMs modulated autophagy. In mechanistic studies, we show that TRIMs associate with autophagy factors and act as platforms assembling ULK1 and Beclin 1 in their activated states. Furthermore, TRIM5α acts as a selective autophagy receptor. Based on direct sequence-specific recognition, TRIM5α delivered its cognate cytosolic target, a viral capsid protein, for autophagic degradation. Thus, our study establishes that TRIMs can function both as regulators of autophagy and as autophagic cargo receptors, and reveals a basis for selective autophagy in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
Although common cancer hallmarks are well established, lineage-restricted oncogenes remain less understood. Here, we report an inherent dependency of melanoma cells on the small GTPase RAB7, identified within a lysosomal gene cluster that distinguishes this malignancy from over 35 tumor types. Analyses in human cells, clinical specimens, and mouse models demonstrated that RAB7 is an early-induced melanoma driver whose levels can be tuned to favor tumor invasion, ultimately defining metastatic risk. Importantly, RAB7 levels and function were independent of MITF, the best-characterized melanocyte lineage-specific transcription factor. Instead, we describe the neuroectodermal master modulator SOX10 and the oncogene MYC as RAB7 regulators. These results reveal a unique wiring of the lysosomal pathway that melanomas exploit to foster tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian sex determination initiates in the fetal gonad with specification of bipotential precursor cells into male Sertoli cells or female granulosa cells. This choice was long presumed to be irreversible, but genetic analysis in the mouse recently revealed that sexual fates must be maintained throughout life. Somatic cells in the testis or ovary, even in adults, can be induced to transdifferentiate to their opposite-sex equivalents by loss of a single transcription factor, DMRT1 in the testis or FOXL2 in the ovary. Here, we investigate what mechanism DMRT1 prevents from triggering transdifferentiation. We find that DMRT1 blocks testicular retinoic acid (RA) signaling from activating genes normally involved in female sex determination and ovarian development and show that inappropriate activation of these genes can drive sexual transdifferentiation. By preventing activation of potential feminizing genes, DMRT1 allows Sertoli cells to participate in RA signaling, which is essential for reproduction, without being sexually reprogrammed.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogens play a major role in the modulation of energy balance through central and peripheral actions. Here, we demonstrate that central action of estradiol (E2) inhibits AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) selectively in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH), leading to activation of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) through the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in a feeding-independent manner. Genetic activation of AMPK in the VMH prevented E2-induced increase in BAT-mediated thermogenesis and weight loss. Notably, fluctuations in E2 levels during estrous cycle also modulate this integrated physiological network. Together, these findings demonstrate that E2 regulation of the VMH AMPK-SNS-BAT axis is an important determinant of energy balance and suggest that dysregulation in this axis may account for the common changes in energy homeostasis and obesity linked to dysfunction of the female gonadal axis.

Abstract: Summary
Conditional gene knockout animals are valuable tools for studying the mechanisms underlying cell and developmental biology. We developed a conditional knockout strategy by spatiotemporally manipulating the expression of an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, CRISPR-Cas9, in Caenorhabditis elegans somatic cell lineages. We showed that this somatic CRISPR-Cas9 technology provides a quick and efficient approach to generate conditional knockouts in various cell types at different developmental stages. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this method outperforms our recently developed somatic TALEN technique and enables the one-step generation of multiple conditional knockouts. By combining these techniques with live-cell imaging, we showed that an essential embryonic gene, Coronin, which is associated with human neurobehavioral dysfunction, regulates actin organization and cell morphology during C. elegans postembryonic neuroblast migration and neuritogenesis. We propose that the somatic CRISPR-Cas9 platform is uniquely suited for conditional gene editing-based biomedical research.

EZH2-Mediated Inactivation of IFN-γ-JAK-STAT1 Signaling Is an Effective Therapeutic Target in MYC-Driven Prostate Cancer,

Abstract: Summary
Although small-molecule targeting of EZH2 appears to be effective in lymphomas carrying EZH2 activating mutations, finding similar approaches to target EZH2-overexpressing epithelial tumors remains challenging. In MYC-driven, but not PI3K-driven prostate cancer, we show that interferon-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) is directly repressed by EZH2 in a MYC-dependent manner and is downregulated in a subset of metastatic prostate cancers. EZH2 knockdown restored the expression of IFNGR1 and, when combined with IFN-γ treatment, led to strong activation of IFN-JAK-STAT1 tumor-suppressor signaling and robust apoptosis. Pharmacologic depletion of EZH2 by the histone-methylation inhibitor DZNep mimicked the effects of EZH2 knockdown on IFNGR1 induction and delivered a remarkable synergistic antitumor effect with IFN-γ. In contrast, although they efficiently depleted histone Lysine 27 trimethylation, EZH2 catalytic inhibitors failed to mimic EZH2 depletion. Thus, EZH2-inactivated IFN signaling may represent a therapeutic target, and patients with advanced prostate cancer driven by MYC may benefit from the combination of EZH2 and IFN-γ-targeted therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Redox-mediated posttranslational modifications represent a molecular switch that controls major mechanisms of cell function. Nitric oxide (NO) can mediate redox reactions via S-nitrosylation, representing transfer of an NO group to a critical protein thiol. NO is known to modulate neurogenesis and neuronal survival in various brain regions in disparate neurodegenerative conditions. However, a unifying molecular mechanism linking these phenomena remains unknown. Here, we report that S-nitrosylation of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors acts as a redox switch to inhibit both neurogenesis and neuronal survival. Structure-based analysis reveals that MEF2 dimerization creates a pocket, facilitating S-nitrosylation at an evolutionally conserved cysteine residue in the DNA binding domain. S-Nitrosylation disrupts MEF2-DNA binding and transcriptional activity, leading to impaired neurogenesis and survival in vitro and in vivo. Our data define a molecular switch whereby redox-mediated posttranslational modification controls both neurogenesis and neurodegeneration via a single transcriptional signaling cascade.

Abstract: Summary
Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common cancer in adult eyes. Approximately 80% of UMs harbor somatic activating mutations in GNAQ or GNA11 (encoding Gq or G11, respectively). Herein, we show in both cell culture and human tumors that cancer-associated Gq/11 mutants activate YAP, a major effector of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway that is also regulated by G protein-coupled receptor signaling. YAP mediates the oncogenic activity of mutant Gq/11 in UM development, and the YAP inhibitor verteporfin blocks tumor growth of UM cells containing Gq/11 mutations. This study reveals an essential role of the Hippo-YAP pathway in Gq/11-induced tumorigenesis and suggests YAP as a potential drug target for UM patients carrying mutations in GNAQ or GNA11.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (α-syn) into Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) is a major hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with LBs (DLB). Recent studies showed that synthetic preformed fibrils (pffs) recruit endogenous α-syn and induce LB/LN pathology in vitro and in vivo, thereby implicating propagation and cell-to-cell transmission of pathological α-syn as mechanisms for the progressive spread of LBs/LNs. Here, we demonstrate that α-syn monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reduce α-syn pff-induced LB/LN formation and rescue synapse/neuron loss in primary neuronal cultures by preventing both pff uptake and subsequent cell-to-cell transmission of pathology. Moreover, intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of mAb specific for misfolded α-syn into nontransgenic mice injected intrastriatally with α-syn pffs reduces LB/LN pathology, ameliorates substantia nigra dopaminergic neuron loss, and improves motor impairments. We conclude that α-syn antibodies could exert therapeutic effects in PD/DLB by blocking entry of pathological α-syn and/or its propagation in neurons.

Abstract: Summary
During development, neurons are constantly refining their connections in response to changes in activity. Experience-dependent plasticity is a key form of synaptic plasticity, involving changes in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) accumulation at synapses. Here, we report a critical role for the AMPAR auxiliary subunit stargazin in this plasticity. We show that stargazin is functional at the retinogeniculate synapse and that in the absence of stargazin, the refinement of the retinogeniculate synapse is specifically disrupted during the experience-dependent phase. Importantly, we found that stargazin expression and phosphorylation increased with visual deprivation and led to reduced AMPAR rectification at the retinogeniculate synapse. To test whether stargazin plays a role in homeostatic plasticity, we turned to cultured neurons and found that stargazin phosphorylation is essential for synaptic scaling. Overall, our data reveal an important role for stargazin in regulating AMPAR abundance and composition at glutamatergic synapses during homeostatic and experience-dependent plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
PLK4 was identified as a promising therapeutic target through a systematic approach that combined RNAi screening with gene expression analysis in human breast cancers and cell lines. A drug discovery program culminated in CFI-400945, a potent and selective PLK4 inhibitor. Cancer cells treated with CFI-400945 exhibit effects consistent with PLK4 kinase inhibition, including dysregulated centriole duplication, mitotic defects, and cell death. Oral administration of CFI-400945 to mice bearing human cancer xenografts results in the significant inhibition of tumor growth at doses that are well tolerated. Increased antitumor activity in vivo was observed in PTEN-deficient compared to PTEN wild-type cancer xenografts. Our findings provide a rationale for the clinical evaluation of CFI-400945 in patients with solid tumors, in particular those deficient in PTEN.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal metabolism provides essential nutrients to enable embryonic development. However, both mother and embryo produce reactive metabolites that can damage DNA. Here we discover how the embryo is protected from these genotoxins. Pregnant mice lacking Aldh2, a key enzyme that detoxifies reactive aldehydes, cannot support the development of embryos lacking the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway gene Fanca. Remarkably, transferring Aldh2−/−Fanca−/− embryos into wild-type mothers suppresses developmental defects and rescues embryonic lethality. These rescued neonates have severely depleted hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, indicating that despite intact maternal aldehyde catabolism, fetal Aldh2 is essential for hematopoiesis. Hence, maternal and fetal aldehyde detoxification protects the developing embryo from DNA damage. Failure of this genome preservation mechanism might explain why birth defects and bone marrow failure occur in Fanconi anemia, and may have implications for fetal well-being in the many women in Southeast Asia that are genetically deficient in ALDH2.

Abstract: Summary
Clustering of immunoreceptors upon association with multivalent ligands triggers important responses including phagocytosis, secretion of cytokines, and production of immunoglobulins. We applied single-molecule detection and tracking methods to study the factors that control the mobility and clustering of phagocytic Fcγ receptors (FcγR). While the receptors exist as monomers in resting macrophages, two distinct populations were discernible based on their mobility: some diffuse by apparent free motion, while others are confined within submicron boundaries that reduce the frequency of spontaneous collisions. Src-family and Syk kinases determine the structure of the actin cytoskeleton, which is fenestrated, accounting for the heterogeneous diffusion of the FcγR. Stimulation of these kinases during phagocytosis induces reorganization of the cytoskeleton both locally and distally in a manner that alters receptor mobility and clustering, generating a feedback loop that facilitates engagement of FcγR at the tip of pseudopods, directing the progression of phagocytosis.

Abstract: Calcium signaling has a versatile role in many important cellular functions. Despite its importance, regulation of calcium signaling in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) has not been explored extensively. Our previous study revealed that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) enabled BMSCs to generate calcium signal upon stimulation by dopamine, KCl and glutamate. Concurrently, cAMP transiently activated the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in BMSCs. Activity of CREB can be modulated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase signaling pathway, however, whether the calcium signaling observed in cAMP-induced BMSCs requires CREB has not been investigated. In an effort to uncover the role of CREB in the generation of calcium signaling in response to modulators such as dopamine and KCl, we knocked down CREB activity in BMSCs. Our study indicated that BMSCs, but not its close relative fibroblasts, are responsive to dopamine and KCl after cAMP treatment. Calcium signal elicited by dopamine depends, in part, on calcium influx whereas that elicited by KCl depends completely on calcium influx. Knock-down of CREB activity significantly reduced or abolished the cAMP-induced calcium response, and reintroducing a constitutively active CREB partially restored the calcium response.

Abstract: Summary
It is becoming increasingly clear that transcription factors operate in complex networks through thousands of genomic binding sites, many of which bind several transcription factors. However, the extent and mechanisms of crosstalk between transcription factors at these hotspots remain unclear. Using a combination of advanced proteomics and genomics approaches, we identify ∼12,000 transcription factor hotspots (∼400 bp) in the early phase of adipogenesis, and we find evidence of both simultaneous and sequential binding of transcription factors at these regions. We demonstrate that hotspots are highly enriched in large super-enhancer regions (several kilobases), which drive the early adipogenic reprogramming of gene expression. Our results indicate that cooperativity between transcription factors at the level of hotspots as well as super-enhancers is very important for enhancer activity and transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, hotspots and super-enhancers constitute important regulatory hubs that serve to integrate external stimuli on chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
Immune surveillance and host defense depend on the precisely regulated trafficking of lymphocytes. Integrin α4β7 mediates lymphocyte homing to the gut through its interaction with mucosal vascular address in cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1). α4β7 also binds vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which is expressed in other tissues. To maintain the tissue specificity of lymphocyte homing, α4β7 must distinguish one ligand from the other. Here, we demonstrate that α4β7 is activated by different chemokines in a ligand-specific manner. CCL25 stimulation promotes α4β7-mediated lymphocyte adhesion to MAdCAM-1 but suppresses adhesion to VCAM-1, whereas CXCL10 stimulation has the opposite effect. Using separate pathways, CCL25 and CXCL10 stimulate differential phosphorylation states of the β7 tail and distinct talin and kindlin-3 binding patterns, resulting in different binding affinities of MAdCAM-1 and VCAM-1 to α4β7. Thus, our findings provide a mechanism for lymphocyte traffic control through the unique ligand-specific regulation of integrin adhesion by different chemokines.

Abstract: The localization of specific claw beta-proteins among the 40 total corneous beta-proteins present in the lizard Anolis carolinensis is not known. The hardness of claws likely depends on glycine–cysteine-rich beta-proteins content, as suggested by previous immunoblot studies. Previous studies have indicated that glycine–cysteine-rich corneous beta-proteins in addition to cysteine-rich alpha-keratins are present in the claw. In order to detect at the ultrastructural level the presence of claw-specific corneous proteins immunofluorescence and electron microscopy immunogold have been utilized. More intense immunoreactivity is obtained for the HgGC3 beta-protein while less intense immunolabeling is seen for HgGC10 and HgG5 beta-proteins and no labeling for the cysteine-rich beta-protein HgC1. The HgGC3 beta-protein appears the prevalent type present in the claw and its numerous cysteines likely form intermolecular disulphide bonds while glycine contributes hydrophobic properties to the corneous material. Other antibodies tagging the core-box and pre-core box regions of beta-proteins label with less intensity the corneous layer. The presence of cysteine-rich alpha-keratins with high homology to some human hair keratins in the dorsal part of the claw suggests that HgGC3-like beta-proteins form numerous disulphide bonds with the larger alpha-keratins giving rise to the hard corneous material of the claw.

Mechanism of Cytokinetic Contractile Ring Constriction in Fission Yeast,

Abstract: Summary
Cytokinesis involves constriction of a contractile actomyosin ring. The mechanisms generating ring tension and setting the constriction rate remain unknown because the organization of the ring is poorly characterized, its tension was rarely measured, and constriction is coupled to other processes. To isolate ring mechanisms, we studied fission yeast protoplasts, in which constriction occurs without the cell wall. Exploiting the absence of cell wall and actin cortex, we measured ring tension and imaged ring organization, which was dynamic and disordered. Computer simulations based on the amounts and biochemical properties of the key proteins showed that they spontaneously self-organize into a tension-generating bundle. Together with rapid component turnover, the self-organization mechanism continuously reassembles and remodels the constricting ring. Ring constriction depended on cell shape, revealing that the ring operates close to conditions of isometric tension. Thus, the fission yeast ring sets its own tension, but other processes set the constriction rate.

Abstract: Summary
AMPK and mTOR play principal roles in governing metabolic programs; however, mechanisms underlying the coordination of the two inversely regulated kinases remain unclear. In this study we found, most surprisingly, that the late endosomal/lysosomal protein complex v-ATPase-Ragulator, essential for activation of mTORC1, is also required for AMPK activation. We also uncovered that AMPK is a residential protein of late endosome/lysosome. Under glucose starvation, the v-ATPase-Ragulator complex is accessible to AXIN/LKB1 for AMPK activation. Concurrently, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of Ragulator toward RAG is inhibited by AXIN, causing dissociation from endosome and inactivation of mTORC1. We have thus revealed that the v-ATPase-Ragulator complex is also an initiating sensor for energy stress and meanwhile serves as an endosomal docking site for LKB1-mediated AMPK activation by forming the v-ATPase-Ragulator-AXIN/LKB1-AMPK complex, thereby providing a switch between catabolism and anabolism. Our current study also emphasizes a general role of late endosome/lysosome in controlling metabolic programs.

Abstract: Summary
Heterochromatin is required to restrict aberrant expression of retrotransposons, but it remains poorly defined due to the underlying repeat-rich sequences. We dissected Suv39h-dependent histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) by genome-wide ChIP sequencing in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Refined bioinformatic analyses of repeat subfamilies indicated selective accumulation of Suv39h-dependent H3K9me3 at interspersed repetitive elements that cover ∼5% of the ESC epigenome. The majority of the ∼8,150 intact long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), but only a minor fraction of the >1.8 million degenerate and truncated LINEs/ERVs, are enriched for Suv39h-dependent H3K9me3. Transcriptional repression of intact LINEs and ERVs is differentially regulated by Suv39h and other chromatin modifiers in ESCs but governed by DNA methylation in committed cells. These data provide a function for Suv39h-dependent H3K9me3 chromatin to specifically repress intact LINE elements in the ESC epigenome.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage can result in a transient cell-cycle arrest or lead to permanent cell-cycle withdrawal. Here we show that the decision to irreversibly withdraw from the cell cycle is made within a few hours following damage in G2 cells. This permanent arrest is dependent on induction of p53 and p21, resulting in the nuclear retention of Cyclin B1. This rapid response is followed by the activation of the APC/CCdh1 (the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its coactivator Cdh1) several hours later. Inhibition of APC/CCdh1 activity fails to prevent cell-cycle withdrawal, whereas preventing nuclear retention of Cyclin B1 does allow cells to remain in cycle. Importantly, transient induction of p53 in G2 cells is sufficient to induce senescence. Taken together, these results indicate that a rapid and transient pulse of p53 in G2 can drive nuclear retention of Cyclin B1 as the first irreversible step in the onset of senescence.

Abstract: Summary
The eukaryotic epigenome is shaped by the genome topology in three-dimensional space. Dynamic reversible variations in this epigenome structure directly influence the transcriptional responses to developmental cues. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) APOLO is transcribed by RNA polymerases II and V in response to auxin, a phytohormone controlling numerous facets of plant development. This dual APOLO transcription regulates the formation of a chromatin loop encompassing the promoter of its neighboring gene PID, a key regulator of polar auxin transport. Altering APOLO expression affects chromatin loop formation, whereas RNA-dependent DNA methylation, active DNA demethylation, and Polycomb complexes control loop dynamics. This dynamic chromatin topology determines PID expression patterns. Hence, the dual transcription of a lincRNA influences local chromatin topology and directs dynamic auxin-controlled developmental outputs on neighboring genes. This mechanism likely underscores the adaptive success of plants in diverse environments and may be widespread in eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an enigmatic disease associated with epigenetic alterations in the subtelomeric heterochromatin of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat. Each repeat unit encodes DUX4, a gene that is normally silent in most tissues. Besides muscular loss, most patients suffer retinal vascular telangiectasias. To generate an animal model, we introduced a doxycycline-inducible transgene encoding DUX4 and 3′ genomic DNA into a euchromatic region of the mouse X chromosome. Without induction, DUX4 RNA was expressed at low levels in many tissues and animals displayed a variety of unexpected dominant leaky phenotypes, including male-specific lethality. Remarkably, rare live-born males expressed DUX4 RNA in the retina and presented a retinal vascular telangiectasia. By using doxycycline to induce DUX4 expression in satellite cells, we observed impaired myogenesis in vitro and in vivo. This mouse model, which shows pathologies due to FSHD-related D4Z4 sequences, is likely to be useful for testing anti-DUX4 therapies in FSHD.

Abstract: Proteomic analysis is helpful in identifying cancer-associated proteins that are differentially expressed and fragmented that can be annotated as dysregulated networks and pathways during metastasis. To examine meta-static process in lung cancer, we performed a proteomics study by label-free quantitative analysis and N-terminal analysis in 2 human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines with disparate metastatic potentials—NCI-H1703 (primary cell, stage I) and NCI-H1755 (metastatic cell, stage IV). We identified 2130 proteins, 1355 of which were common to both cell lines. In the label-free quantitative analysis, we used the NSAF normalization method, resulting in 242 differential expressed proteins. For the N-terminal proteome analysis, 325 N-terminal peptides, including 45 novel fragments, were identified in the 2 cell lines. Based on two proteomic analysis, 11 quantitatively expressed proteins and 8 N-terminal peptides were enriched for the focal adhesion pathway. Most proteins from the quantitative analysis were upregulated in metastatic cancer cells, whereas novel fragment of CRKL was detected only in primary cancer cells. This study increases our understanding of the NSCLC metastasis proteome.

Cytosolic Quality Control of Mislocalized Proteins Requires RNF126 Recruitment to Bag6,

Abstract: Summary
Approximately 30% of eukaryotic proteins contain hydrophobic signals for localization to the secretory pathway. These proteins can be mislocalized in the cytosol due to mutations in their targeting signals, certain stresses, or intrinsic inefficiencies in their translocation. Mislocalized proteins (MLPs) are protected from aggregation by the Bag6 complex and degraded by a poorly characterized proteasome-dependent pathway. Here, we identify the ubiquitin ligase RNF126 as a key component of the MLP degradation pathway. In vitro reconstitution and fractionation studies reveal that RNF126 is the primary Bag6-dependent ligase. RNF126 is recruited to the N-terminal Ubl domain of Bag6 and preferentially ubiquitinates juxtahydrophobic lysine residues on Bag6-associated clients. Interfering with RNF126 recruitment in vitro prevents ubiquitination, and RNF126 depletion in cells partially stabilizes a Bag6 client. Bag6-dependent ubiquitination can be recapitulated with purified components, paving the way for mechanistic analyses of downstream steps in this cytosolic quality control pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) rely on environmental signals provided by the neurogenic niche for their proper function. However, little is known about the initial steps of niche establishment, as embryonic radial glia transition to postnatal NSCs. Here, we identify Gli3 repressor (Gli3R), a component of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, as a critical factor controlling both cell-type specification and structural organization of the developing SVZ. We demonstrate that Gli3R expressed in radial glia temporally regulates gp130/STAT3 signaling at the transcriptional level to suppress glial characteristics in differentiating ependymal cells. In addition, Gli3R maintains the proper level of Numb in ependymal cells to allow localization of cell adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and E-cadherin. Thus, our findings reveal a role for Gli3R as a mediator of niche establishment and provide insights into the conditions required for proper SVZ neurogenic niche formation.

Abstract: Summary
In the process of neuronal wiring, axons derived from the same functional group typically extend together, resulting in fascicle formation. How these axons communicate with one another remains largely unknown. Here, we show that protocadherin-17 (Pcdh17) supports this group extension by recruiting actin polymerization regulators to interaxonal contact sites. Pcdh17 is expressed by a subset of amygdala neurons, and it accumulates at axon-axon boundaries because of homophilic binding. Pcdh17 knockout in mice suppressed the extension of these axons. Ectopically expressed Pcdh17 altered the pattern of axon extension. In in vitro cultures, wild-type growth cones normally migrate along other axons, whereas Pcdh17 null growth cones do not. Pcdh17 recruits the WAVE complex, Lamellipodin, and Ena/VASP to cell-cell contacts, converting these sites into motile structures. We propose that, through these mechanisms, Pcdh17 maintains the migration of growth cones that are in contact with other axons, thereby supporting their collective extension.

Abstract: The digestive tract is the largest endocrine organ in the body; the distribution pattern of endocrine cells varies with different pathological and physiological states. The aim of the present study was to investigate the distributed density of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), gastrin (GAS), somatostatin (SS) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) immunoreactive (IR) cells in the digestive tract of Alligator sinensis during the active and hibernating period by immunohistochemical (IHC) method. The results indicated that 5-HT-IR cells were distributed throughout the entire digestive tract, which were most predominant in duodenum and jejunum. The density increased significantly in stomach and duodenum during hibernation. GAS-IR cells were limited in small stomach and small intestine. The density decreased significantly in small stomach during hibernation, while increased in duodenum. What's more, most of the endocrine cells in duodenum were generally spindle shaped with long cytoplasmic processes ending in the lumen during hibernation. SS-IR cells were limited in stomach and small stomach. The density increased in stomach while decreased in small stomach during hibernation, meanwhile, fewer IR cells occurred in small intestine. VIP-IR cells occurred in stomach and small stomach. The density decreased in small stomach, while increased in stomach during hibernation. These results indicated that the endocrine cells in different parts of digestive tract varied differently during hibernation, their changes were adaptive response to the hibernation.

Hydrogen sulphide triggers VEGF-induced intracellular Ca2+ signals in human endothelial cells but not in their immature progenitors,

Abstract: Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a newly discovered gasotransmitter that regulates multiple steps in VEGF-induced angiogenesis. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) is central to endothelial proliferation and may be triggered by both VEGF and H2S. Albeit VEGFR-2 might serve as H2S receptor, the mechanistic relationship between VEGF- and H2S-induced Ca2+ signals in endothelial cells is unclear. The present study aimed at assessing whether and how NaHS, a widely employed H2S donor, stimulates pro-angiogenic Ca2+ signals in Ea.hy926 cells, a suitable surrogate for mature endothelial cells, and human endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). We found that NaHS induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i in Ea.hy926 cells. NaHS-induced Ca2+ signals in Ea.hy926 cells did not require extracellular Ca2+ entry, while they were inhibited upon pharmacological blockade of the phospholipase C/inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) signalling pathway. Moreover, the Ca2+ response to NaHS was prevented by genistein, but not by SU5416, which selectively inhibits VEGFR-2. However, VEGF-induced Ca2+ signals were suppressed by dl-propargylglycine (PAG), which blocks the H2S-producing enzyme, cystathionine γ-lyase. Consistent with these data, VEGF-induced proliferation and migration were inhibited by PAG in Ea.hy926 cells, albeit NaHS alone did not influence these processes. Conversely, NaHS elevated [Ca2+]i only in a modest fraction of circulating EPCs, whereas neither VEGF-induced Ca2+ oscillations nor VEGF-dependent proliferation were affected by PAG. Therefore, H2S-evoked elevation in [Ca2+]i is essential to trigger the pro-angiogenic Ca2+ response to VEGF in mature endothelial cells, but not in their immature progenitors.

Abstract: The use of synovial fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (SFMSCs) obtained from patients with degenerative arthropathy may serve as an alternative therapeutic strategy in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). For treatment of OA and RA patients, autologous transplantation of differentiated MSCs has several beneficial effects for cartilage regeneration including immunomodulatory activity. In this study, we induced chondrogenic differentiation of SFMSCs by inhibiting protein kinase A (PKA) with a small molecule and microRNA (miRNA). Chondrogenic differentiation was confirmed by PCR and immunocytochemistry using probes specific for aggrecan, the major cartilaginous proteoglycan gene. Absorbance of alcian blue stain to detect chondrogenic differentiation was increased in H-89 and/or miRNA-23btransfected cells. Furthermore, expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-2 was decreased in treated cells. Therefore, differentiation of SFMSCs into chondrocytes through inhibition of PKA signaling may be a therapeutic option for OA or RA patients.

Abstract: Summary
The exquisite control of growth factor function by heparan sulfate (HS) is dictated by tremendous structural heterogeneity of sulfated modifications. How specific HS structures control growth factor-dependent progenitor expansion during organogenesis is unknown. We isolated KIT+ progenitors from fetal salivary glands during a stage of rapid progenitor expansion and profiled HS biosynthetic enzyme expression. Enzymes generating a specific type of 3-O-sulfated-HS (3-O-HS) are enriched, and fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10)/FGF receptor 2b (FGFR2b) signaling directly regulates their expression. Bioengineered 3-O-HS binds FGFR2b and stabilizes FGF10/FGFR2b complexes in a receptor- and growth factor-specific manner. Rapid autocrine feedback increases 3-O-HS, KIT, and progenitor expansion. Knockdown of multiple Hs3st isoforms limits fetal progenitor expansion but is rescued with bioengineered 3-O-HS, which also increases adult progenitor expansion. Altering specific 3-O-sulfated epitopes provides a mechanism to rapidly respond to FGFR2b signaling and control progenitor expansion. 3-O-HS may expand KIT+ progenitors in vitro for regenerative therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Cell polarity in one-cell C. elegans embryos guides asymmetric cell division and cell-fate specification. Shortly after fertilization, embryos establish two antagonistic cortical domains of PAR proteins. Here, we find that the conserved polarity factor PAR-5 regulates PAR domain size in a dose-dependent manner. Using quantitative imaging and controlled genetic manipulation, we find that PAR-5 protein levels reflect the cumulative output of three mRNA isoforms with different translational efficiencies mediated by their 3′ UTRs. 3′ UTR selection is regulated, influencing PAR-5 protein abundance. Alternative splicing underlies the selection of par-5 3′ UTR isoforms. 3′ UTR splicing is enhanced by the SR protein kinase SPK-1, and accordingly, SPK-1 is required for wild-type PAR-5 levels and PAR domain size. Precise regulation of par-5 isoform selection is essential for polarization when the posterior PAR network is compromised. Together, strict control of PAR-5 protein levels and feedback from polarity to par-5 3′ UTR selection confer robustness to embryo polarization.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple conserved mechanisms sense nutritional conditions and coordinate metabolic changes in the whole organism. We unravel a role for the Drosophila homolog of p53 (Dp53) in the fat body (FB; a functional analog of vertebrate adipose and hepatic tissues) in starvation adaptation. Under nutrient deprivation, FB-specific depletion of Dp53 accelerates consumption of major energy stores and reduces survival rates of adult flies. We show that Dp53 is regulated by the microRNA (miRNA) machinery and miR-305 in a nutrition-dependent manner. In well-fed animals, TOR signaling contributes to miR-305-mediated inhibition of Dp53. Nutrient deprivation reduces the levels of miRNA machinery components and leads to Dp53 derepression. Our results uncover an organism-wide role for Dp53 in nutrient sensing and metabolic adaptation and open up avenues toward understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying p53 activation under nutrient deprivation.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian cell homeostasis during starvation depends on initiation of autophagy by endoplasmic reticulum-localized phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) synthesis. Formation of double-membrane autophagosomes that engulf cytosolic components requires the LC3-conjugating Atg12–5-16L1 complex. The molecular mechanisms of Atg12–5-16L1 recruitment and significance of PtdIns(3)P synthesis at autophagosome formation sites are unknown. By identifying interacting partners of WIPIs, WD-repeat PtdIns(3)P effector proteins, we found that Atg16L1 directly binds WIPI2b. Mutation experiments and ectopic localization of WIPI2b to plasma membrane show that WIPI2b is a PtdIns(3)P effector upstream of Atg16L1 and is required for LC3 conjugation and starvation-induced autophagy through recruitment of the Atg12–5-16L1 complex. Atg16L1 mutants, which do not bind WIPI2b but bind FIP200, cannot rescue starvation-induced autophagy in Atg16L1-deficient MEFs. WIPI2b is also required for autophagic clearance of pathogenic bacteria. WIPI2b binds the membrane surrounding Salmonella and recruits the Atg12–5-16L1 complex, initiating LC3 conjugation, autophagosomal membrane formation, and engulfment of Salmonella.

Abstract: Summary
We have analyzed the yeast replicative lifespan of a large number of open reading frame (ORF) deletions. Here, we report that strains lacking genes SGF73, SGF11, and UBP8 encoding SAGA/SLIK complex histone deubiquitinase module (DUBm) components are exceptionally long lived. Strains lacking other SAGA/SALSA components, including the acetyltransferase encoded by GCN5, are not long lived; however, these genes are required for the lifespan extension observed in DUBm deletions. Moreover, the SIR2-encoded histone deacetylase is required, and we document both a genetic and physical interaction between DUBm and Sir2. A series of studies assessing Sir2-dependent functions lead us to propose that DUBm strains are exceptionally long lived because they promote multiple prolongevity events, including reduced rDNA recombination and altered silencing of telomere-proximal genes. Given that ataxin-7, the human Sgf73 ortholog, causes the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 7, our findings indicate that the genetic and epigenetic interactions between DUBm and SIR2 will be relevant to neurodegeneration and aging.

Abstract: Summary
Complement is traditionally thought of as a proinflammatory effector mechanism of antitumor immunity. However, complement is also important for effective clearance of apoptotic cells, which can be an anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic process. We show that localized fractionated radiation therapy (RT) of subcutaneous murine lymphoma results in tumor cell apoptosis and local complement activation. Cotreatment of mice with tumor-targeted complement inhibition markedly improved therapeutic outcome of RT, an effect linked to early increases in apoptotic cell numbers and increased inflammation. Improved outcome was dependent on an early neutrophil influx and was characterized by increased numbers of mature dendritic cells and the subsequent modulation of T cell immunity. Appropriate complement inhibition may be a promising strategy to enhance a mainstay of treatment for cancer.

Abstract: Dynamic features of Ca2+ interactions with transport and regulatory sites control the Ca2+-fluxes in mammalian Na+/Ca2+(NCX) exchangers bearing the Ca2+-binding regulatory domains on the cytosolic 5L6 loop. The crystal structure of Methanococcus jannaschii NCX (NCX_Mj) may serve as a template for studying ion-transport mechanisms since NCX_Mj does not contain the regulatory domains. The turnover rate of Na+/Ca2+ exchange (kcat=0.5±0.2s−1) in WT–NCX_Mj is 103–104 times slower than in mammalian NCX. In NCX_Mj, the intrinsic equilibrium (Kint) for bidirectional Ca2+ movements (defined as the ratio between the cytosolic and extracellular Km of Ca2+/Ca2+ exchange) is asymmetric, Kint=0.15±0.5. Therefore, the Ca2+ movement from the cytosol to the extracellular side is ∼7-times faster than in the opposite direction, thereby representing a stabilization of outward-facing (extracellular) access. This intrinsic asymmetry accounts for observed differences in the cytosolic and extracellulr Km values having a physiological relevance. Bidirectional Ca2+ movements are also asymmetric in mammalian NCX. Thus, the stabilization of the outward-facing access along the transport cycle is a common feature among NCX orthologs despite huge differences in the ion-transport kinetics. Elongation of the cytosolic 5L6 loop in NCX_Mj by 8 or 14 residues accelerates the ion transport rates (kcat) ∼10 fold, while increasing the Kint values 100–250-fold (Kint=15–35). Therefore, 5L6 controls both the intrinsic equilibrium and rates of bidirectional Ca2+ movements in NCX proteins. Some additional structural elements may shape the kinetic variances among phylogenetically distant NCX variants, although the intrinsic asymmetry (Kint) of bidirectional Ca2+ movements seems to be comparable among evolutionary diverged NCX variants.

Abstract: Summary
During central nervous system (CNS) development, progenitors typically divide asymmetrically, renewing themselves while budding off daughter cells with more limited proliferative potential. Variation in daughter cell proliferation has a profound impact on CNS development and evolution, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We find that Drosophila embryonic neural progenitors (neuroblasts) undergo a programmed daughter proliferation mode switch, from generating daughters that divide once (type I) to generating neurons directly (type 0). This typeI>0 switch is triggered by activation of Dacapo (mammalian p21CIP1/p27KIP1/p57Kip2) expression in neuroblasts. In the thoracic region, Dacapo expression is activated by the temporal cascade (castor) and the Hox gene Antennapedia. In addition, castor, Antennapedia, and the late temporal gene grainyhead act combinatorially to control the precise timing of neuroblast cell-cycle exit by repressing Cyclin E and E2f. This reveals a logical principle underlying progenitor and daughter cell proliferation control in the Drosophila CNS.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic control of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) function is increasingly understood; however, less is known about the interactions specifying the embryonic hematopoietic niche. Here, we report that 17β-estradiol (E2) influences production of runx1+ HSPCs in the AGM region by antagonizing VEGF signaling and subsequent assignment of hemogenic endothelial (HE) identity. Exposure to exogenous E2 during vascular niche development significantly disrupted flk1+ vessel maturation, ephrinB2+ arterial identity, and specification of scl+ HE by decreasing expression of VEGFAa and downstream arterial Notch-pathway components; heat shock induction of VEGFAa/Notch rescued E2-mediated hematovascular defects. Conversely, repression of endogenous E2 activity increased somitic VEGF expression and vascular target regulation, shifting assignment of arterial/venous fate and HE localization; blocking E2 signaling allowed venous production of scl+/runx1+ cells, independent of arterial identity acquisition. Together, these data suggest that yolk-derived E2 sets the ventral boundary of hemogenic vascular niche specification by antagonizing the dorsal-ventral regulatory limits of VEGF.

Abstract: Summary
Leptin is a critical regulator of metabolism, which acts on brain receptors (Lepr) to reduce energy intake and increase energy expenditure. Some of the cellular pathways mediating leptin’s anorectic actions are identified, but those mediating the thermogenic effects have proven more difficult to decipher. We define a population of neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) containing the RFamide PrRP, which is activated by leptin. Disruption of Lepr selectively in these cells blocks thermogenic responses to leptin and causes obesity. A separate population of leptin-insensitive PrRP neurons in the brainstem is required, instead, for the satiating actions of the gut-derived hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). Global deletion of PrRP (in a loxSTOPlox-PrRP mouse) results in obesity and attenuated responses to leptin and CCK. Cre-recombinase-mediated reactivation of PrRP in brainstem rescues the anorectic actions of CCK, but reactivation in the hypothalamus is required to re-establish the thermogenic effect of leptin.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic cells compartmentalize biochemical processes in different organelles, often relying on metabolic cycles to shuttle reducing equivalents across intracellular membranes. NADPH serves as the electron carrier for the maintenance of redox homeostasis and reductive biosynthesis, with separate cytosolic and mitochondrial pools providing reducing power in each respective location. This cellular organization is critical for numerous functions but complicates analysis of metabolic pathways using available methods. Here we develop an approach to resolve NADP(H)-dependent pathways present within both the cytosol and the mitochondria. By tracing hydrogen in compartmentalized reactions that use NADPH as a cofactor, including the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate by mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes, we can observe metabolic pathway activity in these distinct cellular compartments. Using this system we determine the direction of serine/glycine interconversion within the mitochondria and cytosol, highlighting the ability of this approach to resolve compartmentalized reactions in intact cells.

Regulation of endogenous and heterologous Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ currents by pH,

Abstract: Deviations from physiological pH (∼pH 7.2) as well as altered Ca2+ signaling play important roles in immune disease and cancer. One of the most ubiquitous pathways for cellular Ca2+ influx is the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) or Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC), which is activated upon depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. We here show that extracellular and intracellular changes in pH regulate both endogenous ICRAC in Jurkat T lymphocytes and RBL2H3 cells, and heterologous ICRAC in HEK293 cells expressing the molecular components STIM1/2 and Orai1/2/3 (CRACM1/2/3). We find that external acidification suppresses, and alkalization facilitates IP3-induced ICRAC. In the absence of IP3, external alkalization did not elicit endogenous ICRAC but was able to activate heterologous ICRAC in HEK293 cells expressing Orai1/2/3 and STIM1 or STIM2. Similarly, internal acidification reduced IP3-induced activation of endogenous and heterologous ICRAC, while alkalization accelerated its activation kinetics without affecting overall current amplitudes. Mutation of two aspartate residues to uncharged alanine amino acids (D110/112A) in the first extracellular loop of Orai1 significantly attenuated both the inhibition of ICRAC by external acidic pH as well as its facilitation by alkaline conditions. We conclude that intra- and extracellular pH differentially regulates ICRAC. While intracellular pH might affect aggregation and/or binding of STIM to Orai, external pH seems to modulate ICRAC through its channel pore, which in Orai1 is partially mediated by residues D110 and D112.

Abstract: Summary
MutS protein homolog 2 (MSH2) is a key DNA mismatch repair protein. It forms the MSH2-MSH6 (MutSα) and MSH2-MSH3 (MutSβ) heterodimers, which help to ensure genomic integrity. MutSα not only recognizes and repairs mismatched nucleotides but also recognizes DNA adducts induced by DNA-damaging agents, and triggers cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Loss or depletion of MutSα from cells leads to microsatellite instability (MSI) and resistance to DNA damage. Although the level of MutSα can be reduced by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, the detailed mechanisms of this regulation remain elusive. Here we report that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) sequentially deacetylates and ubiquitinates MSH2, leading to MSH2 degradation. In addition, HDAC6 significantly reduces cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and decreases cellular DNA mismatch repair activities by downregulation of MSH2. Overall, these findings reveal a mechanism by which proper levels of MutSα are maintained.

Abstract: Summary
There are currently no approved targeted therapies for advanced KRAS mutant (KRASMT) colorectal cancer (CRC). Using a unique systems biology approach, we identified JAK1/2-dependent activation of STAT3 as the key mediator of resistance to MEK inhibitors in KRASMT CRC in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses identified acute increases in c-MET activity following treatment with MEK inhibitors in KRASMT CRC models, which was demonstrated to promote JAK1/2-STAT3-mediated resistance. Furthermore, activation of c-MET following MEK inhibition was found to be due to inhibition of the ERK-dependent metalloprotease ADAM17, which normally inhibits c-MET signaling by promoting shedding of its endogenous antagonist, soluble “decoy” MET. Most importantly, pharmacological blockade of this resistance pathway with either c-MET or JAK1/2 inhibitors synergistically increased MEK-inhibitor-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo in KRASMT models, providing clear rationales for the clinical assessment of these combinations in KRASMT CRC patients.

Abstract: Summary
Heterogeneous anabolic capacity in cell populations can trigger a phenomenon known as cell competition, through which less active cells are eliminated. Cell competition has been induced experimentally in stem/precursor cell populations in insects and mammals and takes place endogenously in early mouse embryonic cells. Here, we show that cell competition can be efficiently induced in mouse cardiomyocytes by mosaic overexpression of Myc during both gestation and adult life. The expansion of the Myc-overexpressing cardiomyocyte population is driven by the elimination of wild-type cardiomyocytes. Importantly, this cardiomyocyte replacement is phenotypically silent and does not affect heart anatomy or function. These results show that the capacity for cell competition in mammals is not restricted to stem cell populations and suggest that stimulated cell competition has potential as a cardiomyocyte-replacement strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranscriptional maturation is a critical step in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis that determines mature miRNA levels. In addition to core components (Drosha and DGCR8 [DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8]) in the microprocessor, regulatory RNA-binding proteins may confer the specificity for recruiting and processing of individual primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). Here, we identify DDX1 as a regulatory protein that promotes the expression of a subset of miRNAs, including five members in the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family and four miRNAs in an eight-miRNA signature of a mesenchymal ovarian cancer subtype. A majority of DDX1-dependent miRNAs are induced after DNA damage. This induction is facilitated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated phosphorylation of DDX1. Inhibiting DDX1 promotes ovarian tumor growth and metastasis in a syngeneic mouse model. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that low DDX1 levels are associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with serous ovarian cancer. These findings suggest that DDX1 is a key modulator in miRNA maturation and ovarian tumor suppression.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanistic roles for many lncRNAs are poorly understood, in part because their direct interactions with genomic loci and proteins are difficult to assess. Using a method to purify endogenous RNAs and their associated factors, we mapped the genomic binding sites for two highly expressed human lncRNAs, NEAT1 and MALAT1. We show that NEAT1 and MALAT1 localize to hundreds of genomic sites in human cells, primarily over active genes. NEAT1 and MALAT1 exhibit colocalization to many of these loci, but display distinct gene body binding patterns at these sites, suggesting independent but complementary functions for these RNAs. We also identified numerous proteins enriched by both lncRNAs, supporting complementary binding and function, in addition to unique associated proteins. Transcriptional inhibition or stimulation alters localization of NEAT1 on active chromatin sites, implying that underlying DNA sequence does not target NEAT1 to chromatin, and that localization responds to cues involved in the transcription process.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which the major Polycomb group (PcG) complexes PRC1 and PRC2 are recruited to target sites in vertebrate cells are not well understood. Building on recent studies that determined a reciprocal relationship between DNA methylation and Polycomb activity, we demonstrate that, in methylation-deficient embryonic stem cells (ESCs), CpG density combined with antagonistic effects of H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 redirects PcG complexes to pericentric heterochromatin and gene-rich domains. Surprisingly, we find that PRC1-linked H2A monoubiquitylation is sufficient to recruit PRC2 to chromatin in vivo, suggesting a mechanism through which recognition of unmethylated CpG determines the localization of both PRC1 and PRC2 at canonical and atypical target sites. We discuss our data in light of emerging evidence suggesting that PcG recruitment is a default state at licensed chromatin sites, mediated by interplay between CpG hypomethylation and counteracting H3 tail modifications.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental property of cellular processes is to maintain homeostasis despite varying internal and external conditions. Within the membrane transport apparatus, variations in membrane fluxes from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex are balanced by opposite fluxes from the Golgi to the ER to maintain homeostasis between the two organelles. Here we describe a molecular device that balances transport fluxes by integrating transduction cascades with the transport machinery. Specifically, ER-to-Golgi transport activates the KDEL receptor at the Golgi, which triggers a cascade that involves Gs and adenylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase isoforms and then PKA activation and results in the phosphorylation of transport machinery proteins. This induces retrograde traffic to the ER and balances transport fluxes between the ER and Golgi. Moreover, the KDEL receptor activates CREB1 and other transcription factors that upregulate transport-related genes. Thus, a Golgi-based control system maintains transport homeostasis through both signaling and transcriptional networks.

Abstract: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder that manifests in susceptible individuals exposed to volatile anaesthetics. Over 400 variants in the ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) have been reported but relatively few have been definitively associated with susceptibility to MH. This is largely due to the technical challenges of demonstrating abnormal Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This study focuses on the R2452W variant and its functional characterisation with the aim of classifying this variant as MH causative. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with full-length human wildtype or R2452W mutant RYR1 cDNA. In addition, B-lymphoblastoid cells from blood and myoblasts propagated from in vitro contracture tests were extracted from patients positive for the R2452W variant. All cell lines generated were loaded with the ratiometric dye Fura-2 AM, stimulated with the RYR1-specific agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol and Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum was monitored by fluorescence emission. All cells expressing the RYR1 R2452W variant show a significantly higher Ca2+ release in response to the agonist, 4-chloro-m-cresol, compared to cells expressing RYR1 WT. These results indicate that the R2452W variant results in a hypersensitive ryanodine receptor 1 and suggest that the R2452W variant in the ryanodine receptor 1 is likely to be causative of MH.

Abstract: Summary
The small GTPase Rac1 orchestrates actin-dependent remodeling essential for numerous cellular processes including synapse development. While precise spatiotemporal regulation of Rac1 is necessary for its function, little is known about the mechanisms that enable Rac1 activators (GEFs) and inhibitors (GAPs) to act in concert to regulate Rac1 signaling. Here, we identify a regulatory complex composed of a Rac-GEF (Tiam1) and a Rac-GAP (Bcr) that cooperate to control excitatory synapse development. Disruption of Bcr function within this complex increases Rac1 activity and dendritic spine remodeling, resulting in excessive synaptic growth that is rescued by Tiam1 inhibition. Notably, EphB receptors utilize the Tiam1-Bcr complex to control synaptogenesis. Following EphB activation, Tiam1 induces Rac1-dependent spine formation, whereas Bcr prevents Rac1-mediated receptor internalization, promoting spine growth over retraction. The finding that a Rac-specific GEF/GAP complex is required to maintain optimal levels of Rac1 signaling provides an important insight into the regulation of small GTPases.

Abstract: Summary
We used high-speed optogenetic mapping technology to examine the spatial organization of local inhibitory circuits formed by cerebellar interneurons. Transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 exclusively in molecular layer interneurons allowed us to focally photostimulate these neurons, while measuring resulting responses in postsynaptic Purkinje cells. This approach revealed that interneurons converge upon Purkinje cells over a broad area and that at least seven interneurons form functional synapses with a single Purkinje cell. The number of converging interneurons was reduced by treatment with gap junction blockers, revealing that electrical synapses between interneurons contribute substantially to the spatial convergence. Remarkably, gap junction blockers affected convergence in sagittal slices, but not in coronal slices, indicating a sagittal bias in electrical coupling between interneurons. We conclude that electrical synapse networks spatially coordinate interneurons in the cerebellum and may also serve this function in other brain regions.

Abstract: Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) serve as electrical pacemakers in the rabbit urethra. Pacemaking activity in ICC results from spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ waves that rely on Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. The purpose of this study was to investigate if the action of protein kinase A (PKA) affected the generation of Ca2+ waves in ICC. Intracellular [Ca2+] was measured in fluo-4 loaded ICC, freshly isolated from the rabbit urethra using a Nipkow spinning disc confocal microscope. Application of the PKA inhibitor H-89 (10μM) significantly inhibited the generation of spontaneous Ca2+ waves in ICC and this was associated with a significant decrease in the ER Ca2+ load, measured with 10mM caffeine responses. Ca2+ waves could be rescued in the presence of H-89 by stimulating ryanodine receptors (RyRs) with 1mM caffeine but not by activation of inositol 1,4,5 tri-phosphate receptors (IP3Rs) with 10μM phenylephrine. Increasing intracellular PKA with the cAMP agonists forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP failed to yield an increase in Ca2+ wave activity. We conclude that PKA may be maximally active under basal conditions in ICC and that inhibition of PKA with H-89 leads to a decreased ER Ca2+ load sufficient to inactivate IP3Rs but not RyRs.

Abstract: In birds and mammals the metabolic response to fasting has been studied and can be characterized by three consecutive phases reflecting metabolic and physiological adjustments. An effective way to minimize energy expenditure during food scarcity is to decrease the mass of the organs. As the digestive system is metabolically expensive to maintain, the small intestine and the liver are the most affected organs. We evaluated the effects of phase III starvation on the mass of the different organs and histological parameters on house sparrows, a small non-migrant bird. In a short period of time (34h) we observed a larger reduction in the digestive organ mass when compared to the mass of the body and non-alimentary tissues. Furthermore, the intestinal mass was proportionally more reduced than its length and nominal surface area. A reduction on the intestinal mucosal layer also resulted in a shortening of villus (length and thickness) and crypt depth. Moreover, the morphology of the enterocytes changed from cylindrical to cubical, suggesting that the surface exposed to the lumen was conserved. This may indicate an adaptive response to the moment of refeeding. The nominal surface area/body mass remained constant in both groups and several histological parameters were reduced, suggesting that starving induces the atrophy of the small intestine. However, the goblet cells were conserved after fasting indicating a protective tendency.

Abstract: In previous works, we have shown that L-type voltage-operated calcium channels, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAr), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and cytochrome b5 reductase (Cb5R) co-localize within the same lipid rafts-associated nanodomains in mature cerebellar granule neurons (CGN). In this work, we show that the calcium transport systems of the plasma membrane extruding calcium from the cytosol, plasma membrane calcium pumps (PMCA) and sodium–calcium exchangers (NCX), are also associated with these nanodomains. All these proteins were found to co-immunoprecipitate with caveolin-1 after treatment with 25mM methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a lipid rafts solubilizing agent. However, the treatment of CGN with methyl-β-cyclodextrin largely attenuated the rise of cytosolic calcium induced by l-glutamate through NMDAr. Fluorescence energy transfer imaging revealed that all of them are present in sub-microdomains of a size smaller than 200nm, with a peripheral distribution of the calcium extrusion systems PMCA and NCX. Fluorescence microscopy images analysis revealed high calcium dynamic sub-microcompartments near the plasma membrane in fura-2-loaded CGN at short times after addition of l-glutamate. In addition, the close proximity between sources of nitric oxide (nNOS) and superoxide anion (Cb5R) suggests that these nanodomains are involved in the fast and efficient cross-talk between calcium and redox signaling in neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Brown and beige/brite fats generate heat via uncoupled respiration to defend against cold. The total mass and activity of thermogenic adipose tissues are also tightly linked to systemic energy and nutrient homeostasis. Despite originating from distinct progenitors, brown and beige adipocytes acquire remarkably similar molecular and metabolic characteristics during differentiation through the action of a network of transcription factors and cofactors. How this regulatory network interfaces with long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), an emerging class of developmental regulators, remains largely unexplored. Here, we globally profiled lncRNA gene expression during thermogenic adipocyte formation and identified Brown fat lncRNA 1 (Blnc1) as a nuclear lncRNA that promotes brown and beige adipocyte differentiation and function. Blnc1 forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with transcription factor EBF2 to stimulate the thermogenic gene program. Further, Blnc1 itself is a target of EBF2, thereby forming a feedforward regulatory loop to drive adipogenesis toward thermogenic phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Disorders arising from impaired assembly of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) result in a myriad of pathologies, consistent with its unique role in linking the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain. In spite of this critical function, however, only a few factors are known to be required for SDH assembly and function. We show here that two factors, Sdh6 (SDHAF1) and Sdh7 (SDHAF3), mediate maturation of the FeS cluster SDH subunit (Sdh2/SDHB). Yeast and Drosophila lacking SDHAF3 are impaired in SDH activity with reduced levels of Sdh2. Drosophila lacking the Sdh7 ortholog SDHAF3 are hypersensitive to oxidative stress and exhibit muscular and neuronal dysfunction. Yeast studies revealed that Sdh6 and Sdh7 act together to promote Sdh2 maturation by binding to a Sdh1/Sdh2 intermediate, protecting it from the deleterious effects of oxidants. These studies in yeast and Drosophila raise the possibility that SDHAF3 mutations may be associated with idiopathic SDH-associated diseases.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation patterns are dynamically controlled by DNA methylation and active DNA demethylation, but the mechanisms of regulation of active DNA demethylation are not well understood. Through forward genetic screens for Arabidopsis mutants showing DNA hypermethylation at specific loci and increased silencing of reporter genes, we identified IDM2 (increased DNA methylation 2) as a regulator of DNA demethylation and gene silencing. IDM2 dysfunction causes DNA hypermethylation and silencing of reporter genes and some endogenous genes. These effects of idm2 mutations are similar to those of mutations in IDM1, a regulator of active DNA demethylation. IDM2 encodes an α-crystallin domain protein in the nucleus. IDM2 and IDM1 interact physically and partially colocalize at discrete subnuclear foci. IDM2 is required for the full activity of H3K18 acetylation but not H3K23 acetylation of IDM1 in planta. Our results suggest that IDM2 functions in active DNA demethylation and in antisilencing by regulating IDM1.

Abstract: Summary
Timely and selective recruitment of transcription factors to their appropriate DNA-binding sites represents a critical step in regulating gene activation; however, the regulatory strategies underlying each factor’s effective recruitment to specific promoter and/or enhancer regions are not fully understood. Here, we identify an unexpected regulatory mechanism by which promoter-specific binding, and therefore function, of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor γ (PPARγ) in adipocytes requires G protein suppressor 2 (GPS2) to prime the local chromatin environment via inhibition of the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 and stabilization of the H3K9 histone demethylase KDM4A/JMJD2. Integration of genome-wide profiling data indicates that the pioneering activity of GPS2/KDM4A is required for PPARγ-mediated regulation of a specific transcriptional program, including the lipolytic enzymes adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Hence, our findings reveal that GPS2 exerts a biologically important function in adipose tissue lipid mobilization by directly regulating ubiquitin signaling and indirectly modulating chromatin remodeling to prime selected genes for activation.

Abstract: Summary
The first lineage choice in mammalian embryogenesis is that between the trophectoderm, which gives rise to the trophoblast of the placenta, and the inner cell mass, from which is derived the embryo proper and the yolk sac. The establishment of these lineages is preceded by the inside-versus-outside positioning of cells in the early embryo and stochastic expression of key transcription factors, which is then resolved into lineage-restricted expression. The regulatory inputs that drive this restriction and how they relate to cell position are largely unknown. Here, we show an unsuspected role of Notch signaling in regulating trophectoderm-specific expression of Cdx2 in cooperation with TEAD4. Notch activity is restricted to outer cells and is able to influence positional allocation of blastomeres, mediating preferential localization to the trophectoderm. Our results show that multiple signaling inputs at preimplantation stages specify the first embryonic lineages.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor suppressor p53 regulates transcription of stress-response genes. Many p53 targets remain undiscovered because of uncertainty as to where p53 binds in the genome and the fact that few genes reside near p53-bound recognition elements (REs). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by exonuclease treatment (ChIP-exo), we associated p53 with 2,183 unsplit REs. REs were positionally constrained with other REs and other regulatory elements, which may reflect structurally organized p53 interactions. Surprisingly, stress resulted in increased occupancy of transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and RNA polymerase (Pol) II near REs, which was reduced when p53 was present. A subset associated with antisense RNA near stress-response genes. The combination of high-confidence locations for p53/REs, TFIIB/Pol II, and their changes in response to stress allowed us to identify 151 high-confidence p53-regulated genes, substantially increasing the number of p53 targets. These genes composed a large portion of a predefined DNA-damage stress-response network. Thus, p53 plays a comprehensive role in regulating the stress-response network, including regulating noncoding transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence has suggested a role for p53 activation in various age-associated conditions. Here, we identified a crucial role of endothelial p53 activation in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Endothelial expression of p53 was markedly upregulated when mice were fed a high-calorie diet. Disruption of endothelial p53 activation improved dietary inactivation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase that upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α in skeletal muscle, thereby increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and oxygen consumption. Mice with endothelial cell-specific p53 deficiency fed a high-calorie diet showed improvement of insulin sensitivity and less fat accumulation, compared with control littermates. Conversely, upregulation of endothelial p53 caused metabolic abnormalities. These results indicate that inhibition of endothelial p53 could be a novel therapeutic target to block the vicious cycle of cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranslational modifications of histones play fundamental roles in many biological functions. Specifically, histone H4-K20 methylation is critical for DNA synthesis and repair. However, little is known about how these functions are regulated by the upstream stimuli. Here, we identify a tyrosine phosphorylation site at Y72 of histone H4, which facilitates recruitment of histone methyltransferases (HMTases), SET8 and SUV4-20H, to enhance its K20 methylation, thereby promoting DNA synthesis and repair. Phosphorylation-defective histone H4 mutant is deficient in K20 methylation, leading to reduced DNA synthesis, delayed cell cycle progression, and decreased DNA repair ability. Disrupting the interaction between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and histone H4 by Y72 peptide significantly reduced tumor growth. Furthermore, EGFR expression clinically correlates with histone H4-Y72 phosphorylation, H4-K20 monomethylation, and the Ki-67 proliferation marker. These findings uncover a mechanism by which EGFR transduces signal to chromatin to regulate DNA synthesis and repair.

Abstract: In the present work we studied the distribution of YB-1 in the nuclei of mouse hepatocytes, early embryos and human skin fibroblasts with the use of light and electron microscopy. To reveal YB-1, we applied rat polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal fragment of YB-1 molecule and rabbit polyclonal antibody against full-length YB-1 molecule. YB-1 distribution patterns varied significantly in different cell types. YB-1 was found to be colocalized with RNA polymerase I in mouse hepatocytes and embryos. Besides, YB-1 was revealed in a population of Cajal bodies in 2-cell mouse embryos but not in other cells studied.

Abstract: The ubiquitous InsP3/Ca2+ signalling pathway is modulated by diverse mechanisms, i.e. feedback of Ca2+ and interactions with other signalling pathways. In the salivary glands of the blowfly Calliphora vicina, the hormone serotonin (5-HT) causes a parallel rise in intracellular [Ca2+] and [cAMP] via two types of 5-HT receptors. We have shown recently that cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) sensitizes InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. We have now identified the protein phosphatase that counteracts the effect of PKA on 5-HT-induced InsP3/Ca2+ signalling. We demonstrate that (1) tautomycin and okadaic acid, inhibitors of protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, have no effect on 5-HT-induced Ca2+ signals; (2) cyclosporin A and FK506, inhibitors of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin, cause an increase in the frequency of 5-HT-induced Ca2+ oscillations; (3) the sensitizing effect of cyclosporin A on 5-HT-induced Ca2+ responses does not involve Ca2+ entry into the cells; (4) cyclosporin A increases InsP3-dependent Ca2+ release; (5) inhibition of PKA abolishes the effect of cyclosporin A on the 5-HT-induced Ca2+ responses, indicating that PKA and calcineurin act antagonistically on the InsP3/Ca2+ signalling pathway. These findings suggest that calcineurin provides a negative feedback on InsP3/Ca2+ signalling in blowfly salivary glands, counteracting the effect of PKA and desensitizing the signalling cascade at higher 5-HT concentrations.

Abstract: During early-to-middle spermiogenesis in multicellular, internally fertilizing charalean green algae (Chara fibrosa, Chara vulgaris, Chara tomentosa, Nitella missouriensis), patterning of chromatin/nucleoplasm in developing spermatid nuclei changes from granules→fibers→contorted lamellae→condensed chromatin. Cytochemical, immunocytochemical, electrophoretic studies on C. vulgaris and C. tomentosa spermatids (Kwiatkowska, Poplonska) and amino acid analysis of protamines in Chara corallina sperm (Reynolds, Wolfe), indicate that more positively charged protamines replace histones directly during spermiogenesis, not indirectly through other intermediate transitional proteins as in internally fertilizing neogastropods and sharks with more ordered spermatid lamellae. We hypothesize that such lamellar-mediated patterning is due to liquid–liquid phase separation by spinodal decomposition. This is a spontaneous thermodynamic process that involves diffusive instability of a lamellar chromatin network, a dominant pattern repeat distance and bicontinuity of chromatin/nucleoplasm phases. C. vulgaris sperm show contorted lamellae in the posterior region, whereas C. corallina sperm display contorted peripheral lamellae and interior fibrils. Among internally fertilizing liverworts, which may have evolved from Zygnematales, mid-spermatid nuclei lack lamellae. Instead they display self-coiled chromatin rods in Blasia pusilla, contain short chromatin tubules in Haplomitrium hookeri resembling those in internally fertilizing mosses and a hornwort and indirectly replace histones with protamines in Marchantia polymorpha.

Abstract: In the myometrium SR Ca2+ depletion promotes an increase in force but unlike several other smooth muscles, there is no Ca2+ sparks-STOCs coupling mechanism to explain this. Given the importance of the control of contractility for successful parturition, we have examined, in pregnant rat myometrium, the effects of SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibition on the temporal relationship between action potentials, Ca2+ transients and force. Simultaneous recording of electrical activity, calcium and force showed that SERCA inhibition, by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA 20μM), caused time-dependent changes in excitability, most noticeably depolarization and elevations of baseline [Ca2+]i and force. At the onset of these changes there was a prolongation of the bursts of action potentials and a corresponding series of Ca2+ spikes, which increased the amplitude and duration of contractions. As the rise of baseline Ca2+ and depolarization continued a point was reached when electrical and Ca2+ spikes and phasic contractions ceased, and a maintained, tonic force and Ca2+ was produced. Lanthanum, a non-selective blocker of store-operated Ca2+ entry, but not the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (1–10μM), could abolish the maintained force and calcium. Application of the agonist, carbachol, produced similar effects to CPA, i.e. depolarization, elevation of force and calcium. A brief, high concentration of carbachol, to cause SR Ca2+ depletion without eliciting receptor-operated channel opening, also produced these results. The data obtained suggest that in pregnant rats SR Ca2+ release is coupled to marked Ca2+ entry, via store operated Ca2+ channels, leading to depolarization and enhanced electrical and mechanical activity.

Abstract: Summary
LPIN1 encodes lipin-1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to form diacylglycerol. Homozygous LPIN1 gene mutations cause severe rhabdomyolysis, and heterozygous LPIN1 missense mutations may promote statin-induced myopathy. We demonstrate that lipin-1–related myopathy in the mouse is associated with a blockade in autophagic flux and accumulation of aberrant mitochondria. Lipin-1 PAP activity is required for maturation of autolysosomes, through its activation of the protein kinase D (PKD)-Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling cascade. Statin treatment also reduces PKD activation and autophagic flux, which are compounded by diminished mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) abundance in lipin-1-haploinsufficent and -deficient muscle. Lipin-1 restoration in skeletal muscle prevents myonecrosis and statin toxicity in vivo, and activated PKD rescues autophagic flux in lipin-1-deficient cells. Our findings identify lipin-1 PAP activity as a component of the macroautophagy pathway and define the basis for lipin-1-related myopathies.

Abstract: Angiotensinogen (AGT), the precursor of angiotensin I, is known to be involved in tumor angiogenesis and associated with the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis. This study was undertaken to determine the role played by AGT in endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in tumor progression and metastasis. It was found that the number of EPC colonies formed by AGT heterozygous knockout (AGT+/−) cells was less than that formed by wild-type (WT) cells, and that the migration and tube formation abilities of AGT+/− EPCs were significantly lower than those of WT EPCs. In addition, the gene expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Flk1, angiopoietin (Ang)-1, Ang-2, Tie-2, stromal derived factor (SDF)-1, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), and of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were suppressed in AGT+/− EPCs. Furthermore, the expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and -2α were downregulated in AGT+/− early EPCs under hypoxic conditions, suggesting a blunting of response to hypoxia. Moreover, the activation of Akt/eNOS signaling pathways induced by VEGF, epithelial growth factor (EGF), or SDF-1α were suppressed in AGT+/− EPCs. In AGT+/− mice, the incorporation of EPCs into the tumor vasculature was significantly reduced, and lung tumor growth and melanoma metastasis were attenuated. In conclusion, AGT is required for hypoxia-induced vasculogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin-like SUMO system regulates gene expression, but the molecular insights into this process are incomplete. We show that the SUMO-specific isopeptidase SENP3 controls H3K4 methylation by regulating histone-modifying SET1/MLL complexes. SET1/MLL complexes are composed of a histone methyltransferase and the regulatory components WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30. MLL1/MLL2 complexes contain menin as additional component and are particularly important for the activation of HOX genes. We demonstrate that SENP3 is associated with MLL1/MLL2 complexes and catalyzes deSUMOylation of RbBP5. This is required for activation of a subset of HOX genes, including the developmental regulator DLX3. In the absence of SENP3, the association of menin and Ash2L with the DLX3 gene is impaired, leading to decreased H3K4 methylation and reduced recruitment of active RNA polymerase II. Importantly, the SENP3-DLX3 pathway dictates osteogenic differentiation of human stem cells, thus delineating the importance of balanced SUMOylation for epigenetic control of gene expression programs.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence indicates that human natural killer (NK) cells develop in secondary lymphoid tissue (SLT) through a so-called “stage 3” developmental intermediate minimally characterized by a CD34−CD117+CD94− immunophenotype that lacks mature NK cell function. This stage 3 population is heterogeneous, potentially composed of functionally distinct innate lymphoid cell (ILC) types that include interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R1)-positive, IL-22-producing ILC3s. Whether human ILC3s are developmentally related to NK cells is a subject of ongoing investigation. Here, we show that antagonism of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) or silencing of AHR gene expression promotes the differentiation of tonsillar IL-22-producing IL-1R1hi human ILC3s to CD56brightCD94+ interferon (IFN)-γ-producing cytolytic mature NK cells expressing eomesodermin (EOMES) and T-Box Protein 21 (TBX21 or TBET). Hence, we demonstrate the lineage plasticity of human ILCs by identifying AHR as a transcription factor that prevents IL-1R1hi ILC3s from differentiating into NK cells.

Abstract: Summary
Apoptosis and autophagy are distinct biological processes, each driven by a different set of protein-protein interactions, with significant crosstalk via direct interactions among apoptotic and autophagic proteins. To measure the global profile of these interactions, we adapted the Gaussia luciferase protein-fragment complementation assay (GLuc PCA), which monitors binding between proteins fused to complementary fragments of a luciferase reporter. A library encompassing 63 apoptotic and autophagic proteins was constructed for the analysis of ∼3,600 protein-pair combinations. This generated a detailed landscape of the apoptotic and autophagic modules and points of interface between them, identifying 46 previously unknown interactions. One of these interactions, between DAPK2, a Ser/Thr kinase that promotes autophagy, and 14-3-3τ, was further investigated. We mapped the region responsible for 14-3-3τ binding and proved that this interaction inhibits DAPK2 dimerization and activity. This proof of concept underscores the power of the GLuc PCA platform for the discovery of biochemical pathways within the cell death network.

Abstract: Summary
Chloroquine (CQ) has been evaluated as an autophagy blocker for cancer treatment, but it is unknown if it acts solely by inhibiting cancer cell autophagy. We report that CQ reduced tumor growth but improved the tumor milieu. By normalizing tumor vessel structure and function and increasing perfusion, CQ reduced hypoxia, cancer cell invasion, and metastasis, while improving chemotherapy delivery and response. Inhibiting autophagy in cancer cells or endothelial cells (ECs) failed to induce such effects. CQ’s vessel normalization activity relied mainly on alterations of endosomal Notch1 trafficking and signaling in ECs and was abrogated by Notch1 deletion in ECs in vivo. Thus, autophagy-independent vessel normalization by CQ restrains tumor invasion and metastasis while improving chemotherapy, supporting the use of CQ for anticancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Growth cones facilitate the repair of nervous system damage by providing the driving force for axon regeneration. Using single-neuron laser axotomy and in vivo time-lapse imaging, we show that syndecan, a heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan, is required for growth cone function during axon regeneration in C. elegans. In the absence of syndecan, regenerating growth cones form but are unstable and collapse, decreasing the effective growth rate and impeding regrowth to target cells. We provide evidence that syndecan has two distinct functions during axon regeneration: (1) a canonical function in axon guidance that requires expression outside the nervous system and depends on HS chains and (2) an intrinsic function in growth cone stabilization that is mediated by the syndecan core protein, independently of HS. Thus, syndecan is a regulator of a critical choke point in nervous system repair.

Abstract: Summary
In the early stages of amyloid formation, heterogeneous populations of oligomeric species are generated, the affinity, specificity, and nature of which may promote, inhibit, or define the course of assembly. Despite the importance of the intermolecular interactions that initiate amyloid assembly, our understanding of these events remains poor. Here, using amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic variants of β2-microglobulin, we identify the interactions that inhibit or promote fibril formation in atomic detail. The results reveal that different outcomes of assembly result from biomolecular interactions involving similar surfaces. Specifically, inhibition occurs via rigid body docking of monomers in a head-to-head orientation to form kinetically trapped dimers. By contrast, the promotion of fibrillation involves relatively weak protein association in a similar orientation, which results in conformational changes in the initially nonfibrillogenic partner. The results highlight the complexity of interactions early in amyloid assembly and reveal atomic-level information about species barriers in amyloid formation.

Abstract: The effects of quinestrol on spermatogenesis were investigated in adult male mice by daily intragastric administration of quinestrol with various doses of 5, 10, 50 and 100mg/kg body weight for 10 days. The sperm counts declined while the number of abnormal spermatozoa went up in mice treated with quinestrol. The testicular weight and seminiferous tubular area gradually declined with increasing dosages of quinestrol to 50 and 100mg/kg. Rarefied germ cells showed irregular distributions in the seminiferous tubules of mice treated with 50 and 100mg/kg quinestrol. Apoptosis was highly pronounced in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and Leydig cells. Antioxidant enzyme activities – superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase – as well as total antioxidant capacity significantly reduced, while malondialdehyde contents increased. The number of germ cells expressing caspase-3, p53, Bax and FasL significantly increased whereas cells expressing Bcl-2 significantly decreased in groups treated with 50 and 100mg/kg quinestrol compared with the control. The concentration of nitrogen monoxidum also increased significantly under these dosages. The results suggest that quinestrol stimulates oxidative stress to induce apoptosis in spermatogenic cells through the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways in adult male mice.

Abstract: Human PARP family consists of 17 members of which PARP-1 is a prominent member and plays a key role in DNA repair pathways. It has an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) encompassing the nuclear localisation signal (NLS), central automodification domain and C-terminal catalytic domain. PARP-1 accounts for majority of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymer synthesis that upon binding to numerous proteins including PARP itself modulates their activity. Reduced PARP-1 activity in ageing human samples and its deficiency leading to telomere shortening has been reported. Hence for cell survival, maintenance of genomic integrity and longevity presence of intact PARP-1 in the nucleus is paramount. Although localisation of full-length and truncated PARP-1 in PARP-1 proficient cells is well documented, subcellular distribution of PARP-1 fragments in the absence of endogenous PARP-1 is not known. Here we report the differential localisation of PARP-1 N-terminal fragment encompassing NLS in PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts by live imaging of cells transiently expressing EGFP tagged fragment. In PARP-1+/+ cells the fragment localises to the nuclei presenting a granular pattern. Furthermore, it is densely packaged in the midsections of the nucleus. In contrast, the fragment localises exclusively to the cytoplasm in PARP-1−/− cells. Flourescence intensity analysis further confirmed this observation indicating that the N-terminal fragment requires endogenous PARP-1 for its nuclear transport. Our study illustrates the trafficking role of PARP-1 independently of its enzymatic activity and highlights the possibility that full-length PARP-1 may play a key role in the nuclear transport of its siblings and other molecules.

Abstract: Summary
The role of the Hippo pathway effector YAP1 in soft tissue sarcomas is poorly defined. Here we report that YAP1 activity is elevated in human embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). In mice, sustained YAP1 hyperactivity in activated, but not quiescent, satellite cells induces ERMS with high penetrance and short latency. Via its transcriptional program with TEAD1, YAP1 directly regulates several major hallmarks of ERMS. YAP1-TEAD1 upregulate pro-proliferative and oncogenic genes and maintain the ERMS differentiation block by interfering with MYOD1 and MEF2 pro-differentiation activities. Normalization of YAP1 expression reduces tumor burden in human ERMS xenografts and allows YAP1-driven ERMS to differentiate in situ. Collectively, our results identify YAP1 as a potent ERMS oncogenic driver and a promising target for differentiation therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomes are folded, spatially organized, and regulated by epigenetic marks. How chromosomal architecture is connected to the epigenome is not well understood. We show that chromosomal architecture of Arabidopsis is tightly linked to the epigenetic state. Furthermore, we show how physical constraints, such as nuclear size, correlate with the folding principles of chromatin. We also describe a nuclear structure, termed KNOT, in which genomic regions of all five Arabidopsis chromosomes interact. These KNOT ENGAGED ELEMENT (KEE) regions represent heterochromatic islands within euchromatin. Similar to PIWI-interacting RNA clusters, such as flamenco in Drosophila, KEEs represent preferred landing sites for transposable elements, which may be part of a transposon defense mechanism in the Arabidopsis nucleus.

Cell-Autonomous Repression of Shh by Transcription Factor Pax6 Regulates Diencephalic Patterning by Controlling the Central Diencephalic Organizer,

Abstract: Summary
During development, region-specific patterns of regulatory gene expression are controlled by signaling centers that release morphogens providing positional information to surrounding cells. Regulation of signaling centers themselves is therefore critical. The size and the influence of a Shh-producing forebrain organizer, the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI), are limited by Pax6. By studying mouse chimeras, we find that Pax6 acts cell autonomously to block Shh expression in cells around the ZLI. Immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays indicate that Pax6 can bind the Shh promoter and repress its function. An analysis of chimeras suggests that many of the regional gene expression pattern defects that occur in Pax6−/− diencephalic cells result from a non-cell-autonomous position-dependent defect of local intercellular signaling. Blocking Shh signaling in Pax6−/− mutants reverses major diencephalic patterning defects. We conclude that Pax6’s cell-autonomous repression of Shh expression around the ZLI is critical for many aspects of normal diencephalic patterning.

Abstract: Summary
The RUNX genes encode transcription factors involved in development and human disease. RUNX1 and RUNX3 are frequently associated with leukemias, yet the basis for their involvement in leukemogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we show that Runx1;Runx3 double-knockout (DKO) mice exhibited lethal phenotypes due to bone marrow failure and myeloproliferative disorder. These contradictory clinical manifestations are reminiscent of human inherited bone marrow failure syndromes such as Fanconi anemia (FA), caused by defective DNA repair. Indeed, Runx1;Runx3 DKO cells showed mitomycin C hypersensitivity, due to impairment of monoubiquitinated-FANCD2 recruitment to DNA damage foci, although FANCD2 monoubiquitination in the FA pathway was unaffected. RUNX1 and RUNX3 interact with FANCD2 independently of CBFβ, suggesting a nontranscriptional role for RUNX in DNA repair. These findings suggest that RUNX dysfunction causes DNA repair defect, besides transcriptional misregulation, and promotes the development of leukemias and other cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing plays important regulatory roles during periods of physiological change. During development, a large number of genes coordinately express protein isoform transitions regulated by alternative splicing; however, the mechanisms that coordinate splicing and the functional integration of the resultant tissue-specific protein isoforms are typically unknown. Here we show that the conserved Rbfox2 RNA binding protein regulates 30% of the splicing transitions observed during myogenesis and is required for the specific step of myoblast fusion. Integration of Rbfox2-dependent splicing outcomes from RNA-seq with Rbfox2 iCLIP data identified Mef2d and Rock2 as Rbfox2 splicing targets. Restored activities of Mef2d and Rock2 rescued myoblast fusion in Rbfox2-depleted cultures, demonstrating functional cooperation of protein isoforms generated by coordinated alterative splicing. The results demonstrate that coordinated alternative splicing by a single RNA binding protein modulates transcription (Mef2d) and cell signaling (Rock2) programs to drive tissue-specific functions (cell fusion) to promote a developmental transition.

Abstract: Microfluidics can provide unique experimental tools to visualize the development of neural structures within a microscale device, which is followed by guidance of neurite growth in the axonal isolation compartment. We utilized microfluidics technology to monitor the differentiation and migration of neural cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We co-cultured hESCs with PA6 stromal cells, and isolated neural rosette-like structures, which subsequently formed neurospheres in suspension culture. Tuj1-positive neural cells, but not nestin-positive neural precursor cells (NPCs), were able to enter the microfluidics grooves (microchannels), suggesting that neural cell-migratory capacity was dependent upon neuronal differentiation stage. We also showed that bundles of axons formed and extended into the microchannels. Taken together, these results demonstrated that microfluidics technology can provide useful tools to study neurite outgrowth and axon guidance of neural cells, which are derived from human embryonic stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
CUEDC2, a CUE-domain-containing protein, modulates inflammation, but its involvement in tumorigenesis is still poorly understood. Here, we report that CUEDC2 is a key regulator of macrophage function and critical for protection against colitis-associated tumorigenesis. CUEDC2 expression is dramatically upregulated during macrophage differentiation, and CUEDC2 deficiency results in excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines. The level of CUEDC2 in macrophages is modulated by miR- 324-5p. We find that Cuedc2 KO mice are more susceptible to dextran-sodium-sulfate-induced colitis, and macrophage transplantation results suggest that the increased susceptibility results from the dysfunction of macrophages lacking CUEDC2. Furthermore, we find that Cuedc2 KO mice are more prone to colitis-associated cancer. Importantly, CUEDC2 expression is almost undetectable in macrophages in human colon cancer, and this decreased CUEDC2 expression is associated with high levels of interleukin-4 and miR-324-5p. Thus, CUEDC2 plays a crucial role in modulating macrophage function and is associated with both colitis and colon tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic evidence has implicated multiple pathways in eukaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR) downstream of mispair recognition and Mlh1-Pms1 recruitment, including Exonuclease 1 (Exo1)-dependent and -independent pathways. We identified 14 mutations in POL30, which encodes PCNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, specific to Exo1-independent MMR. The mutations identified affected amino acids at three distinct sites on the PCNA structure. Multiple mutant PCNA proteins had defects either in trimerization and Msh2-Msh6 binding or in activation of the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease that initiates excision during MMR. The latter class of mutations led to hyperaccumulation of repair intermediate Mlh1-Pms1 foci and were enhanced by an msh6 mutation that disrupted the Msh2-Msh6 interaction with PCNA. These results reveal a central role for PCNA in the Exo1-independent MMR pathway and suggest that Msh2-Msh6 localizes PCNA to repair sites after mispair recognition to activate the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease for initiating Exo1-dependent repair or for driving progressive excision in Exo1-independent repair.

Abstract: Summary
Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) gene variants are associated with increased genetic risk for schizophrenia. It is unclear whether risk haplotypes cause elevated or decreased expression of NRG1 in the brains of schizophrenia patients, given that both findings have been reported from autopsy studies. To study NRG1 functions in vivo, we generated mouse mutants with reduced and elevated NRG1 levels and analyzed the impact on cortical functions. Loss of NRG1 from cortical projection neurons resulted in increased inhibitory neurotransmission, reduced synaptic plasticity, and hypoactivity. Neuronal overexpression of cysteine-rich domain (CRD)-NRG1, the major brain isoform, caused unbalanced excitatory-inhibitory neurotransmission, reduced synaptic plasticity, abnormal spine growth, altered steady-state levels of synaptic plasticity-related proteins, and impaired sensorimotor gating. We conclude that an “optimal” level of NRG1 signaling balances excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the cortex. Our data provide a potential pathomechanism for impaired synaptic plasticity and suggest that human NRG1 risk haplotypes exert a gain-of-function effect.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear transfer to oocytes is an efficient way to transcriptionally reprogram somatic nuclei, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify a sequence of molecular events that leads to rapid transcriptional reprogramming of somatic nuclei after transplantation to Xenopus oocytes. RNA-seq analyses reveal that reprogramming by oocytes results in a selective switch in transcription toward an oocyte rather than pluripotent type, without requiring new protein synthesis. Time-course analyses at the single-nucleus level show that transcriptional reprogramming is induced in most transplanted nuclei in a highly hierarchical manner. We demonstrate that an extensive exchange of somatic- for oocyte-specific factors mediates reprogramming and leads to robust oocyte RNA polymerase II binding and phosphorylation on transplanted chromatin. Moreover, genome-wide binding of oocyte-specific linker histone B4 supports its role in transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, our study reveals the rapid, abundant, and stepwise loading of oocyte-specific factors onto somatic chromatin as important determinants for successful reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Hippo signaling limits organ growth by inhibiting the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie. Despite the key role of Yorkie in both normal and oncogenic growth, the mechanism by which it activates transcription has not been defined. We report that Yorkie binding to chromatin correlates with histone H3K4 methylation and is sufficient to locally increase it. We show that Yorkie can recruit a histone methyltransferase complex through binding between WW domains of Yorkie and PPxY sequence motifs of NcoA6, a subunit of the Trithorax-related (Trr) methyltransferase complex. Cell culture and in vivo assays establish that this recruitment of NcoA6 contributes to Yorkie’s ability to activate transcription. Mammalian NcoA6, a subunit of Trr-homologous methyltransferase complexes, can similarly interact with Yorkie’s mammalian homolog YAP. Our results implicate direct recruitment of a histone methyltransferase complex as central to transcriptional activation by Yorkie, linking the control of cell proliferation by Hippo signaling to chromatin modification.

Abstract: Summary
The MYC oncogene regulates gene expression through multiple mechanisms, and its overexpression culminates in tumorigenesis. MYC inactivation reverses turmorigenesis through the loss of distinguishing features of cancer, including autonomous proliferation and survival. Here we report that MYC via miR-17-92 maintains a neoplastic state through the suppression of chromatin regulatory genes Sin3b, Hbp1, Suv420h1, and Btg1, as well as the apoptosis regulator Bim. The enforced expression of miR-17-92 prevents MYC suppression from inducing proliferative arrest, senescence, and apoptosis and abrogates sustained tumor regression. Knockdown of the five miR-17-92 target genes blocks senescence and apoptosis while it modestly delays proliferative arrest, thus partially recapitulating miR-17-92 function. We conclude that MYC, via miR-17-92, maintains a neoplastic state by suppressing specific target genes.

Abstract: We aimed to determine the oxidative stress and antioxidant status in preeclamptic placenta. Also, we investigated the apoptotic index of villous trophoblast and proliferation index of cytotrophoblasts. The study included 32 pregnant with preeclampsia and 31 normotensive healthy pregnant women. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant status (TAS) levels were measured in the placenta. For detection of apoptosis and proliferation in trophoblast, apoptosis protease activating factor 1 (APAF-1) and Ki-67 were used. Placental MDA levels in preeclamptic women were significantly higher than normal pregnancies (p=0.002). There was no significant difference between the groups in the TAS levels of placenta (p=0.773). Also, the apoptotic index in villous trophoblasts increased (p<0.001), but proliferation index did not change in preeclampsia (p=0.850).

Abstract: Astrocytes modulate synaptic transmission via release of gliotransmitters such as ATP, glutamate, d-serine and l-lactate. One of the main problems when studying the role of astrocytes in vitro and in vivo is the lack of suitable tools for their selective activation. Optogenetic actuators can be used to manipulate astrocytic activity by expression of variants of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or other optogenetic actuators with the aim to initiate intracellular events such as intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and/or cAMP increases. We have developed an array of adenoviral vectors (AVV) with ChR2-like actuators, including an enhanced ChR2 mutant (H134R), and a mutant with improved Ca2+ permeability (Ca2+ translocating channelrhodopsin, CatCh). We show here that [Ca2+]i elevations evoked by ChR2(H134R) and CatCh in astrocytes are largely due to release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores. The autocrine action of ATP which is released under these conditions and acts on the P2Y receptors also contributes to the [Ca2+]i elevations. We also studied effects evoked using light-sensitive G-protein coupled receptors (opto-adrenoceptors). Activation of optoα1AR (Gq-coupled) and optoβ2AR (Gs-coupled) resulted in astrocytic [Ca2+]i increases which were suppressed by blocking the corresponding intracellular signalling cascade (phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase, respectively). Interestingly, the bulk of [Ca2+]i responses evoked using either optoAR was blocked by an ATP degrading enzyme, apyrase, or a P2Y1 receptor blocker, MRS 2179, indicating that they are to a large extent triggered by the autocrine action of ATP. We conclude that, whilst optimal tools for control of astrocytes are yet to be generated, the currently available optogenetic actuators successfully initiate biologically relevant signalling events in astrocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors detect non-self RNAs during virus infections and initiate antiviral signaling. One receptor, MDA5, possesses essential signaling domains, but weak RNA binding. A second receptor, LGP2, rapidly detects diverse dsRNA species, but lacks signaling domains. Accumulating evidence suggests LGP2 and MDA5 work together to detect viral RNA and generate a complete antiviral response, but the basis for their cooperation has been elusive. Experiments presented here address this gap in antiviral signaling, revealing that LGP2 assists MDA5-RNA interactions leading to enhanced MDA5-mediated antiviral signaling. LGP2 increases the initial rate of MDA5-RNA interaction and regulates MDA5 filament assembly, resulting in the formation of more numerous, shorter MDA5 filaments that are shown to generate equivalent or greater signaling activity in vivo than the longer filaments containing only MDA5. These findings provide a mechanism for LGP2 coactivation of MDA5 and a biological context for MDA5-RNA filaments in antiviral responses.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic inflammation constitutes an important link between obesity and its pathophysiological sequelae. In contrast to the belief that inflammatory signals exert a fundamentally negative impact on metabolism, we show that proinflammatory signaling in the adipocyte is in fact required for proper adipose tissue remodeling and expansion. Three mouse models with an adipose tissue-specific reduction in proinflammatory potential were generated that display a reduced capacity for adipogenesis in vivo, while the differentiation potential is unaltered in vitro. Upon high-fat-diet exposure, the expansion of visceral adipose tissue is prominently affected. This is associated with decreased intestinal barrier function, increased hepatic steatosis, and metabolic dysfunction. An impaired local proinflammatory response in the adipocyte leads to increased ectopic lipid accumulation, glucose intolerance, and systemic inflammation. Adipose tissue inflammation is therefore an adaptive response that enables safe storage of excess nutrients and contributes to a visceral depot barrier that effectively filters gut-derived endotoxin.

Abstract: We isolated a rice (Oryza sativa L.) WRKY gene which is highly upregulated in senescent leaves, denoted OsWRKY42. Analysis of OsWRKY42-GFP expression and its effects on transcriptional activation in maize protoplasts suggested that the OsWRKY42 protein functions as a nuclear transcriptional repressor. OsWRKY42-overexpressing (OsWR KY42OX) transgenic rice plants exhibited an early leaf senescence phenotype with accumulation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide and a reduced chlorophyll content. Expression analysis of ROS producing and scavenging genes revealed that the metallothionein genes clustered on chromosome 12, especially OsMT1d, were strongly repressed in OsWRKY42OX plants. An OsMT1d promoter:LUC construct was found to be repressed by OsWRKY42 overexpression in rice protoplasts. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that OsWRKY42 binds to the W-box of the OsMT1d promoter. Our results thus suggest that OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d-mediated ROS scavenging and thereby promotes leaf senescence in rice.

Abstract: We have previously shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-760, miR-186, miR-337-3p, and miR-216b stimulate premature senescence through protein kinase CK2 (CK2) down-regulation in human colon cancer cells. Here, we examined whether these four miRNAs are involved in the replicative senescence of human lung fibroblast IMR-90 cells. miR-760 and miR-186 were significantly upregulated in replicatively senescent IMR-90 cells, and their joint action with both miR-337-3p and miR-216b was necessary for efficient downregulation of the α subunit of CK2 (CK2α) in IMR-90 cells. A mutation in any of the four miRNA-binding sequences within the CK2α 3′-untranslated region (UTR) indicated that all four miRNAs should simultaneously bind to the target sites for CK2α downregulation. The four miRNAs increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, p53 and p21Cip1/WAF1 expression, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in proliferating IMR-90 cells. CK2α over-expression almost abolished this event. Taken together, the present results suggest that the upregulation of miR-760 and miR-186 is associated with replicative senescence in human lung fibroblast cells, and their cooperative action with miR-337-3p and miR-216b may induce replicative senescence through CK2α downregulation-dependent ROS generation.

Abstract: The cell membrane provides critical cellular functions that rely on its elaborate structure and organization. The structure of turtle membranes is an important part of an ongoing study of erythrocyte membranes. Using a combination of atomic force microscopy and single-molecule force spectroscopy, we characterized the turtle erythrocyte membrane structure with molecular resolution in a quasi-native state. High-resolution images both leaflets of turtle erythrocyte membranes revealed a smooth outer membrane leaflet and a protein covered inner membrane leaflet. This asymmetry was verified by single-molecule force spectroscopy, which detects numerous exposed amino groups of membrane proteins in the inner membrane leaflet but much fewer in the outer leaflet. The asymmetric membrane structure of turtle erythrocytes is consistent with the semi-mosaic model of human, chicken and fish erythrocyte membrane structure, making the semi-mosaic model more widely applicable. From the perspective of biological evolution, this result may support the universality of the semi-mosaic model.

Abstract: Summary
We generated mice deficient in Lon protease (LONP1), a major enzyme of the mitochondrial quality control machinery. Homozygous deletion of Lonp1 causes early embryonic lethality, whereas its haploinsufficiency protects against colorectal and skin tumors. Furthermore, LONP1 knockdown inhibits cellular proliferation and tumor and metastasis formation, whereas its overexpression increases tumorigenesis. Clinical studies indicate that high levels of LONP1 are a poor prognosis marker in human colorectal cancer and melanoma. Additionally, functional analyses show that LONP1 plays a key role in metabolic reprogramming by remodeling OXPHOS complexes and protecting against senescence. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of LONP1 for cellular and organismal viability and identify this protease as a central regulator of mitochondrial activity in oncogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic intake of Western diet has driven an epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome, but how it induces mortality remains unclear. Here, we show that chronic intake of a high-fat diet (HFD), not a low-fat diet, leads to severe pulmonary damage and mortality in mice deficient in Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (DKO). Diet-induced pulmonary lesions are blocked by antibiotic treatment and are transmissible to wild-type mice upon either cohousing or fecal transplantation, pointing to the existence of bacterial pathogens. Indeed, diet and innate deficiency exert significant impact on gut microbiota composition. Thus, chronic intake of HFD promotes severe pulmonary damage and mortality in DKO mice in part via gut dysbiosis, a finding that may be important for immunodeficient patients, particularly those on chemotherapy or radiotherapy, where gut-microbiota-caused conditions are often life threatening.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomes form 3D structures that are critical to the regulation of cellular and genetic processes. Here, we present a study of global chromatin interaction patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our genome-wide approach confirmed interactions that were previously observed by other methods as well as uncovered long-range interactions such as those among small heterochromatic regions embedded in euchromatic arms. We also found that interactions are correlated with various epigenetic marks that are localized in active or silenced chromatin. Arabidopsis chromosomes do not contain large local interactive domains that resemble the topological domains described in animals but, instead, contain relatively small interactive regions scattered around the genome that contain H3K27me3 or H3K9me2. We generated interaction maps in mutants that are defective in specific epigenetic pathways and found altered interaction patterns that correlate with changes in the epigenome. These analyses provide further insights into molecular mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of the genome.

Abstract: Summary
Pruning of unnecessary axons and/or dendrites is crucial for maturation of the nervous system. However, little is known about cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that control neuronal pruning. In Drosophila, dendritic arborization neurons, ddaCs, selectively prune their larval dendrites. Here, we report that Rab5/ESCRT-mediated endocytic pathways are critical for dendrite pruning. Loss of Rab5 or ESCRT function leads to robust accumulation of the L1-type CAM Neuroglian (Nrg) on enlarged endosomes in ddaC neurons. Nrg is localized on endosomes in wild-type ddaC neurons and downregulated prior to dendrite pruning. Overexpression of Nrg alone is sufficient to inhibit dendrite pruning, whereas removal of Nrg causes precocious dendrite pruning. Epistasis experiments indicate that Rab5 and ESCRT restrain the inhibitory role of Nrg during dendrite pruning. Thus, this study demonstrates the cell-surface molecule that controls dendrite pruning and defines an important mechanism whereby sensory neurons, via endolysosomal pathway, downregulate the cell-surface molecule to trigger dendrite pruning.
