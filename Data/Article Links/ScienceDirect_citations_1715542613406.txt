Abstract: abstract
TMB2 (TM = Ti, Zr, and Hf) ultra-high temperature ceramics have experimentally been proved as efficient sunlight absorbers operating at elevated temperatures. However, few have been known on the origination and factors that control the absorption performance. In this manuscript, the electronic structure and optical properties of TMB2 (TM = Ti, Zr, and Hf) were investigated by first principles calculations. Quasiparticle correction is introduced in the calculation of electronic structure. The theoretical dielectric function and optical constants are in good agreement with experiments. The reflectance spectra of TMB2 demonstrate they are typical spectrally selective materials. The spectral selectivity of these borides at high temperature is weakened when effect of temperature is considered. The anisotropy in solar absorption of TMB2 is rather weak. Discussion on the solar absorbance and thermal emittance reveals that plasma frequency acts on the solar absorbance and high temperature thermal emittance contradictorily. Our theoretical results demonstrate that it is feasible to tune the spectral selectivity of diborides by regulating the plasma frequency through cation doping.

Abstract: Molten chloride salts such as MgCl2/KCl/NaCl are promising thermal energy storage (TES) materials and heat transfer fluids (HTF) in next generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants with elevated operation temperatures (>700 °C) due to their high thermal stability and low material costs. However, they have strong corrosivity against metallic structural materials at high temperatures which can be related to the presence of hydrolysis products such as MgOHCl. In an electrolytic purification method reported in previous work, a W-cathode and Mg-anode were used to reduce the concentration of these impurities, thereby effectively purifying the molten MgCl2/KCl/NaCl salt. However, the W-cathode passivation due to production of MgO on the surface limited its cathode effectiveness. In this work, an improved electrolytic purification method is presented to avoid the electrode passivation by using two identical Mg-electrodes and alternating voltage (AV, i.e., switching the voltage direction applied periodically). A continuous electrolytic salt purification in the AV-mode is successfully performed on the molten MgCl2/KCl/NaCl salt in the 100 g-scale. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) on the molten salt shows that the purification can effectively reduce the concentration of the main corrosive impurity MgOH+Cl−. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) measurements on a commercial alloy (Incoloy 800 H) immersed in the molten salt indicate significantly reduced corrosion rates (i.e., reduced salt corrosivity) compared to a non-purified salt. The continuity of the improved method allows for a long-term effective purification without the risk of passivation and deactivation of electrodes, thereby showing great potential in corrosion control of molten chloride salt TES system.

Abstract: The backsheet of a photovoltaic (PV) module functions primarily to provide safe operation through electrical insulation and protect the interior from environmental exposure. For most applications, backsheets consist of opaque, but highly reflective, films that protect inner layers from degradation from ultraviolet (UV) light. Backsheets can fail if they delaminate or form cracks under strain. In a PV module, the maximum strains that can be applied are only on the order of a few percent. The greatest strains are likely to be highly localized around topographical features. Therefore, to assess the likelihood of a crack being initiated in a backsheet, we apply small amplitude strains to backsheet films under microscopic examination using a laser scanning confocal microscope. This allows us to monitor both the depth and density of cracks as well as the onset strain. Here we perform these measurements after exposure to UV light.

Abstract: In order to explore the potentialities of Cr1-x(Al)xNy materials in multilayer-based solar selective coatings (SSC) for high temperature applications (T > 500 °C), the optical behavior of Cr1-x(Al)xNy films is studied in this work. Two sets of layers (CrNy and Cr1-xAlxNy) were prepared by direct current (DC) and high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) technology. The deposition parameters: N2 flux, HiPIMS frequency and aluminum sputtering power, were modified to get a wide variety of stoichiometries. The composition, morphology, phases and electronic structure of the films were characterized in depth. The optical behavior was determined by UV–Vis–NIR and FTIR spectroscopies, and the optical constants were obtained from the measured transmittance and reflectance spectra based on appropriate dielectric function models. Our results indicate that small changes in the layer composition influence the optical constants. In particular, a metallic-like behavior was obtained for CrNy layers with N vacancies (CrN0.95 and CrN0.67 films) while a semiconductor-like behavior was observed for CrN1.08. Thus, the CrNy films can be used as effective absorber layer in multilayer-based SSC, and namely, the CrN0.67 film as an IR reflector/absorber layer too. Likewise, the optical properties of Cr1-xAlxNy layers can also be tuned from metallic to semiconductor-like behavior depending on the chemical composition. Indeed, the absorption coefficients of Cr1-xAlxNy films with optimized Al content and N-vacancies are comparable to those reported for state-of-the-art materials such as TiAlN or TiAlCrN. In addition, a Cr0.96Al0.04N0.89 film was found to be a suitable IR reflector/absorber layer.

Abstract: The degradation characteristic of GaInP/GaAs/In0.3Ga0.7As inverted metamorphic (IMM) triple junction solar cells irradiated by 1 MeV electron and 10 MeV proton have been studied and compared to that of traditional GaInP/InGaAs/Ge lattice matched (LM) triple junction solar cells. Both IMM and LM solar cells exhibited very good radiation resistance upon 3.16 × 1010 MeV/g displacement damage dose electron and proton irradiation level. The remaining factor of maximum output power is 0.86 and 0.85 for electron irradiation and 0.73 and 0.75 for proton irradiation in IMM and LM solar cells, respectively. IMM solar cell showed better properties in current matching in end-of-life condition comparing to that of LM solar cells. 1 MeV electron to 10 MeV proton irradiation relative damage coefficients, Rep, for IMM and LM solar cells are determined as 3.11 and 2.78, respectively, by using equivalent displacement damage dose model. The radiation damage coefficient of diffusion length upon 1 MeV electron and 10 MeV proton irradiation for both types of solar cell structures have been calculated.

Abstract: Proper materialographic sample preparation is vital in electron microscopy to produce the best quality material results, nearest to its true structure. Environments and media such as molten salts render traditional methods inadequate for analysis. An evaluation of conventional preparation techniques with different lubricants on 316 L stainless steel from its interaction with 59.4/40.6 wt% Na2CO3/NaCl eutectic salt show how corrosion layer information is lost or retained. Additional large-scale composite electron imaging and compound analysis work on the corrosion effects of 68.05/31.95 wt% Na2SO4/NaCl was also investigated on C-276 nickel superalloy. The new adaptation of sample preparation using kerosene as a lubricant is the best available option for compound analysis of molten salt corrosion, allowing corrosion mechanisms to be more well understood. The method also provided a sample surface that allows phase mapping and compound identification to a higher degree of accuracy than previously seen in the literature.

Abstract: Background
Thrombocytopenia is a frequently encountered laboratory abnormality and a common reason for hematology referrals. Workup for thrombocytopenia is not standardized and frequently does not follow an evidence-based algorithm. We conducted a systematic analysis to evaluate the laboratory testing and outcomes of patients evaluated for thrombocytopenia at hematology clinics in a tertiary referral center between 2013 and 2016.
Patient and methods
We performed a comprehensive chart review for patients evaluated for thrombocytopenia during the study period. Patients were followed for 1 year from the initial hematology evaluation and assessed for the development of a hematologic malignancy, rheumatologic, or infectious diseases among other clinical outcomes.
Results
We evaluated 472 patients with a median (range) age of 61 (17–94) years. The majority (63.8%) had mild thrombocytopenia. Within 1 year of follow-up, 14 patients (3.0%) were diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy. A higher likelihood of developing a hematologic malignancy was noted in patients with concurrent leukopenia (hazard ratio [HR] 9.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.28–30.32, p < .01) and increasing age (HR per 10-year deciles 1.52, 95% CI 1.03–2.25, p = .03). In patients with asymptomatic isolated mild thrombocytopenia, laboratory testing did not reveal any significant positive findings and patients did not receive any new major diagnosis during the follow-up period.
Conclusion
Our findings provide basis and call for development of an evidence-based algorithmic approach for evaluation of patients with thrombocytopenia, testing, and referrals. It also supports a conservative approach mainly driven by physical exam signs, symptoms, and other laboratory findings for patients with isolated mild thrombocytopenia.

Abstract: Sensory nerve endings within the wall of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may respond to bacterial signalling, providing the basis for key biological processes that underlie intestinal motility and microbial homeostasis. Enteric neurons and smooth muscle cells are well known to express an array of receptors, including G-protein coupled receptors and ligand-gated ion channels, that can sense chemical ligands and other bacterially-derived substances. These include short chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids and lipopolysaccharide. For neural detection of microbial activators to occur, luminal substances must first interact with enterocytes for direct signalling or cross paracellularly. Recent studies indicate that bacterial-derived microvesicles can cross the gut epithelial barrier and affect motility. This suggests a possible intercellular communication pathway between the GI tract and the ENS. We explore the idea that bacterial microvesicles can behave as a delivery package for communication between microbe and host.

Abstract: System voltages can cause significant degradation in photovoltaic modules. Polarization-type potential-induced degradation (PID) is accompanied by decreases in the short-circuit current density and the open-circuit voltage. The system voltage causes a polarization and surface charge accumulation, increasing the interface recombination. The surface passivation and the emitter doping concentration and gradient are considered to have large impacts. However, a systematic study on these effects has not yet been performed. In this paper, the effects of the front surface structure of n-type passivated emitter and rear totally diffused cell modules were investigated by accelerated PID tests. Standard cells with thin silicon dioxide/80-nm silicon nitride (SiNx) antireflection/passivation layers, refractive index (RI) of 2.0, exhibited typical polarization-type PID. Cells with increased RI = 2.4 for the bottom 20-nm SiNx showed no degradation at all. This may be caused by reduced charge accumulation in the SiNx layer near the interface due to the higher electrical conductivity of the Si-rich bottom layer. Secondly, cells with both a highly distorted interface, due to nitrogen insertion in the silicon surface, and an emitter with a high surface doping concentration have excellent resistance to PID. Cells with either the highly distorted interface or the higher emitter-surface doping concentration show no to minor improved resistance to PID. These findings improve the understanding of the effects of the front surface structure of cells on the polarization-type PID and may contribute to the implementation of these measures to reduce PID.

Abstract: Wide bandgap metal halide perovskites materials are of interest for application as top subcells in multijunction devices. In contrast to smaller gap perovskite devices that perform fairly close to their internal Shockley-Queisser limit, wide gap versions show substantial deficits. To understand the origin of the limitations in more detail we simulated the performance of wide bandgap devices as a function of the energy band offsets at the contacts. Our results show that traditionally-used charge transport layers such as spiro-OMeTAD and TiO2 limit the performance of wide bandgap absorbers through a subtle interplay between effects on VOC and FF. We investigate the optimal characteristics for the charge transport layers as function of absorber bandgap and identify the needed band offsets at the p- and n-interfaces. Our results call for more research on charge transport layers to minimize the VOC and performance deficit in wide bandgap devices.

Abstract: The three dimensions (3D) Solid/Liquid (S/L) interface is hard to be directly detected during the directional solidification silicon ingot growth, making it an obstacle to study their influence on the defect density and electrical properties of the solar cells. In this work, we firstly release a method to identify and measure the 3D S/L interface shape of G6 size silicon ingots for the photovoltaic (PV) industry. Secondly, we study the relations between the 3D S/L interface shape and the hot zone structure, the growth of the defect density in the ingots, and the conversion efficiency of the solar cells. A highly symmetrical and mild convex 3D S/L interface shape is obtained by optimization of the heat dissipation structure and the type of the heater power (AC/DC) of the hot zone, while it presents distorted at the periphery of the ingots grown by the conventional hot zone. The formation mechanism of the distorted 3D S/L interface shapes is discussed with the spatial distribution of the growth speed derived from a modified Stefans’ equation at the interface. The distribution of defect densities within the optimized ingot is uniform and lower than that of the conventional ingot. And as a consequence, the weighted average solar cell efficiency of the optimized ingot is increased by 0.08%, and the deviation of the cell conversion efficiency decreases from 0.13% to 0.07%.

Abstract: Objective
Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has been reported to repress the expression of various genes by eliminating acetyl group from histone. The objective of this study was to discuss the effect of HDAC3/microRNA-130a-3p (miR-130a-3p)/high-mobility group box 3 (HMGB3) on immune escape of breast cancer.
Methods
HDAC3, miR-130a-3p and HMGB3 expression in breast cancer tissues and cells were tested, and the correlation between HDAC3, miR-130a-3p and HMGB3 was analyzed. CD8, CD69 and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression was detected. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with relative plasmid of HDAC3 or miR-130a-3p to test cell viability, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. The cytotoxicity of CD8+/CD69+/PD-1+T cells in MDA-MB-231 cells was tested, and CD8+/CD69+/PD-1+T cell proliferation and apoptosis before and after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells were detected.
Results
HDAC3 and HMGB3 expression were raised and miR-130a-3p expression was diminished in breast cancer tissues and cells. HDAC3 was negatively correlated with miR-130a-3p while miR-130a-3p was negatively correlated with HMGB3. Down-regulating HDAC3 or up-regulating miR-130a-3p restrained cell viability, migration, EMT and anti-CD8+/CD69+/PD-1+T cytotoxicity and facilitated apoptosis of breast cancer cells. HDAC3 regulated HMGB3 by mediating miR-130a-3p expression. Down-regulating miR-130a-3p reversed the role of HDAC3 reduction on breast cancer cells. HDAC3 regulated CD8+/CD69+/PD-1+T cell proliferation and apoptosis by mediating miR-130a-3p.
Conclusion
This study provides evidence that HDAC3 increases HMGB3 expression to promote the immune escape of breast cancer cells via down-regulating miR-130a-3p.

Abstract: Cardiac fibrosis and myocyte hypertrophy play contributory roles in the progression of diseases such as heart Failure (HF) through what is collectively termed cardiac remodelling. The phosphoinositide 3- kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target for rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway (PI3K/Akt- mTOR) is an important pathway in protein synthesis, cell growth, cell proliferation, and lipid metabolism. The sphingolipid, dihydrosphingosine 1 phosphate (dhS1P) has been shown to bind to high density lipids in plasma. Unlike its analog, spingosine 1 phosphate (S1P), the role of dhS1P in cardiac fibrosis is still being deciphered. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of dhS1P on PI3K/Akt signalling in primary cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes. Our findings demonstrate that inhibiting PI3K reduced collagen synthesis in neonatal cardiac fibroblasts (NCFs), and hypertrophy in neonatal cardiac myocytes (NCMs) induced by dhS1P, in vitro. Reduced activation of the PI3K/Akt- mTOR signalling pathway led to impaired translation of fibrotic proteins such as collagen 1 (Coll1) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and inhibited the transcription and translation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1). PI3K inhibition also affected the gene expression of S1P receptors and enzymes such as the dihydroceramide delta 4 desaturase (DEGS1) and sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) in the de novo sphingolipid pathway. While in myocytes, PI3K inhibition reduced myocyte hypertrophy induced by dhS1P by reducing skeletal muscle α- actin (αSKA) mRNA expression, and protein translation due to increased glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) mRNA expression. Our findings show a relationship between the PI3K/Akt- mTOR signalling cascade and exogenous dhS1P induced collagen synthesis and myocyte hypertrophy in primary neonatal cardiac cells.

Abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a prevalent cancer worldwide, has a high incidence of loco-regional dissemination, frequent recurrence, and lower 5-year survival rates. Current gold standard treatments for advanced HNSCC rely primarily on radiotherapy and chemotherapy but with limited efficacy and significant side effects. In this study, we characterized a novel 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) carrier composed of chitosan solution (CS) and polycaprolactone (PCL) microparticles (MPs) in HNSCC preclinical models. The designed MPs were evaluated for their size, morphology, drug entrapment efficiency (EE%) and in vitro drug release profile. The anti-cancer activity of 5-FU-loaded particles was assessed in HNSCC human cell lines (CAL27 and HSC3) and in a preclinical mouse model (AT84) utilizing cell proliferation and survival, cell motility, and autophagy endpoints. The results demonstrated a 38.57 % in 5-FU entrapment efficiency associated with reduced 5-FU in vitro release up to 96 h post-exposure. Furthermore, CS-decorated PCL MPs were able to promote a significant inhibition of cancer cell proliferation based on the metabolic and colony formation assays, in comparison to controls. In contrast, CS-decorated PCL MPs did not influence the pharmacological efficacy of 5-FU to inhibit in vitro cancer cell migration. Last, cell protein analysis revealed a significant increase of autophagy and cell death evaluated by LC3-II expression and PARP1 cleavage, respectively. In summary, these results support the potential utility of CS-decorated PCL MPs as an effective 5-FU-delivery carrier to improve HNSCC therapeutic management.

Abstract: Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia (GT) is an autosomal recessive congenital bleeding disorder of platelet aggregation. Mutations in ITGA2B and ITGB3 genes result in quantitative and/or qualitative abnormalities of the glycoprotein receptor complex IIb/IIIa (integrin αIIbβ3), which in turn impairs platelet aggregation and lead to GT. In this study, whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping as well as whole exome sequencing was performed in a large family segregating GT. Analysis of the genotypes localized the disease region to chromosome 17q21.2–q21.3. Filtration of whole exome data and candidate variants prioritization identified a pathogenic variant in the ITGB3 gene. The single nucleotide deletion variant (c.2113delC) in exon 13 of the ITGB3 gene is predicted to cause a frameshift and absence of vital C-terminal domains including the transmembrane helix and the cytoplasmic domain. Clinical variability of the bleeding phenotype in affected individuals with the same mutation suggests that other genetic and nongenetic factors are responsible for determining GT features.

Abstract: Thermosetting semi-interpenetrating phase change materials (SIPCMs) containing anchored and free polyethylene glycol (PEG) were synthesized via high efficiency esterification reaction without by-products of low molecular weight, enabling heat-triggered bulk network self-dissociation (NSD) towards linear/branched polymers from polymer networks. The NSD resulted from the catalyst-involved transesterification reaction between free PEG and network chains with readily tunable heat-triggered conditions. The SIPCMs with latent heat up to 130 J/g had high thermal reliability and stability during phase change (~50 °C) and could encounter with NSD above triggered temperature (150–180 °C). The NSD technique will enable the sustainability, recycling and degradability of thermosets, providing an alternative to molecular design of smart polymer networks.

Abstract: The choice of polymer material as photovoltaic (PV) module front cover is important to realize high optical transparency and high UV-resistance. We have successfully designed and prepared a polymer multilayer film (PMF) with UV-resistance & High transmittance which could provide a low-cost, simple but effective way to address the weight issue of PV modules. Compared with conventional PV glass which has transmissivity greater than 90% at 400–1200 nm, the PMF we designed has equivalent transmissivity between 410 and 1200 nm and high reflectance (R>90%) at 320–400 nm.The glass-free and semi-flexible crystalline silicon PV module has a power generation efficiency of 20.37% and the efficiency of the control group with glass as a cover layer is 20.67%. The weight of our designed module can be greatly reduced by 85%. The photo aging experiment shows that the PMF has an excellent UV-resistance which makes it suitable for long-term outdoor deployment. The materials and multiple co-extrusion processes necessary to fabricate such films are suitable for large-scale manufacturing. This research provides valuable contributions in the future preparations and applications for PMF.

Abstract: BiVO4 nanoparticles deposited onto TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNT) are used as heterostructured photoanodes in a compact-design photo-electrocatalytic (PEC) cell for solar-driven water splitting. No dopants, photosensitizers or other cocatalysts are added to enhance the catalytic activity but attention is focused on the relationship between TNT nanostructure (necessary for the novel compact-design PEC cell) and method of BiVO4 deposition. Three indicators are used to evaluate the catalytic performances: i) photocurrent density, ii) H2 production rate, and iii) solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH). Their dependence on photoanode characteristics (i.e. grade of TNT crystallinity) and operational parameters, such as anolyte concentration (NaOH in the range 0.1–1.0 M) and type of solar illumination (open spectrum or AM 1.5G filtered light), is analysed. While a linear relationship is observed between H2 production rate and photocurrent density, the behaviour of STH efficiency is more complex. An ordered and crystalline TNT film is necessary to maximize photocurrent density and H2 production rate, which can be further enhanced by depositing BiVO4. However, the methodology of BiVO4 deposition and the specific TNT nanoarchitecture have a marked influence in terms of light absorption, electronic conductivity and rate of reaction between photogenerated holes and OH−. This leads to an improvement or a depression of the photocatalytic behaviour as BiVO4 may in some cases favour charge recombination. Thus, understanding the role of the photoelectrodes in relation to the operational conditions may favour the preparation of scalable electrodes for improving performances of PEC cells in the generation of solar fuels.

Abstract: We have developed and first reported Au/Ni/Pr2O3/GaN broadband photodetector device with photoresponsivity from 205 nm to 750 nm under self-powered mode. Using the Tauc's plot, the direct optical bandgap was found to be 4.8, 2.45 and 2.35 eV for the as-deposited, 550 °C and 650 °C post annealed samples, respectively. XRD study revealed that the phase of the as-deposited and post-annealed Pr2O3 films on GaN was monoclinic in nature. Atomic force microscopy method was engaged in non-contact mode to investigate the surface morphology of Pr2O3 films on GaN and the rms surface roughness was improved for the 650 °C post-annealed sample as 1.1 nm compared to other samples. In XPS study, two main Pr3d well separated XPS peaks were noticed at 933.5 eV (m) and 953.9 eV (m′) which corresponds to spin-orbit doublets of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively. In addition, the transient response measurements of the fabricated 650 °C post annealed device confirmed good stability even for the applied bias voltage of 20 V in the entire UV region. Further, the 650 °C post annealed device at 20 V provided best rise and fall times of 0.57 s and 0.41 s at 360 nm, respectively. The responsivity of the fabricated BB PD device at 650 °C revealed the evidence of bias dependency because of photoconductive gain. The attained progress in the fabricated PD device performance was due to the improved light absorption as evidenced from the optical absorption study. This results the transport of photogenerated electron-hole pairs across the bandgap by limiting recombination/trap states and intentionally deposited LT GaN buffer layer at the interface of sapphire/GaN. These results suggest that the developed BB PD device could also have the potential usage in optoelectronic device applications.

Abstract: We determine the limiting efficiency for monolithic tandem solar cells that employ crystalline silicon for the top-cell as well as for the bottom cell. In such a design, the top-cell extends over the region of very high generation rate that forms at the front of the device. Consequently, the design benefits from a high excess carrier density in the top-cell, resulting in a voltage in the tandem device that is more than twice the voltage of equally thick single junction solar cells. Considering Coulomb-enhanced Auger recombination coefficient, we find a maximum efficiency of 30.7% for a total device thickness of 500 μm wherein the top cell thickness amounts to 2.15 μm, representing gain of 1.1% (abs) with respect to the limiting efficiency of single junction devices.

Abstract: Due to the low direct thermal effect of solar irradiation, conventional phase-change microcapsules have poor solar energy utilization capability. To increase the solar-to-thermal energy storage efficiency, in this work, we reported a light-driven microencapsulated n-eicosane based on a crystalline TiO2 shell coated by graphene oxide (GO)-based copper monosulfide (CuS) (CuS-GO) nanoconverter. Due to the combination of local surface plasma resonance (LSPR), semiconductor and synergetic effects, the CuS-GO nanoconverter conferred full-spectrum solar light-to-thermal conversion capability on the microcapsule system. The resultant n-eicosane@TiO2@CuS-GO microcapsules achieved high full-spectrum solar-to-thermal storage efficiency (97.1%) under stimulated solar light with no compromise of the latent heat density (212.0 ± 1.2 J/g). Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of n-eicosane@TiO2@CuS-GO (0.985 ± 0.004 W/(m·K)) significantly increased by 39.9% compared with that of n-eicosane@TiO2. These results indicate that this light-driven microcapsule with superior properties is advantageous for direct solar-to-thermal energy utilization applications.

Abstract: The temperature coefficient (TC) is a critical figure of merit to accurately evaluate the performance of solar cells at various operating temperatures, and hence, enabling the comparison between different cell technologies. Recently, tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells have shown outstanding cell performance. They are likely to be adopted in production lines and deployed in the field in the near future. Therefore, knowledge of their TCs and insights into their performance at realistic operating temperatures are of significant interest. In this study, we investigate the temperature dependence of the performance of TOPCon solar cells and quantify their TCs. To gain better understanding regarding the temperature-dependent behavior of their performance, the passivation quality and the contact resistivity of polysilicon (poly-Si) passivating contacts as a function of temperature are investigated. Although an improvement of the passivation quality of these contacts with increasing temperature has been observed, it seems that this improvement weakly impacts on the open-circuit voltage TC. The cell performance at elevated temperatures is dominated by the drop in the open-circuit voltage, associated with the intrinsic carrier concentration related to band gap narrowing. The fill factor TC (TCFF) is superior to those of other cell structures reported in the literature. We attribute this favorable TCFF to the fact that some of the fill factor losses are compensated by the decrease of contact resistivity of the poly-Si passivating contacts at elevated temperatures. The relative TC of the cell efficiency of the investigated TOPCon cells is comparable to the TC of silicon heterojunction cells and it is superior to those of cell structures without passivating contacts. Moreover, we found that the investigated solar cell is more sensitive to temperature variation at lower illumination intensities.

Abstract: Concentrated solar thermal technologies play an essential role in the energetic transition which is currently facing our society. The energy generation in this technology vastly depends on the optical behaviour of the reflector materials of the solar field. Corrosion of solar reflectors might be an issue in locations with high corrosive environments because an excessive corrosion of the solar mirror could be catastrophic for the profitability of the concentrated solar thermal plant. This research is focusing on modelling the durability of four different solar reflector materials exposed outdoors by accelerated aging tests. For this purpose, ten locations suitable for concentrating solar thermal applications were classified depending on their corrosive aggressiveness. Commercial, free-lead and low-cost reflectors samples were exposed in all the sites to determine the influence of the corrosion in its durability. Corrosion defects appeared in the solar reflectors during outdoor exposure were properly reproduced by CASS test. Novel lifetime prediction models were developed for all the solar reflectors depending on the corrosive aggressiveness of the place. Number and thickness of the paint coatings employed in the solar mirrors were identified as one of the most important parameters to improve the energy generation of a CSP plant in corrosive environments. A reduction of the capital invested in the solar mirror purchase is expected for sites with low corrosivity.

Abstract: Background
We evaluated feasibility, safety, and total resource use of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) in a pilot study of patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) over a 6-month period.
Methods
A total of 20 eligible patients were treated with SCIG at 0.1 g/kg/week for up to 6 months. Patients were matched to 20 concurrent intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) controls. Clinical outcomes measured included adverse reactions, healthcare resource use, patient satisfaction, and quality of life (QOL). (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03401268.)
Results
Groups were comparable in terms of age, weight, sex, transplant indication, donor type, and conditioning intensity. All 20 IVIG patients completed 6 consecutive months of therapy compared with 13/20 (65%) SCIG patients. There were no adverse reactions in IVIG patients, compared with six (30%) SCIG patients. All adverse reactions in SCIG patients were grade I, transient, and required no medical intervention. Median overall cost per patient was lower with SCIG than with IVIG ($9,756 vs. $13,780, p = .046). Among patients who completed 6 months of SCIG, median preference and satisfaction scores were 100%. Over the 6-month period, QOL scores remained stable in SCIG patients.
Conclusions
In a subgroup of patients, SCIG was associated with high patient satisfaction and a reduction in total healthcare costs compared with IVIG in a cohort of HCT patients.

Abstract: Circular RNA (circRNA) is a member of the non-coding RNA family that is formed by trans-splicing. Because of its unique structure and characteristics, it has extraordinary value for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of diseases, particularly for tumors. Study of the role of circRNAs in the occurrence and development of prostate cancer has made considerable progress, but many areas remain that require further exploration and improvement. This article describes research into sequencing expression profiles, expression regulation, potential value as biomarkers, mechanism in the occurrence and development, therapy resistance, relationship with clinicopathological features, and prognostic value of circRNAs in prostate cancer from the past few years.

Abstract: Annealing temperature has a significant influence on the performances of the electrochromic films and devices, such as optical transmittance modulation, response time and cyclic stability. Although there are lots of reports on the effect of annealing temperature on the performance of monolayer, the relationship between annealing temperature and electrochromic devices (ECDs) is rarely studied. Here, all-solid-state ECDs glass/ITO/NiO/ZrO2/Li/WO3/ITO are prepared by evaporation method and annealed at different temperature from 200 °C to 400 °C. The results show that the cyclic stability of the ECDs has a strong association with the annealing temperature. The ECDs annealed at low temperature suffer from poor cyclic stability because of the irreversible insertion of Li ions in WO3 layer. The ECD annealed at 400 °C exhibits superior stability with high optical modulation of 50.2% even after 50000 cycles at wavelength of 400–1050 nm. The influence mechanism of annealing temperature on the ECDs is analyzed which has great value for practical application.

Abstract: PI3K/AKT signaling has a crucial role in breast cancer incidence and finding the miRNAs that regulate this pathway enhances our understanding of breast cancer regulation. Firstly, our bioinformatics analysis suggested miR-1226-3p as a bona fide regulator of HER2, PIK3R2, and AKT1 putative target genes. Secondly, RT-qPCR, ELISA test and western blotting showed that overexpression of miR-1226 was followed by reduced expression of HER2, PIK3R2, and AKT1 putative targets genes in SKBR3 cells. Third, dual luciferase assay verified direct interaction of miR-1226-3p with 3′UTR sequences of these target genes. Then, overexpression of miR-1226 in SKBR3 cells brought about increased population of sub-G1 and decreased populations of G1 cells, measured by flow cytometry. This was consistent to the reduction of p-AKT protein and increased BAX protein levels, detected by western analysis and consistent to decreased CCND1 genes expression, detected by RT-qPCR. The reduced survival and increased apoptosis rate of these cells was also verified through MTT, Annexin V-FITC and Live-Dead cell staining assays. Our results suggest that miR-1226-3p is a tumor suppressor in SKBR3 cells. However, following the overexpression of miR-1226 in MDA-MB-231 cells, Bax/Bcl2 ratio and CCND1 genes expression levels were not significantly changed, sub-G1 and G1 cell cycle population were reduced while, S and G2/M cell populations were increased, consistent to the results acquired from the apoptosis and staining assays. Finally, TCGA data analysis and RT-qPCR against 20 pairs of Normal/Tumor breast tissues indicated that miR-1226-3p has been downregulated in breast cancer. Overall, the present study gathered shreds of evidence that suggest miR-1226-3p as a tumor suppressor that exerts its inhibitory effect on SKBR3 cells through targeting of HER2, PIK3R2, and AKT1 genes and downregulates PI3K/AKT pathway.

Abstract: Gene therapy (GT) has been reported to improve bone marrow function in individuals with Fanconi anemia (FA); however, its clinical application is still in the initial stages. We conducted this systematic review, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to assess the long-term safety and clinical outcomes of GT in FA patients. Electronic searches from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were conducted and full texts of articles meeting our inclusion criteria were reviewed. Three clinical trials were included, with a total of nine patients and mean age of 10.7 ± 5.7 years. All patients had lentiviral-mediated GT. A 1-year follow-up showed stabilization in blood lineages, without any serious adverse effects from GT. A metaregression analysis could not be conducted, as very little long-term follow-up data of patients was observed, and the median survival rate could not be calculated. Thus, we can conclude that GT seems to be a safe procedure in FA; however, further research needs to be conducted on the longitudinal clinical effects of GT in FA, for a better insight into its potential to become a standard form of treatment.

Abstract: A chloride-based molten-salt system that uses a ternary blend of MgCl2/KCl/NaCl is investigated to provide higher-temperature thermal energy storage capability than conventional nitrate salt-based systems. Despite their high thermal stability and operating temperature, molten chlorides present several challenges, including the design of internal liners to prevent the corrosion and thermal stress of alloy tank shells. This work discusses issues and potential solutions related to containment of molten chloride salt, specifically the optimization of the hot face refractory materials for use as internal liners. Three down-selected refractory materials were analyzed with respect to permeation of salt through the material as well as chemical stability during high temperature operation. Through the application of X-ray imaging and electron spectroscopy techniques, highly stable secondary surface phases in equilibrium with the molten salt were identified, as well as time-dependent changes in the salt composition itself.

Abstract: High conductivity silver pastes are usually incompatible for use with thermally sensitive devices due to their higher sintering temperatures while nanoparticle inks are costly and undergo high particle agglomeration. Effectively transparent contacts (ETCs) have been designed to increase the transmittance, reduce reflectance and overcome shadowing losses in solar cells while enhancing the overall conductivity and charge collection through the grid. In this study, reactive silver ink (RSI) is mixed with a low temperature sintering conductive silver paste (150 °C) for deposition via a microchannel approach. ETCs deposited using the resulting composite were cured at a lower temperature (100 °C) with a conductivity of the order of 103 1/Ω-cm and a transparency >90% in the visible region, promising a reduction in optical and electrical losses when compared to bare transparent conductive oxides. The use of low temperature curing conductive material makes ETCs suitable for use in thermally sensitive optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, hence they were ultimately deposited on perovskite solar cells and the solar cell parameters were measured.

Abstract: The hydrothermal synthesis of monoclinic-phase vanadium dioxide (VO2(M)) has been extensively studied for applications in energy-saving smart windows. In the majority of reported hydrothermal reactions, the reaction intermediates are first synthesized using vanadium-containing agents and additives. These vanadium precursors are then added to pressurized reactors for the hydrothermal synthesis of VO2(M). However, no studies have systematically investigated the structures and compositions of vanadium precursors used for hydrothermal syntheses. In this study, we demonstrated the single-step hydrothermal synthesis of VO2(M) nanocrystals (NCs) using phase-pure vanadium precursors obtained by size-selective purification. We observed that the structures and compositions of the vanadium precursors significantly influenced the hydrothermal synthesis products. Specifically, ammonium metavanadate and hydrazine monohydrate were reacted to yield metastable vanadium precursors that were purified via size-selective precipitation and then selectively transformed into phase-pure VO2(M), VO2(B), and (NH4)2V4O9 by hydrothermal synthesis. The obtained phase-pure VO2(M) NCs exhibited enhanced luminous transmittance (55%) and solar modulation ability (18%), the value of the latter being one of the highest reported for hydrothermally synthesized VO2(M). W-doped VO2(M) NCs showed superior phase transition behaviors to those of undoped VO2(M) NCs, while the phase transition temperature was systematically reduced depending on the W-doping concentration. In addition, we experimentally demonstrated that integrating the W-doped VO2(M) into the window of a model house reduced the in-house temperature under daytime solar radiation, which exhibits the potential of our VO2(M) films for use in energy-saving window applications.

Abstract: Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe)-based solar cells are promising candidates for efficient sunlight harvesting. However, their complex composition and microstructure can change under operation conditions, for instance heating from sun light illumination can lead to a degradation in performance. Here, we investigate the thermally-induced degradation processes in a set of CIGSe-based solar cells that were annealed at temperatures between 150 °C and 300 °C. Using correlative atom probe tomography (APT)/transmission electron microscope (TEM), we found that the buffer/absorber interface is not sharp but consists of an interfacial zone (2–6.5 nm wide) where a gradient of constituent elements belonging to the CdS buffer and CIGSe absorber appears. An enhanced short-range Cd in-diffusion inside the CIGSe was observed whenever a low Ga/(Ga + In) ratio (≤ 0.15) occurred at the interface. This might indicate the presence of Ga vacancies as a channeling defect for Cd in-diffusion inside the CIGSe layer leading to a buried p/n-homojunction. We evidence that a considerable amount of Cd is found inside the CIGSe layer at annealing temperatures higher than 150 °C. Further investigations of the elemental redistribution inside the CIGSe layer combined with C–V measurements support the formation of CdCu + donor like defects deep inside the p-type CIGSe which lead to a strong compensation of the CIGSe layer and hence to strong deterioration of cell efficiency at annealing temperatures higher than 200 °C. Hence, understanding the degradation processes in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe)-based solar cells opens new opportunities for further improvement of the long-term device performance.

Abstract: One of the ways to reduce the cost of solar electricity is to reduce the degradation rate of solar modules and extend their lifetime well beyond 30 years. The extended module lifetime translates to increased bankability of utility-scale PV projects. In this work, we specifically address cell-crack-induced degradation by introducing crack-tolerant metallization. We make use of low-cost, multi-walled carbon nanotubes embedded in commercial screen-printable silver pastes as a highly integratable engineering solution. When the carbon nanotubes are appropriately functionalized and incorporated into commercial silver pastes, the resulting metal contacts on solar cells, after screen-printing and firing, show exceptional fracture toughness. These composite metal contacts possess increased ductility, electrical gap-bridging capability greater than 50 μm, and “self-healing” to regain electrical continuity even after cycles of complete electrical failure under large strain. While providing crack-tolerant mechanical properties, the composite paste delivers similar beginning-of-life cell performance as the conventional silver paste.

Abstract: Maintaining a suitable temperature for the photovoltaic (PV) module is of great significance but a challenge. Herein, a low-supercooling phase change material (PCM) nanoemulsion was developed as a promising coolant for use in the PV module thermal management system. OP35E was used as the paraffinic PCM and the phase change characteristics and thermophysical properties of the as-prepared PCM nanoemulsions were investigated. It is shown that OP35E-nanoemulsions possess a melting point of roughly 34 °C and ignorable supercooling. The apparent specific heats of low-supercooling OP35E-nanoemulsions are 2.29–3.29 times that of water at the phase transition range, and its viscosities is slightly higher than that of water. Furthermore, the thermal management performance of water and OP35E-nanoemulsions on PV modules was evaluated. Compared with water, the PV module temperature further reduced by 5.3% when employing 20 wt% OP35E-nanoemulsion. More importantly, using 10 wt% and 20 wt% OP35E-nanoemulsions only required less than 50% of the pumping power consumption of the water-cooling system to reduce the PV module temperature to the same. On the contrary, owing to the lower apparent specific heat caused by the futile latent heat, the OP35E-nanoemulsion with large supercooling exhibited the worst thermal management performance with the highest PV module temperature and pumping power consumption, and lowest output power. Therefore, the outstanding characteristics and better cooling performance than water of the low-supercooling nanoemulsions make them show great potential in the PV module thermal management system as a novel kind of heat transfer fluids with improved specific heat.

Abstract: We present cell results and loss analysis summaries for screen printed, five-busbar (5BB), M2-size, n-type silicon solar cells made with rear-passivated contacts deposited with PECVD (referred to as ‘n-monoPoly’ cells). The PECVD process avoids the need to mask the front during the formation of the rear passivated contact. A median open circuit voltage (VOC) of 702 mV and a peak cell VOC of 705 mV was demonstrated. Improvements to the passivated contact stack led to a passivated rear surface recombination current density (J0-poly) of 5 fA/cm2 and an area-normalised rear metal recombination current density (J0-met) of 3 fA/cm2 for fire-through contacts. The cell models extracted from SolarEYE loss analysis were used to identify the largest VOC and FF losses. The best-fit cell model for 5BB n-monoPoly cells was used to: (i) project realistic 12 busbar (12BB) cell efficiencies; and (ii) simulate the output of the devices under bifacial operation. This 12BB n-monoPoly cell structure with a uniformly-doped p+ emitter has a median efficiency potential of 23.6%, and a potential bifacial output of 7 W with a rear irradiance factor of 0.3 – this would translate to an output of 12.5 W for M12-size wafers with the same rear irradiance. If a selectively-deposited passivated contact is added on the front, the median batch efficiency and VOC of screen-printed n-monoPoly cells can reach 24.7% and 720 mV for these 12BB devices.

Abstract: Background/Objective
Existing literature on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) is confounded by the inclusion of patients with secondary AML and t-MDS. We aim to report our 20-year experience of HSCT in t-AML.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed patients with t-AML who underwent HSCT. Patients were analyzed for prior malignancy, therapy, time to diagnosis of t-AML, transplant details, relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and predictors of outcomes.
Results
In total, 68 patients (59.9% female; median age, 56.5 years) underwent HSCT. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 39 (57.4%) and 23 (33.8%) patients, respectively. Cumulative incidence of relapse, nonrelapse mortality, RFS, and OS at 2 years were 17.9%, 34.5%, 47.6%, and 49.3%, respectively. Significant predictors of reduced OS were presence of 11q23 rearrangement (hazard ratio [HR], 3.24), using induction regimens other than FLAG-Ida or 7 + 3 (HR, 3.65), haploidentical donors (HR, 3.48), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2 or higher (HR, 5.83), and using cyclosporine A–methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis (HR, 2.41). A significant decrement in survival was seen with an increasing number of any of these prognostic factors.
Conclusion
Outcomes of t-AML are satisfactory after allo-HSCT. Patients with t-AML with good-risk karyotypes, good performance status, having HLA-matched donors, and receiving intensive induction regimens have better outcomes after HSCT.

Abstract: Form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) can provide containerless thermal energy storage with enhanced thermal conductivity relative to the pure PCMs. In the present work, the use of many different freeze-cast matrices (alumina, titania, carbon black, alumina/carbon black, chitosan, carbonized chitosan) is explored with many different PCMs (fatty acids, PEG, paraffin, esters, sugar alcohols, salt hydrates), to prepare a wide variety of form-stable phase change materials, using commodity materials. Materials were characterized by density, PCM fill, phase transition characteristics (melting point, enthalpy of fusion) including after melt-freeze cycling up to 1000 times, morphology (SEM), thermal conductivity and Vicker's hardness. The matrix did not substantially influence the PCM melting points, but did control the fill, thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of the form-stable PCMs. Alumina at a 38 mass% loading of PCM gave the best thermal conductivity, up to 3.2 W m−1 K−1, significantly enhanced compared with 0.15 W m−1 K−1 for the pure PCM, and with excellent hardness and mechanical stability after 1000 cycles. Chitosan and carbonized chitosan scaffolds gave form-stable PCMs with the highest PCM loading, up to 95 mass%.

Abstract: The design of flexible phase change textiles with photothermal conversion/storage performance provides a new direction for their potential applications in advanced solar energy storage. Herein, photothermal phase change microcapsules (microPCMs) were facilely prepared via surface modification of microPCMs with photothermal converter polypyrrole (PPy). A flexible photothermal phase change textile was further fabricated together with polyurethane (PU). The microPCMs coated with merely 1.91 wt% PPy exhibited high photothermal storage efficiency (up to 94.03%) under 1 solar irradiation and high melting enthalpy (231.6 J/g). Meanwhile, the microPCMs/PU composite fiber remained highly elastic (365% elongation) at a loading of 79.45 wt% microPCMs. Additionally, the photothermal phase change textile showed high cycling durability with essentially unchanged performance after 100 heating-cooling cycles. These favorable features of the composite textile grant it great potential for solar energy-related applications.

Abstract: Background
Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of hematologic malignancies with known vascular complications. The role race and ethnicity play in these complications is less defined. We aimed to further evaluate the role of race in patients without a history of previous thrombotic or hemorrhagic events.
Methods
In this retrospective study, 300 adult patients with MPN were included; 270 (90.0%) were White and 30 (10.0%) were non-White. The non-White group primarily consisted of African American or Black (26 patients), followed by others. Median age at diagnosis was 58 years for White patients and 61.5 years for non-White patients. The interaction between outcomes and vascular events with race was evaluated using multivariate logistical regression models.
Results
The incidence of thrombotic events was inversely correlated with age at diagnosis, with younger patients demonstrating a higher rate of thrombotic events over time (p < .001). The incidence of thrombotic or hemorrhagic events did not differ between White and non-White patients. A statistically significant difference in median survival was observed between White and non-White patients: 29 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.8–not reached) versus 13 years (95% CI: 5.7–22.7), respectively (p = .016).
Conclusion
This study did not find a significant difference in the rate of thrombotic or hemorrhagic events between White and non-White patients with MPN but suggested that non-White patients had significantly shorter median survival than White patients. Such observations may inform future studies to further characterize racial disparities in outcomes.

Abstract: Homocysteine (Hcy) is a strong and independent risk factor of atherosclerosis. It can accelerate atherosclerosis through increased production of inflammatory factors, especially interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), while the precise mechanisms remain to be well elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of the tumor suppressor gene SNF5 related to switch/sucrose non-fermentable complex (SWI/SNF) in the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis induced by Hcy. Using Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) atherosclerotic model with apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE−/−) mice fed with high-methionine diet, we showed that Hcy aggravates inflammation in macrophages during the atherosclerotic plaque formation. Further analysis showed that SNF5 promotes IL-1β expression and secretion. In addition, due to the existence of H3K4 methylation signals in the vicinity of IL-1β, we found that Hcy significantly promotes the expression of H3K4me1, and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (KDM1A) acts as a transcriptional repressor to regulate the expression of H3K4me1 by demethylating H3K4me1. In summary, our results demonstrated that Hcy up-regulates the expression of SNF5 through KDM1A, resulting in an increased level of H3K4me1 modification and IL-1β in macrophages, which in turn promotes the formation of atherosclerosis. Our study will provide more evidence for further revealing the specific mechanism of Hcy-induced inflammation and the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: The corrosion performance of water-based slurry aluminide coatings elaborated on iron- and nickel-based materials is investigated in molten chlorides as candidate heat transfer fluids (HTF) for thermal energy storage (TES) in third generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. This work presents a screening of four different materials (ferritic-martensitic P91 steel, austenitic stainless steel 316L, Inconel 600 and high-purity nickel) to investigate the influence of the alloying elements (e.g. Fe, Cr, Ni contents) on the microstructure and corrosion performance of slurry aluminide coatings. Individual metallic samples were diffusion-coated with slurries containing Al microparticles and subsequently exposed to molten NaCl–KCl at 700 °C for 100 h under argon. The experimental observations indicate that the performance of the aluminide coatings is governed by the precipitation of secondary phases within the B2 aluminide matrix rather than its intrinsic Al concentration (where B2 refers to either FeAl, (Fe,Ni)Al or NiAl intermetallic compounds). Of those, Fe-rich aluminide coatings were found to be more resistant to molten chlorides than Ni-rich ones. This is attributed to the greater solubility of Cr in iron aluminides than in nickel aluminides, preventing the precipitation of Cr-rich intermetallic compounds and/or Cr-rich carbides within the B2 matrix. Cr-rich phases were selectively dissolved upon exposure leaving the coating matrix with void channels. According to residual coating thickness measurements, the following ranking with increasing corrosion resistance can be given for Al-slurry coated materials: Inconel 600 < high-purity nickel < austenitic stainless steel 316L < ferritic-martensitic P91 steel.

Abstract: In this work, we derive and discuss the wafer bulk requirements for industrial amorphous/crystalline n-type silicon heterojunction cells. In particular, we investigate in detail the efficiency variations as a function of a) bulk carrier lifetime, b) dark resistivity, as well as c) the ratio of both quantities. To this end, we resort to finite element simulations to calculate how the I(V) parameters vary with the bulk properties listed above. In order to validate the simulation outputs, SHJ cells were processed from several wafer groups specially prepared to span wide ranges of bulk lifetimes and resistivities. Once validated, the simulation results are used to compute the wafer requirements as a function of the targeted efficiency, and the specifications derived therefrom are compared with literature. In this respect, the limits of the bulk lifetime/resistivity ratio, often employed to discuss wafer specifications, are highlighted. Combining the established requirements with statistical data from mass production of Czochralski ingots, we then assess whether or not nowadays commercially available monocrystalline wafers allow for a stable production of high efficiency devices. From a wafer manufacturer's standpoint, we quantify for a fixed cell structure, the room for efficiency improvement expected with further progresses in wafer bulk properties. Last, we also provide an outlook on how wafer requirements shall evolve with cell efficiency up to 25%.

Abstract: We study the mitigation of light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID) with high-intensity illumination treatments, placing special emphasis on inline feasibility. After the treatments, we investigate the stability upon degradation conditions close to the recently suggested standard, which allows estimating the LeTID behavior during the operating lifetime of solar modules in the field. Subsequently, we map the stability at different treatment intensities and temperatures achievable with an air-cooled tool. We show that, when applying short treatment times, the stability improves with increasing treatment intensity and deteriorates steeply with rising temperature above an optimum region around 250 °C. However, these intensity- and temperature-dependent differences largely vanish when increasing the treatment time sufficiently. We also investigate the significance of darkness/illumination during the cooling ramp from the treatment temperature in view of the LeTID stability. We discuss our results based on suggested defect models of LeTID, and provide hypotheses of the origin of the instabilities observed at the high treatment temperatures. After identifying optimal treatments, we demonstrate that the energy yield loss due to LeTID reduces by over 60% after an inline-feasible process consisting of only 30 s of high-intensity illumination, combined with cooling of the samples from the process temperature under a lower-intensity illumination.

Abstract: As one of the most-successful n-type semiconductor material, cadmium sulfide (CdS) films have proven advantageous in thin film solar cells by a traditional chemical bath deposition (CBD) process. However, the CBD process generates large quantities of waste containing Cd2+, S2− and ammonia. Metal-organic solution coating method (MOSC) shows the outstanding advantages in fabrication metal sulfide thin films, such as the less waste during film fabrication, low preparation cost and high-productivity of raw material. Herein, pinhole-free, crack-free and uniform CdS thin films were made by MOSC and CBD, then served as the buffer layers of superstrate Sb2Se3 solar cells, respectively. The Sb2Se3 solar cells exhibit impressive conversion efficiency of 5.93%, demonstrating the great potential of MOSC to replace the traditional CBD process.

Abstract: We have developed a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) free photoelectrochromic device with fast kinetics. The device can be colored fully in 3 min and bleach 95% within 30 min in dark. The addition of Pt catalyst in the WO3 layer catalyzes the back reaction in dark. The coloring is not affected by the addition of catalyst on the WO3 layer and the device shows the same amount of coloring as in the reference device. Both devices took 3 min to color completely but bleaching time was improved by a large margin. The reference device which does not have any Pt in WO3 or TiO2 layer takes 24 h to bleach fully compared to 30 min bleaching of Pt added device. The commercial feasibility of the device was checked by making a large area (60x48 cm2) prototype Further the thermal stability of the device was checked by keeping it under thermal stress at 65 °C. It was observed that the device was stable after 300 h. This device paves the way for commercializing the photoelectrochromic windows without the use of external power and transparent conducting oxide.

Abstract: To counter the underutilization and pollution relative to lignin, a novel strategy was adopted, where lignin was introduced as a modifier to enhance graphene aerogel (GA), resulting in the lignin-modified graphene aerogel (LGA) with an ultralow density (2.80 g/cm3). With the help of lignin, a well-defined 3D porous structure was successfully constructed in LGA with homogenous distribution of lignin, which was beneficial for supporting and extending GA skeleton that originally displayed significant shrinkage. The LGA skeleton achieved an extraordinarily high absorption of PEG (~99.0 wt%), which was higher than that of GA-based form-stable phase change materials whose absorption rate was already topped. Meantime, PEG@LGA exhibited not only reinforced light absorption in the whole light range from NIR to UV light benefitting to solar-to-thermal conversion, but also improved thermal stability and reusability as well as high latent heat efficiency (96.71%) and relative latent heat efficiency (98.41%). The material shows great potentials in energy storage and thermal management whose fabrication method at the same time paves a facile way for lignin utilization and valorization.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Recurrent somatic mutations in the JAK2, calreticulin (CALR), and the MPL genes are described as drivers of BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) that includes polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and MPN unclassified (MPN-U).
Methods
We describe the mutation profile and clinical features of MPN cases diagnosed at a tertiary care center. JAK2V617F and MPL (S505/W515) mutations were screened by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, while CALR exon 9 and JAK2 exon 12 mutations were screened by fragment analysis/Sanger sequencing. Among the 1,570 patients tested for these mutations during the study period, 407 were classified as MPN with a diagnosis of PV, ET, PMF, and MPN-U seen in 30%, 17%, 36%, and 17%, respectively, screened.
Results
Similar to previous reports from Asian countries, the incidence of PMF was the highest among the classic MPN. JAK2V617F mutation was detected in 90% of PV, 38% of ET, 48% of PMF, and 65% of MPN-U. JAK2 exon 12 mutations were seen in 5.7% of PV and 1.4% of PMF. CALR exon 9 mutations were seen in 33% of ET, 33% of PMF, and 12% of MPN-U. MPL mutations were detected in 2.8%, 2.7%, and 2.9% of ET, PMF, and MPN-U, respectively. Fifteen % of PMF, 26% of ET, and 22% of MPN-U were triple negative.
Conclusion
There was a significantly higher incidence of CALR mutation in PMF and ET cases. Our study highlights the challenges in the diagnosis of JAK2-negative PV and the need for harmonization of criteria for the same.

Abstract: The impact of non-uniform illumination on triple junction solar cells equipped with either refractive or reflective optics without secondary optical elements is characterised by varying the concentrator-to-receiver distance. Indoor experiments covering both electrical measurements and photographs with a charge-coupled device camera are performed. The non-uniformities are examined by differentiating two spectral bands, those affecting the top and middle subcells. This allows the irradiance and spectral distributions to be analysed. The analysis is complemented with ray tracing simulations. Results show a different behaviour for the refractive and reflective systems. Irradiance non-uniformities in the case of the reflective system around the on-focus position are higher than those measured in the refractive system. However, the spectral non-uniformities that characterise the refractive system constitute only a residual effect in the reflective system. The drop in the solar cell fill factor caused by non-uniformities is mainly driven by the degradation of the slope of the I–V curve near the short-circuit point in the case of the refractive system, while it is mainly driven by the degradation of the slope of the I–V curve near the open-circuit point in the case of the reflective system. Both systems are very sensitive to the concentrator-to-receiver distance, a critical parameter that must be accurately designed in any concentrator system. The findings will allow the trade-off between increasing performance and increasing cost strategies to mitigate the non-uniformities in concentrator photovoltaic systems to be better evaluated.

Abstract: Quantitative assessment of protein complexes, such as receptor clusters in the context of cellular signalling, has become a pressing objective in cell biology. The advancements in the field of single molecule fluorescence microscopy have led to different approaches for counting protein copy numbers in various cellular structures. This has resulted in an increasing interest in robust calibration protocols addressing photophysical properties of fluorescent labels and the effect of labelling efficiencies. Here, we want to give an update on recent methods for protein counting with a focus on novel calibration protocols. In this context, we discuss different types of calibration samples and identify some of the challenges arising in molecular counting experiments. Some recently published applications offer potential approaches to tackle these challenges.

Abstract: Introduction
SIRT4 is a mitochondrial sirtuin. Owing to its dependance on the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), SIRT4 can act as a mitochondrial metabolic sensor of cellular energy status. We have previously shown that enhancement of mitochondrial functions is vital for the odontogenic diﬀ ;erentiation of dental papilla cells (DPCs) during dentinogenesis. However, whether SIRT4 serves as an effective regulator of DPC diﬀ ;erentiation by affecting mitochondrial functions remains unexplored.
Methods
Primary DPCs obtained from the first molar dental papilla of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. The expression pattern of SIRT4 was observed by immunohistochemistry in the first molar of postnatal day 1 (P1) rats. The changes in SIRT4 expression during odontogenic DPC differentiation were evaluated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting, and immunofluorescence. DPCs with loss (small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown) and gain (plasmid transfection-induced overexpression) of SIRT4 function were used to explore the role of SIRT4 in odontogenic differentiation. Mitochondrial function assays were performed using ATP, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and NAD+/NADH kits to investigate the potential mechanisms involved in SIRT4-mediated dentinogenesis.
Results
In the present study, we found that SIRT4 expression increased in a time-dependent manner during odontogenic differentiation bothin vivo and in vitro. Sirt4 knockdown resulted in reduced odontogenic differentiation and mineralization, whereas an opposite effect was observed with SIRT4 overexpression. Furthermore, our results verified that in addition to reducing DPC differentiation, Sirt4 knockdown could also significantly reduce ATP levels, elevate the NAD+/NADH ratio, and increase ROS levels.
Conclusion
SIRT4 regulates mitochondrial functions and the antioxidant capacity of DPCs, thereby influencing dentin formation and tooth development, a phenomenon that may provide a foundation for better understanding the specific molecular mechanisms underlying dentin regeneration.

Abstract: Background
Beta-thalassemia is a genetic disorder that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This genetic disease leads to a defective beta-globin hemoglobin chain causing partial or complete beta-globin chain synthesis loss. Beta-thalassemia major patients need a continuous blood transfusion and iron chelation to maintain the normal homeostasis of red blood cells (RBCs) and other systems in the body. Patients also require treatment procedures that are costly and tedious, resulting in a serious health burden for developing nations such as Nepal.
Methods
A total of 61 individuals clinically diagnosed to have thalassemia were genotyped with multiplex amplification refractory mutation system–polymerase chain reaction (ARMS–PCR). Twenty-one major mutations were investigated using allele-specific primers grouped into six different panels.
Results
The most common mutations found (23%) were IVS 1–5 (G-C) and Cd 26 (G-A) (HbE), followed by 619 deletion, Cd 8/9 (+G), Cd 16 (–C), Cd 41/42 (–TTCT), IVS 1–1 (G–T), Cd 19 (A-G), and Cd 17 (A-T) at 20%, 12%, 8%, 6%, 4%, 3%, and 1%, respectively.
Conclusion
The results of this study revealed that Nepal's mutational profile is comparable to that of its neighboring countries, such as India and Myanmar. This study also showed that thalassemia could be detected across 17 Nepal's ethnic groups, especially those whose ancestors originated from India and Central Asia.

Abstract: Solid tumours modify their metabolic strategy to ensure sufficient biomass and energy to maintain a high rate of proliferation. However, solid tumours are characterised by a high proportion of quiescent cells and little is known about their metabolic profile. A tumour spheroid model with DLD1 cells was used to investigate the influence of a quiescent state on the cellular utilisation of glucose and glutamine. Quiescent DLD1 spheroids displayed increased depletion of both nutrients from the bathing medium compared to their proliferative counterparts and displayed highly active overall metabolism. A combination of biochemical and metabolomics approaches demonstrated that glucose utilisation resulted in an increased production of the 3-carbon intermediates lactate and alanine in quiescent spheroids. In addition, glutamine metabolism was directed to anabolic pathways; including the “reverse TCA cycle” to produce citrate for fatty-acid synthesis. These adaptations in DLD1 spheroids may propose a metabolic altruism of quiescent regions in solid tumours to provide biosynthetic intermediates required to sustain tumour growth, angiogenesis and metastasis.

Abstract: Solar steam generation (SSG) has emerged as one of renewable and environmentally friendly technologies for production of fresh water. Here, we demonstrate the preparation of a novel oil-repellent photothermal materials based on copper foam (CF) for efficient SSG. Only by a simple chemical oxidation treatment on CF (named as R–CF), the smooth CF skeleton changes to be rough, leading to an enhanced light absorption of up to 90% which is far higher than that of untreated CF (10–70%). By combination of its high porosity (89.6%) and high specific surface area (230 m2 g−1), the R–CF shows superior ability on SSG as well as salt-resistance, i.e., its evaporation efficiency in water and high saline solution reaches 85.25% and 70.19% under 1 kW m−2 irradiation, respectively. In addition, R–CF was further treated by a surface chemical modification to achieve hydrophilicity while oil-repellent wettability (named as OR-R-CF), enabling it solar vaporization even in oily water, e.g., an evaporation efficiency of 77.0% was obtained in oily water, which is great advantageous to those existing photothermal materials usually suffer the drawbacks of poor oil-repellent or anti-fouling property and thus shows significant potentials for practical SSG applications in both seawater and oily water.

Abstract: The thermal and electrical performance of the innovative solar thermionic-thermoelectric generator (ST2G) has been carefully analyzed by using a high-flux solar simulator. Specific technological solutions have been integrated with respect to the first prototype for the operational testing at the moderate temperature range of 700–1000 K. The influence of spacers with different thickness has been studied to quantify the reduction of output current due to space-charge effect, whereas a BaF2-based coating has been deposited on the anode to make its work function (~2.1 eV) approach the cathode one, on which a hydrogen-terminated nitrogen doped nano-diamond film acts as emitter (work function of ~2.0 eV). The engineered ceramic absorber has demonstrated to be a reliable selective solar absorber with a high solar-to-thermal efficiency of 84% for solar concentration ratio of 200 suns, extrapolated to 83% at 500 suns. As expected, the thermionic energy converter still provides a small converted power. However, the minimum inter-electrode spacing used (50 μm) and the engineered anode allow to better figure out the present limitations in the electrical power generation and how to surpass them in the near future.

Abstract: The cavity wall is an important part of a cavity receiver in determining the receiver efficiency. Using solar selective reflector (SSR) materials with low solar absorptivity and high thermal emissivity for the cavity wall design is one efficient way to improve the receiver efficiency. In this work, we present a systematic study of the optical and high-temperature stability performances of six different SSR materials: one refractory ceramic fiber based substrate material (Fiberfrax 140) and five metallic oxide coatings which are prepared by mixing metallic oxide powders of alumina, magnesium oxide and titanium dioxide with commercial inorganic adhesives. The thermal stability was studied by heating up and keeping the six candidate materials in atmospheric conditions at a temperature of 1250 °C for 200 h. The spectrum of hemispherical reflectance in the spectrum band 0.25–25 μm was measured for analyzing the optical performance of the candidate materials. The obtained results show that all the six materials studied have good solar selective reflection characteristics, i.e, low solar absorptivity and relatively high thermal emissivity. Especially, the alumina coated substrate material shows excellent performances both for thermal stability and solar selective reflection. The solar reflectivity can reach 94.6%.

Abstract: The perovskite solar cell technology is showing rapid progress in delivering high power conversion efficiency. This is not limited to conventional 1 SUN illumination, but state-of-the-art results have also been also demonstrated for a low-light condition such as indoor illumination. In this work, we show that very efficient low-light perovskite solar cells can be realized in the inverted configuration with the use of NiO as a hole transporting material by employing a conventional high-temperature process (300 °C, compact NiO) or a low-temperature process (<100 °C) based on nanoparticle NiO. The power density of 90.2 μW/cm2 at 1000 lux was achieved for compact NiO device, while 71.6 μW/cm2 was obtained with nanoparticle NiO cells under the same illumination. A detailed electrical, optical, and morphological characterization permitted to identify the reasons for the difference between compact and nanoparticle NiO. Beside the difference in power density, nanoparticle NiO permitted to realize the first low temperature inorganic hole transporting layer for low-light p-i-n perovskite solar cell and, as we show, this could be easily scaled up to 1 cm2 without suffering for performance losses moving from small to large area.

Abstract: Solar-driven interface evaporation has received much attention due to its high-efficiency photothermal conversion efficiency. However, in practical application, it is difficult to monitor whether the evaporation efficiency of photothermal conversion materials can maintain high efficiency and stability for a long time. In this paper, taking surface modified coconut fiber (SCF) as photothermal material, we designed a set of evaporation efficiency monitoring device (EEMD) and demonstrated the strategy of building a solar evaporation efficiency monitoring system. The SCF shows superhydrophilic wettability, and its vertical multi-stage open-framework structure is benefit to the rapid transport of water. Under 1 kW m−2 illumination, evaporation rate of SCF is 1.5 kg m−2 h−1, evaporation efficiency is 90.2%. In 20% NaCl, evaporation rate of SCF is 1.37 kg m−2 h−1, and energy conversion efficiency is 85.3%. In order to monitor the stability of evaporator efficiency, we designed a simple EEMD which applied platinum wire electrode to monitor the change of electric potential in the evaporator. The results show that the electric potential is positively correlated with the evaporation efficiency. EEMD provides a new monitoring method for the efficient and stable operation of solar evaporator.

Abstract: Photovoltaic module degradation from a high system voltage is a prevalent degradation mode in the field, where the enabling degradation mechanisms are inherently dependent on the voltage bias polarity of the installed system. Here, the effects of positive bias on module performance are confirmed and the underlying chemical degradation processes are more thoroughly investigated to reveal different degradation pathways from those previously reported in negative bias studies. When cells are under +1000 V stress, crystalline silicon mini-modules with poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) encapsulant demonstrated a significant photocurrent loss due to EVA discoloration and delamination from increased chemical reactivity at the front-side EVA/cell metallization interface. Brown discoloration of the EVA encapsulant near the cell gridlines is linked to an electrochemical reaction at the Ag gridlines under hot and humid conditions (85 °C, 85% relative humidity). Chemical compositional analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that the discoloration is attributed to the formation of silver sulfide (Ag2S) and/or silver oxide (Ag2O) species at the EVA/Ag gridline interface. The subsequent migration of Ag ions from the cell gridlines into the bulk of the EVA was evident from XPS depth profiling and optical microscopy. However, the Ag signal was not detected at the EVA/glass interface, inferring limited ionic transport through the nominally 0.45 mm thick encapsulant. For the samples studied herein, the sulfur is believed by the process of elimination to come from the ambient air, diffusing into the module through the permeable polymer backsheet.

Abstract: Thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) is a non-crosslinking material used in photovoltaic module encapsulation. TPO thermal degradation and its weather stabilities are still not known. In this work, TPO laminates were prepared and subjected to extended damp-heat weather test. TPO encapsulant properties were studied and compared with the most commonly used encapsulant, Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA). Four times lower rate of transmittance loss and increment rate in the yellowness index values have been found for TPO compared to EVA laminate. Damp-heat induced degradation mechanism, and its components were studied using Raman and Fourier-transform-infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Raman spectra revealed that the carbonyl group loss rate at the edge is one order of magnitude higher than the center. FTIR has shown a higher rate of acetic acid and hydroxyl group formation in EVA as compared to the TPO. FTIR also demonstrated that TPO has a lower water absorption because of its nonpolar nature, whereas EVA shows more water absorption due to its polar nature. The rate of change in thermal properties of TPO and EVA encapsulants were studied through the heat-cool-heat cycle. A higher rate of increment in the degree of crystallinity is found for EVA as compared to the TPO encapsulant during the extended damp-heat acceleration test. This study helps to understand the TPO and EVA encapsulants degradation behavior, degradation components, and mechanism to the encapsulant researchers and PV module manufacturers when a PV module experiences the hot-humid conditions. This TPO may result in the industry adopting the different PV modules for fabricating.

Abstract: In this article, we look, from the carrier perspective, at the effect of the double grading in a CIGS absorber, in order to understand its benefit compared to a single grading. We focus on the double grading effects on the conduction band edge, generation rate and carrier collection. We first show that, when the minimum bandgap position (notch position) is outside of the absorber depletion region, a local maximum of the conduction band edge appears at the back of the depletion region, creating a hump, which hinders the collection of electrons. Interpreting the effect of the grading as an effective electric field, we show that the hump is caused by the competition between the absorber internal electric field and the grading created effective electric field. From this, we deduce that the notch should be positioned in the depletion region. As expected, the generation rate increases significantly at the notch position. However, studying carrier collection and the recombination rate, we show that, even if in the ideal case we should observe a total collection of carriers generated in the depletion region, the recombination rate in the SCR increases significantly when the notch is in it. We propose that this is caused by the increased carrier generation close to recombination centres. The ideal notch position is, therefore, a compromise between being close enough to the front to have a maximal carrier collection and avoiding the creation of a hump, while minimizing the carrier recombination.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) has attracted intense attention because of its positive contribution to sustainable energy utilization. To improve the TES performance of sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT), the combined use of cellulose nanofibril (CNF) and graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) was investigated to tackle the phase separation problem and to improve the thermal conductivity of SAT. Phase stability and rheology tests revealed that adding 0.8% of CNF to SAT increased viscosity, enhanced solid-like rheological behavior, and successfully eliminated phase separation. Meanwhile, the amphiphilicity of CNF facilitated the dispersion of GNP. Sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate (DSP; Na2HPO4·12H2O) was selected as the nucleating agent, which reduced the supercooling degree of SAT to 2.1 °C. Phase change materials (PCMs) were prepared by simply blending GNP pre-dispersed with CNF, DSP, and SAT. Due to the excellent thermal performance of GNP and its good dispersion by CNF, the prepared PCM composites showed enhanced thermal conductivity compared with that of pure SAT. Thermal reliability testing indicated that the melting point and enthalpy of the prepared PCM composites decreased after 100 melting/freezing cycles. Overall, PCM composites with enhanced performance were fabricated based on renewable, bio-based, and biodegradable nanocellulose. These composites can be used for certain TES applications.

Abstract: Natural soiling of photovoltaic (PV) panel is an increasing problem especially in arid and desert areas. Finding a strategy that can reduce dust adhesion on PV panels is highly desirable but remains challenging. In this paper, different wettability of transparent coatings including superhydrophilic, hydrophilic, hydrophobic and superhydrophobic coatings were prepared to investigate the importance of surface roughness and surface energy. Their anti-soiling effects were investigated under different airflow velocity and different tilt angles. Dust deposition density, reduced transmittance, the ratio of reduced transmittance between bare glass surfaces and coatings, and PV efficiency reduction were used to characterize dust resistance performances. It is found that dust adhesion on superhydrophilic coatings was eminently governed by their respective high surface energy, with surface roughness rendering lesser contribution towards resisting/adhering effects. However, for other three coatings, further reducing the surface energy had little influence on the improvement of dust-proof ability. A large airflow velocity is beneficial to resist dust adhesion for all four types of coatings. However, a large airflow velocity has a limited ability to improve the anti-soiling effect of superhydrophilic coating under different tilt angles compared with other three coatings. The anti-soiling coatings can be referred to hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings, not limited to superhydrophobic coating only. The study provides an invaluable guiding significance for preparation of dust-resistant coatings.

Abstract: Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) glazings are promising technologies with the benefits of electricity generation, solar shading and building energy savings. A new approach is to integrate BIPV windows with thermotropic materials such as Hydroxypropyl Cellulose (HPC) hydrogel, which offers adaptive advantages for the systems to respond to time-varying weather conditions but also enhances the PV electricity generation. To design such systems, knowledge of the temperature-dependent scattering properties of the selected thermotropic materials is of significance. In this study, a Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) smart window system consisting of a thermotropic membrane synthesised using HPC and gellan gum gelling agent for electricity generation and also solar control has been designed and investigated. An advanced optical model, which combines a Monte-Carlo ray-tracing technique with an Inverse Adding-Doubling (IAD) method, has been developed for characterising the thermotropic membrane in terms of angular scattering distribution under various membrane temperatures and HPC concentrations. Then the developed optical model has been validated by comparison with experimental measurements. Subsequently, the validated optical model has been used to design and optimise the proposed BIPV smart window. The effects of HPC concentration, geometric concentration ratio, thermotropic membrane thickness and glass refractive index on PV power outputs have been evaluated. Finally, a prototype of the BIPV smart window with a 6 wt% HPC membrane has been manufactured and tested under indoor conditions. From the experimental tests, it was found that the total transmittance of the double-pane glass sample with a 6 wt% HPC membrane layer decreases from approximately 90%to 14%, when the membrane temperature increases from 27 °C to 56 °C. The measured short-circuit current for the prototype BIPV smart window is up to 1.15 times higher than that of its counterpart system with a similar PV area but no membrane.

Abstract: The reasons behind the long-term degradation of Cu-doped CdTe thin-film solar cells have been a topic of discussion for almost two decades. Yet the underlying mechanisms of such degradation, especially interactions of Cu doping with Cl in high-performance CdSeTe devices, still lack detailed understanding. In this study, we provide a consistent theoretical analysis of the fundamental physics behind this phenomenon. We then identify the dominant device degradation mechanism that cannot be completely eliminated in Cu-doped chlorinated CdSeTe-based PV. Finally, we conclude that this key mechanism is absent in CdSeTe PV when using arsenic absorber doping, which explains the remarkable stability demonstrated by this new technology. Theoretical conclusions are supported by the results of accelerated life tests on Cu- and As-doped chlorinated CdSeTe cells.

Abstract: Developing cheap and efficient materials for enhancing the photochromic performance upon visible or solar light irradiation is a hot-topic in the field of solar energy conversion. However, few inorganic photochromic materials can provide satisfying applications due to their low coloring and bleaching efficiency as well as slight color change. Here, we synthesized the bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) ultrathin nanosheets with the thickness of 1.29 nm via co-precipitation-hydrothermal method using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant. The prepared ultrathin nanosheets show the similar crystalline structure but a narrowed band gap of 2.73 eV, as compared with the 2.86 eV of pristine Bi2WO6. Additionally, the numerous [WO6–xBr2x] species and abundant “Bi–O″ vacancy pairs on the surface can serve as active sites that suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and capture the photogenerated electrons to form the color trapping centers. As a result, Bi2WO6 ultrathin nanosheets exhibit excellent photochromic behavior upon solar light irradiation (coloring time of 5 s) and under dark atmospheric treatment (bleaching time of 35 min) compared with WO3-based photochromic materials (coloring time of 20–60 min and bleaching time of 3 h days).

Abstract: Ferroptosis, a newly iron-dependent form of cell death, is often accompanied by the damage of membrane lipid peroxide. Recently, the ferroptosis inducer erastin has been reported to exhibit potential anti-cancer activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of SRSF9 on the sensitivity of colorectal cancer (CRC) to erastin and explore the underlying molecular mechanism. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or SRSF9 overexpression vector (SRSF9-OE) was transfected into erastin-induced human CRC cells to inhibit or overexpress SRSF9. Results showed that SRSF9 inhibition promoted the cell death induced by erastin, conversely, SRSF9 overexpression augmented the resistance to erastin-induced death in human CRC cells. SRSF9 decreased lipid peroxide damage which was a key event during erastin-induced ferroptosis in human CRC cells. Furthermore, we found that SRSF9 inhibition increased erastin-induced ferroptosis by downregulating GPX4 level. In an In vivo study, SRSF9 shRNA or SRSF9-OE stably transfected human CRC cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of nude mice. SRSF9 overexpression partly abolished the tumor growth inhibition and ferroptosis induced by erastin. Our data indicated SRSF9's regulation of GPX4 as an essential mechanism driving CRC tumorigenesis and resistance of erastin-induced ferroptosis. This molecular mechanism may provide a novel method for improving the sensitivity of CRC to erastin.

Abstract: Netrin-4, recognized in neural and vascular development, is highly expressed by mature endothelial cells. The function of this netrin-4 in vascular biology after development has remained unclear. We found that the expression of netrin-4 is highly regulated in endothelial cells and is important for quiescent healthy endothelium. Netrin-4 expression is upregulated in endothelial cells cultured under laminar flow conditions, while endothelial cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor alpha resulted in decreased netrin-4 expression. Targeted reduction of netrin-4 in endothelial cells resulted in increased expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Besides, these endothelial cells were more prone to monocyte adhesion and showed impaired barrier function, measured with electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, as well as in an ‘organ-on-a-chip’ microfluidic system. Importantly, endothelial cells with reduced levels of netrin-4 showed increased expression of the senescence-associated markers cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1 and -2A, an increased cell size and decreased ability to proliferate. Consistent with the gene expression profile, netrin-4 reduction was accompanied with more senescent associated β-galactosidase activity, which could be rescued by adding netrin-4 protein. Finally, using human decellularized kidney extracellular matrix scaffolds, we found that pre-treatment of the scaffolds with netrin-4 increased numbers of endothelial cells adhering to the matrix, showing a pro-survival effect of netrin-4. Taken together, netrin-4 acts as an anti-senescence and anti-inflammation factor in endothelial cell function and our results provide insights as to maintain endothelial homeostasis and supporting vascular health.

Abstract: Objective
Obesity is now a worldwide disease and is mainly attributable to increased body fat deposition. In a growing number of epidemiological studies, lutein has been revealed to have different degrees of anti-obesity properties, but the potential underlying mechanisms that have been reported are limited. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the protective effects of lutein against excessive lipid accumulation, and we explored the role of SIRT1 and SIRT1-mediated pathways both in abdominal adipose tissue and mature 3T3-L1 cells during lutein administration.
Methods
In our design, male Sprague–Dawley rats were fed either control or high-fat diets with or without 25 mg/kg·bw/day lutein for 5 weeks. Additionally, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were incubated with 40 μM lutein or 10 μM Ex527 for 24 h.
Results
Lutein supplementation decreased the body weight, abdominal fat index ratio, frequency and mean area of larger adipocytes in HE staining induced by the high-fat diet and then activated the expression of SIRT1 and thus upregulated FoxO1, ATGL, and HSL expression and downregulated SREBP-1, FAS, and ACC expression both in abdominal adipose tissue and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. However, coincubation with Ex527 and lutein suppressed the activation of SIRT1 and reversed the expression of FoxO1, ATGL, HSL, SREBP-1, FAS, and ACC in comparison to those in the Lut group.
Conclusions
Overall, we suggest that the effects of lutein on attenuating excessive lipid accumulation are dependent on the SIRT1-mediated pathway in vivo and in vitro, which indicates that lutein administration may be a potential strategy for preventing excessive lipid accumulation and obesity.

Abstract: Objective/Background: Lymphoma is seen as a highly treatable and curable malignancy with aggressive treatment methods. Efficacy is often limited by toxicity and many patients need alternative treatment strategies as they cannot tolerate existing high cytotoxic approaches. Our aim is to compare BEAM [carmustine (BCNU), etoposide, cytarabine (ARA-C, cytosine arabinoside), and melphalan] and mitoxantrone–melphalan (Mx-Mel) regimens utilized in our patients with a diagnosis of lymphoma who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), and to demonstrate that the Mx-Mel regimen has similar but less toxic results than the BEAM regimen we have been using frequently as standard conditioning regimen.
Methods
A total of 101 patients with lymphoma who underwent ASCT were included in our study. The BEAM regimen included BCNU, etoposide, ARA-C, and melphalan. The Mx-Mel regimen included mitoxantrone and melphalan.
Results
Of 101 patients included in the study, 60 (59.4%) received BEAM and 41 (40.6%) received Mx-Mel (40.6%) conditioning regimen. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 10 (range: 9–20) days and 12 (range: 9–12) days in the BEAM and Mx-Mel arms, respectively; it was statistically significantly shorter in the BEAM arm (p = .001).
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that the Mx-Mel regimen has similar efficacy and toxicity compared with the BEAM regimen. Although time to neutrophil engraftment was shorter in the BEAM arm, it did not result as significant transplant-related complications between the two regimens. The Mx-Mel regimen is seen as a good alternative with low toxicity and high efficacy.

Abstract: The parameters governing the performance of a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) are determined for sputtered thin-films of NaI:Tm2+, CaBr2:Tm2+, and CaI2:Tm2+. These parameters are determined by using six gradient thin film material libraries, combinatorially sputtered from metallic and pressed powder targets. These films show strong 4f13→4f12d1 absorption of maximally 752cm−1 at.%−1 for NaI:Tm2+, 31cm−1 at.%−1 for CaBr2:Tm2+, and 473cm−1 at.%−1 for CaI2:Tm2+. This absorption covers the entire visible spectrum and does not overlap with the infrared 4f-4f emission at 1140nm. Decay measurements are used to estimate the quantum yields of the thin-films. These quantum yields can be as high as 44% for NaI:Tm2+, when doped with 0.3at.% Tm. Even at doping percentages as low as 0.3at.%, the films appear to show luminescence quenching. The concentration-dependent absorption and quantum yield are combined with the index of refraction, resolved from transmission measurements, to simulate the optical efficiency of a thin film Tm2+-doped halide LSC. These simulations show that LSCs based on Tm2+ can display excellent color rendering indices of up to 99%, and neutral color temperatures, between 4500K and 6000K. Under optimal conditions, thin-films constrained to a thickness of 10μm and 80% transmission of the visible spectrum, would be able to display optical efficiencies of 0.71%. This optical efficiency compares favorably to the maximally achievable 3.5% under these constraints. This efficiency is largely independent of the size of LSC itself.

Abstract: Introduction
The oral cavity is one of the most common sites impacted by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with acute complications including mucositis, bleeding, salivary gland dysfunction, infection, and taste alteration. These complications may result in significant morbidity and can negatively impact outcomes such as length of stay and overall costs. As such, oral care during HSCT for prevention and management of oral toxicities is a standard component of transplant protocols at all centers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the current oral care practices for patients during HSCT at different transplant centers within the Eastern Mediterranean region.
Material and methods
An internet-based survey was directed to 30 transplant centers in the Eastern Mediterranean region. The survey included five sections asking questions related to (1) transplant center demographics; (2) current oral care protocol used at the center and type of collaboration (if any) with a dental service; (3) use of standardized oral assessment tools and grading systems for mucositis; (4) consultations for management of oral complications; and (5) oral health needs at each center. Data are presented as averages and percentages.
Results
A total of 16 responses from 11 countries were collected and analyzed, indicating a response rate of 53%. Eight centers reported that a dentist was part of the HSCT team, with four reporting oral medicine specialists specifically being part of the team. Almost all centers (15/16; 93%) had an affiliated dental service to facilitate pre-HSCT dental clearance with an established dental clearance protocol at 14 centers (87%). Dental extraction was associated with the highest concern for bleeding and the need for platelet transfusion. With respect to infection risk, antibiotic prophylaxis was considered in the setting of low neutrophil counts with restorative dentistry and extraction. All centers provide daily reinforcement of oral hygiene regimen. The most frequently used mouth oral rinses included sodium bicarbonate (68%) and chlorhexidine gluconate (62%), in addition to ice chips for dry mouth (62%). The most frequently used mucositis assessment tools were the World Health Organization scale (7/16; 43%) and visual analogue scale for pain (6/16; 37%). Mucositis pain was managed with lidocaine solution (68.8%), magic mouth wash (68.8%) and/or systemic pain medications (75%).
Conclusions
Scope and implementation of oral care protocols prior to and during HSCT varied between transplant centers. The lack of a universal protocol may contribute to gaps in oral healthcare needs and management for this group of patients. Further dissemination of and education around available oral care guidelines is warranted. Clinical relevance. Considering oral care during HSCT a standard component of transplant protocols, the current study highlights the common oral care practices for patients at centers within the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Abstract: Chronic liver injury is characterised by continuous or repeated epithelial cell loss and inflammation. Hepatic wound healing involves matrix deposition through activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and the expansion of closely associated Ductular Reactions and liver progenitor cells (LPCs), which are thought to give rise to new epithelial cells. In this study, we used the murine thioacetamide (TAA) model to reliably mimic these injury and regeneration dynamics and assess the impact of a recovery phase on subsequent liver injury and fibrosis. Age-matched naïve or 6-week TAA-treated/4-week recovered mice (C57BL/6 J, n = 5–9) were administered TAA for six weeks (C57BL/6 J, n = 5–9). Sera and liver tissues were harvested at key time points to assess liver injury biochemically, by real-time PCR for fibrotic mediators, Sirius Red staining and hydroxyproline assessment for collagen deposition as well as immunofluorescence for inflammatory, HSC and LPC markers. In addition, primary HSCs and the HSC cell line LX-2 were co-cultured with the well-characterised LPC line BMOL and analysed for potential changes in expression of fibrogenic mediators. Our data demonstrate that recovery from a previous TAA insult, with LPCs still present on day 0 of the second treatment, led to a reduced TAA-induced disease progression with less severe fibrosis than in naïve TAA-treated animals. Importantly, primary activated HSCs significantly reduced pro-fibrogenic gene expression when co-cultured with LPCs. Taken together, previous TAA injury established a fibro-protective molecular and cellular microenvironment. Our proof-of principle HSC/LPC co-culture data demonstrate that LPCs communicate with HSCs to regulate fibrogenesis, highlighting a key role for LPCs as regulatory cells during chronic liver disease.

Abstract: Silver-based metallizations in photovoltaic modules are susceptible to corrosion by acetic acid generated in ethylene vinyl acetate encapsulated modules, resulting in power losses over time. Here, three silver-based metallizations are exposed to diluted acetic acid, in concentrations representative of that found in field-exposed modules. Compositional, morphological, and structural changes of the metallizations are studied over 3000 h of exposure to diluted acetic acid using Raman spectroscopy mapping, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The three metallizations studied are: 1) a commercial high-temperature fire-through Ag paste, commonly used for Si diffused junction solar cells; 2) a commercial low-temperature paste normally used for silicon heterojunction cells; and 3) a novel low-temperature reactive silver ink shown to be suitable for photovoltaic applications. We find distinct corrosion rates for the high-temperature silver paste and reactive silver ink in the presence of diluted acetic acid. On the other hand, the low-temperature silver paste appears to be more corrosion resistant, likely due to a polymer layer that protects the silver particles.

Abstract: Passive radiative cooling without external energy input or environmental pollution is promising to be a serviceable strategy for energy saving. However, intense solar radiation seriously limits the performance of daytime radiative cooling. Here, a flexible and practical approach to reducing solar absorption of the emitters with a spectrally selective film (SSF) was proposed. The solar reflectivity of the SSF is 93%, while the IR transmissivity in the atmospheric window is 87%. Particularly, the SSF is hydrophobic, providing the film with resistance to the potential condensation problems. By covering with the SSF, black emitters achieved a consecutive 24-h sub-ambient radiative cooling. The temperature of the emitter surface decreased by 21.4 °C comparing to the bare ones at noon, with an average temperature drop of 3.1 °C below the ambient temperature. And higher average sub-ambient temperature drop of 4.8 °C was achieved by the improved experiment with convection shield. Additionally, the cooling performance for SSF with various emitters was also discussed. Commercial ESR film can achieve a cooling power of ~100 W/m2 with the SSF in arid areas. And the national-scale modeling in China showed that 85% of China's areas can achieve daytime sub-ambient radiative cooling by integrating with the proposed film. Thus, the scalable SSF can relax the requirements of solar reflection for emitters, providing a viable solution for daytime radiative cooling with simpler and cheaper emitters.

Abstract: Novel interconnect technologies leveraging low melting temperature solders, such as multiwire interconnects, are being deployed in photovoltaic (PV) modules for improved reliability through interconnect redundancy and lower thermal loads during interconnection and lamination. However, the equivalency of standardized accelerated testing to field conditions has not yet been established for these emerging technologies. In this study, the thermomechanical fatigue resistance of low temperature solder alloys is investigated and compared to that of conventional SnPb to assess the acceleration behavior of these alloys. While InSn is shown to have sufficient thermomechanical fatigue resistance on the order of that of SnPb, these results indicate Sn–Bi alloys may have poor thermomechanical fatigue resistance at field conditions. The results also show that Sn–Bi alloys have thermal cycling acceleration factors of less than one. This indicates that the standardized accelerated thermal cycling test, such as that in IEC 61215, will produce misleading results for Sn–Bi alloys and that unique testing is required for this PV module architecture. Though accelerated thermal cycling may be a meaningful qualification test for SnPb solder joints, these results suggest that mechanical loading may be a more appropriate test for Sn–Bi multiwire interconnects. This is due to the distinct processing and geometry of multiwire interconnects which may allow for mechanical, rather than strictly metallurgical interconnections.

Abstract: In recent years the efficiency of CdTe based solar cells has been significantly improved, mainly by the increase of the short circuit current value. This has been achieved by removing the CdS window layer and by adding a CdSexTe1-x layer, grading the band gap of the CdTe. On the other hand, ultra-thin absorbers allow to reduce the materials impact in terms of availability, cost and environmental impact. In this paper we present and study the fabrication of an ultra-thin CdTe based device with band gap grading. Moreover, we present a novel method to generate CdSexTe1-x compounds: by annealing a thin part of the absorber layer in a selenium atmosphere (selenization). This technique allows to narrow the absorber band gap to 1.41 eV, to obtain the desired selenium profile and to considerably increase the external quantum efficiency at long wavelengths. We observe a large increase in the spectral response and an explicit improvement in the short circuit current for CdTe cells with an absorber thickness of 2 μm and without CdS. Current density values of 26 mA/cm2 have been achieved, which are the highest reported for thin CdTe absorbers.

Abstract: Reducing the formation of cracks during growth of GaInP/GaInAs/Ge 3-junction solar cells on Ge|Si virtual substrates has been attempted by thinning the structure, namely the Ge bottom cell and the GaInAs middle cell. The theoretical analysis performed using realistic device parameters indicates that the GaInAs middle cell can be drastically thinned to 1000 nm while increasing its In content to 8% with an efficiency loss in the 3-junction cell below 3%. The experimental results show that the formation of macroscopic cracks is prevented in thinned GaInAs/Ge 2-junction and GaInP/GaInAs/Ge 3-junction cells. These prototype crack-free multijunction cells demonstrate the concept and were used to rule out any possible component integration issue. The performance metrics are limited by the high threading dislocation density over 2·107cm−2 in the virtual substrates used, but an almost current matched, crack-free, thinned 3-junction solar cell is demonstrated, and the pathway towards solar cells with higher voltages identified.

Abstract: In order to fully utilize the energy of sunlight as much as possible, nanowire array (NWA) photocathodes have begun to be explored. The photoemission capability of the graded composition AlxGa1-xN NWA was studied to solve the problem of “secondary absorption” of escaping electrons by the adjacent nanowires of the NWA photocathode. The results show that the built-in electric field introduced by the graded composition can promote the drift and diffusion of the carriers inside the nanowire to the top surface. The single-component Al0.49Ga0.51N NWA is obtained the highest quantum efficiency at a resonance wavelength of 347 nm, which is approximately 42.81%. However, the graded composition AlxGa1-xN NWA cathode can obtain a quantum efficiency of 62.32% at 274 nm, which not only achieves an increase in quantum efficiency, but also causes a blue shift in the resonance wavelength. Furthermore, the graded composition AlxGa1-xN NWA cathode with a uniform thickness of H = 700 nm, P = 300 nm, and D = 150 nm has a resonance absorption of about 98% and a reflectance of only 1% at the resonance wavelength. The above studies all show that the graded composition AlxGa1-xN NWA cathode can be used as a future candidate core device for vacuum solar blind ultraviolet detectors.

Abstract: Anomalous photovoltaic effect and switchable photovoltaic output have propelled much recent research and development of ferroelectric photovoltaic (FE-PV) materials in solar cell, photodetection and optical-read nonvolatile memory fields. However, extremely small output photocurrent density in the order of nA/cm2 or μA/cm2 is the primary problem to limit applications of FE-PV materials. Herein, a large short-circuit current density is achieved in polycrystalline hexagonal YMnO3 (h-YMO) thin film prepared by sol–gel method, which reaches 3.92 mA/cm2 under 1 sun illumination (100 mW/cm2), much larger than that of other narrow-bandgap hexagonal rare-earth manganates or ferrites epitaxial thin film materials. A systematic nanoscale analysis suggests that the grain with ferroelectric polarization and grain boundary with high conductivity are the active structures that cause the photovoltaic effect. Especially, grain boundary induces a downward band bending due to potential difference at the grain/grain boundary interface, which forms a new build-in electric field to promote carrier separation. Moreover, grain boundary as the conduction path achieves effective transport of carriers. The work demonstrates the positive effect of grain boundaries in FE-PV materials, and opens up a promising route to the development of high-performance photovoltaic materials via the combined effect of ferroelectric polarization and grain boundary.

Abstract: Bandgap energy profiling is applied in a variety of materials for photovoltaic technologies, such as chalcogenides, III–V materials and perovskites. Bandgap profiling of the absorber layer is used to fight the fundamental loss mechanisms imposed by the bandgap energy of the absorber for the maximum voltage and current that a photovoltaic device can generate. The bandgap profile can be affected by a number of profiling strategies, such as the difference between the maximum and minimum bandgap energy, the position of the minimum bandgap energy, the width over which this minimum bandgap energy occurs and the total absorber width. These parameters have a complex effect on output characteristics of a photovoltaic device. Varying multiple parameters at once further increases the complexity, limiting the effectiveness of rigorous physical opto-electrical modelling. In this work we therefore present an expedient semi-empirical approach for the optimal bandgap profiling of stoichiometric absorbers. Using PECVD processed amorphous silicon germanium as a model, we present a unique set of semi-empirical relations that simulate the VOC and JSC of solar cells as a function of the bandgap energy profile. For this model, the influence of deposition conditions such as the relative germane flow rate, the deposition power and substrate temperature on the opto-electrical properties of a-SiGe:H films is first characterized. Opting for the relative germane flow rate to control the bandgap profiling, the experimental results of a large number of solar cells with profiled a-SiGe:H absorber are presented, varying: 1. the absorber thickness, 2. the peak germane flow rate, so minimum bandgap energy, and 3. the introduction of a plateau at the minimum bandgap energy. Using this experimental data and optical simulations, the expedience and effectiveness of the semi-empirical approach is demonstrated.

Abstract: Light trapping is an essential aspect in the design of photovoltaics based on thin absorbers. Incorporation of textured surface with different nanostructures is the main strategy for light trapping in all kinds of thin film photovoltaic (TFPV) cells. Highly textured back reflector (BR) with a composite structure of Al/Ag/ZnO proposed in this article could improve light-trapping performance of TFPVs, but studies on optical absorption revealed that at the Al/Ag interface existed parasitic surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). A plasmonic modulated BR (PMBR) with a dielectric layer introduced at the Al/Ag interface was deeply analyzed in this study. It could effectively ameliorate the parasitic absorption in the 300–500 nm wavelength range while maintaining the light-trapping effect. When it was applied in a surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) structure, results showed that a thin dielectric layer, as 20 nm undoped ZnO used here, could effectively prevent the local electromagnetic field evanescing at the Al/Ag interface. Using the optimized PMBR structure, active-area conversion efficiencies of 8.55%, 8.83% and 12.6% for a normal nc-Si:H single-junction cell, an ultra-thin a-Si:H single-junction cell and an a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H/nc-Si:H triple-junction cell were achieved, respectively. These ﬁndings could also be applied to other solar cells including silicon heterojunction, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), perovskite or tandem solar cells in which light management and modiﬁcations also need to be considered.

Abstract: Development of alternate counter electrode for the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) using simple and single method are the major focus of the research to resolve problems related to the platinum (Pt)-based counter electrode. In the present work, NiCo2S4 based counter electrode has been directly developed on the fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass substrate (FTO) using one step and simple hydrothermal method. The prepared NiCo2S4@FTO electrode was characterized by the range of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques as well as further assembled in the DSSC device in order to evaluate the electrode performance. The NiCo2S4 counter electrode exhibited the 6.53% photovoltaic performance in the assembled DSSC which is almost similar to the benchmark Pt based counter electrode (6.88%) under similar experimental conditions. The excellent performance of the elected NiCo2S4@FTO electrode could be due to the high electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of the I3− to I− and smaller size of the nanoparticle which provide high surface area and catalytic sites. We adapted a theoretical model based on electrical considerations to study the impact of physical parameter of DSSC cell on the – characteristic, performance and photovoltaic efficiency, using the experimental parameters. The model is reproducing perfectly the I–V curve and related DSSC characteristics.

Abstract: Photothermal conversion, thermal energy transportation and storage are crucial in solar energy utilization. Due to the complexity of synthesis technology, it remains a hot issue to achieve the integration of high photothermal conversion, thermal conductivity and energy storage for phase change materials (PCMs) in recent years. As a typical carbon aerogel, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) aerogel exhibits the porous structure and outstanding properties, which makes RGO aerogel an attractive material for compounding with phase change materials. In this work, RGO aerogel is prepared by the hydrothermal-freeze drying method, which can effectively solve the issue of PCMs leakage. Oxygen-deficient TiO2 (TiO2-x) can further enhance the optical performance and improve the thermal conductivity of composite materials to 1.22 W/(m·K). The optimum TiO2-x content is 80%, which can obtain 89.9% photothermal conversion efficiency for TiO2-x/RGO@PW. TiO2-x/RGO aerogel will bring a new paradigm for PCMs as the working medium in absorption solar energy.

Abstract: Constructing unfused-core non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) via intramolecular noncovalent interactions has been recognized as an effective route to obtain high-efficiency and low-cost concurrently for organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we report two new unfused-core NFAs, NCIC and NOCIC, with pyrazine and pyridazine as the cores, respectively. In contrast to traditional unfused-cores with fluorine or alkyloxy substituents, the nitrogen-containing six-membered heterocycle cores of NCIC and NOCIC have no substituents, which simplifies further synthetic steps of unfused-core NFAs. In the meantime, utilizing N⋯S and/or N⋯H interactions between the cores and adjacent cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) units, NCIC and NOCIC own good π-conjugated backbone planarity, consequently, show intense absorptions from 550 nm to 800 nm. Moreover, the electronegativity of aromatic N atoms in the cores pulls down the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the two NFAs, with -5.65 eV and -5.59 eV for NCIC and NOCIC, respectively, which is favorable for them to pair with the polymer donor with a deep HOMO level, PM6, to fabricate bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs. Finally, the PM6:NCIC based devices yield the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.32%, while those based on PM6:NOCIC blends provide a maximum PCE of 9.89%. This work demonstrates that the nitrogen-containing six-membered heterocycle is a kind of potential building block for high-performance and easy-synthesis unfused-core NFAs.

Abstract: Ultrathin Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) solar cells on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) back contacts combine advantages of ultrathin cells for reducing material consumption of rare indium and gallium and TCO-transparency benefited applications in tandems, bifacial configurations etc. However, their efficiencies are still limited and the back barrier potential is a primary reason from an electrical perspective. In this work, we explore the effects of Nadoping by post deposition treatment (PDT) on the performance of ultrathin CIGSe solar cells on ITO (Sn:In2O3)-coated Na-free glass substrates. Na doping enhances not only the open circuit-voltage (Voc) by increasing the doping level, but also the fill factor (FF) by switching the Schottky contact to an Ohmic contact at the CIGSe/ITO interface, which we propose is due to the increased recombination at the back interface. The optimum performance is achieved at a NaF dose of 2 mg with a top efficiency of 12.9%, which exhibits an enhancement by nearly 48% relative compared to the references without Na doping. To our best knowledge, this is the highest efficiency achieved for ultrathin cells (<500 nm absorber thickness) on TCO without additional antireflection or back reflecting layer. Therefore, the results show that sodium control offers a solid basis for the development of ultrathin CIGSe cells on TCO in above-mentioned promising applications.

Abstract: Silicon dioxide (SiO2) has played a critical role in the development of high-efficiency silicon (Si)-based photovoltaic devices. Recently, it has experienced a renaissance as an interlayer in many of the new contact passivating structures. Studies have extensively investigated the recombination process at the Si–SiO2 interface, however, only little is known about the impact of temperature on the surface recombination. In this study, we investigate the recombination at the Si–SiO2 interface by varying the temperature, excess carrier density, and dielectric fixed charge. An improved lifetime is observed with increasing temperature. A forming gas anneal is used to improve the passivation quality, however, at higher temperatures, the hydrogenated interface passivation degrades due to increased surface state density. The degradation is stronger for corona-charged SiO2, due to the instability of the corona charge within the dielectric. Using the extended Shockley-Read Hall recombination model, the Si–SiO2 interface defects’ parameters are extracted. Most importantly, we determine the value and the temperature-dependence of the capture cross-sections at this interface.

Abstract: With rapid growth in solar industry, the potential fate and management of solar modules has raised concerns due to the presence of few toxic metals. Present work addressed this issue by (i) estimating potential release values (solubility product, Ksp at pH 7) of various compounds used in different layers of emerging solar cells in neutral water and landfill leachate conditions, and (ii) further comparing their metal release values (termed as loss factors, LFs, hereafter) with that of first and second generation photovoltaics. Top five compounds with highest metal release probability (probability>0.5) were found to be: PbI2(highest LF)> CuI> Cd(OH)2> CuSCN> CdO (smallest LF). Also, the identified compounds with lowest risk were: PbSe <Sb2S3 <CdSe <Al2O3 <SnS (lowest probability: 10−10 to 10−16). With respect to solar cells, perovskite solar cells were ranked first in terms of hazard as it mostly contains compounds like PbI2, CuSCN, CuI, NiO, and Al2O3. Quantum dot solar cells were ranked second due to presence of category II compounds (i.e., ZnO). Further, the organic and dye-sensitized solar cells are of least concern as they do not contain compounds with high LF values. With respect to different layers of an emerging PV, electron- and hole-transport layers were found to be with highest risk for material release. With respect to third generation solar cells, metal LFs for first generation solar cells were less for lead, cadmium and copper. Following the conservative approach, the calculated conversion factors for metal loss values from neutral water (pH7) to landfill leachate (i.e., CFs = LFMSW leachate/LFpH7) for Pb (0.075), Cu (0.263), Ni (0.426), Zn (0.591) were used for estimating metal loss values from emerging solar cells in landfill leachate conditions. Among all generation solar PVs, mostly lead-containing compounds were found to be exceeding the LF cut-off values. Thus, perovskites solar cells with lead–based compounds might pose risk to groundwater or surface runoff due to lead.

Abstract: The understanding of soiling processes on photovoltaic modules is a necessary step for the development of cost-effective mitigation methods for the solar industry. This paper analyzes the soiling process for photovoltaic modules installed at the Atacama Desert. For this purpose, the dust deposited on photovoltaic modules and glasses (for one year) was characterized and the location's atmospheric parameters were monitored continuously. The dust samples were separated according to difference in solubility, obtaining three samples: soluble (recrystallized), insoluble (filtered), and original. Through x-ray diffraction measurements it was detected that the soluble part corresponds to gypsum and the other dust components are insoluble or low-solubility salts such as albite, anhydrite, calcite, quartz, and orthoclase. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy of the dust on photovoltaic glasses show the presence of gypsum with a monoclinic prismatic structure covered with smaller dust particles. These prismatic crystals are also observed after recrystallization of the soluble sample suggesting that gypsum, as a soluble hygroscopic material, has a key role in the cementation process. Atmospheric parameters of each season were characterized through wind velocity, temperature, and relative humidity. All these parameters show large daily oscillation, which trigger a cementation process in which gypsum crystallization, after being completely or partially solubilized, causes the encapsulation of insoluble material.

Abstract: The global needs for ecological friendliness and sustainable development in the photovoltaic (PV) market have led to an increased demand to fabricate solar cells in an environmentally sound manner using nontoxic elements. In response to these requirements, in chalcogenide solar cell technology, researchers are attempting to replace the conventional CdS buffer. A potential replacement buffer material is ZnOS due to its direct, large, and tunable bandgap. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) can be effectively used to deposit ZnOS on Cu(In1-x,Gax)Se2 (CIGSe) absorbers, as this process allows the highly controlled thickness and composition, conformal coverage, inline compatibility, and relatively easier maintenance. However, CIGSe solar cells with an ALD grown ZnOS buffer usually suffer from the deficit of open circuit voltage (Voc), which limits power conversion efficiency (PCE). To overcome the limitation, ZnOS buffer structure with ZnS nanolayer is engineered for heterojunction interface passivation (HIP) and the role of ZnS nanolayer is investigated. The insertion of the ZnS nanolayer between ZnOS and CIGSe exhibits passivation effects at the heterojunction interface, thereby to enhance the solar cell performance owing to the realization of a more refined bandgap structure. Wide bandgap ZnS passivation thus demonstrates considerable potentials for being applied in other material systems.

Abstract: Herein, the improved visible-light photocatalytic activity towards efficient hydrogen generation using modified P25 (TiO2) has been demonstrated. The P25 has been modified with pure and Phosphorus doped graphitic carbon nitride (CN and PCN) successfully and well-characterized by several analytical techniques. The effect of Phosphorus doping in CN favours to tune the opto-electronic and textural properties. The optimized composite of CN–P25 and PCN–P25 shows nearly twenty-two-fold (920 μmol/g) and forty-fold (2531 μmol/g) enhancement in hydrogen production as compared to CN and PCN respectively and nearly ten-fold and twenty-five-fold enhancement in hydrogen production as compared to P25. This overwhelming enhancement in hydrogen production can be attributed to the lowering of the conduction band by 0.13 eV and small conduction band offset of 0.35 eV estimated by cyclic voltammetry, which provokes the electron-hole recombination and better charge transfer at the PCN–P25 interface. These results unlock great avenues to develop the low cost and metal-free photocatalyst by simply modifying P25 with PCN in the field of energy and clean environment.

Abstract: Durability and reliability of solid particles to be used in concentrating solar power tower plants is crucial for the project viability. Solid particles materials to be implemented in concentrating solar power plants are thermal aged and thermal cycled in this study to evaluation of solid particles at high temperatures. A homemade device has been developed to perform accelerated-durability tests, that allows emulation of thermal cycling stress from days to years, and even evaluate the 11,000 cycles expected to be reached during 20 years' plant's lifetime in less than four months. A detailed description of the operation of this device is included in this paper. In addition, current solar absorptance, chemical composition, physical properties, thermal characteristics, and morphologic analysis of the samples before and after thermal treatments have been performed. The materials under the study are the most reliable solid particles reported in CSP field: silicon carbide (SiC) and CarboHSP® 30/60. Characterization results show that SiC is more affected on its durability by thermal cycling than by constant temperature aging treatment while CarboHSP® is affected by temperature aging rather than thermal cycling. SiC reacts with oxygen to form SiO2 on the surface, with a positive effect in its solar absorptance. Nevertheless, with thermal cycles, SiC particle surface becomes damaged and the reaction continues with more new exposed surface. Meanwhile, CarboHSP® reduces its solar absorptance with high temperature only due to changes in its surface chemical composition. However, thermal cycling shows no negative effect in CarboHSP® properties.

Abstract: In light of the ever-growing demand of modern electronics for wearable integrated optoelectronic devices, Fiber-shaped Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (FDSSCs) have gained increasing interest over the last years as suitable energy production systems for the development of the next generation of smart products. To fulfill the wearable concept, it is important to design long and flexible thin-film FDSSCs capable of adapting to curved surfaces such as the human body. In this study, for the first time, several key parameters towards the optimization of long and flexible FDSSCs based on inexpensive TiO2 as photoanode material and a fully organic thiazolo [5,4-d]thiazole-based sensitizer (TTZ5) were studied. First, the influence of photoanode thickness on photovoltaic performance was evaluated in 3.5 cm-long devices, for which an optimal thickness of 10 μm was identified, obtaining a maximum PCE of 1.57 ± 0.15%. Long (10 cm) complete FDSSCs were then fabricated, using thin layer photoanodes of about 5 μm which were instead found to be the optimal choice for such devices. The as-obtained FDSSCs based on TTZ5 possess dimensions appealing for future applications while also delivering a remarkable PCE of 1.23 ± 0.04%, thus paving the way for further optimization of thin-film flexible long FDSSCs based on organic sensitizers.

Abstract: The construction of high-performance materials with superior light-to-thermal conversion efficiency is of great importance for harvesting and utilization of solar energy. Hence, we report the creation of novel composite phase change materials (CPCMs) CPCMs by incorporating three kinds of organic phase change materials (PCMs), i.e. 1-Tetradecylamine (TDA), 1-hexadecanamine (HDA) and Octadecylamine (ODA), into hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNS) via a simple impregnation treatment for efficient light-to-thermal transition. Owing to their carbon in nature, the HCNS show better light absorption of higher than 90%. After incorporation of organic PCMs, their light absorption could still attain 62–70%, which can compete with the existing CPCMs. Beneficial from their abundant porosity and high specific surface areas, organic PCMs can be spontaneously diffused and immersed into the porous architecture of HCNS. In this way, the as-resulted CPCMs containing with TDA, HDA and ODA show high phase change enthalpy of 61.23J/g, 119.5J/g and 101.8J/g, respectively. The CPCMs also exhibit better thermal conductivity and excellent thermal stability, e.g., the enthalpy of HAD based CPCMs remains nearly unchanged even after 100 times of melting/freezing cycles. Under 1 sun irradiation, the light-to-thermal conversion efficiency of CPCMs containing with TDA, HDA and ODA were measured to be 73.04%, 74.46% and 71.74%, respectively, Thus showing great potential as a kind of promising photothermal conversion devices for solar or thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: Electrochromic devices (ECDs) based on iron metallopolymers (Fe-MEPE) and different oxide-based ion storage electrodes on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass as transparent, conductive substrates are investigated in detail. Titanium-manganese oxide (TMO) thin film electrodes deposited by reactive magnetron co-sputtering on FTO glass were compared to commercially available titanium-vanadium oxide (TiVOx) for use as optically-passive ion storage layers. The ECDs with Fe-MEPE combined with TiVOx (coloration efficiency η = 2 cm2 C−1 at 584 nm) and Ti-rich TMO (η = −4 cm2 C−1) are blue-purple in the dark state at 0 V and become highly transmissive when 1.5 V is applied with a visible light transmittance (τv) change from 28% to 69% and 21% to 57% in 3 s and 13 s, respectively. The ECDs show fast responses and high reversibility over more than 100 cycles. The combination of Fe-MEPE and Mn-rich TMO (η = −24 cm2 C−1) leads to a dark brown ECD, which can be brightened at 2.5 V (τv: 4% ↔17%, 9 s for decoloring).

Abstract: The AAA-ATPase NVL2 associates with an RNA helicase MTR4 and the nuclear RNA exosome in the course of ribosome biogenesis. In our proteomic screen, we had identified a ribosome biogenesis factor WDR74 as a MTR4-interacting partner, whose dissociation is stimulated by the ATP hydrolysis of NVL2. In this study, we report the identification of splicing factor 30 (SPF30), another MTR4-interacting protein with a similar regulatory mechanism. SPF30 is a pre-mRNA splicing factor harboring a Tudor domain in its central region, which regulates various cellular events by binding to dimethylarginine-modified proteins. The interaction between SPF30 and the exosome core is mediated by MTR4 and RRP6, a catalytic component of the nuclear exosome. The N- and C-terminal regions, but not the Tudor domain, of SPF30 are involved in the association with MTR4 and the exosome. The knockdown of SPF30 caused subtle delay in the 12S pre-rRNA processing to mature 5.8S rRNA, even though no obvious effect was observed on the ribosome subunit profile in the cells. Shotgun proteomic analysis to search for SPF30-interacting proteins indicated its role in ribosome biogenesis, pre-mRNA splicing, and box C/D snoRNA biogenesis. These results suggest that SPF30 collaborates with the MTR4-exosome machinery to play a functional role in multiple RNA metabolic pathways, some of which may be regulated by the ATP hydrolysis of NVL2.

Abstract: Microencapsulation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with a silica material to form a phase-change microcapsule system is universally acknowledged as a tough job due to its hydrophilic nature. This paper reported a feasible approach for the fabrication of core-shell structured PEG/silica phase-change microcapsules (PEG@SiO2-MEPCM) through reverse emulsion-templated in-situ polycondensation. The investigation of synthetic technique indicates that the proportion of surfactant and cosurfactant plays a key role in optimizing the morphology and microstructure of the resultant microcapsules, leading to optimal heat energy-storage performance. With the determination of an optimal mass ratio of surfactant to cosurfactant as 5/6, the synthesized PEG@SiO2-MEPCM exhibits a well-defined core-shell structure with regularly spherical morphology and uniform size distribution. It also achieves a high encapsulation ratio of over 80% with a satisfactory latent heat capacity of about 130 J/g thanks to the formation of a perfect microstructure and morphology. Moreover, the PEG@SiO2-MEPCM not only exhibits a good heat energy-storage capability together with high thermal stability and good shape/form stability, but also presents reliable and durable phase-change performance in practical use. This study is notable for its synthetic technique of the core-shell structured PEG/silica phase-change microcapsules with a reliable and durable heat energy-storage capability.

Abstract: Defects formed during the device processing acts as recombination centers and shows adverse effects on the photovoltaic performance of the organic solar cells (OSCs). In this manuscript, a study on the effect of defect states on the characteristics of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, consisted of unannealed or thermally annealed active layer (ActL) of PTB7:PC71BM blend, have been performed by using the illumination intensity-dependent current-voltage and frequency dependent impedance spectroscopy measurements. Our results indicate that the photovoltaic performance of devices based on annealed ActL is superior than the bench dried ActL due to thermal annealing induced improvement in the thin film morphology. The measured low-frequency capacitance-voltage (C–V) characteristics under varying illumination intensities show strong dependency on the photoexcitation however, the change in the C–V characteristics is found to be quite different for unannealed and annealed devices. The C–V characteristics are analyzed using the drift-diffusion model to extract the effective built-in voltage (Vbi) and the surface photovoltage as a function of illumination intensity. The capacitance-frequency characteristics under illumination reveal that the change in the capacitance is associated with the photo-induced carrier occupation in the intermixture donor-acceptor phases, which act as the defect states in such devices. Further, it is modeled to quantify the defect states and to demonstrate the importance of thermal annealing for improving the OSCs device performance.

Abstract: The performance of photovoltaic (PV) modules and their component materials under outdoor environmental stresses is the most important indicator of reliability, durability, and safety of PV modules throughout their service life. In this study, fielded modules with polyamide-based back-sheets (PA/PA/PA) and Tedlar PVF-based backsheets (PVF/PET/PVF) (TPT) from arid and subtropical climates in China were collected for comparison analysis. PA and PVF back-sheet samples were removed from the fielded modules. The weatherability of the airside layer of two different types of photovoltaic back-sheets has been compared and studied. Chemical composition, mechanical performance, surface morphology and optical discoloration of these back-sheet samples were evaluated to understand the degradation of back-sheet materials in fielded modules. By a series of measurements, significant differences were found in the durability between them.

Abstract: In the framework of the H2020 European project POLYPHEM, whose main objective is to improve the flexibility and performance of small-scale solar power plants, studies have been conducted on various nickel-based alloys for the design of the solar receiver. Inconel 600 alloy is used as a reference material in the advanced manufacturing of high temperature solar receivers but other oxidation resistant alloys have been selected such as Inconel 617, Haynes 230, Haynes HR120 and Hastelloy X and the best candidate will be used for making the prototype. Thus, two essential quantities, namely the solar absorptivity α – the higher the better – and the total hemispherical emissivity ε – the lower the better – were measured in high vacuum and under atmospheric air up to 1400 K in the MEDIASE reactor installed at the focus of the 1000 kW solar furnace. The objective is to reach the best solar absorptivity and the α/ε ratio the highest as possible. The emissivity measurement was made by a direct method requiring the measurement of the true temperature of the material using a bi-chromatic pyro-reflectometer and that of its radiance by spectro-radiometry. Total hemispherical emissivity data are presented at the same time as microstructural (SEM, XRD) and topographic (3D profilometry) characterizations allowing the interpretation of the emissivity evolution with temperature and the growth of the oxide layer. Finally, the alloy Haynes 230 was chosen to build the solar receiver.

Abstract: Polymer-based radiative cooling emitters (RCE) can drop the surface temperature lower than that of ambient without any external energy input, while the optical performance and application is limited. In this work, with the aim of enhancing the selective emission within atmospheric window and anti-contamination of the polymer coating in RCE, a super-hydrophobic bilayer RCE has been designed and prepared. Firstly, series of selected particles were embedded into a thin Polymethylpentene (TPX) composite polymer film. Then, the film was coated onto a high-reflective aluminum sheet. Next, the surface of the RCE was modified by particles (mica and TiO2) deposition and hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (HDTMS). As a result, the absorption peak was broadened to the whole atmospheric window region, and the anti-contamination performance was achieved with enhanced water contact angle of 159°. Moreover, the contact angle showed negligible change after continuous contaminated and cleaned processes. Besides, the RCE can also retain the selective emission and super-hydrophobic performance after exposed to UV-irradiation. During outdoor measurement, the RCE can drop the temperature below the ambient with a temperature difference of ~6 °C during the whole day. Super-hydrophobicity also can gain the RCE better cooling performance under high relative humidity, with a temperature of 2–3 °C larger than the hydrophilic RCE. The successful combination of cooling and anti-contamination functions endows our designed the polymer-based RCE the potential of practical application to serve as a multifunctional and long life passive RCE.
