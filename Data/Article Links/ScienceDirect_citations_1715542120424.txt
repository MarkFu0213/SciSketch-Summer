Abstract: Among various light-absorbing materials, Copper Zinc Tin Sulphide (CZTS), Selenide (CZTSe) and their alloy structures (CZTSxSe1-x) are viewed as important candidates in thin film solar cell applications. Next development in this field could be a band edge engineering using varied composition layer-structure. Such configuration is expected to absorbed broad spectrum of light and will also provide additional gradient for the efficient charge separation. For such development, however the prior knowledge of band edge parameters as a function of composition is needed. Herein, we describe the bench top electrochemical approach to estimate conduction and valence band edge positions for CZTSxSe1−x as a function of ‘x’. CZTSxSe1−x alloy nanocrystals with varied compositions have been prepared by solvothermal method. These were carefully characterized by UV–vis, FTIR-ATR, XRD, Raman, TEM, SEM, and EDAX analysis to confirm the formation of alloys with desired composition. Cyclic voltammetry analysis carried out on them gave distinct cathodic and anodic peaks, which are co-related to the electron transfer mediated through conduction and valence band edges, respectively. The band edge parameters obtained by cyclic voltammetry matched well with the one reported previously by photoelectron spectroscopy method.

Abstract: In this study, Mo-doped ZnO (MZO) films were investigated using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory and magnetron sputtering technology. The theoretical results predicted that after Mo was incorporated into ZnO, the MZO film would present n-type metallic properties and the optical band gap would widen, which predicts that MZO films possess favorable electrical and optical properties. An MZO film with high conductivity and a wide spectral range was fabricated at various substrate temperatures (TS) using pulsed direct-current magnetron sputtering. From 400 to 1200nm, a lower resistivity of 7.68×10−4Ωcm and a higher average transmittance (exceeding 80%) were observed when the MZO film was deposited at the optimal TS of 280°C. Thin-film solar cells consisting of hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon germanium fabricated on textured MZO films demonstrated a strong enhancement of 7.24% in the conversion efficiency because of their improved short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) compared with a commercial Al-doped ZnO film applied to a reference solar cell.

Abstract: Compared with the popular conjugated polyelectrolytes as interfacial materials in polymer solar cells (PSCs), small molecule conjugated electrolytes (SMCEs) interlayers remains limited and the relationship between structures of small molecule electrolytes and device performance is still unclear. Herein, a series of alcohol-soluble small molecule conjugated electrolytes, combined with different conjugated skeletons and identical ammonium salt polar side chains, namely, 2T-(FN-Br)2, 3T-(FN-Br)2 and 4T-(FN-Br)2 were designed and synthesized as interfacial materials for the inverted polymer solar cells (I-PSCs), to explore the relevance between the π-conjugated skeleton and the device performance. As the conjugated bridge length and terminal group increased from 2T-(FN-Br)2, 3T-(FN-Br)2 to 4T-(FN-Br)2, the photovoltaic performances were gradually improved. The improved device performance caused by the enlarged π-conjugated skeleton mainly resulted from the optimized interfacial contact, effective modulation on the morphology of the active layer and the improvement of charge mobility. Encouragingly, devices with 4T-(FN-Br)2 as interfacial material achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 8.40%, based on thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7): [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as light-harvesting layer. This work provided a new avenue to exploit novel promising interfacial modification materials by simply and slightly modulating the π-conjugated skeleton without complex molecular design.

Abstract: Low-dose photodynamic therapy (L-PDT) has been used to transiently increase the permeability of tumor vessels to improve the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to lung tumors. However, the effects of L-PDT in a long-term on delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs are unknown. In this study, we studied this question as well as the underlying mechanisms. We found that the effects of L-PDT on tumor vessel permeability appeared to be prolonged. Moreover, L-PDT significantly increased the number of tumor associated macrophages, and appeared to induce macrophage polarization to a M1 phenotype. Further analyses showed that L-PDT upregulated stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in tumor to recruit macrophages through a SDF-1/Chemokine (C-X-C Motif) Receptor 4 (CXCR4) axis, which accounted for the prolonged effects of L-PDT on vessel permeability. Application of a specific CXCR4 inhibitor significantly suppressed the L-PDT-induced macrophage recruitment, resulting in abolishment of the prolonged effects of L-PDT on vessel permeability. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of Liporubicin™ on the growth of the implanted tumor in L-PDT-treated mice were significantly attenuated by CXCR4 inhibition. Thus, our data demonstrate a previously unappreciated long-lasting effect of L-PDT on vessel permeability, and suggest that this long-lasting effects of L-PDT treatment on vessel permeability may result from modulation of macrophage recruitment and polarization. Hence, L-PDT may be a promising method to assist chemotherapeutic approaches.

Intracellular metabolic changes of Clostridium acetobutylicum and promotion to butanol tolerance during biobutanol fermentation,

Abstract: During the fermentation process, Clostridium acetobutylicum cells are often inhibited by the accumulated butanol. However, the mechanism underlying response of C. acetobutylicum to butanol stress remains poorly understood. This study was performed to clarify such mechanism through investigating the butanol stress-associated intracellular biochemical changes at acidogenesis phase (i.e., middle exponential phase) and solventogenesis phase (i.e., early stationary phase) by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics strategy. With the aid of partial least-squares-discriminant analysis, a pairwise discrimination between control group and butanol-treated groups was revealed, and 27 metabolites with variable importance in the projection value greater than 1 were identified. Under butanol stress, the glycolysis might be inhibited while TCA cycle might be promoted. Moreover, changes of lipids and fatty acids compositions, amino acid metabolism and osmoregulator concentrations might be the key factors involved in C. acetobutylicum metabolic response to butanol stress. It was suggested that C. acetobutylicum cells might change the levels of long acyl chain saturated fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids to maintain the integrity of cell membrane through adjusting membrane fluidity under butanol stress. The increased level of glycerol was considered to be correlated with osmoregulation and regulating redox balance. In addition, increased levels of some amino acids (i.e., threonine, glycine, alanine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, aspartate and glutamate) might also confer butanol tolerance to C. acetobutylicum. These results highlighted our knowledge about the response or adaptation of C. acetobutylicum to butanol stress, and would contribute to the construction of feasible butanologenic strains with higher butanol tolerance.

Abstract: Study of the device characteristics of a CdTe solar cell under weak light irradiance (Eirra) is important both for the understanding of the fundamental device physics and for the commercial application, where Eirra with intensity much less than one sun is often encountered for an outdoor solar cell module. In this study, CdTe solar cell performance under Eirra as low as 0.015sun was studied. Both the fill factor (FF) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) were found to be critically affected by the shunt resistance at low Eirra. The current shunting depends critically on the physical location of the shunting paths in the CdTe absorber layer. Space-charge limited current (SCLC) was identified to be an important contribution to the shunting current in thin film CdTe solar cell. At an Eirra as low as 0.015 Sun, CdTe solar cell with a high shunt resistance maintained an efficiency of ~70 to 80% of the value tested at the standard AM1.5 Eirra. The experimental results showed that polycrystalline CdTe thin film solar cell is a good photovoltaic device for electric power generation at low Eirra. This study provides constructive guidelines for the future design and fabrication of CdTe solar cells.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) cells induce current–voltage (I–V) characteristics dependent on the PV cell technology, the thin film structure and their eventual flaws during the elaboration process. The operation conditions also have a relevant impact on electrical curves characterizing these devices. The electrical parameters can be extracted from a PV panel standard datasheet using the commonly encountered single and double diode equivalent models representing the PV cell. This was done, in the present paper, at the most fundamental expression of these two models using evolutionary algorithms implemented in MATLAB (i.e. metaheuristic optimization methods). Four different I–V characteristics were available for the investigated commercial PV panel. They were fitted separately using the diode models and then taken as a whole to obtain parameters as physically meaningful as possible for the whole temperature range. The metaheuristic methods performed well for this problem, especially the cuckoo search algorithm. However, even with a good fitting of the fundamental behavior of the I–V characteristics, the presented approach may yield optimized solutions not as physically correct as it was expected. Thus, care must be taken for correctly interpreting the optimization results.

Abstract: Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin film solar cells are fabricated based on sputtering and post sulfurization process on stainless steel substrates. NaF layers with different thickness are used as external sodium source to address the lack of Na issue in Na-free steel substrates and 10nm of NaF layer is proved to be the optimal thickness. Sodium incorporation into CZTS induces the metal element redistribution, facilitates CZTS film recrystallization and promotes the phase evolution. Appropriate amount of sodium is evidenced to yield an enhancement in power conversion efficiency from 3.07% to 4.10% whilst further increase in sodium tends to deteriorate the device efficiency. Device performance deterioration is correlated to the rather small grain size accompanied with a large amount of grain boundaries and unfavorable SnS2 secondary phase for CZTS samples without sodium, while pinholes and lower carrier density in absorber for CZTS samples with over amount of sodium.

Abstract: Spermidine acetyltransferase (SAT) from Escherichia coli, which catalyses the transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to spermidine, is a key enzyme in controlling polyamine levels in prokaryotic cells. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of SAT in complex with spermidine (SPD) and CoA at 2.5Å resolution. SAT is a dodecamer organized as a hexamer of dimers. The secondary structural element and folding topology of the SAT dimer resemble those of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT), suggesting an evolutionary link between SAT and SSAT. However, the polyamine specificity of SAT is distinct from that of SSAT and is promiscuous. The SPD molecule is also located at the inter-dimer interface. The distance between SPD and CoA molecules is 13Å. A deep, highly acidic, water-filled cavity encompasses the SPD and CoA binding sites. Structure-based mutagenesis and in-vitro assays identified SPD-bound residues, and the acidic residues lining the walls of the cavity are mostly essential for enzymatic activities. Based on mutagenesis and structural data, we propose an acetylation mechanism underlying promiscuous polyamine recognition for SAT.

Abstract: We assess the environmental impact of a dynamic, adaptive, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. Such systems combine the benefits of adaptive shading with facade integrated solar tracking, thus reducing the building energy demand, and simultaneously generating electricity on-site. The inventory for the life cycle assessment (LCA) was acquired using production data, and Energy Plus simulations to calculate the building energy demand. The impact assessment was conducted according to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards using the Eco-invent database and openLCA as an analysis tool. The embodied environmental impact of the dynamic BIPV solution is higher than a static alternative due to the added control system, electronics, actuators, and additional supporting structure, resulting in higher life cycle impacts. However when accounting for the systems multi-functionality aspect, i.e. savings through adaptive shading to the building׳s heating, cooling and lighting loads, the embodied environmental impact can be offset, making the ASF an interesting alternative for BIPV. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate modifications to the actuator type, control system, and location and find that none of the investigated parameters overturn the key findings. The analysis ultimately enables us to provide design recommendations for future dynamic BIPV installations.

Abstract: All-oxide solar cells are presently attracting extensive research interest due to their excellent stability, low-cost and non-toxicity. However, the band gap of metal oxides is lack of effective optimization and results in poor photovoltaic performance, thus hindering their practical applications. In this work, Co3O4 was investigated for application as a photo-absorber in all-oxide solar cells, and its band gap was optimized by introducing Li dopant into the spinel structure. LixCo3−xO4 nanoparticles, prepared via the hydrothermal method, were homogenously coated onto TiO2 mesoporous films, which were then used to fabricate planar heterojunction TiO2/LixCo3−xO4 solar cells (SCs). The effects of Li-doping on the heterojunction solar cell performance were further investigated. The findings revealed that the incorporation of Li ions into Co3O4 led to a significant enhancement in short-circuit current density (Jsc). Remarkably, a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.70V was also achieved. Besides, reasons for the enhanced cell performance are the narrower band gap, reduced photogenerated carrier recombination and the more favorable energy band structure as compared with SCs assembled from pure Co3O4.

Abstract: Transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells is a promising strategy for treating sepsis. Natural killer cells are important in the development of sepsis, and their functions can be inhibited by mesenchymal stromal cells, we asked whether mesenchymal stromal cells exert their therapeutic effects through inhibiting the functions of natural killer cells in a septic mouse model generated with cecal ligation puncture method. Using co-cultures of cells, small interfering RNA, enzyme-linked immnuosorbent assays, fluorescence assays, western blotting, and pathological examination, we investigated the levels of inflammatory cytokines, proliferation of natural killer cells, inflammatory infiltration of important organs in mice, and activity of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway and found that mesenchymal stromal cells inhibited the function and proliferation of septic natural killer cells, increased interleukin-10 levels and increased the expression of components, such as Janus kinase 1, Janus kinase 2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that mesenchymal stromal cells have their therapeutic effect in the septic mouse model through inhibiting the function and proliferation of septic natural killer cells. This biological process may involve interleukin-10 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 as well as other pathway components in the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway. Transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells is an effective strategy to treat sepsis.

Abstract: In this study, the reactive ion etching in combination with alkaline etching was employed to texture the surface of a 156×156mm2 multi-crystalline silicon wafers to reduce their solar reflectivity and improve conversion efficiency. Reactive gases comprising chlorine (Cl2), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and oxygen (O2), were activated in the radio-frequency (rf) plasma to fabricate pyramids in an reactive ion etching (RIE) system. The multi-crystalline Si substrates were etched in various compositions of gases to form the nanostructures of various shapes. Besides the nanoscale features, the high density of nanostructures formed on the multi-crystalline Si surface was also required to significantly reduce the reflectivity. A low reflectivity surface was successfully fabricated with the average reflectivity significantly reduced down to <2% for the wavelength range of 300–850nm. The short wavelength spectral response (blue response) improvement is observed in RIE textured solar cells compared to the standard textured cells. The RIE textured surfaces in combination with optimized emitter resistance result in a remarkable enhancement of short circuit current density. Compared with the acidic textured solar cells, the absolute conversion efficiency of the alkaline+RIE textured cells was improved by 0.76% in average.

Abstract: We demonstrate effective passivation of a variety of crystalline silicon (c-Si) surfaces by a thin layer of thermal atomic layer deposited (ALD) titanium oxide (TiO2). Surface recombination velocities of 0.8cm/s, 2.5cm/s and 9.8cm/s have been obtained on n-type 10cm, 1Ωcm and p-type 1Ωcm undiffused wafers, respectively. Recombination current densities of 19 fA/cm2 and 780 fA/cm2 have been measured on 120Ω/□ boron diffused p+ and 100Ω/□ phosphorus diffused n+ regions. In addition to providing a superior passivation on p+ over n+ (c-Si) surfaces, the ALD TiO2 layers produces a strong injection-dependent effective lifetime on the n-type substrates, , both of which are consistent with the possible presence of negative charge in the passivating layer. The recombination at the interface between TiO2 and planar <100>, planar <111> and alkaline textured (c-Si) surfaces with upright pyramids is compared. We find that (i) a planar <111> surface exhibits a 1.39 times higher recombination than a planar <100> surface, and (ii) after area correction, the ratio of recombination on the textured and planar <111> surfaces is 1.37. A thin film of TiO2 deposited by ALD has been applied to the front surface of a rear locally diffused p+nn+ front junction solar cell, performing the dual role of surface passivation and single-layer antireflection coating on the textured p+ diffusion. The best solar cell achieved Voc=655mV, FF=79.9% and efficiency=20.45%. The results presented in this work demonstrate that TiO2 re-emerging as a suitable optical and passivating material to produce high performance solar cells.

Abstract: A method of reducing optical losses in the transparent conductive oxides (TCO) used in silicon heterojunction solar cells without compromising with series resistance is described. In the method the thickness of a TCO is reduced two-three times and a hydrogenated dielectric is deposited on top to form a double layer antireflection coating. The conductivity of a thin TCO is increased due to the effect of hydrogen treatment supplied from the capping dielectric during the post deposition annealing. The optimized cells with ITO/SiOx:H stacks achieved more than 41mA/cm2 generation current on 120-micron-thick wafers while having approximately 100Ω/square sheet resistance. The paper also considers integration of ITO/SiOx:H stacks with Cu plating and using ITO/SiNx/SiOx triple layer antireflection coatings.

Abstract: Vimentin expression correlates well with migratory and invasive potential of the carcinoma cells. The molecular mechanism by which vimentin regulates cell motility is not yet clear. Here, we addressed this issue by depleting vimentin in oral squamous cell carcinoma derived cell line. Vimentin knockdown cells showed enhanced adhesion and spreading to laminin-5. However, we found that they were less invasive as compared to the vector control cells. In addition, signaling associated with adhesion behavior of the cell was increased in vimentin knockdown clones. These findings suggest that the normal function of β4 integrin as mechanical adhesive device is enhanced upon vimentin downregulation. As a proof of principle, the compromised invasive potential of vimentin depleted cells could be rescued upon blocking with β4 integrin adhesion-blocking (ASC-8) antibody or downregulation of β4 integrin in vimentin knockdown background. Interestingly, plectin which associates with α6β4 integrin in the hemidesmosomes, was also found to be upregulated in vimentin knockdown clones. Furthermore, experiments on lysosome and proteasome inhibition revealed that perhaps vimentin regulates the turnover of β4 integrin and plectin. Moreover, an inverse association was observed between vimentin expression and β4 integrin in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Collectively, our results show a novel role of vimentin in modulating cell motility by destabilizing β4 integrin-mediated adhesive interactions. Further, vimentin-β4 integrin together may prove to be useful markers for prognostication of human oral cancer.

Starting from the typical cermet-based thin film stratification constituting high-performance solar coating, the optical properties of the metallic layer deposited as “back reflector” strongly determines the thermal loss amount, where solar coating emissivity should have to be as low as possible. Thanks to its very high reflectance in the infrared region, silver is more promising respect to transition metals such as molybdenum and tungsten. An adaptive tungsten layer deposited on stainless steel substrate has been employed with the aim of promoting improvements both on adhesion and on thermal stability of the Ag infrared reflector. Optimization procedure has been in detail described to design and to realize effective cermet-based solar coatings. Six different solar coatings with Ag as back reflector have been optically designed by means of a semi-empirical procedure where a layer-on-layer ellipsometric characterization was utilized. These optimized coatings were fabricated at increasing solar absorptance values coupled with emissivity values, evaluated at 580°C, lower than 14%. Improved performances have been obtained respect to similar optimized solar coatings with W as back reflector and the highest photo-thermal conversion efficiency has been reached (>92% at 400°C and >85% at 550°C) among the solar coatings at the present state of the art. Excellent thermal and optical stability has been proved by means of annealing cycles at 580°C under vacuum for a total duration of 85 days.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 3rd cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Most cases arise in a background of chronic inflammation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, severe fibrosis and stem/progenitor cell amplification. Although HCCs are soft cellular tumors, they may contain fibrous nests within the tumor mass. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore cancer cell phenotypes in fibrous nests. Combined anatomic pathology, tissue microarray and real-time PCR analyses revealed that HCCs (n=82) containing fibrous nests were poorly differentiated, expressed Wnt pathway components and target genes, as well as markers of stem/progenitor cells, such as CD44, LGR5 and SOX9. Consistently, in severe liver fibroses (n=66) and in HCCs containing fibrous nests, weighted correlation analysis revealed a gene network including the myofibroblast marker ACTA2, the basement membrane components COL4A1 and LAMC1, the Wnt pathway members FZD1; FZD7; WNT2; LEF1; DKK1 and the Secreted Frizzled Related Proteins (SFRPs) 1; 2 and 5. Moreover, unbiased random survival forest analysis of a transcriptomic dataset of 247 HCC patients revealed high DKK1, COL4A1, SFRP1 and LAMC1 to be associated with advanced tumor staging as well as with bad overall and disease-free survival. In vitro, these genes were upregulated in liver cancer stem/progenitor cells upon Wnt-induced mesenchymal commitment and myofibroblast differentiation. In conclusion, fibrous nests express Wnt target genes, as well as markers of cancer stem cells and mesenchymal commitment. Fibrous nests embody the specific microenvironment of the cancer stem cell niche and can be detected by routine anatomic pathology analyses.

Abstract: Hot carrier generation in silicon (Si) quantum dots (QDs) is studied with power dependent continuous wave photoluminescence (CWPL) spectroscopy. By taking sub-band gap absorption into account, a modified Maxwell-Boltzmann-form equation was employed to achieve accurate theoretical fitting to the CWPL spectra of the Si QDs. As a fitting parameter, the excited carrier temperature was calculated. A steady-state carrier population was revealed with a temperature 500K above room temperature under illumination equivalent to one standard sun (100mW/cm2). In addition, since the carrier temperature increased with the power of illumination, a state filling effect is proposed as a reasonable cause for the elevated carrier temperature by comparative study of the CWPL spectra of Si QDs with three different sizes. These Si QDs show great potential for one of the steps towards a practical hot carrier solar cell (HCSC) device as high carrier temperatures can be achieved by state filling under mild illumination.

Abstract: The performance of crystalline silicon photovoltaic module is mainly determined by the efficiency of silicon cells, but the performances of other components, such as the encapsulant, the front glass and the backsheet, also have an impact. Among these, the optical properties of the backsheet are critical in determining the performance of the photovoltaic module as higher reflectance of the inner side of the backsheet helps redirect more reflected light back to the photovoltaic cell. In addition to the optical properties of the backsheet, the durability of the backsheet should be taken into account due to its role in ensuring a module lifetime of 20–25 years. The backsheet protects the module and its components from external stresses and also acts as an electric insulator. In this study, we focused on the performance and degradation of different types of backsheets and how these impact the performance of the module. We investigate how the initial optical performance of the backsheet impacts the performance of the module. After degradation at 85°C and 85% relative humidity over 4000h, reflectance and module performance were correlated and compared with its initial performance.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, increasing evidence suggests that intracellular β-amyloid protein (Aβ) alone plays a pivotal role in the progression of AD. Therefore, understanding the signaling pathway and proteins that control Aβ internalization may provide new insight for regulating Aβ levels. In the present study, the regulation of Aβ internalization by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) through low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) was analyzed in vivo. The data derived from this investigation revealed that Aβ1-42 were internalized by neurons and astrocytes in mouse brain, and were largely deposited in mitochondria and lysosomes, with some also being found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Aβ1-42-LRP1 complex was formed during Aβ1-42 internalization, and the p38 MAPK signaling pathway was activated by Aβ1-42 via LRP1. Aβ1-42 and LRP1 were co- localized in the cells of parietal cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, the level of LRP1-mRNA and LRP1 protein involved in Aβ1-42 internalization in mouse brain. The results of this investigation demonstrated that Aβ1-42 induced an LRP1-dependent pathway that related to the activation of p38 MAPK resulting in internalization of Aβ1-42. These results provide evidence supporting a key role for the p38 MAPK signaling pathway which is involved in the regulation of Aβ1-42 internalization in the parietal cortex and hippocampus of mouse through LRP1 in vivo.

Abstract: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important process associated with the metastasis of breast cancer cells. Members of the Janus kinases (JAKs) and Src family kinases (SFKs) are implicated in the regulation of an invasive phenotype in various cancer cell types. Using the pharmacological inhibitors JAK Inhibitor I (a pan-JAK inhibitor) and PP2 we investigated the role of the JAKs and SFKs, respectively, in the regulation of EMT markers in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line model of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced EMT. We identified selective inhibition of EGF induction of the mesenchymal marker vimentin by PP2 and JAK Inhibitor I. The effect of JAK Inhibitor I on vimentin protein induction occurred at a concentration lower than that required to significantly inhibit EGF-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-phosphorylation, suggesting involvement of a STAT3-independent mechanism of EGF-induced vimentin regulation by JAKs. Despite our identification of a role for the JAK family in EGF-induced vimentin protein expression, siRNA-mediated silencing of each member of the JAK family was unable to phenocopy pharmacological inhibition, indicating potential redundancy among the JAK family members in this pathway. While SFKs and JAKs do not represent global regulators of the EMT phenotype, our findings have identified a role for members of these signaling pathways in the regulation of EGF-induced vimentin expression in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line.

Abstract: Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones widely used to control many inflammatory conditions. These effects are primarily attributed to glucocorticoid receptor transrepressional activities but with concomitant receptor transactivation associated with considerable side effects. Accordingly, there is an immediate need for selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists able to dissociate transactivation from transrepression. Triterpenoids have structural similarities with glucocorticoids and exhibit anti-inflammatory and apoptotic activities via mechanisms that are not well-defined. In this study, we examined whether echinocystic acid and its 3-O-glucoside derivative act, at least in part, through the regulation of glucocorticoid receptor and whether they can constitute selective receptor activators. We showed that echinocystic acid and its glucoside induced glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation by 75% and 55%. They suppressed the nuclear factor-kappa beta transcriptional activity by 20% and 70%, respectively, whereas they have no glucocorticoid receptor transactivation capability and stimulatory effect on the expression of the phosphoenolopyruvate carboxykinase target gene in HeLa cells. Interestingly, their suppressive effect is diminished in glucocorticoid receptor low level COS-7 cells, verifying the receptor involvement in this process. Induced fit docking calculations predicted favorable binding in the ligand binding domain and structural characteristics which can be considered consistent with the experimental observations. Further, glucocorticoids exert apoptotic activities; we have demonstrated here that the echinocystic acids in combination with the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, induce apoptosis. Taken together, our results indicate that echinocystic acids are potent glucocorticoid receptor regulators with selective transrepressional activities (dissociated from transactivation), highlighting the potential of echinocystic acid derivatives as more promising treatments for inflammatory conditions.

Abstract: Emerging evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNA, or miR) play vital roles in regulating osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that govern BMSCs osteogenic differentiation is of paramount importance for improving the treatment of bone-related diseases. In our current study, we investigated the role of miR-23a in BMSCs osteogenesis. Our results revealed that miR-23a was significantly downregulated during osteogenic differentiation. Overexpression of miR-23a inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in vitro, whereas downregulation of miR-23a enhanced the process. Target prediction analysis and dual luciferase reporter assays confirmed that low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) was a direct target of miR-23a. Furthermore, knockdown of LRP5 inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs, similar to the effect observed in upregulation miR-23a. Our data indicate that miR-23a plays an inhibitory role in osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs, which may act by targeting LRP5.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence has shown that podocyte apoptosis is of vital importance for the development of glomerulosclerosis and progressive loss of renal function. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to podocyte apoptosis are still elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of estrogen-related receptor (ERR) γ in podocyte apoptosis, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Treatment of PAN caused a dose- and time-dependent podocyte apoptosis in line with a significant downregulation of ERRγ. Interestingly, the occurrence of ERRγ downregulation appeared earlier than the onset of cell apoptosis, suggesting a potential that ERRγ reduction triggered apoptotic response in podocyte. To test this hypothesis, ERRγ siRNA was administered to the podocytes. Strikingly, ERRγ silencing resulted in a significant cell apoptosis accompanied with increased injury markers of B7-1 and cathepsin L and decreased podocyte protein nephrin. In contrast, overexpression of ERRγ remarkably attenuated PAN-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, ERRγ overexpression stimulated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway evidenced by increased expression of PI3K subunits p85α and p110α and phosphorylated Akt. Importantly, a specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002 entirely reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of ERRγ following PAN treatment. Finally, we observed a striking downregulation of ERRγ in PAN-treated rat kidneys, suggesting that our cell model replicated the in vivo condition. Taken together, these data highly suggested that ERRγ played a novel role in modulating podocyte apoptosis by targeting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 protects cardiomyocytes against hypoxia, but the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. In the present study, we used gain- and loss-of-function approaches to explore the effects of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II on energy production in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. Hypoxia repressed ATP production in cultured cardiomyocytes, whereas overexpression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 significantly improved ATP production. Conversely, knockdown of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 facilitated the hypoxia-induced decrease in ATP synthesis. Further investigation revealed that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 induced the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, a component of cytochrome c oxidase that is important in mitochondrial respiratory chain function. Moreover, lentiviral-mediated overexpression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II antagonized the decrease in ATP synthesis caused by knockdown of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1, whereas knockdown of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II attenuated the increase in ATP synthesis caused by overexpression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1. In addition, inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II by a specific inhibitor sodium azide suppressed the ATP sy nthesis induced by overexpressed tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1. Hence, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 protects cardiomyocytes from hypoxia at least partly via potentiation of energy generation, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II is one of the downstream effectors that mediates the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1-mediated energy generation program.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ∼22 nucleotide regulatory RNAs that regulate the stability and translation of cognate mRNAs. MiRNAs participate in the regulation of adipogenesis, and identification of the full repertoire of miRNAs expressed in adipose tisse is likely to improve our understanding of adipose tissue growth and development significantly. In the present study, miR-215-5p was found to inhibit adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, fibronectin type III domain containing 3B (FNDC3B) and catenin, beta interacting protein 1 (CTNNBIP1) were found to be direct targets of miR-215-5p. Further studies in mouse 3T3-L1 cell-line suggests that miR-215-5p is a negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation through post-transcriptional regulation of FNDC3B and CTNNBIP1 during early adipogenesis.

Abstract: Tb3+–Yb3+ co-doped SiNx down-conversion layers compatible with silicon Photovoltaic Technology were prepared by reactive magnetron co-sputtering. Efficient sensitization of Tb3+ ions through a SiNx host matrix and cooperative energy transfer between Tb3+ and Yb3+ ions were evidenced as driving mechanisms of the down-conversion process. In this paper, the film composition and microstructure are investigated alongside their optical properties, with the aim of maximizing the rare earth ions incorporation and emission efficiency. An optimized layer achieving the highest Yb3+ emission intensity was obtained by reactive magnetron co-sputtering in a nitride rich atmosphere for 1.2W/cm2 and 0.15W/cm2 power density applied on the Tb and Yb targets, respectively. It was determined that depositing at 200°C and annealing at 850°C lead to comparable Yb3+ emission intensity than depositing at 500°C and annealing at 600°C, which is promising for applications toward silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Accelerated thermal cycle test of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of molecular weight 6000, an organic phase change material (O-PCM), has been carried out for 1500 melt/freeze cycles. The latent heat of fusion and melting temperature is measured using differential scanning calorimeter between 0th and 1500th melt–freeze cycles to study the changes in its thermal properties. Also, the changes in the compositional/functional groups of the material during the cycle test are also measured using FT-IR spectroscopy technique. The melting temperature is found to be stable in the quoted range of 55–60°C with a maximum deviation of 6.5% when compared to that of at 0th cycle. However, a gradual drop in the latent heat of fusion with the increasing number of thermal cycles is measured. The FT-IR spectra do not show any noticeable changes in the peaks which confirm its compositional stability even after the higher number of thermal cycles. Thermal and chemical reliability tests of PEG 6000 along with the techno-economic analysis have shown that this PCM has a significant potential to be used as a thermal energy storage system.

Abstract: Thin films of n-type copper doped tin sulfide (SnS:Cu) are deposited employing Chemical Spray Pyrolysis (CSP) technique and effect of post deposition annealing of the films in vacuum as well as in air is evaluated. Structural characterization through X-ray diffraction proved that annealing aided formation of polycrystalline films with orthorhombic structure and preferential orientation of grains along (111) plane, a direction greatly advantageous for PV applications. Raman spectrum of the films had two peaks (at 96cm−1 and 224cm−1) belonging only to that of SnS. The band gap of as-prepared films is around ~1.5eV which changed slightly on annealing. Surface analysis of SnS:Cu films using atomic force microscopy showed the roughness of vacuum annealed samples to be much lower than that of air annealed samples and confirming all the films to be crack free and devoid of pinholes. Chemical analyses with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy gives the binding energies of Sn3d5/2 at 485.5eV and S2p3/2 at 161.1eV, confirming the formation of SnS with Sn2+ and S−2 state. The hot probe measurements revealed their n-type nature, which was affirmed by Hall measurements too. Appreciable hike in conductivity is obtained through Cu-doping; however annealing could not produce any notable effect on conductivity.

Abstract: Osteoclastogenesis and osteolysis are energy-consuming processes supported by high metabolic activities. In human osteoclasts derived from the fusion of monocytic precursors, we found a substantial increase in the number of mitochondria with differentiation. In mature osteoclasts, mitochondria were also increased in size, rich of cristae and arranged in a complex tubular network. When compared with immature cells, fully differentiated osteoclasts showed higher levels of enzymes of the electron transport chain, a higher mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and a lower glycolytic efficiency, as evaluated by extracellular flux analysis and by the quantification of metabolites in the culture supernatant. Thus, oxidative phosphorylation appeared the main bioenergetic source for osteoclast formation. Conversely, we found that bone resorption mainly relied on glycolysis. In fact, osteoclast fuelling with galactose, forcing cells to depend on Oxidative Phosphorylation by reducing the rate of glycolysis, significantly impaired Type I collagen degradation, whereas non-cytotoxic doses of rotenone, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex I, enhanced osteoclast activity. Furthermore, we found that the enzymes associated to the glycolytic pathway are localised close to the actin ring of polarised osteoclasts, where energy-demanding activities associated with bone degradation take place. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the energy required for osteoclast differentiation mainly derives from mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, whereas the peripheral cellular activities associated with bone matrix degradation are supported by glycolysis. A better understanding of human osteoclast energy metabolism holds the potential for future therapeutic interventions aimed to target osteoclast activity in different pathological conditions of bone.

Abstract: Transparent conducting oxides (TCO) are crucial in amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells performance as they have to be highly conductive to ensure the transport of photogenerated charges while remaining highly transparent to the sun spectrum. The key parameter to improve the transparency/conductivity compromise of TCO is mobility, since it allows increasing conductivity without losing transparency in the infrared region. A deep understanding of the factors influencing the mobility is then fundamental, and this is the objective of this paper. For this study, thin films of tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) were prepared by magnetron sputtering with different oxygen content. They were deeply characterized by standard and Low Temperature Hall Effect measurement, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The impact of oxygen on the microstructure was studied and the electrical properties were deeply investigated. In particular, the different mechanisms impacting the mobility were quantified as a function of oxygen content during ITO deposition.

It was found that by keeping the same metal grid coverage, solar cells with 4- and 5-BB gave higher fill factor (FF) and energy conversion efficiency than the state-of-the-art 3-BB. This is attributed to decreased gridline resistance as the number of busbars increases from three to four, and four to five. The experimental I–V data showed an average increase in cell efficiency by 0.41%absolute and 0.66%absolute with 4-BB and 5-BB cells, respectively, compared to the 3-BB counterparts. By using the production emitter and commercial size of 239cm2, best efficiency of ~19.94% was achieved for a 5-BB Al-BSF cell.

Abstract: A new spectrally selective solar absorber coating of TiC/Al2O3 is prepared on stainless steel substrate using a magnetron sputtering method. The new coating exhibits a high absorptance of 0.92 and a low emittance of 0.13 (82°C). The tandem absorber is characterized using ultra-high resolution scanning electron microscope, UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The formation of amorphous carbon is due to the dissociation of TiC layer deposited under high substrate temperature (300°C). The diffused carbon at 600–800°C with mixed sp2 and sp3 bonds is further demonstrated by XPS and Raman spectra. With an increase in annealing temperature, the surface structure becomes more graphitic. The tandem absorber is stable in vacuum up to 650°C for 2h, indicating its importance for high temperature solar selective applications.

Abstract: The authors present a contactless optical characterization method for the study of metastable defects in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. A methodology for the analysis of time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) signals is presented. It leads to the observation of a hysteresis phenomenon regarding the minority carrier dynamics following the activation of the metastable defects. The amplitude of the hysteresis phenomena was compared between CIGS solar cells with different absorber/buffer layer interface properties. It is in these particular spatial regions where the metastable defects can be mostly found. The developed contactless characterization method was compared with classical current–voltage measurements. TRPL leads to a more complete understanding of the physics of metastable defects in terms of quantifying the shift in minority charge carriers dynamics that it induces.

Abstract: Interdigitated nanostructures can increase power conversion efficiency (PCE) by providing large interfaces for the dissociation of excitons and arrays for carrier transportation without recombination. Here, we reappraise the validity of donor–acceptor nanostructures composed of well-aligned porphyrin–fullerene nanopillars based on their contribution to the PCE compared with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) and bilayer (BL) organic photovoltaic solar cells (OPVs) with high efficiencies. Contrary to expectations, the results showed that poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6, 6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) interdigitated nanostructures hardly enhanced the PCE. We suggested three reasons focused on the morphological characteristics: the misbalanced carrier transit time caused by differences in the travel distances and carrier mobilities, detrimental effects on carrier transportation due to the overlap of the pathways to the electrodes, and the dependence of the PCE on the shapes and sizes of the nanostructures.

Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) imaging is a fast and contactless technique that allows visualizing defective regions of a solar cell where local carrier lifetime is reduced. In this paper we present a PL based method for the quantification of such defective areas in the case of a-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction solar cells produced in an industrial pilot line. After a description of the methodology used for obtaining a “defectivity parameter” Gd from the open-circuit PL images, we show that the efficiency of non-metallized cells produced in this line can be predicted from their Gd value with absolute deviations lower than 0.2%. Numerical calculations based on the two-diodes model are then used together with experimental results to investigate the impact of the defective regions on the cells performance. Finally, we focus on some defective regions using high resolution characterization tools such as SEM, EDX and µ-PL, and show that they can emanate from microscopic defects induced by the wafering step.

Abstract: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a key modulator of macrophage cholesterol homeostasis. We studied the impact of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on ABCA1 expression in primary human and THP-1 macrophages. Pharmacological or genetic activation of AMPK increased mRNA and protein expression of ABCA1 and its transcriptional activator liver X receptor (LXR) α, resulting in increased cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein AI-containing medium. On the other side, an AMPK knockdown decreased ABCA1 and LXRα mRNA and protein. Silencing LXRα, but not LXRβ, attenuated ABCA1 expression after AMPK activation, and luciferase reporter as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed the binding of LXRα to the LXR responsive element in the ABCA1 promoter. Inhibition of extracellular-signal regulated kinase and mechanistic target of rapamycin signalling increased ABCA1 expression, at the same time making it unresponsive to AMPK activation. Considering other potential regulators of ABCA1 expression, we excluded histone deacetylase HDAC9 and FOXO3 involvement in mediating AMPK effects on ABCA1. Our data link AMPK activation to an increased cholesterol efflux capacity of macrophages, suggesting an atheroprotective effect of macrophage AMPK.

Abstract: The present work describes the preparation and characterization of PEDOT films (different commercial screen-printing grades) mixed with intrinsically conductive materials such as graphene, graphite, silver nanowires or AZO (antimony doped zinc oxide) deposited on plastic and paper substrates using screen-printing. The final objective was to develop a material that could be used both as electrochromic material and as electrode (electrically conductive) for use in electrochromic devices, avoiding the use of an extra layer of conductive material such as a TCO, allowing the use of different substrates, shapes or sizes, because of the limitations found in TCO deposition. The resulting films were characterized in terms of electrical and optical properties, as well as electrochemical stability. Techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, UV–visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and mechanical tests were also used. Electrochromic devices (ECDs) were assembled using these PEDOT based electrodes. The performances of the resulting devices (3 layer structures) were compared with that of conventional ones (5 layer structures) through the analysis of the device color contrast over time during continuous operation conditions using a cycling program.

Abstract: Neural stem cells (NSCs) migration is essential for neurogenesis and neuroregeneration after brain injury. Nestin, a widely used marker of NSCs, is expressed abundantly in several cancers, where it may correlate with tumor migration and invasion. However, it is not yet known whether nestin participates in NSC migration. Here, we show that nestin down-regulation significantly inhibits the migration and contraction of murine neural stem cells, but does not obviously influence the proliferation, filamentous actin (F-actin) content, distribution or focal adhesion assembly of these cells. Mechanistically, nestin knockdown was found to affect the phosphorylation state of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) and regulate the activity of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that it interacts with MLCK and MRLC. Together, our results indicate that nestin may increase NSC motility via elevating MLCK activity through direct binding and provide new insight into the roles of nestin in NSC migration and repair.

Abstract: Vascular calcification (VC) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality in uremia. Post-translational core fucosylation is implicated in a number of pathological processes. First, we investigated the role of core fucosylation and key TGF-β1 pathway receptors in calcified arteries in vivo. To determine whether blocking core fucosylation effectively inhibited VC and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, we established an in vitro model of phosphate-induced calcification in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to assess the role of core fucosylation in VC. Core fucose could be detected at markedly higher levels in calcified VSMCs than control cells. Fut8 (α-1,6 fucosyltransferase), the only enzyme responsible for core fucosylation in humans, was significantly upregulated by high phosphate. Exposed to high phosphate media and blocking core fucosylation in VSMCs by knocking down Fut8 using a siRNA markedly reduced calcium and phosphorus deposition and Cbfα1 expression (osteoblast-specific transcription factor), and increased α-Sma expression (smooth muscle cell marker). Fut8 siRNA significantly inhibited TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling activation in VSMCs cultured in high phosphate media. In conclusion, this study provides evidence to suggest core fucosylation plays a major role in the process of VC and appropriate blockade of core fucosylation may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for treating VC in end-stage renal disease.

Abstract: In this study, the degradation effects of inverted metamorphic tri-junction (IMM3J) solar cells were investigated after 1MeV electron irradiation using spectral response and photoluminescence (PL) signal amplitude analysis, as well as electrical property measurements. The results show that, similar to traditional tri-junction (TJ) GaInP/GaAs/Ge solar cells, the electrical properties (such as Isc, Voc, and Pmax) degrade as a function of logφ, where φ represents the electron fluence. In particular, the degradation of Voc is more serious than that of Isc because of the sum rule for Voc and the limit rule for Isc in IMM3J cells. Analysis of the spectral response curves indicates that, unlike traditional TJ cells, the bottom In0.3Ga0.7As (1.0eV) sub-cell exhibits the most severe damage in the irradiated IMM3J cells. Meanwhile, the PL amplitude measurements qualitatively confirm that the degradation in the effective minority carrier lifetime τeff of single junction (SJ) In0.3Ga0.7As cells is more drastic than that of SJ GaAs cells after irradiation. Thus, the output current of the In0.3Ga0.7As sub-cell should be the rate-limiting cell in the irradiated IMM3J cells.

Abstract: The present work describes a method for the development of an efficient silver nanowire (AgNWs) embedded indium tin oxide (ITO) based silicon heterojunction solar cell. The working mechanism of the heterojunction solar cell is studied by using the current-voltage (J-V) and Impedance spectroscopy (IS) techniques. The charge transfer mechanism and recombination process of the solar cell were explained by resistance, capacitance and ideality factor derived from both these techniques. A relatively high efficiency has been achieved for AgNWs embedded ITO-Si heterojunction solar cell in which AgNWs network acts as a transparent buried contact. This study also provides a new architecture for various heterojunction solar cells with a simple route of fabrication.

Abstract: Thin films of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) were synthesized via a low cost, wet chemical technique of chemical bath deposition (CBD). In the first part of this study, the chemical composition ratio S/(Cu+Zn+Sn) was varied keeping Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn ratios constant to study the effect of sulfur variation. Detailed electrical and optical characterization has been carried out using UV-visible spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) techniques. The results of the present study confirm that near ideal stoichiometry could be achieved in CZTS by adding excess thiourea in a controlled manner which eliminated the need for an additional step of sulfurization. Using the stoichiometric sample as the basis, in the second part of the study Cu/(Zn+Sn) and Zn/Sn was varied and it was found that the electronic properties of CZTS in terms of band gap, work function and valence band edge position could be controlled by precursor variation. KPFM was used to qualitatively evaluate the photoresponse of the films and the Cu-poor, Zn-rich samples showed the best photoresponse out of all the samples which has been attributed to a decrease in the CuZn type defects. The study thus demonstrates a scalable and low-cost technique to grow CZTS absorber layers for solar cells with control over its electronic properties which is important for effective device operation.

Abstract: The present study was performed to examine the induction of apoptotic cell death and autophagy by blue LED irradiation, and the contribution of autophagy to apoptosis in B cell lymphoma A20 and RAMOS cells exposed to blue LED. Irradiation with blue LED reduced cell viability and induced apoptotic cell death, as indicated by exposure of phosphatidylserine on the plasma outside membrane and fragmentation of DNA. Furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential increased, and apoptotic proteins (PARP, caspase 3, Bax, and bcl-2) were observed. In addition, the level of intracellular superoxide anion (O2−) gradually increased. Interestingly the formation of autophagosomes and level of LC3-II were increased in blue LED-irradiated A20 and RAMOS cells, but inhibited after pretreatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), widely used as an autophagy inhibitor. Inhibition of the autophagic process by pretreatment with 3-MA blocked blue LED irradiation-induced caspase-3 activation. Moreover, a significant reduction of both the early and late phases of apoptosis after transfection with ATG5 and beclin 1 siRNAs was shown by the annexin V/PI staining, indicating a crucial role of autophagy in blue LED-induced apoptosis in cells. Additionally, the survival rate of mice irradiated with blue LED after injection with A20 cells increased compared to the control group. Our data demonstrate that blue LED irradiation induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial-mediated pathway, in conjunction with autophagy. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanism of blue LED-induced immune cell death.

Abstract: Inverted hole-transporting-layer (HTL) free planar perovskite solar cells are fabricated in ambient conditions. The perovskite layers are prepared via a two-step process on electrodeposited Cu2O particles, and a compact, homogenous, and pin-hole free morphology with extremely large grains are obtained. The high quality of the perovskite films is attributed to that the Cu2O particles can act as the growing sites of crystal nucleus of perovskite films during annealing. The optimized device shows a power conversion efficiency of 9.64%. Such a PCE is one of the highest values among the reported inverted HTL-free perovskite solar cells even it is fabricated in a high humidity condition.

Abstract: Leptin increases vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), and Notch expression in cancer cells, and transphosphorylates VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells. However, the mechanisms involved in leptin’s actions in endothelial cells are not completely known. Here we investigated whether a leptin-VEGFR-Notch axis is involved in these leptin’s actions. To this end, human umbilical vein and porcine aortic endothelial cells (wild type and genetically modified to overexpress VEGFR-1 or -2) were cultured in the absence of VEGF and treated with leptin and inhibitors of Notch (gamma-secretase inhibitors: DAPT and S2188, and silencing RNA), VEGFR (kinase inhibitor: SU5416, and silencing RNA) and leptin receptor, OB-R (pegylated leptin peptide receptor antagonist 2: PEG-LPrA2). Interestingly, in the absence of VEGF, leptin induced the expression of several components of Notch signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Inhibition of VEGFR and Notch signaling significantly decreased leptin-induced S-phase progression, proliferation, and tube formation in endothelial cells. Moreover, leptin/OB-R induced transphosphorylation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was essential for leptin’s effects. These results unveil for the first time a novel mechanism by which leptin could induce angiogenic features via upregulation/trans-activation of VEGFR and downstream expression/activation of Notch in endothelial cells. Thus, high levels of leptin found in overweight and obese patients might lead to increased angiogenesis by activating VEGFR-Notch signaling crosstalk in endothelial cells. These observations might be highly relevant for obese patients with cancer, where leptin/VEGFR/Notch crosstalk could play an important role in cancer growth, and could be a new target for the control of tumor angiogenesis.

Abstract: Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) solar cells with different S/(S+Se) (SSSe) ratios were fabricated using a sequential two-step sputtering and selenization/sulfurization process. The origins of the light soaking behavior in the CIGSSe absorber layer were studied based on the light soaking time (or dark storage time) dependence of the open circuit voltage (Voc) and built in potential (Vbi) as well as the temperature dependence of the current–voltage curve. In CIGSSe devices with a SSSe ratio >0.35, Voc and Vbi increase with increasing light soaking time and decrease with increasing dark storage time. In contrast, the Voc and Vbi of the CIGSSe devices with a SSSe ratio of approximately 0.25 showed slightly different behaviors, an increase with increasing light soaking time but little change with increasing dark storage time. The reasons for the different behavior in the CIGSSe devices with different SSSe ratios were attributed mainly to changes in the interface state by the SSSe ratio at the CIGSSe/buffer interface. The results suggest that the control of the SSSe ratio in the CIGSSe absorber fabricated by the proposed two-step process is an important key to determining the light soaking characteristics of the solar cell devices.

Abstract: Compound In2S3 powder was evaporated on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 substrates from the ZSW inline multi-stage co-evaporation process. Laboratory devices with the complete layer structure Mo/CIGS/In2Sx/i-ZnO/ZnO:Al/Ni–Al grid on 0.5cm2 total cell area were prepared and analysed for their J–V characteristics. A post-annealing step in air after completing the device is essential to enhance the cell performance. In this work the influence of window process conditions like process temperature, layer thickness and sputtering gas composition on the cell characteristics was investigated. Electrical characterisation by temperature-dependent current voltage and admittance spectroscopy were performed to better understand the impact of buffer parameters on electrical transport. By optimization of the buffer layer thickness in combination with window layer variations, cell efficiencies >16% could be achieved. A record cell efficiency of 18.2% with anti-reflective coating was obtained.

Abstract: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) represents a potential target to treat airway mucus hypersecretion in cystic fibrosis (CF). We aimed to determine if PPARγ is altered in CF human airway epithelial cells (HAECs), if PPARγ contributes to mucin expression and HAEC differentiation, and if PPARγ ligand therapy corrects the CF phenotype. To this end, well-differentiated CF and NCF HAEC primary cultures were wounded to monitor the expression of key genes involved in PPARγ activation and mucus homeostasis, and to evaluate the effect of a PPARγ agonist, at different times of repair. Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD) converts prostaglandin E2 to 15-keto PGE2 (15kPGE2), an endogenous PPARγ ligand. Interestingly, PPARγ and HPGD expression dramatically decreased in CF HAECs. These changes were accompanied by an increase in the expression of MUC5B. The correlation between PPARγ and MUC5B was confirmed in an airway epithelial cell line after CFTR knock-down. Exposure of HAECs to 15kPGE2 did not correct the CF phenotype but revealed a defect in the process of basal cell (BC) differentiation. The HPGD/PPARγ axis is deregulated in primary HAEC cultures from CF patients, which may impact the maturation of BCs to differentiated luminal cells. Importantly, PPARγ therapy was inefficient in correcting the CF defect.

Abstract: Poly(methyl methacrylate)/Rubitherm®27 (PMMA/RT27) microcapsules were successfully prepared without free PMMA particles as a byproduct by applying microsuspension iodine transfer radical polymerization (ms ITP) of methyl methacrylate/RT27 (=50/50, w/w) droplets containing benzoyl peroxide as initiator and iodoform as control agent dispersed in an aqueous medium for the first time. Both encapsulation efficiencies of RT27 and MMA were ~100%. The obtained microcapsules consisting of RT27 core and PMMA shell were spherical and had a smooth surface. The latent heats (J/g-RT27), which were obtained from experimental data on their latent heats (J/g-capsule) measured with a differential scanning calorimeter and RT27 content (g-RT27/g-capsule) measured with a thermogravimetric analyzer, of melting and solidification of the encapsulated RT27 in the PMMA/RT/27 microcapsule, were almost the same those of pure RT27. Before their measurements, the microcapsules were treated to remove unpolymerized MMA, free PMMA particles and free (unencapsulated) RT27.

Abstract: The photooxidation of a polymer blend film used in efficient solar cells based on poly[(4,40-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:20,30- d]silole)-2,6-diylalt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl], (Si-PCPDTBT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl (PC70BM) has been investigated. A set of experiments from complementary techniques was developed to monitor the modifications during ageing that occur not only in the bulk but also at the surface. The surface analyses were performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the bulk analyses by UV–visible spectroscopy and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The results reveal that the silicon bridge atom is the first target of degradation. We have identified the existence of a photooxidation profile within the 300nm thick film. Such a heterogeneous degradation was confirmed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) depth profiling.

Abstract: Cu2SnS3 is investigated as a potential solar absorber material, which is known to exist in several polymorphs. In the present work, the transition to the most efficient monoclinic polymorph is investigated and an explanation is given why this one seems to be the best for solar cells. Cubic, mixed polymorphs and monoclinic polymorphs are synthesised with increasing temperature. Photoluminescence spectra of the mixed and cubic polymorphs show mainly defect emissions below the band-gap energy, while the monoclinic modification shows only one sharp peak, which is attributed to the conduction to valence band transition. The monoclinic polymorph also grows in combination with a secondary phase containing sodium, NaxCuSnS3, with x between 0.5 and 1. It exhibits a cubic (F43m) crystal structure like CuSn3.75S8 and a band-gap of around 1.6eV. Devices with absorber layers of monoclinic Cu2SnS3, in which NaxCuSnS3 is either present or removed, gave similar power conversion efficiencies of above 1%.

Abstract: A novel tandem type of spectrally selective solar absorber using a homogeneous multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) coating as absorbing layer has been fabricated. The MWCNT absorber was prepared by facile and efficient electrophoretic deposition and exhibited good spectral selectivity. To assess the durability of the MWCNT absorber, condensation and thermal stability accelerated ageing tests were performed according to the international standard ISO 22975-3: absorber surface durability. The primary results revealed that the MWCNT absorber had a great thermal stability but was not resistant to condensation since the porous MWCNT coating permits water migration through the pores down to the aluminum substrate which as a result oxidizes, confirmed by the analysis of Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. Therefore, different types of thin films such as dense silica, silica-titania were deposited on top of MWCNT absorbers as protective layer to prevent the penetration of condensed water. Although all MWCNT absorbers coated with protective layer had little or no gain in spectral selectivity compared to those without protective layer, accelerated ageing tests indicated that the long-term durability was significantly improved. In thermal stability test, all protective layer coated MWCNT absorbers showed similar performance to the uncoated samples and had a negligible or even negative performance criterion (PC) value after 600h testing. In condensation test, the obtained PC values were 0.002, 0.013 and 0.014 for silica, 70/30 and 50/50 silica-titania film coated MWCNT absorbers respectively. All the PC values were less than 0.015 after 600h of accelerated ageing tests, which confirmed that the absorbers were qualified according to ISO 22975-3.

Abstract: For environmental assessment of photovoltaic systems generation from solar power, it is necessary to consider the fact that a sequence of activities must be accomplished in its production process, not only manufacturing but also installation for proper operation. According to the composition of the energy matrix of the country where this is done, a greater or smaller quantity of CO2 emissions will occur, apart from other environmental degradations. In this case the need of verification is evident, considering the energy matrix of the country where a panel is developed or used, its ability to depreciate the energetic cost and the CO2 emissions, as well as the degradations caused by the manufacturing process. After that, if the photovoltaic panel is still capable of functioning then it will be considered as a source of clean energy. This study has therefore surveyed the energetic costs and CO2 emissions of the manufacturing process of photovoltaic modules. Later this data was used to further analyze the energetic and CO2 mitigation balance and the module capacity for mitigating the environmental liabilities caused by production, by considering different production and using panel׳s sites. The results obtained demonstrated that the greater the emission factor of the panel production country, the greater the required time for emissions reduction due to its production. For instance, in case of panels produced in China and used in Brazil, they could have a truly clean useful life (EULT) up to three times lower than those produced in Germany. The implications of these results were discussed.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules printed on plastic substrates are attracting worldwide attention due to advantages such as flexibility, large-scale printability, lightweight, and potential utility for new products. However, exposure to atmospheric oxygen and water vapour is known to cause rapid device degradation and OPV devices thus require encapsulation using materials having ultra-low permeability to these atmospheric constituents to achieve the required operational lifetimes for commercial applications. In this work, various encapsulation architectures using flexible barrier films and adhesives available from commercial suppliers are developed and the lifetime of encapsulated large-area (active area ~50cm2) fully-printed OPV modules are assessed under ambient laboratory and outdoor conditions. New encapsulation architectures significantly enhance the durability of printed OPV modules, with results showing modules exhibiting a shelf-life of more than 5 years, and no evidence of degradation after 13 months׳ exposure under outdoor conditions.

Abstract: Efficient hydrogen production from water by photocatalysis under sunlight requires a significant improvement in light-harvesting capability. Zinc sulfide is a promising, inexpensive hydrogen generation photocatalyst, but in its pure, bulk form it is only active under ultra-violet light. Here, we show clear evidence of photoelectrochemical activity of ZnS thin films under visible-light irradiation without any co-catalysts, achieved through defect engineering. Fabrication of nanostructured ZnS under controlled conditions introduces defects, and hence intermediate electronic states within the band gap, which allow significant absorption of light at energies below the band gap energy of pure, bulk ZnS. The measured band gap of the ZnS thin films is ~2.4eV, while the photocurrent density exceeds 1.5mA/cm2 under visible-light irradiation (λ≥435nm). This is the first measurement of such high photocurrents for undoped ZnS under visible light.

Abstract: Copper–zinc–tin–sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4 or CZTS) is an important p-type semiconductor material for solar cell applications. A unique architecture for liquid junction solar cell made of ZnO/Al:ZnO/ZnS or ZnSe/CZTS core/shell vertically aligned nanorods array is reported. Over fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass, vertically aligned Al-doped zinc oxide nanorods (VANR) were grown over ZnO seed layer. It was followed by surface transformation of ZnO nanorods to ZnS or ZnSe through solubility constant (Ksp) difference induced anion exchange in a S2− or Se2− solution to produce ZnO/ZnS and ZnO/ZnSe core–shell (CS) structures. Separately, CZTS nanoparticles were synthesized from high temperature arrested precipitation and subsequently used for sensitization of ZnO/ZnS CS-VANR nanostructures. Cu2S and polysulfide were employed as counter-electrode and electrolyte respectively for fabrication of liquid junction solar cells. FE-SEM, HRTEM, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy techniques were employed for microstructural, morphological and compositional characterization of different component materials. The J–V measurements of the solar cell correspond to a several fold higher power conversion efficiency than similar device with thin film multilayer planar configuration involving same amount of materials. The aligned core/shell nanorods configuration offers an increase in the interfacial area by several folds, shorter pathway for charge transport and efficient photon absorption.

Irisin ameliorates hepatic glucose/lipid metabolism and enhances cell survival in insulin-resistant human HepG2 cells through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling,

Abstract: Irisin is a newly identified myokine that promotes the browning of white adipose tissue, enhances glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and modulates hepatic metabolism. However, the signaling pathways involved in the effects on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism have not been resolved. This study aimed to examine the role of irisin in the regulation of hepatic glucose/lipid metabolism and cell survival, and whether adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master metabolic regulator in the liver, is involved in irisin’s actions. Human liver-derived HepG2 cells were cultured in normal glucose-normal insulin (NGNI) or high glucose-high insulin (HGHI/insulin-resistant) condition. Hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism was evaluated by glucose output and glycogen content or triglyceride accumulation assays, respectively. Our results showed that irisin stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) via liver kinase B1 (LKB1) rather than Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) in HepG2 cells. Irisin ameliorated hepatic insulin resistance induced by HGHI condition. Irisin reduced hepatic triglyceride content and glucose output, but increased glycogen content, with those effects reversed by dorsomorphin, an AMPK inhibitor. Furthermore, irisin also stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation and promoted cell survival in an AMPK-dependent manner. In conclusion, our data indicate that irisin ameliorates dysregulation of hepatic glucose/lipid metabolism and cell death in insulin-resistant states via AMPK activation. These findings reveal a novel irisin-mediated protective mechanism in hepatic metabolism which provides a scientific basis for irisin as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: We investigated the surface properties of a Mo back contact for large-area thin-film solar modules with high efficiency and good adhesion between Mo and the absorber layer. It was determined that the appropriate surface properties of Mo would improve the efficiency from 10% to above 15.0±0.21% and narrow the efficiency distribution in large-area modules. The Mo back contact was annealed at various temperatures between room temperature and 230°C in air to control the amount of sodium diffusing from the soda-lime glass substrate during selenization and sulfurization, and to improve the uniformity of the unit cell. Before the heat treatment, the amount of sodium in the patterned area of the unit cell was more than 10 times of that in the central area of the cell. The patterned region with higher Na content had smaller grains than those in the central area with less Na, resulting in many peel-offs and shunting paths. The difference in sodium content was reduced after heat treatment. The optimized surface oxide of the Mo back contact had a thickness of around 3–5nm and consisted of the MoO3 phase. The grain boundary of Mo columnar structure near the surface consisted of the oxide layer.

To this end, poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanotubes were synthesized by simple electrochemical polymerization method on hydrothermally grown ZnO nanowires array as electrode. The PEDOT nanotubes of 20nm average wall thickness characterized by SEM, TEM and EDS. The manufactured cell was subjected to electrochemical test and spectrophotometery that showed high contrast of 54% during ultrafast switching time of <2.2ms. In addition, high coloration efficiency of 234cm2/C, ultrahigh diffusion coefficient of 2.01×10−4cm2/s and electrochemical stability were obtained. These make PEDOT nanotubes as an excellent candidate for low power, long term stable and transparent display.

Abstract: Hot carrier solar cells is an attractive technology with the potential of reaching high energy conversion efficiencies approaching the thermodynamic limit of infinitely stacked multi-junction solar cells: 65% under one sun and 86% under maximally concentrated. The hot carrier solar cell is conceptually simple consisting of two key components: absorber and energy selective contacts. High efficiencies are achieved by minimising the energy lost to thermalisaton of hot photo-generated carriers while absorbing majority of the solar spectrum. For this to be achieved, energy selective contacts are required to allow the extraction of carriers fast enough at an energy level above the electronic band edge. It is critical for the absorber to be able to maintain a hot carrier population for a sufficiently long time period for the extraction of carriers while they are ‘hot’. Bulk materials with a large gap between acoustic and optical branches in the phonon dispersion are predicted to exhibit slow hot carrier thermalisation rates. Hafnium nitride is such a material with a large gap in its phonon dispersion and is identified as a potential material to be used as a hot carrier absorber. Hafnium nitride has been deposited using reactive sputtering and characterised to investigate material properties and carrier cooling rates.

Abstract: Here we report a color palette of electrochromic (EC) nanoparticles (NPs) based on the Prussian blue (PB) family and present its promising multicolor thin film and device applications. We synthesized PB, cobalt-PB analogue (Co-PBA), nickel (Ni)-PBA, and copper (Cu)-PBA NPs and prepared the corresponding aqueous NP inks with or without 10vol% PEDOT:PSS additive. Uniform EC films with high visual contrast were coated onto ITO electrodes by repeated spin-coating of the NP inks. The EC films were characterized with SEM, cyclic voltammetry, Li+ diffusion speed, and in situ spectroelectrochemical methods. The EC colors of PB, Co-PBA, Ni-PBA, and Cu-PBA were achieved with these NP films. In particular, the PB NP film showed reversible green and yellow electrochromism that were not possible for an electrodeposited PB film, and Co-PBA, Ni-PBA and Cu-PBA films with sufficient thickness to exhibit visualized EC colors were also difficult to attain by electrodeposition. We also proved that a multicolor EC film could be prepared by a simple layer-by-layer interchanged coating of two different PBA NPs (e.g., PB and Ni-PBA). Finally, we assembled a new, multicolor, and full-PBA EC window prototype based on a PB/Ni-PBA working electrode and a Cu-PBA counterelectrode.

Abstract: A one-step method based on solution-processing has been adopted for preparing CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films. The role of chlorobenzene (CB) in film crystallization and the effect of subsequent thermal treatments on material properties has been investigated by performing a comparative study of solar cells developed with three groups of films processed differently. The use of CB promotes the formation of homogeneous films. Heat treatments at low temperature promote grain growth and agglomerations leading to decrease in surface roughness and the removal of chlorobenzene traces present in the film, which in turn leads to the improvement of the interface between the gold contact and perovskite layer. The cell parameters such as Voc, Jsc and solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of devices made with heat treated films are found to improve by 11%, 5% and 16% respectively with respect devices made from un-annealed films.

Abstract: We report a novel fabrication and multiple high resolution characterizations of Cu2ZnSnSe4 solar cells. The fabrication is based on nanoparticle precursor production by liquid-phase pulsed laser ablation (LP-PLA), electrophoretic deposition of precursor thin film under ambient condition, and selenization. Columnar grain boundaries are studied using spatially mapped Raman spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy for their compositional and electrical properties. We observe high electrical conductivity near columnar grain boundaries, and propose poor Cu composition as the cause of the enhancement of the collection of minority carriers. We also study horizontal grain boundaries using cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Combining with the device I-V and quantum efficiency, we suggest that the horizontal grain boundaries act as barriers to the transportation of minority carriers. CZTSe cells with efficiencies of 4.77% and 2.20% are compared.

Abstract: A novel phase-change composite based on hexadecanol and dye-linked polyurethane (dye-PU) was obtained in the present paper. Hexadecanol functions as a phase-change material (PCM) while dye-PU functions as both a supporting material and PCM, unlike in previous phase-change composites where it is used only as a general supporting material. FT-IR, XRD, DSC, and TG were employed to determine the structure and basic properties of the composite. The phase change enthalpy of the composite reached 229.5J/g, which was higher than that reported for most form-stable PCMs. The maximum weight percentage of hexadecanol that could be added to the composite without leakage was 63.8%. The linked dye absorbed visible light and converted it into thermal energy that could be stored by the phase-change material.

Abstract: Quantum dot (QD) has emerged as a promising agent in the field of solar energy conversion due to its distinct size-dependent optoelectronic characteristics. As next generation solar cell having facile and low cost fabrication techniques, quantum dot sensitized solar cell (QDSSC) has great potential to meet global demand for clean energy. In this type of solar cell architecture, high performance is expected due to multiple exciton generation effect and tuning of energy band gap in QD. As reported photo conversion efficiency of QDSSC is still less than dye sensitized solar cells, more research on optimization of material selection and material engineering is required. In this review paper, structure & working of QDSSC along with interfacial charge transportation mechanism is presented. Various fabrication techniques related to QDSSCs have been briefly described. This article focuses on recent advances in photoanode of QDSSC. It includes various aspects of photoanode such as structural, morphological effect, carbon related materials, doping effect in metal oxides, alternative photo-anodic materials, surface treatment, blocking layer, new types of sensitizer etc. Issues related to photoanode corrosion and stability are reviewed. Limitations and future prospects have been discussed to fabricate more efficient and stable quantum dot sensitized solar cell.

Abstract: Twist, a highly conserved basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor, functions as a major regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis. In different cell models, signaling pathways such as TGF-β, MAPK/ERK, WNT, AKT, JAK/STAT, Notch, and P53 have also been shown to play key roles in the EMT process, yet little is known about the signaling pathways regulated by Twist in tumor cells. Using iTRAQ-labeling combined with 2D LC–MS/MS analysis, we identified 194 proteins with significant changes of expression in MCF10A-Twist cells. These proteins reportedly play roles in EMT, cell junction organization, cell adhesion, and cell migration and invasion. ECM–receptor interaction, MAPK, PI3K/AKT, P53 and WNT signaling were found to be aberrantly activated in MCF10A-Twist cells. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis showed that integrin β1 (ITGB1) acts as a core regulator in linking integrin-linked kinase (ILK), Focal-adhesion kinase (FAK), MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and WNT signaling. Increased Twist and ITGB1 are associated with breast tumor progression. Twist transcriptionally regulates ITGB1 expression. Over-expression of ITGB1 or Twist in MCF10A led to EMT, activation of FAK/ILK, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and WNT signaling. Knockdown of Twist or ITGB1 in BT549 and Hs578T cells decreased activity of FAK, ILK, and their downstream signaling, thus specifically impeding EMT and cell invasion. Knocking down ILK or inhibiting FAK, MAPK/ERK, or PI3K/AKT signaling also suppressed Twist-driven EMT and cell invasion. Thus, the Twist-ITGB1-FAK/ILK pathway and their downstream signaling network dictate the Twist-induced EMT process in human mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells.

Abstract: ZnO nanoparticles are widely used as electron acceptors in hybrid polymer blend solar cells as well as electron extraction materials in organic solar cells. Here, a study of the photochemical and electronic stability of poly(3-hexyl thiophene)/zinc oxide nanoparticle (P3HT/ZnO) interfaces is presented. Photostability is compared with device stability of hybrid bulk heterojunction solar cells under light soaking and dark storage. We first investigate the photocatalytic properties of ZnO in P3HT:ZnO blend layers. The results indicated that the photocatalytic activity of ZnO nanoparticles drastically increases the photooxidation rate of P3HT. Photostability of P3HT:ZnO active layers was significantly improved when irradiation was performed in absence of UV radiations and in absence of oxygen. Using optimal conditions to avoid photodegradation during light soaking still leads to rapid performance losses revealing device degradation is not related to photodegradation of the hybrid polymer blend but to electronic modification during illumination. Importantly, both dark storage in air as well as light soaking experiments show that the stability of interfaces between P3HT and ZnO nanorods is higher than that observed in devices using ZnO nanospheres. This points towards the importance of the shape of the ZnO nanoparticles for long time stability in polymer solar cells.

Abstract: Today, almost all solution-processed absorber layers for CIGS thin-film solar cells require a gas-phase selenization step after film deposition. In this contribution, the addition of excess selenium to CIGS precursor inks, either as elemental Se particles or Se2−-containing salts, is investigated as an alternative way to induce selenization during thermal annealing. Most importantly, we find that (N2H5)2Se is a selenium-containing additive that both stabilizes CuInS2 nanocrystal inks and induces the formation of a pure CuInSe2 phase.

Abstract: The electronic structures of CdSe/CdTe type II colloidal quantum dots are predicted using a model based on k·p theory and the many-particle configuration interaction method. The separation of energy levels in the conduction band is examined and used to identify phonon bottlenecks, and how these evolve as the shell thickness is increased. Bottlenecks are found to persist both above and below the threshold for multiple exciton generation for all the shell thicknesses investigated. The overall electron cooling rate is thus expected to fall as the shell thickness is increased and Auger cooling suppressed, and this is confirmed experimentally using ultrafast transient absorption measurements. A reduced overall rate of electron cooling will enhance the quantum yield of multiple exciton generation with which it competes. Using a detailed-balance model, we have thus calculated that with proper design of core/and shell structures the efficiency of a solar cell based on CdSe/CdTe quantum dots can be enhanced to 36.5% by multiple exciton generation.

Abstract: Prussian blue (PB) powder, which could be dispersed uniformly in water, was prepared through a simple process, and is designated as water dispersible Prussian blue (wPB). A PB thin film was spray-coated on an ITO substrate using the ink of this powder. Another PB thin film was prepared by the electrochemical deposition method (EDPB) for comparison. The properties of these two thin films were compared by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A solid-state complementary electrochromic device (ECD) was fabricated based on a wPB thin film as the anodically coloring electrode and a poly(butyl viologen) (PBV) thin film as the cathodically coloring electrode. Succinonitrile (SN) with 0.1M potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (KTFSI) and silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanoparticles was used as the solid electrolyte. The device could be switched reversibly between blue–violet and transparent upon application of 1.7V and −1.0V, and showed an initial transmittance change of 62.5% with a coloration efficiency of 157cm2/C at 545nm. The switching time required for both darkening and bleaching was about 10s for a sample of 2.0×2.0cm2. As for the electrochemical stability of the ECD, the transmittance change reached 58.4% at 545nm after 1000 cycles, and the darkened state transmittance remained relatively constant after the same period.

Abstract: This paper reports on the use of AAO layers as a source of p-type dopants for laser doping processes that forms localised p+ regions on Si surfaces. Sheet resistances as low as 2Ω/sq were demonstrated when a laser was used to scribe through a region of AAO using a speed of 500mm/s and power of 9W. Unlike laser-doping through spin-coated polyboron sources, it was shown that laser doping through AAO layers can be performed without introducing any voids into the Si and form a local BSF ~5µm into Si which is advantageous for PERL cell structure. This co-doping process was used to fabricate rear-passivated cells with efficiencies of up to 19.9%. However, although the heavily-doped local p+ regions could reduce Rs to values as low as 0.54Ωcm2, there was a penalty in terms of a high ideality factor in the Vmp –Voc voltage range which limited FFs to ~76%.

Abstract: Age-related, non-communicable chronic inflammatory diseases represent the major 21st century health problem. Especially in Western countries, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis are exponentially rising as the population ages. These diseases are determined by common risk factors and share an age-related onset. The affected organs display evidence of accelerated ageing, and are hallmarked by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been implicated in a number of inflammatory diseases and plays a central role in amplifying inflammatory responses. Advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation and accumulation is accelerated under these conditions. Advanced glycation end products are not only linked to RAGE signaling and inflammation, but to various hallmarks of the ageing process. In addition to these biological functions, circulating levels of the soluble form of RAGE and of advanced glycation end products are candidate biomarkers for many age-related inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the mechanistic connections between RAGE and advanced glycation end products and the processes of inflammation and ageing. Furthermore, through the presented overview of AGE-RAGE alterations that have been described in clinical studies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis, and insight obtained from mechanistic in vitro and animal studies, it can be concluded that these AGE-RAGE disturbances are a common contributing factor to the inflammatory state and pathogenesis of these various conditions.

Abstract: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and Z-scheme bridge are the most important roles of noble metal nanoparticles for photocatalysis. In this study, the size-dependent role of gold (Au) in Au/g-C3N4/BiOBr system was studied for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and dye degradation. The results revealed that big Au nanoparticles mainly displayed Z-scheme bridge role, and g-C3N4/BiOBr/Au-B showed higher photocatalytic activity than g-C3N4/BiOBr under 380nm monochromatic light irradiation. Small Au nanoparticles mainly displayed SPR role, and g-C3N4/BiOBr/Au-S showed higher photocatalytic activity than g-C3N4/BiOBr under 550nm monochromatic light irradiation. The size-dependent role of Au nanoparticles for photocatalytic system should be due to the SPR effect of small Au nanoparticles and electron transfer center of big Au nanoparticles. This finding can guide us to prepare high photocatalytic activity noble metal loaded photocatalysts.

Abstract: Periodontal disease (PD), a degenerative bacterially induced disease of periodontium, can lead to bone resorption and teeth loss. Development of PD includes a strong inflammatory reaction, which involves multiple immune cells and their secreting factors including interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is not only an important modulator of immune and hematopoietic responses but also affects bone metabolism. In the present study we aimed to determine whether IL-17 affects the regenerative potential of periodontal ligament mesenchymal stem cells (PDLSCs) by investigating its ability to modulate osteogenic differentiation of these cells in vitro along with associated signaling pathways. Our results revealed that IL-17 inhibited both the proliferation and migration of PDLSCs and decreased their osteogenic differentiation by activating ERK1,2 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases. Obtained data suggested that IL-17 might contribute to alveolar bone loss in PD.

Abstract: Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) has recently been suggested to be associated with drug resistance in breast cancer patients. However, the precise role of GRP78 in drug resistance and the involved signaling pathways are not clearly understood. In the present study, we show that among a panel of drugs, namely Paclitaxel (TAX), Doxorubicin (DOX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), UCN-01 and Tamoxifen (TAM) used, TAM alone up-regulated the expression of GRP78 significantly and induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, inhibition of GRP78 by a specific pharmacological inhibitor, VER-155008 augmented TAM-induced apoptosis, and overexpression of GRP78 rendered the cells resistant to TAM-induced cell death suggesting a role for GRP78 in TAM-induced cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, the expression of phosphorylated AKT as determined by Western blot analyses revealed that TAM selectively upregulated phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308 but not at Ser473, and siRNA silencing of GRP78 resulted in inhibition of AKT phosphorylation at Thr308 but not at Ser473. Further, a GRP78 inhibitor, VER155008 inhibited TAM-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β, a downstream substrate of AKT. These results, thus suggests a role for GRP78 in TAM-induced AKT activation. Additionally, co-localization studies by immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a complex formation of AKT and GRP78. Furthermore, in glucose-free medium, the cells were sensitized to TAM-induced cell death that was associated with reduced AKT phosphorylation at Thr308, thus strengthening the association of AKT regulation with drug response. Collectively, our findings identify a role of GRP78 in AKT regulation in response to TAM in breast cancer cells.

Thioredoxin-interacting protein regulates lipid metabolism via Akt/mTOR pathway in diabetic kidney disease,

Abstract: Abnormal lipid metabolism contributes to the renal lipid accumulation, which is associated with diabetic kidney disease, but its precise mechanism remains unclear. The growing evidence demonstrates that thioredoxin-interacting protein is involved in regulating cellular glucose and lipid metabolism. Here, we investigated the effects of thioredoxin-interacting protein on lipid accumulation in diabetic kidney disease. In contrast to the diabetic wild-type mice, the physical and biochemical parameters were improved in the diabetic thioredoxin-interacting protein knockout mice. The increased renal lipid accumulation, expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, and phosphorylated Akt and mTOR associated with diabetes in wild-type mice was attenuated in diabetic thioredoxin-interacting protein knockout mice. Furthermore, thioredoxin-interacting protein knockout significantly increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferaser 1 in diabetic kidneys. In vitro experiments, using HK-2 cells, revealed that knockdown of thioredoxin-interacting protein inhibited high glucose-mediated lipid accumulation, expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, as well as activation of Akt and mTOR. Moreover, knockdown of thioredoxin-interacting protein reversed high glucose-induced reduction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferaser 1 expression in HK-2 cells. Importantly, blockade of Akt/mTOR signaling pathway with LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, replicated these effects of thioredoxin-interacting protein silencing. Taken together, these data suggest that thioredoxin-interacting protein deficiency alleviates diabetic renal lipid accumulation through regulation of Akt/mTOR pathway, thioredoxin-interacting protein may be a potential therapeutic target for diabetic kidney disease.

Abstract: The large open circuit voltage (Voc) deficit (Eg/q-Voc) is the key factor limiting the current efficiency of pure sulfide Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin film solar cells. This present work reports CZTS devices with a Voc of over 710mV by utilizing either In2S3 buffer or In2S3/CdS hybrid buffer. The improvement in Voc mainly results from (i) an increased carrier concentration in CZTS due to In-doping when the In2S3 buffer is adjacent to the CZTS absorber and (ii) favorable conduction band alignments at the CZTS/buffer interface. However, devices with In2S3 buffers suffer from having a lower Fill Factor (FF) and short circuit current density (Jsc) when compared with those with CdS buffers. In contrast devices with In2S3/CdS hybrid buffers not only yield an enhancement in Voc, but also give the same level of FF and an even higher Jsc relative to CdS buffers, thereby increasing the efficiency from 5.5% to 6.6%. These hybrid In2S3/CdS buffers provide a promising way to reduce the Voc deficit and further boost the efficiency of pure sulfide CZTS solar cells.

Abstract: A Cu2O homojunction solar cell was fabricated using a consecutive electrodeposition method of deposition of an n-Cu2O film followed by a p-Cu2O film, in two different acetate baths. Both n-type and p-type film growth conditions were optimized separately to yield high photocurrents in a photoelctrochemical (PEC) cell. Further, the resulted bi-layer films were investigated in the PEC for the verification of the formation of the p-n homojunction. In addition, p-Cu2O film surfaces of the bi-layers were sulphided using Na2S and (NH4)2S in order to improve the photoresponse of the homojunction before depositing a Au film for the solar cell device. The structural, morphological and optoelectronic properties of the Cu2O films were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron micrographs (SEMs), dark and light current–voltage (I-V) and spectral response measurements and observed that the films are of good quality. Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) and I-V characteristics of the solar cell device demonstrated that the Cu2O homojunction can produce a high short circuit current density Jsc. However, the overall conversion efficiency of the device is low due to poor fill factor and Voc. The solar cell characteristics of the structure Ti/n-Cu2O/p-Cu2O/Au were Voc=287.0±0.1mV, Jsc=12.4±0. 1mA/cm2, FF=25±2% and η=0.89±0.02%, under AM 1.5 illumination. The record high Jsc value of the device demonstrates the prospect being improved the efficiency of Cu2O homojunction solar cells by optimizing deposition, pretreatment and post treatment processes.

Abstract: In this work, a new material was developed to be used as the active electrode in an electrochromic device based on layer-by-layer poly(o-methoxyaniline) and poly(3-thiopheneacetic acid) films. Its properties were compared to a poly(o-methoxyaniline) film prepared by casting with similar electrochemical properties. The film preparation technique, layer-by-layer, guarantees molecular interaction between layers. In this case, the interaction leads to a self-doping effect, inhibiting the ion transport from the solution to the polymer which is the rate limiting step during the device operation. The results show both a decrease in the time constant for color change as well as a strong increase in the coloration efficiency, from 144.7 to 542cm2C−1 for POMA casting and LBL films, respectively.

Abstract: We investigated the response of roll coated organic solar cells at different bias voltages and illumination levels to implement a detailed impedance model. The technique used for the investigation is based on the combination of standard DC characterization with the impedance spectroscopy at different bias and illumination intensity conditions. We analyzed both fresh and intentionally degraded cells. The impedance spectra show different peaks evolutions, depending on the degradation of the cells. Moreover, the same trend appears by measuring the cell at different illumination levels. To describe the cell impedance behaviors we suggest an electrical model based on distributed elements. By fitting the model to experimental data, we extrapolate the parameters related to electron transport, recombination and accumulation. The main differences between fresh and degraded samples are underlined.

Abstract: Compared to traditional electrochromic technology, photovoltaic electrochromic (PV-EC) module can achieve color change in electrochromic layers without additional power source. In this work, an innovative printable PV-EC module is provided. The device includes a plurality of planarly distributed silicon thin film solar cells (Si-TFSCs) configured in superstrate structure, covered with a layer of polyelectrolyte based electrochromic thin film (ECTF). The Si-TFSC consists of one anode (with a portion of area exposed from the Si-TFSC), a photoelectric conversion layer, and one cathode. The ECTF is prepared from nano-size polyelectrolyte based electrochromic material, which is composed of polyaniline (PANI) and polyanion poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) nanospheres mixture. When the printable PV-EC module is irradiated by sunlight, the PANI/PSS ECTF on the surface of the transparent anode layer exhibits anodic color changing, and transforms from pale green (emeraldine salt state) to light blue (emeraldine blue state).

Abstract: This research studies a binary mixture composed of sodium nitrate and urea for use as a phase change material in latent thermal energy storage systems between 75 and 90°C. This range of temperatures is suitable for heating and domestic hot water applications, such as solar thermal systems and cogeneration devices. The work is divided into two parts. In this Part I, the phase diagram of the system was experimentally determined via DSC, the synthetic visual method and X–ray diffraction. A eutectic composition was found at 71.25% (w/w) urea and 28.75% (w/w) sodium nitrate. The main thermal properties and density of this composition were studied in detail to evaluate its potential as a PCM. The results showed a melting temperature of 85°C and a melting enthalpy of 172J/g. These properties are suitable for the intended purpose. Currently, the mixture presents a market price below 1€/kg, which is highly competitive. In Part II, the water uptake of the material was evaluated to gain knowledge of its hygroscopic behavior. In addition, because urea undergoes thermal degradation upon heating, a preliminary accelerated thermal cycling test was performed to study the thermal reliability of the mixture. According to the results, the eutectic mixture formed by sodium nitrate and urea has potential for use as a PCM in the intended temperature range. Further research focused on thermal degradation over longer periods of use is encouraged to establish whether the material has a proper lifespan for actual thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: The Cry1Ac toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis is used commercially as a bio-insecticide and is expressed in transgenic plants that are used for human and animal consumption. Although it was originally considered innocuous for mammals, the Cry1Ac toxin is not inert and has the ability to induce mucosal and systemic immunogenicity. Herein, we examined whether the Cry1Ac toxin promotes macrophage activation and explored the signalling pathways that may mediate this effect. Treatment of primary and RAW264.7 macrophages with the Cry1Ac toxin resulted in upregulation of the costimulatory molecules CD80, CD86 and ICOS-L and enhanced production of nitric oxide, the chemokine MCP-1 and the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Remarkably, the Cry1Ac toxin induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK1/2, JNK and p38 and promoted nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p50 and p65. p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs were involved in this effect, as indicated by the Cry1Ac-induced upregulation of CD80 and IL-6 and TNF-α abrogation by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Furthermore, treatment the MEK1/2 kinase inhibitor PD98059 blocked increases in MCP-1 secretion and augmented Cry1Ac-induced ICOS-L upregulation. These data demonstrate the capacity of the Cry1Ac toxin to induce macrophage activation via the MAPK and NF-κB pathways.

Abstract: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide released by motor neuron in skeletal muscle and modulates the neuromuscular transmission by induction of synthesis and insertion of acetylcholine receptor on postsynaptic muscle membrane; however, its role in skeletal muscle protein metabolism remains unclear. We examined the in vitro and in vivo effects of CGRP on protein breakdown and signaling pathways in control skeletal muscles and muscles following denervation (DEN) in rats. In isolated muscles, CGRP (10−10 to 10−6M) reduced basal and DEN-induced activation of overall proteolysis in a concentration-dependent manner. The in vitro anti-proteolytic effect of CGRP was completely abolished by CGRP8-37, a CGRP receptor antagonist. CGRP down-regulated the lysosomal proteolysis, the mRNA levels of LC3b, Gabarapl1 and cathepsin L and the protein content of LC3-II in control and denervated muscles. In parallel, CGRP elevated cAMP levels, stimulated PKA/CREB signaling and increased Foxo1 phosphorylation in both conditions. In denervated muscles and starved C2C12 cells, Rp-8-Br-cAMPs or PKI, two PKA inhibitors, completely abolished the inhibitory effect of CGRP on Foxo1, 3 and 4 and LC3 lipidation. A single injection of CGRP (100μgkg−1) in denervated rats increased the phosphorylation levels of CREB and Akt, inhibited Foxo transcriptional activity, the LC3 lipidation as well as the mRNA levels of LC3b and cathepsin L, two bona fide targets of Foxo. This study shows for the first time that CGRP exerts a direct inhibitory action on autophagic-lysosomal proteolysis in control and denervated skeletal muscle by recruiting cAMP/PKA signaling, effects that are related to inhibition of Foxo activity and LC3 lipidation.

Abstract: Film uniformity and large crystalline size are indispensable and critical for obtaining high performance planar perovskite solar cells. Perovskite precursor composition plays a key role in the formation of high quality perovskite films. In this work, excess PbCl2 is deliberately introduced, and is found to facilitate the solubility of CH3NH3I in concentrated solution at room temperature. The excess PbCl2 is found to alter the formation pathway of perovskite thin films. Accordingly, the formation pathway is proposed. Analysis of the perovskite films and associated devices revealed that extremely uniform perovskite films consisting of large grains of several microns can be obtained with a small amount of excess PbCl2. The associated planar perovskite solar cells showed a reliable and reproducible efficiency of 16.1%.

Abstract: Carbon and/or nitrogen doped TiO2 mesoporous beads have been prepared using hexamethylenetetramine as the dopant source in a microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthetic route. It is found that the hydrothermal time has pronounced effects on the crystallinity, grain size, and carbon and/or nitrogen incorporation into the TiO2 lattices. The carbon and/or nitrogen doping creates interband localized states above the valence band of TiO2 and therefore enhances the optical response of TiO2 in the visible light region. Selected carbon and/or nitrogen doped TiO2 mesoporous beads are made into flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs), which are analyzed by solar simulator, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy, and incident photon-to electron conversion efficiency. The photoelectrode consisting of the doped TiO2 mesoporous beads shows improved FDSSCs due to the better electron injection and collection efficiencies. The electron lifetime is also relatively high, indicating that the doping does not introduce recombination. Overall speaking, both improved optical and electronic properties are demonstrated and discussed in depth.

Abstract: Proteolytic enzymes mediate the activation or inactivation of many physiologic and pathologic processes. The PHEX gene (Phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidase on the X chromosome) encodes a metallopeptidase, which is mutated in patients with a prevalent form (1:20,000) of inherited rickets-X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). XLH shows growth retardation, hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, and defective renal phosphate reabsorption and metabolism of vitamin D. Most PHEX studies have focused on bone, and recently we identified osteopontin (OPN) as the first protein substrate for PHEX, demonstrating in the murine model of XLH (Hyp mice) an increase in OPN that contributes to the osteomalacia. Besides its role in bone mineralization, OPN is expressed in many tissues, and therein has different functions. In tumor biology, OPN is known to be associated with metastasis. Here, we extend our PHEX-OPN studies to investigate PHEX expression in a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell line and its possible involvement in modulating OPN function. Real-time PCR showed PHEX-OPN co-expression in SCC cells, with sequencing of the 22 exons showing no mutation of the PHEX gene. Although recombinant PHEX hydrolyze SCC-OPN fragments, unlike in bone cells, SCC-PHEX protein was not predominantly at the plasma membrane. Enzymatic activity assays, FACs and immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that membrane PHEX is degraded by cysteine proteases and the decreased PHEX activity could contribute to inappropriate OPN regulation. These results highlight for the first time PHEX in tumor biology.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFβ1) and Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) are involved in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis of various cell types. In previous studies, we have shown that TGFβ1 and PTEN play an important role in the progression of pulmonary vascular remodeling induced by pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). However, the mechanisms involved in the activation of PASMCs between TGFβ1 and PTEN pathways remain unknown. We found that pulmonary vascular walls in hypoxic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) rats were thicker than the vessels from normal rats in vivo. Substantially higher levels of TGFβ1 and significant loss of PTEN expression were observed in the lungs of PAH rats when compared with normoxia. Meanwhile, AKT, a downstream proliferative signaling protein of the PTEN antagonist PI3K, was markedly activated in the lungs of PAH rats. In vitro studies using PASMCs showed that TGFβ1 increased cell proliferation in PTEN-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that TGFβ1 enhanced cell survival, up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and procaspase-3, decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells and caspase-3 expression in PASMCs under serum-deprived (SD) condition via PI3K/AKT pathway. The results further establish that TGFβ1 promoted PAH by decreasing PTEN expression and increasing PI3K/AKT activation in the lung. In conclusion, TGFβ1 mediated PTEN inactivation and resistance to apoptosis seems to be key mediators of lung vascular remodeling associated with PAH. These findings further clarify molecular mechanisms that support targeting PTEN/AKT signaling pathway to attenuate pathogenic derangements in PAH.

Abstract: Cu12Sb4S13 is a very potential non-toxic, earth-abundant absorber material for thin film solar cells yet its photovoltaic related properties are rarely explored so far. In this paper, we first developed a hydrazine solution process to fabricate phase-pure, highly crystalline, large grain Cu12Sb4S13 film and then carried out investigations to study the chemical, optical and electrical properties of Cu12Sb4S13 film in detail. Careful X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicated Cu12Sb4S13 could be oxidized into Cu3SbS4 in a sulfur rich atmosphere at elevated temperature, and the valance states of our Cu12Sb4S13 are determined as Cu+12Sb3+3Sb5+1S2−13 rather than the previously reported Cu+10Cu22+Sb3+4S2−13. Optical absorption investigation showed that Cu12Sb4S13 has a direct band gap of 1.47eV. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) study revealed that the conduction band and valence band are located at −3.52eV and −4.99eV relative to the vacuum level, respectively. Finally, we built a photodetector based on Cu12Sb4S13 film achieving 0.15A/W responsivity and a heterojunction solar cell having 0.04% solar conversion efficiency. Our preliminary experimental study indicated that Cu12Sb4S13 may be a very attractive absorber material for photovoltaic application.

Abstract: In this report, spinel NiCo2O4 nanobelts anchored on reduced graphene oxide (NiCo2O4@RGO) have been synthesized by a hydrothermal reduction process and used as counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Without RGO, the NiCo2O4 nanobelts tend to aggregate and form sarciniform patterns. By introducing RGO, the NiCo2O4 nanobelts are dispersed on graphene sheets uniformly. The DSSC based on NiCo2O4 nanobelts CE achieves power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.20% and a higher PCE (6.17%) on NiCo2O4@RGO nanocomposite, which was comparable to the Pt CE (6.07%). The cyclic voltammetry tests (CV) analysis indicates that the NiCo2O4@RGO CE gives a more stable catalytic activity for triiodide reduction than NiCo2O4 CE does. Due to the existence of RGO, the composite possesses both higher efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed and secondly leading cause of cancer death among males. But the precise mechanism of prostate cancer progression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) functioning in it, is still needs further study. We found miR-27a to be down-regulated in prostate cancer, and we investigated the mechanism and role of miRNA-27a in prostate cancer. MiR-27a, a transcriptional target of AR, was an androgen-induced miRNA in LNCaP cells. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells, we for the first time reported that miR-27a was downregulated by PI3K signaling. MiR-27a functioned as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Over-expression of miR-27a decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration, and induced prostate cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. MAP2K4, miR-27a’s direct target gene, functioned as an oncogene in prostate cancer by reducing G1-S phase arrest and inhibiting cell apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. In conclusion, miR-27a functions as a tumor suppressor by suppressing MAP2K4 which acts as an oncogene in prostate cancer cell lines; we also provided a new mechanism of castration-resistant prostate cancer mediated by miR-27a that downregulation of miR-27a caused by aberrant AR signaling and PI3K/Akt signaling after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) would promote the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Abstract: In this work, we determine experimentally the dielectric function of monoclinic Cu2SnS3 (CTS) by spectroscopic ellipsometry from 0.7 to 5.9eV. An experimental approach is proposed to overcome the challenges of extracting the dielectric function of Cu2SnS3 when grown on a glass/Mo substrate, as relevant for photovoltaic applications. The ellipsometry measurement reveals a double absorption onset at 0.91eV and 0.99eV. Importantly, we demonstrate that calculation within the density functional theory (DFT) confirms this double onset only when a very dense k-mesh is used to reveal fine details in the electronic structure, and this can explain why it has not been reported in earlier calculated spectra. We can now show that the double onset originates from optical transitions at the Γ-point from three energetically close-lying valence bands to a single conduction band. Thus, structural imperfection, like secondary phases, is not needed to explain such an absorption spectrum. Finally, we show that the absorption coefficient of CTS is particularly large in the near-band gap spectral region when compared to similar photovoltaic materials.

Abstract: A cost effective, facile and scalable method to fabricate the stable broadband antireflective (AR) surface on glass substrates for solar energy applications is still a challenge. In this paper, we have demonstrated a simple and non-lithographic method to fabricate the broadband quasi-omnidirectional AR nanoporous surface on glass substrates by hydrofluoric (HF) acid based vapor phase etching method. Both-sides etched sodalime glass substrate under optimized conditions showed broadband enhanced transmittance with maximum total transmittance of ~97% at 598nm. The measured transmittance exceeds by ~5.4% as compared to plain glass (91.6%). Field emission scanning electron microscopy results showed that an AR nanoporous surface with graded porosity was formed on sodalime glass substrate after etching. Due to the graded porosity, the fabricated nanoporous surface on sodalime glass substrate showed excellent broadband enhanced transmittance, and exhibited low reflectance <2.8% over a wide range of incidence angles (8–48°). The mechanism of nanostructured surface formation and the effect of etching parameters on transmittance have been discussed in detail. To get more insight, the theoretical transmittance of the optimized sample has been determined by finite difference time domain simulation, which confirms a good agreement of AR property with the experimental results. Furthermore, these AR nanoporous surface showed good adhesion property, excellent thermal and chemical stability, and exhibited outstanding stability against outdoor exposure. These properties signify its strong potential in various solar energy devices.

Abstract: KLF10 is a transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad downstream regulated gene. KLF10 binds to the promoter of target genes and mimics the effects of TGF-β as a transcriptional factor. In our laboratory, we noted that Klf10 deficiency in mice is associated with significant inflammation of the lungs. However, the precise mechanism of this association remains unknown. We previously identified NPRA as a target gene potentially regulated by KLF10 through direct binding; NPRA knockout have known that prevented lung inflammation in a mouse model of allergic asthma. Here, we further explored the regulatory association between KLF10 and NPRA on the basis of the aforementioned findings. Our results demonstrated that KLF10 acts as a transcriptional repressor of NPRA and that KLF10 binding reduces NPRA expression in vitro. Compared with wild-type mice, Klf10-deficient mice were more sensitive to lipopolysaccharide or ovalbumin challenge and showed more severe inflammatory histological changes in the lungs. Moreover, Klf10-deficient mice showed pulmonary neutrophil accumulation. These findings collectively reveal the precise site where KLF10 signaling affects pulmonary inflammation by attenuating NPRA expression. They also verify the importance of KLF10 and atrial natriuretic peptide/NPRA in exerting influences on chronic pulmonary disease pathogenesis.

Abstract: AKAP12/Gravin (A kinase anchor protein 12) belongs to the group of A-kinase scaffold proteins and functions as a tumor suppressor in some human primary cancers. While AKAP12 is found consistently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its involvement in hepatocarcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated. We identified targeting sites for miR-103 in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of AKAP12 by bioinformatic analysis and confirm their function by a luciferase reporter gene assay. We reveal miR-103 expression to be inversely correlated with AKAP12 in HCC tissue samples and show that overexpressed miR-103 promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis by downregulating AKAP12 expression in HCC cell lines. On the other hand, repression of miR-103 suppresses proliferation and promotes apoptosis in HCC cells by increasing AKAP12. In xenografted HCC tumors, overexpression of AKAP12 suppresses tumor growth whereas overexpression of miR-103 enhances tumor growth while repressing AKAP12. Since the activation of telomerase is crucial for cells to gain immortality and proliferation ability, we investigated whether AKAP12 expression affected telomerase activity in HCC cells. Both AKAP12 overexpression and protein kinase Cα (PKCα) inhibition prevent nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of TERT and reduce telomerase activity in HCC cells. These findings indicate that miR-103 potentially acts as an oncogene in HCC by inhibiting AKAP12 expression and raise the possibility that miR-103 increases telomerase activity by increasing PKCα activity. Thus, miR-103 may represent a new potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for HCC treatment.

Abstract: This manuscript focuses on the fabrication of metal–semiconductor (M–S) hybrid thin films using simple and cost-effective spray pyrolysis technique. Various host matrices were chosen to demonstrate the versatility of our technique. The absorption characteristics of in-situ grown noble metal nanoparticles into the various host matrices (CdS, ZnO, ZnS, PbS, CuInS2) have been demonstrated. The brilliant colors of M–S films are because of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption governed by the metal nanoparticles size, shape, morphology and the dielectric constant of the host matrix. The SPR peak due to the gold (Au) domains was observed in the visible–NIR region (550–1000nm) which can be tuned with Au loading in the host matrix. The structural and morphological characterizations were carried out using XRD and TEM that reveals the distinct phases of Au and host material. The in-situ growth mechanism of Au domains in the host matrix has been also described.

Abstract: Stainless steels (SS) 310, 321, 347, Incoloy 800H (In800H), alumina-forming austenitic (AFA-OC6), Ni superalloy Inconel 625 (IN625), and MCrAlX (M: Ni, and/or Co; X: Y, Hf, Si, and/or Ta) coatings were corroded in molten carbonates in N2 and bone-dry CO2 atmospheres. Electrochemical tests in molten eutectics K2CO3–Na2CO3 and Na2CO3–K2CO3–Li2CO3 at temperatures higher than 600°C were evaluated using an open-circuit potential followed by a potentiodynamic polarization sweep to determine the corrosion rates. Because the best-performing alloys at 750°C were In800H followed by SS310, these two alloys were selected as the substrate material for the MCrAlX coatings. The coatings were able to mitigate corrosion in molten carbonates environments. The corrosion of substrates SS310 and In800H was reduced from ~2500µm/year to 34µm/year when coated with high-velocity oxyfuel (HVOF) NiCoCrAlHfSiY and pre-oxidized (air, 900°C, 24h, 0.5°C/min) before molten carbonate exposure at 700°C in bone-dry CO2 atmosphere. Metallographic characterization of the corroded surfaces showed that the formation of a uniform alumina scale during the pre-oxidation seems to protect the alloy from the molten carbonate attack.

Abstract: An approach to improve the efficiency of donor-acceptor based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells is the use of low band gap (LBG) polymers as donor materials. The properties of these materials in BHJ solar cells are strongly influenced by their morphology and ability for self-organization in thin-films. We studied for two related polymer pairs the influence of the introduction of additional (hexyl-) thiophene moieties on both the electronic structure and ability for self-organization in thin films using Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and Near-Edge X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS). In addition, the influence of mixing with PCBM and post-processing annealing on the molecular orientation is investigated. We find that the introduction of additional (hexyl-) thiophene moieties in the polymer structure does not affect significantly the electronic structure of the polymers in thin films, but has a strong impact on their self-organization properties and consequently affects their behavior in devices.
