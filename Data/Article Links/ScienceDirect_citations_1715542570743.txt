Abstract: Mitochondrial activity warrants energy supply to oxidative myofibres to sustain endurance workload. The maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis is ensured by the control of fission and fusion processes and by the mitophagic removal of aberrant organelles. Many diseases are due to or characterized by dysfunctional mitochondria, and altered mitochondrial dynamics or turnover trigger myopathy per se. In this review, we will tackle the role of mitochondrial dynamics, turnover and metabolism in skeletal muscle, both in health and disease.
Keywords: Mitochondrial calcium uptake; Skeletal muscle; Mitophagy; Mitochondrial myopathies; Fusion and fission machinery

Abstract: Summary
Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-mediated adaptive resistance is one major barrier to improving immunotherapy in solid tumors. However, the mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we report that IFN-γ promotes nuclear translocation and phase separation of YAP after anti-PD-1 therapy in tumor cells. Hydrophobic interactions of the YAP coiled-coil domain mediate droplet initiation, and weak interactions of the intrinsically disordered region in the C terminus promote droplet formation. YAP partitions with the transcription factor TEAD4, the histone acetyltransferase EP300, and Mediator1 and forms transcriptional hubs for maximizing target gene transcriptions, independent of the canonical STAT1-IRF1 transcription program. Disruption of YAP phase separation reduced tumor growth, enhanced immune response, and sensitized tumor cells to anti-PD-1 therapy. YAP activity is negatively correlated with patient outcome. Our study indicates that YAP mediates the IFN-γ pro-tumor effect through its nuclear phase separation and suggests that YAP can be used as a predictive biomarker and target of anti-PD-1 combination therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Acetylation of lysine 16 on histone H4 (H4K16ac) is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferase KAT8 and can prevent chromatin compaction in vitro. Although extensively studied in Drosophila, the functions of H4K16ac and two KAT8-containing protein complexes (NSL and MSL) are not well understood in mammals. Here, we demonstrate a surprising complex-dependent activity of KAT8: it catalyzes H4K5ac and H4K8ac as part of the NSL complex, whereas it catalyzes the bulk of H4K16ac as part of the MSL complex. Furthermore, we show that MSL complex proteins and H4K16ac are not required for cell proliferation and chromatin accessibility, whereas the NSL complex is essential for cell survival, as it stimulates transcription initiation at the promoters of housekeeping genes. In summary, we show that KAT8 switches catalytic activity and function depending on its associated proteins and that, when in the NSL complex, it catalyzes H4K5ac and H4K8ac required for the expression of essential genes.

Abstract: HTRA (High temperature requirement protease A) family proteins includes HTRA1 (L56 or PRSS11), HTRA2/Omi, HTRA3 (PRSP) and HTRA4. These are oligomeric serine proteases highly conserved from bacteria to humans and are involved in a variety of biological functions including the maintenance of normal cell physiology and pathogenicity such as cell growth, apoptosis, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammation diseases and cancer. These proteins are normally expressed in placental villi during all pregnancy but their expression is found to be altered in pathological pregnancies suggesting a possible role of those proteins in the development of human placenta. Moreover, some HTRA family proteins have also been found in maternal blood and were impaired in pathological pregnancy suggesting a possible role of some of these proteins as early markers of pregnancy outcome. The aim of this review is to summarize the data currently available on the role of HTRA family proteins in pregnancy focalizing their role in pregnancy complications such as Preeclampsia (PE), IntraUterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) and Spontaneus PreTerm Birth (SPTB).

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns are created by transcription factors that recruit methylation and demethylation enzymes to cis-regulatory elements. To date, it is not known whether transcription factors are needed to continuously maintain methylation profiles in development and mature tissues or whether they only establish these marks during organ development. We queried the role of the pioneer factor FoxA in generating hypomethylated DNA at liver enhancers. We discovered a set of FoxA-binding sites that undergo regional, FoxA-dependent demethylation during organ development. Conditional ablation of FoxA genes in the adult liver demonstrated that continued FoxA presence was not required to maintain the hypomethylated state, even when massive cell proliferation was induced. This study provides strong evidence for the stable, epigenetic nature of tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns directed by lineage-determining transcription factors during organ development.

Abstract: Summary
Ibrutinib, a bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, provokes robust clinical responses in aggressive mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), yet many patients relapse with lethal Ibrutinib-resistant (IR) disease. Here, using genomic, chemical proteomic, and drug screen profiling, we report that enhancer remodeling-mediated transcriptional activation and adaptive signaling changes drive the aggressive phenotypes of IR. Accordingly, IR MCL cells are vulnerable to inhibitors of the transcriptional machinery and especially so to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), the catalytic subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Further, CDK9 inhibition disables reprogrammed signaling circuits and prevents the emergence of IR in MCL. Finally, and importantly, we find that a robust and facile ex vivo image-based functional drug screening platform can predict clinical therapeutic responses of IR MCL and identify vulnerabilities that can be targeted to disable the evolution of IR.

Abstract: Summary
Roles for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in gene regulation remain largely unexplored. With hundreds of rDNA units positioned across multiple loci, it is not possible to genetically modify rRNA in mammalian cells, hindering understanding of ribosome function. It remains elusive whether expansion segments (ESs), tentacle-like rRNA extensions that vary in sequence and size across eukaryotic evolution, may have functional roles in translation control. Here, we develop variable expansion segment-ligand chimeric ribosome immunoprecipitation RNA sequencing (VELCRO-IP RNA-seq), a versatile methodology to generate species-adapted ESs and to map specific mRNA regions across the transcriptome that preferentially associate with ESs. Application of VELCRO-IP RNA-seq to a mammalian ES, ES9S, identified a large array of transcripts that are selectively recruited to ribosomes via an ES. We further characterize a set of 5′ UTRs that facilitate cap-independent translation through ES9S-mediated ribosome binding. Thus, we present a technology for studying the enigmatic ESs of the ribosome, revealing their function in gene-specific translation.

Abstract: Summary
The human placenta and its specialized cytotrophoblasts rapidly develop, have a compressed lifespan, govern pregnancy outcomes, and program the offspring’s health. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of these behaviors informs development and disease. Profiling the extraembryonic epigenome and transcriptome during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters revealed H3K9 trimethylation overlapping deeply DNA hypomethylated domains with reduced gene expression and compartment-specific patterns that illuminated their functions. Cytotrophoblast DNA methylation increased, and several key histone modifications decreased across the genome as pregnancy advanced. Cytotrophoblasts from severe preeclampsia had substantially increased H3K27 acetylation globally and at genes that are normally downregulated at term but upregulated in this syndrome. In addition, some cases had an immature pattern of H3K27ac peaks, and others showed evidence of accelerated aging, suggesting subtype-specific alterations in severe preeclampsia. Thus, the cytotrophoblast epigenome dramatically reprograms during pregnancy, placental disease is associated with failures in this process, and H3K27 hyperacetylation is a feature of severe preeclampsia.

Abstract: Summary
Human brain development is a complex process involving neural proliferation, differentiation, and migration that are directed by many essential cellular factors and drivers. Here, using the NetBID2 algorithm and developing human brain RNA sequencing dataset, we identify synaptotagmin-like 3 (SYTL3) as one of the top drivers of early human brain development. Interestingly, SYTL3 exhibits high activity but low expression in both early developmental human cortex and human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neurons. Knockout of SYTL3 (SYTL3-KO) in human neurons or knockdown of Sytl3 in embryonic mouse cortex markedly promotes neuronal migration. SYTL3-KO causes an abnormal distribution of deep-layer neurons in brain organoids and reduces presynaptic neurotransmitter release in hESC-derived neurons. We further demonstrate that SYTL3-KO-accelerated neuronal migration is modulated by high expression of matrix metalloproteinases. Together, based on bioinformatics and biological experiments, we identify SYTL3 as a regulator of cortical neuronal migration in human and mouse developing brains.

Abstract: Summary
Exploitation of naturally occurring genetic mutations could empower the discovery of novel aspects of established cancer genes. We report here that TRPS1, a gene linked to the tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome (TRPS) and recently identified as a potential breast cancer driver, promotes breast carcinogenesis through regulating replication. Epigenomic decomposition of TRPS1 landscape reveals nearly half of H3K9me3-marked heterochromatic origins are occupied by TRPS1, where it encourages the chromatin loading of APC/C, resulting in uncontrolled origin refiring. TRPS1 binds to the genome through its atypical H3K9me3 reading via GATA and IKAROS domains, while TRPS-related mutations affect its chromatin binding, replication boosting, and tumorigenicity. Concordantly, overexpression of wild-type but not TRPS-associated mutants of TRPS1 is sufficient to drive cancer genome amplifications, which experience an extrachromosomal route and dynamically evolve to confer therapeutic resistance. Together, these results uncover a critical function of TRPS1 in driving heterochromatin origin firing and breast cancer genome evolution.

Abstract: Summary
About 150 post-transcriptional RNA modifications have been identified in all kingdoms of life. During RNA catabolism, most modified nucleosides are resistant to degradation and are released into the extracellular space. In this study, we explored the physiological role of these extracellular modified nucleosides and found that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), widely recognized as an epigenetic mark in RNA, acts as a ligand for the human adenosine A3 receptor, for which it has greater affinity than unmodified adenosine. We used structural modeling to define the amino acids required for specific binding of m6A to the human A3 receptor. We also demonstrated that m6A was dynamically released in response to cytotoxic stimuli and facilitated type I allergy in vivo. Our findings implicate m6A as a signaling molecule capable of activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and triggering pathophysiological responses, a previously unreported property of RNA modifications.

Abstract: Summary
The DREAM complex orchestrates cell quiescence and the cell cycle. However, how the DREAM complex is deregulated in cancer remains elusive. Here, we report that PAF (PCLAF/KIAA0101) drives cell quiescence exit to promote lung tumorigenesis by remodeling the DREAM complex. PAF is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and is associated with poor prognosis. Importantly, Paf knockout markedly suppressed LUAD development in mouse models. PAF depletion induced LUAD cell quiescence and growth arrest. PAF is required for the global expression of cell-cycle genes controlled by the repressive DREAM complex. Mechanistically, PAF inhibits DREAM complex formation by binding to RBBP4, a core DREAM subunit, leading to transactivation of DREAM target genes. Furthermore, pharmacological mimicking of PAF-depleted transcriptomes inhibited LUAD tumor growth. Our results unveil how the PAF-remodeled DREAM complex bypasses cell quiescence to promote lung tumorigenesis and suggest that the PAF-DREAM axis may be a therapeutic vulnerability in lung cancer.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation is implicated in neuronal biology via the protein MeCP2, the mutation of which causes Rett syndrome. MeCP2 recruits the NCOR1/2 co-repressor complexes to methylated cytosine in the CG dinucleotide, but also to sites of non-CG methylation, which are abundant in neurons. To test the biological significance of the dual-binding specificity of MeCP2, we replaced its DNA binding domain with an orthologous domain from MBD2, which can only bind mCG motifs. Knockin mice expressing the domain-swap protein displayed severe Rett-syndrome-like phenotypes, indicating that normal brain function requires the interaction of MeCP2 with sites of non-CG methylation, specifically mCAC. The results support the notion that the delayed onset of Rett syndrome is due to the simultaneous post-natal accumulation of mCAC and its reader MeCP2. Intriguingly, genes dysregulated in both Mecp2 null and domain-swap mice are implicated in other neurological disorders, potentially highlighting targets of relevance to the Rett syndrome phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Muscle satellite cells (SCs) are a quiescent (non-proliferative) stem cell population in uninjured skeletal muscle. Although SCs have been investigated for nearly 60 years, the molecular drivers that transform quiescent SCs into the rapidly dividing (activated) stem/progenitor cells that mediate muscle repair after injury remain largely unknown. Here we identify a prominent FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (Fos) mRNA and protein signature in recently activated SCs that is rapidly, heterogeneously, and transiently induced by muscle damage. We further reveal a requirement for FOS to efficiently initiate key stem cell functions, including cell cycle entry, proliferative expansion, and muscle regeneration, via induction of “pro-regenerative” target genes that stimulate cell migration, division, and differentiation. Disruption of one of these Fos/AP-1 targets, NAD(+)-consuming mono-ADP-ribosyl-transferase 1 (Art1), in SCs delays cell cycle entry and impedes progenitor cell expansion and muscle regeneration. This work uncovers an early-activated FOS/ART1/mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) pathway that is essential for stem cell-regenerative responses.

Abstract: Summary
Exhausted immune responses to chronic diseases represent a major challenge to global health. We study CD4+ T cells in a mouse model with regulatable antigen presentation. When the cells are driven through the effector phase and are then exposed to different levels of persistent antigen, they lose their T helper 1 (Th1) functions, upregulate exhaustion markers, resemble naturally anergic cells, and modulate their MAPK, mTORC1, and Ca2+/calcineurin signaling pathways with increasing dose and time. They also become unable to help B cells and, at the highest dose, undergo apoptosis. Transcriptomic analyses show the dynamic adjustment of gene expression and the accumulation of T cell receptor (TCR) signals over a period of weeks. Upon antigen removal, the cells recover their functionality while losing exhaustion and anergy markers. Our data suggest an adjustable response of CD4+ T cells to different levels of persisting antigen and contribute to a better understanding of chronic disease.

Abstract: Summary
The diversity of circulating human B cells is unknown. We use single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to examine the diversity of both antigen-specific and total B cells in healthy subjects and malaria-exposed individuals. This reveals two B cell lineages: a classical lineage of activated and resting memory B cells and an alternative lineage, which includes previously described atypical B cells. Although atypical B cells have previously been associated with disease states, the alternative lineage is common in healthy controls, as well as malaria-exposed individuals. We further track Plasmodium-specific B cells after malaria vaccination in naive volunteers. We find that alternative lineage cells are primed after the initial immunization and respond to booster doses. However, alternative lineage cells develop an atypical phenotype with repeated boosts. The data highlight that atypical cells are part of a wider alternative lineage of B cells that are a normal component of healthy immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Despite their diverse biochemical characteristics and functions, all DNA-binding proteins share the ability to accurately locate their target sites among the vast excess of non-target DNA. Toward identifying universal mechanisms of the target search, we used single-molecule tracking of 11 diverse DNA-binding proteins in living Escherichia coli. The mobility of these proteins during the target search was dictated by DNA interactions rather than by their molecular weights. By generating cells devoid of all chromosomal DNA, we discovered that the nucleoid is not a physical barrier for protein diffusion but significantly slows the motion of DNA-binding proteins through frequent short-lived DNA interactions. The representative DNA-binding proteins (irrespective of their size, concentration, or function) spend the majority (58%–99%) of their search time bound to DNA and occupy as much as ∼30% of the chromosomal DNA at any time. Chromosome crowding likely has important implications for the function of all DNA-binding proteins.

Abstract: Cleft lip and/or palate are a split in the lip, the palate or both. This results from the inability of lip buds and palatal shelves to properly migrate and assemble during embryogenesis. By extracting primary cells from a cleft patient, we aimed at offering a better understanding of the signaling mechanisms and interacting molecules involved in the lip and palate formation and fusion. With Rho GTPases being indirectly associated with cleft occurrence, we investigated the role of the latter in both. First, whole exome sequencing was conducted in a patient with cleft lip and palate. Primary fibroblastic cells originating from the upper right gingiva region were extracted and distinct cellular populations from two individuals were obtained: a control with no cleft phenotype and a patient with a cleft lip and palate. The genetic data showed three candidate variables in ARHGEF18, EPDR1, and CUL7. Next, the molecular data showed no significant change in proliferation rates between healthy patient cells and CL/P patient cells. However, CL/P patient cells showed decreased migration, increased adhesion and presented with a more elongated phenotype. Additionally, RhoA activity was upregulated in these cells, whereas Cdc42 activity was downregulated, resulting in loss of polarity. Our results are suggestive of a possible correlation between a dysregulation of Rho GTPases and the observed phenotype of cleft lip and palate patient cells. This insight into the intramolecular aspect of this disorder helps link the genetic defect with the observed phenotype and offers a possible mechanism by which CL/P occurs.

Abstract: Summary
Synapses exhibit multiple forms of short-term plasticities, which have been attributed to the heterogeneity of neurotransmitter release probability. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the differential release states remain to be fully elucidated. The Unc-13 proteins appear to have key roles in synaptic function through multiple regulatory domains. Here, we report that deleting the M domain in Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-13MR leads to a significant increase in release probability, revealing an inhibitory function of this domain. The inhibitory effect of this domain is eliminated when the C1 and C2B domains are absent or activated, suggesting that the M domain inhibits release probability by suppressing the activity of C1 and C2B domains. When fused directly to the MUNC2C fragment of UNC-13, the M domain greatly enhances release probability. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism by which the UNC-13 M domain regulates synaptic transmission and provides molecular insights into the regulation of release probability.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies with heavy chains that derive from the VH1-2 gene constitute some of the most potent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-neutralizing antibodies yet identified. To provide insight into whether these genetic similarities inform common modes of recognition, we determine the structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in complex with three VH1-2-derived antibodies: 2-15, 2-43, and H4. All three use VH1-2-encoded motifs to recognize the receptor-binding domain (RBD), with heavy-chain N53I-enhancing binding and light-chain tyrosines recognizing F486RBD. Despite these similarities, class members bind both RBD-up and -down conformations of the spike, with a subset of antibodies using elongated CDRH3s to recognize glycan N343 on a neighboring RBD—a quaternary interaction accommodated by an increase in RBD separation of up to 12 Å. The VH1-2 antibody class, thus, uses modular recognition encoded by modular genetic elements to effect potent neutralization, with the VH-gene component specifying recognition of RBD and the CDRH3 component specifying quaternary interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant expression of nuclear transporters and deregulated subcellular localization of their cargo proteins are emerging as drivers and therapeutic targets of cancer. Here, we present evidence that the nuclear exporter exportin-6 and its cargo profilin-1 constitute a functionally important and frequently deregulated axis in cancer. Exportin-6 upregulation occurs in numerous cancer types and is associated with poor patient survival. Reducing exportin-6 level in breast cancer cells triggers antitumor effects by accumulating nuclear profilin-1. Mechanistically, nuclear profilin-1 interacts with eleven-nineteen-leukemia protein (ENL) within the super elongation complex (SEC) and inhibits the ability of the SEC to drive transcription of numerous pro-cancer genes including MYC. XPO6 and MYC are positively correlated across diverse cancer types including breast cancer. Therapeutically, exportin-6 loss sensitizes breast cancer cells to the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor JQ1. Thus, exportin-6 upregulation is a previously unrecognized cancer driver event by spatially inhibiting nuclear profilin-1 as a tumor suppressor.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical definitions of asthma fail to capture the heterogeneity of immune dysfunction in severe, treatment-refractory disease. Applying mass cytometry and machine learning to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, we find that corticosteroid-resistant asthma patients cluster largely into two groups: one enriched in interleukin (IL)-4+ innate immune cells and another dominated by interferon (IFN)-γ+ T cells, including tissue-resident memory cells. In contrast, BAL cells of a healthier population are enriched in IL-10+ macrophages. To better understand cellular mediators of severe asthma, we developed the Immune Cell Linkage through Exploratory Matrices (ICLite) algorithm to perform deconvolution of bulk RNA sequencing of mixed-cell populations. Signatures of mitosis and IL-7 signaling in CD206−FcεRI+CD127+IL-4+ innate cells in one patient group, contrasting with adaptive immune response in T cells in the other, are preserved across technologies. Transcriptional signatures uncovered by ICLite identify T-cell-high and T-cell-poor severe asthma patients in an independent cohort, suggesting broad applicability of our findings.

Abstract: Astroglial aerobic glycolysis, a process during which d-glucose is converted to l-lactate, a brain fuel and signal, is regulated by the plasmalemmal receptors, including adrenergic receptors (ARs) and purinergic receptors (PRs), modulating intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP signals. However, the extent to which the two signals regulate astroglial aerobic glycolysis is poorly understood. By using agonists to stimulate intracellular α1-/β-AR-mediated Ca2+/cAMP signals, β-AR-mediated cAMP and P2R-mediated Ca2+ signals and genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based glucose and lactate nanosensors in combination with real-time microscopy, we show that intracellular Ca2+, but not cAMP, initiates a robust increase in the concentration of intracellular free d-glucose ([glc]i) and l-lactate ([lac]i), both depending on extracellular d-glucose, suggesting Ca2+-triggered glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis in astrocytes. When the glycogen shunt, a process of glycogen remodelling, was inhibited, the α1-/β-AR-mediated increases in [glc]i and [lac]i were reduced by ∼65 % and ∼30 %, respectively, indicating that at least ∼30 % of the utilization of d-glucose is linked to glycogen remodelling and aerobic glycolysis. Additional activation of β-AR/cAMP signals aided to α1-/β-AR-triggered [lac]i increase, whereas the [glc]i increase was unaltered. Taken together, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ is the prime mechanism of augmented aerobic glycolysis in astrocytes, while cAMP has only a moderate role. The results provide novel information on the signals regulating brain metabolism and open new avenues to explore whether astroglial Ca2+ signals are dysregulated and contribute to neuropathologies with impaired brain metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Using intravital imaging, we report that bone marrow (BM) plasma cells (PCs) are motile. BM PCs exhibit a unique migration pattern, characterized by intermittent periods of high motility and longer stretches of confined migration or arrest. BM PCs accumulate into clusters, which have reduced cell motility. APRIL promotes cluster formation and overall PC motility in the BM. Although CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4, promote PC motility in the BM, VLA4 activity promotes arrest. However, blocking either pathway promotes PC egress from the BM. Under steady-state conditions, BM PCs recirculate to other bones and spleen. In older mice, overall PC motility and recirculation increase, and this is correlated with increased CXCR4 expression, which depends on PC age or maturation rather than mouse age. Altogether, these results suggest that changes in PC motility and CXCR4 expression are linked with survival of long-lived PCs in the BM.

Abstract: Summary
Osteoblasts orchestrate bone formation through the secretion of type I collagen and other constituents of the matrix on which hydroxyapatite crystals mineralize. Here, we show that TENT5A, whose mutations were found in congenital bone disease osteogenesis imperfecta patients, is a cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase playing a crucial role in regulating bone mineralization. Direct RNA sequencing revealed that TENT5A is induced during osteoblast differentiation and polyadenylates mRNAs encoding Col1α1, Col1α2, and other secreted proteins involved in osteogenesis, increasing their expression. We postulate that TENT5A, possibly together with its paralog TENT5C, is responsible for the wave of cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNAs encoding secreted proteins occurring during bone mineralization. Importantly, the Tent5a knockout (KO) mouse line displays bone fragility and skeletal hypomineralization phenotype resulting from quantitative and qualitative collagen defects. Thus, we report a biologically relevant posttranscriptional regulator of collagen production and, more generally, bone formation.

Abstract: Summary
Dendrites are crucial for integrating incoming synaptic information. Individual dendritic branches are thought to constitute a signal processing unit, yet how neighboring synapses shape the boundaries of functional dendritic units is not well understood. Here, we address the cellular basis underlying the organization of the strengths of neighboring Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses by optical quantal analysis and spine size measurements. Inducing potentiation at clusters of spines produces NMDA-receptor-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity. The direction of postsynaptic strength change shows distance dependency to the stimulated synapses where proximal synapses predominantly depress, whereas distal synapses potentiate; potentiation and depression are regulated by CaMKII and calcineurin, respectively. In contrast, heterosynaptic presynaptic plasticity is confined to weakening of presynaptic strength of nearby synapses, which requires CaMKII and the retrograde messenger nitric oxide. Our findings highlight the parallel engagement of multiple signaling pathways, each with characteristic spatial dynamics in shaping the local pattern of synaptic strengths.

Abstract: Summary
Harnessing the microbiota for beneficial outcomes is limited by our poor understanding of the constituent bacteria, as the functions of most of their genes are unknown. Here, we measure the growth of a barcoded transposon mutant library of the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron on 48 carbon sources, in the presence of 56 stress-inducing compounds, and during mono-colonization of gnotobiotic mice. We identify 516 genes with a specific phenotype under only one or a few conditions, enabling informed predictions of gene function. For example, we identify a glycoside hydrolase important for growth on type I rhamnogalacturonan, a DUF4861 protein for glycosaminoglycan utilization, a 3-keto-glucoside hydrolase for disaccharide utilization, and a tripartite multidrug resistance system specifically for bile salt tolerance. Furthermore, we show that B. thetaiotaomicron uses alternative enzymes for synthesizing nitrogen-containing metabolic precursors based on ammonium availability and that these enzymes are used differentially in vivo in a diet-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
In response to stress, human cells coordinately downregulate transcription and translation of housekeeping genes. To downregulate transcription, the negative elongation factor (NELF) is recruited to gene promoters impairing RNA polymerase II elongation. Here we report that NELF rapidly forms nuclear condensates upon stress in human cells. Condensate formation requires NELF dephosphorylation and SUMOylation induced by stress. The intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in NELFA is necessary for nuclear NELF condensation and can be functionally replaced by the IDR of FUS or EWSR1 protein. We find that biomolecular condensation facilitates enhanced recruitment of NELF to promoters upon stress to drive transcriptional downregulation. Importantly, NELF condensation is required for cellular viability under stressful conditions. We propose that stress-induced NELF condensates reported here are nuclear counterparts of cytosolic stress granules. These two stress-inducible condensates may drive the coordinated downregulation of transcription and translation, likely forming a critical node of the stress survival strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Most RNA processing occurs co-transcriptionally. We interrogated nascent pol II transcripts by chemical and enzymatic probing and determined how the “nascent RNA structureome” relates to splicing, A-I editing and transcription speed. RNA folding within introns and steep structural transitions at splice sites are associated with efficient co-transcriptional splicing. A slow pol II mutant elicits extensive remodeling into more folded conformations with increased A-I editing. Introns that become more structured at their 3′ splice sites get co-transcriptionally excised more efficiently. Slow pol II altered folding of intronic Alu elements where cryptic splicing and intron retention are stimulated, an outcome mimicked by UV, which decelerates transcription. Slow transcription also remodeled RNA folding around alternative exons in distinct ways that predict whether skipping or inclusion is favored, even though it occurs post-transcriptionally. Hence, co-transcriptional RNA folding modulates post-transcriptional alternative splicing. In summary, the plasticity of nascent transcripts has widespread effects on RNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Calcium transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria is a critical contributor to apoptosis. B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) ovarian killer (BOK) localizes to the ER and binds the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosophate receptor (IP3R). Here, we show that BOK is necessary for baseline mitochondrial calcium levels and stimulus-induced calcium transfer from the ER to the mitochondria. Murine embryonic fibroblasts deficient for BOK have decreased proximity of the ER to the mitochondria and altered protein composition of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which form essential calcium microdomains. Rescue of the ER-mitochondrial juxtaposition with drug-inducible interorganelle linkers reveals a kinetic disruption, which when overcome in Bok−/− cells is still insufficient to rescue thapsigargin-induced calcium transfer and apoptosis. Likewise, a BOK mutant unable to interact with IP3R restores ER-mitochondrial proximity, but not ER-mitochondrial calcium transfer, MAM protein composition, or apoptosis. This work identifies the dynamic coordination of ER-mitochondrial contact by BOK as an important control point for apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
We have analyzed the link between the gene regulation and growth during the early stages of flower development in Arabidopsis. Starting from time-lapse images, we generated a 4D atlas of early flower development, including cell lineage, cellular growth rates, and the expression patterns of regulatory genes. This information was introduced in MorphoNet, a web-based platform. Using computational models, we found that the literature-based molecular network only explained a minority of the gene expression patterns. This was substantially improved by adding regulatory hypotheses for individual genes. Correlating growth with the combinatorial expression of multiple regulators led to a set of hypotheses for the action of individual genes in morphogenesis. This identified the central factor LEAFY as a potential regulator of heterogeneous growth, which was supported by quantifying growth patterns in a leafy mutant. By providing an integrated view, this atlas should represent a fundamental step toward mechanistic models of flower development.

Abstract: Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite and replicates inside a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within the host cell. The membrane of the PV (PVM) contains pores that permits for equilibration of ions and small molecules between the host cytosol and the PV lumen. Ca2+ signaling is universal and both T. gondii and its mammalian host cell utilize Ca2+ signals to stimulate diverse cellular functions. Egress of T. gondii from host cells is an essential step for the infection cycle of T. gondii, and a cytosolic Ca2+ increase initiates a Ca2+ signaling cascade that culminates in the stimulation of motility and egress. In this work we demonstrate that intracellular T. gondii tachyzoites are able to take up Ca2+ from the host cytoplasm during host cell signaling events. Both intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ sources are important in reaching a threshold of parasite cytosolic Ca2+ needed for successful egress. Two peaks of Ca2+ were observed in egressing single parasites with the second peak resulting from Ca2+ entry. We patched infected host cells to allow the delivery of precise concentrations of Ca2+ for the stimulation of motility and egress. Using this approach of patching infected host cells, allowed us to determine that increasing the host cytosolic Ca2+ to a specific concentration can trigger egress, which is further accelerated by diminishing the concentration of potassium (K+).

Abstract: Summary
Aggressive brain tumors like glioblastoma depend on support by their local environment and subsets of tumor parenchymal cells may promote specific phases of disease progression. We investigated the glioblastoma microenvironment with transgenic lineage-tracing models, intravital imaging, single-cell transcriptomics, immunofluorescence analysis as well as histopathology and characterized a previously unacknowledged population of tumor-associated cells with a myeloid-like expression profile (TAMEP) that transiently appeared during glioblastoma growth. TAMEP of mice and humans were identified with specific markers. Notably, TAMEP did not derive from microglia or peripheral monocytes but were generated by a fraction of CNS-resident, SOX2-positive progenitors. Abrogation of this progenitor cell population, by conditional Sox2-knockout, drastically reduced glioblastoma vascularization and size. Hence, TAMEP emerge as a tumor parenchymal component with a strong impact on glioblastoma progression.

Abstract: Summary
Fast-dissociating, specific antibodies are single-molecule imaging probes that transiently interact with their targets and are used in biological applications including image reconstruction by integrating exchangeable single-molecule localization (IRIS), a multiplexable super-resolution microscopy technique. Here, we introduce a semi-automated screen based on single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of antibody-antigen binding, which allows for identification of fast-dissociating monoclonal antibodies directly from thousands of hybridoma cultures. We develop monoclonal antibodies against three epitope tags (FLAG-tag, S-tag, and V5-tag) and two F-actin crosslinking proteins (plastin and espin). Specific antibodies show fast dissociation with half-lives ranging from 0.98 to 2.2 s. Unexpectedly, fast-dissociating yet specific antibodies are not so rare. A combination of fluorescently labeled Fab probes synthesized from these antibodies and light-sheet microscopy, such as dual-view inverted selective plane illumination microscopy (diSPIM), reveal rapid turnover of espin within long-lived F-actin cores of inner-ear sensory hair cell stereocilia, demonstrating that fast-dissociating specific antibodies can identify novel biological phenomena.

Abstract: Summary
Acquisition of resistance to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT-targeted monotherapy implies the existence of common resistance mechanisms independent of cancer type. Here, we demonstrate that PI3K/AKT inhibitors cause glycolytic crisis, acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) shortage, and a global decrease in histone acetylation. In addition, PI3K/AKT inhibitors induce drug resistance by selectively augmenting histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and binding of CBP/p300 and BRD4 proteins at a subset of growth factor and receptor (GF/R) gene loci. BRD4 occupation at these loci and drug-resistant cell growth are vulnerable to both bromodomain and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Little or no occupation of HDAC proteins at the GF/R gene loci underscores the paradox that cells respond equivalently to the two classes of inhibitors with opposite modes of action. Targeting this unique acetyl-histone-related vulnerability offers two clinically viable strategies to overcome PI3K/AKT inhibitor resistance in different cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells use actin-based membrane protrusions, invadopodia, to degrade stroma and invade. In serous ovarian cancer (SOC), the endothelin A receptor (ETAR) drives invadopodia by a not fully explored coordinated function of β-arrestin1 (β-arr1). Here, we report that β-arr1 links the integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/βPIX complex to activate Rac3 GTPase, acting as a central node in the adhesion-based extracellular matrix (ECM) sensing and degradation. Downstream, Rac3 phosphorylates PAK1 and cofilin and promotes invadopodium-dependent ECM proteolysis and invasion. Furthermore, ETAR/ILK/Rac3 signaling supports the communication between cancer and mesothelial cells, favoring SOC cell adhesion and transmigration. In vivo, ambrisentan, an ETAR antagonist, inhibits the adhesion and spreading of tumor cells to intraperitoneal organs, and invadopodium marker expression. As prognostic factors, high EDNRA/ILK expression correlates with poor SOC clinical outcome. These findings provide a framework for the ET-1R/β-arr1 pathway as an integrator of ILK/Rac3-dependent adhesive and proteolytic signaling to invadopodia, favoring cancer/stroma interactions and metastatic behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Extrachromosomal, circular DNA (ecDNA) is emerging as a prevalent yet less characterized oncogenic alteration in cancer genomes. We leverage ChIA-PET and ChIA-Drop chromatin interaction assays to characterize genome-wide ecDNA-mediated chromatin contacts that impact transcriptional programs in cancers. ecDNAs in glioblastoma patient-derived neurosphere and prostate cancer cell cultures are marked by widespread intra-ecDNA and genome-wide chromosomal interactions. ecDNA-chromatin contact foci are characterized by broad and high-level H3K27ac signals converging predominantly on chromosomal genes of increased expression levels. Prostate cancer cells harboring synthetic ecDNA circles composed of characterized enhancers result in the genome-wide activation of chromosomal gene transcription. Deciphering the chromosomal targets of ecDNAs at single-molecule resolution reveals an association with actively expressed oncogenes spatially clustered within ecDNA-directed interaction networks. Our results suggest that ecDNA can function as mobile transcriptional enhancers to promote tumor progression and manifest a potential synthetic aneuploidy mechanism of transcription control in cancer.

Abstract: Redox-sensitivity is a common property of several transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. Oxidants and UVA-light activate TRPV2 by oxidizing methionine pore residues which are conserved in the capsaicin-receptor TRPV1. However, the redox-sensitivity of TRPV1 is regarded to depend on intracellular cysteine residues. In this study we examined if TRPV1 is gated by UVA-light, and if the conserved methionine residues are relevant for redox-sensitivity of TRPV1. Patch clamp recordings were performed to explore wildtype (WT) and mutants of human TRPV1 (hTRPV1). UVA-light induced hTRPV1-mediated membrane currents and potentiated both proton- and heat-evoked currents. The reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) prevented and partially reversed UVA-light induced sensitization of hTRPV1. UVA-light induced sensitization was reduced in the mutant hTRPV1-C158A/C387S/C767S (hTRPV1-3C). The remaining sensitivity to UVA-light of hTRRPV1-3C was not further reduced upon exchange of the methionine residues M568 and M645. While UVA-induced sensitization was reduced in the protein kinase C-insensitive mutant hTRPV1-S502A/S801A, the PKC-inhibitors chelerythrine chloride, staurosporine and Gö6976 did not reduce UVA-induced effects on hTRPV1-WT. While hTRPV1-3C was insensitive to the cysteine-selective oxidant diamide, it displayed a residual sensitivity to H2O2 and chloramine-T. However, the exchange of M568 and M645 in hTRPV1-3C did not further reduce these effects. Our data demonstrate that oxidants and UVA-light gate hTRPV1 by cysteine-dependent as well as cysteine-independent mechanisms. In contrast to TRPV2, the methionine residues 568 and 645 seem to be of limited relevance for redox-sensitivity of hTRPV1. Finally, UVA-light induced gating of hTRPV1 does not seem to require activation of protein kinase C.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells, like microbes, live in complex metabolic environments. Recent evidence suggests that microbial behavior across metabolic environments is well described by simple empirical growth relationships, or growth laws. Do such empirical growth relationships also exist in cancer cells? To test this question, we develop a high-throughput approach to extract quantitative measurements of cancer cell behaviors in systematically altered metabolic environments. Using this approach, we examine relationships between growth and three frequently studied cancer phenotypes: drug-treatment survival, cell migration, and lactate overflow. Drug-treatment survival follows simple linear growth relationships, which differ quantitatively between chemotherapeutics and EGFR inhibition. Cell migration follows a weak grow-and-go growth relationship, with substantial deviation in some environments. Finally, lactate overflow is mostly decoupled from growth rate and is instead determined by the cells’ ability to maintain high sugar uptake rates. Altogether, this work provides a quantitative approach for formulating empirical growth laws of cancer.

Abstract: Carbon catabolite repression enables fungi to utilize the most favourable carbon source in the environment, and is mediated by a key regulator, CreA, in most fungi. CreA-mediated regulation has mainly been studied at high monosaccharide concentrations, an uncommon situation in most natural biotopes. In nature, many fungi rely on plant biomass as their major carbon source by producing enzymes to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides into metabolizable sugars. To determine the role of CreA when fungi grow in more natural conditions and in particular with respect to degradation and conversion of plant cell walls, we compared transcriptomes of a creA deletion and reference strain of the ascomycete Aspergillus niger during growth on sugar beet pulp and wheat bran. Transcriptomics, extracellular sugar concentrations and growth profiling of A. niger on a variety of carbon sources, revealed that also under conditions with low concentrations of free monosaccharides, CreA has a major effect on gene expression in a strong time and substrate composition dependent manner. In addition, we compared the CreA regulon from five fungi during their growth on crude plant biomass or cellulose. It showed that CreA commonly regulated genes related to carbon metabolism, sugar transport and plant cell wall degrading enzymes across different species. We therefore conclude that CreA has a crucial role for fungi also in adapting to low sugar concentrations as occurring in their natural biotopes, which is supported by the presence of CreA orthologs in nearly all fungi.

Abstract: Ubiquitin proteasome sytem (UPS) and autophagy govern protein quality control by degradation and clearance of damaged proteins. Many proteins working in these pathways such as p97/VCP, Ubiquitin (Ub), Jab1/CSN5, p62, LC3B and Beclin 1 are known to be essential for different pathological conditions, especially in cancer, but their expression in human testicular tumors has not been characterized yet. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression of UPS (p97/VCP, Ubiquitin, Jab1/CSN5) and autophagic (p62, LC3B, Beclin 1) proteins in human testicular tumors and cancer adjacent normal testicular tissues. We used an immunohistochemical staining technique. 120 cases of testicular germ and non-germ cell tumors, which are 42 seminomas, 31 embryonal carcinomas, 11 yolk sac tumors, 25 intratubular germ cell neoplasms, 6 Leydig cell tumors, 5 Sertoli cell tumors, were collected and evaluated on tissue microarray. For the first time, the expression of p97/VCP, Ub, Jab1/CSN5, p62, LC3B and Beclin 1 in different type of human testicular tumors has been confirmed. We found that p97/VCP, Ub and Jab1/CSN5 were frequently expressed at higher levels in testicular tumours. In contrast to UPS markers, p62, LC3B and Beclin 1 showed significantly diminished expressions in testicular tumors. Accordingly, a negative correlation between p97/VCP and autophagic markers (p62 and LC3B) was found, suggesting a relationship between UPS and autophagy in different type of testicular tumors. The current results displayed elevated level of p97/VCP, Ub and Jab1/CSN5 expressions in contrast to the diminished expression of p62, LC3B and Beclin 1 in human testicular tumors, thereby supporting a correlation between p97/VCP and autophagic markers in testicular tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Organismal development and cell differentiation critically depend on chromatin state transitions. However, certain developmentally regulated genes lack histone 3 lysine 9 and 27 acetylation (H3K9ac and H3K27ac, respectively) and histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, histone modifications common to most active genes. Here we describe a chromatin state featuring unique histone 3 lysine 14 acetylation (H3K14ac) peaks in key tissue-specific genes in Drosophila and human cells. Replacing H3K14 in Drosophila demonstrates that H3K14 is essential for expression of genes devoid of canonical histone modifications in the embryonic gut and larval wing imaginal disc, causing lethality and defective wing patterning. We find that the SWI/SNF protein Brahma (Brm) recognizes H3K14ac, that brm acts in the same genetic pathway as H3K14R, and that chromatin accessibility at H3K14ac-unique genes is decreased in H3K14R mutants. Our results show that acetylation of a single lysine is essential at genes devoid of canonical histone marks and uncover an important requirement for H3K14 in tissue-specific gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial sheets undergo highly reproducible remodeling to shape organs. This stereotyped morphogenesis depends on a well-defined sequence of events leading to the regionalized expression of developmental patterning genes that finally triggers downstream mechanical forces to drive tissue remodeling at a pre-defined position. However, how tissue mechanics controls morphogenetic robustness when challenged by intrinsic perturbations in close proximity has never been addressed. Using Drosophila developing leg, we show that a bias in force propagation ensures stereotyped morphogenesis despite the presence of mechanical noise in the environment. We found that knockdown of the Arp2/3 complex member Arpc5 specifically affects fold directionality while altering neither the developmental nor the force generation patterns. By combining in silico modeling, biophysical tools, and ad hoc genetic tools, our data reveal that junctional myosin II planar polarity favors long-range force channeling and ensures folding robustness, avoiding force scattering and thus isolating the fold domain from surrounding mechanical perturbations.

Abstract: Summary
Thermogenic beige fat found in white adipose tissue is a potential therapeutic target to curb the global obesity and diabetes epidemic. However, these inducible thermogenic beige adipocytes have been thought to be short-lived and to rapidly convert to “white-like” adipocytes after discontinuing stimuli. In this study, using effective labeling techniques and genetic mouse tools, we demonstrate that a subset of UCP1+ cells that exist within white adipose tissue are able to self-divide and contribute to new beige adipocyte recruitment in response to β3 stimuli. When these cells are depleted or their adipogenic capability is blocked, β3-induced beige adipocyte formation is impaired. We also identify a cell-cycle machinery of p21 and CDKN2A as a molecular basis of beige adipocyte regulation. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of beige adipocyte regulation and potential therapeutic opportunities to induce the beige phenotype and treat metabolic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Ablation of Slc22a14 causes male infertility in mice, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that SLC22A14 is a riboflavin transporter localized at the inner mitochondrial membrane of the spermatozoa mid-piece and show by genetic, biochemical, multi-omic, and nutritional evidence that riboflavin transport deficiency suppresses the oxidative phosphorylation and reprograms spermatozoa energy metabolism by disrupting flavoenzyme functions. Specifically, we find that fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) is defective with significantly reduced levels of acyl-carnitines and metabolites from the TCA cycle (the citric acid cycle) but accumulated triglycerides and free fatty acids in Slc22a14 knockout spermatozoa. We demonstrate that Slc22a14-mediated FAO is essential for spermatozoa energy generation and motility. Furthermore, sperm from wild-type mice treated with a riboflavin-deficient diet mimics those in Slc22a14 knockout mice, confirming that an altered riboflavin level causes spermatozoa morphological and bioenergetic defects. Beyond substantially advancing our understanding of spermatozoa energy metabolism, our study provides an attractive target for the development of male contraceptives.

Abstract: Summary
Whisker deafferentation in mice disrupts topographic connectivity from the brainstem to the thalamic ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM), which represents whisker map, by recruiting “ectopic” axons carrying non-whisker information in VPM. However, mechanisms inducing this plasticity remain largely unknown. Here, we show the role of region-specific microglia in the brainstem principal trigeminal nucleus (Pr5), a whisker sensory-recipient region, in VPM whisker map plasticity. Systemic or local manipulation of microglial activity reveals that microglia in Pr5, but not in VPM, are necessary and sufficient for recruiting ectopic axons in VPM. Deafferentation causes membrane hyperexcitability of Pr5 neurons dependent on microglia. Inactivation of Pr5 neurons abolishes this somatotopic reorganization in VPM. Additionally, microglial depletion prevents deafferentation-induced ectopic mechanical hypersensitivity. Our results indicate that local microglia in the brainstem induce peripheral nerve injury-induced plasticity of map organization in the thalamus and suggest that microglia are potential therapeutic targets for peripheral nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
In multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurological diseases, the failure to repair demyelinated lesions contributes to axonal damage and clinical disability. Here, we provide evidence that Mertk, a gene highly expressed by microglia that alters MS risk, is required for efficient remyelination. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, Mertk-knockout (KO) mice show impaired clearance of myelin debris and remyelination following demyelination. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterize Mertk-influenced responses to cuprizone-mediated demyelination and remyelination across different cell types. Mertk-KO brains show an attenuated microglial response to demyelination but an elevated proportion of interferon (IFN)-responsive microglia. In addition, we identify a transcriptionally distinct subtype of surviving oligodendrocytes specific to demyelinated lesions. The inhibitory effect of myelin debris on remyelination is mediated in part by IFNγ, which further impedes microglial clearance of myelin debris and inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation. Together, our work establishes a role for Mertk in microglia activation, phagocytosis, and migration during remyelination.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer exhibits a strong bone tropism in metastasis. How the bone microenvironment (BME) impacts ER signaling and endocrine therapy remains poorly understood. Here, we discover that the osteogenic niche transiently and reversibly reduces ER expression and activities specifically in bone micrometastases (BMMs), leading to endocrine resistance. As BMMs progress, the ER reduction and endocrine resistance may partially recover in cancer cells away from the osteogenic niche, creating phenotypic heterogeneity in macrometastases. Using multiple approaches, including an evolving barcoding strategy, we demonstrated that this process is independent of clonal selection, and represents an EZH2-mediated epigenomic reprogramming. EZH2 drives ER+ BMMs toward a basal and stem-like state. EZH2 inhibition reverses endocrine resistance. These data exemplify how epigenomic adaptation to BME promotes phenotypic plasticity of metastatic seeds, fosters intra-metastatic heterogeneity, and alters therapeutic responses. Our study provides insights into the clinical enigma of ER+ metastatic recurrences despite endocrine therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin dysregulation has emerged as an important mechanism of oncogenesis. To develop targeted treatments, it is important to understand the transcriptomic consequences of mutations in chromatin modifier genes. Recently, mutations in the histone methyltransferase gene nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 1 (NSD1) have been identified in a subset of common and deadly head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Here, we use genome-wide approaches and genome editing to dissect the downstream effects of loss of NSD1 in HNSCC. We demonstrate that NSD1 mutations are responsible for loss of intergenic H3K36me2 domains, followed by loss of DNA methylation and gain of H3K27me3 in the affected genomic regions. In addition, those regions are enriched in cis-regulatory elements, and subsequent loss of H3K27ac correlates with reduced expression of their target genes. Our analysis identifies genes and pathways affected by the loss of NSD1 and paves the way to further understanding the interplay among chromatin modifications in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
A major pathway for proinflammatory protein release by macrophages is inflammasome-mediated pyroptotic cell death. As conventional secretion, unconventional secretion, and cell death are executed simultaneously, however, the cellular mechanisms regulating this complex paracrine program remain incompletely understood. Here, we devise a quantitative proteomics strategy to define the cellular exit route for each protein by pharmacological and genetic dissection of cellular checkpoints regulating protein release. We report the release of hundreds of proteins during pyroptosis, predominantly due to cell lysis. They comprise constitutively expressed and transcriptionally induced proteins derived from the cytoplasm and specific intracellular organelles. Many low-molecular-weight proteins including the cytokine interleukin-1β, alarmins, and lysosomal-cargo proteins exit cells in the absence of cell lysis. Cytokines and alarmins are released in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi-dependent manner as free proteins rather than by extracellular vesicles. Our work provides an experimental framework for the dissection of cellular exit pathways and a resource for pyroptotic protein release.

Abstract: MicroRNAs are important regulators in stem cells, which involve in gene regulation, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. As an important one, miR-34c participates in various processes by targeting protein-coding genes. It is generally considered as a tumor suppressor and cell adhesion inhibitor. However, whether miR-34c has effects on pluripotent stem cells is not clear. Here, by mir-34c mimics transfection, the function of miR-34c on porcine induced pluripotent stem cell (piPSC)-like cells was investigated. Bioinformatics analyses showed that c-Myc is miR-34c's candidate target, which was confirmed by dual Luciferase assay. The knockout of miR-34c indicated that mir-34c affects the proliferation and pluripotency of piPSC-like cells by targeting c-Myc. Our study explored the regulatory mechanism of miR-34c on piPSC-like cells, providing a reference for the establishment of true porcine PSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Pioneering studies from the early 1980s suggested that bacterial peptidoglycan-derived muramyl peptides (MPs) could exert either stimulatory or immunosuppressive functions depending, in part, on chronicity of exposure. However, this Janus-faced property of MPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the immunosuppressive potential of Nod1, the bacterial sensor of diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-containing MPs. Using a model of self-limiting peritonitis, we show that systemic Nod1 activation promotes an autophagy-dependent reprogramming of macrophages toward an alternative phenotype. Moreover, Nod1 stimulation induces the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and maintains their immunosuppressive potential via arginase-1 activity. Supporting the role of MDSCs and tumor-associated macrophages in cancer, we demonstrate that myeloid-intrinsic Nod1 expression sustains intra-tumoral arginase-1 levels to foster an immunosuppressive and tumor-permissive microenvironment during colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Our findings support the notion that bacterial products, via Nod1 detection, modulate the immunosuppressive activity of myeloid cells and fuel tumor progression in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor and stromal interactions consist of reciprocal signaling through cytokines, growth factors, direct cell-cell interactions, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Small EVs (≤200 nm) have been considered critical messengers of cellular communication during tumor development. Here, we demonstrate that gain-of-function (GOF) p53 protein can be packaged into small EVs and transferred to fibroblasts. GOF p53 protein is selectively bound by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a chaperone protein, and packaged into small EVs. Inhibition of HSP90 activity blocks packaging of GOF, but not wild-type, p53 in small EVs. GOF p53-containing small EVs result in their conversion to cancer-associated fibroblasts. In vivo studies reveal that GOF p53-containing small EVs can enhance tumor growth and promote fibroblast transformation into a cancer-associated phenotype. These findings provide a better understanding of the complex interactions between cancer and stromal cells and may have therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
Precise control of CRISPR-Cas9 would improve its safety and applicability. Controlled CRISPR inhibition is a promising approach but is complicated by separate inhibitor delivery, incomplete deactivation, and slow kinetics. To overcome these obstacles, we engineered photocleavable guide RNAs (pcRNAs) that endow Cas9 nucleases and base editors with a built-in mechanism for light-based deactivation. pcRNA enabled the fastest (<1 min) and most complete (<1% residual indels) approach for Cas9 deactivation. It also exhibited significantly enhanced specificity with wild-type Cas9. Time-resolved deactivation revealed that 12–36 h of Cas9 activity or 2–4 h of base editor activity was sufficient to achieve high editing efficiency. pcRNA is useful for studies of the cellular response to DNA damage by abolishing sustained cycles of damage and repair that would otherwise desynchronize response trajectories. Together, pcRNA expands the CRISPR toolbox for precision genome editing and studies of DNA damage and repair.

Abstract: Summary
At implantation, the embryo establishes contacts with the maternal endometrium. This stage is associated with a high incidence of preclinical pregnancy losses. While the maternal factors underlying uterine receptivity have been investigated, the signals required by the embryo for successful peri-implantation development remain elusive. To explore these, we studied integrin β1 signaling, as embryos deficient for this receptor degenerate at implantation. We demonstrate that the coordinated action of pro-survival signals and localized actomyosin suppression via integrin β1 permits the development of the embryo beyond implantation. Failure of either process leads to developmental arrest and apoptosis. Pharmacological stimulation through fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), coupled with ROCK-mediated actomyosin inhibition, rescues the deficiency of integrin β1, promoting progression to post-implantation stages. Mutual exclusion between integrin β1 and actomyosin seems to be conserved in the human embryo, suggesting the possibility that these mechanisms could also underlie the transition of the human epiblast from pre- to post-implantation.

Abstract: Summary
The MYC oncoprotein globally affects the function of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The ability of MYC to promote transcription elongation depends on its ubiquitylation. Here, we show that MYC and PAF1c (polymerase II-associated factor 1 complex) interact directly and mutually enhance each other’s association with active promoters. PAF1c is rapidly transferred from MYC onto RNAPII. This transfer is driven by the HUWE1 ubiquitin ligase and is required for MYC-dependent transcription elongation. MYC and HUWE1 promote histone H2B ubiquitylation, which alters chromatin structure both for transcription elongation and double-strand break repair. Consistently, MYC suppresses double-strand break accumulation in active genes in a strictly PAF1c-dependent manner. Depletion of PAF1c causes transcription-dependent accumulation of double-strand breaks, despite widespread repair-associated DNA synthesis. Our data show that the transfer of PAF1c from MYC onto RNAPII efficiently couples transcription elongation with double-strand break repair to maintain the genomic integrity of MYC-driven tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
O-linked β-N-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is attached to proteins under glucose-replete conditions; this posttranslational modification results in molecular and physiological changes that affect cell fate. Here we show that posttranslational modification of serine/arginine-rich protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) by O-GlcNAc regulates de novo lipogenesis by regulating pre-mRNA splicing. We found that O-GlcNAc transferase O-GlcNAcylated SRPK2 at a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which triggers binding of SRPK2 to importin α. Consequently, O-GlcNAcylated SRPK2 was imported into the nucleus, where it phosphorylated serine/arginine-rich proteins and promoted splicing of lipogenic pre-mRNAs. We determined that protein nuclear import by O-GlcNAcylation-dependent binding of cargo protein to importin α might be a general mechanism in cells. This work reveals a role of O-GlcNAc in posttranscriptional regulation of de novo lipogenesis, and our findings indicate that importin α is a “reader” of an O-GlcNAcylated NLS.

Abstract: Summary
The chromatin-associated protein WDR5 is a promising pharmacological target in cancer, with most drug discovery efforts directed against an arginine-binding cavity in WDR5 called the WIN site. Despite a clear expectation that WIN site inhibitors will alter the repertoire of WDR5 interaction partners, their impact on the WDR5 interactome remains unknown. Here, we use quantitative proteomics to delineate how the WDR5 interactome is changed by WIN site inhibition. We show that the WIN site inhibitor alters the interaction of WDR5 with dozens of proteins, including those linked to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that the master kinase PDPK1 is a bona fide high-affinity WIN site binding protein that engages WDR5 to modulate transcription of genes expressed in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. This dataset expands our understanding of WDR5 and serves as a resource for deciphering the action of WIN site inhibitors.

Abstract: Although microplastics (MPs) have received increasing focus and currently have become an emerging area of research, there is limited knowledge about their effect on whole body histology of fish. In this study, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) early juveniles were exposed to 1, 10, or 100 mg/L of MPs for 15 days and 15 days post-exposure, after which whole body histological examinations were performed. Histological analysis of kidney revealed congestion of blood capillaries, inflammatory cells, loss of basophilic cytoplasm in several tubules, vacuolated tubules, shrinking of convoluted tubules, widening of intertubular space, complete deformation, glomerular atrophy, vacuolated glomerular cells, and signs of fatty tubules. The liver tissue exhibited vacuoles, hydropic degeneration, necrotic area, severe deformation of hepatocytes, pyknotic nuclei, and dilation and congestion of blood sinusoids. The pancreatic tissue revealed shrunken and degenerated acini with pyknotic nuclei, hemorrhage, necrotic area, inflammatory cells, fatty cells, and congested blood capillaries. In the muscle tissue, fiber core dissociation, edema, necrosis, segmented fibers, and inflammatory cells were detected. The gill tissue demonstrated dilation and congestion of blood vessels, complete lamellar fusions, lifting of epithelium, shortening and degeneration of secondary lamellae, hyperplasia, and deposition of MPs between primary lamellae. In the spinal cord and notochord, the effects were degeneration and protrusion of meninges, deformation and deviation of notochord from its central axis, edema, degeneration of notochord (disappearance of vacuolar cells), deviation of spinal cord from the central axis, and loss of vacuolar cells in notochord. The intestinal tissue exhibited degeneration of basement membrane, inflammatory cells, goblet cells, atrophy of submucosa, pyknotic nuclei, hemorrhage, and vacuolization of mucosal cells. The histopathological changes in different organs were noticed even post-exposure in fish exposed to MPs compared to those in control fish and these changes were concentration dependent. In conclusion, these data together with our previous data suggest that MPs can cause different changes, ranging from biochemical alterations in single cells to lesions in the entire tissue, which can affect the vitality and life of fish.

Abstract: Summary
Glycans are one of the fundamental classes of macromolecules and are involved in a broad range of biological phenomena. A large variety of glycan structures can be synthesized depending on tissue or cell types and environmental changes. Here, we developed a comprehensive glycosylation mapping tool, termed GlycoMaple, to visualize and estimate glycan structures based on gene expression. We informatically selected 950 genes involved in glycosylation and its regulation. Expression profiles of these genes were mapped onto global glycan metabolic pathways to predict glycan structures, which were confirmed using glycomic analyses. Based on the predictions of N-glycan processing, we constructed 40 knockout HEK293 cell lines and analyzed the effects of gene knockout on glycan structures. Finally, the glycan structures of 64 cell lines, 37 tissues, and primary colon tumor tissues were estimated and compared using publicly available databases. Our systematic approach can accelerate glycan analyses and engineering in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
Uncertainty exists as to whether the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) should be activated or inhibited for the treatment of obesity. Gipr was recently demonstrated in hypothalamic feeding centers, but the physiological relevance of CNS Gipr remains unknown. Here we show that HFD-fed CNS-Gipr KO mice and humanized (h)GIPR knockin mice with CNS-hGIPR deletion show decreased body weight and improved glucose metabolism. In DIO mice, acute central and peripheral administration of acyl-GIP increases cFos neuronal activity in hypothalamic feeding centers, and this coincides with decreased body weight and food intake and improved glucose handling. Chronic central and peripheral administration of acyl-GIP lowers body weight and food intake in wild-type mice, but shows blunted/absent efficacy in CNS-Gipr KO mice. Also, the superior metabolic effect of GLP-1/GIP co-agonism relative to GLP-1 is extinguished in CNS-Gipr KO mice. Our data hence establish a key role of CNS Gipr for control of energy metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase causes cerebellum-specific neurodegeneration in humans. We previously demonstrated that deficiency in ATM activation via oxidative stress generates insoluble protein aggregates in human cells, reminiscent of protein dysfunction in common neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we show that this process is driven by poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) and that the insoluble protein species arise from intrinsically disordered proteins associating with PAR-associated genomic sites in ATM-deficient cells. The lesions implicated in this process are single-strand DNA breaks dependent on reactive oxygen species, transcription, and R-loops. Human cells expressing Mre11 A-T-like disorder mutants also show PARP-dependent aggregation identical to ATM deficiency. Lastly, analysis of A-T patient cerebellum samples shows widespread protein aggregation as well as loss of proteins known to be critical in human spinocerebellar ataxias that is not observed in neocortex tissues. These results provide a hypothesis accounting for loss of protein integrity and cerebellum function in A-T.

Abstract: Summary
The signal transduction by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is mediated by heterotrimeric G proteins composed from one of the 16 Gα subunits and the inseparable Gβγ complex assembled from a repertoire of 5 Gβ and 12 Gγ subunits. However, the functional role of compositional diversity in Gβγ complexes has been elusive. Using optical biosensors, we examined the function of all Gβγ combinations in living cells and uncovered two major roles of Gβγ diversity. First, we demonstrate that the identity of Gβγ subunits greatly influences the kinetics and efficacy of GPCR responses at the plasma membrane. Second, we show that different Gβγ combinations are selectively dispatched from the plasma membrane to various cellular organelles on a timescale from milliseconds to minutes. We describe the mechanisms regulating these processes and document their implications for GPCR signaling via various Gα subunits, thereby illustrating a role for the compositional diversity of G protein heterotrimers.

Abstract: Summary
Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is a life-threatening salivary gland cancer that is driven primarily by a transcriptional coactivator fusion composed of cyclic AMP-regulated transcriptional coactivator 1 (CRTC1) and mastermind-like 2 (MAML2). The mechanisms by which the chimeric CRTC1/MAML2 (C1/M2) oncoprotein rewires gene expression programs that promote tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we show that C1/M2 induces transcriptional activation of the non-canonical peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) splice variant PGC-1α4, which regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-mediated insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) expression. This mitogenic transcriptional circuitry is consistent across cell lines and primary tumors. C1/M2-positive tumors exhibit IGF-1 pathway activation, and small-molecule drug screens reveal that tumor cells harboring the fusion gene are selectively sensitive to IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibition. Furthermore, this dependence on autocrine regulation of IGF-1 transcription renders MEC cells susceptible to PPARγ inhibition with inverse agonists. These results yield insights into the aberrant coregulatory functions of C1/M2 and identify a specific vulnerability that can be exploited for precision therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted protein degradation is an emerging therapeutic paradigm. Small-molecule degraders such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) induce the degradation of neo-substrates by hijacking E3 ubiquitin ligases. Although ubiquitylation of endogenous substrates has been extensively studied, the mechanism underlying forced degradation of neo-substrates is less well understood. We found that the ubiquitin ligase TRIP12 promotes PROTAC-induced and CRL2VHL-mediated degradation of BRD4 but is dispensable for the degradation of the endogenous CRL2VHL substrate HIF-1α. TRIP12 associates with BRD4 via CRL2VHL and specifically assembles K29-linked ubiquitin chains, facilitating the formation of K29/K48-branched ubiquitin chains and accelerating the assembly of K48 linkage by CRL2VHL. Consequently, TRIP12 promotes the PROTAC-induced apoptotic response. TRIP12 also supports the efficiency of other degraders that target CRABP2 or TRIM24 or recruit CRBN. These observations define TRIP12 and K29/K48-branched ubiquitin chains as accelerators of PROTAC-directed targeted protein degradation, revealing a cooperative mechanism of branched ubiquitin chain assembly unique to the degradation of neo-substrates.

Abstract: Summary
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) are imprinting disorders manifesting as aberrant fetal growth and severe postnatal-growth-related complications. Based on the insulator model, one-third of BWS cases and two-thirds of SRS cases are consistent with misexpression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), an important facilitator of fetal growth. We propose that the IGF2-dependent BWS and SRS cases can be identified by prenatal diagnosis and can be prevented by prenatal intervention targeting IGF2. We test this hypothesis using our mouse models of IGF2-dependent BWS and SRS. We find that genetically normalizing IGF2 levels in a double rescue experiment corrects the fetal overgrowth phenotype in the BWS model and the growth retardation in the SRS model. In addition, we pharmacologically rescue the BWS growth phenotype by reducing IGF2 signaling during late gestation. This animal study encourages clinical investigations to target IGF2 for prenatal diagnosis and prenatal prevention in human BWS and SRS.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. One major obstacle to treatment is a lack of effective molecular-targeted therapies. In this study, we find that EphA2 expression and signaling are enriched in human HCC and associated with poor prognosis. Loss of EphA2 suppresses the initiation and growth of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, CRISPR/CAS9-mediated EphA2 inhibition significantly delays tumor development in a genetically engineered murine model of HCC. Mechanistically, we discover that targeting EphA2 suppresses both AKT and JAK1/STAT3 signaling, two separate oncogenic pathways in HCC. We also identify a small molecule kinase inhibitor of EphA2 that suppresses tumor progression in a murine HCC model. Together, our results suggest EphA2 as a promising therapeutic target for HCC.

Abstract: Summary
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensor that plays roles in multiple biological processes beyond metabolism. Several studies have suggested that AMPK is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR), but the mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that AMPK promotes classic non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) in double-strand break (DSB) repair through recruiting a key chromatin-based mediator named p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), which facilitates the end joining of distal DNA ends during DDR. We find that the interaction of AMPK and 53BP1 spatially occurs under DSB stress. In the context of DSBs, AMPK directly phosphorylates 53BP1 at Ser1317 and promotes 53BP1 recruitment during DDR for an efficient c-NHEJ, thus maintaining genomic stability and diversity of the immune repertoire. Taken together, our study demonstrates that AMPK is a regulator of 53BP1 and controls c-NHEJ choice by phospho-regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Passive transfer of convalescent plasma or serum is a time-honored strategy for treating infectious diseases. Human convalescent plasma containing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently being used to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 where clinical efficacy trials are ongoing. Here, we assess therapeutic passive transfer in groups of SARS-CoV-2-infected African green monkeys with convalescent sera containing either high or low anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers. Differences in viral load and pathology are minimal between monkeys that receive the lower titer convalescent sera and untreated controls. However, lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory compartments, reduced severity of virus-associated lung pathology, and reductions in coagulopathy and inflammatory processes are observed in monkeys that receive high titer sera versus untreated controls. Our data indicate that convalescent plasma therapy in humans may be an effective strategy provided that donor sera contain high anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers given in early stages of the disease.

Abstract: Summary
Mossy cells (MCs) are a unique group of excitatory neurons in the hippocampus, a brain region important for emotion, learning, and memory. Due to the lack of a reliable method to isolate MCs from other cell types, how MCs integrate neural information and convey it to their synaptic targets for engaging a specific function are still unknown. Here, we report that MCs control the efficacy of spatial memory retrieval by synapsing directly onto local somatostatin-expressing (SST) cells. MC-SST synaptic transmission undergoes long-term potentiation (LTP), requiring Gria2-lacking Ca2+-permeable anti-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor (Ca2+AR). A long noncoding RNA (Gria2I) is associated with Gria2 transcriptional repressors in SST cells. Silencing Gria2I induces Gria2 transcription, blocks LTP of MCs-SST synaptic transmission, and reduces the efficacy of memory retrieval. Thus, MCs directly and functionally innervate local SST neurons, and this innervation controls the efficacy of spatial memory retrieval by Gria2I inhibition of Gria2 transcription.

Abstract: The Notch signaling pathway is highly conserved and regulates various fundamental development events. Activation of Notch signaling relies on production of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which assembles a transcription factor complex to turn on down-stream targets expression. The mastermind (mam) gene encodes an essential co-activator that permits NICD activity in the cell nucleus. During a somatic mosaic screen in Drosophila, an uncharacterized gene l(2)S9998 is identified as a positive regulator of the Notch signaling pathway. Genetic analysis demonstrates that l(2)S9998 functions at the level of transcriptional activation of Notch targets in the signal receiving cells. Whole genome sequencing reveals that l(2)S9998 is a novel allele of the mam gene, which is further confirmed by complementation tests. Along with three molecularly defined transposon insertions isolated from the screen, four mutants of mam are shown to modulate Notch signaling during fly wing development. Our analysis provides additional genetic resources for understanding mam function and Notch signaling regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Thermoneutral conditions typical for standard human living environments result in brown adipose tissue (BAT) involution, characterized by decreased mitochondrial mass and increased lipid deposition. Low BAT activity is associated with poor metabolic health, and BAT reactivation may confer therapeutic potential. However, the molecular drivers of this BAT adaptive process in response to thermoneutrality remain enigmatic. Using metabolic and lipidomic approaches, we show that endogenous fatty acid synthesis, regulated by carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP), is the central regulator of BAT involution. By transcriptional control of lipogenesis-related enzymes, ChREBP determines the abundance and composition of both storage and membrane lipids known to regulate organelle turnover and function. Notably, ChREBP deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of lipogenesis during thermoneutral adaptation preserved mitochondrial mass and thermogenic capacity of BAT independently of mitochondrial biogenesis. In conclusion, we establish lipogenesis as a potential therapeutic target to prevent loss of BAT thermogenic capacity as seen in adult humans.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular pathogens alter their host cells' mechanics to promote dissemination through tissues. Conversely, host cells may respond to the presence of pathogens by altering their mechanics to limit infection. Here, we monitored epithelial cell monolayers infected with intracellular bacterial pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes or Rickettsia parkeri, over days. Under conditions in which these pathogens trigger innate immune signaling through NF-κB and use actin-based motility to spread non-lytically intercellularly, we found that infected cell domains formed three-dimensional mounds. These mounds resulted from uninfected cells moving toward the infection site, collectively squeezing the softer and less contractile infected cells upward and ejecting them from the monolayer. Bacteria in mounds were less able to spread laterally in the monolayer, limiting the growth of the infection focus, while extruded infected cells underwent cell death. Thus, the coordinated forceful action of uninfected cells actively eliminates large domains of infected cells, consistent with this collective cell response representing an innate immunity-driven process.

Abstract: Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 critically controls cell death by neutralizing pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family members at the mitochondria. Bcl-2 proteins also act at the endoplasmic reticulum, the main intracellular Ca2+-storage organelle, where they inhibit IP3 receptors (IP3R) and prevent pro-apoptotic Ca2+-signaling events. IP3R channels are targeted by the BH4 domain of Bcl-2. Some cancer types rely on the IP3R-Bcl-2 interaction for survival. We previously developed a cell-permeable, BH4-domain-targeting peptide that can abrogate Bcl-2′s inhibitory action on IP3Rs, named Bcl-2 IP3 receptor disrupter-2 (BIRD-2). This peptide kills several Bcl-2-dependent cancer cell types, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells, by eliciting intracellular Ca2+ signalling. However, the exact mechanisms by which these excessive Ca2+ signals triggered by BIRD-2 provoke cancer cell death remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate in DLBCL that although BIRD-2 activates caspase 3/7 and provokes cell death in a caspase-dependent manner, the cell death is independent of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family members, Bim, Bax and Bak. Instead, BIRD-2 provokes mitochondrial Ca2+ overload that is rapidly followed by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Inhibiting mitochondrial Ca2+ overload using Ru265, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complex counteracts BIRD-2-induced cancer cell death. Finally, we validated our findings in primary CLL patient samples where BIRD-2 provoked mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and Ru265 counteracted BIRD-2-induced cell death. Overall, this work reveals the mechanisms by which BIRD-2 provokes cell death, which occurs via mitochondrial Ca2+ overload but acts independently of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family members.

Abstract: Summary
Measurements of cellular tRNA abundance are hampered by pervasive blocks to cDNA synthesis at modified nucleosides and the extensive similarity among tRNA genes. We overcome these limitations with modification-induced misincorporation tRNA sequencing (mim-tRNAseq), which combines a workflow for full-length cDNA library construction from endogenously modified tRNA with a comprehensive and user-friendly computational analysis toolkit. Our method accurately captures tRNA abundance and modification status in yeast, fly, and human cells and is applicable to any organism with a known genome. We applied mim-tRNAseq to discover a dramatic heterogeneity of tRNA isodecoder pools among diverse human cell lines and a surprising interdependence of modifications at distinct sites within the same tRNA transcript.

Abstract: Rab35 is a small GTPase that regulates plasma membrane to early endosome vesicular trafficking and mediates actin remodeling to form actin-rich cellular structures. While the function of Rab35 in the cellular context has been examined, its role during development has not been well studied. In this study, we take advantage of the sea urchin's high fecundity, external fertilization, and transparent embryos to determine the function of Rab35 during development. We found that loss of function of Rab35 results in defects in skeletogenesis and gastrulation, which were rescued by co-injection of sea urchin Rab35. The loss of Rab35's function results in decreased endocytosis and impaired exocytosis, which may be important for skeletogenesis and gastrulation. Skeletal spicules of Rab35 knockdown embryos have reduced organized actin compared to the control, supporting the notion that Rab35 regulates actin dynamics. In addition, the skeletal and gastrulation defects induced by Rab35 knockdown were rescued by co-injection with Fascin, an actin-bundling protein, indicating that proper actin dynamics play a critical role for both skeletogenesis and gastrulation. Overall, results indicate that through its role in mediating vesicular trafficking and actin remodeling, Rab35 is an important regulator of embryonic structure formation in early development.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic and genome-wide association studies suggest a central role for microglia in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of microglia in mice, a key preclinical model, has shown mixed results regarding translatability to human studies. To address this, scRNA-seq of microglia from C57BL/6J (B6) and wild-derived strains (WSB/EiJ, CAST/EiJ, and PWK/PhJ) with and without APP/PS1 demonstrates that genetic diversity significantly alters features and dynamics of microglia in baseline neuroimmune functions and in response to amyloidosis. Results show significant variation in the abundance of microglial subtypes or states, including numbers of previously identified disease-associated and interferon-responding microglia, across the strains. For each subtype, significant differences in the expression of many genes are observed in wild-derived strains relative to B6, including 19 genes previously associated with human AD including Apoe, Trem2, and Sorl1. This resource is critical in the development of appropriately targeted therapeutics for AD and other neurological diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Although induction of ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death, has emerged as an anticancer strategy, the metabolic basis of ferroptotic death remains poorly elucidated. Here, we show that glucose determines the sensitivity of human pancreatic ductal carcinoma cells to ferroptosis induced by pharmacologically inhibiting system xc−. Mechanistically, SLC2A1-mediated glucose uptake promotes glycolysis and, thus, facilitates pyruvate oxidation, fuels the tricyclic acid cycle, and stimulates fatty acid synthesis, which finally facilitates lipid peroxidation-dependent ferroptotic death. Screening of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) library targeting metabolic enzymes leads to identification of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) as the top gene responsible for ferroptosis resistance. PDK4 inhibits ferroptosis by blocking pyruvate dehydrogenase-dependent pyruvate oxidation. Inhibiting PDK4 enhances the anticancer activity of system xc− inhibitors in vitro and in suitable preclinical mouse models (e.g., a high-fat diet diabetes model). These findings reveal metabolic reprogramming as a potential target for overcoming ferroptosis resistance.

Abstract: Summary
CHD8 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8) is a chromatin remodeler associated with autism spectrum disorders. Homozygous Chd8 deletion in mice leads to embryonic lethality, making it difficult to assess whether CHD8 regulates brain development and whether CHD8 haploinsufficiency-related macrocephaly reflects normal CHD8 functions. Here, we report that homozygous conditional knockout of Chd8 restricted to neocortical glutamatergic neurons causes apoptosis-dependent near-complete elimination of neocortical structures. These mice, however, display normal survival and hyperactivity, anxiolytic-like behavior, and increased social interaction. They also show largely normal auditory function and moderately impaired visual and motor functions but enhanced whisker-related somatosensory function. These changes accompany thalamic hyperactivity, revealed by 15.2-Tesla fMRI, and increased intrinsic excitability and decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission in thalamic ventral posterior medial (VPM) neurons involved in somatosensation. These results suggest that excitatory neuronal CHD8 critically regulates neocortical development through anti-apoptotic mechanisms, neocortical elimination distinctly affects cognitive behaviors and sensory-motor functions in mice, and Chd8 haploinsufficiency-related macrocephaly might represent compensatory responses.

Abstract: Summary
Senescent cells trigger their own immune-mediated destruction, termed senescence surveillance. This is dependent on the inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which includes COX2, an enzyme with complex roles in cancer. The role COX2 plays during senescence surveillance is unknown. Here, we show that during RAS-induced senescence (RIS), COX2 is a critical regulator of SASP composition and senescence surveillance in vivo. COX2 regulates the expression of multiple inflammatory SASP components through an autocrine feedback loop involving its downstream product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), binding to EP4. During in vivo hepatocyte RIS, Cox2 is critical to tumor suppression, Cxcl1 expression, and immune-mediated senescence surveillance, partially through PGE2. Loss of Cox2 in RIS dysregulates the intrahepatic immune microenvironment, with enrichment of immunosuppressive immature myeloid cells and CD4+ regulatory T lymphocytes. Therefore, COX2 and PGE2 play a critical role in senescence, shaping SASP composition, promoting senescence surveillance and tumor suppression in the earliest stages of tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the central role of chromosomal context in gene transcription, human noncoding DNA variants are generally studied outside of their genomic location. This limits our understanding of disease-causing regulatory variants. INS promoter mutations cause recessive neonatal diabetes. We show that all INS promoter point mutations in 60 patients disrupt a CC dinucleotide, whereas none affect other elements important for episomal promoter function. To model CC mutations, we humanized an ∼3.1-kb region of the mouse Ins2 gene. This recapitulated developmental chromatin states and cell-specific transcription. A CC mutant allele, however, abrogated active chromatin formation during pancreas development. A search for transcription factors acting through this element revealed that another neonatal diabetes gene product, GLIS3, has a pioneer-like ability to derepress INS chromatin, which is hampered by the CC mutation. Our in vivo analysis, therefore, connects two human genetic defects in an essential mechanism for developmental activation of the INS gene.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by recurrent mutations in members of the gene regulatory and signaling machinery that control hematopoietic progenitor cell growth and differentiation. Here, we show that the transcription factor WT1 forms a major node in the rewired mutation-specific gene regulatory networks of multiple AML subtypes. WT1 is frequently either mutated or upregulated in AML, and its expression is predictive for relapse. The WT1 protein exists as multiple isoforms. For two main AML subtypes, we demonstrate that these isoforms exhibit differential patterns of binding and support contrasting biological activities, including enhanced proliferation. We also show that WT1 responds to oncogenic signaling and is part of a signaling-responsive transcription factor hub that controls AML growth. WT1 therefore plays a central and widespread role in AML biology.

Abstract: Summary
Hosts recognize cytosolic microbial infection via the nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor (NLR) protein family, triggering inflammasome complex assembly to provoke pyroptosis or cytokine-related caspase-1-dependent antimicrobial responses. Pathogens have evolved diverse strategies to antagonize inflammasome activation. Here, Edwardsiella piscicida gene-defined transposon library screening for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in nlrc4−/− bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) demonstrates that genes clustered in the bacterial arginine metabolism pathway participate in NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. Blocking arginine uptake or putrescine export significantly relieves NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, indicating that this bacterium rewires its arginine metabolism network during infection. Moreover, intracellular E. piscicida recruits the host arginine importer (mCAT-1) and putrescine exporter (Oct-2) to bacterium-containing vacuoles, accompanied by reduced arginine and accumulated cytosolic spermine. Neutralizing E. piscicida-induced cytosolic spermine enhancement by spermine synthetase or extracellular spermine significantly alters NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Importantly, accumulated cytosolic spermine inhibits K+ efflux-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These data highlight the mechanism of bacterial gene-mediated arginine metabolism control for NLRP3 inflammasome evasion.

Abstract: Astrocytes govern critical aspects of brain function via spontaneous calcium signals in their soma and processes. A significant proportion of these spontaneous astrocytic calcium events are associated with mitochondria, however, the extent, sources, or kinetics of astrocytic mitochondrial calcium influx have not been studied in the adult mouse brain. To measure calcium influx into astrocytic mitochondria in situ, we generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV) with the astrocyte-specific GfaABC1D promoter driving expression of the genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6f tagged to mito7, a mitochondrial matrix targeted signal sequence. Using this construct, we observed AAV-mediated expression of GCaMP6f in adult mouse astrocytic mitochondria that co-localized with MitoTracker deep red (MTDR) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and in the hippocampal stratum radiatum (HPC). Astrocytic mitochondria co-labeled with MTDR and GCaMP6f displayed robust, spontaneous calcium influx events in situ, with subcellular differences in calcium influx kinetics between somatic, branch, and branchlet mitochondria, and inter-regional differences between mitochondria in DLS and HPC astrocytes. Calcium influx into astrocytic mitochondria was strongly dependent on endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores, but did not require the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, MCU. Exposure to either glutamate, D1 or D2 dopamine receptor agonists increased calcium influx in some mitochondria, while simultaneously decreasing calcium influx in other mitochondria from the same astrocyte. These findings show that astrocytic mitochondria possess unique properties with regard to their subcellular morphology, mechanisms of calcium influx, and responses to neurotransmitter receptor agonists. Our results have important implications for understanding the role of astrocytic mitochondria during pathological processes.

Abstract: Summary
Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8) is an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor that is encoded by the most frequently mutated gene in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. CHD8 is expressed not only in neural tissues but also in many other organs; however, its functions are largely unknown. Here, we show that CHD8 is highly expressed in and maintains the stemness of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Conditional deletion of Chd8 specifically in mouse bone marrow induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and a differentiation block in HSCs in association with upregulation of the expression of p53 target genes. A colony formation assay and bone marrow transplantation reveal that CHD8 deficiency also compromises the stemness of HSCs. Furthermore, additional ablation of p53 rescues the impaired stem cell function and differentiation block of CHD8-deficient HSCs. Our results thus suggest that the CHD8-p53 axis plays a key role in regulation of the stemness and differentiation of HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial function declines during brain aging and is suspected to play a key role in age-induced cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Supplementing levels of spermidine, a body-endogenous metabolite, has been shown to promote mitochondrial respiration and delay aspects of brain aging. Spermidine serves as the amino-butyl group donor for the synthesis of hypusine (Nε-[4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl]-lysine) at a specific lysine residue of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). Here, we show that in the Drosophila brain, hypusinated eIF5A levels decline with age but can be boosted by dietary spermidine. Several genetic regimes of attenuating eIF5A hypusination all similarly affect brain mitochondrial respiration resembling age-typical mitochondrial decay and also provoke a premature aging of locomotion and memory formation in adult Drosophilae. eIF5A hypusination, conserved through all eukaryotes as an obviously critical effector of spermidine, might thus be an important diagnostic and therapeutic avenue in aspects of brain aging provoked by mitochondrial decline.

Abstract: Summary
Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are important for myelination and shuttling energy metabolites lactate and pyruvate toward axons through their expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1). Recent studies suggest that loss of OL MCT1 causes axonal degeneration. However, it is unknown how widespread and chronic loss of MCT1 in OLs specifically affects neuronal energy homeostasis with aging. To answer this, MCT1 conditional null mice were generated that allow for OL-specific MCT1 ablation. We observe that MCT1 loss from OL lineage cells is dispensable for normal myelination and axonal energy homeostasis early in life. By contrast, loss of OL lineage MCT1 expression with aging leads to significant axonal degeneration with concomitant hypomyelination. These data support the hypothesis that MCT1 is important for neuronal energy homeostasis in the aging central nervous system (CNS). The reduction in OL MCT1 that occurs with aging may enhance the risk for axonal degeneration and atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal obesity has been reported to be related to neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring. However, the underlying mechanisms and effective interventions remain unclear. This cross-sectional study with 778 children aged 7–14 years in China indicated that maternal obesity is strongly associated with children’s lower cognition and sociality. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that maternal obesity in mice disrupted the behavior and gut microbiome in offspring, both of which were restored by a high-fiber diet in either dams or offspring via alleviating synaptic impairments and microglial maturation defects. Co-housing and feces microbiota transplantation experiments revealed a causal relationship between microbiota and behavioral changes. Moreover, treatment with the microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids also alleviated the behavioral deficits in the offspring of obese dams. Together, our study indicated that the microbiota-metabolites-brain axis may underlie maternal obesity-induced cognitive and social dysfunctions and that high dietary fiber intake could be a promising intervention.

Abstract: Summary
The protein leverage hypothesis predicts that low dietary protein should increase energy intake and cause adiposity. We designed 10 diets varying from 1% to 20% protein combined with either 60% or 20% fat. Contrasting the expectation, very low protein did not cause increased food intake. Although these mice had activated hunger signaling, they ate less food, resulting in decreased body weight and improved glucose tolerance but not increased frailty, even under 60% fat. Moreover, they did not show hyperphagia when returned to a 20% protein diet, which could be mimicked by treatment with rapamycin. Intracerebroventricular injection of AAV-S6K1 significantly blunted the decrease in both food intake and body weight in mice fed 1% protein, an effect not observed with inhibition of eIF2a, TRPML1, and Fgf21 signaling. Hence, the 1% protein diet induced decreased food intake and body weight via a mechanism partially dependent on hypothalamic mTOR signaling.

Abstract: Valproic acid (VPA) is mainly prescribed to treat epilepsy. VPA has been reported to be associated with many adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity. Naringin (NRG) is a natural, therapeutically active flavanone glycoside with anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant. The current study was therefore designed to investigate the protective effect of NRG against the VPA-induced experimental hepatotoxicity model. For this purpose, 24 Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups as control (Vehicle), VPA (500 mg/kg), and NRG + VPA (100 mg/kg NRG + 500 mg/kg VPA) groups. The agents were administered via oral gavage for 14 days. Blood and liver tissue samples were taken on the end of the experiment. Biochemical analyzes were performed on the blood and liver samples. Also, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme, glutathione (GSH) content, catalase (CAT) enzyme levels were examined in the liver tissue samples. Histopathological changes (hydropic degeneration and congestion) in the VPA group were increased significantly when compared to the control group (p < 0.05). We also found a decrease in enzymes of serum liver function in the VPA group. However, NRG has been shown not to prevent histopathological changes in the VPA group. According to our results with this experiment protocol, NRG could not exert sufficient protection against VPA-induced hepatotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is mediated by multiple pathways. It is thought that the local chromatin context affects the pathway choice, but the underlying principles are poorly understood. Using a multiplexed reporter assay in combination with Cas9 cutting, we systematically measure the relative activities of three DSB repair pathways as a function of chromatin context in >1,000 genomic locations. This reveals that non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is broadly biased toward euchromatin, while the contribution of microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) is higher in specific heterochromatin contexts. In H3K27me3-marked heterochromatin, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 reverts the balance toward NHEJ. Single-stranded template repair (SSTR), often used for precise CRISPR editing, competes with MMEJ and is moderately linked to chromatin context. These results provide insight into the impact of chromatin on DSB repair pathway balance and guidance for the design of Cas9-mediated genome editing experiments.

Abstract: Summary
Renewing tissues have the remarkable ability to continually produce both proliferative progenitor and specialized differentiated cell types. How are complex milieus of microenvironmental signals interpreted to coordinate tissue-cell-type composition? Here, we investigate the responses of intestinal epithelium to individual and paired perturbations across eight epithelial signaling pathways. Using a high-throughput approach that combines enteroid monolayers and quantitative imaging, we identified conditions that enrich for specific cell types as well as interactions between pathways. Importantly, we found that modulation of transit-amplifying cell proliferation changes the ratio of differentiated secretory to absorptive cell types. These observations highlight an underappreciated role for transit-amplifying cells in the tuning of differentiated cell-type composition.

Abstract: Summary
Homology-directed repair (HDR) safeguards DNA integrity under various forms of stress, but how HDR protects replicating genomes under extensive metabolic alterations remains unclear. Here, we report that besides stalling replication forks, inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) triggers metabolic imbalance manifested by the accumulation of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cell nuclei. This leads to a redox-sensitive activation of the ATM kinase followed by phosphorylation of the MRE11 nuclease, which in HDR-deficient settings degrades stalled replication forks. Intriguingly, nascent DNA degradation by the ROS-ATM-MRE11 cascade is also triggered by hypoxia, which elevates signaling-competent ROS and attenuates functional HDR without arresting replication forks. Under these conditions, MRE11 degrades daughter-strand DNA gaps, which accumulate behind active replisomes and attract error-prone DNA polymerases to escalate mutation rates. Thus, HDR safeguards replicating genomes against metabolic assaults by restraining mutagenic repair at aberrantly processed nascent DNA. These findings have implications for cancer evolution and tumor therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The myeloid tumor suppressor KMT2C is recurrently deleted in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly therapy-related MDS/AML (t-MDS/t-AML), as part of larger chromosome 7 deletions. Here, we show that KMT2C deletions convey a selective advantage to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) after chemotherapy treatment that may precipitate t-MDS/t-AML. Kmt2c deletions markedly enhance murine HSC self-renewal capacity without altering proliferation rates. Haploid Kmt2c deletions convey a selective advantage only when HSCs are driven into cycle by a strong proliferative stimulus, such as chemotherapy. Cycling Kmt2c-deficient HSCs fail to differentiate appropriately, particularly in response to interleukin-1. Kmt2c deletions mitigate histone methylation/acetylation changes that accrue as HSCs cycle after chemotherapy, and they impair enhancer recruitment during HSC differentiation. These findings help explain why Kmt2c deletions are more common in t-MDS/t-AML than in de novo AML or clonal hematopoiesis: they selectively protect cycling HSCs from differentiation without inducing HSC proliferation themselves.

Abstract: Summary
Although T cell expansion depends on glycolysis, T effector cell differentiation requires signaling via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) regulates ROS by generating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), we examined how PPP blockade affects T cell differentiation and function. Here, we show that genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of the PPP enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) in the oxidative PPP results in the generation of superior CD8+ T effector cells. These cells have gene signatures and immunogenic markers of effector phenotype and show potent anti-tumor functions both in vitro and in vivo. In these cells, metabolic reprogramming occurs along with increased mitochondrial ROS and activated antioxidation machinery to balance ROS production against oxidative damage. Our findings reveal a role of 6PGD as a checkpoint for T cell effector differentiation/survival and evidence for 6PGD as an attractive metabolic target to improve tumor immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms controlling the post-natal maturation of astrocytes play a crucial role in ensuring correct synaptogenesis. We show that mitochondrial biogenesis in developing astrocytes is necessary for coordinating post-natal astrocyte maturation and synaptogenesis. The astrocytic mitochondrial biogenesis depends on the transient upregulation of metabolic regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), which is controlled by metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). At tissue level, the loss or downregulation of astrocytic PGC-1α sustains astrocyte proliferation, dampens astrocyte morphogenesis, and impairs the formation and function of neighboring synapses, whereas its genetic re-expression is sufficient to restore the mitochondria compartment and correct astroglial and synaptic defects. Our findings show that the developmental enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis in astrocytes is a critical mechanism controlling astrocyte maturation and supporting synaptogenesis, thus suggesting that astrocytic mitochondria may be a therapeutic target in the case of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders characterized by impaired synaptogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Forward genetic screens across hundreds of cancer cell lines have started to define the genetic dependencies of proliferating human cells and how these vary by genotype and lineage. Most screens, however, have been carried out in culture media that poorly reflect metabolite availability in human blood. Here, we performed CRISPR-based screens in traditional versus human plasma-like medium (HPLM). Sets of conditionally essential genes in human cancer cell lines span several cellular processes and vary with both natural cell-intrinsic diversity and the combination of basal and serum components that comprise typical media. Notably, we traced the causes for each of three conditional CRISPR phenotypes to the availability of metabolites uniquely defined in HPLM versus conventional media. Our findings reveal the profound impact of medium composition on gene essentiality in human cells, and also suggest general strategies for using genetic screens in HPLM to uncover new cancer vulnerabilities and gene-nutrient interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Administration of probiotics to regulate the immune system is a potential anti-tumor strategy. However, oral administration of probiotics is ineffective because of the poor inhabitation of exogenous bacteria in host intestines. Here we report that smectite, a type of mineral clay and established anti-diarrhea drug, promotes expansion of probiotics (especially Lactobacillus) in the murine gut and subsequently elicits anti-tumor immune responses. The ion-exchangeable microstructure of smectite preferentially promotes lactic acid bacteria (LABs) to form biofilms on smectite in vitro and in vivo. In mouse models, smectite laden with LAB biofilms (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) inhibits tumor growth (when used alone) and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy or immunotherapy (when used in combination with either of them) by activating dendritic cells (DCs) via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling. Our findings suggest oral administration of smectite as a promising strategy to enrich probiotics in vivo for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The evolutionarily conserved target-of-rapamycin (TOR) kinase coordinates cellular and organismal growth in all eukaryotes. Amino acids (AAs) are key upstream signals for mammalian TOR activation, but how nitrogen-related nutrients regulate TOR signaling in plants is poorly understood. Here, we discovered that, independent of nitrogen assimilation, nitrate and ammonium function as primary nitrogen signals to activate TOR in the Arabidopsis leaf primordium. We further identified that a total of 15 proteinogenic AAs are also able to activate TOR, and the first AAs generated from plant specific nitrogen assimilation (glutamine), sulfur assimilation (cysteine), and glycolate cycle (glycine), exhibit the highest potency. Interestingly, nitrate, ammonium, and glutamine all activate the small GTPase Rho-related protein from plants 2 (ROP2), and constitutively active ROP2 restores TOR activation under nitrogen-starvation conditions. Our findings suggest that specific evolutionary adaptations of the nitrogen-TOR signaling pathway occurred in plant lineages, and ROP2 can integrate diverse nitrogen and hormone signals for plant TOR activation.

Abstract: NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is tightly related to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and oridonin (Ori) has shown the potential to alleviate ischemia/reperfusion injury with underlying mechanisms. Our study aims to figure out whether Ori protects against the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. In this study, a temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion surgery was conducted on male C57BL/6 mice to mimic cerebral I/R injury in vivo. Cellular model of cerebral I/R in vitro was achieved by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reintroduction (OGD/R) in BV2 microglia cells. We found that Ori treatment significantly relieved the neurological deficits, neuronal injury and microglia activation in I/R mice according to morphological and histological analyses. Meanwhile, the inactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome was determined in Ori-treated mice with significantly down-regulated expressions of inflammasome-related genes. Western-blot analysis further demonstrated the negative effect of Ori on NF-κB signaling with diminished phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα as well as suppressed translocation of p65. Furthermore, we indicated that Ori suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in OGD/R induced BV2 microglia cells by inhibiting NF-κB signaling. In summary, our findings make Ori a potential candidate for therapy of cerebral I/R injury in the future.
