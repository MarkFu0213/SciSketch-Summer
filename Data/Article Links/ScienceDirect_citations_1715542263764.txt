Abstract: Summary
Constitutive activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway has been associated with a variety of human pathologies. However, molecular mechanisms through which canonical NF-κB affects hematopoiesis remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that deregulated canonical NF-κB signals in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) cause a complete depletion of HSC pool, pancytopenia, bone marrow failure, and premature death. Constitutive activation of IKK2 in HSCs leads to impaired quiescence and loss of function. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified an induction of “erythroid signature” in HSCs with augmented NF-κB activity. Mechanistic studies indicated a reduction of thrombopoietin (TPO)-mediated signals and its downstream target p57 in HSCs, due to reduced c-Mpl expression in a cell-intrinsic manner. Molecular studies established Klf1 as a key suppressor of c-Mpl in HSPCs with increased NF-κB. In essence, these studies identified a previously unknown mechanism through which exaggerated canonical NF-κB signals affect HSCs and cause pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
To improve our understanding of ovarian cancer, we performed genome-wide analyses of 45 ovarian cancer cell lines. Given the challenges of genomic analyses of tumors without matched normal samples, we developed approaches for detection of somatic sequence and structural changes and integrated these with epigenetic and expression alterations. Alterations not previously implicated in ovarian cancer included amplification or overexpression of ASXL1 and H3F3B, deletion or underexpression of CDC73 and TGF-beta receptor pathway members, and rearrangements of YAP1-MAML2 and IKZF2-ERBB4. Dose-response analyses to targeted therapies revealed unique molecular dependencies, including increased sensitivity of tumors with PIK3CA and PPP2R1A alterations to PI3K inhibitor GNE-493, MYC amplifications to PARP inhibitor BMN673, and SMAD3/4 alterations to MEK inhibitor MEK162. Genome-wide rearrangements provided an improved measure of sensitivity to PARP inhibition. This study provides a comprehensive and broadly accessible resource of molecular information for the development of therapeutic avenues in ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Biological signals need to be robust and filter small fluctuations yet maintain sensitivity to signals across a wide range of magnitudes. Here, we studied how fluctuations in DNA damage signaling relate to maintenance of long-term cell-cycle arrest. Using live-cell imaging, we quantified division profiles of individual human cells in the course of 1 week after irradiation. We found a subset of cells that initially establish cell-cycle arrest and then sporadically escape and divide. Using fluorescent reporters and mathematical modeling, we determined that fluctuations in the oscillatory pattern of the tumor suppressor p53 trigger a sharp switch between p21 and CDK2, leading to escape from arrest. Transient perturbation of p53 stability mimicked the noise in individual cells and was sufficient to trigger escape from arrest. Our results show that the self-reinforcing circuitry that mediates cell-cycle transitions can translate small fluctuations in p53 signaling into large phenotypic changes.

Abstract: Summary
In most eukaryotes, meiotic crossovers are essential for error-free chromosome segregation but are specifically repressed near centromeres to prevent missegregation. Recognized for >85 years, the molecular mechanism of this repression has remained unknown. Meiotic chromosomes contain two distinct cohesin complexes: pericentric complex (for segregation) and chromosomal arm complex (for crossing over). We show that the pericentric-specific complex also actively represses pericentric meiotic double-strand break (DSB) formation and, consequently, crossovers. We uncover the mechanism by which fission yeast heterochromatin protein Swi6 (mammalian HP1-homolog) prevents recruitment of activators of meiotic DSB formation. Localizing missing activators to wild-type pericentromeres bypasses repression and generates abundant crossovers but reduces gamete viability. The molecular mechanism elucidated here likely extends to other species, including humans, where pericentric crossovers can result in disorders, such as Down syndrome. These mechanistic insights provide new clues to understand the roles played by multiple cohesin complexes, especially in human infertility and birth defects.

Abstract: Summary
Contact inhibition of locomotion is defined as the behavior of cells to cease migrating in their former direction after colliding with another cell. It has been implicated in multiple developmental processes and its absence has been linked to cancer invasion. Cellular forces are thought to govern this process; however, the exact role of traction through cell-matrix adhesions and tension through cell-cell adhesions during contact inhibition of locomotion remains unknown. Here we use neural crest cells to address this and show that cell-matrix adhesions are rapidly disassembled at the contact between two cells upon collision. This disassembly is dependent upon the formation of N-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesions and driven by Src and FAK activity. We demonstrate that the loss of cell-matrix adhesions near the contact leads to a buildup of tension across the cell-cell contact, a step that is essential to drive cell-cell separation after collision.

Abstract: Summary
To understand how commitment to cell division in late G1 phase (Start) is controlled by growth and nutrients in budding yeast, we determined the absolute concentrations of the G1/S transcription factors SBF (composed of Swi4 and Swi6) and MBF (composed of Mbp1 and Swi6), the transcriptional repressor Whi5, and the G1 cyclins, Cln1 and Cln2, in single live yeast cells using scanning number and brightness (sN&B) microscopy. In rich medium, Whi5, Mbp1, and Swi6 concentrations were independent of cell size, whereas Swi4 concentration doubled in G1 phase, leading to a size-dependent decrease in the Whi5/Swi4 ratio. In small cells, SBF and MBF copy numbers were insufficient to saturate target G1/S promoters, but this restriction diminished as cells grew in size. In poor medium, SBF and MBF subunits, as well as Cln1, were elevated, consistent with a smaller cell size at Start. A mathematical model constrained by sN&B data suggested that size- and nutrient-dependent occupancy of G1/S promoters by SBF/MBF helps set the cell size threshold for Start activation.

Abstract: Summary
Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a circulating metabolite that has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this paper, we identify blood markers, metabolites, proteins, gut microbiota patterns, and diets that are significantly associated with levels of plasma TMAO. We find that kidney markers are strongly associated with TMAO and identify CVD-related proteins that are positively correlated with TMAO. We show that metabolites derived by the gut microbiota are strongly correlated with TMAO and that the magnitude of this correlation varies with kidney function. Moreover, we identify diet-associated patterns in the microbiome that are correlated with TMAO. These findings suggest that both the process of TMAO accumulation and the mechanism by which TMAO promotes atherosclerosis are a complex interplay between diet and the microbiome on one hand and other system-level factors such as circulating proteins, metabolites, and kidney function.

Abstract: Summary
The import of superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) into mitochondria is vital for the survival of eukaryotic cells. SOD2 is encoded within the nuclear genome and translocated into mitochondria for activation after translation in the cytosol. The molecular chaperone Hsp70 modulates SOD2 activity by promoting import of SOD2 into mitochondria. In turn, the activity of Hsp70 is controlled by co-chaperones, particularly CHIP, which directs Hsp70-bound proteins for degradation in the proteasomes. We investigated the mechanisms controlling the activity of SOD2 to signal activation and maintain mitochondrial redox balance. We demonstrate that Akt1 binds to and phosphorylates the C terminus of Hsp70 on Serine631, which inhibits CHIP-mediated SOD2 degradation thereby stabilizing and promoting SOD2 import. Conversely, increased mitochondrial-H2O2 formation disrupts Akt1-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp70, and non-phosphorylatable Hsp70 mutants decrease SOD2 import, resulting in mitochondrial oxidative stress. Our findings identify Hsp70 phosphorylation as a physiological mechanism essential for regulation of mitochondrial redox balance.

Abstract: Summary
The immunosuppressive transmembrane protein PD-L1 was shown to traffic via the multivesicular body (MVB) and to be released on exosomes. A high-content siRNA screen identified the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-associated protein ALIX as a regulator of both EGFR activity and PD-L1 surface presentation in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells. ALIX depletion results in prolonged and enhanced stimulation-induced EGFR activity as well as defective PD-L1 trafficking through the MVB, reduced exosomal secretion, and its redistribution to the cell surface. Increased surface PD-L1 expression confers an EGFR-dependent immunosuppressive phenotype on ALIX-depleted cells. An inverse association between ALIX and PD-L1 expression was observed in human breast cancer tissues, while an immunocompetent mouse model of breast cancer revealed that ALIX-deficient tumors are larger and show an increased immunosuppressive environment. Our data suggest that ALIX modulates immunosuppression through regulation of PD-L1 and EGFR and may, therefore, present a diagnostic and therapeutic target for BLBC.

Abstract: Summary
Pdgfra+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) arise in distinct specification waves during embryogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS). It is unclear whether there is a correlation between these waves and different oligodendrocyte (OL) states at adult stages. Here, we present bulk and single-cell transcriptomics resources providing insights on how transitions between these states occur. We found that post-natal OPCs from brain and spinal cord present similar transcriptional signatures. Moreover, post-natal OPC progeny of E13.5 Pdgfra+ cells present electrophysiological and transcriptional profiles similar to OPCs derived from subsequent specification waves, indicating that Pdgfra+ pre-OPCs rewire their transcriptional network during development. Single-cell RNA-seq and lineage tracing indicates that a subset of E13.5 Pdgfra+ cells originates cells of the pericyte lineage. Thus, our results indicate that embryonic Pdgfra+ cells in the CNS give rise to distinct post-natal cell lineages, including OPCs with convergent transcriptional profiles in different CNS regions.

Abstract: Summary
The replisome must overcome DNA damage to ensure complete chromosome replication. Here, we describe the earliest events in this process by reconstituting collisions between a eukaryotic replisome, assembled with purified proteins, and DNA damage. Lagging-strand lesions are bypassed without delay, leaving daughter-strand gaps roughly the size of an Okazaki fragment. In contrast, leading-strand polymerase stalling significantly impacts replication fork progression. We reveal that the core replisome itself can bypass leading-strand damage by re-priming synthesis beyond it. Surprisingly, this restart activity is rare, mainly due to inefficient leading-strand re-priming, rather than single-stranded DNA exposure or primer extension. We find several unanticipated mechanistic distinctions between leading- and lagging-strand priming that we propose control the replisome’s initial response to DNA damage. Notably, leading-strand restart was specifically stimulated by RPA depletion, which can occur under conditions of replication stress. Our results have implications for pathway choice at stalled forks and priming at DNA replication origins.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular growth factors signal to transcription factors via a limited number of cytoplasmic kinase cascades. It remains unclear how such cascades encode ligand identities and concentrations. In this paper, we use live-cell imaging and statistical modeling to study FOXO3, a transcription factor regulating diverse aspects of cellular physiology that is under combinatorial control. We show that FOXO3 nuclear-to-cytosolic translocation has two temporally distinct phases varying in magnitude with growth factor identity and cell type. These phases comprise synchronous translocation soon after ligand addition followed by an extended back-and-forth shuttling; this shuttling is pulsatile and does not have a characteristic frequency, unlike a simple oscillator. Early and late dynamics are differentially regulated by Akt and ERK and have low mutual information, potentially allowing the two phases to encode different information. In cancer cells in which ERK and Akt are dysregulated by oncogenic mutation, the diversity of states is lower.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In order to investigate a new treatment fot GIST, we hypothesized the effect of miR-374b targeting PTEN gene-mediated PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway on proliferation and apoptosis of human gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cells. We obtained GIST tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 143 patients with GIST to measure the levels of miR-374b, PTEN, PI3K, Akt, caspase9, Bax, MMP2, MMP9, ki67, PCNA, P53 and cyclinD1. Finally, cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis were detected. According to the KFGG analysis of DEGs, PTEN was involved in a variety of signaling pathways and miRs were associated with cancer development. The results showed that MiR-374b was highly expressed, while PTEN was downregulated in the GIST tissues. The levels of miR-374b, PI3K, AKT and PTEN were related to tumor diameter and pathological stage. Additionally, miR-374b increased the mRNA and protein levels of PI3K, Akt, MMP2, MMP9, P53 and cyclinD1, suggesting that miR-374b activates PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in GIST-T1 cells. Moreover, MiR-374b promoted cell viability, migration, invasion, and cell cycle entry, and inhibited apoptosis in GIST cells. Taken together, the results indicated that miR-374b promotes viability and inhibits apoptosis of human GIST cells by targeting PTEN gene through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Thus, this study provides a new potential target for GIST treatment.

Abstract: Cryptococcus neoformans mutants lacking each of the eight putative chitin synthase genes (CHS) have been previously generated. However, it is still unclear how deletion of chitin synthase genes affects the cryptococcal capsule. Since the connections between chitin metabolism and capsular polysaccharides in C. neoformans are numerous, we analyzed the effects of deletion of CHS genes on capsular and capsule-related structures of C. neoformans. CHS deletion affected capsular morphology in multiple ways, as determined by scanning electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis. Molecular diameter, serological reactivity and export of capsular polysaccharide were also affected in most of the chsΔ mutants, but the most prominent alterations were observed in the chs3Δ strain. C. neoformans cells lacking CHS genes also had altered formation of extracellular vesicles and variable chitinase activity under stress conditions. These results reveal previously unknown functions of CHS genes that greatly impact the physiology of C. neoformans.

Abstract: Summary
We previously identified PLEKHA7 and other junctional proteins as host factors mediating death by S. aureus α-toxin, but the mechanism through which junctions promote toxicity was unclear. Using cell biological and biochemical methods, we now show that ADAM10 is docked to junctions by its transmembrane partner Tspan33, whose cytoplasmic C terminus binds to the WW domain of PLEKHA7 in the presence of PDZD11. ADAM10 is locked at junctions through binding of its cytoplasmic C terminus to afadin. Junctionally clustered ADAM10 supports the efficient formation of stable toxin pores. Instead, disruption of the PLEKHA7-PDZD11 complex inhibits ADAM10 and toxin junctional clustering. This promotes toxin pore removal from the cell surface through an actin- and macropinocytosis-dependent process, resulting in cell recovery from initial injury and survival. These results uncover a dock-and-lock molecular mechanism to target ADAM10 to junctions and provide a paradigm for how junctions regulate transmembrane receptors through their clustering.

Abstract: Summary
How cells adapt to varying environmental conditions is largely unknown. Here, we show that, in budding yeast, the RNA-binding and stress granule protein Pub1 has an intrinsic property to form condensates upon starvation or heat stress and that condensate formation is associated with cell-cycle arrest. Release from arrest coincides with condensate dissolution, which takes minutes (starvation) or hours (heat shock). In vitro reconstitution reveals that the different dissolution rates of starvation- and heat-induced condensates are due to their different material properties: starvation-induced Pub1 condensates form by liquid-liquid demixing and subsequently convert into reversible gel-like particles; heat-induced condensates are more solid-like and require chaperones for disaggregation. Our data suggest that different physiological stresses, as well as stress durations and intensities, induce condensates with distinct physical properties and thereby define different modes of stress adaptation and rates of recovery.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are brain-resident macrophages with trophic and phagocytic functions. Dominant loss-of-function mutations in a key microglia regulator, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), cause adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a progressive white matter disorder. Because it remains unclear precisely how CSF1R mutations affect microglia, we generated an allelic series of csf1r mutants in zebrafish to identify csf1r-dependent microglia changes. We found that csf1r mutations led to aberrant microglia density and distribution and regional loss of microglia. The remaining microglia still had a microglia-specific gene expression signature, indicating that they had differentiated normally. Strikingly, we also observed lower microglia numbers and widespread microglia depletion in postmortem brain tissue of ALSP patients. Both in zebrafish and in human disease, local microglia loss also presented in regions without obvious pathology. Together, this implies that CSF1R mainly regulates microglia density and that early loss of microglia may contribute to ALSP pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Although the outcome of flavivirus infection can vary from asymptomatic to lethal, environmental factors modulating disease severity are poorly defined. Here, we observed increased susceptibility of mice to severe West Nile (WNV), Dengue, and Zika virus infections after treatment with oral antibiotics (Abx) that depleted the gut microbiota. Abx treatment impaired the development of optimal T cell responses, with decreased levels of WNV-specific CD8+ T cells associated with increased infection and immunopathology. Abx treatments that resulted in enhanced WNV susceptibility generated changes in the overall structure of the gut bacterial community and in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa. As little as 3 days of treatment with ampicillin was sufficient to alter host immunity and WNV outcome. Our results identify oral Abx therapy as a potential environmental determinant of systemic viral disease, and they raise the possibility that perturbation of the gut microbiota may have deleterious consequences for subsequent flavivirus infections.

Abstract: Summary
The clostridium-like ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferase ARTC1 is expressed in a highly restricted manner in skeletal muscle and heart tissue. Although ARTC1 is well studied, the identification of ARTC1 targets in vivo and subsequent characterization of ARTC1-regulated cellular processes on the proteome level have been challenging and only a few ARTC1-ADP-ribosylated targets are known. Applying our recently developed mass spectrometry-based workflow to C2C12 myotubes and to skeletal muscle and heart tissues from wild-type mice, we identify hundreds of ARTC1-ADP-ribosylated proteins whose modifications are absent in the ADP-ribosylome of ARTC1-deficient mice. These proteins are ADP-ribosylated on arginine residues and mainly located on the cell surface or in the extracellular space. They are associated with signal transduction, transmembrane transport, and muscle function. Validation of hemopexin (HPX) as a ARTC1-target protein confirmed the functional importance of ARTC1-mediated extracellular arginine ADP-ribosylation at the systems level.

Abstract: Summary
Protein/RNA clusters arise frequently in spatially regulated biological processes, from the asymmetric distribution of P granules and PAR proteins in developing embryos to localized receptor oligomers in migratory cells. This co-occurrence suggests that protein clusters might possess intrinsic properties that make them a useful substrate for spatial regulation. Here, we demonstrate that protein droplets show a robust form of spatial memory, maintaining the spatial pattern of an inhibitor of droplet formation long after it has been removed. Despite this persistence, droplets can be highly dynamic, continuously exchanging monomers with the diffuse phase. We investigate the principles of biophysical spatial memory in three contexts: a computational model of phase separation, a novel optogenetic system where light can drive rapid, localized dissociation of liquid-like protein droplets, and membrane-localized signal transduction from clusters of receptor tyrosine kinases. Our results suggest that the persistent polarization underlying many cellular and developmental processes could arise through a simple biophysical process, without any additional biochemical feedback loops.

Abstract: Calretinin has been detected in various excitable cells but the presence and putative roles of such a calcium-binding protein has never been characterized in sperm. Epididymal spermatozoa were collected from C57Bl6 (wild-type, WT) or calretinin knockout (CR−/−) mice and Wistar rats. A specific staining for calretinin was detected by immunofluorescence in the principal piece of the flagellum, both in WT mouse and rat spermatozoa. Western blots confirmed the expression of calretinin in rat and WT spermatozoa as well as its absence in CR−/− mice. No significant difference was observed in the spontaneous acrosome reaction between WT and CR−/− sperm. The addition of the calcium-ionophore A-23187, Thapsigargin or Progesterone to WT or CR−/− incubated spermatozoa induced increases in the acrosome reaction but the stimulatory effects were identical in both genotypes. Motility measurements assessed by computer-assisted sperm analysis indicated that, under basal non-stimulatory conditions, CR-/- sperm exhibited a lower curvilinear velocity and a smaller lateral head movement amplitude, although no difference was observed for the beat cross frequency. After incubation with 25 mM NH4Cl, the curvilinear velocity, the amplitude of the lateral head movement and the hyperactivation were increased, while the beat cross frequency was decreased, in both genotypes. Evaluation of the in vivo fertility potential indicated that the CR−/− litter sizes were clearly reduced compared to the WT litter sizes. Our study describes, for the first time, the expression of calretinin in sperm. These data extend the potential implication of calcium-binding proteins in the sperm calcium-signaling cascade and bring new insights into the understanding of sperm physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Despite being a highly enriched synaptic vesicle (SV) protein and a candidate gene for autism, the physiological function of SCAMP5 remains mostly enigmatic. Here, using optical imaging and electrophysiological experiments, we demonstrate that SCAMP5 plays a critical role in release site clearance at the active zone. Truncation analysis revealed that the 2/3 loop domain of SCAMP5 directly interacts with adaptor protein 2, and this interaction is critical for its role in release site clearance. Knockdown (KD) of SCAMP5 exhibited pronounced synaptic depression accompanied by a slower recovery of the SV pool. Moreover, it induced a strong frequency-dependent short-term depression of synaptic release, even under the condition of sufficient release-ready SVs. Super-resolution microscopy further proved the defects in SV protein clearance induced by KD. Thus, reduced expression of SCAMP5 may impair the efficiency of SV clearance at the active zone, and this might relate to the synaptic dysfunction observed in autism.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal motoneurons are endowed with nonlinear spiking behaviors manifested by a spike acceleration whose functional significance remains uncertain. Here, we show in rodent lumbar motoneurons that these nonlinear spiking properties do not rely only on activation of dendritic nifedipine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels, as assumed for decades, but also on the slow inactivation of a nifedipine-sensitive K+ current mediated by Kv1.2 channels that are highly expressed in axon initial segments. Specifically, the pharmacological and computational inhibition of Kv1.2 channels occluded the spike acceleration of rhythmically active motoneurons and the correlated slow buildup of rhythmic motor output recorded at the onset of locomotor-like activity. This study demonstrates that slow inactivation of Kv1.2 channels provides a potent gain control mechanism in mammalian spinal motoneurons and has a behavioral role in enhancing locomotor drive during the transition from immobility to steady-state locomotion.

Abstract: Summary
The NUP214-ABL1 fusion is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that is significantly associated with overexpression of the TLX1 and TLX3 transcription factors in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here we show that NUP214-ABL1 cooperates with TLX1 in driving T-ALL development using a transgenic mouse model and human T-ALL cells. Using integrated ChIP-sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, and RNA-sequencing data, we demonstrate that TLX1 and STAT5, the downstream effector of NUP214-ABL1, co-bind poised enhancer regions, and cooperatively activate the expression of key proto-oncogenes such as MYC and BCL2. Inhibition of STAT5, downregulation of TLX1 or MYC, or interference with enhancer function through BET-inhibitor treatment leads to reduction of target gene expression and induction of leukemia cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Aerobic glycolysis accounts for ∼80%–90% of glucose used by adult photoreceptors (PRs); yet, the importance of aerobic glycolysis for PR function or survival remains unclear. Here, we further established the role of aerobic glycolysis in murine rod and cone PRs. We show that loss of hexokinase-2 (HK2), a key aerobic glycolysis enzyme, does not affect PR survival or structure but is required for normal rod function. Rods with HK2 loss increase their mitochondrial number, suggesting an adaptation to the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis. In contrast, cones adapt without increased mitochondrial number but require HK2 to adapt to metabolic stress conditions such as those encountered in retinitis pigmentosa, where the loss of rods causes a nutrient shortage in cones. The data support a model where aerobic glycolysis in PRs is not a necessity but rather a metabolic choice that maximizes PR function and adaptability to nutrient stress conditions.

Abstract: The arabinan-containing polysaccharides, arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), are key cell wall components of the Corynebacterineae, which include Corynebacteria, Norcadia and Mycobacteria. Both AG and LAM contain elaborate arabinan domains composed of distinct structural motifs. Mycobacterial EmbA, EmbB and EmbC, collectively known as the Emb proteins, have been identified as arabinosyltransferases (ArafTs), which are targeted by the front-line anti-tubercular drug ethambutol. Previous studies have established that EmbA and EmbB play a role in the synthesis of the characteristic terminal hexa-arabinosuranosyl motif, whilst EmbC is involved exclusively in the biosynthesis of LAM. Herein, we have investigated the role of the singular Emb protein from Corynebacterium glutamicum through the detailed biochemical and chemical analysis of a double ΔaftAΔemb mutant, where the priming Cg-AftA protein, which generates the substrate for Cg-Emb has been deleted. Analysis of its cell wall revealed a complete absence of arabinose resulting in a truncated cell wall containing only a galactan backbone accompanied with complete loss of cell wall bound mycolates. In vitro cell-free assays using C. glutamicumΔaftA, C. glutamicumΔemb, C. glutamicumΔaftAΔemb and C. glutamicumΔaftBΔaftD and two synthetic acceptors, which mimick the arabinofuranose (Araf) “primed” galactan chain, demonstrated that Cg-Emb is able to transfer an Araf residue to the C5 of the Araf positioned on the synthetic acceptor(s). These results indicate that Cg-Emb acts as an α(1 → 5) ArafT and elongates the arabinan core during the early stages of arabinan biosynthesis in C. glutamicum.

Abstract: Summary
Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is considered a proinflammatory factor that mediates pyroptosis in macrophages to protect hosts from intracellular bacteria. Here, we reveal that GSDMD deficiency paradoxically augmented host responses to extracellular Escherichia coli, mainly by delaying neutrophil death, which established GSDMD as a negative regulator of innate immunity. In contrast to its activation in macrophages, in which activated inflammatory caspases cleave GSDMD to produce an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-cNT) to trigger pyroptosis, GSDMD cleavage and activation in neutrophils was caspase independent. It was mediated by a neutrophil-specific serine protease, neutrophil elastase (ELANE), released from cytoplasmic granules into the cytosol in aging neutrophils. ELANE-mediated GSDMD cleavage was upstream of the caspase cleavage site and produced a fully active ELANE-derived NT fragment (GSDMD-eNT) that induced lytic cell death as efficiently as GSDMD-cNT. Thus, GSDMD is pleiotropic, exerting both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects that make it a potential target for antibacterial and anti-inflammatory therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Acute O2 sensing by peripheral chemoreceptors is essential for mammalian homeostasis. Carotid body glomus cells contain O2-sensitive ion channels, which trigger fast adaptive cardiorespiratory reflexes in response to hypoxia. O2-sensitive cells have unique metabolic characteristics that favor the hypoxic generation of mitochondrial complex I (MCI) signaling molecules, NADH and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which modulate membrane ion channels. We show that responsiveness to hypoxia progressively disappears after inducible deletion of the Ndufs2 gene, which encodes the 49 kDa subunit forming the coenzyme Q binding site in MCI, even in the presence of MCII substrates and chemical NAD+ regeneration. We also show contrasting effects of physiological hypoxia on mitochondrial ROS production (increased in the intermembrane space and decreased in the matrix) and a marked effect of succinate dehydrogenase activity on acute O2 sensing. Our results suggest that acute responsiveness to hypoxia depends on coenzyme QH2/Q ratio-controlled ROS production in MCI.

Abstract: Summary
Some epigenetic modifications are inherited from one generation to the next, providing a potential mechanism for the inheritance of environmentally acquired traits. Transgenerational inheritance of RNAi phenotypes in Caenorhabditis elegans provides an excellent model to study this phenomenon, and although studies have implicated both chromatin modifications and small RNA pathways in heritable silencing, their relative contributions remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the putative histone methyltransferases SET-25 and SET-32 are required for establishment of a transgenerational silencing signal but not for long-term maintenance of this signal between subsequent generations, suggesting that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is a multi-step process with distinct genetic requirements for establishment and maintenance of heritable silencing. Furthermore, small RNA sequencing reveals that the abundance of secondary siRNAs (thought to be the effector molecules of heritable silencing) does not correlate with silencing phenotypes. Together, our results suggest that the current mechanistic models of epigenetic inheritance are incomplete.

Abstract: Summary
Human nineteen complex (NTC) acts as a multimeric E3 ubiquitin ligase in DNA repair and splicing. The transfer of ubiquitin is mediated by Prp19—a homotetrameric component of NTC whose elongated coiled coils serve as an assembly axis for two other proteins called SPF27 and CDC5L. We find that Prp19 is inactive on its own and have elucidated the structural basis of its autoinhibition by crystallography and mutational analysis. Formation of the NTC core by stepwise assembly of SPF27, CDC5L, and PLRG1 onto the Prp19 tetramer enables ubiquitin ligation. Protein-protein crosslinking of NTC, functional assays in vitro, and assessment of its role in DNA damage response provide mechanistic insight into the organization of the NTC core and the communication between PLRG1 and Prp19 that enables E3 activity. This reveals a unique mode of regulation for a complex E3 ligase and advances understanding of its dynamics in various cellular pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Pathways underlying metabolic reprogramming in cancer remain incompletely understood. We identify the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS11B as a gene that promotes transformation of immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). TMPRSS11B is upregulated in human lung squamous cell carcinomas (LSCCs), and high expression is associated with poor survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients. TMPRSS11B inhibition in human LSCCs reduces transformation and tumor growth. Given that TMPRSS11B harbors an extracellular (EC) protease domain, we hypothesized that catalysis of a membrane-bound substrate modulates tumor progression. Interrogation of a set of soluble receptors revealed that TMPRSS11B promotes solubilization of Basigin, an obligate chaperone of the lactate monocarboxylate transporter MCT4. Basigin release mediated by TMPRSS11B enhances lactate export and glycolytic metabolism, thereby promoting tumorigenesis. These findings establish an oncogenic role for TMPRSS11B and provide support for the development of therapies that target this enzyme at the surface of cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
During immunological synapse (IS) formation, T cell receptor (TCR) signaling complexes, integrins, and costimulatory molecules exhibit a particular spatial localization. Here, we develop an agent-based model for the IS formation based on TCR peptide-bound major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) and leukocyte-function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) intracellular activation molecule 1 (ICAM-1) dynamics, including CD28 binding to a costimulatory ligand, coupling of molecules to the centripetal actin flow, and size-based segregation (SBS). A radial gradient of LFA-1 in the peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC) toward the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) emerged as a combined consequence of actin binding and diffusion and modified the positioning of other molecules. The simulations predict a mechanism of CD28 movement, according to which CD28-CD80 complexes passively follow TCR-pMHC microclusters. However, the characteristic CD28-CD80 localization in a ring pattern around the cSMAC only emerges with a particular CD28-actin coupling strength that induces a centripetal motion. These results have implications for the understanding of T cell activation and fate decisions.

Abstract: Summary
Adipocyte mobilization of fatty acids (lipolysis) is instrumental for energy expenditure. Lipolysis displays both spontaneous (basal) and hormone-stimulated activity. It is unknown if lipolysis is important for future body weight gain and associated disturbed glucose metabolism, and this was presently investigated in subcutaneous adipocytes from two female cohorts before and after ≥10-year follow-up. High basal and low stimulated lipolysis at baseline predicted future weight gain (odds ratios ≥4.6) as well as development of insulin resistance and impaired fasting glucose/type 2 diabetes (odds ratios ≥3.2). At baseline, weight gainers displayed lower adipose expression of several established lipolysis-regulating genes. Thus, inefficient lipolysis (high basal/low stimulated) involving altered gene expression is linked to future weight gain and impaired glucose metabolism and may constitute a treatment target. Finally, low stimulated lipolysis could be accurately estimated in vivo by simple clinical/biochemical measures and may be used to identify risk individuals for intensified preventive measures.

Abstract: Summary
Limitation for amino acids is thought to regulate translation in mammalian cells primarily by signaling through the kinases mTORC1 and GCN2. We find that a selective loss of arginine tRNA charging during limitation for arginine regulates translation through ribosome pausing at two of six arginine codons. Surprisingly, limitation for leucine, an essential and abundant amino acid in protein, results in little or no ribosome pausing. Chemical and genetic perturbation of mTORC1 and GCN2 signaling revealed that their robust response to leucine limitation prevents ribosome pausing, while an insufficient response to arginine limitation leads to loss of tRNA charging and ribosome pausing. Ribosome pausing decreases protein production and triggers premature ribosome termination without reducing mRNA levels. Together, our results suggest that amino acids that are not optimally sensed by the mTORC1 and GCN2 pathways still regulate translation through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism based on codon-specific ribosome pausing.

The mechanism involves AIBP binding to Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and increased binding of AIBP to activated microglia, which mediates selective regulation of lipid rafts in inflammatory cells. AIBP-mediated lipid raft reductions downregulate LPS-induced TLR4 dimerization, inflammatory signaling, and expression of cytokines in microglia. In mice, intrathecal injections of AIBP reduce spinal myeloid cell lipid rafts, TLR4 dimerization, neuroinflammation, and glial activation. Intrathecal AIBP reverses established allodynia in mice in which pain states were induced by the chemotherapeutic cisplatin, intraplantar formalin, or intrathecal LPS, all of which are pro-nociceptive interventions known to be regulated by TLR4 signaling. These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which AIBP regulates neuroinflammation and suggest the therapeutic potential of AIBP in treating preexisting pain states.

Abstract: Summary
We show that the loss or gain of transcription factor programs that govern embryonic cell-fate specification is associated with a form of tumor plasticity characterized by the acquisition of alternative cell fates normally characteristic of adjacent organs. In human non-small cell lung cancers, downregulation of the lung lineage-specifying TF NKX2-1 is associated with tumors bearing features of various gut tissues. Loss of Nkx2-1 from murine alveolar, but not airway, epithelium results in conversion of lung cells to gastric-like cells. Superimposing oncogenic Kras activation enables further plasticity in both alveolar and airway epithelium, producing tumors that adopt midgut and hindgut fates. Conversely, coupling Nkx2-1 loss with foregut lineage-specifying SOX2 overexpression drives the formation of squamous cancers with features of esophageal differentiation. These findings demonstrate that elements of pathologic tumor plasticity mirror the normal developmental history of organs in that cancer cells acquire cell fates associated with developmentally related neighboring organs.

Abstract: Patients with head and neck cancer are treated with therapeutic irradiation, which can result in irreversible salivary gland dysfunction. Because there is no complete cure for such patients, stem cell therapy is an emerging alternative for functional restoration of salivary glands. In this study, we investigated in vitro characteristics of primarily isolated epithelial cells from human salivary gland (Epi-SGs) and in vivo formation of acini-like structures by Epi-SGs. Primarily isolated Epi-SGs showed typical epithelial cell-like morphology and expressed E-cadherin but not N-cadherin. Epi-SGs expressed epithelial stem cell (EpiSC) and embryonic stem cell (ESC) markers. During long-term culture, the expression of EpiSC and ESC markers was highly detected and maintained within the core population with small size and low cytoplasmic complexity. The core population expressed cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 14, known as duct markers indicating that Epi-SGs might be originated from the duct. When Epi-SGs were transplanted in vivo with Matrigel, acini-like structures were readily formed at 4 days after transplantation and they were maintained at 7 days after transplantation. Taken together, our data suggested that Epi-SGs might contain stem cells which were positive for EpiSC and ESC markers, and Epi-SGs might contribute to the regeneration of acini-like structures in vivo. We expect that Epi-SGs will be useful source for the functional restoration of damaged salivary gland.

Abstract: Summary
Allosteric regulation is found across all domains of life, yet we still lack simple, predictive theories that directly link the experimentally tunable parameters of a system to its input-output response. To that end, we present a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. We rigorously test this model using the ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the behavior of strains that span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA binding strengths and then constructing and measuring their response. Our model not only accurately captures the induction profiles of these strains, but also enables us to derive analytic expressions for key properties such as the dynamic range and [EC50]. Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy of allosteric repressors that enables us to collapse our experimental data onto a single master curve that captures the diverse phenomenology of the induction profiles.

Abstract: Gastric cancer is the fifth most common type of malignancy worldwide, and the survival rate of patients with advanced-stage gastric cancer is low, even after receiving chemotherapy. Here, we validated neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) as a potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer. We compared NTSR1 expression levels in sixty different gastric cancer-tissue samples and cells, as well as in other cancer cells (lung, breast, pancreatic, and colon), by assessing NTSR1 expression via semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry and western blot. Following neurotensin (NT) treatment, we analyzed the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and further determined the effects on cell migration and invasion via wound-healing and transwell assays. Our results revealed that NTSR1 mRNA levels were higher in gastric cancer tissues than non-cancerous tissues. Both of NTSR1 mRNA levels and expression were higher in gastric cancer cell lines relative to levels observed in other cancer-cell lines. Moreover, NT treatment induced MMP-9 expression and activity in all cancer cell lines, which was significantly decreased following treatment with the NTSR1 antagonist SR48692 or small-interfering RNA targeting NTSR1. Furthermore, NT-mediated metastases was confirmed by observing epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers SNAIL and E-cadherin in gastric cancer cells. NT-mediated invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells were reduced by NTSR1 depletion through the Erk signaling. These findings strongly suggested that NTR1 constitutes a potential therapeutic target for the inhibition of gastric cancer invasion and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic linkage analysis previously suggested that GKAP, a scaffold protein of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), was a potential modifier of invasion in a mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PanNET). Here, we establish that GKAP governs invasive growth and treatment response to NMDAR inhibitors of PanNET via its pivotal role in regulating NMDAR pathway activity. Combining genetic knockdown of GKAP and pharmacological inhibition of NMDAR, we implicate as downstream effectors FMRP and HSF1, which along with GKAP demonstrably support invasiveness of PanNET and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer cells. Furthermore, we distilled genome-wide expression profiles orchestrated by the NMDAR-GKAP signaling axis, identifying transcriptome signatures in tumors with low/inhibited NMDAR activity that significantly associate with favorable patient prognosis in several cancer types.

Abstract: Summary
Lateral diffusion on the neuronal plasma membrane of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) serves an important role in synaptic plasticity. We investigated the role of the secreted glycoprotein Noelin1 (Olfactomedin-1 or Pancortin) in AMPAR lateral mobility and its dependence on the extracellular matrix (ECM). We found that Noelin1 interacts with the AMPAR with high affinity, however, without affecting rise- and decay time and desensitization properties. Noelin1 co-localizes with synaptic and extra-synaptic AMPARs and is expressed at synapses in an activity-dependent manner. Single-particle tracking shows that Noelin1 reduces lateral mobility of both synaptic and extra-synaptic GluA1-containing receptors and affects short-term plasticity. While the ECM does not constrain the synaptic pool of AMPARs and acts only extrasynaptically, Noelin1 contributes to synaptic potentiation by limiting AMPAR mobility at synaptic sites. This is the first evidence for the role of a secreted AMPAR-interacting protein on mobility of GluA1-containing receptors and synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Development of an effective vaccine became a worldwide priority after the devastating 2013–2016 Ebola disease outbreak. To qualitatively profile the humoral response against advanced filovirus vaccine candidates, we developed Domain Programmable Arrays (DPA), a systems serology platform to identify epitopes targeted after vaccination or filovirus infection. We optimized the assay using a panel of well-characterized monoclonal antibodies. After optimization, we utilized the system to longitudinally characterize the immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype-specific responses in non-human primates vaccinated with rVSV-ΔG-EBOV-glycoprotein (GP). Strikingly, we observed that, although the IgM response was directed against epitopes over the whole GP, the IgG and IgA responses were almost exclusively directed against the mucin-like domain (MLD) of the glycan cap. Further research will be needed to characterize this possible biased IgG and IgA response toward the MLD, but the results corroborate that DPA is a valuable tool to qualitatively measure the humoral response after vaccination.

Abstract: Summary
The cerebellum plays a role in coordination of movements and non-motor functions. Cerebellar nuclei (CN) axons connect to various parts of the thalamo-cortical network, but detailed information on the characteristics of cerebello-thalamic connections is lacking. Here, we assessed the cerebellar input to the ventrolateral (VL), ventromedial (VM), and centrolateral (CL) thalamus. Confocal and electron microscopy showed an increased density and size of CN axon terminals in VL compared to VM or CL. Electrophysiological recordings in vitro revealed that optogenetic CN stimulation resulted in enhanced charge transfer and action potential firing in VL neurons compared to VM or CL neurons, despite that the paired-pulse ratio was not significantly different. Together, these findings indicate that the impact of CN input onto neurons of different thalamic nuclei varies substantially, which highlights the possibility that cerebellar output differentially controls various parts of the thalamo-cortical network.

Abstract: Summary
Functional networks in the mammalian cerebral cortex rely on the interaction between glutamatergic pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons. Both neuronal populations exhibit an extraordinary divergence in morphology and targeting areas, which ultimately dictate their precise function in cortical circuits. How these prominent morphological differences arise during development is not well understood. Here, we conducted a high-throughput screen for genes differentially expressed by pyramidal cells and interneurons during cortical wiring. We found that NEK7, a kinase involved in microtubule polymerization, is mostly expressed in parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons at the time when they establish their connectivity. Functional experiments revealed that NEK7-deficient PV+ interneurons show altered microtubule dynamics, axon growth cone steering and reduced axon length, arbor complexity, and total number of synaptic contacts formed with pyramidal cells. Altogether, our results reveal a molecular mechanism by which the microtubule-associated kinase NEK7 regulates the wiring of PV+ interneurons.

Abstract: The inner blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is made up by the neurovascular unit, consisting of endothelial cells, pericytes and glial cells. The BRB maintains homeostasis of the neural retina, but in pathological eye conditions the neurovascular unit is often disrupted, causing BRB loss. Here, we investigated in detail temporal and spatial recruitment of the neurovascular unit in the neonatal mouse retina from postnatal day (P)3 to P25 employing immunohistochemical staining of vascular endothelium (isolectin B4), pericytes (α-SMA and NG2) and astrocytes (GFAP). In addition, we investigated gene expression of polarized astrocytic end-feet markers aquaporin-4 and laminin α2 chain with qPCR. We observed GFAP-positive cells migrating ahead of the retinal vasculature during the first postnatal week, suggesting that the retinal vasculature follows an astrocytic meshwork. From P9 onwards, astrocytes acquired a mature phenotype, with a more stellate shape and increased expression of aquaporin-4. NG2-positive cells and tip cells co-localized at P5 and invaded the retina together as a vascular sprouting front. In summary, these data suggest that recruitment of the cell types of the neurovascular unit is a prerequisite for proper retinal vascularization and BRB formation.

Abstract: Summary
The zona pellucida surrounding ovulated eggs regulates monospermic fertilization necessary for successful development. Using mouse transgenesis, we document that the N terminus of ZP2 is sufficient for sperm binding to the zona matrix and for in vivo fertility. Sperm binding is independent of ZP2 glycans and does not occur after complete cleavage of ZP2 by ovastacin, a zinc metalloendopeptidase stored in egg cortical granules. Immediately following fertilization, a rapid block to sperm penetration of the zona pellucida is established that precedes ZP2 cleavage but requires ovastacin enzymatic activity. This block to penetration is associated with release of zinc from cortical granules coincident with exocytosis. High levels of zinc affect forward motility of sperm to prevent their passage through the zona matrix. This transient, post-fertilization block to sperm penetration provides a temporal window to complete the cleavage of ZP2, which prevents sperm binding to ensure monospermy.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of energy expenditure in thermogenic fat is a promising strategy to improve metabolic health, yet the dynamic processes that evoke this response are poorly understood. Here we show that synthesis of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin is indispensable for stimulating and sustaining thermogenic fat function. Cardiolipin biosynthesis is robustly induced in brown and beige adipose upon cold exposure. Mimicking this response through overexpression of cardiolipin synthase (Crls1) enhances energy consumption in mouse and human adipocytes. Crls1 deficiency in thermogenic adipocytes diminishes inducible mitochondrial uncoupling and elicits a nuclear transcriptional response through endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated retrograde communication. Cardiolipin depletion in brown and beige fat abolishes adipose thermogenesis and glucose uptake, which renders animals insulin resistant. We further identify a rare human CRLS1 variant associated with insulin resistance and show that adipose CRLS1 levels positively correlate with insulin sensitivity. Thus, adipose cardiolipin has a powerful impact on organismal energy homeostasis through thermogenic fat bioenergetics.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative oxidases (AOXs) bypass respiratory complexes III and IV by transferring electrons from coenzyme Q directly to O2. They have therefore been proposed as a potential therapeutic tool for mitochondrial diseases. We crossed the severely myopathic skeletal muscle-specific COX15 knockout (KO) mouse with an AOX-transgenic mouse. Surprisingly, the double KO-AOX mutants had decreased lifespan and a substantial worsening of the myopathy compared with KO alone. Decreased ROS production in KO-AOX versus KO mice led to impaired AMPK/PGC-1α signaling and PAX7/MYOD-dependent muscle regeneration, blunting compensatory responses. Importantly, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine had a similar effect, decreasing the lifespan of KO mice. Our findings have major implications for understanding pathogenic mechanisms in mitochondrial diseases and for the design of therapies, highlighting the benefits of ROS signaling and the potential hazards of antioxidant treatment.

Abstract: Summary
T cells are a versatile immune cell population responding to challenges by differentiation and proliferation followed by contraction and memory formation. Dynamic metabolic reprogramming is essential for T cells to meet the biosynthetic needs and the reutilization of biomolecules, processes that require active participation of metabolite transporters. Here, we show that equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3 (ENT3) is highly expressed in peripheral T cells and has a key role in maintaining T cell homeostasis by supporting the proliferation and survival of T cells. ENT3 deficiency leads to an enlarged and disturbed lysosomal compartment, resulting in accumulation of surplus mitochondria, elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and DNA damage in T cells. Our results identify ENT3 as a vital metabolite transporter that supports T cell homeostasis and activation by regulating lysosomal integrity and the availability of nucleosides. Moreover, we uncovered that T cell lysosomes are an important source of salvaged metabolites for survival and proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Signal transmission among cells enables long-range coordination in biological systems. However, the scarcity of quantitative measurements hinders the development of theories that relate signal propagation to cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization. We address this problem in a bacterial community that employs electrochemical cell-to-cell communication. We developed a model based on percolation theory, which describes how signals propagate through a heterogeneous medium. Our model predicts that signal transmission becomes possible when the community is organized near a critical phase transition between a disconnected and a fully connected conduit of signaling cells. By measuring population-level signal transmission with single-cell resolution in wild-type and genetically modified communities, we confirm that the spatial distribution of signaling cells is organized at the predicted phase transition. Our findings suggest that at this critical point, the population-level benefit of signal transmission outweighs the single-cell level cost. The bacterial community thus appears to be organized according to a theoretically predicted spatial heterogeneity that promotes efficient signal transmission.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancer profiling is a powerful approach for discovering cis-regulatory elements that define the core transcriptional regulatory circuits of normal and malignant cells. Gene control through enhancer activity is often dominated by a subset of lineage-specific transcription factors. By integrating measures of chromatin accessibility and enrichment for H3K27 acetylation, we have generated regulatory landscapes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples and representative cell lines. With super enhancer-based modeling of regulatory circuits and assessments of transcription factor dependencies, we discover that the essential super enhancer factor PAX5 dominates CLL regulatory nodes and is essential for CLL cell survival. Targeting enhancer signaling via BET bromodomain inhibition disrupts super enhancer-dependent gene expression with selective effects on CLL core regulatory circuitry, conferring potent anti-tumor activity.

Abstract: Summary
When faced with proteotoxic stress, cells mount adaptive responses to eliminate aberrant proteins. Adaptive responses increase the expression of protein folding and degradation factors to enhance the cellular quality control machinery. However, it is unclear whether and how this augmented machinery acquires new activities during stress. Here, we uncover a regulatory cascade in budding yeast that consists of the hydrophilin protein Roq1/Yjl144w, the HtrA-type protease Ynm3/Nma111, and the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1. Various stresses stimulate ROQ1 transcription. The Roq1 protein is cleaved by Ynm3. Cleaved Roq1 interacts with Ubr1, transforming its substrate specificity. Altered substrate recognition by Ubr1 accelerates proteasomal degradation of misfolded as well as native proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and in the cytosol. We term this pathway stress-induced homeostatically regulated protein degradation (SHRED) and propose that it promotes physiological adaptation by reprogramming a key component of the quality control machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Therapeutic antibodies targeting ovarian cancer (OvCa)-enriched receptors have largely been disappointing due to limited tumor-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Here we report a symbiotic approach that is highly selective and superior compared with investigational clinical antibodies. This bispecific-anchored cytotoxicity activator antibody is rationally designed to instigate “cis” and “trans” cytotoxicity by combining specificities against folate receptor alpha-1 (FOLR1) and death receptor 5 (DR5). Whereas the in vivo agonist DR5 signaling requires FcγRIIB interaction, the FOLR1 anchor functions as a primary clustering point to retain and maintain a high level of tumor-specific apoptosis. The presented proof of concept study strategically makes use of a tumor cell-enriched anchor receptor for agonist death receptor targeting to potentially generate a clinically viable strategy for OvCa.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila tumor suppressor genes have revealed molecular pathways that control tissue growth, but mechanisms that regulate mitogenic signaling are far from understood. Here we report that the Drosophila TSG tumorous imaginal discs (tid), whose phenotypes were previously attributed to mutations in a DnaJ-like chaperone, are in fact driven by the loss of the N-linked glycosylation pathway component ALG3. tid/alg3 imaginal discs display tissue growth and architecture defects that share characteristics of both neoplastic and hyperplastic mutants. Tumorous growth is driven by inhibited Hippo signaling, induced by excess Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity. We show that ectopic JNK activation is caused by aberrant glycosylation of a single protein, the fly tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor homolog, which results in increased binding to the continually circulating TNF. Our results suggest that N-linked glycosylation sets the threshold of TNF receptor signaling by modifying ligand-receptor interactions and that cells may alter this modification to respond appropriately to physiological cues.

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication introduces a dosage imbalance between early and late replicating genes. In budding yeast, buffering gene expression against this imbalance depends on marking replicated DNA by H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac). Whether additional processes are required for suppressing transcription from H3K56ac-labeled DNA remains unknown. Here, using a database-guided candidate screen, we find that COMPASS, the H3K4 methyltransferase, and its upstream effector, PAF1C, act downstream of H3K56ac to buffer expression. Replicated genes show reduced abundance of the transcription activating mark H3K4me3 and accumulate the transcription inhibitory mark H3K4me2 near transcription start sites. Notably, in hydroxyurea-exposed cells, the S phase checkpoint stabilizes H3K56ac and becomes essential for buffering. We suggest that H3K56ac suppresses transcription of replicated genes by interfering with post-replication recovery of epigenetic marks and assign a new function for the S phase checkpoint in stabilizing this mechanism during persistent dosage imbalance.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that promote or inhibit receptor function hold promise as therapeutics for cancer and autoimmunity. Rules governing their diverse range of functions, however, are lacking. Here we determined characteristics of nine hCD40 mAbs engaging epitopes throughout the CD40 extracellular region expressed as varying isotypes. All mAb formats were strong agonists when hyper-crosslinked; however, only those binding the membrane-distal cysteine-rich domain 1 (CRD1) retained agonistic activity with physiological Fc gamma receptor crosslinking or as human immunoglobulin G2 isotype; agonistic activity decreased as epitopes drew closer to the membrane. In addition, all CRD2-4 binding mAbs blocked CD40 ligand interaction and were potent antagonists. Thus, the membrane distal CRD1 provides a region of choice for selecting CD40 agonists while CRD2-4 provides antagonistic epitopes.

Abstract: Summary
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer genomics dataset includes over 10,000 tumor-normal exome pairs across 33 different cancer types, in total >400 TB of raw data files requiring analysis. Here we describe the Multi-Center Mutation Calling in Multiple Cancers project, our effort to generate a comprehensive encyclopedia of somatic mutation calls for the TCGA data to enable robust cross-tumor-type analyses. Our approach accounts for variance and batch effects introduced by the rapid advancement of DNA extraction, hybridization-capture, sequencing, and analysis methods over time. We present best practices for applying an ensemble of seven mutation-calling algorithms with scoring and artifact filtering. The dataset created by this analysis includes 3.5 million somatic variants and forms the basis for PanCan Atlas papers. The results have been made available to the research community along with the methods used to generate them. This project is the result of collaboration from a number of institutes and demonstrates how team science drives extremely large genomics projects.

Abstract: Summary
The importance of producing the correct numbers of neurons during development is illustrated by both evolutionary enhancement of cognitive capacities in larger brains, and developmental disorders of brain size. In humans, increased neuronal numbers during development is speculated to partly derive from a unique subtype of neural stem cells (NSCs) that undergo a phase of expansion through symmetric self-amplifying divisions before generating neurons. Symmetric amplification also appears to underlie adult neural stem maintenance in the mouse. However, the mechanisms regulating this behavior are unclear. We report the discovery of self-amplifying NSCs in Drosophila and show that they arise by a spatiotemporal conversion of classical self-renewing NSCs. This conversion is regulated by a temporal transition in the expression of proneural transcription factors prior to cell division. We find a causal link between stem cell self-amplification and increased neuronal numbers. We further show that the temporal transcriptional switch controls both stem cell division and subsequent neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Many cellular processes, including pulsatile release of insulin, are triggered by increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+. This study examines how somatostatin affects glucose generation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillations in mouse islets in absence and presence of tolbutamide blockade of the KATP channels. Ca2+ was measured with dual wavelength microflurometry in isolated islets loaded with the indicator Fura-2. Rise of glucose from 3 to 20 mM evoked introductory lowering of Ca2+ prolonged by activation of somatostatin receptors. During continued superfusion exposure to somatostatin triggered oscillations mediated by periodic increase from the basal level (absence of tolbutamide) or by periodic interruption of an elevated level (presence of tolbutamide). In the latter situation the oscillations were transformed into sustained elevation by activation of muscarinic receptors (acetylcholine) or increase of cyclic AMP (IBMX, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, forskolin). The observed effect of cyclic AMP raises the question whether high proportions of the glucagon-producing α-cells promote steady-state elevation of Ca2+. In support for this idea somatostatin was found to trigger glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations essentially in small islets that contain very few α-cells. The results indicate that somatostatin promotes glucose generation of Ca2+oscillations with similar characteristics both in the absence and presence of functional KATP channels.

Abstract: Summary
Protruding from the apical surface of inner ear sensory cells, hair bundles carry out mechanotransduction. Bundle growth involves sequential and overlapping cellular processes, which are concealed within gene expression profiles of individual cells. To dissect such processes, we developed CellTrails, a tool for uncovering, analyzing, and visualizing single-cell gene-expression dynamics. Utilizing quantitative gene-expression data for key bundle proteins from single cells of the developing chick utricle, we reconstructed de novo a bifurcating trajectory that spanned from progenitor cells to mature striolar and extrastriolar hair cells. Extraction and alignment of developmental trails and association of pseudotime with bundle length measurements linked expression dynamics of individual genes with bundle growth stages. Differential trail analysis revealed high-resolution dynamics of transcripts that control striolar and extrastriolar bundle development, including those that encode proteins that regulate [Ca2+]i or mediate crosslinking and lengthening of actin filaments.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are a key immune-competent cell type that respond to environmental and physiological changes during ischemic stroke. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling post-ischemic microglia activity are unclear. Understanding these mechanisms may ultimately reduce disease burden and allow the manipulation of microglia responses to shape the outcomes of stroke. Here, we report that, after experimentally induced stroke, ZEB1 is highly expressed in ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere, where it is upregulated mainly in microglia. Using a conditional transgenic mouse, we found that ZEB1 upregulation in microglia regulates immune responses in the CNS and alleviates brain injury after ischemic stroke. Our data indicate that ZEB1 overexpression mediates microglia responses and, in turn, inhibits the production of astrocytic CXCL1 through the TGF-β1-dependent pathway. Reduced CXCL1 leads to a decline in neutrophil infiltration into the brain, thereby reducing CNS inflammation. Our results demonstrate the importance of ZEB1 in microglia-orchestrated neuroinflammation and suggest a potential means for reducing stroke-induced neurological injury.

Abstract: Summary
The bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) capitalizes on natural killer (NK) cell production of regulatory interleukin (IL)-10 to establish severe systemic infections. Here, we identify regulators of this IL-10 secretion. We show that IL-18 signals to NK cells license their ability to produce IL-10. IL-18 acts independent of IL-12 and STAT4, which co-stimulate IFNγ secretion. Dendritic cell (DC) expression of Nlrp3 is required for IL-18 release in response to the Lm p60 virulence protein. Therefore, mice lacking Nlrp3, Il18, or Il18R fail to accumulate serum IL-10 and are highly resistant to systemic Lm infection. We further show that cells expressing or dependent on Batf3 are required for IL-18-inducing IL-10 production observed in infected mice. These findings explain how Il18 and Batf3 promote susceptibility to bacterial infection and demonstrate the ability of Lm to exploit NLRP3 for the promotion of regulatory NK cell activity.

Abstract: Bacterial peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGT) catalyse the essential polymerization of lipid II into linear glycan chains required for peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The PGT domain is composed of a large head subdomain and a smaller jaw subdomain and can be potently inhibited by the antibiotic moenomycin A (MoeA). We present an X-ray structure of the MoeA-bound Staphylococcus aureus monofunctional PGT enzyme, revealing electron density for a second MoeA bound to the jaw subdomain as well as the PGT donor site. Isothermal titration calorimetry confirms two drug-binding sites with markedly different affinities and positive cooperativity. Hydrophobic cluster analysis suggests that the membrane-interacting surface of the jaw subdomain has structural and physicochemical properties similar to amphipathic cationic α-helical antimicrobial peptides for lipid II recognition and binding. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of the drug-free and -bound forms of the enzyme demonstrate the importance of the jaw subdomain movement for lipid II selection and polymerization process and provide molecular-level insights into the mechanism of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by PGTs.

Abstract: L-pipecolic acid is a non-protein amino acid commonly found in plants, animals, and microorganisms. It is a well-known precursor to numerous microbial secondary metabolites and pharmaceuticals, including anticancer agents, immunosuppressants, and several antibiotics. Lysine cyclodeaminase (LCD) catalyzes β-deamination of L-lysine into L-pipecolic acid using β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor. Expression of a human homolog of LCD, μ-crystallin, is elevated in prostate cancer patients. To understand the structural features and catalytic mechanisms of LCD, we determined the crystal structures of Streptomyces pristinaespiralis LCD (SpLCD) in (i) a binary complex with NAD+, (ii) a ternary complex with NAD+ and L-pipecolic acid, (iii) a ternary complex with NAD+ and L-proline, and (iv) a ternary complex with NAD+ and L-2,4-diamino butyric acid. The overall structure of SpLCD was similar to that of ornithine cyclodeaminase from Pseudomonas putida. In addition, SpLCD recognized L-lysine, L-ornithine, and L-2,4-diamino butyric acid despite differences in the active site, including differences in hydrogen bonding by Asp236, which corresponds with Asp228 from Pseudomonas putida ornithine cyclodeaminase. The substrate binding pocket of SpLCD allowed substrates smaller than lysine to bind, thus enabling binding to ornithine and L-2,4-diamino butyric acid. Our structural and biochemical data facilitate a detailed understanding of substrate and product recognition, thus providing evidence for a reaction mechanism for SpLCD. The proposed mechanism is unusual in that NAD+ is initially converted into NADH and then reverted back into NAD+ at a late stage of the reaction.

Abstract: Summary
The oligodendrocyte lineage is responsible for myelination of the central nervous system. Post-translational modifications are known to regulate oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. The role of arginine methylation during oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination is still poorly understood. We generated mice depleted of PRMT5 in OPCs using Olig2-Cre, and these mice developed severe hypomyelination and died at the third post-natal week. PRMT5-deficient cells have lower levels of PDGFRα at the plasma membrane due to increased degradation by the Cbl E3 ligase. Mechanistically, the loss of arginine methylation at R554 of the PDGFRα intracellular domain unmasks a Cbl binding site at Y555. We observed the progressive decrease in PRMT5 during oligodendrocyte differentiation, and we show that one role of this decrease is to downregulate growth signals provided by PDGFRα to initiate oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. More broadly, the inhibition of PRMT5 may be used therapeutically to manipulate PDGFRα bioavailability.

Abstract: Eukaryotic elongation factors 2 (eEF2) plays an essential role in the GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome along mRNA. Previous studies have shown that eEF2 is overexpressed in various tumors. However, little is known about the role of eEF2 in ovarian cancer. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of eEF2 on ovarian cancer proliferation. We first measured eEF2 protein expression by western blot using six fresh ovarian cancer tissues from G1 to G3. The results showed that eEF2 expression gradually increased from G1 to G3. Additionally, eEF2 expression correlated significantly with grade (P = 0.045), FIGO stage (P = 0.035) and Ki67 (P < 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant positive association between eEF2 expression and Ki67 (r = 0.855). Cox’s proportional hazards model also showed that eEF2 (P = 0.004) and Ki67 (P < 0.001) were an independent prognostic factor of overall survival in ovarian cancer patients. In vitro, after the release of ovarian cancer cell line (HO8910) from serum starvation, the expression of eEF2, cyclinD1 and PCNA was up-regulated. Moreover, silencing eEF2 in HO8910 cells decreased cell proliferation. Finally, we hypothesize that eEF2 may be activated in a positive feedback cycle through inactivation of eEF2K via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. These data provide novel insights into developing experimental therapies for ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferons (IFNs) are central components of the antiviral response. Most cell types respond to viral infections by secreting IFNs, but the mechanisms that regulate correct expression of these cytokines are not completely understood. Here, we show that activation of the type I IFN response regulates the expression of miRNAs in a post-transcriptional manner. Activation of IFN expression alters the binding of the Microprocessor complex to pri-miRNAs, reducing its processing rate and thus leading to decreased levels of a subset of mature miRNAs in an IRF3-dependent manner. The rescue of Microprocessor function during the antiviral response downregulates the levels of IFN-β and IFN-stimulated genes. All these findings support a model by which the inhibition of Microprocessor activity is an essential step to induce a robust type I IFN response in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas immune systems integrate short segments of foreign DNA as spacers into the host CRISPR locus to provide molecular memory of infection. Cas4 proteins are widespread in CRISPR-Cas systems and are thought to participate in spacer acquisition, although their exact function remains unknown. Here we show that Bacillus halodurans type I-C Cas4 is required for efficient prespacer processing prior to Cas1-Cas2-mediated integration. Cas4 interacts tightly with the Cas1 integrase, forming a heterohexameric complex containing two Cas1 dimers and two Cas4 subunits. In the presence of Cas1 and Cas2, Cas4 processes double-stranded substrates with long 3′ overhangs through site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage. Cas4 recognizes PAM sequences within the prespacer and prevents integration of unprocessed prespacers, ensuring that only functional spacers will be integrated into the CRISPR array. Our results reveal the critical role of Cas4 in maintaining fidelity during CRISPR adaptation, providing a structural and mechanistic model for prespacer processing and integration.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory perception depends on interactions among cortical areas. These interactions are mediated by canonical patterns of connectivity in which higher areas send feedback projections to lower areas via neurons in superficial and deep layers. Here, we probed the circuit basis of interactions among two areas critical for touch perception in mice, whisker primary (wS1) and secondary (wS2) somatosensory cortices. Neurons in layer 4 of wS2 (S2L4) formed a major feedback pathway to wS1. Feedback from wS2 to wS1 was organized somatotopically. Spikes evoked by whisker deflections occurred nearly as rapidly in wS2 as in wS1, including among putative S2L4 → S1 feedback neurons. Axons from S2L4 → S1 neurons sent stimulus orientation-specific activity to wS1. Optogenetic excitation of S2L4 neurons modulated activity across both wS2 and wS1, while inhibition of S2L4 reduced orientation tuning among wS1 neurons. Thus, a non-canonical feedback circuit, originating in layer 4 of S2, rapidly modulates early tactile processing.

Abstract: Summary
Large-scale, cooperative rearrangements underlie the functions of RNA in RNA-protein machines and gene regulation. To understand how such rearrangements are orchestrated, we used high-throughput chemical footprinting to dissect a seemingly concerted rearrangement in P5abc RNA, a paradigm of RNA folding studies. With mutations that systematically disrupt or restore putative structural elements, we found that this transition reflects local folding of structural modules, with modest and incremental cooperativity that results in concerted behavior. First, two distant secondary structure changes are coupled through a bridging three-way junction and Mg2+-dependent tertiary structure. Second, long-range contacts are formed between modules, resulting in additional cooperativity. Given the sparseness of RNA tertiary contacts after secondary structure formation, we expect that modular folding and incremental cooperativity are generally important for specifying functional structures while also providing productive kinetic paths to these structures. Additionally, we expect our approach to be useful for uncovering modularity in other complex RNAs.

Abstract: Intestinal epithelium develops during gestation and continues to mature post-natally into a selective barrier that will protect the individual while still allowing passage of nutrients. Until fully mature, the risk of translocation of microorganisms, toxins or antigens into the sub-epithelial tissue is high and could result in pathologies with life-altering consequences, or even premature death. Because of their monogamous mating system, prairie voles are an emerging model for studying the role of the intestinal microbiota in modulating social behavior via the microbiota-gut-brain-behavior axis. However, knowledge about the voles’ intestinal barrier maturation is lacking. Understanding the maturation of the intestine epithelial barrier can complement the extensive behavioral literature for future studies involving the vole gut-brain axis. In this study, we characterized intestinal barrier function by demonstrating that two-week-old prairie voles have high paracellular absorption of FITC-dextran molecules prior to markedly decreased permeability at three weeks of age. In light of the fundamental role of tight junctions in maintaining epithelial integrity regulating intestinal permeability, we examined tight junction gene expression profiles. Transmission electron microscopy was used to visualize tight junction structure. Our results provide a timeline for intestinal barrier maturation and point to tight junction proteins involved in this process in prairie voles.

Abstract: Summary
In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), cytoplasmic aggregates of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 accumulate and colocalize with some stress granule components, but how pathological TDP-43 aggregation is nucleated remains unknown. In Drosophila, we establish that downregulation of tankyrase, a poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase, reduces TDP-43 accumulation in the cytoplasm and potently mitigates neurodegeneration. We establish that TDP-43 non-covalently binds to PAR via PAR-binding motifs embedded within its nuclear localization sequence. PAR binding promotes liquid-liquid phase separation of TDP-43 in vitro and is required for TDP-43 accumulation in stress granules in mammalian cells and neurons. Stress granule localization initially protects TDP-43 from disease-associated phosphorylation, but upon long-term stress, stress granules resolve, leaving behind aggregates of phosphorylated TDP-43. Finally, small-molecule inhibition of Tankyrase-1/2 in mammalian cells inhibits formation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 foci without affecting stress granule assembly. Thus, Tankyrase inhibition antagonizes TDP-43-associated pathology and neurodegeneration and could have therapeutic utility for ALS and FTD.

Abstract: Summary
Centrosomal abnormalities, in particular centrosome amplification, are recurrent features of human tumors. Enforced centrosome amplification in vivo plays a role in tumor initiation and progression. However, centrosome amplification occurs only in a subset of cancer cells, and thus, partly due to this heterogeneity, the contribution of centrosome amplification to tumors is unknown. Here, we show that supernumerary centrosomes induce a paracrine-signaling axis via the secretion of proteins, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), which leads to non-cell-autonomous invasion in 3D mammary organoids and zebrafish models. This extra centrosomes-associated secretory phenotype (ECASP) promotes invasion of human mammary cells via HER2 signaling activation. Further, we demonstrate that centrosome amplification induces an early oxidative stress response via increased NOX-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn mediates secretion of pro-invasive factors. The discovery that cells with extra centrosomes can manipulate the surrounding cells highlights unexpected and far-reaching consequences of these abnormalities in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are indispensable for non-image-forming visual responses that sustain under prolonged illumination. For sustained signaling of ipRGCs, the melanopsin photopigment must continuously regenerate. The underlying mechanism is unknown. We discovered that a cluster of Ser/Thr sites within the C-terminal region of mammalian melanopsin is phosphorylated after a light pulse. This forms a binding site for β-arrestin 1 (βARR1) and β-arrestin 2. β-arrestin 2 primarily regulates the deactivation of melanopsin; accordingly, βαrr2−/− mice exhibit prolonged ipRGC responses after cessation of a light pulse. β-arrestin 1 primes melanopsin for regeneration. Therefore, βαrr1−/− ipRGCs become desensitized after repeated or prolonged photostimulation. The lack of either β-arrestin attenuates ipRGC response under prolonged illumination, suggesting that β-arrestin 2-mediated deactivation and β-arrestin 1-dependent regeneration of melanopsin function in sequence. In conclusion, we discovered a molecular mechanism by which β-arrestins regulate different aspects of melanopsin photoresponses and allow ipRGC-sustained responses under prolonged illumination.

Abstract: Summary
A gain-of-function mutation in the Ca2+-activated transient receptor potential melastatin member 4 (TRPM4A432T) is linked to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbance, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. For deeper insights, we used photolysis of caged Ca2+, quantitative Ca2+, and electrophysiological measurements. TRPM4A432T’s 2-fold larger membrane current was associated with 50% decreased plasma membrane expression. Kinetic analysis unveiled 4-fold slower deactivation that was responsible for the augmented membrane current progressively rising during repetitive human cardiac action potentials. Rational mutagenesis of TRPM4 at position 432 revealed that the bulkiness of the amino acid was key to TRPM4A432T’s aberrant gating. Charged amino acids rendered the channel non-functional. The slow deactivation caused by an amino acid substitution at position 432 from alanine to the bulkier threonine represents a key contributor to the gain of function in TRPM4A432T. Thus, our results add a mechanism in the etiology of TRP channel-linked human cardiac channelopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza virus RNA polymerase (FluPol), a heterotrimer composed of PB1, PB2, and PA subunits (P3 in influenza C), performs both transcription and replication of the viral RNA genome. For transcription, FluPol interacts with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), which enables FluPol to snatch capped RNA primers from nascent host RNAs. Here, we describe the co-crystal structure of influenza C virus polymerase (FluPolC) bound to a Ser5-phosphorylated CTD (pS5-CTD) peptide. The position of the CTD-binding site at the interface of PB1, P3, and the flexible PB2 C-terminal domains suggests that CTD binding stabilizes the transcription-competent conformation of FluPol. In agreement, both cap snatching and capped primer-dependent transcription initiation by FluPolC are enhanced in the presence of pS5-CTD. Mutations of amino acids in the CTD-binding site reduce viral mRNA synthesis. We propose a model for the activation of the influenza virus transcriptase through its association with pS5-CTD of Pol II.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas13a enzymes are RNA-guided, RNA-activated RNases. Their properties have been exploited as powerful tools for RNA detection, RNA imaging, and RNA regulation. However, the relationship between target RNA binding and HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide binding) domain nuclease activation is poorly understood. Using sequencing experiments coupled with in vitro biochemistry, we find that Cas13a target RNA binding affinity and HEPN-nuclease activity are differentially affected by the number and the position of mismatches between the guide and the target. We identify a central binding seed for which perfect base pairing is required for target binding and a separate nuclease switch for which imperfect base pairing results in tight binding, but not HEPN-nuclease activation. These results demonstrate that the binding and cleavage activities of Cas13a are decoupled, highlighting a complex specificity landscape. Our findings underscore a need to consider the range of effects off-target recognition has on Cas13a RNA binding and cleavage behavior for RNA-targeting tool development.

Abstract: Summary
The yeast Candida albicans colonizes several sites in the human body and responds to metabolic signals in commensal and pathogenic states. The yeast-to-hyphae transition correlates with virulence, but how metabolic status is integrated with this transition is incompletely understood. We used the putative mitochondrial fission inhibitor mdivi-1 to probe the crosstalk between hyphal signaling and metabolism. Mdivi-1 repressed C. albicans hyphal morphogenesis, but the mechanism was independent of its presumed target, the mitochondrial fission GTPase Dnm1. Instead, mdivi-1 triggered extensive metabolic reprogramming, consistent with metabolic stress, and reduced endogenous nitric oxide (NO) levels. Limiting endogenous NO stabilized the transcriptional repressor Nrg1 and inhibited the yeast-to-hyphae transition. We establish a role for endogenous NO signaling in C. albicans hyphal morphogenesis and suggest that NO regulates a metabolic checkpoint for hyphal growth. Furthermore, identifying NO signaling as an mdivi-1 target could inform its therapeutic applications in human diseases.

Abstract: Icariside II (ICA II) is used in erectile dysfunction treatment. Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are efficient at improving erectile function. This study aimed to explore the action mechanism of ADSCs in improving erectile function. ADSCs were isolated from the adipose tissues of rats. Cell proliferation was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The expressions of mRNA and protein were determined separately through qRT-PCR and western blot. The endogenous expressions of related genes were regulated using recombinant plasmids and cell transfection. A Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay was performed to determine the interaction between miR-34a and STAT3. Rat models with bilateral cavernous nerve injuries (BCNIs) were used to assess erectile function through the detection of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracavernosal pressure (ICP). ICA II promoted ADSCs’ proliferation and differentiation to Schwann cells (SCs) through the inhibition of miR-34a. Suppressed miR-34a promoted the differentiation of ADSCs to SCs by upregulating STAT3. ICA II promoted the differentiation of ADSCs to SCs through the miR-34a/STAT3 pathway. The combination of ICA II and ADSCs preserved the erectile function of the BCNI model rats. ADSCs treated with ICA II markedly preserved the erectile function of the BCNI model rats, which was reversed through miR-34a overexpression. ICA II promotes the differentiation of ADSCs to SCs through the miR-34a/STAT3 pathway, contributing to erectile function preservation after the occurrence of a cavernous nerve injury.

Abstract: Summary
The skin functions as the primary interface between the human body and the external environment. To understand how the microbiome varies within urban mass transit and influences the skin microbiota, we profiled the human palm microbiome after contact with handrails within the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system. Intraday sampling time was identified as the primary determinant of the variation and recurrence of the community composition, whereas human-associated species and clinically important antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were captured as p.m. signatures. Line-specific signatures were notably correlated with line-specific environmental exposures and city characteristics. The sole cross-border line appeared as an outlier in most analyses and showed high relative abundance and a significant intraday increment of clinically important ARGs (24.1%), suggesting potential cross-border ARG transmission, especially for tetracycline and vancomycin resistance. Our study provides an important reference for future public health strategies to mitigate intracity and cross-border pathogen and ARG transmission.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic mutations in the appetite-regulating melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) represent the most common cause of monogenic obesity with limited treatment options. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) cause weight loss by reducing appetite. We assessed the effect of the GLP-1 RA liraglutide 3.0 mg for 16 weeks in 14 obese individuals with pathogenic MC4R mutations (BMI 37.5 ± 6.8) and 28 matched control participants without MC4R mutation (BMI 36.8 ± 4.8). Liraglutide decreased body weight by 6.8 kg ± 1.8 kg in individuals with pathogenic MC4R mutations and by 6.1 kg ± 1.2 kg in control participants. Total body fat, waist circumference, and fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations similarly decreased in both groups. Thus, liraglutide induced an equal, clinically significant weight loss of 6% in both groups, indicating that the appetite-reducing effect of liraglutide is preserved in MC4R causal obesity and that liraglutide acts independently of the MC4R pathway. Thus, liraglutide could be an effective treatment of the most common form of monogenic obesity.

Abstract: Angiogenesis must be precisely controlled because uncontrolled angiogenesis is involved in aggravation of disease symptoms. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) signaling is a key pathway leading to angiogenic responses in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Therefore, targeting VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling may be effective at modulating angiogenesis to alleviate various disease symptoms. Oleanolic acid was verified as a VEGFR-2 binding chemical from anticancer herbs with similar binding affinity as a reference drug in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3CJG of model A coordination. Oleanolic acid effectively inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 activation and angiogenesis in HU-VECs without cytotoxicity. We also verified that oleanolic acid inhibits in vivo angiogenesis during the development and the course of the retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) model in the mouse retina. Taken together, our results suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of oleanolic acid for inhibiting angiogenesis in proangiogenic diseases, including retinopathy.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial growth follows simple laws in constant conditions. However, bacteria in nature often face fluctuating environments. We therefore ask whether there are growth laws that apply to changing environments. We derive a law for upshifts using an optimal resource-allocation model: the post-shift growth rate equals the geometrical mean of the pre-shift growth rate and the growth rate on saturating carbon. We test this using chemostat and batch culture experiments, as well as previous data from several species. The increase in growth rate after an upshift indicates that ribosomes have spare capacity (SC). We demonstrate theoretically that SC has the cost of slow steady-state growth but is beneficial after an upshift because it prevents large overshoots in intracellular metabolites and allows rapid response to change. We also provide predictions for downshifts. The present study quantifies the optimal degree of SC, which rises the slower the growth rate, and suggests that SC can be precisely regulated.

Abstract: Summary
Tracking antigen-specific T cell responses over time within individuals is difficult because of lack of knowledge of antigen-specific TCR sequences, limitations in sample size, and assay sensitivities. We hypothesized that analyses of high-throughput sequencing of TCR clonotypes could provide functional readouts of individuals’ immunological histories. Using high-throughput TCR sequencing, we develop a database of TCRβ sequences from large cohorts of mice before (naive) and after smallpox vaccination. We computationally identify 315 vaccine-associated TCR sequences (VATS) that are used to train a diagnostic classifier that distinguishes naive from vaccinated samples in mice up to 9 months post-vaccination with >99% accuracy. We determine that the VATS library contains virus-responsive TCRs by in vitro expansion assays and virus-specific tetramer sorting. These data outline a platform for advancing our capabilities to identify pathogen-specific TCR sequences, which can be used to identify and quantitate low-frequency pathogen-specific TCR sequences in circulation over time with exceptional sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Despite considerable efforts, no physical mechanism has been shown to explain N-terminal codon bias in prokaryotic genomes. Using a systematic study of synonymous substitutions in two endogenous E. coli genes, we show that interactions between the coding region and the upstream Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence modulate the efficiency of translation initiation, affecting both intracellular mRNA and protein levels due to the inherent coupling of transcription and translation in E. coli. We further demonstrate that far-downstream mutations can also modulate mRNA levels by occluding the SD sequence through the formation of non-equilibrium secondary structures. By contrast, a non-endogenous RNA polymerase that decouples transcription and translation largely alleviates the effects of synonymous substitutions on mRNA levels. Finally, a complementary statistical analysis of the E. coli genome specifically implicates avoidance of intra-molecular base pairing with the SD sequence. Our results provide general physical insights into the coding-level features that optimize protein expression in prokaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Upon stress, cytoplasmic mRNA is sequestered to insoluble ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, such as the stress granule (SG). Partially due to the belief that translationally suppressed mRNAs are recruited to SGs in bulk, stress-induced dynamic redistribution of mRNA has not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we report that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress targets only a small subset of translationally suppressed mRNAs into the insoluble RNP granule fraction (RG). This subset, characterized by extended length and adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich motifs, is highly enriched with genes critical for cell survival and proliferation. This pattern of RG targeting was conserved for two other stress types, heat shock and arsenite toxicity, which induce distinct responses in the total cytoplasmic transcriptome. Nevertheless, stress-specific RG-targeting motifs, such as guanylate-cytidylate (GC)-rich motifs in heat shock, were also identified. Previously underappreciated, transcriptome profiling in the RG may contribute to understanding human diseases associated with RNP dysfunction, such as cancer and neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) undergo programmed cell death during the first postnatal week of mouse development, coincident with sustained expression of the death receptor p75NTR. Although ablation of p75NTR does not affect CGN cell death, deletion of the downstream effector RIP2 significantly increases CGN apoptosis, resulting in reduced adult CGN number and impaired behaviors associated with cerebellar function. Remarkably, CGN death is restored to basal levels when p75NTR is deleted in RIP2-deficient mice. We find that RIP2 gates the signaling output of p75NTR by competing with TRAF6 for binding to the receptor intracellular domain. In CGNs lacking RIP2, more TRAF6 is associated with p75NTR, leading to increased JNK-dependent apoptosis. In agreement with this, pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of TRAF6 restores cell death levels in CGNs lacking RIP2. These results reveal an unexpected mechanism controlling CGN number and highlight how competitive interactions govern the logic of death receptor function.

Abstract: Nandrolone decanoate is an anabolic-androgenic steroid that is frequently used at a very high dose to improve the physical performance. Recently, this drug has been abused by athletes to augment their muscle mass and improve their physical performance. However, this could have an impact on other body systems with the potential increase in its harmful effect. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of administering a supraphysiological dose of nandrolone decanoate on the hepatic functions and structure of the adult rat and to test the potential reversibility after nandrolone withdrawal. Thirty adult male rats were equally divided into; control group, nandrolone-treated group (10 mg/kg/IM/weekly) for four weeks and recovery group (received nandrolone for four weeks followed by four weeks recovery). The results showed that nandrolone treatment led to a significant increase in the body weight gain and in the levels of serum alanine and aspartate transaminases. Moreover, the liver sections from nandrolone-treated rat showed; dilatation and congestion in the blood vessels, inflammatory cellular infiltration with hepatic fibrosis, severe vacuolar cytoplasmic degeneration, apoptotic hyperchromatic nuclei and partial loss of mitochondrial cristae in the hepatocytes. In addition, nandrolone treatment resulted in significant increase in the apoptotic index and the area percentage of GFAP positive stellate cells in the liver tissues. Importantly, withdrawal of nandrolone for 4 weeks rescued these biochemical and histological changes. In conclusion, our results showed that supraphysiological dose of nandrolone has hepatotoxic effects in the adult rat and showed that these toxic effects are reversible after treatment withdrawal.

Abstract: Summary
Calorie restriction (CR) increases lifespan and improves brain health in mice. Ad libitum low-protein, high-carbohydrate (LPHC) diets also extend lifespan, but it is not known whether they are beneficial for brain health. We compared hippocampus biology and memory in mice subjected to 20% CR or provided ad libitum access to one of three LPHC diets or to a control diet. Patterns of RNA expression in the hippocampus of 15-month-old mice were similar between mice fed CR and LPHC diets when we looked at genes associated with longevity, cytokines, and dendrite morphogenesis. Nutrient-sensing proteins, including SIRT1, mTOR, and PGC1α, were also influenced by diet; however, the effects varied by sex. CR and LPHC diets were associated with increased dendritic spines in dentate gyrus neurons. Mice fed CR and LPHC diets had modest improvements in the Barnes maze and novel object recognition. LPHC diets recapitulate some of the benefits of CR on brain aging.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue (BAT) are functionally linked, as exercise increases browning via secretion of myokines. It is unknown whether BAT affects muscle function. Here, we find that loss of the transcription factor IRF4 in BAT (BATI4KO) reduces exercise capacity, mitochondrial function, ribosomal protein synthesis, and mTOR signaling in muscle and causes tubular aggregate formation. Loss of IRF4 induces myogenic gene expression in BAT, including the secreted factor myostatin, a known inhibitor of muscle function. Reducing myostatin via neutralizing antibodies or soluble receptor rescues the exercise capacity of BATI4KO mice. In addition, overexpression of IRF4 in brown adipocytes reduces serum myostatin and increases exercise capacity in muscle. Finally, mice housed at thermoneutrality have reduced IRF4 in BAT, lower exercise capacity, and elevated serum myostatin; these abnormalities are corrected by excising BAT. Collectively, our data point to an unsuspected level of BAT-muscle crosstalk driven by IRF4 and myostatin.

Abstract: Summary
Although much is known about how chromosome segregation is coupled to cell division, how intracellular organelles partition during mitotic division is poorly understood. We report that the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of the ARFGEF GBF1 regulates organelle trafficking during cell division. We show that, in mitosis, GBF1 is phosphorylated on Ser292 and Ser297 by casein kinase-2 allowing recognition by the F-box protein βTrCP. GBF1 interaction with βTrCP recruits GBF1 to the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex, triggering its degradation. Phosphorylation and degradation of GBF1 occur along microtubules at the intercellular bridge of telophase cells and are required for Golgi membrane positioning and postmitotic Golgi reformation. Indeed, expression of a non-degradable GBF1 mutant inhibits the transport of the Golgi cluster adjacent to the midbody toward the Golgi twin positioned next to the centrosome and results in defective Golgi reassembly and cytokinesis failure. These findings define a mechanism that controls postmitotic Golgi reassembly and inheritance.

Abstract: Summary
The centromere binding factor 3 (CBF3) complex binds the third centromere DNA element in organisms with point centromeres, such as S. cerevisiae. It is an essential complex for assembly of the kinetochore in these organisms, as it facilitates genetic centromere specification and allows association of all other kinetochore components. We determined high-resolution structures of the core complex of CBF3 alone and in association with a monomeric construct of Ndc10, using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). We identify the DNA-binding site of the complex and present a model in which CBF3 induces a tight bend in centromeric DNA, thus facilitating assembly of the centromeric nucleosome.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear receptors induce both transcriptional activation and repression programs responsible for development, homeostasis, and disease. Here, we report a previously overlooked enhancer decommissioning strategy underlying a large estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-dependent transcriptional repression program. The unexpected signature for this E2-induced program resides in indirect recruitment of ERα to a large cohort of pioneer factor basally active FOXA1-bound enhancers that lack cognate ERα DNA-binding elements. Surprisingly, these basally active estrogen-repressed (BAER) enhancers are decommissioned by ERα-dependent recruitment of the histone demethylase KDM2A, functioning independently of its demethylase activity. Rather, KDM2A tethers the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase NEDD4 to ubiquitylate/dismiss Pol II to abrogate eRNA transcription, with consequent target gene downregulation. Thus, our data reveal that Pol II ubiquitylation/dismissal may serve as a potentially broad strategy utilized by indirectly bound nuclear receptors to abrogate large programs of pioneer factor-mediated, eRNA-producing enhancers.

Abstract: Summary
Immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) genes are assembled by DNA rearrangements that juxtapose a variable (VH), a diversity (DH), and a joining (JH) gene segment. Here, we report that in the absence of intergenic control region 1 (IGCR1), the intronic enhancer (Eμ) associates with the next available CTCF binding site located close to VH81X via putative heterotypic interactions involving YY1 and CTCF. The alternate Eμ/VH81X loop leads to formation of a distorted recombination center and altered DH rearrangements and disrupts chromosome conformation that favors distal VH recombination. Cumulatively, these features drive highly skewed, Eμ-dependent recombination of VH81X. Sequential deletion of CTCF binding regions on IGCR1-deleted alleles suggests that they influence recombination of single proximal VH gene segments. Our observations demonstrate that Eμ interacts differently with IGCR1- or VH-associated CTCF binding sites and thereby identify distinct roles for insulator-like elements in directing enhancer activity.

Abstract: Plants have evolved strategies to cope with drought stress by maximizing physiological capacity and adjusting developmental processes such as flowering time. The WOX13 orthologous group is the most conserved among the clade of WOX homeodomain-containing proteins and is found to function in both drought stress and flower development. In this study, we isolated and characterized OsWOX13 from rice. OsWOX13 was regulated spatially in vegetative organs but temporally in flowers and seeds. Overexpression of OsWOX13 (OsWOX13-ov) in rice under the rab21 promoter resulted in drought resistance and early flowering by 7–10 days. Screening of gene expression profiles in mature leaf and panicles of OsWOX13-ov showed a broad spectrum of effects on biological processes, such as abiotic and biotic stresses, exerting a cross-talk between responses. Protein binding microarray and electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses supported ATTGATTG as the putative cis-element binding of OsWOX13. OsDREB1A and OsDREB1F, drought stress response transcription factors, contain ATTGATTG motif(s) in their promoters and are preferentially expressed in OsWOX13-ov. In addition, Heading date 3a and OsMADS14, regulators in the flowering pathway and development, were enhanced in OsWOX13-ov. These results suggest that OsWOX13 mediates the stress response and early flowering and, thus, may be a regulator of genes involved in drought escape.

Abstract: Summary
The β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex is essential for localization of surface proteins on bacterial cells, but the mechanism by which it functions is unclear. We developed a direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) methodology to view the BAM complex in situ. Single-cell analysis showed that discrete membrane precincts housing several BAM complexes are distributed across the E. coli surface, with a nearest neighbor distance of ∼200 nm. The auxiliary lipoprotein subunit BamB was crucial for this spatial distribution, and in situ crosslinking shows that BamB makes intimate contacts with BamA and BamB in neighboring BAM complexes within the precinct. The BAM complex precincts swell when outer membrane protein synthesis is maximal, visual proof that the precincts are active in protein assembly. This nanoscale interrogation of the BAM complex in situ suggests a model whereby bacterial outer membranes contain highly organized assembly precincts to drive integral protein assembly.

Abstract: Summary
While retrograde cargo selection in the Golgi is known to depend on specific signals, it is unknown whether anterograde cargo is sorted, and anterograde signals have not been identified. We suggest here that S-palmitoylation of anterograde cargo at the Golgi membrane interface is an anterograde signal and that it results in concentration in curved regions at the Golgi rims by simple physical chemistry. The rate of transport across the Golgi of two S-palmitoylated membrane proteins is controlled by S-palmitoylation. The bulk of S-palmitoylated proteins in the Golgi behave analogously, as revealed by click chemistry-based fluorescence and electron microscopy. These palmitoylated cargos concentrate in the most highly curved regions of the Golgi membranes, including the fenestrated perimeters of cisternae and associated vesicles. A palmitoylated transmembrane domain behaves similarly in model systems.

Abstract: Summary
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the primordial germ cells Z2 and Z3 are born during early embryogenesis and then held in a transcriptionally quiescent state where the genome is highly compacted. When hatched L1s feed, the germline genome decompacts, and RNAPII is abruptly and globally activated. A previously documented yet unexplained feature of germline genome activation in the worm is the appearance of numerous DNA breaks coincident with RNAPII transcription. Here, we show that the DNA breaks are induced by topoisomerase II and that they function to recruit the RUVB complex to chromosomes so that RUVB can decompact the chromatin. DNA break- and RUVB-mediated decompaction is required for zygotic genome activation. This work highlights the importance of global chromatin decompaction in the rapid induction of gene expression and shows that one way cells achieve global decompaction is through programmed DNA breaks.

Abstract: Summary
Heterochromatic repetitive satellite RNAs are extensively transcribed in a variety of human cancers, including BRCA1 mutant breast cancer. Aberrant expression of satellite RNAs in cultured cells induces the DNA damage response, activates cell cycle checkpoints, and causes defects in chromosome segregation. However, the mechanism by which satellite RNA expression leads to genomic instability is not well understood. Here we provide evidence that increased levels of satellite RNAs in mammary glands induce tumor formation in mice. Using mass spectrometry, we further show that genomic instability induced by satellite RNAs occurs through interactions with BRCA1-associated protein networks required for the stabilization of DNA replication forks. Additionally, de-stabilized replication forks likely promote the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids in cells expressing satellite RNAs. These studies lay the foundation for developing novel therapeutic strategies that block the effects of non-coding satellite RNAs in cancer cells.
