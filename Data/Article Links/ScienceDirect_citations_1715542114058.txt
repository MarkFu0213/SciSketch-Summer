Abstract: Rab3D belongs to Rab protein family. Previous reports showed that the expression of Rab3D was dysregulated in various types of cancer. Rab3D belongsRab3D belongs. However, little is known about the role of Rab3D in carcinogenesis and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we first evaluated the expression of Rab3D in 32 fresh CRC and matched normal tissues and found Rab3D was dramatically increased in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues (p<0.001). Furthermore, immunochemistry was used to investigate Rab3D expression in 300CRC tissue specimens. The expression of Rab3D significantly positively correlated with the tumor size (p=0.041), CEA level (p=0.007), tumor classification (p=0.030), lymphatic metastasis (p<0.001), distant metastasis (p=0.013) and clinical stage (p=0.003). We also demonstrated that overall survival is poor in CRC patients with high expression of Rab3D (p<0.001). Finally, we showed that Rab3D activated Akt/GSK3β/Snail pathway and induced EMT process in colorectal cancer cells. In conclusion, this study establishes increased Rab3D expression is associated with invasiveness of CRC cells, and Rab3D expression status may serve as a reliable prognostic biomarker in CRC patients.

Abstract: The theoretical approach towards improving the photovoltaic response of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunctions proposed by Knutsen et al. [Phys. Status Solidi A 210 (2013) 585–588] has been experimentally tested. AZO/n-Zn(1−x)MgxO layers were deposited at 160°C on p-Si substrates by atomic layer deposition (ALD) with magnesium concentration in the 0–4at% range. The examined devices showed a reduction of the conduction band offset from (0.63±0.03)eV to (0.48±0.03)eV. This decrease leads to a diminishing impact of recombination centers at the interface between zinc oxide based layers and silicon substrate, when the Mg content is below ~1.6at%. In this range, the overall photovoltaic efficiency increased from ~3.7% to ~6.0%. As a next step, we tested solar cells with similar magnesium concentration in the Zn(1−x)MgxO layer, but deposited at 300°C. Due to the higher deposition temperature, a further 1.1% increase in efficiency has been obtained. So far, this is the highest reported efficiency for a ZnO/Si heterojunction grown by ALD method, thus experimentally confirming the validity of the approaches here studied for raising the efficiency of heterojunctions solar cells based on n-ZnO/p-Si, while significantly reducing the fabrication complexity respect to conventional Si based devices as emphasized by Hussain et al. [Sol. Energy Mater. Sol. Cells 139 (2015) 95–100].

Abstract: Thin-film silicon tandem (MICROMORPH™) module design optimization process for performance maximization is described together with an analysis of some key reliability topics. In the first part, the procedure for module layout optimization to achieve the maximum module power output is described. In monolithic thin-film modules the layout is realized through a laser scribing interconnection process: a well-controlled laser scribing process is therefore essential to ensure optimal module performance and to minimize unwanted losses. The second part of the paper focuses on some of the materials used in the fabrication of a solar cell and module of such technology and the processes used to achieve such module assembly, as well as a description of some of the possible failure modes. Special attention is paid to the zinc oxide transparent conductive oxide (ZnO TCO) layers used for the front and back contacts. The bottom cell (BoCe) and its stability is also analyzed in detail: the influence of process parameters on the BoCe degradation behavior including the differences observed using different thin-film silicon (TF-Si) deposition reactor types, different lamination foils and the impact using different front contact haze is discussed. In the final part of the paper the effect of particle contamination on the module performance is reviewed: specifically contamination by particles generated during deposition and handling processes. Finally relevant countermeasures to prevent additional module performance loss are discussed.

Abstract: A simple and inexpensive solution process has been developed to construct a silver film with enhanced adhesion by electroless plating for solar reflector applications. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) were employed to characterize the surfaces. This reinforced adhesion is due to chemical covalent bonds between silver and substrate atoms. Silver maintains its unique conductivity even as a film on the ABS surface as demonstrated by four-point probe measurement. Moreover, UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer data confirms high reflectance of the Ag films in the infrared region indicating potential application for solar coatings. The method presented a convenient, compatible, and easily scalable manufacturing process with higher efficiency, which is of significant value for industrial fabrication of silver films and could have a promising future in concentrating solar systems.

Abstract: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in tumor progression and metastasis as a crucial event for cancer cells to trigger the metastatic niche. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been shown to play an important role as an EMT inducer in various stages of carcinogenesis. Previous reports had shown that antitumor vanadium inhibits the metastatic potential of tumor cells by reducing MMP-2 expression and inducing ROS-dependent apoptosis. However, the role of vanadium in (TGF-β)-induced EMT remains unclear. In the present study, we report for the first time on the inhibitory effects of vanadium on (TGF-β)-mediated EMT followed by down-regulation of ex vivo cancer stem cell markers. The results demonstrate blockage of (TGF-β)-mediated EMT by vanadium and reduction in the mitochondrial potential of tumor cells linked to EMT and cancer metabolism. Furthermore, combination of vanadium and carboplatin (a) resulted in synergistic antitumor activity in ex vivo cell cultures, and (b) prompted G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and sensitization of tumor cells to carboplatin-induced apoptosis. Overall, the findings highlight the multifaceted antitumor action of vanadium and its synergistic antitumor efficacy with current chemotherapy drugs, knowledge that could be valuable for targeting cancer cell metabolism and cancer stem cell-mediated metastasis in aggressive chemoresistant tumors.

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinases are a family of zinc endopeptidases with proteolytic activity against the extracellular matrix components. In particular, two members of this family named Gelatinase A and B, as amply documented in the literature, play a key role in the process of tumor growth/metastasis in breast and hepatocellular carcinoma. Their activity is regulated by Tissue Inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 and −2, which are the physiological inhibitor of Gelatinases A and B respectively. The aim of this review is to determine the current understanding of the clinical and prognostic role of Metalloproteinases-2 and −9 and their inhibitors in the course of breast cancer and liver diseases. Forty-one articles were selected from PubMed by entering the following keywords: liver diseases, breast cancer, MMP-2, TIMP-2; all articles were read and notes were made regarding the number of enrolled patients, pathology, measures, results and these data were used to write this review. Over-expression of both gelatinases is associated with the relapse of disease, metastasis, shorter overall survival in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma and invasion and progression to tumors in chronic liver diseases, and MMPs/TIMPs ratio could be useful in the follow-up of these patients.

Abstract: This paper presents a field-trial of organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology used within a practical application for rural electrification in Rwanda. Fourteen, large area, flexible, ITO-free, roll-to-roll processed OPV modules, encapsulated with low-cost materials, were installed on corrugated steel roofs at two sites in a rural village in Southern Rwanda and subject to continuous monitoring. This field-trial exposed modules to very high levels of insolation, in particular in the UV, high temperatures and heavy rainfall. Results show that the modules exhibit practical lifetimes (to degrade by 20% of their initial capacity) of between 2½ and 5 months, a value 5–6 times lower than control modules kept both in the dark and outdoors in Roskilde, Denmark. Degradation was primarily the result of extensive delamination caused by failure of the non-UV stable encapsulation, which led to decay in the FF, Voc and Isc of the module.

Abstract: Background
Achieving a high rate of complete pathological response with pre-operative chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer is an unmet need. We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of cetuximab, capecitabine and radiation therapy in the pre-operative setting of localized rectal cancer.
Patients and methods
Patients with clinically staged T3, T4 or nodepositive rectal cancer were treated with concurrent capecitabine and radiotherapy with weekly cetuximab starting one week before the start of radiation. This was followed by total mesorectal excision within 6-8 weeks. All patients achieving R0 resection received adjuvant capecitabine for 6 cycles.
Results
Fifteen patients were treated and all underwent surgery. Sphincter preservation was achieved in 11 patients (73.3%) and pathological complete response in two. With a median follow up of 48 months (range 8.4-57.5), 12 patients were relapse-free and 14 were alive with 4-year relapse free survival of 80%. Overall survival was 93%. Significant grade 3 and 4 toxicity was mainly cetuximab-induced skin reactions (33%), radiation-induced skin toxicity (13%) and diarrhea (20%).
Conclusions
Adding cetuximab to pre-operative concurrent capecitabine and radiotherapy provides modest efficacy with manageable toxicity.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to develop a stable water emulsion-based phase change material (PCM), with low viscosity, for solar thermal applications. The effects of different non-ionic emulsifiers, including nine kinds of binary mixtures of Tweens and Spans, on the droplet diameter distribution, the apparent viscosity and the stability of the emulsions, were evaluated. There appeared to be an effective range for both the emulsifier concentration and the dispersed phase PCM content to maintain the stability and the fluidity of the emulsions. The emulsification process also played an important role in controlling the size distribution of the PCM droplets in the emulsions. Thermal analysis by differential scanning calorimetry indicated that the degree of supercooling of the emulsion increased with the droplet size decline and that dispersed nano SiO2 particles were effective as a nucleating agent to reduce supercooling. Multiple phase transitions were observed in the melting and the crystallisation processes of the PCM. The rheology characteristics and the long-term storage stability of the emulsions were also investigated and are discussed.

Abstract: Thermochromic windows are able to modulate their transmittance in both the visible and the near-infrared field as a function of their temperature. As a consequence, they allow to control the solar gains in summer, thus reducing the energy needs for space cooling. However, they may also yield a reduction in the daylight availability, which results in the energy consumption for indoor artificial lighting being increased. This paper investigates, by means of dynamic simulations, the application of thermochromic windows to an existing office building in terms of energy savings on an annual basis, while also focusing on the effects in terms of daylighting and thermal comfort. In particular, due attention is paid to daylight availability, described through illuminance maps and by the calculation of the daylight factor, which in several countries is subject thresholds. The study considers both a commercially available thermochromic pane and a series of theoretical thermochromic glazing. The expected performance is compared to static clear and reflective insulating glass units. The simulations are repeated in different climatic conditions, showing that the overall energy savings compared to clear glazing can range from around 5% for cold climates to around 20% in warm climates, while not compromising daylight availability. Moreover the role played by the transition temperature of the pane is examined, pointing out an optimal transition temperatures that is irrespective of the climatic conditions.

Abstract: An empirical dependence of the short circuit current density Jsc as a function of the dark saturation current density J01 is proposed, which describes this dependence down to a bulk lifetime of 1ns. This method avoids artifacts, which appear when applying the previously proposed quadratic dependence. The parameters of the new dependence are fitted to PC1D simulations and to experimental LBIC results for various wavelengths and AM 1.5 for a typical industrial BSF-type solar cell and a PERC cell. This dependence can also be used to calculate J01 images from LBIC-based Jsc images. It turns out that this method is more reliable in BSF than in PERC cells.

Abstract: Grain interiors (GIs) and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskites have been investigated using chemically, spatially, and temporally resolved measurements. Two dimensional (2D) chemical mapping measurements revealed the GBs consisted of the non-stoichiometric PbIx or CH3NH3PbIx, that were characterized by an absence of chloride, an enriched oxygen concentration, and a high density of iodide vacancies. In addition, steady-state 2D photoluminescence showed the bandgap broadening at the GBs while 2D lifetime mapping measurement suggested that the GBs indeed contained deep defect centers. However, it is found that defective GBs in perovskite materials do not act as high recombination sites for photogenerated charge carriers due to the bandgap broadening of non-stoichiometric PbIx or CH3NH3PbIx perovskites at the GB that forms the potential barriers for photo-generated charge carriers toward the GBs. As a consequence, the photo-generated charge carriers adjacent to the GBs will be easily repelled by the GBs, resulting in a greater reduction of the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. This is one possible reason for the high performance of CH3HN3PbI3-xClx based solar cells.

Abstract: In this study, we evaluated the colloidal stability of gold nanorods (with positive, negative and neutral surface charge) in solution upon contact with excised human skin. UV–vis absorption, plasmon peak broadening index (PPBI%) and transmission electron microscope analysis were used to follow nanoparticles aggregation in solution. Our results show that positively charged gold nanorods aggregate extensively upon exposure to excised human skin compared to negatively and neutrally charged gold nanorods. Skin-induced aggregation of cationic gold nanorods was linked to the adsorption of proteins released from the dermis layer to the surface of gold nanorods. Protein adsorption significantly screen nanorod’s effective surface charge and induce their aggregation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the presence of polyethylene glycol polymer on the surface of cationic gold nanorods minimize this aggregation significantly by providing steric repulsion (non-electrostatic stabilization mechanism). This work highlights the importance of evaluating the colloidal stability of nanoparticles in solution upon contact with skin, which is a “usually overlooked” parameter when studying the nanoparticle-skin interaction.

Abstract: ITO thin films were deposited on flexible fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) substrates by pulsed direct current reactive magnetron sputtering system using an In:Sn (90%–10% wt.) alloy target. The influence of the deposition parameters (argon and oxygen flow rates, and substrate temperature) and effect of coating thickness on the optical, electrical, structural and microstructural properties of ITO thin films deposited on FEP was investigated. The thickness of the ITO coatings was varied from 5 to 180nm. The optimized ITO coating (10nm thick) exhibited high IR emittance (79%) on FEP substrate with high average solar transmittance (94.0%) and moderate sheet resistance (3kΩ/sq.). We also investigated in detail the angular dependence of reflectance as well as haze factor of thin ITO coatings. Our results suggest that 10nm thick ITO coating exhibits an average haze factor of 8.6%. The high value of IR emittance, moderate sheet resistance and high solar transmittance along with low haze factor indicate the suitability of ITO thin films on FEP substrates as flexible optical solar reflector for space applications.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on the role of miR-135a in biological processes, very little attention has been paid to the regulation of its transcription. We have previously reported that miR-135a suppresses 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis by directly targeting the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and activating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, but the regulatory elements that regulate the expression of the two isoforms of miR-135a (miR-135a-1 and miR-135a-2) remain poorly understood. Here, by using deletion analysis, we predicted two binding sites (−874/−856 and −2020/−2002) for the transcription factor Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 5a (STAT5a) within the core promoters of miR-135a-1 and miR-135a-2 (−1128/−556 and −2264/−1773), and the subsequent site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the two STAT5a binding sites regulated the activity of the miR-135a-1 and miR-135a-2 promoters. The binding of STAT5a to the miR-135a-1/2 core promoters in vitro and in cell culture was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Overexpression and RNAi knockdown of STAT5a showed that the transcription factor regulated the endogenous miR-135a expression. Additionally, The expression time frame of STAT5a and APC indicated a potential negative feedback between them. In sum, the overall results from this study indicate that STAT5a regulates miR-135a transcription by binding to both miR-135a-1 and miR135a-2 promoter elements and the findings provide novel insights into the molecular regulatory mechanisms of miR-135a during adipogenesis.

Abstract: In this work, the benefits of Ag-alloying in kesterite solar cells are explored in terms of tunable band gap, improved grain growth, improved minority carrier lifetime, reduced defect formation, and reduced potential fluctuations for (Ag,Cu)2ZnSnSe4 (ACZTSe) absorbers relative to Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe). The enhanced optoelectronic properties are shown to scale here with the degree of Ag-alloying in ACZTSe. The impacts of these effects on device performance are discussed, with improvement in average device performance/open-circuit voltage reported for ACZTSe (5%-Ag) absorbers relative to CZTSe absorbers with similar band gap. These initial results are promising for the Ag-alloyed ACZTSe material system as VOC limitations are the primary cause of poor device performance in kesterite solar cells, and cation substitution presents a unique method to tune the defect properties of kesterite absorbers. Herein, nanoparticle synthesis and large-grain ACZTSe absorber formation is described followed by material and optoelectronic characterization. Additionally, RTP processing is presented to achieve fully selenized large-grain chalcogenide absorbers from sulfide nanocrystal inks.

Abstract: Building-Integrated Concentrated Photovoltaic (BICPV) systems integrate easily into built environments, replacing building material, providing benefits of generating electricity at the point of use, allowing light efficacy within the building envelope and providing thermal management. This paper presents a novel experimental evaluation of phase change materials (PCM) to enhance performance of low-concentration BICPV system via thermal regulation. Previous studies have primarily focussed on temporal and spatial studies of PCM temperature within the BIPV systems but the current work also discusses the effect of PCM on electrical parameters of the BICPV systems. Due to the inadequacy of the earlier reported model, a new analytical model is proposed and implemented with the in-house controlled experiments. Paraffin wax based RT42 was used within an in-house designed and fabricated PCM containment. An indoor experiment was performed using highly collimated continuous light source at 1000Wm−2. Results show an increase in relative electrical efficiency by 7.7% with PCM incorporation. An average reduction in module centre temperature by 3.8°C was recorded in the BICPV–PCM integrated system as compared to the naturally ventilated system without PCM. Studies showed that PCM effectiveness varies with irradiance; an increase in relative electrical efficiency by 1.15% at 500Wm−2, 4.20% at 750Wm−2 and 6.80% at 1200Wm−2 was observed.

Abstract: Prion is a unique nucleic acid-free pathogen that causes human and animal fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a prototypic neurotrophin that helps to support the survival of existing neurons, and encourage the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses through axonal and dendritic sprouting. There are two distinct classes of glycosylated receptors, neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR) and tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk), that can bind to BDNF. To obtain insights into the possible alterations of brain BDNF and its signaling pathway in prion disease, the levels of BDNF and several molecules in the BDNF pathway in the brain tissues of scrapie agents 263K-infected hamsters were separately evaluated. Western blots and/or immunohistochemical (IHC) assays revealed that BDNF, TrkB, GRB2 and p75NTR, were significantly downregulated in the brain tissues of scrapie-infected rodents at terminal stage. Double-stained immunofluorescent assay (IFA) demonstrated that BDNF and phospho-TrkB predominately expressed in neurons. Dynamic analyses of the brain samples collected at the different time-points during the incubation period illustrated continuous decreases of BDNF, TrkB, phospho-TrkB, GRB2 and p75NTR, which correlated well with neuron loss. However, these proteins remained almost unchanged in the prion infected cell line SMB-S15 compared with those of its normal cell line SMB-PS. These data suggest that the BDNF signaling pathway is severely hindered in the brains of prion disease, which may contribute, at least partially, to the neuron death.

Abstract: In this work, the objective is to develop a simple approach for the prediction of temperature and electrical efficiency of a PV panel. This modeling work constitutes a basic task towards better understanding of the behavior and capabilities of a PV panel when it is subjected to changing meteorological conditions. Different approaches may be used to determine the thermal response of a PV panel depending on the level of details needed for the temperature distribution. For a through-thickness temperature distribution, a one dimensional analysis is necessary. Therefore, only a one-dimensional finite difference model is proposed. Three different formulations of boundary conditions were used and compared in the numerical simulations. To build a full approach for thermal and efficiency analysis, the proposed thermal model is coupled with a solar radiation model and an electrical model. The parameters of the electrical model were estimated by the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Numerical simulations were performed with the meteorological inputs from Ajaccio (France) and for a commercial PV panel BP 350U. The predictions were compared to existing models and to experimental results.

Abstract: We report and explain the photoluminescence (PL) spectra from crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers passivated by hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films under various measurement conditions, utilizing the different absorption coefficients and radiative recombination mechanisms in c-Si and a-Si:H. By comparison with the luminescence properties of a-Si:H, we also demonstrate that SiNx films deposited under certain silicon-rich conditions yield luminescence spectra similar to those of a-Si:H, indicating the presence of an a-Si:H-like phase in the SiNx films. This causes a reduction in the blue response of the solar cells via parasitic absorption. In addition, with the ability to detect the specific emission from heavily-doped silicon via band-gap narrowing effects, we can unambiguously separate individual spectral PL signatures of three different layers in a single substrate: the SiNx passivation films, the diffused layers, and the underlying c-Si substrate. Finally, we apply this technique to evaluate parasitic absorption in the passivation films, and the doping density of the diffused layers on different finished solar cells, highlighting the value of this nondestructive contactless, micron-scale technique for photovoltaic applications.

Mefunidone ameliorates renal inflammation and tubulointerstitial fibrosis via suppression of IKKβ phosphorylation,

Abstract: Mefunidone is a new pyridone agent that attenuates renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. However, the signaling pathways involved in the effect of mefunidone on renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis have not been well explained. Inflammatory response initiates and promotes renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase beta (IKKβ) is a master regulator of inflammation. This study is determined to clarify the influence of mefunidone on renal inflammation and the phosphorylation of IKKβ. Experimental renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis was induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) for 3, 7 and 14days in sprague dawley rat. Treatment with mefunidone was conducted simultaneously. Obstructed kidneys were harvested for the assessment. Our results showed that treatment with mefunidone ameliorated renal inflammatory injury, renal tubular lesions and interstitial fibrosis. Further studies indicated that treatment with mefunidone mitigated the expressions of tumor necrosis factorα (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the kidney. The phosphorylation of IKKβ and inhibitor of kappa-B (IκB) and the expression of NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NALP3) were also reduced in vivo after treatment with mefunidone. In vitro, peritoneal macrophages were incubated with necrotic cells or lipopolysaccharide in the presence or absence of mefunidone. Mefunidone markedly decreased necrotic cell or LPS induced IL-1β production and LPS induced TNFα production in primary peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, mefunidone significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of IKKβ/IκB and nuclear transition of NF-κB p65 in peritoneal macrophages stimulated by necrotic cell or lipopolysaccharide. In conclusion, mefunidone serves as a novel anti-inflammatory agent that attenuates UUO-induced renal interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, possibly through suppressing IKKβ phosphorylation.

Abstract: Kesterite quaternary semiconductor Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanocrystals were successfully prepared via a relatively simple electrospinning route and characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Semiconductor Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanofibers were obtained for PVB/ Cu2ZnSnSe4 precursor at an applied voltage of 20kV after annealing treatment at 500°C for 2h. The optical property of Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanocrystals was also recorded by means of UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. It was shown that the dimension effect of composites could be enhanced by increasing the electrospinning conditions (voltage, distances, concentrations, viscosity) and the CZTSe nanofibers prepared at annealing process exhibited more intense optical properties. Temperature dependent studies were conducted and the annealing of composites was found to be the key factor in determining the phase formation.

Abstract: Over one billion people lack access to electricity and many of them in rural areas far from existing infrastructure. Off-grid systems can provide an alternative to extending the grid network and using renewable energy, for example solar photovoltaics (PV) and battery storage, can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from electricity that would otherwise come from fossil fuel sources. This paper presents a model capable of comparing several mature and emerging PV technologies for rural electrification with diesel generation and grid extension for locations in India in terms of both the levelised cost and lifecycle emissions intensity of electricity. The levelised cost of used electricity, ranging from $0.46–1.20/kWh, and greenhouse gas emissions are highly dependent on the PV technology chosen, with battery storage contributing significantly to both metrics. The conditions under which PV and storage becomes more favourable than grid extension are calculated and hybrid systems of PV, storage and diesel generation are evaluated. Analysis of expected price evolutions suggest that the most cost-effective hybrid systems will be dominated by PV generation around 2018.

Abstract: Low temperature (100 and 250°C) post-deposition annealings were applied to Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) absorbers to modify the ordering degree of the kesterite. Spectrophotometry and photoluminescence revealed a blue or red shift of the band gap and the luminescence peak after ordering or disordering post-treatments, respectively. For most solar cells, the open circuit voltage was found to be limited by bulk recombination and to follow band gap variations, leading to a constant open circuit voltage deficit. For the range of ordering degree investigated, the large open circuit voltage deficit, typically encountered in kesterite solar cells, could not be attributed to disorder. Capacitance–voltage measurements demonstrated that the net carrier concentration of ordered CZTSe is reduced by one order of magnitude compared to disordered CZTSe. Besides its beneficial effects on the open circuit voltage, the ordering post-treatment was also found to increase the collection of photo-generated carriers, resulting in a high current density and a significant improvement in device efficiency.

Abstract: In photovoltaics, the quality of the polymeric solar cell embedding material is of key importance for the long-term durability and performance of the PV modules. For the most common encapsulant, elastomeric ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), the degree of crosslinking is a key issue in this respect. Raman spectroscopy was researched as a fully contact-free, truly non-destructive optical method to measure the degree of EVA crosslinking of bare EVA film samples as well as in-situ inside assembled PV modules. The method relies on evaluating subtle but characteristic spectral differences in the CH-stretching vibration region (3.000–2.800cm−1) that correlate directly, unambiguously and reliably to the crosslinking state of the EVA encapsulant. With measurement times below one second per analysis point, the method is suitable for real-time, in-line quality control. Using a self-referencing data evaluation approach, the method could be designed to be widely immune to real-world effects, including different sample reflectivity and instrument drifts. Involving the reaction kinetics of the curing reaction, the Raman data can be converted into crosslinking readings that equal the traditional, Soxhlet-derived gel content values. The method has been successfully validated for bare foils, glass–backsheet and glass–glass modules with three different EVA types and deployed in-line in a commercial PV module manufacturing line. Using Raman spectroscopy, it is thus possible to determine the degree of crosslinking of the EVA encapsulant inside assembled modules in-line and with high accuracy, even on moving modules.

Abstract: Low open circuit voltage (Voc) values have been widely reported in kesterite Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe)-based thin film solar cells. So far, a complete understanding of the main sources of these low performances is far from clear. In this work, a theoretical model for CZTSe solar cell with record efficiency is presented. Among the different device loss mechanisms, trap-assisted tunneling recombination is introduced as the major hurdle to boost Voc values. Detailed comparison of the simulation results to the measured device parameters shows that our model is able to reproduce the experimental observations. Finally, it is found that a further solar cell efficiency enhancement of up to 19.4% with an open circuit voltage close to 708mV can be achieved by using more resistive CdS layers which is in contradiction to p–n junction behavior. In this way, a MIS performance is proposed to promote Voc and efficiency values. As a result, this approach could help to solve at least one of the main issues of this technology.

Abstract: Both an Al0.3Ga0.7As heterojunction in the p-type emitter and a bandgap-graded layer in the n-type light absorbing base were employed in the GaAs-based solar cells. The simulation by AFORS-HET (Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin) confirmed that the Al0.3Ga0.7As heterojunction enhanced the open-circuit voltage (Voc) by ~2%, and the n-type bandgap grading increased the fill factor by ~1%, respectively. The increased power conversion efficiency by ~3% supported the simulation results. An additional efficiency gain was obtained by the shape optimization of the band bending in the 80-nm compositional profile, increasing Voc up to 1.103V. The cell with the anti-reflective coating exhibited high performance with a power conversion efficiency of 28.7% under 1sun illumination, close to the world record of 28.8%.

Abstract: Self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QD) in a GaAs1−xSbx matrix are studied using photoluminescence. Increasing the Sb composition in the GaAs1−xSbx matrix reduces the effective band gap while lowering the valence band offset, resulting in transition from a type-I to type-II band alignment for Sb compositions above 14%. The optimized quantum dots are incorporated in an InAs/GaAs1−xSbx based p–i–n solar cell with a degenerate valence band and therefore optimum intermediate band structure. Temperature dependent external quantum efficiency measurements show an enhancement in the QDs region with increasing temperature.

Abstract: Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction is associated with increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Current evidence suggests a protective role of thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is unknown yet a putative role of Trx1 in sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction, in which oxidative stress is an underlying cause. Transgenic male mice with Trx1 cardiac-specific overexpression (Trx1-Tg) and its wild-type control (wt) were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture or sham surgery. After 6, 18, and 24h, cardiac contractility, antioxidant enzymes, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Trx1 overexpression improved the average life expectancy (Trx1-Tg: 36, wt: 28h; p=0.0204). Sepsis induced a decrease in left ventricular developed pressure in both groups, while the contractile reserve, estimated as the response to β-adrenergic stimulus, was higher in Trx1-Tg in relation to wt, after 6h of the procedure. Trx1 overexpression attenuated complex I inhibition, protein carbonylation, and loss of membrane potential, and preserved Mn superoxide dismutase activity at 24h. Ultrastructural alterations in mitochondrial cristae were accompanied by reduced optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) fusion protein, and activation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) (fission protein) in wt mice at 24h, suggesting mitochondrial fusion/fission imbalance. PGC-1α gene expression showed a 2.5-fold increase in Trx1-Tg at 24h, suggesting mitochondrial biogenesis induction. Autophagy, demonstrated by electron microscopy and increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, was observed earlier in Trx1-Tg. In conclusion, Trx1 overexpression extends antioxidant protection, attenuates mitochondrial damage, and activates mitochondrial turnover (mitophagy and biogenesis), preserves contractile reserve and prolongs survival during sepsis.

Abstract: Solar reflectors for concentrating solar power applications can be subject to performance losses due to their permanent exposure to the environment. There is still lack of experience regarding the destructive effects of sand and dust storms on reflector materials and no accelerated ageing guideline is formulated yet to account for the performance loss of solar mirrors due to particle erosion to a realistic extent. The work described here shows one approach to design an accelerated ageing test setup that simulates erosion processes on solar reflectors based on DIN 52348 standard. Furthermore, the results of the developed laboratory ageing method were compared with the effects on exposed outdoor samples from Zagora (Morocco). Laboratory experiments demonstrated a linear correlation between the amount of sand, which is used to erode the reflector samples and their specular reflectance loss. As well, the dependence of the impact angle on the severeness of erosion was investigated. The results are in agreement with earlier works where it was determined that erosion damage on brittle materials like glass is most pronounced for perpendicular impact and becomes weaker for decreasing impact angles. Four different silvered-glass mirrors and three different aluminium mirrors were investigated. Using the results from the laboratory experiments it was possible to attribute defect rates to the respective reflector materials and rank them regarding the resistance towards erosion, specific for this setup. All tested silvered-glass mirrors showed higher erosion resistance than the aluminium samples. The conducted microscope comparison between outdoor exposed samples and those tested under laboratory conditions prove that the developed method for accelerated ageing tests provokes realistic erosion damage.

Abstract: Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) plays a crucial role in the melanogenesis and proliferation of melanocytes that is dependent on its abundance and modification. Here, we report that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces senescence and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) expression that is related to MITF. We found that MITF could bind TP53 to regulate CDKN1A. Furthermore, the interaction between MITF and TP53 is dependent on AKT activity. We found that AKT phosphorylates MITF at S510. Phosphorylated MITF S510 enhances its affinity to TP53 and promotes CDKN1A expression. Meanwhile, the unphosphorylative MITF promotes TYR expression. The levels of p-MITF-S510 are low in 90% human melanoma samples. Thus the level of p-MITF-S510 could be a possible diagnostic marker for melanoma. Our findings reveal a mechanism for regulating MITF functions in response to EGF stimulation and suggest a possible implementation for preventing the over proliferation of melanoma cells.

Abstract: Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) layers deposited by sputtering and boron-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:B) layers deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) are well-established materials for front electrodes in thin-film silicon solar cells. In this study, both types of front electrodes are evaluated with respect to their inherent properties and their surface textures in micromorph tandem solar cells in the superstrate configuration. The silicon layer stack investigated here consists of a 220-nm-thick amorphous silicon top cell, a 40-nm-thick intermediate reflector and a 1.1-µm-thick microcrystalline silicon bottom cell; for this specific silicon layer stack, the LPCVD ZnO:B provides higher power conversion efficiency than its sputtered ZnO:Al counterpart. The growth-friendly surface topography of ZnO:Al yields better electrical performance. However, tandem cells on ZnO:Al suffer from a fundamental optical limitation in terms of light trapping in the top cell. They also show a higher parasitic absorption linked to the relatively high doping concentration of the ZnO:Al layers used here. Detailed analysis of the experimental results allows us to clearly understand the opto-electrical behavior of both types of cells and envisage several possible upgrades to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as an alternative photovoltaic technology reaching record certified efficiencies of 20.1% in only 6 years. Film morphology and crystalline structure of the perovskite are crucial factors to determine the final photovoltaic performance. In this work, the thermal transitions occurring during the crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite were revealed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Particularly, the calorimetric analysis suggest that an annealing temperature around 130°C drives to better ordered perovskite structures as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Indeed, the photovoltaic performance of the devices developed at such optimal temperature reached 8.7% average PCE which is in the state-of-the-art for the considered pin planar PSC. Our experimental observations highlight the relevance of DSC as a powerful tool to determine in situ the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx optimal crystallization conditions. This analysis provides a better understanding of the physical processes occurring during the perovskite crystallization and has the potential to be applied in the optimization of novel photovoltaic materials and structures.

The pure 1D brookite TiO2 nanoneedles of ~650nm long and ~30nm wide were synthesized via hot-filament metal-oxide vapor deposition. X-ray diffractometry analysis revealed the pure 1D brookite TiO2 nanoneedles to be in orthorhombic crystalline form within space group Pbca. The excellent electrochromic characteristics, including the stable and reversible coloration–bleaching cycles, and fair diffusion coefficient (~1.56×10−11cm2/s), high reversibility (~99%), great coloration efficiency (226cm2/C), high optical transmittance difference (~67%), large optical density (0.85), and fast coloration and bleaching times (13.10 and 5.14s) at a wavelength of 600nm, make the pure 1D brookite TiO2 nanoneedles very good materials for use in smart windows.

Abstract: A novel AlCrSiN/AlCrSiON/AlCrO tandem multi-layer nanocomposite coating has been prepared by cathodic arc ion plating for solar selective absorbing. The composition, structure, and surface morphology of the coating were characterized using SEM, EDS, XPS, TEM, and AFM. The optical performances of the coating were measured by spectrophotometer, while the thermal stability of the coating was evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. The coating exhibited a relatively high absorptance of 0.958 and a relatively low emittance of 0.14, as well as an outstanding thermal stability with a selectivity of 0.924/0.16 even after annealing at 600°C for 600h in air, which properties rendered this multi-layer nanocomposite coating a potential material for photo-thermal conversion at high temperatures.

Abstract: The low density of silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) in a dielectric matrix is one of the plausible reasons for the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Si QD solar cells due to large spacing between QD and substrate. In this study, the electrical properties of the Si QD layers were improved by increasing the density of Si QDs and reducing the barrier width. In the previous studies, Si QD layers were fabricated by alternating deposition of SiO2/SiOx layers and subsequent high temperature (1100°C) annealing, where the diffusion of Si species in the SiOx layer into Si substrate was observed. In order to prevent the diffusion, we propose the substitution of the SiOx layer with an amorphous Si (a-Si) layer. In [SiO2 (2nm)/SiOx (2nm)]×34 multilayer structures, the first few SiOx layers were substituted with a-Si layers. As a result, Si QDs could be well formed in the a-Si layer with high density and survived near the interfaces between the first Si QD layer and Si substrate. The distance of the nearest Si QDs from the Si substrates was also reduced from 7.2nm to 3.6nm, which results in the effective carrier transfer by tunneling between the Si QDs. The PCE of heterojunction B-doped Si QDs/crystalline Si solar cells was enhanced by using the Si QD structures with the improved electrical properties. Since the variations of open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current are not so large, the enhancement of PCE is mainly related with the improvement of fill factor due to the decrease of series resistance.

Abstract: We present structural and optical spectroscopy studies of thin films of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) with strong copper deficiency deposited on Mo/Glass substrates and selenised at 450, 500 or 550°C. Solar cells fabricated from these films demonstrated efficiencies up to 7.4% for selenisation at 500°C. Structural analysis based on X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy revealed the presence of SnSe2 in the film selenised at 450°C but not in the films selenised at higher temperatures. A progressive decrease of the Sn and Se content was observed as the selenisation temperature increased. Photoluminescence excitation was used to determine the bandgaps at 4.2K. Detailed measurements of the temperature and excitation intensity dependencies of the photoluminescence spectra allow the recombination mechanisms of the observed emission bands to be identified as band-to-impurity and band-to-band transitions, and their evolution with selenisation temperature changes to be analysed. The strongest band-to-band transition is recorded in the PL spectra of the film selenised at 500°C and can be observed from 6K to room temperature. The compositional and structural changes in the films and their influence on the optoelectronic properties of CZTSe and solar cells are discussed.

Abstract: It is promising that the efficiency of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) based heterojunction solar cell can be improved by inserting a buffer layer to mediate the energy alignment at the interface. In this work, a sulfur-doped ZnO (ZnOS) buffer layer with properly tuned band alignment was introduced to the Cu2O heterojunction solar cell with Al-doped ZnO (AZO) as the n-type transparent conductive oxide layer to form an interfacial energy barrier, which improved the open-circuit voltage extremely. The experimental parameters including the oxygen pressure, buffer layer thickness and the deposition temperature were optimized. The mechanism of buffer layer was investigated, which revealed the rise of conduction band minimum of ZnOS buffer layer, thereby mitigating the interfacial recombination. This work shed light on the optimization of the interfacial band alignment of heterojunction solar cell, improving the photoresponse property.

Abstract: We report solution processed pristine diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based polymer (PDPP3T) as hole transport layer (HTL) for perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells. The pristine PDPP3T based perovskite solar cells achieved comparable photovoltaic performance (12.32%) as that (12.34%) of doped spiro-OMeTAD based cells. After exposing to air having 40% relative humidity at room temperature, PDPP3T based perovskite solar cells showed much slower degradation than spiro-OMeTAD cells. The PDPP3T based devices showed an efficiency decrease by 26.6% after being in air for 73h and 60.6% for 172h, while the spiro-OMeTAD cells exhibited a much larger efficiency decrease of 41.4% for 73h and 82.9% for 172h. The use of pristine PDPP3T does not require processing HTL in air and adding any additives such as lithium salt dissolved in acetonitrile, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), which are needed for the spiro-OMeTAD HTL preparation. This prevents exposure of the perovskite layer to ambient air and avoids corrosion of perovskite layer by acetonitrile solvent and formation of PbI2.xTBP complex which leads to slow down the cell degradation and improves device stability.

Abstract: Patterning of kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4 or CZTS) thin films by the inkjet printing technique has been demonstrated for the first time. For the ink formulation, CZTS nanoparticles were obtained in large quantities using a continuous-flow synthesis based on microwave-assisted heating of a mixture of mercaptoacetic acid, sodium sulfide, tin chloride, copper and zinc acetates dissolved in water. For the further formulation of a stable nanoparticle ink with rheological and wetting properties suitable for inkjet pattering on Mo/SLG substrates, a mixture of methyl-ethyl-ketone (MEK) and dodecanthiol (DDT) with the volume ratio MEK:DDT=9:1 was used as a solvent. It has been shown that the same ink can be successfully used for the preparation of thin films by spray-coating technique. Deposition of the nanoparticle ink by both methods followed by annealing at 540°C in a sulfur-containing atmosphere allowed obtaining crystalline thin films of kesterite with the desired (copper poor and zinc rich) chemical composition. The process developed in the present study is promising for a low-cost non-vacuum production of thin films of CZTS which is expected to serve as a substitute for the solar absorber materials based on rare and toxic elements.

Abstract: Deprivation for the single amino acid arginine is a rapidly developing metabolic anticancer therapy, which allows growth control in a number of highly malignant tumors. Here we report that one of the responses of human solid cancer cells to arginine starvation is the induction of prolonged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Systematic study of two colorectal carcinoma HCT-116 and HT29, glioblastoma U251 MG and ovarian carcinoma SKOV3 cell lines revealed, however, that the ER stress triggered by the absence of arginine does not result in massive apoptosis despite a profound upregulation of the proapoptotic gene CHOP. Instead, Akt- and MAPK-dependent pathways were activated which may counteract proapoptotic signaling. Treatment with DMSO as a disaggregating agent or with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis reduced ER stress evoked by arginine deprivation. On the other hand, ER stress and apoptosis induction in arginine-starved cells could be critically augmented by the arginine analog of plant origin canavanine, but not by the classic ER stress inducer tunicamycin. Our data suggest that canavanine treatment applied under the lack of arginine may enhance the efficacy of arginine deprivation-based anticancer therapy.

Abstract: Currently, solar absorber plays a key role among all components of the concentrating solar power (CSP) system, which is considered as an important way for solar energy utilization. Due to the outstanding features of surface texture, nano-structured materials have been extensively utilized for solar energy harvesting and conversion, but most of them were synthesized by expensive or complicated techniques. Herein, for the first time, solar selective absorbers with uniquely foamed nanostructure, are grown in situ by facile hydrothermal method on stainless steel, without using any porogen or template. The selective absorber films, which comprised a large number of nanoparticle agglomerates and nanopores, have a vital role on the solar selective absorptance owing to the increased optical path as well as enhanced sunlight trapping via foamed nanostructure. They show an excellent solar thermal performance with the solar absorptance and the thermal emittance of 0.92 and 0.12, respectively. Besides, the solar absorber films also exhibit considerable solar thermal performance and benign thermal stability at high temperature. Due to the relieving internal stresses from foamed nanostructure, there is no obvious cracking within the entire structure even after heat treatment. Consequently, the hydrothermal method used in the present investigation happens to be a novel, pollution-free, low-cost, and suitable for simultaneous mass production for large-size absorber films. Moreover, the pre-treatment of substrate and post-treatment of films are also very convenient and environmental, without any complex procedure. Accordingly, the resultant films with foamed nanostructure will have a good prospect as a new-family of solar selective absorbers, which may have a tremendous potential for industrial production in the future.

Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic pathology caused by mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.
Objectives
As the intestine harbors the greatest number of CFTR transcripts after birth and since CFTR plays a role in glutathione transport, we hypothesized that CFTR deletion might produce oxidative stress (OxS) and inflammation in CF intestinal epithelial cell.
Methods
CFTR gene was abrogated in Caco-2/15 enterocytes through the zinc-finger nuclease system. Their oxidative and inflammatory characteristics were appreciated under basal conditions and after the treatment with the pro-oxidant iron-ascorbate (Fe/Asc) complex and pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
Results
Intestinal epithelial cells with CFTR knockout spontaneously exhibited an increased lipid peroxidation level, reflected by malondialdehyde overproduction and reduced antioxidant defense characterized by low enzymatic activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase. CFTR silencing also resulted in elevated protein expression of pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis Factor-α, interleukin-6, cyclooxygenase-2, and the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB. Moreover, exaggerated OxS and inflammation processes occurred in CFTR−/− cells in response to the addition of Fe/Asc and LPS, respectively.
Conclusions
Intestinal Caco-2/15 cells with CFTR deletion, display innate oxidative and inflammatory features while being more sensitive to pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory stimuli. These two pathophysiological processes could be implicated in CF-related intestinal disorders.

Abstract: Ultra-thin CdS layers non intentionally doped and doped with Cu were grown by chemical bath deposition and applied as buffer layers for chalcogenide CuIn1−xGaxSe2 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) based solar cells. We demonstrate that the use of Cu as dopant allows to reduce the CdS thickness below 30nm while keeping the same efficiency levels as those obtained with conventional 70nm in thickness undoped CdS. This is mainly explained by the improved VOC values when Cu-doped CdS is employed, obtaining voltages among the highest reported values, especially for CZTSe devices. We propose the formation of a metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) type device for explaining the observed experimental behavior based in indirect optoelectronic characterization of the layers and devices. This opens the possibility to use ultra-thin buffer layers for high efficiency chalcogenide based solar cells, reducing the environmental impact of the CdS buffer deposition, without detrimental impact on the optoelectronic properties of the devices.

Abstract: Angiotensin II (Ang II) works as a paracrine or autocrine cytokine agent to regulate renal functions and promotes podocytes dysfunction directly or indirectly, causing proteinuria. The glomerular slit diaphragm (SD) serves as a size-selective barrier and is linked to the actin-based cytoskeleton by adaptor proteins, including CD2-associated protein (CD2AP). Therefore, damages to CD2AP affect not only the function of the SD, but also directly disrupt the podocyte cytoskeleton, leading to proteinuria. In addition, CD2AP can facilitate the nephrin-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt signaling, which protects podocytes from apoptosis. Here we found that CD2AP staining was located diffusely but predominantly in the peripheral cytoplasm and CD2AP co-localized with nephrin in mouse podocytes; however, Ang II decreased CD2AP staining diffusely and induced a separation from concentrated nephrin. Ang II notably reduced CD2AP expression in time- and concentration-dependent manners, and this was significantly recovered by losartan. Ang II induced podocyte apoptosis in time- and concentration-dependent manners in TUNEL and FACS assays. LY294002, a PI3-K inhibitor, further reduced CD2AP expression and increased podocyte apoptosis, which was augmented by siRNA for CD2AP. Thus, Ang II induces the relocalization and reduction of CD2AP via AT1R, which would cause podocyte apoptosis by the suppression of CD2AP/PI3-K signaling.

Abstract: Lysosomal integral membrane protein-2 (LIMP-2) is an important protein in lysosomal biogenesis and function and also plays a role in the tissue inflammatory response. It is known that lysosomes play a central role in acute pancreatitis, with inflammatory cell infiltration triggering the disease early on. In this study we report increases in pancreatic LIMP-2 protein and mRNA levels as early events that occur during the development of cerulein (Cer)-induced acute pancreatitis (AP) in rats. GdCl3, a macrophage inhibitor, but not FK506, a T lymphocyte inhibitor, was able to reverse the increase in LIMP-2 expression after Cer treatment, although such reversion was abolished if the animals were depleted of neutrophils due to a vinblastine sulfate pre-treatment. Immunostaining revealed that the cellular source of LIMP-2 was mainly acinar cells. Additionally, pre-treatments with the MAPKs inhibitors SP600125 and PD98059, inhibitors of JNK and ERK½ activation, respectively, but not of rolipram, a type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor, suppressed the increase in the expression of LIMP-2 after Cer administration. Together, these results indicate that neutrophils are able to drive a macrophage activation that would regulate the increase in LIMP-2 expression during the early phase of Cer-induced AP, with the stress kinases JNK and ERK½ also playing a coordinated role in the increase of LIMP-2 expression due to Cer.

Abstract: A conjugated polymer poly (9,9-dioctyfluorene-co-benzothiazole) (F8BT) was used as the electron transporting layer (ETL) to modify the cathode interface of inverted planar perovskite solar cell. Incorporation of the thin F8BT layer delivered greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.9% compared to the PCE 7.9% of the device without F8BT, due to the improvements in various performance parameters like Voc, Jsc and FF. Moreover, great elimination of the hysteresis was demonstrated in F8BT based devices. These results suggest promising potential of polymeric materials in perovskite solar cells and possible approach to eliminate the hysteresis of perovskite solar cells with this class of interfacial materials.

Abstract: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of diabetes-associated cardiovascular disorders. The molecular mechanisms leading to ET-1 upregulation in diabetes are not entirely defined. c-Src tyrosine kinase regulates important pathophysiological aspects of vascular response to insults. In this study, we aimed to elucidate whether high glucose-activated c-Src signaling plays a role in the regulation of ET-1 expression. Human endothelial cells EAhy926 (ECs) were exposed to normal or high levels of glucose for 24h. Male C57BL/6J mice were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin and then treated with a specific c-Src inhibitor (Src I1) or c-Src siRNA. Real-time PCR, Western blot, and ELISA, were used to investigate ET-1 regulation. The c-Src activity and expression were selectively downregulated by pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated gene silencing, respectively. High glucose dose-dependently up-regulated c-Src phosphorylation and ET-1 gene and protein expression levels in human ECs. Chemical inhibition or silencing of c-Src significantly decreased the high-glucose augmented ET-1 expression in cultured ECs. In vivo studies showed significant elevations in the aortic ET-1 mRNA expression and plasma ET-1 concentration in diabetic mice compared to non-diabetic animals. Treatment with Src I1, as well as in vivo silencing of c-Src, significantly reduced the upregulated ET-1 expression in diabetic mice. These data provide new insights into the regulation of ET-1 expression in endothelial cells in diabetes. Pharmacological targeting of c-Src activity and/or expression may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce ET-1 level and to counteract diabetes-induced deleterious vascular effects.

Abstract: Low shear stress (LSS) contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis. Notch1 is a type I transmembrane receptor that critically determines the growth, differentiation, and survival of various cell types, but its role and mechanism in LSS-induced inflammatory response remains undetermined. Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE−/−) mice were fed with high fat diet and administered intraperitoneally with DAPT (a γ-secretase inhibitor). Perivascular shear stress modifiers were placed around the right carotid arteries to induce LSS. The left carotid arteries with undisturbed shear stress (USS) were used as the control. LSS increased Delta-like 1 (DLL-1) protein expression and the expression of Notch1 and NICD, while DAPT administration reduced NICD expression. Compared with the LSS group, DAPT reduced LSS-induced plaque formation and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposure to undisturbed shear stress (USS, 1Pa) or LSS (0.4Pa). Notch1 was inhibited by siRNA or DAPT. RT-PCR and western blotting analysis showed that LSS upregulated the expression of Notch1 in a time-dependent manner. Caveolin-1 (CAV1) inhibition by siRNA could reduce Notch1 and NICD expression. Compared with USS, LSS increased inflammatory response, including IL-1β and IL-6 secretion, ICAM-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and THP-1 cells adhesion. Notch1 inhibition by siRNA or DAPT could reduce these inflammatory responses by reduction of NF-κB phosphorylation, upregulation of IkBα expression, and inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-κB, while Notch1 activation by DLL-4 had an adverse effect. The Notch signaling system is therefore a potential target for modulating LSS-induced inflammation response during atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Four industrial-scale n-type Czochralski silicon crystals were grown with different impurity contents, i.e. metallics, phosphorus and oxygen. Horizontal slices were obtained from the top and middle of the crystals and were characterized in terms of lifetime and both defect and impurity distribution. The slabs characterization was performed both under as-grown conditions and after 2-step oxidation. Solar cells were fabricated from neighboring wafers with n-PASHA process and the overall efficiency determined. The crystal grown under low oxygen incorporation conditions has shown higher average as-grown lifetimes compared to the other crystals. The addition of lower phosphorus concentration to the melt resulted in an improvement of the lifetime of the crystal while the use of low grade feedstock has mainly affected the quality at the middle of the corresponding crystal. However, the major difference between top and middle heights was still the interstitial oxygen concentration for all crystals under investigation. The distribution of the interstitial oxygen concentration has not shown significant fluctuations through the samples radial direction. In addition, significant void fluctuations were found through the slabs radial direction, and demonstrate possible variations in the vacancy incorporation at the solidification interface during crystal growth. After heat treatment, large fluctuations of the lifetime were found through the samples radial direction, and are mainly associated to the local fluctuations of the oxygen precipitate density. However, these variations were suppressed in the crystal of lower oxygen incorporation. Solar cells performance degradation was mainly correlated with oxygen precipitation during their fabrication. It was also demonstrated that their efficiency is largely affected by the formation of detrimental striations of high periodicity. Their formation was thus associated to fluctuations of the vacancy concentration due to transient growth and their interaction with oxygen during crystal cooling. These oxygen nuclei may grow during solar cells processing and become even more detrimental to their performance.

Abstract: Two D2-A-D1-A-D2 type small molecules using Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as central building block, tetrazine (Tz) as an electron accepting moiety, bithiophene or terthiophene as end donor units were synthesized. The optical and electrochemical properties of synthesized molecules indicate that these molecules can absorb sunlight in a broad spectral range from 300 to 700nm and show suitable energy level for efficient exciton dissociation. The introduction of tetrazine unit in these molecules effectively reduces the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of these molecules, thus increases air stability of these molecules as well as the open circuit voltage (Voc) in photovoltaic devices. Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated by blending of these molecules with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) on indium tin oxide/glass substrates. This work afford promising power conversion efficiencies over 5.0%, with a large Voc of 0.98V, measured under air mass 1.5 global irradiation of 100mW/cm2.

Abstract: The structural, electrical, chemical, and optical properties of ternary Zn(O,S) thin films formed by atomic layer deposition (ALD) were investigated. It was revealed that the film׳s characteristics were highly influenced by the O/(O+S) ratio. The n-type Zn(O,S) layer was applied to both S-rich and Se-rich Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorbers as an alternative buffer layer to conventional CdS. The device performance relationship to the O/(O+S) ratio was examined. The highest power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.75% and 3.30% was achieved using an actual O/(O+S) ratio of ~0.67 in the buffer layer for S-rich and Se-rich CZTSSe solar cells, and these PCEs correspond to 77% and 67% of the standard CdS-based solar cells, respectively. Further improvement in Se-rich CZTSSe was demonstrated by using NH4OH solution instead of pure H2O as oxygen source during ALD process. The dependence of the solar cell performance on the O/(O+S) ratio was investigated using dark current density–voltage (J–V), external quantum efficiency (EQE), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).

Abstract: Arsenic trioxide is used to treat a variety of leukaemia types and causes tumour cell death. However, it is not well known whether arsenic trioxide is toxic to bone osteoblast cells, the precursor cells from which leukaemia cells originate. The aim of this study was to examine the response of osteosarcoma cell line MG63 and primary cultured osteoblasts to arsenic trioxide treatment. After 24h of treatment, arsenic trioxide was more effective at inhibiting cell growth and increasing oxidative stress and DNA damage in MG63 cells than in osteoblasts. In addition, arsenic trioxide arrested cell cycle progression in the G2/M phase, and induced apoptosis in MG63 cells, but not in primary cultured osteoblasts. The results further showed that the expression of transcription factor Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant effectors, including hemeoxygenase-1, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase, was increased in primary cultured osteoblasts. Additionally, expression of heat shock proteins was also increased. Experiments using inhibitors of antioxidant enzymes in the presence of arsenic trioxide-treated osteoblasts demonstrated that glutathione and superoxide dismutase were responsible for reducing oxidative stress, caspase-3 activity, and apoptosis and that heat shock proteins helped reduce caspase-3 activity. Unexpectedly, there was no apparent effect of the markedly increased hemeoxygenase-1, suggesting that other functions might exist for hemeoxygenase-1. These findings demonstrate that osteosarcoma cells are more sensitive to arsenic trioxide treatment than primary cultured osteoblasts and that primary cultured osteoblasts activate the Nrf2 signalling pathway in response to arsenic trioxide exposure to escape from oxidative damage and apoptosis.

Abstract: Redox regulation plays a key role in several physiopathological contexts and free radicals, from nitric oxide and superoxide anion up to other forms of reactive oxygen species (ROS), have been demonstrated to be involved in different biological and regulatory processes. The data reported in the current literature describe a link between ROS, inflammation and programmed cell death that is attracting interest as new pathways to be explored and targeted for therapeutic purposes. In this light, there is also growing attention to the involvement of this link in the activity of the TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL). TRAIL is a member of the TNF ligands super family able to mediate multiple intracellular signals, with the potential to lead to a range of biological effects in different cell types. In particular, the hallmark of TRAIL is the ability to induce selective apoptosis in transformed cells leaving normal cells almost unaffected and this feature has already opened the door to several clinical studies for cancer treatment. Moreover, TRAIL plays a role in several physiological and pathological processes of both innate and adaptive immune systems and of the cardiovascular context, with a strong clinical potential. Nonetheless, several issues still need to be clarified about the signaling mediated by TRAIL to gain deeper insight into its therapeutic potential. In this light, the aim of this review is to summarize the main preclinical evidences about the interplay between TRAIL and redox signaling, with particular emphasis to the implications in vascular physiopathology and cancer.

Abstract: Fibrillin-1 mutations promote Marfan syndrome (MFS) via complex yet unclear pathways. The roles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the major ER redox chaperone protein disulfide isomerase-A1 in the processing of normal and mutated fibrillin-1 and ensuing protein secretion and/or intracellular retention are unclear. Our results in mouse embryonic fibroblasts bearing the exon-skipping mgΔlox-P-neo (mgΔlpn) mutation, which associates in vivo with MFS and in vitro with disrupted microfibrils, indicate a preserved ER-dependent proteostasis or redox homeostasis. Rather, mutated fibrillin-1 is secreted normally through Golgi-dependent pathways and is not intracellularly retained. Similar results occurred for the C1039G point mutation. In parallel, we provide evidence that PDIA1 physically interacts with fibrillin-1 in the ER. Moreover, siRNA against PDIA1 augmented fibrillin-1 secretion rates in wild-type cells. However, fibrillin-1 with the mgΔlpn mutation bypassed PDI checkpoint delay, while the C1039G mutation did not. This heretofore undisclosed PDIA1-mediated mechanism may be important to control the extracellular availability of function-competent fibrillin-1, an important determinant of disease phenotype. Moreover, our results may reveal a novel, holdase-like, PDI function associated with ER protein quality control.

Abstract: Anomalous current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, as reported with increasing frequency, can significantly compromise the energy conversion efficiency of colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells. This paper applied a purely hopping transport model rather than the traditional Schottky-diode equation to interpret the anomalous I-V curves measured in CQD solar cells with a structure: ITO/ZnO/PbS-TBAI QD/PbS-EDT QD/Au. Anomalous I-V curves were found at temperatures below 300K. A double-diode-equivalent electric circuit was developed for the quantitative analysis of these anomalous I-V curves, yielding multiple hopping transport parameters, such as hopping diffusivity, diffusion length, mobility, and lifetime. Quantitative analysis revealed that the imbalanced charge carrier mobility in the carrier transport (PbS-TBAI) and extraction (PbS-EDT) layers, as well as the existence of a reverse Schottky diode at the PbS-EDT/Au interface, played key roles in the formation of the anomalous I-V curves. Furthermore, charge-transfer (CT) states, located at the ZnO/PbS-TBAI interface, were found to reduce the CQD solar cell open-circuit voltage through radiative and non-radiative recombination of excitons. A modified Einstein equation was also validated, further proving the presence of a Schottky barrier and pointing to a rate determining interface for the I-V behaviors of our solar cells.

Abstract: In the present work we report the synthesis of highly meso- and macro-porous thin TiO2 films as efficient scaffolds for improved performance of heterojunction solid state perovskite solar cells made in Fambient air. TiO2 films were prepared using sol–gel process and Pluronic P-123 block copolymer as organic template while they were formed on conductive glass substrates by spin-coating method. The films were employed to the construction of very efficient perovskite solar cells made at ambient conditions where CH3NH3PbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite was used as light harvester and P3HT polymer as hole conductor. The very rough and highly porous TiO2 films proved to be an excellent host material for perovskite growth. The structural properties of the TiO2 electron transport layer, thickness, particle size and porosity, strongly affected the overall conversion efficiency. The optimal structure and materials composition exhibited a notably high current density Jsc of 23.8mA/cm2, Voc of 0.995V and fill factor of 0.58. These solar cells prepared under ambient conditions yielded an average power conversion efficiency of 13.7% among the best ever recorded with P3HT polymer as hole conducting material.

Abstract: Available breast cancer therapeutic strategies largely target the primary tumor but are ineffective against tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. In our current study, we determined the effect of Cucurbitacin B (CuB), a plant triterpenoid, on the metastatic and angiogenic potential of breast cancer cells. CuB was found to inhibit cellular proliferation and induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Further, CuB-treatment significantly inhibited the migratory and invasive potential of highly metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells at sub-IC50 concentrations, where no significant apoptosis was observed. CuB was also found to inhibit migratory, invasive and tube-forming capacities of HUVECs in vitro. In addition, inhibition of pre-existing vasculature in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane ex vivo further supports the anti-angiogenic effect of CuB. CuB-mediated anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic effects were associated with the downregulation of VEGF/FAK/MMP-9 signaling, which has been validated by using FAK-inhibitor (FI-14). CuB-treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of VEGF-induced phosphorylation of FAK and MMP-9 expressions similar to the action of FI-14. CuB was also found to decrease the micro-vessel density as evidenced by the decreased expression of CD31, a marker for neovasculature. Further, CuB-treatment inhibited tumor growth, lung metastasis and angiogenesis in a highly metastatic 4T1-syngeneic mouse mammary cancer. Collectively, our findings suggest that CuB inhibited breast cancer metastasis and angiogenesis, at least in part, through the downregulation of VEGF/FAK/MMP-9 signaling.

Abstract: Fibrosis following injury is a common adaptive response in the liver, which can lead to irreparable and life-threatening cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma without effectual intervention. The molecular mechanisms underlying fibrogenic response in the liver remains poorly understood. Here we report that mice with deficiency in myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) showed resistance to thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis with significantly reduced expression of pro-fibrogenic genes when compared to wild type littermates. Over-expression of MRTF-A enhanced whereas depletion of MRTF-A alleviated pro-fibrogenic transcription induced by TGF-β, a major pro-fibrogenic factor in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Mechanistically, MRTF-A silencing in HSCs impacted the chromatin structure by reducing the deposition of methylated histone H3K4 on the promoters of pro-fibrogenic genes. Further analyses revealed that MRTF-A interacted with and recruited several key epigenetic factors involved in H3K4 methylation, including ASH2, WDR5, and SET1, to the promoters of pro-fibrogenic genes in response to TGF-β treatment. Over-expression of ASH2, WDR5, or SET1 enhanced the transactivation of pro-fibrogenic gene promoters by TGF-β in an MRTF-A-dependent manner. In conclusion, MRTF-A regulates liver fibrosis by epigenetically tuning the TGF-β signaling pathway in HSCs.

Abstract: Sodium acetate trihydrate is a promising phase change material for long term storage of solar thermal energy if supercooling is actively utilized. Well performing thermal energy storages need to be able to charge and discharge energy at a high rate. The relatively low thermal conductivity of the phase change material limits the heat exchange capacity rate to and from the storage. Another factor that limits the heat transfer is the contraction and expansion of the salt hydrate during the phase change. This density change causes formation of cavities inside the solid storage material. Investigations of the solidification behavior, the formation of cavities and thermal conductivity of composites based on sodium acetate trihydrate crystalizing with or without supercooling are presented in this paper. The thermal conductivity was measured with an ISOMET hot disc surface measurement probe. Samples that crystalized without supercooling tended to form solid crystals near the heat transfer surface and cavities away from the heat transfer surface. The measured thermal conductivity was up to 0.7W/mK in solid sodium acetate trihydrate. Samples that crystalized from supercooled state formed fewer large cavities but had a lower thermal conductivity. A composite with sodium acetate trihydrate, thickening agent and 5% graphite flakes had a thermal conductivity of up to 1.1W/mK.

Abstract: Feeding high-protein diets in animals can lead to a decrease of nitrogen utilization efficiency, and then promote the environmental pollution. Recently, more reports have demonstrated that lowering protein level in diets supplemented with specific amino acids can address these problems. However, the whole proteome alteration in the skeletal muscle of weaned piglets fed low-protein diets is poorly understood. Here, we applied the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification approach to investigate this alteration. We fed weaned piglets with normal protein diet (20% crude protein) and low-protein diet supplemented with lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan (17% crude protein) for 25days. Then proteomic profiling of skeletal muscles was performed. In total, 1354 proteins were quantified in the porcine skeletal muscle proteome. 132 proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins between the two groups. Differentially expressed proteins were significantly enriched in various nutrient metabolism including lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism. Interestingly, a total of 20 differentially expressed proteins, which are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, were all down-regulated by the low-protein diet feeding. Further immunoblotting confirmed the down-regulations of MT-ATP8, COX2, NDUFA6, and SDHB, four selected proteins among these 20 proteins. Meanwhile, the ATP level in the low-protein diet group was also reduced. These findings for the first time reveal that oxidative phosphorylation pathway is suppressed in longissimus dorsi muscle of weaned piglets fed low-protein diet supplemented with limiting amino acids, which may provide new insights into further formula design and the choice of limiting amino acids in diets.

Abstract: Research and development of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells has seen a marked increase since the recent expiry of core patents describing SHJ technology. SHJ solar cells are expected to offer various cost benefits compared to conventional crystalline silicon solar cells. This paper analyses the production costs associated with five different SHJ cell designs, including an interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) design. Using life-cycle costing, we analyzed the current cost breakdown of these SHJ designs, and compared them to conventional diffused junction monocrystalline silicon modules. Coupling the results for current designs with literature data on technological improvements, we also present a prospective analysis of production costs for the five SHJ cells and modules. For current designs, module costs were calculated to be 0.48–0.56 USD per Watt-peak (Wp) for SHJ modules, compared to 0.50USD/Wp for a conventional c-Si module. The efficiency bonus for SHJ modules compared to conventional c-Si modules is offset by a strong increase in metallization costs for SHJ designs, as comparatively large amounts of low-temperature silver-paste are required. For module materials, the requirement for conductive adhesives results in a small cost penalty for SHJ modules compared to c-Si modules, which is more than balanced by the effect of higher efficiency in SHJ modules. Our prospective study showed that improvements in cell processing and module design could result in a significant drop in production costs for all module types studied. The SHJ modules gain much advantage by reducing and replacing silver consumption, increased cell efficiency and thinner wafers and have prospective production costs of 0.29–0.35USD/Wp. Conventional c-Si module cost is less sensitive to silver paste consumption, limiting the potential for cost reduction, and has prospective production costs of 0.33USD/Wp. Replacement of indium-tin-oxide was not found to contribute substantially to a reduction in module costs.

Abstract: During bioethanol fermentation process, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell membrane is the first target to be attacked by the accumulated ethanol. In such a prominent position, S. cerevisiae cell membrane could reversely provide protection through changing fluidity or elasticity secondary to remodeled membrane components or structure during the fermentation process. However, there is yet to be a direct observation of the real effect of the membrane compositional change. In this study, atomic force microscope-based strategy was performed to determine Young's modulus of S. cerevisiae to directly clarify ethanol stress-associated changes and roles of S. cerevisiae cell membrane fluidity and elasticity. Cell survival rate decreased while the cell swelling rate and membrane permeability increased as ethanol concentration increased from 0% to 20% v/v. Young's modulus decreased continuously from 3.76MPa to 1.53MPa while ethanol stress increased from 0% to 20% v/v, indicating that ethanol stress induced the S. cerevisiae membrane fluidity and elasticity changes. Combined with the fact that membrane composition varies under ethanol stress, to some extent, this could be considered as a forced defensive act to the ethanol stress by S. cerevisiae cells. On the other hand, the ethanol stress induced loosening of cell membrane also caused S. cerevisiae cell to proactively remodel membrane to make cell membrane more agreeable to the increase of environmental threat. Increased ethanol stress made S. cerevisiae cell membrane more fluidized and elastic, and eventually further facilitated yeast cell’s survival.

Abstract: We demonstrate an effective light trapping back reflector (BR) for flexible thin-film solar cells (TFSCs) that is composed of self-ordered flexible nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (np-AAO) with hollow hexagonally-symmetric honeycomb textures (hollow-HSHT) under a cost-effective anodic oxidation approach. The dielectric nano-scatters are well compatible with nearly all types of TFSCs, including cells produced using high temperature processes. The performance of the hollow-HSHT nanostructure were investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The enhanced diffraction behavior, guided resonance and light absorption were identified through finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) simulation. A highly conductive AZO film was deposited on the hollow-HSHT as a back electric contact for making solar cells. As a result, the flexible and periodic hollow-HSHT based BR yielded an efficiency of 8.3% for thin-film a-Si:H solar cell, which is much higher than the efficiency of 6.7% for the reference cell on the flat AZO back contact. Furthermore, the hollow-HSHT based BR provides a means of enhancing absorption in whole wavelength range, thus opening an approach for creating high-efficiency, low cost flexible TFSCs.

Abstract: CZTSSe based thin film solar cells have received considerable interests due to low material cost, suitable band gaps and high absorption coefficient of CZTSSe materials. Achieving high efficiency CZTSSe based thin film solar cells often need a high temperature selenization process that always causes Sn loss in the form of gaseous SnSe2. Additional Sn complement may decrease the loss of Sn during selenization process and improve the performance of fabricated CZTSSe based thin film solar cells. Here, we investigate the effect of additional Sn complement on the performance of CZTSSe based thin film solar cells fabricated from pure element solution. XRD and Raman characterizations indicate that additional Sn complement could reduce the secondary phase that may cause the voltage loss and decrease of efficiency. The solar cell fabricated with 15% additional Sn complement shows the best conversion efficiency of 8.71% (VOC=0.42V, JSC=32.73mAcm−2, FF=63.19%). To the best of our knowledge, it is the highest efficiency of CZTSSe based thin film solar cells fabricated from pure element solution.

Abstract: Crosslinked high density polyethylene (XLPE) is kind of a solid–solid phase change material with high latent heat. In this study, melt flow indexer prove that such phase change material can be obtained through irradiating high density polyethylene by a 60Co source irradiation. DSC was used to distinguish the phase change temperature and latent heat of the prepared sample, and the specific heat was determined. Also, the structure of the crosslinked polyethylene and uncrosslinked one were analyzed using FTIR, XRD and SEM. Thermogravimetry analysis illustrated the samples׳ stability.

Abstract: Prolyl hydroxylase 2 is a key regulator of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha protein, and has previously been implicated as a tumor suppressor in various cancers. However, the function of prolyl hydroxylase 2 in liver cancer has yet to be elucidated. Characterization of prolyl hydroxylase 2 function and related mechanisms in liver cancer may enable the development of targeted therapy. Here we found that prolyl hydroxylase 2 overexpression in human hepatocellular carcinoma cancer cell lines inhibited cell proliferation, while prolyl hydroxylase 2 knockdown enhanced cell proliferation. Further analyses revealed that the prolyl hydroxylase 2-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation was due to a cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition. Moreover, the block in cell cycle was facilitated by negative regulation of cyclin D1, a process dependent on the hydroxylase activity of prolyl hydroxylase 2. Using an in vivo xenograft mouse model, we found that the overexpression of prolyl hydroxylase 2 led to a reduction in tumor size. Evaluation of paired human liver cancer patient samples revealed that prolyl hydroxylase 2 protein levels were significantly reduced in 6 of the 10 cancer tissues as compared to their respective normal tissue controls. Furthermore, elevated expression of prolyl hydroxylase 2 was associated with significantly prolonged survival in patients with liver cancer. These results suggest that prolyl hydroxylase 2 plays an important tumor suppressive role in liver cancer and may prove to be of prognostic and therapeutic value.

Abstract: The physical and photoelectrochemical characterizations of a new inorganic-organic hybrid single crystal material, synthesized by hydrothermal route, based on α-Keggin-type polyoxotungstate and Cu(I)-(trz) coordination complex, namely [Cu6(trz)6][α-PW12O40]2·H2O, [trz=1H-1,2,4-triazole] are investigated for the first time. The crystal structure, determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, reveals a 3-D supramolecular host-guest structure with Keggin anion as template. The diffuse reflectance indicates an optical transition at 2.91eV, directly allowed, attributed to the Keggin polyoxoanions. The physical characterization shows a semiconductor behavior and the conductivity follows an exponential type law associated to a small polaron hopping between neighboring ions. The thermo-power measurement indicates n-type conduction with an electron mobility (0.54×10−6cm2V−1s−1), thermally activated. The photoelectrochemical study, performed in Na2SO4 medium, confirms n-type conduction with a flat band potential of −0.65 VSCE and electrons density of 6.59×1018cm−3. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals the predominance of the bulk contribution with a constant phase element and Warburg diffusion. As application, the photo-degradation of Rhodamine B upon sunlight and UV irradiation is achieved by the radicals O2•- and OH•. The improved activity is attributed to the wide depletion width (460nm) and the potentials of the valence and conduction bands close to the radicals levels.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology has the potential to provide cheap solar electricity, given advances in low-cost production and module efficiency and lifetime. However, several uncertainties remain in terms of the future costs of OPV modules, which depend on future material and manufacturing costs, as well as key performance characteristics. This assessment takes an engineering-based approach to assessing the potential future cost of each component of OPV modules, as well as the future scale of OPV production plants and associated scale economies, using stochastic analysis to account for uncertainty. The analysis suggests that OPV module costs could fall within a (interquartile) range of US$0.23–0.34/Wp, with a median cost estimate of US$0.28/Wp in the near-term, with future costs most sensitive to manufacturing scale, cell efficiency and module fill factor. This compares to a projected range of module costs for more established PV technologies (crystalline silicon, cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenide) of US$0.35–0.6/Wp by 2020. In levelised cost of electricity terms, OPV could compete with the established technologies in both roof- and ground-mounted systems if it can achieve a 10-year lifetime.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) device is fabricated with Zn1−xSnxO (ZTO) buffer layer deposited by atomic layer deposited (ALD). The ALD process results in a precise control of thickness and Sn/(Sn+Zn) ratio of the buffer layer. The performance of the CZTSSe device with ZTO buffer layer has been enhanced by adjusting proper Zn and Sn ratio during the ALD process. The optimized Sn/(Sn+Zn) pulse ratio is found to be around 0.167, with a thickness of around 50nm. The champion device with a ZTO buffer layer has an efficiency of 8.60% (active area efficiency 9.20%) compared with 8.14% (active area efficiency 8.70%) of the reference solar cell with chemical bath deposited CdS buffer layer. The optimum device performance is a result of optimized band alignment between CZTSSe absorber and the ALD ZTO buffer as shown by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).

Abstract: A wide consensus based on robust experimental evidence indicates pyroglutamylated amyloid-β isoform (AβpE3-42) as one of the most neurotoxic peptides involved in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, AβpE3-42 co-oligomerized with excess of Aβ1-42, produces oligomers and aggregates that are structurally distinct and far more cytotoxic than those made from Aβ1-42 alone. Here, we investigate quantitatively the influence of AβpE3-42 on biophysical properties and biological activity of Aβ1-42. We tested different ratios of AβpE3-42/Aβ1-42 mixtures finding a correlation between the biological activity and the structural conformation and morphology of the analyzed mixtures. We find that a mixture containing 5% AβpE3-42, induces the highest disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis and the highest neuronal toxicity. These data correlate to an high content of relaxed antiparallel β-sheet structure and the coexistence of a population of big spheroidal aggregates together with short fibrils. Our experiments provide also evidence that AβpE3-42 causes template-induced misfolding of Aβ1-42 at ratios below 33%. This means that there exists a critical concentration required to have seeding on Aβ1-42 aggregation, above this threshold, the seed effect is not possible anymore and AβpE3-42 controls the total aggregation kinetics.

Abstract: A promising new generation of solar thermal collector able to enhance the thermal efficiency is the DASC (Direct Absorber Solar Collector). In this paper we report optical absorption measurements performed on several water-based nanofluids (Al2O3, CuO, TiO2, ZnO, CeO2, and Fe2O3) as a function of nanoparticles concentration. These measurements are of fundamental importance to assess the possibility to use the above mentioned metal-oxide nanoparticles in liquid-based nanofluids for direct absorption low temperature flat panel solar collector. The obtained results show different optical behaviors of the nanofluids depending on nanoparticles material and concentration. In all measurements the transmittance rises passing from visible to infrared region and in some cases, when the nanoparticles concentration is too low, the extinction distance grows up to values larger than the typical diameter of a solar receiver.

Abstract: Complex interplay of intracellular signaling networks, spanning from the extracellular environment to the nucleus, orchestrate normal cell growth and survival. Dysregulation of such signals contributes to malignant transformation, thereby giving the cancer cells a survival advantage, but also could be exploited for new anticancer interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pan class-I PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120 on two distinct acute leukemia cell lines, NB4 (with mutant p53) and Nalm-6 (with wild-type p53). Our data highlighted the efficacy of the inhibitor against APL and pre B ALL cell lines; however, we failed to find an obvious correlation between p53 status and the sensitivity of leukemic cells to NVP-BKM120. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of p53 target genes in Nalm-6 cells, indicating a p53-dependent mechanism involved in NVP-BKM120 cytotoxicity. On the other hand, cytotoxic effects in mutant p53-expressing NB4 cells seem to be mediated mostly by the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB axis. In conclusion, we suggest NVP-BKM120 induces apoptosis through p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms, indicating the potential application of the inhibitor in both wild-type and deficient p53-expressing leukemic cells.

Abstract: Photovoltaic materials are spectrally selected and their electrical output is affected by the spectral distribution of the incident irradiance. The performance of high concentrator photovoltaic (HCPV) systems is more influenced by the spectral changes than conventional single-junction photovoltaic (PV) systems due to the use of multi-junction (MJ) solar cells and optical devices. Despite this, the detailed comparison of the spectral impact on the electrical output of HCPV and PV technology under the same atmospheric conditions has not been addressed yet. Because of this, this paper aims to compare the spectral impact on the energy yield of both type of devices at a monthly and annual time scale at several locations with disparate climate conditions. The spectral dependence of both technologies is quantified by using the spectral factor (SF) index in conjunction with the Simple Model of Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine (SMARTS) at five locations of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) database. The present paper shows that the current HCPV systems present annual spectral losses of around 5% with respect to PV systems at representative locations.

Abstract: Aquaporin (AQP) and chloride channels are ubiquitous in virtually all living cells, playing pivotal roles in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. We previously reported that AQP-3 aquaglyceroporin and ClC-3 chloride channels could form complexes to regulate cell volume in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. In this study, the roles of AQP-3 in their hetero-complexes were further investigated. Glycerol entered the cells via AQP-3 and induced two different Cl− currents through cell swelling-dependent or -independent pathways. The swelling-dependent Cl− current was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with CuCl2 and AQP-3-siRNA. After siRNA-induced AQP-3 knock-down, the 140mM glycerol isoosmotic solution swelled cells by 22% (45% in AQP-3-intact cells) and induced a smaller Cl− current; this current was smaller than that activated by 8% cell volume swelling, which induced by the 140mM glycerol hyperosmotic solution in AQP-3-intact cells. This suggests that the interaction between AQP-3 and ClC-3 plays an important role in cell volume regulation and that AQP-3 may be a modulator that opens volume-regulated chloride channels. The swelling-independent Cl− current, which was activated by extracellular glycerol, was reduced by CuCl2 and AQP-3-siRNA pretreatment. Dialyzing glycerol into cells via the pipette directly induced the swelling-independent Cl− current; however this current was blocked by AQP-3 down-regulation, suggesting AQP-3 is essential for the opening of chloride channels. In conclusion, AQP-3 is the pathway for water, glycerol and other small solutes to enter cells, and it may be an essential modulator for the gating of chloride channels.

Abstract: In this article, carbon- (PCPDTTBT) and silicon-bridged (PSiPDTTBT) cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT)-based polymers have been synthesized. We have systematically studied the effect of replacing a carbon atom with a silicon atom on the main chain of the conjugated polymer and the optoelectronic properties. With the simple substitution, the results indicate that the PSiPDTTBT reveals a higher crystallinity, improved thermal stability, charge transport properties, and lower resistance at the polymer-electrolyte interface. As a result, the PSiPDTTBT exhibits better electrochromic properties including higher contrast and coloration efficiency (CE) with respect to its carbon analogs. We attribute this better electrochromic performance to the presence of strong π–π stacking in the silicon-bridged CPDT-based polymer. The PSiPDTTBT shows a transmittance window of 55.5% at 560nm and CE of 434mC/cm2.

Abstract: Highly-transparent and flexible random mesh-like Ag networks formed by self-assembled Ag nanoparticles for use in transparent and flexible electrodes for ITO-free flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) was demonstrated. By transferring a self-assembled Ag nanoparticle network onto a PET substrate, embossed and intaglio-type mesh-like Ag network electrodes were fabricated. Electrical, optical, morphological, and mechanical properties of the embossed and intaglio-type mesh-like Ag network electrodes were compared in detail. Although both mesh-like Ag networks exhibited similar sheet resistance, optical transmittance, and flexibility, the intaglio-type Ag networks were advantageous to use as transparent electrodes for FOSCs due to the high aspect ratio of emboss-type Ag networks. Regardless of organic active materials, FOSCs with intaglio-type Ag networks exhibited better performance than FOSCs with emboss-type Ag networks due to ease in forming uniform organic layer coatings on the intaglio-type Ag networks embedded in the substrate. This indicated that intaglio-type mesh-like Ag network electrodes are a promising flexible and transparent anode for printable ITO-free FOSCs.

Abstract: A series of semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (IPN) of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly(HEMA)) and crosslinked polyethylene glycol (PEG) were prepared by simultaneous IPN polymerisation technique. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was used for crosslinking. The prepared semi-IPNs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), swelling studies and contact angle measurements. The river like pattern of fractured cross section of the SEM micrograph of IPNs indicated no phase separation and also siloxane moiety placement on matrix-air interface. The semi-IPN samples are found to possess crystalline spherulites and the crystallinity reduces as the percentage of poly(HEMA) increases as demonstrated by XRD and POM. Maximum melting enthalpy obtained from DSC thermogram was around 145J/g. The contact angle studies show that the relative hydrophobicity of the semi-IPNs increases with increase in content of HEMA in the semi-IPNs. These materials show satisfactory latent heat storage capacity and good thermal reliability for application as phase change material (PCM).

Dynamic epigenetic mechanisms regulate age-dependent SOX9 expression in mouse articular cartilage,

Abstract: While the developmental role of the SOX9 transcription factor in chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation is well documented, age-dependent SOX9 expression in articular chondrocytes (ACs) and its regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to explore epigenetic regulatory mechanisms for age-related changes in SOX9 expression in ACs of mice, spanning from the developmental stage to 18 months of age. Sox9 mRNA and protein were highly expressed in ACs during joint development but significantly decreased after 2 months of age. Histopathological features of osteoarthritis were not observed in examined hip and shoulder joints by 18 months of age. Epigenetic studies revealed that DNA methylation levels were increased at specific CpG islands of the Sox9 gene at 6 and 12 months; treatment of cultured ACs from 6-month-old mice with 5-azacytidine (an inhibitor of DNA methylation) elevated the level of Sox9 expression in ACs by lowering DNA methylation levels in the Sox9 promoter region. Histone 3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2, a histone modification for transcriptional activation) in the Sox9 promoter region was decreased with age, which was associated with the age-dependent decrease in SOX9 expression in ACs. Knockdown of lysine-specific demethylase-1 up-regulated SOX9 expression in ACs of adult mice through increased recruitment of H3K4me2 in the Sox9 promoter region. Our results suggest that SOX9 expression in mouse ACs is significantly decreased after the completion of joint development. These age-dependent changes in SOX9 expression are dynamically regulated by DNA methylation and histone methylation.

Abstract: Programmed assembly of colloidal inorganic nanocrystal superstructures is crucial for the realization of future artificial solids as well as present optoelectronic applications. Here, we present a new way to assemble quantum dots reversibly using binary solvents. By tuning the temperature and composition of the binary solvent mixture, we achieve reversible aggregation of nanocrystals in solution induced by critical Casimir forces. We study the temperature-sensitive quantum-dot assembly with dynamic light scattering. We show that careful screening of the electrostatic repulsion by adding salt provides a further parameter to tune the reversible assembly.

Abstract: Front and rear contacted wafer-based c-Si solar cells characterized by P-diffused emitter and Al-based back surface field currently constitute the dominant solar cell architecture in the photovoltaic market. The key success of this technology is based on the simple and cost effective fabrication process. However, its conversion efficiency is limited. High-efficiency c-Si solar cells architectures have been demonstrated at laboratory and industrial scale with the aim of decreasing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by increasing efficiency. For this reason, high-efficiency solar cells are expected to increase their market share in next decade. In particular, interdigitated back contacted (IBC) c-Si solar cell architecture, which the current world record efficiency is based on, is expected to gain shortly relevance at industrial level. In this work, activities at TUDelft on the fabrication of IBC c-Si solar cells are reported. In particular, a novel method for realizing high-efficiency IBC c-Si solar cells based on single-side and (relatively) low-temperature doping techniques is demonstrated. In particular, epitaxial growth of B-doped Si is used to form the emitter, while P-ion implantation is deployed to form both front and back surface fields. To pattern the rear junction, a self-aligned process based on one lithographic step has been developed. In addition, metal lift-off is used to define the metal contacts of both polarities. By using this process, efficiency higher than 20% has been demonstrated.

Abstract: A significant fraction of Czochralski (Cz) Silicon (Si) wafers suffer from oxygen-related bulk quality issues. The detection of such wafers in the as-cut state during incoming inspection has become a topic of attention as higher efficiency solar cell structures are developing. However such detection - for instance using photoluminescence images – has not yet proven successful due to a high risk of detection errors Shih et al. (2015) [1]. In this work, we tentatively introduce a material quality indicator referred to as “Thermal History Index” (THI) and investigate its ability, in conjunction with the interstitial oxygen concentration ([Oi]), to allow a better identification of low bulk quality wafers.

Abstract: Hypoxia is a salient feature of most solid tumors and plays a central role in tumor progression owing to its multiple contributions to therapeutic resistance, metastasis, angiogenesis and stemness properties. Reports exist in literature about hypoxia increasing stemness characteristics and invasiveness potential of malignant cells. In order to delineate molecular crosstalk among factors driving glioma progression, we used knockdown and overexpression strategies. We have demonstrated that U87MG and A172 glioma cells inherently have a subset of cells with high migratory potential due to migration-inducing Mena transcripts. These cells also have elevated stemness markers (Sox-2 and Oct-4). There was a significant increase of number in this subset of migratory cells on exposure to hypoxia with corresponding elevation (over 1000 fold) in migration-inducing Mena transcripts. We were able to demonstrate that a HIF-2α-Sox-2/Oct-4-Mena (INV) axis that is strongly activated in hypoxia and markedly increases the migratory potential of the cells. Such cells also formed tumor spheres with greater efficiency. We have correlated our in-vitro results with human glioblastoma samples and found that hypoxia, invasiveness and stemness markers correlated well in native tumor samples. This study identifies a novel signaling mechanism mediated by HIF-2α in regulating invasiveness and stemness characteristics, suggesting that under hypoxic conditions, some tumor cells acquire more migratory potential by increased Pan Mena and Mena INV expression as a consequence of this HIF-2α mediated increase in Oct-4 and Sox-2. These properties would help the cells to form a new nidus after local invasion or metastasis.

Abstract: CD44 is a cell adhesion molecule that plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis. The role of CD44 in tumorigenesis is due to its binding to extracellular matrix components, including hyaluronan (HA) and osteopontin (OPN), and to messenger molecules, such as growth factors present in the tumor microenvironment. HA and OPN are highly abundant in the leukemic stem cell niche and in solid tumors of various cancer types, where they contribute to the maintenance of the stemness of malignant cells. CD44 has consequently been recognized as a cancer stem cell marker in several types of cancers, which has been a topic of much recent research. In this review we have addressed the question of how CD44 might promote cancer cell stemness by interacting with extracellular matrix components, growth factors and cytokines.

Abstract: In this paper, first of all, the configuration, optical and thermal properties of WO3-based gasochromic (GC) smart window are briefly reviewed. Subsequently, using the eQUEST building simulation program, the effect of GC smart window on the energy consumption for a commercial office building has been calculated and compared with various glazing systems currently available on the market, including SAGE@ electrochromic (EC) smart window. Simulation results indicate that the hot summer and cold winter regions are the most suitable testing grounds employing smart windows, and the decrease of HVAC loads in shanghai is 28.4% and 11.5% when using GC smart window to replace the single clear float glass and the colored absorbing double glass unit, respectively. Despite the limitation of coloration depth, GC smart window consumes less energy in Harbin than EC does. Also, according to the simulation data, there is no need to change the window’s state hourly unless the occurrence of extreme weather condition.

Abstract: The effects of quantum dot (QD) size on the optical and electrical properties of InAs/GaAs QD solar cells (QDSCs) were investigated. QDSCs with varying InAs QD size were fabricated by controlling the total InAs deposition thickness (θ) from 0 to 3.0 mono-layers (ML). The optical and electrical properties of the QDSCs were investigated using photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved PL (TRPL), photoreflectance (PR) spectroscopy, capacitance-voltage (C-V), and current-voltage (J-V) measurements. The QD size effects on the p-n junction electric fields (Fpn) and the efficiencies (η) of the QDSCs were revealed. The QDSCs had a maximum η of 21.17% for θ=2.0ML (the efficiency is enhanced by 17.4% over the reference GaAs-SC) and minimized Fpn (113kV/cm) by an enhanced photovoltaic effect caused by improved carrier generation. We find that these optimal properties result from a balance between carrier generation and exhaustion processes through trapping and re-capturing by defects and relatively large QDs.

Abstract: Local series resistance measurements are an essential tool for optimization of silicon solar cells and cell concepts. This holds especially for nearly all advanced cell concepts where the minority carrier properties are improved at the expense of the majority ones (e.g., by a lower-doped emitter or point contacts at the back side). For such solar cells, frequency-dependent CELLO measurements allow an efficient series resistance characterization since they can e.g. distinguish ohmic losses originating in the volume of a solar cell from the total ohmic losses, thereby making it possible to identify wafer thickness variations. The thickness information allows to improve the reliability of fitting parameter results obtained from a CELLO impedance analysis and to identify other thickness-variation-related problems that may occur in the fabrication process.

Abstract: The impact of buildings on the environment, energy consumption and climate change is significant, as they use a large amount of resources across their life-cycle. Since windows play an important role in the overall energy and environmental performance of buildings, emerging technologies are focused on the optimization of these building components. Among window design technologies, electrochromic (EC) devices have received growing interest for their ability to dynamically manage the daylight and solar energy entering buildings. Near-infrared switching electrochromic (NEC) glazed windows use a novel EC window technology that is able to continuously provide high transparency while modulating solar heat gains. This study evaluated the manufacturing phase of NEC windows to understand if their use phase performance comes at acceptable manufacturing burdens. This study also identified which constraints are connected to the market shift to the novel technology, which can provide the research community with useful information to better design the technology as it develops. A comparative “cradle-to-gate” energy and emissions analysis was carried out between NEC and conventional EC windows. The obtained results for the Global Warming Potential of the conventional EC device was 85kg CO2-eq/m2 and the Cumulative Energy Demand was 1680MJ-eq/m2. Results for the NEC device were found to be 50kg CO2-eq/m2 and 1050MJ-eq/m2, with the reduction primarily due to replacing the energy intensive thin film deposition used in conventional EC with a solution-based coating process. Finally, when an entire window is modeled (EC device, frame, glazing and sealing), the difference over conventional EC, in terms of primary energy consumption, ranged for the whole window manufacturing from 15% to 21%, depending on the material of the frame.

Abstract: Molten nitrate salts (KNO3–NaNO3) are used extensively as heat transfer fluids in concentrated solar power (CSP) applications. The oxidative character of nitrate salts at high temperature conditions leads to challenges in the corrosion protection of CSP installations in contact with molten salts. This work reports efforts to protect low-cost ferritic–martensitic P91 (Cr9–Mo1) and austenitic stainless steel 304SS materials against molten salt corrosion using slurry aluminizing. The gravimetric results show a significant improvement for aluminized alloys up to 1700h immersion in molten nitrate salt at 600°C. The extent of protection in P91 becomes comparable with the most competitive resistant materials e.g. Inconel 625. Metallographic investigations and scanning electron micrographs reveal no sign of corrosion in the substrates beneath the aluminide coatings during the immersion test. Electron probe microanalysis results reveal Na(Fe,Al)O2 as the protective corrosion product forming on the surface of both aluminized steels.

Abstract: Despite the significant efforts and discoveries during the last few years in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expression and crystallization, the receptors with known structures to date are limited only to a small fraction of human GPCRs. The lack of experimental three-dimensional structures of the receptors represents a strong limitation that hampers a deep understanding of their function. Computational techniques are thus a valid alternative strategy to model three-dimensional structures. Indeed, recent advances in the field, together with extraordinary developments in crystallography, in particular due to its ability to capture GPCRs in different activation states, have led to encouraging results in the generation of accurate models. This, prompted the community of modelers to render their methods publicly available through dedicated databases and web-servers. Here, we present an extensive overview on these services, focusing on their advantages, drawbacks and their role in successful applications. Future challenges in the field of GPCR modeling, such as the predictions of long loop regions and the modeling of receptor activation states are presented as well.

Abstract: There are different ways to determine the bandgap of a semiconductor. In the case of strong tailing they lead to different results. Various versions of Tauc’s plot give the gap of extended states, whereas the photoluminescence and the quantum efficiency extend into the tail states. The absorption edge in kesterite is determined by tail states therefore different methods to determine the band gap lead to different results. To decide whether the main recombination path is in the bulk or at the interface, the activation energy of the recombination rate should be compared to the energy of the radiative recombination in the bulk. This is the energy of the photoluminescence maximum and can be approximated by the linear extrapolation of the low energy edge of the quantum efficiency spectrum.

Abstract: In this work, the eutectic Na2CO3–NaCl molten salt was investigated as a new high temperature phase change material for solar thermal energy storage. The composition of the eutectic binary salt was determined with the aid of FactSage software and its thermophysical properties were investigated using a Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer (STA) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Inductively coupled plasma analysis has shown that the composition of the as-prepared sample is consistent with the nominal one. The STA results exhibit that the melting point of the eutectic salt is 637.0°C and its heat of fusion is 283.3J/g whereas its specific heat is a function of temperature, which all are in agreement with the theoretical values determined by the FactSage software. The thermal stability analysis indicates that the eutectic molten salt has good thermal stability without weight loss in a CO2 environment at temperatures below 700°C, compared with 0.51% weight loss in a N2 atmosphere. The weight loss observed in the latter, is most likely to be due to the salt׳s decomposition at high temperature. The thermophysical properties of the salt such as melting temperature, latent heat of fusion and solidification, varied marginally after 50 and 100 thermal cycle tests. This demonstrates that the eutectic Na2CO3–NaCl salt is a promising high temperature phase change material when used in a CO2 environment or encapsulation.

Abstract: Superstrate Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells are prepared in the structure SLG/TCO/buffer/CIGS/Au with CIGS deposited onto the buffer layer by a single stage co-evaporation process. Three buffer materials – CdS deposited by chemical surface deposition, ZnSe and ZnO by RF magnetron sputtering – are tested in the superstrate structure. The best cell achieves 8.6% efficiency with the ZnO buffer after light soaking and forward bias treatments. The efficiency of devices with CdS or ZnSe buffers are less than 4%. The junction formation between the absorber and buffer layers are investigated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. For CdS/CIGS and ZnSe/CIGS superstrate devices extensive inter-diffusion between the absorber and buffer layer under CIGS growth condition is the critical problem. For ZnO/CIGS superstrate cells GaxOy formation at the junction interface and unfavorable conduction band alignment are the main factors that limit the device performance.

Abstract: Crystalline Si solar cells as mounted in photovoltaic modules are historically encapsulated using ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) to provide mechanical support, protection against environmental exposure and electrical isolation. Nevertheless, new requirements in the final photovoltaic grid connection cannot successfully be reach by using this polymer current chemical composition. This phenomenon is known as the potential induced degradation (PID). Photovoltaic encapsulant industry has developed innovative materials to overcome this potential aging. One of these new materials is a thermoplastic commonly named as polyolefin. Photovoltaic modules using this encapsulation material have been fabricated in an industrial line and they have been subjected to PID tests. Our results demonstrate that polyolefin can successfully overcome PID test. Therefore it can be considered as a suitable EVA substitutive.

Abstract: The potential for using Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) generators as an alternative for recovering energy losses in steel production industry is assessed. A mathematical model for the assessment of the performance of TPV application in the iron and steel industry has been developed. In order to support the mathematical model, a sample TPV apparatus in laboratory scale based on an IR emitter has been designed and assembled. The key modeling parameters of TPV generator include: the open circuit voltage, the short circuit current density and fill factor of the TPV cell. These parameters have been considered in the model as functions of several variables such as: the emitter (hot steel slab) temperature, the cell temperature, the distance between the cells and emitter, the spectral response and the cell energy gap. The External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) as an important indicator of the cell׳s spectral response is included in the model. Moreover, the variation of the emitter temperature has been considered. Several tests have been carried out for different values of the cell-emitter gap. It has been found that when the GaSb cells are used for energy recovery, a minimum temperature of 873°C is required. The upper limit of the emitter temperature is usually determined in steel production process associated with hot rolling process which has a temperature around 1250°C. Finally, the total efficiency of the system was obtained to 4.12%, when GaSb cell with temperature of 27°C and slab emitters with temperature of 1257°C are used. The results of the simulation of the model in a casting process at the Mobarakeh Steel Complex have shown a potential of energy recovery of 26.987MJ per year.

Abstract: Shape stability and thermal performance of composite shape-stabilized phase change materials (SSPCMs) composed of poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride)-g-octadecanol (SMAC18) comb-like polymer and graphene oxide (GO) nanoplatelets are studied under various GO contents. Thanks to the adsorption and protection of GO layered structure, SMAC18/GO SSPCMs exhibit a good phase change characteristics and shape-stabilized performance. At a higher temperature, 160°C, which is far above the melting temperature of SMAC18, a stable appearance is revealed, and the thermal stability of SMAC18/GO shows a linear enhancement with GO contents, demonstrating the good thermal barrier effect from GO nanofillers. Thermal energy storage efficiency and thermal reliability after 500 thermal cycles are well proved, and the thermal buffer time is similar to that of SMAC18, indicating that GO nanoplatelets have a slightly effect on the heat-storage and release behavior during the phase change process. The combined physical adsorption and hydrogen bonding between GO and SMA matrix contributes the enhanced shape-stability and thermal performance of SMAC18/GO SSPCMs, offering a future perspective for energy storage applications.

Abstract: Low open circuit voltage (VOC) has been recognized as one of the principle limitations in the current generation of kesterite based solar cells. In order to investigate the origin and possible solution for this problem, the influence of point defects and secondary phases on the performance of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) devices is explored. Compositionally graded CZTSe films have been prepared with nearly 200 solar cells, each with minute changes in cation composition. Systematic structural characterization of these absorbers with Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction is used to detect secondary phases and defect clusters, and their relative concentration is correlated to device properties. The presented results show the experimental evidence of the effect of the Cu-substitutional defects, in particular [VCu+ZnCu], on the optoelectronic properties, especially VOC. It is shown that VOC can be tuned by adjusting composition, and consequently the amount of the [VCu+ZnCu] defect clusters. Furthermore, it is proven that this is intrinsic property of the CZTSe material, independent of the synthesis and post-deposition processes used for the preparation of samples. Secondary phases are also found to influence device properties, and their effects are dependent on whether they are present in the bulk or surface of the absorber.

Abstract: In the context of reducing CO2 emissions and balancing energy supply and demand across the electricity grid, energy storage has become an important topic. Therefore, new energy policies are looking for more efficient and environmental friendly technologies. The aim of this research is to assist in the implementation of the renewable energies technologies and to improve the energy efficiency in well-known and established processes by recovering and storing heat. Moreover, the use of a recycled material as a storage media for thermal energy storage applications shows a more sustainable use of resources reducing at the same time the overall cost. In this research a novel composite, a recycled high density polyethylene (HDPE)/graphite(Cg) mixture, for medium temperature thermal energy storage application has been formulated and characterized. One common characteristic of polymers is their low thermal conductivities. This causes a slow thermal response when the PCM is used in high power applications. In this study the thermal conductivity properties of the HDPE/Cg were enhanced by the optimization of its manufacturing process and composition. Graphite content was added in different mass fractions into the PCM, and thermal properties were measured by means of Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Laser Flash Analysis (LFA). The experimental results showed that the thermal conductivities are improved by the higher mass fraction of graphite. When the graphite content was in the ratio of 20wt%, the thermal conductivity of the PCM increased from 0.51Wm−1K−1 up to 1.31Wm−1K−1. The secondary electron microscopy confirms a good homogeneity of the manufacturing process. Further chemical stability analysis was performed by means of charging and discharging processes. The cycled samples present good thermal property reliability at temperatures up to 250°C.
