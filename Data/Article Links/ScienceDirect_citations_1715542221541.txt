Abstract: Phase change materials (PCM) used in thermal energy storage systems present high storage capacity and require low temperature variation to allow effective heat charge or discharge density. However, these materials involve too low thermal conductivities (<1Wm−1K−1) which can limit the heat transfer power between the heat transfer fluid and the phase change zone. In the first part of this study, high power level composites made of PCM (organic and also inorganic) and graphite have been elaborated in the thermal range from 50 to 350°C in order to increase the effective thermal conductivity. In a second part, the assessment of their use as solar absorbers has been realized. Results show that these composites present high absorptance with respect to the whole solar radiation spectra. This allows new potentiality of integration of such materials in solar thermal processes offering a direct management of heat variation at the very first step of the process.

Abstract: Organic inorganic lead halide Perovskite photovoltaic devices are promising candidates for commercial application because of their high efficiency and low production cost. One integral part of these high efficiency solar cells is electron transport layer that provides the electron contact selectivity and mitigates recombination phenomena for enhanced device performance. However, high temperature sintering process of most widely used Titanium oxide electron transport layer or the sophisticated, time consuming processing with nanostructured electron extraction material is a fundamental barrier to mass production of Perovskite solar cell with roll-to-roll process. In this work, we have reported the application of simple, low temperature processed (<150 °C) sol-gel ZnO thin film as electron transport layer with efficient (PCE: 8.77%), highly reproducible Perovskite solar cell. Consecutive spin coating process has been implemented to find a multi-layer ZnO film that ensures high optical absorption in photoactive Perovskite layer by acting as a highly transmitting, less reflective, transparent layer. The optimized ZnO film also provides coherent surface morphology for the proper crystalline growth of overlying Perovskite layer and suppresses the deep trap states existing at the ZnO/perovskite interface. A systematic impedance spectroscopy study has been presented in this work to comprehend the improved device performance with the optimized multilayer electron transport material. The electronic properties like contact resistance, recombination resistance, flat-band potential and depletion width of the best performing device have been investigated. The interfacial charge transfer characteristics between methyl ammonium lead triiodide perovskite and low temperature solgel ZnO have also been elaborated based on the interface electronic properties.

Abstract: Effect of surface sulfurization on the solar conversion efficiency of Cu-Zn-Sn (CZT) alloy film, which was prepared by DC-magnetron sputtering with a single Cu-Zn-Sn target, followed by a H2S-sulfurization-after-H2Se-selenization (SAS) process to convert the alloy film to a Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorber, was investigated. Compared with a conventional Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) solar cell selenized in H2Se, the conversion efficiency of CZTSSe one prepared in the SAS process was increased from 2.1% to 7.5% (increased by 257%). Conductive atomic force microscopy exhibited that the SAS process effectively reduced the leakage current near the grain boundary, while the external quantum efficiency measurement clearly demonstrated that the SAS process increased the energy bandgap by ~0.13eV and significantly reduced the surface defects in the shorter wavelength region. Raman and temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopies elucidated that the SAS process also led to secondary phases (e.g., SnS, ZnS and Cu2SnS3) and structural defects (e.g., ZnSn), which are considered to be a key to achieve a highly efficient CZTSSe solar cell in the future.

Abstract: Cardiac stem cells (CSCs) have emerged as promising cell candidates to regenerate damaged hearts, because of the potential in differentiating to cardiomyocytes. However, the differentiation is difficult to trigger without inducers. Here we reported that β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) increased the expression of cardiac transcription factors (Nkx2.5 and GATA4), structural proteins (cardiac Troponin T, cTnt), transcriptional enhancer (Mef2c) and induced GATA4 nucleus translocation in adult resident CSCs, thus β-CD could be used to enhance myogenic transition. As the differentiation process was accompanied by autophagy, we constructed the Atg5 knockdown cell line by using the Atg5 siRNA lentivirus, and the myogenic conversion was blocked in Atg5 knockdown cells, which suggested that β-CD induces the cardiomyocytes transition of resident CSCs through autophagy. Furthermore, we found that JNK/STAT3 and GSK3β/β-catenin was the downstream pathways of β-CD-induced autophagy and differentiation using the inhibitors. Moreover, β-CD performed its functions through improving intracellular cholesterol levels and affecting cholesterol efflux. Collectively, our results reveal that β-CD as a novel tool to induce myogenic transition of CSCs, which could mobilize the resident CSCs or used together with CSCs to enhance the therapy effects of CSCs on damaged hearts. In addition, the clarified molecular mechanisms supported the new targets for inducing cardiomyocyte differentiation.

Abstract: Solar cooling technology is an attractive way to use solar thermal energy to produce cooling for buildings. The employment of taphase change materials (PCMs) as heat storage medium, to increase the range of utilization of solar thermal energy, thus improving the overall system performance, is considered very attractive. Nevertheless, in order to allow the development of latent heat storage prototypes for such an application, it is mandatory to verify the thermo-physical performance as well as the long-term stability of the available materials. To this aim, in the present paper, the most attractive commercial PCM as well as neat chemical compounds operating in the temperature range between 80°C and 100°C, perfectly suitable for non-concentrating solar cooling systems, have been identified and completely characterized. In particular, several cycles have been performed on each material, to verify possible instabilities in their behavior. Most of the neat materials have confirmed to be promising for this application, thanks to their really high melting enthalpy, up to 255J/g as showed for Aluminum Ammonium Sulfate Dodecahydrate. Nevertheless, all these materials are still not stable, showing high supercooling, allotropic phase transition, incongruent melting and even absence of re-crystallization, which makes necessary an intense work to bring them to a reliability level sufficient for real application. On the contrary, the commercial PCMs, even if mostly characterized by lower melting enthalpy, ranging between 120 and 150J/g, confirmed their stability, which makes them ready for practical applications.

Abstract: The export of membrane proteins along the secretory pathway is initiated at the endoplasmic reticulum after proteins are folded and packaged inside this organelle by their recruiting into the coat complex COPII vesicles. It is proposed that cargo receptors are required for the correct transport of proteins to its target membrane, however, little is known about ER export signals for cargo receptors. Erv14/Cornichon belong to a well conserved protein family in Eukaryotes, and have been proposed to function as cargo receptors for many transmembrane proteins. Amino acid sequence alignment showed the presence of a conserved acidic motif in the C-terminal in homologues from plants and yeast. Here, we demonstrate that mutation of the C-terminal acidic motif from ScErv14 or OsCNIH1, did not alter the localization of these cargo receptors, however it modified the proper targeting of the plasma membrane transporters Nha1p, Pdr12p and Qdr2p. Our results suggest that mistargeting of these plasma membrane proteins is a consequence of a weaker interaction between the cargo receptor and cargo proteins caused by the mutation of the C-terminal acidic motif.

Abstract: In this study strong evidence for an illumination-induced change in minority charge carrier diffusion length is given for Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. After annealing under illumination (light soaking) the cells show the well-known metastable increase in open circuit voltage, but also a metastable reduction in current collection efficiency (which can be reversed by annealing in the dark). Partly, this can be attributed to an increase in doping density causing a reduced space charge region width as verified by capacitance-voltage profiling. Nevertheless, by using time-resolved photoluminescence and electron-beam-induced current measurements we found that the changes in doping density and space charge region width are not sufficient to describe the modification in current collection efficiency. Additionally there seems to be a reduction in minority carrier diffusion length and lifetime after white light soaking. This can be explained by a metastable change of electronic defects as found in temperature-dependent admittance spectroscopy. Device simulations confirm the impact of the found defects on the photocurrent.

Abstract: In LNCaP cells that stably express α1A-adrenergic receptors, oxymetazoline increased intracellular calcium and receptor phosphorylation, however, this agonist was a weak partial agonist, as compared to noradrenaline, for calcium signaling. Interestingly, oxymetazoline-induced receptor internalization and desensitization displayed greater effects than those induced by noradrenaline. Phorbol myristate acetate induced modest receptor internalization and minimal desensitization. α1A-Adrenergic receptor interaction with β-arrestins (colocalization/coimmunoprecipitation) was induced by noradrenaline and oxymetazoline and, to a lesser extent, by phorbol myristate acetate. Oxymetazoline was more potent and effective than noradrenaline in inducing ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. Mass spectrometric analysis of immunopurified α1A-adrenergic receptors from cells treated with adrenergic agonists and the phorbol ester clearly showed that phosphorylated residues were present both at the third intracellular loop and at the carboxyl tail. Distinct phosphorylation patterns were observed under the different conditions. The phosphorylated residues were: a) Baseline and all treatments: T233; b) noradrenaline: S220, S227, S229, S246, S250, S389; c) oxymetazoline: S227, S246, S381, T384, S389; and d) phorbol myristate acetate: S246, S250, S258, S351, S352, S401, S402, S407, T411, S413, T451. Our novel data, describing the α1A-AR phosphorylation sites, suggest that the observed different phosphorylation patterns may participate in defining adrenoceptor localization and action, under the different conditions examined.

Abstract: Finding the optimal morphology of novel organic photovoltaic (OPV) polymer blends is a major obstacle slowing the development of more efficient OPV devices. With a focus on accelerating the systematic morphology optimisation process, we demonstrate a technique offering rapid high-resolution, 3-dimensional blend morphology analysis in the scanning electron microscope. This backscattered electron imaging technique is used to investigate the morphological features and length-scales defining the promising PffBT4T-2OD:PC70BM blend system and show how its photovoltaic performance is related to the nature of its phase separation. Low-voltage backscattered electron imaging can be used to probe for structure and domain stacking through the thickness of the film, as well as imaging surface morphology with highly competitive spatial resolution. For reference, we compare our results with equivalent images of the widely studied P3HT:PC60BM blend system. Our results also demonstrate that backscattered electron imaging offers significant advantages over conventional cross-sectional imaging techniques, and show that it enables a fast, systematic approach to control 3-dimensional active layer morphology in polymer:fullerene blends.

Abstract: Nickel galvanic displacement (NiGD) plating to silicon surfaces allows for the deposition of self-limiting sub-micron nickel layers. This paper reports the use of NiGD plating as an adhesion-promoting seed layer for light-induced plated nickel and copper (LIP-NiCu) contacts on chemically-etched silicon surfaces. The improved adhesion, which is attributed to surface roughening caused by the oxidation and subsequent etching of silicon in the fluoride-containing electrolyte, is quantified by stylus-based scratch measurements and shown to increase with the duration of sintering at 350°C. The width-normalised cut-off force for NiGD layers, sintered for 10min, was approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 114±32N/mm. Unsintered NiGD and sintered LIP-only control samples, plated onto similar chemically-etched silicon surfaces, were insufficiently adherent to be measured. The poor adhesion of the unsintered NiGD contacts was attributed to the formation of voids and an oxide-rich interface layer during the galvanic displacement process. Although sintering at 350°C appeared to reduce the thickness of the interfacial oxide and eliminate the voids, the oxide was not totally removed and contributed to the measured contact resistance of sintered NiGD-treated contacts of ~ 15mΩ cm2 being more than an order of magnitude higher than laser-ablated LIP-NiCu contacts on a similar n-type emitter surface. Adhesion priming layers formed using NiGD were used to metallise selective-emitter cells patterned using aerosol jet etching and having planarised contact regions. Although the LIP-NiCu contact grid was strongly adherent, the average area-normalised series resistance (Rs) was 0.96±0.18Ωcm2, the majority of which is attributed to high contact resistance arising from a residual interfacial oxide.

Abstract: Increasing evidence indicates that the tumor microenvironment is a critical factor supporting cancer progression, chemoresistance and metastasis. Recently, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been recognized as a crucial tumor stromal component promoting cancer growth and invasiveness via modulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) structure, tumor metabolism and immune reprogramming. One of the main sources of CAFs are endothelial cells undergoing the endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). EndMT is mainly promoted by the Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) family secreted by tumor cells, though the role of particular members in EndMT regulation remains poorly understood. Our findings demonstrate that TGF-β2 induces mesenchymal transdifferentiation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1 cells) to CAF-like cells in association with elongated cell morphology, modulation of stress fiber organization, higher α-SMA protein levels and activation of RhoA and Rac-1 pathways. Such regulation is similar to that observed in cells maintained using conditioned medium from invasive colorectal cancer cell line culture. Furthermore, TGF-β2 stimulation resulted in myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) activation and upregulation. Our results demonstrate for the first time that such interaction is sufficient for integrin-linked kinase (ILK) overexpression. ILK upregulation also enhanced MRTF activation via RhoA and Rac-1-MMP9 via inside-out integrin activation. Herein, we propose a new ILK-MMP9-MRTF axis that appears to be critical for EndMT differentiation of endothelial to CAF-like cells. Thus, it might be an attractive target for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neuron development. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we revealed that thyroid hormone treatment evokes significant calcium entry through canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels in ventral midbrain neural stem cells and this calcium signaling is essential for thyroid hormone-dependent DA neuronal differentiation. We also found that TRPC1 is the dominant TRPC channel expressed in ventral midbrain neural stem cells which responds to thyroid hormone. In addition, thyroid hormone increases TRPC1 expression through its receptor alpha 1 during DA neuron differentiation, and, importantly, produces calcium signals by activating TRPC1 channels. In vivo and in vitro gene silencing experiments indicate that TRPC1-mediated calcium signaling is required for thyroid hormone-dependent DA neuronal differentiation. Finally, we confirmed that the activation of OTX2, a determinant of DA neuron development and the expression of which is induced by thyroid hormone, is dependent on TRPC1-mediated calcium signaling. These data revealed the molecular mechanisms of how thyroid hormone regulates DA neuron development from ventral midbrain neural stem cells, particularly endowing a novel physiological relevance to TRPC1 channels.

Abstract: The three-step H2Se/Ar/H2Se reaction of CuInGa precursors for preparing high-quality CuInGaSe2 thin films is extensively used to control their composition and adhesion. In this work, a non-toxic, low-cost, solid Se source is used instead of toxic H2Se gas to selenize electrodeposited Cu/In/Ga precursors by the three-step vapor Se/N2/vapor Se reaction. Experimental results reveal that the Se content of the film in the first selenization step importantly affects the Ga distribution. Incomplete selenization (0.74<Se/Metal<0.96) in the first selenization step favors subsequent Ga diffusion. The second annealing step in inert gas atmosphere generates significant grain growth with Ga re-diffusion and does not change the composition in comparison with the first step treatment. The third selenization step in Se vapor atmosphere does not cause a significant additional change in the Ga distribution or microstructure of the film, but it causes Ga depletion at the top surface. Finally, CIGS solar cells on stainless steel substrate were fabricated using the three-step reaction and devices with efficiency=8.23% and VOC=434mV were produced by a preliminary process parameter optimization.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is the most important cause of dementia but there is no therapy that has been demonstrated to stop or slow disease progression. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the source of amyloid-β (Aβ), which aggregates in Alzheimer's disease to form toxic oligomeric species. The endo-lysosomal system can clear APP and Aβ from the cell if these molecular species are trafficked through to the lysosome. Currently, there are no easy methods available for the analysis of lysosomal APP trafficking. We therefore generated a fusion protein (tandem-fluorescent, or tf-APP) that allows detection of changes in APP trafficking using accessible techniques such as flow cytometry. This permits rapid analysis or screening of genes and compounds that alter APP processing in the cell. Using our novel molecular probe, we determined that starvation induces trafficking of APP and APP-carboxy-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) to the degradative endo-lysosomal network. In line with this finding, suppression of mTOR signalling using AZD8055 also strongly induced trafficking of APP to the endo-lysosomal system. Remarkably, activation of mTOR signalling via RHEB over-expression inhibited the starvation-induced autophagy but did not affect trafficking of tf-APP. These results show tf-APP can be used to determine how APP is trafficked through the lysosomal system of the cell. This molecular probe is therefore useful for determining the molecular mechanism behind the commitment of APP to the degradative pathway or for screening compounds that can induce this effect. This is important as clearance of APP and APP-CTF provides an important potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Extravasation is a rate-limiting step of tumor metastasis, for which adhesion to endothelium of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is the prerequisite. The suspension state of CTCs undergoing detachment from primary tumor is a persistent biomechanical cue, which potentially regulates the biophysical characteristics and cellular behaviors of tumor cells. In this study, breast tumor cells MDA-MB-231 in suspension culture condition were used to investigate the effect of suspension state on reattachment of CTCs. Our study demonstrated that suspension state significantly increased the adhesion ability of breast tumor cells. In addition, suspension state markedly promoted the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions and reduced the motility in reattached breast cancer cells. Moreover, lamin A/C was reversibly accumulated at posttranscriptional level under suspension state, improving the cell stiffness of reattached breast cancer cells. Disruption of actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D caused lamin A/C accumulation. Conversely, decreasing actomyosin contraction by ROCK inhibitor Y27632 reduced lamin A/C level. Knocking down lamin A/C weakened the suspension-induced increase of adhesion, and also abolished the suspension-induced decrease of motility and increase of stress fibers and focal adhesion in reattaching tumor cells, suggesting a crucial role of lamin A/C. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that suspension state promoted the reattachment of breast tumor cells by up-regulating lamin A/C via cytoskeleton disruption. These findings highlight the important role of suspension state for tumor cells in tumor metastasis.

Abstract: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) plays a crucial role in regulating myeloid cell survival, proliferation, and neutrophilic granulocyte precursor cells maturation. Previously, we demonstrated that Fbw7α negatively regulates G-CSFR and its downstream signaling through ubiquitin–proteasome mediated degradation. However, whether additional ubiquitin ligases for G-CSFR exist is not known. Identifying multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases for G-CSFR shall improve our understanding of activation and subsequent attenuation of G-CSFR signaling required for differentiation and proliferation. Here, for the first time we demonstrate that E6 associated protein (E6AP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase physically associates with G-CSFR and targets it for ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation and thereby attenuates its functions. We further show that E6AP promoted G-CSFR degradation leads to reduced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) which is required for G-CSF dependent granulocytic differentiation. More importantly, our finding shows that E6AP also targets mutant form of G-SCFR (G-CSFR-T718), frequently observed in severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) patients that very often culminate to AML, however, at a quite slower rate than wild type G-CSFR. In addition, our data showed that knockdown of E6AP restores G-CSFR and its signaling thereby promoting granulocytic differentiation. Collectively, our data demonstrates that E6AP facilitates ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of G-CSFR leading to attenuation of its downstream signaling and inhibition of granulocytic differentiation.

Abstract: We fabricated hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H) transparent solar cells using ultrathin transparent multi-layered electrodes (TMEs) as rear-side transparent electrodes for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) windows. Each TME included a bottom layer, thin Ag layer, and optoelectronic controlling layer (OCL). The TMEs were experimentally designed to have high transparency and conductance. The fabricated a-Si:H transparent solar cells showed optimal performance with a 6.36% power-conversion efficiency and 23.5% average transmittance (500–800nm) when TMEs with a thickness less than 160nm were incorporated. We demonstrated that the reflection color of the cell could be tuned without serious loss of cell efficiency by varying the thickness of the OCL. The backside colors were predicted to be the coordinates on a CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram using the reflection spectrum from the cell and emission spectrum of a 50W LED light source. The developed a-Si:H transparent solar cells exhibited high efficiency and show feasibility for incorporating various colors in the photovoltaic and aesthetic functionalities of BIPV windows.

Abstract: The impact of the anodization process of anodic aluminum oxide fabrication and post-deposition anneal on effective carrier lifetime of Si nanowires are reported. The anodization process with suitable switched-off anodization currents results in enhanced effective carrier lifetime of Si nanowires that are significantly higher than that of early and late switched-off anodization currents. Furthermore, the anodic aluminum oxide template exhibits an efficient passivation upon post-deposition anneal, yielding a maximum value of 228μs under thermal treatment at 650°C. First fabrication of Si nanowire solar cell embedded with anodic aluminum oxide template was carried out. Through post-deposition anneal prior to the fabrication of Si nanowire solar cells, the performance of Si nanowire solar cells was significantly improved. This established the impact of thermal treatment on opto-electronic characteristics of Si nanowires embedded with anodic aluminum oxide.

Abstract: Epigenetic factors and related small molecules have emerged to be strongly involved in autophagy process. Here we report that 2-PCPA and GSK-LSD1, two inhibitors of histone H3K4 demethylase KDM1A/LSD1, induce autophagy in multiple mammalian cell lines. The two small molecules induce accumulation of LC3II, formation of autophagosome and autolysosome, and SQSTM1/p62 degradation. 2-PCPA treatment inhibits cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest but does not inducing cell death. Exogenous expression of KDM1A/LSD1 impaired the autophagic phenotypes triggered by 2-PCPA. The autophagy induced by 2-PCPA requires LC3-II processing machinery. But depletion of BECN1 and ULK1 with siRNA did not affect the LC3-II accumulation triggered by 2-PCPA. 2-PCPA treatment induces the change of global gene expression program, including a series of autophagy-related genes, such as SQSTM1/p62. Taken together, our data indicate that KDM1A/LSD1 inhibitors induce autophagy through affecting the expression of autophagy-related genes and in a BECN1-independent manner.

Abstract: The beta3 adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) stimulation plays a protective role against preterm labor by blocking myometrial contraction, cytokine production, remodeling and apoptosis. We previously demonstrated that macrophage-induced ROS production in the myometrium was a key element leading to the induction of all these labor-associated features. We thus aimed to investigate if the β3-AR could be expressed in human macrophages and could trigger its protective role in the myometrium by directly inhibiting ROS production. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated myometrial samples and cell co-culture experiments, we demonstrated that β3-AR stimulation inhibits the activation of the NADPH oxidase, leading to the subsequent inhibition of ROS production by macrophages. This antioxidant effect was associated with a potent anti-inflammatory response in macrophages. Furthermore, we observed that β3-AR leads to the expression of catalase not only in macrophages but also in myometrial cells, thereby preventing the transactivation of myometrial cells by hydrogen peroxide. Pharmacological experiments allowed us to demonstrate that these effects were driven by an Erk1/2-mediated activation of the antioxidant transcription factor PPARγ. These results suggest that β3-AR protective effects in the myometrium could be due to its dual antioxidant properties. Further, the effects observed in a macrophage could highlight new applications in chronic inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: The ABCA3 lipid transporter is located in the limiting membrane of lamellar bodies (LBs) in type-II-pneumocytes. Mutations within the ABCA3 gene may functionally impair the transporter, causing lung diseases in newborns, children and adults. Assays to quantify volume and lipid filling of the LBs on the level of the vesicular structures and thereby assess the function of ABCA3 are still lacking. In the present study human influenza haemagglutinin- (HA-) tagged wild type and mutant ABCA3 proteins were stably expressed in lung A549 cells. Fluorescently-labelled TopFluor phosphatidylcholine (TopF-PC) incorporated in surfactant-like liposomes was delivered to the cells and visualized by confocal microscopy. Subsequently, a comprehensive image analysis method was applied to quantify volume and fluorescence intensity of TopF-PC in ABCA3-HA-positive vesicles. TopF-PC accumulated within the vesicles in a time and concentration-dependent manner, whereas the volume remained unchanged, suggesting active transport into preformed ABCA3 containing vesicles. Furthermore, this finding was supported by a decrease of the fluorescence intensity within the vesicles when either the ATPase of the transporter was inhibited by vanadate, or when a disease-causing mutation (K1388N) close to the ABCA3-nucleotide binding domain 2 was introduced. Conversely, a mutation (E292V) located in the first cytoplasmic loop of ABCA3 did not significantly affect lipid transport, but rather resulted in smaller vesicles. In addition to these findings, the assay used in this work for analysing the PC-lipid transport into ABCA3 positive vesicles will be useful to screen for compounds susceptible to restore function in mutated ABCA3 protein.

Abstract: Intestinal epithelial cells form a protective barrier in limiting gut luminal content potentially harmful to the host. Upon gut epithelium injury, several signals instruct epithelial cells to undergo a rapid healing process. Defects in this process induce inflammatory responses and can further evolve into chronic gut inflammatory diseases. We previously identified the transcription factor CUX1 as crucial for protecting against experimental colitis in mice. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which CUX1 intervenes during this biological process are unknown. Our aim was to evaluate CUX1 biological and functional roles during intestinal epithelial cell wound healing. RNAi knockdown of CUX1 in intestinal epithelial cells revealed a crucial role for this regulator in migratory response following wounding assays. Gene expression profiling identified several gene transcripts modulated in absence of CUX1 during wound healing for which a significant number was associated with cell motility and cytoskeleton function. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2 gene as a direct target for CUX1. Coincidently, reduction of VAV2 in absence of CUX1 was associated with a significant decrease of RAC1 activity in response to epithelial wounding. Our results identify a novel pathway by which CUX1 regulates normal intestinal epithelial cell restitution.

Abstract: Accumulating evidences indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) might play important roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition) is considered as a critical step in invasion and metastasis of various tumors including bladder cancer (BC). Recent researches have showed that lncRNA H19 is implicated in metastasis through regulating EMT and the reverse MET (mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition). However, underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we screened lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles of BC with microarray assay. We found that H19 and DNMT3B displayed a higher co-expression in BC tissues and cells. Functionally, we demonstrated that H19 could increase proliferation, invasion and migration, regulate EMT as well as rearrange cytoskeleton of BC cells in vitro. Moreover, ectopic expression of H19 promoted tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and pulmonary metastasis in vivo, whereas knockdown of H19 has a contrary role in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we proved that H19 could directly bind to miR-29b-3p (miR-29b) and derepress the expression of target DNMT3B. H19 and miR-29b-3p showed a co-localization. More importantly, up-regulating H19 antagonized miR-29b-3p-mediated proliferation, migration and EMT suppression in BC cells. Furthermore, H19 knockdown partially reversed the function of miR-29b-3p inhibitor on DNMT3B and facilitated miR-29b-3p-induced MET. Taken together, we demonstrated for the first time that H19 might function as ceRNA (competing endogenous RNA) for miR-29b-3p and relieve the suppression for DNMT3B, which led to EMT and metastasis of BC. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism of H19 in progression of BC and provide H19/miR-29b-3p/DNMT3B axis as a promising therapeutic target for BC.

Abstract: The mechanism by which cell shape regulates the function of the cell is one of the most important biological issues, but it remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of the regulation of cell shape on proliferation by using a micropatterning approach to confine MC3T3-E1 cells into specific shapes. Our results show that the proliferation rate for rectangle-, triangle-, square- and circle-shaped osteoblasts increased sequentially and was related to the nuclear shape index (NSI) but not the cell shape index (CSI). Interestingly, intracellular calcium transients also displayed different patterns, with the number of Ca2+ peaks increasing with the NSI in shaped cells. Further causal investigation revealed that the gene expression levels of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2 (SERCA2), two major calcium cycling proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), were increased with an increase in NSI as a result of nuclear volume changes. Moreover, the down-regulation of IP3R1 and/or SERCA2 using shRNAs in circle-shaped or control osteoblasts resulted in changes in intracellular calcium transient patterns and cell proliferation rates towards that of smaller-NSI-shaped cells. Our results indicate that changes in cell shape changed nuclear morphology and then the gene expression of IP3R1 and SERCA2, which produced different intracellular calcium transient patterns. The patterns of intracellular calcium transients then determined the proliferation rate of the shaped osteoblasts.

Abstract: The NF-κB family of transcription factors is essential for an effective immune response, but also controls cell metabolism, proliferation and apoptosis. Its broad relevance and the high connectivity to diverse signaling pathways require a tight control of NF-κB activity. To investigate the control of NF-κB activity by phosphorylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit, we generated a knock-in mouse model in which serine 467 (the mouse homolog of human p65 serine 468) was replaced with a non-phosphorylatable alanine (S467A). This substitution caused reduced p65 protein synthesis and diminished TNFα-induced expression of a selected group of NF-κB-dependent genes. Intriguingly, high-fat fed S467A mice displayed increased locomotor activity and energy expenditure, which coincided with a reduced body weight gain. Although glucose metabolism or insulin sensitivity was not improved, diet-induced liver inflammation was diminished in S467A mice. Altogether, this study demonstrates that phosphorylation of p65 serine 467 augment NF-κB activity and exacerbates various deleterious effects of overnutrition in mice.

Abstract: Multicellular Tumor Spheroids develop a heterogeneous micromilieu and different cell populations, thereby constituting a cancer model with intermediate characteristics between in vitro bi-dimensional cultures and in vivo tumors. Multicellular Tumor Spheroids also acquire tumor aggressiveness features due to transcription modulation of coding and non-coding RNA. Utilizing microarray analyses, we evaluated the microRNAs expression profile in MCF-7 breast cancer cells cultured as Multicellular Tumor Spheroids. The expression data was used to predict associated cellular and molecular functions using different software tools. The biological importance of two dysregulated miRNAs (miR-221-3p and miR-187) was studied by functional assays. Finally, the clinical relevance of these dysregulated miRNAs was explored using previously reported data. Thirty-three dysregulated microRNAs were found in MCF-7 Multicellular Tumor Spheroids. miRNA expression changes were closely linked with growth, proliferation, and cell development. miRNA-221-3p and miR-187 were implicated in the acquisition of migration/invasion capacities, sensitivity to the deprivation of growth factors, cell cycle phase regulation, and cell death. A panel of 5 miRNAs, including miR-187, showed a good predictive value in discriminating between low and high-risk groups of breast cancer.

Abstract: The research describes the synthesis, optical, photocatalytic, electrochemical and photoelectrocatalytical properties of highly defected, low surface area, tubular SiO2. High surface density of light-absorbing defects is obtained by conducting the synthesis at low temperature (0°C) and by optimizing the ratios between reactants. The calcined tubular SiO2 is characterized by intense and broad absorption band centered at ≈320nm, spanning from deep UV to green. The formation of Si3+ surface defects by calcination is accompanied by a substantial intensification of light absorbing characteristics. The annealing leads also to appearance of intense photoluminescence bands centered at around 433 and 533nm for excitation wavelengths 320–380nm. The photocatalytic generation of H2 and CO2 from water-methanol mixture under solar (AM 1.5) and visible (λ>390nm) irradiation is performed to probe the capability of light-absorbing defects of SiO2 to work as active sites and to gather indirect information on nature of active sites. The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical activity of tubular SiO2 are highlighted by employing [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 complex as electron transfer witness. According to our results, highly defected nanotubular SiO2 exhibit uncommon optical, light harvesting, electronic and electrochemical properties with great potential for practical applications in numerous fields.

Abstract: The combination of thermionic and photoelectric emission for solar energy conversion has been studied for years. There are two concepts for this synergistic process: hot electron conversion (HEC), which supposes that the excited carriers equilibrate among themselves, and photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE), which is based on the excited electrons' complete thermalization with the material. Here we present a new concept, thermally enhanced external photoelectric emission (TEPE), which describes the synergistic process under the photoelectric emission model. An experimental setup was applied and a photodiode with a bialkali cathode was tested. A conversion efficiency of 1.97×10−2% under 400nm illumination at 20°C was achieved, and a double enhancement of the efficiency was observed with the temperature rising to 70°C. Although the conversion efficiencies were small, the experiment demonstrates the energy conversion based on external photoelectric emission and the enhancement effect of heat.

Abstract: Oriented and high–density CdS nanorod arrays are successfully embedded in CdTe absorbing layers by facile and low–cost hydrothermal method and electrodeposition method. The structural, optical and electrical properties of these samples are examined, and the results demonstrate that the high quality three–dimensional heterostructure is obtained. Further investigations reveal that the three–dimensional heterostructure possesses superior optical absorption property to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency due to the optical scattering from the nanorod array. In addition, photovoltaic property measurements demonstrate that the energy conversion efficiency of the novel three–dimensional heterojunction solar cell is increased by 18.5% in comparison to the standard planar heterojunction solar cell. The observed improvement is mostly attributed to the three–dimensional heterostructure enabling enhanced optical absorption ability, increased heterojunction area and improved charge carrier collection. This study demonstrates that the three–dimensional heterostructure has a potential application in thin film solar cells, and the solution process represents a promising technique for large–scale fabrication of these novel solar cells.

Abstract: Doxorubicin (DOX) is a chemotherapic agent that is widely used to treat hematological and solid tumors. Despite its efficacy, DOX displays significant cardiac toxicity associated with cardiomyocytes death and heart failure. Cardiac toxicity is mainly associated with the ability of DOX to alter mitochondrial function. The current lack of treatments to efficiently prevent DOX cardiotoxicity underscores the need of new therapeutic approaches. Our current findings show that stimulation of cardiomyocytes with the α1-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist phenylephrine (PE) significantly inhibits the apoptotic effect of DOX. Importantly, our results indicate that AKAP-Lbc is critical for transducing protective signals downstream of α1-ARs. In particular, we could show that suppression of AKAP-Lbc expression by infecting primary cultures of ventricular myocytes with lentiviruses encoding AKAP-Lbc specific short hairpin (sh) RNAs strongly impairs the ability of PE to reduce DOX-induced apoptosis. AKAP-Lbc-mediated cardiomyocyte protection requires the activation of anchored protein kinase D1 (PKD1)-dependent prosurvival pathways that promote the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 and inhibit the translocation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax to mitochondria. In conclusion, AKAP-Lbc emerges as a coordinator of signals that protect cardiomyocytes against the toxic effects of DOX.

Abstract: Organic/inorganic nanocomposites composed of a ploy(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) film and TiO2 nanotubes or ZnO-coated TiO2 (ZnO/TiO2) nanotubes were fabricated and the influence of the inorganic nanostructures on the optical properties correlated with their photoactivity was studied. The structures of the organic/inorganic nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction and Raman backscattering spectroscopy. The optical properties were evaluated by measuring the optical absorption and photoluminescence. The TiO2 nanotubes exhibit anatase structure and the ZnO coating is structured with hexagonal wurtzite. The inorganic nanostructures are fully covered by the P3HT films with some P3HT infiltrating into the lacunas of the one-dimensional nanostructures. The P3HT-covered TiO2 NTs show strong optical absorption and present evident photoluminescence quenching. Nano-heterostructured ZnO/TiO2 NTs are superior to nanostructured TiO2 NTs in composing organic/inorganic nanocomposites with P3HT. The presence of a thin ZnO coating between the P3HT film and the TiO2 nanotubes further increases light absorption and quenches photoluminescence, revealing efficient generation of excitons by optical excitation and suppression of radiative recombination of photo-generated excitons, and suggesting that the organic/inorganic nanocomposite P3HT-covered ZnO/TiO2 nanotubes exhibits high photoactivity and an enhanced light harvesting efficiency can be anticipated. The temperature-dependent photoluminescence was also measured for an examination of π-stacking aggregation and a discussion of exciton coupling in P3HT at different temperatures.

Abstract: Bcs1p is a chaperone that is required for the incorporation of the Rieske subunit within complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mutations in the human gene BCS1L (BCS1-like) are the most frequent nuclear mutations resulting in complex III-related pathologies. In yeast, the mimicking of some pathogenic mutations causes a respiratory deficiency. We have screened chemical libraries and found that two antibiotics, pentamidine and clarithromycin, can compensate two bcs1 point mutations in yeast, one of which is the equivalent of a mutation found in a human patient. As both antibiotics target the large mtrRNA of the mitoribosome, we focused our analysis on mitochondrial translation. We found that the absence of non-essential translation factors Rrf1 or Mif3, which act at the recycling/initiation steps, also compensates for the respiratory deficiency of yeast bcs1 mutations. At compensating concentrations, both antibiotics, as well as the absence of Rrf1, cause an imbalanced synthesis of respiratory subunits which impairs the assembly of the respiratory complexes and especially that of complex IV. Finally, we show that pentamidine also decreases the assembly of complex I in nematode mitochondria. It is well known that complexes III and IV exist within the mitochondrial inner membrane as supramolecular complexes III2/IV in yeast or I/III2/IV in higher eukaryotes. Therefore, we propose that the changes in mitochondrial translation caused by the drugs or by the absence of translation factors, can compensate for bcs1 mutations by modifying the equilibrium between illegitimate, and thus inactive, and active supercomplexes.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis selectively in cancer cells without affecting the majority of normal human cells. However, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells often display resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Ibulocydine (IB) is an isobutyrate ester pro-drug of a novel synthetic Cdk inhibitor that targets Cdk7 and Cdk9. In this study, we show that treatment with subtoxic doses of IB in combination with TRAIL displays potent cytotoxicity in TRAIL-resistant human HCC cells. Combination of IB and TRAIL was found to synergistically induce apoptosis through activation of caspases, which was blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor (zVAD). Although the expression of Mcl-1 and survivin were reduced by IB plus TRAIL, overexpression of Mcl-1 and survivin did not block the cell death induced by co-treatment. Moreover, overexpression of Bcl-xL did not significantly interfere with the cell death induced by co-treatment of IB and TRAIL. Interestingly, the combination treatment induced cleavage of Bax, which was translocated to mitochondria upon induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, down-regulation of Bax by small interfering RNA effectively reduced the cell death and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) caused by co-treatment with IB and TRAIL. Finally, pre-treatment of HCC cells with a calpain inhibitor effectively blocked IB plus TRAIL-induced cleavage of Bax and apoptosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate that IB increases the sensitivity of human HCC cells to TRAIL via mitochondria signaling pathway mediated by calpain-induced cleavage of Bax, suggesting that combined treatment with IB and TRAIL may offer an effective therapeutic strategy for human HCC.

Abstract: Innovative WO3·2H2O/PEDOT films with strong adhesion of the electrochromic layer and the substrate were fabricated. A WO3·2H2O/PEDOT electrochromic layer can be firmly fixed to an ethylene vinyl acetate/polyethylene terephthalate (EVA/PET) electrode using Ag as the conductive layer by a transient heating method. The electrochromic film is mechanically robust and can be twisted, folded and crumpled without performance degeneration. Improved performance has been realized by WO3·2H2O/PEDOT films compared with WO3·2H2O films due to the excellent electrical conductivity of PEDOT, including a higher of Li-ion diffusion coefficient (1.1×10−9cm2s−1), faster response time (2.6s for bleaching time and 4.4s for coloration time), higher color efficiency (180.2cm2C−1) and larger transmittance modulation (63.1%) at 956nm. The results are very promising for the next generation of deformable or implantable hidden message displays and wearable smart clothes applications.

Abstract: The mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACPM/NDUFAB1) is a central element of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis type II machinery. Originally ACPM was detected as a subunit of respiratory complex I but the reason for the association with the large enzyme complex remained elusive. Complex I from the aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica comprises two different ACPMs, ACPM1 and ACPM2. They are anchored to the protein complex by LYR (leucine-tyrosine-arginine) motif containing protein (LYRM) subunits LYRM3 (NDUFB9) and LYRM6 (NDUFA6). The ACPM1-LYRM6 and ACPM2-LYRM3 modules are essential for complex I activity and assembly/stability, respectively. We show that in addition to the complex I bound fraction, ACPM1 is present as a free matrix protein and in complex with the soluble LYRM4(ISD11)/NFS1 complex implicated in Fe-S cluster biogenesis. We show that the presence of a long acyl chain bound to the phosphopantetheine cofactor is important for docking ACPMs to protein complexes and we propose that association of ACPMs and LYRMs is universally based on a new protein-protein interaction motif.

Abstract: The solar cell efficiency of solution processable CuInS2 inverted type solar cells in two different crystal structures of chalcopyrite and wurtzite are compared. The solvothermal process in assistance with pre-dissolving the precursors is used to control the crystalline phases and the electrophoretic deposition is utilized to deposit absorber layer. The XRD and Raman spectroscopies confirm the formation of chalcopyrite and wurtzite phases without any trace of impurity phases. The band gap of wurtzite phase is slightly higher than that of chalcopyrite phase. However, the wurtzite film consists of larger grains and lower porosity, which are beneficial in solar cell application. Furthermore, the chalcopyrite phase crystallizes in Cu-rich phase compared with the wurtzite phase with slightly Cu-rich compound which play a crucial role in higher carrier concentration of the absorber in the presence of high sulfur content. The inverted type solution processed chalcopyrite cell shows 5.31% efficiency (JSC of 14.90mA/cm2, VOC of 585mV, and FF of 0.61), which is enhanced up to 26% compared with the wurtzite cell and reaches 6.72% (JSC of 17.80mA/cm2, VOC of 590mV, and FF of 0.64).

Abstract: Dye-sensitized Solar Cells are generally known to possess a slow response to changes in photocurrent generation by incident light. Electrical power measurements of photovoltaic (PV) devices can only be accurately made if sufficient time is allowed for complete photocurrent generation. The generation time increases from typically a few milliseconds in the case of c-Si devices, over tens to hundreds of milliseconds for technologies like back-contact and hetero-junction solar cells, to even longer times for dye-sensitized and some types of perovskite solar cells. In this work we propose a procedure for calibration of slow responding PV devices based on an accurate evaluation of their response time. Starting from a quantitative analysis of the photocurrent signal versus chopping frequency on the spectral responsivity set-up, the measurement of a dye-sensitized solar cell was performed at 1Hz chopping frequency. Then current-voltage (I-V) measurements were performed at different sweep-times and directions, in order to determine the correct parameters for I-V characterization. Combining appropriate spectral responsivity (for determination and correction of spectral mismatch) and I-V measurements yielded a reliable calibration of the device including measurement uncertainty estimation. Based on this work criteria for a reliable calibration of slow responding PV devices are formulated, fulfilling all requirements specified in the standards (IEC 60904 series and IEC 60891).

Abstract: We report on the lifetime of unencapsulated organic photovoltaic diodes (OPVs) based on a ternary blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and a soft insulating polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as compared to reference binary P3HT:PCBM OPVs. The performance of ternary devices was shown to decay more slowly than that of their binary counterparts to an extent that depends on the relative humidity (RH). The power conversion efficiency of ternary OPVs when stored in a low humidity environment (1% RH) decayed to 80% of their initial value after 200h, almost double that of the reference binary OPVs. AFM measurements suggest that the PMMA forms pillars within the P3HT:PCBM matrix. It is proposed that the PMMA absorbs water in the active layer, and in doing so, slows the rate of deep trap formation that would otherwise lead to enhanced Shockley-Read-Hall recombination.

Abstract: The light-sensing rod photoreceptor cell exhibits several adaptations in response to the lighting environment. While adaptations to short-term changes in lighting conditions have been examined in depth, adaptations to long-term changes in lighting conditions are less understood. Atomic force microscopy was used to characterize the structure of rod outer segment disc membranes, the site of photon absorption by the pigment rhodopsin, to better understand how photoreceptor cells respond to long-term lighting changes. Structural properties of the disc membrane changed in response to housing mice in constant dark or light conditions and these adaptive changes required output from the phototransduction cascade initiated by rhodopsin. Among these were changes in the packing density of rhodopsin in the membrane, which was independent of rhodopsin synthesis and specifically affected scotopic visual function as assessed by electroretinography. Studies here support the concept of photostasis, which maintains optimal photoreceptor cell function with implications in retinal degenerations.

Abstract: In this work, hybrid bulk heterojunction solar cells based on surfactant-modified zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) blended with poly-(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) are presented. (E)-2-cyano-3-(5′-(4-(dibutylamino)styryl)-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)acrylic acid (1), a p-type semiconductor, is used as grafted interfacial surfactant on ZnO NRs, named 1-ZnO NRs, in order to improve simultaneously the nanoscale morphology of the hybrid polymer blend as well as the electronic properties of the heterojunction interface. Our studies reveal that the ligand modification of ZnO NRs leads to strongly improved aggregate free P3HT/ZnO blends that show five time increased power conversion efficiency and corresponding photo-generated charge carrier transport compared to untreated ZnO NRs. From transient absorption spectroscopy, it was found that recombination kinetics were similar in the device using untreated ZnO and modified 1-ZnO NRs, respectively, pointing to a major impact of the ligand in the improvement of the blend morphology. Corresponding device optimization led to improvements of FF and Voc to values comparable to P3HT blends using fullerene acceptors, but photocurrent density of the P3HT/1-ZnO solar cells was found low even after optimization. The latter could be addressed to destruction of long range organization of P3HT induced by the presence of the ZnO NRs as well as low electron transport inside the blend.

Abstract: A 100% solid, curable liquid encapsulant for photovoltaic modules was developed using acrylic/urethane hybrid chemistry. These liquid acrylics are easily coated and cured with polyisocyanates to form rubbery solids with tunable cure time, excellent optical properties, and UV stability for over 5000h of accelerated aging. Adhesion to a variety of substrates was good and remained high after aging as well. A variety of catalysts can be used for the curing reaction to tune pot life and cure time. The dielectric strength, surface resistivity, and volume resistivity are similar to commercial encapsulants, and the water vapor transmission rate is lower than EVA. The materials described herein are also useful as optically clear adhesives and potting agents.

Abstract: Ultra-low refractive index thin films suitable for practical antireflective (AR) applications must be highly transparent, economical, and durable against temperature and weather conditions. In this work, we present a high performance broad band antireflective coating using a facile synthesis of Ink-Bottle mesoporous MgF2 nanoparticles. The nanoparticles having high crystalline and dispersible properties were prepared by a deformation-reformation route from coarse commercial MgF2 hydrate powder by Lyothermal synthesis. These nanoparticles, after dispersion in a suitable solvent were used to develop a single layer AR coating by dip-coating technique. We precisely developed coatings tunable to achieve minimum reflection losses between 400 and 1500nm. The AR coating exhibited nearly 100% transmittance within visible range (615–660nm) and an average transmittance of 99% and 97% in the visible (400–800nm) and active solar range (300–1500nm) respectively. Further, use of the AR coating on PV glass led to a net improvement of 6% in efficiency for c-Si solar cells. This work opens a promising approach to improve the device performance of solar cells as well as solar collectors by developing broad band antireflective surfaces using mesoporous nanoparticles.

Abstract: Two different process approaches for growing high-performance multi-crystalline silicon (HPM-Si) material for photovoltaic applications are presented. Assisted nucleation was achieved by seeding on fine polycrystalline silicon chunks and on a rough silica crucible bottom, respectively. For each of the two methods industrially sized ingots of 650kg were directionally solidified. Wafers of these ingots and those from conventionally solidified multi-crystalline (mc) silicon ingots were used to produce solar cells on industrial line. Solar cell parameters were analyzed and compared. Both assisted nucleation methods are suitable for industrial growing of HPM-Si ingots. The grain size is more homogeneously distributed resulting in improved material quality. Less dislocation clustering results in higher average conversion efficiency of solar cells compared to those made of conventionally solidified mc-Si material. Moreover, it is also experimentally proven that assisted nucleation procedure is effective for both Siemens polysilicon feedstock and cheaper solar grade silicon. Further improvements of nucleation procedures, which can be used to achieve higher conversion solar cell efficiency and lower product cost, are proposed.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to report the effect of the solvent polarity on the adsorption of CdSe quantum dots (QDots) over the surface of TiO2 nanotubes and the influence of the coverage gained on the efficiency of photoanodes based on these materials. Particularly, it is shown that the amount of QDots adsorbed on TiO2 nanotubes can be tuned by using solvent mixtures of different polarity and volume ratios. An increase on QDots coverage was found when the polarity increases. What is noticeable is that the photoanode efficiency increased at a higher rate than the QDots coverage. For instance, a two-fold increase of coverage at a 50% acetone – 50% toluene ratio induces up to a seven-fold increase of the photocurrent values with respect to those obtained when the adsorption is performed from toluene. This effect is explained in terms of a different distribution of QDots along the nanotube walls depending on the solvent polarity used for the adsorption.

Abstract: Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for solar cells because their optoelectronic properties are easily adjusted by control of their size, structure and composition. We present calculations of the band gap and radiative lifetime for varying core diameter and shell thickness of CdSe/CdTe core/shell Type II CQDs using a combination of single particle (2,6)-band k·p and many-electron configuration interaction (CI) Hamiltonians. These calculations are validated by comparison with experimental absorption spectra and photoluminescence decay data. The results are then incorporated into a model of photovoltaic efficiency which demonstrates how the overall performance of a solar cell based on Type II CQDs is affected by changes in the core/shell geometry. The largest effect on photovoltaic efficiency is found to be due to the longer radiative lifetime produced by increasing the shell thickness.

Abstract: We present a large area trifunctional glass prototype combining a photo-electrochromic (PEC) device and an organic light-emitting diode (OLED), interfaced through a properly designed electronic control system. A 12×17cm2 PEC glass-on-glass module was realized, containing four dyesensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and a central electrochromic (EC) section deposited on the same glass panel. All PEC layers are screen-printed, including the mesoporous electrochromic layer, obtained from a custommade tungsten paste. DSSCs show an efficiency of 2.4%, while the coloration efficiency of the EC section reaches a value of 40 cm2C−1 at 700nm. A 10×8cm2 transparent white OLED was also realized, designed and tailored in order to unbalance the emission of light, i.e. maximizing the bottom emission. The efficiency of large area OLED section reaches 8cd A-1 in the operative conditions and without light outcoupling enhancement systems. The OLED device is clamped on the back of the PEC module and all sections are electrically connected to an external electronic control system. The energy collected by the DSSCs is stored in supercapacitors and used when requested, either applied to the EC section to produce a light shading effect in the daytime, or to the OLED for illumination at night.

Abstract: Theobromine, a methylxanthine derived from cacao beans, reportedly has various health-promoting properties but molecular mechanism by which effects of theobromine on adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to clarify the molecular mechanisms of the anti-adipogenic effect of theobromine in vitro and in vivo. ICR mice (4week-old) were administered with theobromine (0.1g/kg) for 7days. Theobromine administration attenuated gains in body and epididymal adipose tissue weights in mice and suppressed expression of adipogenic-associated genes in mouse adipose tissue. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, theobromine caused degradation of C/EBPβ protein by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Pull down assay showed that theobromine selectively interacts with adenosine receptor A1 (AR1), and AR1 knockdown inhibited theobromine-induced C/EBPβ degradation. Theobromine increased sumoylation of C/EBPβ at Lys133. Expression of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific protease 2 (SENP2) gene, coding for a desumoylation enzyme, was suppressed by theobromine. In vivo knockdown studies showed that AR1 knockdown in mice attenuated the anti-adipogenic effects of theobromine in younger mice. Theobromine suppresses adipocyte differentiation and induced C/EBPβ degradation by increasing its sumoylation. Furthermore, the inhibition of AR1 signaling is important for theobromine-induced C/EBPβ degradation.

Abstract: Mitochondrial (mt) tRNA gene mutations are an important cause of human morbidity and are associated with different syndromes. We have previously shown that the mitochondrial protein synthesis elongation factor EF-Tu and isolated sequences from the carboxy-terminal domain of yeast and human mt leucyl-tRNA synthetases (LeuRS), have a wide range of suppression capability among different yeast mt tRNA mutants having defective respiratory phenotype. Here we show that the rescuing capability can be restricted to a specific sequence of six amino acids from the carboxy-terminal domain of mt LeuRS. On the other hand by overexpressing a mutated version of mt EF-Tu in a yeast strain deleted for the endogenous nuclear gene we identified the specific region involved in suppression. Results support the possibility that a small peptide could correct defects associated with many mt tRNA mutations, suggesting a novel therapy for mitochondrial diseases treatment. The involvement of the mt EF-Tu in cellular heat stress response has also been suggested.

A new highly reproducible procedure for human breast cancer MCF-7 stem cells (BCSC) isolation and selection was developed by using a combination of hypoxia/hypoglycemia plus taxol and adriamycin for 24h. The BCSC enriched fraction (i) expressed (2–15 times) the typical stemness protein markers CD44+, ALDH1A3 and Oct 3/4; (ii) increased its clonogenicity index (20-times), invasiveness profile (>70%), migration capacity (100%) and ability to form mammospheres, compared to its non-metastatic MCF-7 counterpart. This isolation and selection protocol was successful to obtain stem cell enriched fractions from A549, SiHa and medulloblastoma cells. Since the secretion of HPI/AMF cytokine seems involved in metastasis, the effects of erytrose-4-phosphate (E4P) and 6-phosphogluconate (6PG), potent HPI inhibitors, on the acquisition of the breast stem cell-like phenotype were also evaluated. The presence of E4P during the BCSC selection deterred the development of the stemness phenotype, whereas both extracellular E4P (5–250nM) and 6PG (1μM) as well as siRNA HPI/AMF depressed the BCSC invasiveness ability (>90%), clonogenicity index (>90%) and contents (50–96%) of stemness (CD44, ALDH1A), pluripotency (p38 MAPK, Oct3/4, wnt/β-catenin) and EMT (SNAIL, MMP-1, vimentin) markers. The cytokine inhibitor repertaxin (10nM) or the anti-IL-8 or anti-TGF-β monoclonal antibodies (10μg/mL) did not significantly affect the BCSC metastatic phenotype. E4P also diminished (75%) the formation and growth of MCF-7 stem cell mammospheres. These results suggested that E4P by directly interacting with extracellular HPI/AMF may be an effective strategy to deter BCSC growth and progression.

Abstract: Mitochondria are multifunctional metabolic factories and integrative signaling organelles of eukaryotic cells. The structural basis for their numerous functions is a complex and dynamic double-membrane architecture. The outer membrane connects mitochondria to the cytosol and other organelles. The inner membrane is composed of a boundary region and highly folded cristae membranes. The evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) connects the two inner membrane domains via formation and stabilization of crista junction structures. Moreover, MICOS establishes contact sites between inner and outer mitochondrial membranes by interacting with outer membrane protein complexes. MICOS deficiency leads to a grossly altered inner membrane architecture resulting in far-reaching functional perturbations in mitochondria. Consequently, mutations affecting the function of MICOS are responsible for a diverse spectrum of human diseases. In this article, we summarize recent insights and concepts on the role of MICOS in the organization of mitochondrial membranes. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane Contact Sites edited by Christian Ungermann and Benoit Kornmann.

Abstract: We present the fabrication and characterization of two dimensional (2D) perovskites (PEA)2(MA)m-1PbmI3m+1 (PEA=phenylethylammonium, MA=methylammonium, m=1,2,3) for application as light absorbers in solar cells. Films of 2D perovskite series show high stability under humid air, with band gaps decreasing with increasing m values, from 2.36eV for (PEA)2PbI4 (m=1) to 1.94eV for (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (m=3). Owning to the smaller bandgap, favorable vertical growth characteristics, and appropriate energy band structure of (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10, planer perovskite solar cells based on (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 exhibit best cell performance. Incorporation of TiO2 nanorod arrays into (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I7 based perovskite solar cells are further found to be useful in improving the cell performance, ascribing to the improved quality and coverage of the perovskite films, as well as the enhanced electronic contact between the perovskites and the electron transporting layer. By optimizing the TiO2 NR lengths, an efficiency of 3.72% is obtained for (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 perovskite cells with 600nm-long TiO2NRs as scaffolds, which is more than a time higher than that of the planer analogue device. Our study to design 2D perovskite solar cells demonstrates the importance of material structure and device configuration for efficient solar cells, highlighting the validity of TiO2 nanorods in functionalizing 2D perovskites for photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: In addition to β-cells, pancreatic islets contain α- and δ-cells, which respectively produce glucagon and somatostatin. The reprogramming of these two endocrine cell types into insulin producers, as observed after a massive β-cell ablation in mice, may help restoring a functional β-cell mass in type 1 diabetes. Yet, the spontaneous α-to-β and δ-to-β conversion processes are relatively inefficient in adult animals and the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain unclear. Several studies indicate that the conserved chromatin modifiers DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2) are important for pancreas development and restrict islet cell plasticity. Here, to investigate the role of these two enzymes in α- and δ-cell development and fate maintenance, we genetically inactivated them in each of these two cell types. We found that loss of Dnmt1 does not enhance the conversion of α- or δ-cells toward a β-like fate. In addition, while Dnmt1 was dispensable for the development of these two cell types, we noticed a gradual loss of α-, but not δ-cells in adult mice. Finally, we found that Ezh2 inactivation does not enhance α-cell plasticity, and, contrary to what is observed in β-cells, does not impair α-cell proliferation. Our results indicate that both Dnmt1 and Ezh2 play distinct roles in the different islet cell types.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) is characterized by obstructive hyperproliferation and apoptosis resistance of distal pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). T-type Ca2+ channel blockers have been shown to reduce experimental pulmonary hypertension, although the impact of T-type channel inhibition remains unexplored in PASMCs from iPAH patients. Here we show that T-type channels Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 are present in the lung and PASMCs from iPAH patients and control subjects. The blockade of T-type channels by the specific blocker, TTA-A2, prevents cell cycle progression and PASMCs growth. In iPAH cells, T-type channel signaling fails to activate phosphatase PP2A, leading to an increase in ERK1/2, P38 activation. Moreover, T-type channel signaling is redirected towards the activation of the kinase Akt1, leading to increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin, and a decrease in the pro-apoptotic mediator FoxO3A. Finally, in iPAH cells, Akt1 is no longer able to regulate caspase 9 activation, whereas T-type channel overexpression reverses PP2A defect in iPAH cells but reinforces the deleterious effects of Akt1 activation. Altogether, these data highlight T-type channel signaling as a strong trigger of the pathological phenotype of PASMCs from iPAH patients (hyper-proliferation/cells survival and apoptosis resistance), suggesting that both T-type channels and PP2A may be promising therapeutic targets for pulmonary hypertension.

Abstract: Quantitative characterization of single cells already embedded in modules is performed by a combination of electroluminescence imaging and dark lock-in thermography. Electroluminescence imaging is used to determine the terminal voltages of single cells in modules, and dark lock-in thermography imaging enables the use of quantitative analyses of single solar cells with the software Local I-V 2. This combination yields spatially resolved images of the performance parameters of single cells. To check the reliability of the method also the directly measured voltages of the single cells in a module have been used for Local I-V evaluation and are compared to the results of Local I-V evaluation from voltages determined by EL. The accuracy of the voltage determination in our experiments is about ±1% compared to directly measured voltages, leading to an accuracy of the cell parameters such as J01, Uoc, efficiency, power, FF, and so on of about ±2% using the voltages determined by EL for the Local I-V analysis. With the method introduced it is possible to quantitatively identify the performance of single solar cells in modules reliably and non-destructively, thereby tracking quantitative changes of the cell performance due to degradation processes with high sensitivity and spatial resolution becomes possible.

Ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha promote glutamate transporter-1 endocytosis in astrocytes,

Abstract: Astrocytes, a stellate-shape glial population in the central nervous system (CNS), maintain glutamate homeostasis in adult CNS by undergoing glutamate uptake at the synapse through their glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) can be activated by endogenous saturated fatty acids to regulate astrocytic lipid metabolism and functions. However, it is unclear if PPARα can exert the regulatory action on GLT-1 expression in astrocytes. This study showed that treatment with palmitic acid (PA) and the other two PPARα agonists (GW 7647 and WY 14,643) caused no change in the morphology of astrocytes, whereas membranous GLT-1 protein levels in astrocytes were significantly decreased by PA and PPARα agonists. Through lentivirus-mediated overexpression of GLT-1 tagged with red fluorescent protein (GLT-1-RFP), we also observed that GLT-1-RFP puncta in the processes of astrocytes were inhibited by the PPARα agonists. This reduction was prevented by the addition of the PPARα antagonist, GW6471. GLT-1-RFP was co-localized to the early endosome marker–EEA1 in astrocytes treated with the PPARα agonists. Moreover, PPARα-induced inhibition in membranous GLT-1 expression was abolished by the addition of dynamin inhibitor (dynasore). Furthermore, the co-treatment of astrocytes with PPARα agonists and dynasore, or with PPARα agonists and protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bis-indolylmaleimide 1 (BIS1), prevented the endocytosis of GLT-1-RFP. Based on the results, we conclude that the PPARα agonists increased GLT-1 endocytosis in astrocytes possibly through the PKC signaling pathway. In addition, our findings provide important information of PPARα involvement in the downregulation of astrocytic glutamate uptake via the promoted GLT-1 endocytosis.

Abstract: The Melanocortin Receptor Accessory Protein 2 (MRAP2) regulates the activity of several GPCRs involved in the control of food intake and energy expenditure. While MRAP2 was originally thought to exclusively interact with melanocortin receptors we have recently shown that it interacts with and inhibits the trafficking and signaling of the prokineticin receptor 1 (PKR1). In this study we demonstrate a new role of MRAP2 in the regulation of the orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) and identify the specific regions of MRAP2 required for the regulation of OX1R and PKR1. Importantly, like MC4R and PKRs, OX1R is predominately expressed in the brain where it regulates food intake. By demonstrating that MRAP2 modulates the activity of OX1R we further establish the critical role of MRAP2 in the control of energy homeostasis.

Abstract: We demonstrate that, through formation of Zn1−xMgxO nanocrystal solid solution (NCSS) coupled with lead sulfide (PbS) nanocrystal (NC) of different size, optoelectronic properties of a donor-acceptor energy harvesting assembly can be probed and tuned. In the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PbS/Zn1−xMgxO/Al arrangement as a photovoltaic test probe, simultaneous tuning of Zn1−xMgxO NC solid solution (NCSS) and PbS NC in a narrow range in the energy levels is achieved altering the open circuit voltage and the short circuit current as measures of donor/acceptor interfacial electronic properties. With the Mg composition increasing, the energy band gap of the Zn1−xMgxO NCSS (acceptor) increases with its conduction band edge becoming closer to the lowest occupied molecular orbital level of the PbS NC (donor), increasing splitting of quasi-Fermi energy levels in the electron donor/acceptor assembly under illumination. More amount of Mg in the NCSS leads to transition from an energy level limited regime to a trap-induced charge transport limited regime, evidenced by a simultaneous decrease in the open circuit voltage and the short circuit current. This new finding provides insights of trade-off between the energy level off-set and the trap-induced charge transport degradation in engineering interfacial charge transfer and transport via formation of NCSS in integrating modern electronic devices.

Abstract: We investigated Schottky-type edge passivation of Si solar cells using Ag nanodots and the enhancement of cell conversion efficiency by improving the fill factor. The threshold voltage for the termination of photocurrent is increased by about 0.13V compared to the reference sample without edge passivation. The cross-section of the pn junction depletion region forms an Ag/Si Schottky contact in the depletion layer of the space and the image charges with a width of about 28nm. However, the p- and n-electrodes form Ohmic contacts with a contact depletion width of less than 5nm for the carrier tunneling process. The edge Schottky contact reduces the carrier recombination and saturation current at the surrounding edge region and enhances the fill factor and the pn junction property with increased shunt resistance, indicating that metallic edge passivation is an important process for large-scale Si solar cell fabrication.

Abstract: The degradation and durability of different selective solar absorbers surfaces in outdoor exposure testing (OET) sites with different atmospheric corrosivity (maritime/industrial and urban atmospheres) were investigated for the optimization of accelerated aging tests to the qualification in terms of durability of selective solar absorber coatings in different environments. Two Outdoor Exposure Testing (OET) sites were constructed, the climate was characterized and the atmospheric corrosivity categories were determined by corrosion rate measurements of standard specimens (carbon steel, zinc, copper and aluminium) during 12 months, according to ISO 9223, ISO 9225 and ISO 9226:2012. Two Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) coatings (commercially available) and three paint coatings (commercially available) were also exposed in the two OET sites with evaluation of degradation after 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months of exposure in terms of optical properties (solar absorptance and thermal emittance), morphology and chemical evaluation (SEM/EDS and XRD). The selective solar absorber surfaces submitted to OET sites for one year were ranked according to their performance in terms of optical properties and corrosion over time. The results obtained show the relevance of outdoor exposure testing sites, namely in places with high corrosivity as in marine and/or industrial areas as a reliable way to verify the corrosion resistance of new materials and products and the evolution of optical properties degradation of absorber surfaces in the presence of high concentration of contaminants.

Abstract: Among polymers used as encapsulant in photovoltaic (PV) modules, poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), or EVA, is the most widely used, for its low cost and acceptable performances. When exposed to weather conditions, EVA undergoes degradation that affects overall PV performances. Durability prediction of EVA, and thus of the module, is a hot topic in PV process industry. To date, the literature lacks of long-term predictive computational models to study EVA aging. To fill this gap, a computational framework, based on the finite element method, is proposed to simulate chemical reactions and diffusion processes occurring in EVA. The developed computational framework is valid in either case of environmental or accelerated aging. The proposed framework enables the identification of a correspondence between induced degradation in accelerated tests and actual exposure in weathering conditions. The developed tool is useful for the prediction of the spatio-temporal evolution of the chemical species in EVA, affecting its optical properties. The obtained predictions, related to degradation kinetics and discoloration, show a very good correlation with experimental data taken from the literature, confirming the validity of the proposed formulation and computational approach. The framework has the potential to provide quantitative comparisons of degradation resulting from any environmental condition to that gained from accelerated aging tests, also providing a guideline to design new testing protocols tailored for specific climatic zones.

Abstract: Activin A receptor type I or activin receptor-like kinase 2 (ACVRI/ALK2) belongs to type I TGF-β family and plays an important role in bone development. Activating mutations of ALK2 containing the R206 to H mutation, are present in 95% in the rare autosomal genetic disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), which leads to the development of ectopic bone formation in muscle. The effect of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation on ALK2R206H-mediated signaling in fibroblasts obtained from a FOP patient was assessed in the present study. The activity of the mutated ALK2 was suppressed by pharmacological AMPK activators such as metformin and aspirin, while their actions were blocked by the dominant negative mutant of AMPK and mimicked by the constitutively active mutant of AMPK. Furthermore, activation of AMPK upregulated Smad6 and Smurf1 and thereby enhanced their interactions, resulting in its proteosome-dependent degradation of ALK2. In contrast, knockdown of Smad6 or Smurf1 prevented metformin-induced reduction of ALK2. To evaluate the biological relevance of AMPK action on ALK2 activity, we induced FOP fibroblasts into iPS cells and found that their osteogenic differentiation in vitro was inhibited by metformin. Our studies provide novel insight into potential approaches to treatment of FOP, since several AMPK activators (e.g. metformin, berberine, and aspirin) are already in clinical use for the treatment of diabetes and metabolic syndromes.

Abstract: CdTe thin film solar cells have demonstrated efficiencies over 20%, but CdTe has a somewhat higher band gap than optimal for single-junction terrestrial solar-cell power generation. A reduction in the band gap could therefore result in an overall improvement in performance. To reduce the band gap, selenium was alloyed with CdTe using a novel co-sublimation extension of the close-space-sublimation process. Co-sublimated layers of CdSeTe with various selenium concentrations were characterized for optical absorption and atomic concentrations, as well as to track changes in their morphology and crystallinity. The lower band-gap CdSeTe films were then incorporated into the front of CdTe cells. This two-layer band-gap structure demonstrated higher current collection and increased quantum efficiency at longer wavelengths.

Abstract: Due to the potential of achieving high conductivity and high transparency, low-cost, large-area and flexibility for versatile applications as organic solar cells, silver nanowires (AgNWs) have attracted great attention as a good alternative to conventional ITO. However, design and production of conducting transparent film and interconnecting layers plays a very important role to achieve a high device performance. We discuss the benefit of the AgNWs inserted in the organic tandem solar cell devices as transparent electrode (TE) and as interconnecting layer (ICL) between the two subcells having actives layers with complementary absorption and made of poly(3-hexylthiophene):indene-C60 bisadduct and polythieno [3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene: phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester. ZnO nanoparticles have been used as interfacial layer in the ICL and lead to a decrease of the AgNWs roughness. The tandem cells on AgNWs show a good efficiency (PCE=9.23%), a short circuit current density of 11.23mA/cm2 close to the lower short circuit current of the two solar subcells, and an open circuit voltage (Voc=1.47V) matching the sum of the two subcells Voc. This suggests that the ICL provides a good carrier injection through the interfacial layer and an efficient recombination of the current coming from each subcells. Moreover, optical modeling is done in order to calculate the optimized active layers thicknesses and short term stability in open air evaluated.

Abstract: Maintaining a stable and balanced histone pool is of paramount importance for genome stability and fine regulation of DNA replication and transcription. This involves a complex regulatory machinery, exploiting transcription factors as well as histone chaperones, chromatin remodelers and modifiers. The functional details of this machinery are as yet unclear. Previous studies report histone decrease in mammalian and yeast HMGB family mutants. In this study we find that Nhp6 proteins, the S. cerevisiae HMGB1 homologues, control histone gene expression by affecting nucleosome stability at regulative regions of the histone clusters. In addition, we observe that histone gene overexpression in the nhp6ab mutant is accompanied by downregulated translation, which in turn is responsible for the histone decrease phenotype. Our observations allow us to incorporate Nhp6 proteins into the large group of chromatin factors that tightly regulate histone gene expression.

Abstract: Merlin (moesin-ezrin-radixin like protein), the product of neurofibromatosis type 2 gene, was primarily recognized as a tumor suppressor, but it also functions as a membrane-cytoskeletal linker and regulator of multiple signaling pathways. The activity and localization of merlin is regulated by head to tail folding that is controlled by phosphorylation of the Ser518 side chain. Merlin localizes in the nucleus when the Ser518 side chain is not phosphorylated, while the phosphorylated form is present in the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. In this work interactions and their impact on the subcellular localization and phosphorylation state of the Ser518 side chain of merlin were investigated in endothelial cells. It is shown that merlin (dephospho-Ser518 form) interacts in the nucleus of endothelial cells with the scaffolding protein EBP50, a member of the Na+/H+exchanger regulatory factor family. Upon EBP50 depletion, merlin translocated from the nucleus, suggesting that binding of merlin to EBP50 is critical in the nuclear localization of merlin. Along with the translocation, the phosphorylation level of phospho-Ser518-merlin was increased in EBP50 depleted cells. TIMAP (TGFβ-inhibited membrane-associated protein), a type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) regulatory subunit, was newly recognized as an interacting partner for merlin. Domain mapping using truncated mutant forms in GST pull down revealed that the N-terminal half of TIMAP (aa 1-290) and the FERM domain of merlin are the regions responsible for the interaction.The catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1c) was present in all merlin-TIMAP pull down or immunoprecipitation samples demonstrating that merlin actually interacts with the PP1c-TIMAP holoenzyme. On the other hand, from TIMAP depleted cells, without its targeting protein, PP1c could not bind to merlin. Also, when the phosphatase activity of PP1c-TIMAP was inhibited either with depletion of TIMAP or by treatment of the cells with specific PP1 inhibitor, there was an increase in the amount of phospho-Ser518 form of merlin in the membrane of the cells. These data strongly suggest that the PP1c-TIMAP- complex dephosphorylates phospho-Ser518-merlin. ECIS measurements indicate that phospho-merlin accelerates in vitro wound healing of the endothelial monolayer. In conclusion, in endothelial cells, EBP50 is required for the nuclear localization of merlin and the PP1c-TIMAP holoenzyme plays an important role in the dephosphorylation of merlin on its Ser518 side chain, which influence cell migration and proliferation.

Abstract: Mechanical stress exerts a substantial role on skeletal-cell renewal systems, whereas accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms induce changes and differential gene expression. Although the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, our study suggests that the influence of the long term mechanical stimulation elicits epigenetic modifications controlling osteogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue multipotential stromal cells (hAT-MSCs) and contributes to an accelerating in vitro osteogenesis. GNAS imprinting gene acts as a critical regulator of osteoblast differentiation and is implicated in human genetic disorders with pathological formation of ectopic-skeletal bone. Investigating a wide variety of stimuli, we showed that daily mechanical stretch on hAT-MSCs of 7th and 15th days' intervals induced a significant down-regulation in DNA methylation status of critical CpG sites of NESP and GNASXL isoforms, accompanied by up-regulation of the corresponding gene transcripts, and osteogenic differentiation earlier in culture. Importantly, methylation analysis of differentiating bone marrow-derived MSCs revealed similar methylation patterns. Bioinformatic analysis further showed that all CpG islands exhibiting significant methylation alterations encompassed transcriptional repressor CTCF binding sites. We hereby emphasize the need to investigate the epigenetic alterations on hAT-MSCs during environmental mechanical forces and to consider how the knowledge gained through these studies may foster new means of symptoms prevention and management of ectopic bone formation in the clinic.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is characterized by an accumulation of misfolded proteins, and ER stress reduction is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms that protect cells from ER stress are not completely understood. The present study investigated the role of sestrin 2 (SESN2) on ER stress and sought to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the hepatoprotective effect of SESN2 in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with tunicamycin (Tm) increased SESN2 protein and mRNA levels and reporter gene activity. Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) bound to unfolded protein response elements of SESN2 promoter, transactivated SESN2, and increased SESN2 protein expression. In addition, dominant negative mutant of ATF6α and siRNA against ATF6α blocked the ER stress-mediated SESN2 induction, whereas chemical inhibition of PERK or IRE1 did not affect SESN2 induction by Tm. Ectopic expression of SESN2 in HepG2 cells inhibited CHOP and GRP78 expressions by Tm. Moreover, SESN2 decreased the phosphorylations of JNK and p38 and PARP cleavage, and blocked the cytotoxic effect of excessive ER stress. In a Tm-induced liver injury model, adenoviral delivery of SESN2 in mice decreased serum ALT, AST and LDH activities and the mRNA levels of CHOP and GRP78 in hepatic tissues. Moreover, SESN2 reduced numbers of degenerating hepatocytes, and inhibited caspase 3 and PARP cleavages. These results suggest ATF6 is essential for ER stress-mediated SESN2 induction, and that SESN2 acts as a feedback regulator to protect liver from excess ER stress.

Abstract: Prostate cell metabolism exhibits distinct profiles pre- and post-malignancy. The malignant metabolic shift converts prostate cells from “citrate-producing” to “citrate-oxidizing” cells, thereby enhancing glucose metabolism, a phenotype that contrasts classical tumoral Warburg metabolism. An on-line biosensor chip system (BIONAS 2500) was used to monitor metabolic changes (glycolysis and respiration) in response to the putative anti-cancer nutraceutical 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], in different prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, DU145 and PC3). LNCaP cells exhibited profound metabolic responsiveness to the treatment and thus extensive analysis of metabolism-modulating effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 were performed, including mRNA expression analysis of key metabolic genes (e.g. GLUT1 and PDHK1), analysis of TCA cycle metabolites, glucose uptake/consumption measurements, ATP production, and mitochondrial biogenesis/activity. Altogether, data demonstrate a vivid disruption of glucose metabolism by 1,25(OH)2D3, illustrated by a decreased glucose uptake and an accumulation of citrate/isocitrate due to TCA cycle truncation. Depletion of glycolytic intermediates led to a consistent decrease in TXNIP expression in response to 1,25(OH)2D3, an effect that coincided with the activation of AMPK signaling and a reduction in c-MYC expression. Reduction in TXNIP levels in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 was rescued by an AMPK signaling inhibitor and mimicked by a MYC inhibitor highlighting the possible involvement of both pathways in mediating 1,25(OH)2D3's metabolic effects in PCa cells. Furthermore, pharmacological and genetic modulation of the androgen receptor showed similar and disparate effects on metabolic parameters compared to 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, highlighting the AR-independent nature of 1,25(OH)2D3's metabolism-modulating effects.

Cortical cytoskeleton dynamics regulates plasma membrane calcium ATPase isoform-2 (PMCA2) activity,

Abstract: We have previously shown that purified actin can directly bind to human plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase 4b (hPMCA4b) and exert a dual modulation on its Ca2+-ATPase activity: F-actin inhibits PMCA while short actin oligomers may contribute to PMCA activation. These studies had to be performed with purified proteins given the nature of the biophysical and biochemical approaches used. To assess whether a functional interaction between the PMCAs and the cortical cytoskeleton is of physiological relevance, we characterized this phenomenon in the context of a living cell by monitoring in real-time the changes in the cytosolic calcium levels ([Ca2+]CYT). In this study, we tested the influence of drugs that change the actin and microtubule polymerization state on the activity and membrane expression of the PMCA transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, which allowed us to observe and quantify these relationships in a live cell, for the first time. We found that disrupting the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D significantly increased PMCA-mediated Ca2+ extrusion (~50–100%) whereas pre-treatment with the F-actin stabilizing agent jasplakinolide caused its full inhibition. When the microtubule network was disrupted by pretreatment of the cells with colchicine, we observed a significant decrease in PMCA activity (~40–60% inhibition) in agreement with the previously reported role of acetylated tubulin on the calcium pump. In none of these cases was there a difference in the level of expression of the pump at the cell surface, thus suggesting that the specific activity of the pump was the regulated parameter. Our results indicate that PMCA activity is profoundly affected by the polymerization state of the cortical cytoskeleton in living cells.

Abstract: MID1/TRIM18 is a member of the TRIM family of ubiquitin E3 ligases characterized by the presence of a conserved RING-containing N-terminal tripartite motif. Mutations in the MID1 gene have been associated with the X-linked form of Opitz Syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by midline defects and intellectual disability. The effect of MID1 E3 ligase activity within the cell and the role in the pathogenesis of the disease is still not completely unraveled. Here, we report BRAF35, a non-canonical HMG nuclear factor, as a novel MID1 substrate. MID1 is implicated in BRAF35 ubiquitination promoting atypical poly-ubiquitination via K6-, K27- and K29-linkages. We observed a partial co-localization of the two proteins within cytoplasmic bodies. We found that MID1 depletion alters BRAF35 localization in these structures and increases BRAF35 stability affecting its cytoplasmic abundance. Our data reveal a novel role for MID1 and for atypical ubiquitination in balancing BRAF35 presence, and likely its activity, within nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.

Abstract: Muscle Lim Protein (MLP) is a protein with multiple functional roles in striated muscle physiology and pathophysiology. Herein, we demonstrate that MLP directly binds to slow, fast, and cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) during myogenesis, as shown by yeast two-hybrid and a range of protein-protein interaction assays. The minimal interacting domains involve MLP inter-LIM and MyBP-C [C4]. The interaction is sensitive to cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations changes and to MyBP-C phosphorylation by PKA or CaMKII. Confocal microscopy of differentiating myoblasts showed MLP and MyBP-C colocalization during myoblast differentiation. Suppression of the complex formation with recombinant MyBP-C [C4] peptide overexpression, inhibited myoblast differentiation by 65%. Suppression of both MLP and MyBP-C expression in myoblasts by siRNA revealed negative synergistic effects on differentiation. The MLP/MyBP-C complex modulates the actin activated myosin II ATPase activity in vitro, which could interfere with sarcomerogenesis and myofilaments assembly during differentiation. Our data demonstrate a critical role of the MLP/MyBP-C complex during early myoblast differentiation. Its absence in muscles with mutations or aberrant expression of MLP or MyBP-C could be directly implicated in the development of cardiac and skeletal myopathies.

Abstract: Improving the stability and reliability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is an area of intense research as it is the major barrier in the commercialization of these devices. We study the stability of inverted structured OPV devices in the present work. A large number of these were fabricated and their shelf life times were recorded. P3HT devices show an average T80 (time in which cell efficiency falls to 80% of its initial value) of 34 days. Some of the devices were tested in actual working conditions outdoors in sunlight. A very low T80 value of 12h was observed during the outdoor testing. Thermal degradation study was performed on the devices at 65°C in dark and an average T80 of 200h was obtained. Signatures of trap formation were observed by analysing and comparing the dark current-voltage characteristics of the pristine and degraded devices. The solar cells degrade due to trap formation in the active layer and formation of charge extraction barriers at the contacts.

Abstract: Refractory materials based frequency selective emission/absorption is extremely encouraging for various applications, especially the combustion based thermophotovoltaics (TPV) and solar-TPV systems. The frequency selective emitters/absorbers also face the challenges of robust operation at elevated temperatures. Here, we report titanium nitride based thermal stable emitters/absorbers with good selectivity in the near infrared wavelength range. The titanium nitride nanocavitity array provides high emissivity/absorptivity at the desired short wavelength range but suppressed emissivity/absorptivity at the long wavelength range, and this design could be used to obtain high power density of the TPV system. The cut-off wavelength could be adjusted by encapsulating the cavities with different dielectrics. Meanwhile, the encapsulating layer protects the nanocavity structure from deformation at high temperatures. The thermal stability at 1073 K and 1273 K for two hours in Argon was demonstrated for the encapsulated nanocavity structure.

Abstract: Tight junctions (TJ) between brain endothelial cells are essential for formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Although loss of BBB integrity is associated with several neuropathological disorders, treatments that augment or stabilise the BBB are scarce. Here we show that physiological concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) stimulate the expression of the TJ proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-3 in the brain-derived endothelial cell line bEnd.3 and promote TJ formation between neighbouring cells, demonstrated by augmented transendothelial resistance across cell monolayers. Silencing androgen receptor expression by siRNA does not prevent DHEAS-induced stimulation of ZO-1 expression, indicating that conversion of DHEAS into testosterone is not required for its actions. Suppression of Gnα11 expression by siRNA prevents DHEAS actions, pointing towards a G-protein-coupled receptor as being a mediator of the DHEAS effects. These results are consistent with the idea that DHEAS, acting as a hormone in its own right, supports the integrity of the BBB. The current findings might help in developing new strategies for the prevention or treatment of neurological disorders associated with BBB defects.

Abstract: Metastasis is the major cause of death from lung cancer. Quercetin, a widely distributed bioflavonoid, is well known to induce growth inhibition in a variety of human cancer cells, but how it affects lung cancer cell invasion and metastasis is unclear. Herein, we found that quercetin inhibited the migration/invasion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and bone metastasis in an orthotopic A549 xenograft model by suppressing the Snail-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, survival times of animals were also prolonged after quercetin treatment. Mechanistic investigations found that quercetin suppressed Snail-dependent Akt activation by upregulating maspin and Snail-independent a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 9 expression pathways to modulate the invasive ability of NSCLC cells. In clinical samples, we observed that patients with Snailhigh/p-Akthigh tumors had the shortest survival times. In addition, a lower survival rate was also found in ADAM9high patients than in ADAM9low patients. Overall, our results provide new insights into the role of quercetin-induced molecular regulation in suppressing NSCLC metastasis and suggest that quercetin has potential therapeutic applications for metastatic NSCLC.

Abstract: All-oxide solar cells based on electrodeposited p-type Cu2O absorber and atomic layer deposited n-type ZnMgO are investigated. The introduced solar cell architecture is free of precious metals that are usually employed as electrodes in Cu2O solar cells and is composed almost exclusively of oxide layers. Firstly, a detailed investigation is made on the potentiostatic electrodeposition of the absorber layer on the sputtered, highly conductive and reflective Cr/ITO (ITO: tin-doped indium oxide) electrode. The focus is set on adjusting the deposition parameters to obtain Cu2O layers, which are void-free and with large grains. A multi-textured film is obtained with prominent (111), (200) and (220) reflections. The absorber has a bandgap of 1.93eV and a rough, antireflective surface. Next, the n-type ZnMgO layer has been investigated and a linear relation of the optical bandgap (3.2–3.9eV) versus Mg content was found. The valence band maximum levels have been extracted from X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the band alignment of the Cu2O/ZnMgO was evaluated. Solar cells employing ZnMgO films with ~10at% Mg show best photovoltaic performance, whereas for larger Mg contents a dramatic decrease of the performance takes place, presumably due to excessive, deep-level defects, leading to tunnel recombination. Best cells show short circuit current density of 6.8mA/cm2, open circuit voltage of 550mV, fill factor of 45% and power conversion efficiency of 1.67%.

Abstract: Current models imply that the evolutionarily conserved, actin-binding Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) proteins perform their activities at the plasma membrane by anchoring membrane proteins to the cortical actin network. Here we show that beside its cytoplasmic functions, the single ERM protein of Drosophila, Moesin, has a novel role in the nucleus. The activation of transcription by heat shock or hormonal treatment increases the amount of nuclear Moesin, indicating biological function for the protein in the nucleus. The distribution of Moesin in the nucleus suggests a function in transcription and the depletion of mRNA export factors Nup98 or its interacting partner, Rae1, leads to the nuclear accumulation of Moesin, suggesting that the nuclear function of the protein is linked to mRNA export. Moesin localizes to mRNP particles through the interaction with the mRNA export factor PCID2 and knock down of Moesin leads to the accumulation of mRNA in the nucleus. Based on our results we propose that, beyond its well-known, manifold functions in the cytoplasm, the ERM protein of Drosophila is a new, functional component of the nucleus where it participates in mRNA export.

Abstract: An issue for the community of thin film photovoltaics is understanding of the relationship between impurities in CdS buffer layer and device performance. In addition, the nature and behavior of impurities in CdS is still unclear. This paper attempts to deal with oxygen containing species in solution processed CdS thin films. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and supported by previous crystallographic and electrical conductivity measurements, we propose a mechanism of hydroxide inclusion in CdS thin film deposited from basic water solution. Two XPS emissions characterize the OH groups which seem to be differently included in CdS thin films. OH groups incorporated in CdS lattice are assigned to the line at BE=533.1eV, whereas OH groups assigned to lower BE (531.6eV) are probably located at the grain boundaries. Behavior of the incorporated hydroxide explains well the changes in the crystallographic, optical and electrical properties of solution processed CdS thin films in the process of H2 annealing at temperatures from 250 to 400°C.

Abstract: Differential expression of homomorphous variants of H2A family of histone H2A.1 and H2A.2 have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and maintenance of undifferentiated state of hepatocyte. However, not much is known about the transcriptional regulation of these H2A variants. The current study revealed the presence of 43bp 5′-regulatory region upstream of translation start site and a 26bp 3′ stem loop conserved region for both the H2A.1 and H2A.2 variants. However, alignment of both H2A.1 and H2A.2 5′-untranslated region (UTR) sequences revealed no significant degree of homology between them despite the coding exon being very similar amongst the variants. Further, transient transfection coupled with dual luciferase assay of cloned 5′ upstream sequences of H2A.1 and H2A.2 of length 1.2 (−1056 to +144) and 1.379kb (−1160 to +219) from experimentally identified 5′UTR in rat liver cell line (CL38) confirmed their promoter activity. Moreover, in silico analysis revealed a presence of multiple CpG sites interspersed in the cloned promoter of H2A.1 and a CpG island near TSS for H2A.2, suggesting that histone variants transcription might be regulated epigenetically. Indeed, treatment with DNMT and HDAC inhibitors increased the expression of H2A.2 with no significant change in H2A.1 levels. Further, methyl DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative analysis of DNA methylation using real-time PCR revealed hypo-methylation and hyper-methylation of H2A.1 and H2A.2 respectively in embryonic and HCC compared to control adult liver tissue. Collectively, the data suggests that differential DNA methylation on histone promoters is a dynamic player regulating their expression status in different pathophysiological stages of liver.

Abstract: Cullin 3 (Cul3) belongs to the family of cullins (Cul1–7) providing the scaffold for cullin-RING ubiquitin (Ub) ligases (CRLs), which are activated by neddylation and represent essential E3 ligases of the Ub proteasome system. During adipogenic differentiation neddylated Cul3 accumulates in LiSa-2 preadipocytes. Downregulation of Cul3 and inhibition of neddylation by MLN4924 blocks the formation of lipid droplets (LDs), the lipid storage organelles and markers of adipogenesis. Neddylation of Cul3 coincides with an increase of Rab18, a GTPase associated with LDs. Immunoprecipitation and confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed physical association of Cul3 and Rab18 at the membrane of LDs. RhoA, a suppressor of adipogenesis decreased during differentiation. Our results in LiSa-2 cells, but also mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed a connection between Cul3, Rab18 and RhoA. Downregulation of Cul3 led to a marked increase in RhoA protein expression after 6days of LiSa-2 cell differentiation, suggesting that Cul3 is involved in the regulation of RhoA stability.

Abstract: Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) participates in apoptosis signaling pathway under various pathophysiological conditions. It exerts transcriptional control on the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1, which act on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Previously, we described that NF-κB is negatively regulated by diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ), an enzyme that phosphorylates a lipid second messenger diacylglycerol. DGKζ downregulation enhances inhibitors of NF-κB α (IκBα) degradation and p65 subunit phosphorylation, leading to enhanced NF-κB transcriptional activity. Transcriptional machinery is tightly regulated by assembly/disassembly and modification of nucleosomal components. Of those, the human NAP1-like protein (NAP1L) family functions in the transport, assembly/disassembly of nucleosome core particles. We previously identified NAP1L1 and NAP1L4 as novel DGKζ binding partners, but the mechanism by which NAP1Ls are involved in NF-κB signaling pathway remains unclear. Here we show that knockdown of NAP1L1 suppresses IκBα degradation and nuclear transport of p65 subunit after treatment with TNF-α stimulation, leading to attenuation of the NF-κB transcriptional activity, whereas NAP1L4 knockdown remains silent. Moreover, ChIP assay reveals that NAP1L1 knockdown attenuates p65 binding to the Mcl-1 promoter after TNF-α stimulation. This attenuation leads to reduced expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, thereby decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent apoptosis after treatment with TNF-α and CHX. Collectively, results of this study suggest that NAP1L1 downregulation renders the cell vulnerable to apoptotic cell death through attenuation of NF-κB transcriptional activity on the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 gene.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms underlying abnormal egg production and pregnancy loss is significant for human fertility. SENP7, a SUMO poly-chain editing enzyme, has been regarded as a mitotic regulator of heterochromatin integrity and DNA repair. Herein, we report the roles of SENP7 in mammalian reproductive scenario. Mouse oocytes deficient in SENP7 experienced meiotic arrest at prophase I and metaphase I stages, causing a substantial decrease of mature eggs. Hyperaceylation and hypomethylation of histone H3 and up-regulation of Cdc14B/C accompanied by down-regulation of CyclinB1 and CyclinB2 were further recognized as contributors to defective M-phase entry and spindle assembly in oocytes. The spindle assembly checkpoint activated by defective spindle morphogenesis, which was also caused by mislocalization and ubiquitylation-mediated proteasomal degradation of γ-tubulin, blocked oocytes at meiosis I stage. SENP7-depleted embryos exhibited severely defective maternal-zygotic transition and progressive degeneration, resulting in nearly no blastocyst production. The disrupted epigenetic landscape on histone H3 restricted Rad51C loading onto DNA lesions due to elevated HP1α euchromatic deposition, and reduced DNA 5hmC challenged the permissive status for zygotic DNA repair, which induce embryo death. Our study pinpoints SENP7 as a novel determinant in epigenetic programming and major pathways that govern oocyte and embryo development programs in mammals.

Abstract: Neurons are highly dependent on glucose. A disturbance in glucose homeostasis therefore poses a severe risk that is counteracted by activation of stress responses to limit damage and restore the energy balance. A major stress response that is activated under conditions of glucose deprivation is the unfolded protein response (UPR) that is aimed to restore proteostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum. The key signaling of the UPR involves the transient activation of a transcriptional program and an overall reduction of protein synthesis. Since the UPR is strategically positioned to sense and integrate metabolic stress signals, it is likely that - apart from its adaptive response to restore proteostasis - it also directly affects metabolic pathways. Here we investigate the direct role of the UPR in glucose homeostasis. O-GlcNAc is a post-translational modification that is highly responsive to glucose fluctuations. We find that UPR activation results in decreased O-GlcNAc modification, in line with reduced glucose metabolism. Our data indicate that UPR activation has no direct impact on the upstream processes in glucose metabolism; glucose transporter expression, glucose uptake and hexokinase activity. In contrast, prolonged UPR activation decreases glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism. Decreased mitochondrial respiration is not accompanied by apoptosis or a structural change in mitochondria indicating that the reduction in metabolic rate upon UPR activation is a physiological non-apoptotic response. Metabolic decrease is prevented if the IRE1 pathway of the UPR is inhibited. This indicates that activation of IRE1 signaling induces a reduction in glucose metabolism, as part of an adaptive response.

Abstract: Mixed-phase hydrogenated silicon oxide (SiOx:H) is applied to thin-film hydrogenated amorphous silicon germanium (a-SiGe:H) solar cells serving as both p-doped and n-doped layers. The bandgap of p-SiOx:H is adjusted to achieve a highly-transparent window layer while also providing a strong electric field. Bandgap grading of n-SiOx:H is designed to obtain a smooth transition of the energy band edge from the intrinsic to n-doped layer, without the need of an amorphous buffer layer. With the optimized optical and electrical structure, a high conversion efficiency of 9.41% has been achieved. Having eliminated other doped materials without sacrificing performance, the sole use of SiOx:H in the doped layers of a-SiGe:H cells opens up great flexibility in the design of high-efficiency multi-junction thin-film silicon-based solar cells.

Abstract: In this work, shape–stabilized octadecane and silica microcapsules were prepared by using sol–gel method. In the microcapsules, the octadecane was used as phase change material (PCM) for thermal energy storage, and the silica prepared from methyl triethoxysilane (MTES) acted as shell material to prevent the octadecane from leakage. The thermal properties of the microcapsules were measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The microstructure and particle size of the microcapsules were surveyed by scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT–IR) and X–ray diffractometer (XRD) were used to investigate the chemical structure, crystalloid phase of the microcapsules. The DSC results showed that the satisfactory microencapsulated phase change material (MPCM) sample melts at 28.32°C with a latent heat of 227.66kJ/kg and solidifies at 26.22°C with a latent heat of 226.26kJ/kg. The thermal reliability of the microcapsules was analyzed by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The results indicated that the MPCMs have good thermal stability, which could be used as shape–stabilized phase change materials for thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Alkali solutions are not suitable for texturing multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafer due to the anisotropic etching. In this study, a two-step alkali-etch process is developed to form a flat surface on the wafer, which can be quickly and nearly isotropically etched by immersion in a sodium hydroxide solution, followed by a sodium hydroxide-sodium hypochlorite solution. The etching process leads to the formation of homogenous nanostructure, thereby improving the cell's repeatability and performance by simultaneously increasing its short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage.

Abstract: ZIP9 is a Zn2+ transporter, testosterone receptor, and mediator of signaling events through G-proteins. Despite these pivotal properties, however, its physiological and pathophysiological significance has not yet been comprehensively addressed. Using a cell line that lacks the classical androgen receptor we show that ZIP9-mediated phosphorylation of Erk1/2, CREB, or ATF-1 and expression of claudin-5 and zonula occludens-1 by testosterone can be completely antagonized by bicalutamide (Casodex), an anti-androgen of significant clinical impact. Computational modeling and docking experiments with ZIP9 reveal typical characteristics of ZIP transporters and an extracellular binding site for testosterone capable of accommodating bicalutamide. The presence of this site is verified by our demonstration that the membrane-impermeable testosterone analogue T-BSA-FITC labels the membrane only when ZIP9 is expressed and that this labeling is completely prevented by bicalutamide. The study connects structural features of ZIP9 to its functions and indicates a possible relevance of ZIP9 as a pharmacological target.

Abstract: Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1 (TNF-R1) transmits various intracellular signaling cascades leading to diverse biological outcomes, ranging from proliferation, differentiation, survival to the induction of various forms of cell death (i.e. apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis). These signaling pathways have to be tightly regulated. Proteolysis is an important regulatory mechanism in TNF-R1 pro-apoptotic as well as anti-apoptotic/pro-inflammatory signaling. Some key players in these signaling cascades are known (mainly the caspase-family of proteases and a previously unrecognized “lysosomal death pathway” involving cathepsins), however the interaction of proteases in the regulation of TNF signaling is still enigmatic. Ubiquitination of proteins, both non-degradative degradative, which either results in proteolytic degradation of target substrates or regulates their biological function, represents another layer of regulation in this signaling cascade. We and others found out that the differences in signal quality depend on the localization of the receptors. Plasma membrane resident receptors activate survival signals, while endocytosed receptors can induce cell death. In this article we will review the role of ubiquitination and proteolysis in these diverse events focusing on our own contributions to the lysosomal apoptotic pathway linked to the subcellular compartmentalization of TNF-R1. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteolysis as a Regulatory Event in Pathophysiology edited by Stefan Rose-John.

Abstract: In recent years a wide range of studies have shown that G protein-coupled receptors modulate a variety of cell functions through the formation of dimers. For instance, there is growing evidence for the dimerization of bradykinin or dopamine receptors, both as homodimers and heterodimers. A discovery of direct interactions of angiotensin II receptors with bradykinin 2 receptor (B2R) or dopamine D2 (D2R) receptor has led to a hypothesis on a potential dimerization between two latter receptors. In this study, we have demonstrated a constitutive colocalization of receptors on the membranes of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with plasmid vectors encoding B2R and D2R, fused with fluorescent proteins. The receptor colocalization was significantly enhanced by specific agonists of B2R or D2R after 5min following the addition, whereas simultaneous stimulation with these agonists did not influence the B2R/D2R colocalization level. In addition, B2R-D2R heterodimerization was confirmed with FLIM-FRET technique. The most characteristic signaling pathways for B2R and D2R, dependent on intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP concentration, respectively, were analyzed in cells presenting similar endogenous expression of B2R and D2R. Significant changes in receptors' signaling were observed after simultaneous stimulation with agonists, suggesting transformations in proteins' conformation after dimerization. The evidence of B2R–D2R dimerization may open new perspectives in the modulation of diverse cellular functions which depend on their activation.

Abstract: Dental follicle stem cells (DFSCs) have been considered as promising candidate cells for periodontal tissue regeneration. Understanding the signalling pathways underlying the apoptosis of DFSCs will facilitate its biomedical application. Here we showed that Notch1 signalling could inhibit DFSCs apoptosis because the constitutive overexpression of the intracellular domain of Notch1 (ICN1) promoted proliferation and suppressed apoptosis by inhibiting cytoplasmic mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. The survival-promoting effect of Notch1 was also accomplished by up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad, and blockade of Bax multimerization. Moreover, p-Akt (S473) was significantly increased after ectopic Notch 1 activation. The expression of p53 was also inhibited in Notch1-overexpressing DFSCs, while the ectopic expression of p53 promoted apoptosis even when Notch1 was overexpressed. Meanwhile, all of the opposite phenomena were observed in Notch1 shRNA-silenced DFSCs. Our data strongly suggested that Notch1 signalling inhibited the apoptosis of DFSCs via the cytoplasmic mitochondrial pathway and ICN-Akt signalling pathway, together with nuclear gene expression regulation. These findings would provide molecular cues for the further medical application of DFSCs.

Abstract: Several studies have implicated the downregulation of the tumor suppressor Cyld expression in breast cancer development. However, the mechanisms that regulate Cyld expression in mammary epithelial cells are largely unknown. In order to investigate them, a bioinformatic analysis of the promoter region of Cyld was performed and identified putative nuclear hormone receptor response elements that included peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)-responsive elements. In the present study, we showed that upon activation of the nuclear hormone receptor PPAR-γ by the agonist troglitazone (TZD), there was a significant increase in Cyld mRNA in human mammary epithelial cell lines. The effect of TZD could be attributed to the transactivation of the Cyld promoter as indicated by the upregulation of a luciferase reporter that was driven by the −1995 to +95 region of the human Cyld gene. Furthermore, the upregulation of Cyld expression by TZD was dependent on PPAR-γ since downregulation of PPAR-γ expression by RNAi compromised the induction of Cyld expression by TZD. CYLD induction mediated, at least in part, the TZD-mediated downregulation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced interleukin 8 (IL-8). In addition, downregulation of CYLD compromised the cytotoxic effects of TZD in immortalized mammary epithelial cells. Our results demonstrated that PPAR-γ is a novel regulator of Cyld transcription and identified CYLD as a mediator of the PPAR-γ-dependent anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activity in mammary epithelial cells, which underscores its potential to be used as a target for the development of breast cancer therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: A series of far-red sensitizing squaraine dyes has been systematically designed and synthesized in order to correlate the theoretically calculated values with their corresponding experimental parameters. Efforts have been directed towards determining the minimum thermodynamic energy barrier for the electron injection in the nanoporous TiO2 by logical molecular design. Theoretical calculations using Gaussian program package were performed for ground and excited states in both of the isolated gaseous state as well as in solution including the solvent effect using a self-consistent reaction field polarizable continuum model (PCM). Implementation of the PCM model or use of LSDA functional under TD-DFT calculations gives much better results for energetics as well as absorption maximum for all of the sensitizers used in this work. Newly designed symmetrical squaraine dye SQ-5 exhibits a minimum energy barrier of 0.16eV for electron injection and shows photon harvesting behavior in far-red region with external photoconversion efficiency of 2.02% under simulated solar irradiation.

Abstract: The paradigm of a cytoplasmic methionine cycle synthesizing/eliminating metabolites that are transported into/out of the nucleus as required has been challenged by detection of significant nuclear levels of several enzymes of this pathway. Here, we show betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT), an enzyme that exerts a dual function in maintenance of methionine levels and osmoregulation, as a new component of the nuclear branch of the cycle. In most tissues, low expression of Bhmt coincides with a preferential nuclear localization of the protein. Conversely, the liver, with very high Bhmt expression levels, presents a main cytoplasmic localization. Nuclear BHMT is an active homotetramer in normal liver, although the total enzyme activity in this fraction is markedly lower than in the cytosol. N-terminal basic residues play a role in cytoplasmic retention and the ratio of glutathione species regulates nucleocytoplasmic distribution. The oxidative stress associated with d-galactosamine (Gal) or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) treatments induces BHMT nuclear translocation, an effect that is prevented by administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and glutathione ethyl ester (EGSH), respectively. Unexpectedly, the hepatic nuclear accumulation induced by Gal associates with reduced nuclear BHMT activity and a trend towards increased protein homocysteinylation. Overall, our results support the involvement of BHMT in nuclear homocysteine remethylation, although moonlighting roles unrelated to its enzymatic activity in this compartment cannot be excluded.

Abstract: The human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa induces phosphorylation of the adaptor protein CrkII by activating the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl to promote its uptake into host cells. So far, specific factors of P. aeruginosa, which induce Abl/CrkII signalling, are entirely unknown. In this research, we employed human lung epithelial cells H1299, Chinese hamster ovary cells and P. aeruginosa wild type strain PAO1 to study the invasion process of P. aeruginosa into host cells by using microbiological, biochemical and cell biological approaches such as Western Blot, immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Here, we demonstrate that the host glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide, also termed Gb3, represents a signalling receptor for the P. aeruginosa lectin LecA to induce CrkII phosphorylation at tyrosine 221. Alterations in Gb3 expression and LecA function correlate with CrkII phosphorylation. Interestingly, phosphorylation of CrkIIY221 occurs independently of Abl kinase. We further show that Src family kinases transduce the signal induced by LecA binding to Gb3, leading to CrkY221 phosphorylation. In summary, we identified LecA as a bacterial factor, which utilizes a so far unrecognized mechanism for phospho-CrkIIY221 induction by binding to the host glycosphingolipid receptor Gb3. The LecA/Gb3 interaction highlights the potential of glycolipids to mediate signalling processes across the plasma membrane and should be further elucidated to gain deeper insights into this non-canonical mechanism of activating host cell processes.

Abstract: In this project we examined how the presence of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) modifies (supports or inhibits) colorectal and pancreatic cancer cell progression in mice peritoneal cavity. Experiments were performed using primary, omentum-derived HPMCs, commercially available colorectal (SW-480) and pancreatic (PSN-1) cancer cells, and immunocompromised SCID mice. Tumor growth within the peritoneal cavity was monitored using bioluminescence. Adhesion of the cancer cells to HPMCs was examined using a fluorescence-based method, while the incidence of apoptosis was quantified using flow cytometry. Experiments showed that SW480 and PSN-1 cells formed tumors in vivo at higher efficiency when they were injected alone than in the presence of HPMCs. In vitro investigations confirmed that firm adhesion of SW480 and PSN-1 cells to HPMCs is mediated by interactions between ICAM-1 and CD43. They also revealed that IL-6 and TNFα up-regulate the expression of cell-bound ICAM-1 and the secretion of soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1). The basal release of sICAM-1 by HPMCs positively correlated with the expression of the cell-bound molecule. sICAM-1 inhibited dose-dependently the adhesion of SW480 and PSN-1 cells to HPMCs. Cancer cells that did not adhere to HPMCs displayed increased activity of caspase-3 and -9, increased incidence of apoptosis, and an inability to re-adhesion, as compared with their intact counterparts not exposed to sICAM-1. Our findings indicate that under certain conditions HPMCs are capable of inhibiting growth of gastrointestinal tumors in a mechanism involving the anti-adhesive capabilities of sICAM-1.

Abstract: Survival motor neuron (SMN) is a 38-kDa protein, whose deficiency in humans develops spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease with muscular atrophy due to motor neuron death in the spinal cord. We now report that SMN prevents the activation of TRAF6 and IκB kinase (IKK) and thereby negatively regulates the NF-κB signaling processes. SMN physically interacted with TRAF6 and with each component of the IKK complex, IKK-α, IKK-β, and IKK-γ in BV2 microglia cells. Moreover, SMN1 inhibited the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6 as well as the kinase activity of IKK. Furthermore, depletion of endogenous SMN by RNA interference enhanced the IL-1β-induced activation of IKK and production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and nitric oxide in BV2 cells. Consistently, the potentiation of IL-1β-induced IKK activity was also found in SMA patient fibroblasts, compared with that of normal ones. Our results thus suggest that SMN functions as a natural inhibitor for IL-1β-induced NF-κB signaling by targeting TRAF6 and the IKK complex.

Abstract: Transparent coatings with different hydrophobicity have been prepared by a cost-efficient and simple approach. These coatings possess two main properties: high transmittance and anti-soiling effect. Four experiments are designed to simulate the surface-dust interactions, one of which is a dust impinging experiment and the other three are dust removal experiments. A high-speed camera is used to capture the impinging and depositing process of dust driven by air stream. Different moving behaviors of dust particles can be observed on the bare and coated glass surfaces, which can be used to illustrate the different soiling phenomena. The anti-soiling effects of coated surfaces are reflected in two kinds of experiments. The first is the dust impinging experiments and the second is the dust removal experiments. It is found that the low surface energy and rough structures of coatings work together to lower the adhesion forces between the particles and surfaces. This anti-dust effect almost has no relations with the strength of hydrophobicity: both superhydrophobic surface and ordinary hydrophobic surface have anti-dust effect.

Abstract: 4-pirydone-3-carboxamide-1β-d-ribonucleoside (4PYR) is an endogenous nucleoside that could be converted to triphosphates, diphosphates, monophosphates and an analogue of NAD − 4PYRAD. Elevated level of these compounds have been reported in chronic renal failure, cancer and active HIV infection. However, little is known about the effect on cell functionality and the metabolic pathways. This study tested effects of 4PYR in different cell types on nucleotide, energy metabolism and clarified enzymes that are involved in conversions of 4PYR. We have found that human neuroblastoma cells, human malignant melanoma cells, human adipose-derived stem cells, human bone marrow-derived stem cells, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and human embryonic kidney cells, were capable to convert 4PYR into its derivatives. This was associated with deterioration of cellular energetics. Incubation with 4PYR did not affect mitochondrial function, but decreased glycolytic rate (as measured by extracellular acidification) in endothelial cells. Silencing of adenosine kinase, cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II and nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 3, blocked metabolism of 4PYR. Incubation of endothelial cells with 4PYR decreased AMP deaminase activity by 40%. The main finding of this paper is that human cells (including cancer type) are capable of metabolizing 4PYR that lead to deterioration of energy metabolism, possibly as the consequence of inhibition of glycolysis. This study, it was also found that several enzymes of nucleotide metabolism could also contribute to the 4PYRconversions

Abstract: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a multi-domain protein, is a key causative factor in Parkinson's disease (PD). Identification of novel substrates and the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of LRRK2 are essential for understanding the pathogenesis of PD. In this study, we showed that LRRK2 played an important role in neuronal cell death by directly phosphorylating and activating apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). LRRK2 phosphorylated ASK1 at Thr832 that is adjacent to Thr845, which serves as an autophosphorylation site. Moreover, results of binding and kinase assays showed that LRRK2 acted as a scaffolding protein by interacting with each components of the ASK1–MKK3/6–p38 MAPK pathway through its specific domains and increasing the proximity to downstream targets. Furthermore, LRRK2-induced apoptosis was suppressed by ASK1 inhibition in neuronal stem cells derived from patients with PD. These results clearly indicate that LRRK2 acts as an upstream kinase in the ASK1 pathway and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PD.

Cold-sensing TRPM8 channel participates in circadian control of the brown adipose tissue,

Abstract: Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are known to regulate energy metabolism, and TRPM8 has become an interesting player in this context. Here we demonstrate the role of the cold sensor TRPM8 in the regulation of clock gene and clock controlled genes in brown adipose tissue (BAT). We investigated TrpM8 temporal profile in the eyes, suprachiasmatic nucleus and BAT; only BAT showed temporal variation of TrpM8 transcripts. Eyes from mice lacking TRPM8 lost the temporal profile of Per1 in LD cycle. This alteration in the ocular circadian physiology may explain the delay in the onset of locomotor activity in response to light pulse, as compared to wild type animals (WT). Brown adipocytes from TrpM8 KO mice exhibited a larger multilocularity in comparison to WT or TrpV1 KO mice. In addition, Ucp1 and UCP1 expression was significantly reduced in TrpM8 KO mice in comparison to WT mice. Regarding circadian components, the expression of Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Pparα, and Pparβ oscillated in WT mice kept in LD, whereas in the absence of TRPM8 the expression of clock genes was reduced in amplitude and lack temporal oscillation. Thus, our results reveal new roles for TRPM8 channel: it participates in the regulation of clock and clock-controlled genes in the eyes and BAT, and in BAT thermogenesis. Since disruption of the clock machinery has been associated with many metabolic disorders, the pharmacological modulation of TRPM8 channel may become a promising therapeutic target to counterbalance weight gain, through increased thermogenesis, energy expenditure, and clock gene activation.
