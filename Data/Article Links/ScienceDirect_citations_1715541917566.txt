Abstract: Summary
Several recent studies describe the influence of the gut microbiota on host brain and behavior. However, the mechanisms responsible for microbiota-nervous system interactions are largely unknown. Using a combination of genetics, biochemistry, and crystallography, we identify and characterize two phylogenetically distinct enzymes found in the human microbiome that decarboxylate tryptophan to form the β-arylamine neurotransmitter tryptamine. Although this enzymatic activity is exceedingly rare among bacteria more broadly, analysis of the Human Microbiome Project data demonstrate that at least 10% of the human population harbors at least one bacterium encoding a tryptophan decarboxylase in their gut community. Our results uncover a previously unrecognized enzymatic activity that can give rise to host-modulatory compounds and suggests a potential direct mechanism by which gut microbiota can influence host physiology, including behavior.

Abstract: The small intestine consists of two histological compartments composed of the crypts and the villi. The function of the adult small intestinal epithelium is mediated by four different types of mature cells: enterocytes, goblet, enteroendocrine and Paneth. Undifferentiated cells reside in the crypts and produce these four types of mature cells. The niche-related Wnt and Bmp signaling pathways have been suggested to be involved in the regulation and maintenance of the stem cell microenvironment. In our laboratory, we isolated the first normal human intestinal epithelial crypt (HIEC) cell model from the human fetal intestine and in this study we investigated the expression of a panel of intestinal stem cell markers in HIEC cells under normal culture parameters as well as under conditions that mimic the stem cell microenvironment. The results showed that short term stimulation of HIEC cells with R-spondin 1 and Wnt-3a±SB-216763, a glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) inhibitor, induced β-catenin/TCF activity and expression of the WNT target genes, cyclin D2 and LGR5. Treatment of HIEC cells with noggin, an antagonist of BMP signaling, abolished SMAD2/5/8 phosphorylation. Inducing a switch from inactive WNT/active BMP toward active WNT/inactive BMP pathways was sufficient to trigger a robust intestinal primordial stem-like cell signature with predominant LGR5, PHLDA1, PROM1, SMOC2 and OLFM4 expression. These findings demonstrate that even fully established cultures of intestinal cells can be prompted toward a CBC stem cell-like phenotype. This model should be useful for studying the regulation of human intestinal stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.

Abstract: As a super-antigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2) stimulates the release of massive inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) which are documented to implicate osteoblast differentiation. In the present study, SEC2 was found to significantly improve the osteoblast differentiation by up-regulating BMP2 and Runx2/Cbfa1 expression. Interferon (IFN)-inducible gene IFI16, a co-activator of Runx2/Cbfa1, was also activated by SEC2 in the osteoblast differentiation. In addition, exogenous introduction of SEC2 stimulated OPG expression and suppressed RANKL, suggesting suppression of osteoclastogenesis in hMSCs. Therefore, our results displayed that SEC2 plays an important role in the commitment of MSC to the osteoblast and it might be a potential new therapeutic candidate for bone regeneration.

Abstract: This work examines the potential drug delivery barrier of the basement membrane (BM) by assessing the permeability of select macromolecules and nanoparticles. The study further extends to probing the effect of BM on intestinal epithelial cell attachment and monolayer characteristics, including cell morphology. Serum-free cultured Caco-2 cells were grown on BM-containing porous supports, which were obtained by prior culture of airway epithelial cells (Calu-3), shown to assemble and deposit a BM on the growth substrate, followed by decellularisation. Data overall show that the attachment capacity of Caco-2 cells, which is completely lost in serum-free culture, is fully restored when the cells are grown on BM-coated substrates, with cells forming intact monolayers with high electrical resistance and low permeability to macromolecules. Caco-2 cells cultured on BM-coated substrates displayed strikingly different morphological characteristics, suggestive of a higher level of differentiation and closer resemblance to the native intestinal epithelium. BM was found to notably hinder the diffusion of macromolecules and nanoparticles in a size dependent manner. This suggests that the specialised network of extracellular matrix proteins may have a significant impact on transmucosal delivery of certain therapeutics or drug delivery systems.

Abstract: Summary
Distinct integration patterns of different retroviruses, including HIV-1, have puzzled virologists for over 20 years. A tetramer of the viral integrase (IN) assembles on the two viral cDNA ends, docks onto the target DNA (tDNA), and catalyzes viral genome insertion into the host chromatin. We identified the amino acids in HIV-1 IN that directly contact tDNA bases and affect local integration site sequence selection. These residues also determine the propensity of the virus to integrate into flexible tDNA sequences. Remarkably, natural polymorphisms INS119G and INR231G retarget viral integration away from gene-dense regions. Precisely these variants were associated with rapid disease progression in a chronic HIV-1 subtype C infection cohort. These findings link integration site selection to virulence and viral evolution, but also to the host immune response and antiretroviral therapy, since HIV-1 IN119 is under selection by HLA alleles and integrase inhibitors.

Abstract: JMJD2A is a lysine trimethyl-specific histone demethylase that is highly expressed in a variety of tumours. The role of JMJD2A in tumour progression remains unclear. The objectives of this study were to identify JMJD2A-regulated genes and understand the function of JMJD2A in p53-null neuroectodermal stem cells (p53−/− NE-4Cs). We determined the effect of LPS as a model of inflammation in p53−/− NE-4Cs and investigated whether the epigenetic modifier JMJD2A alter the expression of tumourigenic inflammatory genes. Global gene expression was measured in JMJD2A knockdown (kd) p53−/− NE-4Cs and in LPS-stimulated JMJD2A-kd p53−/− NE-4C cells. JMJD2A attenuation significantly down-regulated genes were Cdca2, Ccnd2, Ccnd1, Crebbp, IL6rα, and Stat3 related with cell cycle, proliferation, and inflammatory-disease responses. Importantly, some tumour-suppressor genes including Dapk3, Timp2 and TFPI were significantly up-regulated but were not affected by silencing of the JMJD2B. Furthermore, we confirmed the attenuation of JMJD2A also down-regulated Cdca2, Ccnd2, Crebbp, and Rest in primary NSCs isolated from the forebrains of E15 embryos of C57/BL6J mice with effective p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α (PFT-α). Transcription factor (TF) motif analysis revealed known binding patterns for CDC5, MYC, and CREB, as well as three novel motifs in JMJD2A-regulated genes. IPA established molecular networks. The molecular network signatures and functional gene-expression profiling data from this study warrants further investigation as an effective therapeutic target, and studies to elucidate the molecular mechanism of JMJD2A-kd-dependent effects in neuroectodermal stem cells should be performed.

Abstract: MiR-17-92 cluster has recently been reported as an oncogene in some tumors. However, the association of miR-18a, an important member of this cluster, with glioblastoma remains unknown. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the expression of miR-18a in glioblastoma and its role in biological behavior of U87 and U251 human glioblastoma cell lines. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that miR-18a was highly expressed in glioblastoma tissues and U87 and U251 cell lines compared with that in human brain tissues and primary normal human astrocytes, and the expression levels were increased along with the rising pathological grades of glioblastoma. Neogenin was identified as the target gene of miR-18a by dual-luciferase reporter assays. RT-PCR and western blot results showed that its expression levels were decreased along with the rising pathological grades of glioblastoma. Inhibition of miR-18a expression was established by transfecting exogenous miR-18a inhibitor into U87 and U251 cells, and its effects on the biological behavior of glioblastoma cells were studied using CCK-8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry. Inhibition of miR-18a expression in U87 and U251 cells significantly up-regulated neogenin, and dramatically suppressed the abilities of cell proliferation, migration and invasion, induced cell cycle arrest and promoted cellular apoptosis. Collectively, these results suggest that miR-18a may regulate biological behavior of human glioblastoma cells by targeting neogenin, and miR-18a can serve as a potential target in the treatment of glioblastoma.

Abstract: Bcl-2 family proteins act as essential regulators and mediators of intrinsic apoptosis. Several lines of evidence suggest that the anti-apoptotic members of the family, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, exhibit functional redundancy. However, the current evidence is largely indirect, and based mainly on pharmacological data using small-molecule inhibitors. In order to study compensation and redundancy of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins at the molecular level, we used a combined knockdown/overexpression strategy to essentially replace the function of one member with another. The results show that HeLa cells are strictly dependent on Mcl-1 for survival and correspondingly refractory to the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-263, and remain resistant to ABT-263 in the context of Bcl-xL overexpression because endogenous Mcl-1 continues to provide the primary guardian role. However, if Mcl-1 is knocked down in the context of Bcl-xL overexpression, the cells become Bcl-xL-dependent and sensitive to ABT-263. We also show that Bcl-xL compensates for loss of Mcl-1 by sequestration of two key pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bak and Bim, normally bound to Mcl-1, and that Bim is essential for cell death induced by Mcl-1 knockdown. To our knowledge, this is the first example where cell death induced by loss of Mcl-1 was rescued by the silencing of a single BH3-only Bcl-2 family member. In colon carcinoma cell lines, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 also play compensatory roles, and Mcl-1 knockdown sensitizes cells to ABT-263. The results, obtained employing a novel strategy of combining knockdown and overexpression, provide unique molecular insight into the mechanisms of compensation by pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling factors including retinoic acid (RA) and thyroid hormone (T3) promote neuronal, oligodendrocyte, and astrocyte differentiation of cortical neural stem cells (NSCs). However, the functional specificity of transcriptional repressor checkpoints controlling these differentiation programs remains unclear. Here, we show by genome-wide analysis that histone deacetylase (HDAC)2 and HDAC3 show overlapping and distinct promoter occupancy at neuronal and oligodendrocyte-related genes in NSCs. The absence of HDAC3, but not HDAC2, initiated a neuronal differentiation pathway in NSCs. The ablation of the corepressor NCOR or HDAC2, in conjunction with T3 treatment, resulted in increased expression of oligodendrocyte genes, revealing a direct HDAC2-mediated repression of Sox8 and Sox10 expression. Interestingly, Sox10 was required also for maintaining the more differentiated state by repression of stem cell programming factors such as Sox2 and Sox9. Distinct and nonredundant actions of NCORs and HDACs are thus critical for control of lineage progression and differentiation programs in neural progenitors.

Abstract: Mammalian ghrelin is derived from stomach and regulates growth hormone release and appetite by modulating GHS-R (Growth hormone secretagogue receptor) activity. Zebrafish has been developed as a forward genetic screening model system and previous screening identified a number of genes involved in multiple signaling pathways. In this system, ghrelin has been identified and its function and regulation have been shown to be highly conserved to that of mammals. Here, we identified three isoforms of zGHS-R1 and one of zGHS-R2 (zGHS-R2a), and characterized their expression, regulation and function. Three isoforms of zGHS-R1, which we named zGHS-R1a, zGHS-R1b, and zGHS-R1c, are generated by alternative splicing. The expression of zGHS-R1 is highly enriched in brain, intestine tissue, and skin tissues. Compared to zGHS-R1, the expression pattern of zGHS-R2a is rather evenly distributed. A 15 day fasting elevated expression of zGHS-R1 and zGHS-R2 transcripts in anterior intestine tissues, but not in brain. Whereas zGHS-R1a, zGHS-R1c, and zGHS-R2a appear to be presented on the plasma membrane, the localization of zGHS-R1b seems to be restricted in the intracellular region. Treatment of ghrelin agonist, L692,585 or goldfish ghrelin peptides but not rat ghrelin, elevated intracellular Ca2+ level and phosphorylation of ERK in HEK-293 cells expressing zGHS-R1a, but not zGHS-R1b, zGHS-R1c, or zGHS-R2a. It appears that besides core ghrelin peptide sequence of GS/TSF additional amino acids are required for the activation of zGHS-R1a, as rat ghrelin induces neither intracellular Ca2+ mobilization nor ERK phosphrylation. These results suggest that ghrelin system in zebrafish is highly conserved to that of mammals, and thus is an ideal in vivo model for dissecting ghrelin system.

Abstract: Post-translational regulation plays a critical role in the control of cell growth and proliferation. The phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is the most important post-translational modification. The function of PPARγ phosphorylation has been studied extensively in the past. However, the relationship between phosphorylated PPARγ1 and tumors remains unclear. Here we investigated the role of PPARγ1 phosphorylation in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line. Using the nonphosphorylation (Ser84 to alanine, S84A) and phosphorylation (Ser84 to aspartic acid, S84D) mutant of PPARγ1, the results suggested that phosphorylation attenuated PPARγ1 transcriptional activity. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that phosphorylated PPARγ1 promoted HT1080 cell proliferation and this effect was dependent on the regulation of cell cycle arrest. The mRNA levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 descended in PPARγ1S84D stable HT1080 cell, whereas the expression of p18INK4C was not changed. Moreover, compared to the PPARγ1S84A, PPARγ1S84D up-regulated the expression levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin A. Finally, PPARγ1 phosphorylation reduced sensitivity to agonist rosiglitazone and increased resistance to anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in HT1080 cell. Our findings establish PPARγ1 phosphorylation as a critical event in human fibrosarcoma growth. These findings raise the possibility that chemical compounds that prevent the phosphorylation of PPARγ1 could act as anticancer drugs.

Abstract: Since over 60% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor positive (ER+), many therapies have targeted the ER. The ER is activated by both estrogen binding and phosphorylation. While anti-estrogen therapies, such as tamoxifen (Tam) have been successful they do not target the growth factor promoting phosphorylation of the ER. Other proliferation pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, (PI3K) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are activated in breast cancer cells and are associated with poor prognosis. Thus targeting multiple cellular proliferation and survival pathways at the onset of treatment is critical for the development of more effective therapies. The grapefruit flavanone naringenin (Nar) is an inhibitor of both the PI3K and MAPK pathways. Previous studies examining either Nar or Tam used charcoal-stripped serum which removed estrogen as well as other factors. We wanted to use serum containing medium in order to retain all the potential inducers of cell proliferation so as not to exclude any targets of Nar. Here we show that a Nar–Tam combination is more effective than either Tam alone or Nar alone in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that a Nar–Tam combination impaired cellular proliferation and viability to a greater extent than either component alone in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the use of a Nar–Tam combination requires lower concentrations of both compounds to achieve the same effects on proliferation and viability. Nar may function by inhibiting both PI3K and MAPK pathways as well as localizing ERα to the cytoplasm in MCF-7 cells. Our results demonstrate that a Nar–Tam combination induces apoptosis and impairs proliferation signaling to a greater extent than either compound alone. These studies provide critical information for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis in breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr enhances infection of primary macrophages through unknown mechanisms. Recent studies demonstrated that Vpr interactions with the cellular DCAF1-DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex limit activation of innate immunity and interferon (IFN) induction. We describe a restriction mechanism that targets the HIV-1 envelope protein Env, but is overcome by Vpr and its interaction with DCAF1. This restriction is active in the absence of Vpr in HIV-1-infected primary macrophages and macrophage-epithelial cell heterokaryons, but not epithelial cell lines. HIV-1-infected macrophages lacking Vpr express more IFN following infection, target Env for lysosomal degradation, and produce fewer Env-containing virions. Conversely, Vpr expression reduces IFN induction, rescues Env expression, and enhances virion release. Addition of IFN or silencing DCAF1 reduces the amount of cell-associated Env and virion production in wild-type HIV-1-infected primary macrophages. These findings provide insight into an IFN-stimulated macrophage-specific restriction pathway targeting HIV-1 Env that is counteracted by Vpr.

Abstract: While cellular LC3B and SQSTM1 levels serve as key autophagy markers, their regulation by different signaling pathways requires better understanding. Here, we report the mechanisms by which the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway regulates cellular LC3B and SQSTM1 levels. In different cell types, ΔRaf-1:ER- or B-RafV600E-mediated MEK/ERK activation increased LC3B-I, LC3B-II, and SQSTM1/p62 levels, which was accompanied by increased BiP/GRP78 expression. Use of the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine and bafilomycin A1, or RNA interference of ATG7, suggested that these increases in LC3B and SQSTM1 levels were in part attributed to altered autophagic flux. However, intriguingly, these increases were also attributed to their increased expression. Upon Raf/MEK/ERK activation, mRNA levels of LC3B and SQSTM1 were also increased, and subsequent luciferase reporter analyses suggested that SQSTM1 upregulation was mediated at transcription level. Under this condition, transcription of BiP/GRP78 was also increased, which was necessary for Raf/MEK/ERK to regulate LC3B at the protein, but not mRNA, level. This suggests that BiP has a role in regulating autophagy machinery when Raf/MEK/ERK is activated. In conclusion, these results suggest that, under a Raf/MEK/ERK-activated condition, the steady-state cellular levels of LC3B and SQSTM1 can also be determined by their altered expression wherein BiP is utilized as an effector of the signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Detailed knowledge of cell-surface proteins for isolating well-defined populations of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) would significantly enhance their characterization and translational potential. Through a chemoproteomic approach, we developed a cell-surface proteome inventory containing 496 N-linked glycoproteins on human embryonic (hESCs) and induced PSCs (hiPSCs). Against a backdrop of human fibroblasts and 50 other cell types, >100 surface proteins of interest for hPSCs were revealed. The >30 positive and negative markers verified here by orthogonal approaches provide experimental justification for the rational selection of pluripotency and lineage markers, epitopes for cell isolation, and reagents for the characterization of putative hiPSC lines. Comparative differences between the chemoproteomic-defined surfaceome and the transcriptome-predicted surfaceome directly led to the discovery that STF-31, a reported GLUT-1 inhibitor, is toxic to hPSCs and efficient for selective elimination of hPSCs from mixed cultures.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated whether gastric cancer with hypoxia-induced resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) could be re-sensitized following treatment with low-dose dichloroacetate (DCA), an inhibitor of the glycolytic pathway. The expression profiles of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1) were analyzed in tissues from 10 patients with gastric cancer who had different responses to adjuvant 5-FU treatment. For the in vitro assays, cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated with and without treatment with 20mM DCA in the AGS and MKN45 cell lines, as well as in PDK1 knockdown cell lines. The expression levels of HIF-1α and PDK-1 were both elevated in the tumor tissues relative to the normal gastric tissues of most patients who showed recurrence after adjuvant 5-FU treatment. Cellular viability tests showed that these cell lines had a lower sensitivity to 5-FU under hypoxic conditions compared to normoxic conditions. Moreover, the addition of 20mM DCA only increased the sensitivity of these cells to 5-FU under hypoxic conditions, and the resistance to 5-FU under hypoxia was also attenuated in PDK1 knockdown cell lines. In conclusion, DCA treatment was able to re-sensitize gastric cancer cells with hypoxia-induced resistance to 5-FU through the alteration of glucose metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Throughout their journey to forming new individuals, germline stem cells must remain totipotent, particularly by maintaining a specific chromatin structure. However, the place epigenetic factors occupy in this process remains elusive. So far, “sensitization” of chromatin by modulation of histone arrangement and/or content was believed to facilitate transcription-factor-induced germ cell reprogramming. Here, we demonstrate that the combined reduction of two epigenetic factors suffices to reprogram C. elegans germ cells. The histone H3K4 demethylase SPR-5/LSD1 and the chromatin remodeler LET-418/Mi2 function together in an early process to maintain germ cell status and act as a barrier to block precocious differentiation. This epigenetic barrier is capable of limiting COMPASS-mediated H3K4 methylation, because elevated H3K4me3 levels correlate with germ cell reprogramming in spr-5; let-418 mutants. Interestingly, germ cells deficient for spr-5 and let-418 mainly reprogram as neurons, suggesting that neuronal fate might be the first to be derepressed in early embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of glutamine residues in the N-terminal region of the huntingtin (HTT) protein. The disease results in progressive neuronal loss, leading to motor, cognitive, and psychiatric impairment. Here, we report the establishment of neural progenitor cell (NPC) lines derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of transgenic HD monkeys. Upon differentiation to neurons, HD neural cells develop cellular features of HD, including the formation of nuclear inclusions and oligomeric mutant HTT (mHTT) aggregates, as well as increased apoptosis. These phenotypes are rescued by genetic suppression of HTT and pharmacological treatment, demonstrating the ability of our HD cell model to respond to therapeutic treatment. The development and reversal of HD-associated phenotypes in neural cells from HD monkeys provides a unique nonhuman primate (NHP) model for exploring HD pathogenesis and evaluating therapeutics that could be assessed further in HD monkeys.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. We have previously observed amyloid production in the retina of the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, we used tunicamycin-induced ER stress in RGC-5 cells, a cell line identical to the photoreceptor cell line 661W, to investigate the effect of ER stress on production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. We found that the mRNA level of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) remained stable, while the protein level of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) was decreased, the amyloid-beta precursor protein cleaving enzymes beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 and presenilin 1 were upregulated, Abeta1–40 and Abeta1–42 production were increased, and reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis markers were elevated following induction of ER stress. The protein level of Abeta degradation enzymes, neprilysin, endothelin-converting enzyme 1, and endothelin-converting enzyme 2 remained unchanged during the prolonged ER stress, showing that the generation of Abeta did not result from reduction of proteolysis by these enzymes. Inclusion of group II caspase inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK, increased the ER stress mediated Abeta production, suggesting that they are generated by a caspase-independent mechanism. Our findings provided evidence of a role of ER stress in Abeta peptide overproduction and apoptotic pathway activation in RGC-5 cells.

Abstract: Summary
Central to cellular proliferative, survival, and metabolic responses is the serine/threonine kinase mTOR, which is activated in many human cancers. mTOR is present in distinct complexes that are either modulated by AKT (mTORC1) or are upstream and regulatory of it (mTORC2). Governance of mTORC2 activity is poorly understood. Here, we report a transmembrane molecule in hematopoietic progenitor cells that physically interacts with and inhibits RICTOR, an essential component of mTORC2. Upstream of mTORC2 (UT2) negatively regulates mTORC2 enzymatic activity, reducing AKTS473, PKCα, and NDRG1 phosphorylation and increasing FOXO transcriptional activity in an mTORC2-dependent manner. Modulating UT2 levels altered animal survival in a T cell acute lymphoid leukemia (T-ALL) model that is known to be mTORC2 sensitive. These studies identify an inhibitory component upstream of mTORC2 in hematopoietic cells that can reduce mortality from NOTCH-induced T-ALL. A transmembrane inhibitor of mTORC2 may provide an attractive target to affect this critical cell regulatory pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a conserved eukaryotic RNA surveillance mechanism that degrades aberrant mRNAs. NMD impairment in Arabidopsis is linked to constitutive immune response activation and enhanced antibacterial resistance, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that NMD contributes to innate immunity in Arabidopsis by controlling the turnover of numerous TIR domain-containing, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (TNL) immune receptor-encoding mRNAs. Autoimmunity resulting from NMD impairment depends on TNL signaling pathway components and can be triggered through deregulation of a single TNL gene, RPS6. Bacterial infection of plants causes host-programmed inhibition of NMD, leading to stabilization of NMD-regulated TNL transcripts. Conversely, constitutive NMD activity prevents TNL stabilization and impairs plant defense, demonstrating that host-regulated NMD contributes to disease resistance. Thus, NMD shapes plant innate immunity by controlling the threshold for activation of TNL resistance pathways.

Abstract: Diabetes is caused by loss or dysfunction of pancreatic beta cells. Generation of beta cells in vitro is a promising strategy to develop a full-scale cell therapy against diabetes, and the development of methods without gene transfer may provide safer protocols for human therapy. Here we show that thyroid hormone receptors are expressed in embryonic murine pancreas. Addition of the thyroid hormone T3 in an ex vivo culture model of embryonic (E12.5) dorsal pancreas, mimicking embryonic pancreatic development, promoted an increase of ductal cell number at expenses of the acinar compartment. Double labeled cells expressing specific markers for ductal and acinar cells were observed, suggesting cell reprogramming. Increased mRNA levels of the pro-endocrine gene Ngn3 and an increased number of beta cells were detected in cultures treated previously with T3 suggesting that ductal cells promoted by T3 can subsequently differentiate into endocrine cells. So, indirectly, T3 induced endocrine differentiation. Moreover, T3 induced the expression of the pro-endocrine gene Ngn3 in the acinar 266-6 cell line. The pro-endocrine effect of T3 in the pancreatic explants and in the acinar cell line, was abrogated by the Akt inhibitor Ly294002 indicating the involvement of Akt signaling in this process. Altogether we show numerous evidences that define T3 as a promising candidate to generate endocrine cells from exocrine tissue, using ectopically gene expression free protocols, for cell therapy against diabetes.

Abstract: Exposure of Normal Human Osteoblast cells (NHOst) to a period of hypothermia may interrupt their cellular functions, lead to changes in bone matrix and disrupt the balance between bone formation and resorption, resulting in bone loss or delayed fracture healing. To investigate this possibility, we exposed NHOst cells to moderate (35°C) and severe (27°C) hypothermia for 1, 12, 24 and 72h. The effects of hypothermia with respect to cell cytoskeleton organization, metabolic activity and the expression of cold shock chaperone proteins, osteoblast transcription factors and functional markers, were examined. Our findings showed that prolonged moderate hypothermia retained the polymerization of the cytoskeletal components. NHOst cell metabolism was affected differently according to hypothermia severity. The osteoblast transcription factors Runx2 and osterix were necessary for the transcription and translation of bone matrix proteins, where alkaline phosphatase (Alp) activity and osteocalcin (OCN) bone protein were over expressed under hypothermic conditions. Consequently, bone mineralization was stimulated after exposure to moderate hypothermia for 1 week, indicating bone function was not impaired. The cold shock chaperone protein Rbm3 was significantly upregulated (p<0.001) during the cellular stress adaption under hypothermic conditions. We suggest that Rbm3 has a dual function: one as a chaperone protein that stabilizes mRNA transcripts and a second one in enhancing the transcription of Alp and Ocn genes. Our studies demonstrated that hypothermia permitted the in vitro maturation of NHOst cells probably through an osterix-dependent pathway. For that reason, we suggest that moderate hypothermia can be clinically applied to counteract heat production at the fracture site that delays fracture healing.

Abstract: Clinical evidence indicates increased amyloid deposition in HIV-1-infected brains, which contributes to neurocognitive dysfunction in infected patients. Here we show that HIV-1 exposure stimulates amyloid beta (Aβ) nuclear entry in human brain endothelial cells (HBMEC), the main component of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Treatment with HIV-1 and/or Aβ resulted in concurrent increase in early endosomal antigen-1 (EEA1), Smad, and phosphorylated Smad (pSmad) in nuclear fraction of HBMEC. A series of inhibition and silencing studies indicated that Smad and EEA1 closely interact by influencing their own nuclear entry; the effect that was attenuated by dynasore, a blocker of GTP-ase activity of dynamin. Importantly, inhibition of dynamin, EEA1, or TGF-β/Smad effectively attenuated HIV-1-induced Aβ accumulation in the nuclei of HBMEC. The present study indicates that nuclear uptake of Aβ involves the dynamin-dependent EEA1 and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathways. These results identify potential novel targets to protect against HIV-1-associated dysregulation of amyloid processes at the BBB level.

Abstract: Fas ligand (FasL) is a death factor of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. Like other members of this family of type II transmembrane proteins, FasL is subject to ectodomain shedding by a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) liberating soluble FasL and leaving membrane-integral N-terminal fragments (NTFs). These NTFs are further processed by intramembrane proteolysis through signal peptide peptidase-like 2a (SPPL2a), releasing intracellular domains (ICDs) which might translocate to the nucleus to regulate transcription. Previous work established that the proline-rich domain within the cytosolic N-terminus of FasL is required for protein–protein interactions with different Src homology 3 (SH3) or WW domain proteins. Distinct binding partners regulate FasL storage and surface appearance or are involved in other aspects of FasL biology. Given the large number of FasL interactors, we asked whether proteolytically processed FasL fragments associate with the same or distinct sets of SH3 domain proteins. To address this, we performed co-precipitation experiments using a monoclonal antibody directed against the FasL N-terminus for subsequent protein detection of full length FasL and NTFs/ICDs in Western blots. We demonstrate that members of the sorting nexin (SNX) family bind full length FasL and its N-terminal fragments whereas members of the Pombe Cdc15 homology (PCH) protein family bind full length FasL, but fail to associate with processed FasL. Thus, we provide first evidence that full length FasL and FasL fragments display selectivity regarding their association with intracellular binding partners. The differential binding most likely governs the fate and function of the intracellular FasL fragments.

Abstract: Self-reactive T cells have shown to have a potential role as regulators of the immune system preventing or even suppressing autoimmunity. One of the most abundant proteins that can be eluted from human HLA molecules is heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). The aims of the current study are to identify HSP70 epitopes based on published HLA elution studies and to investigate whether T cells from healthy individuals may respond to such self-epitopes. A literature search and subsequent in silico binding prediction based on theoretical MHC binding motifs resulted in the identification of seven HSP70 epitopes. PBMCs of healthy controls proliferated after incubation with two of the seven peptides (H167 and H290). Furthermore H161, H290, and H443 induced CD69 expression or production of cytokines IFNγ or TNFα in healthy controls. The identification of these naturally presented epitopes and the response they elicit in the normal immune system make them potential candidates to study during inflammatory conditions as well as in autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiated cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) after overexpressing four transcription factors, of which Oct4 is essential. To elucidate the role of Oct4 during reprogramming, we investigated the immediate transcriptional response to inducible Oct4 overexpression in various somatic murine cell types using microarray analysis. By downregulating somatic-specific genes, Oct4 induction influenced each transcriptional program in a unique manner. A significant upregulation of pluripotent markers could not be detected. Therefore, OCT4 facilitates reprogramming by interfering with the somatic transcriptional network rather than by directly initiating a pluripotent gene-expression program. Finally, Oct4 overexpression upregulated the gene Mgarp in all the analyzed cell types. Strikingly, Mgarp expression decreases during the first steps of reprogramming due to a KLF4-dependent inhibition. At later stages, OCT4 counteracts the repressive activity of KLF4, thereby enhancing Mgarp expression. We show that this temporal expression pattern is crucial for the efficient generation of iPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Wild birds harbor a large gene pool of influenza A viruses that have the potential to cause influenza pandemics. Foreseeing and understanding this potential is important for effective surveillance. Our phylogenetic and geographic analyses revealed the global prevalence of avian influenza virus genes whose proteins differ only a few amino acids from the 1918 pandemic influenza virus, suggesting that 1918-like pandemic viruses may emerge in the future. To assess this risk, we generated and characterized a virus composed of avian influenza viral segments with high homology to the 1918 virus. This virus exhibited pathogenicity in mice and ferrets higher than that in an authentic avian influenza virus. Further, acquisition of seven amino acid substitutions in the viral polymerases and the hemagglutinin surface glycoprotein conferred respiratory droplet transmission to the 1918-like avian virus in ferrets, demonstrating that contemporary avian influenza viruses with 1918 virus-like proteins may have pandemic potential.

Abstract: Summary
The detailed mechanism of reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) remains largely unknown. Partially reprogrammed iPSCs are informative and useful for understanding the mechanism of reprogramming but remain technically difficult to generate in a predictable and reproducible manner. Using replication-defective and persistent Sendai virus (SeVdp) vectors, we analyzed the effect of decreasing the expression levels of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC and found that low KLF4 expression reproducibly gives rise to a homogeneous population of partially reprogrammed iPSCs. Upregulation of KLF4 allows these cells to resume reprogramming, indicating that they are paused iPSCs that remain on the path toward pluripotency. Paused iPSCs with different KLF4 expression levels remain at distinct intermediate stages of reprogramming. This SeVdp-based stage-specific reprogramming system (3S reprogramming system) is applicable for both mouse and human somatic cells and will facilitate the mechanistic analysis of reprogramming.

Abstract: Interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene expression is highly up-regulated in canine hemangiosarcoma (HSA); however, its role in the pathogenesis of this disease is unknown. We investigated the expression of IL-8 in canine HSA tissues and cell lines, as well and the effects of IL-8 on canine HSA in vitro, and in vivo using a mouse xenograft model for the latter. Constitutive expression of IL-8 mRNA, IL-8 protein, and IL-8 receptor were variable among different tumor samples and cell lines, but they showed stable steady states in each cell line. Upon the addition of IL-8, HSA cells showed transient intracellular calcium fluxes, suggesting that their IL-8 receptors are functional and that IL-8 binding activates relevant signaling pathways. Yet, neither addition of exogenous IL-8 nor blockade of endogenous IL-8 by neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody (α-IL-8 Ab) affected HSA cell proliferation or survival in vitro. To assess potential effects of IL-8 in other tumor constituents, we stratified HSA cell lines and whole tumor samples into “IL-8 high” and “IL-8 low” groups. Genome-wide gene expression profiling showed that samples in the “IL-8 high” tumor group were enriched for genes associated with a “reactive microenvironment,” including activation of coagulation, inflammation, and fibrosis networks. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the effects of IL-8 on these tumors were mostly indirect, regulating interactions with the microenvironment. This hypothesis was supported by in vivo xenograft experiments where survival and engraftment of tumor cells was inhibited by administration of neutralizing α-IL-8 Ab. Together, our results suggest that IL-8 contributes to establishing a permissive microenvironment during the early stages of tumorigenesis in HSA.

Abstract: The cytoskeleton of human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells is known to be altered in glaucoma and has been hypothesized to reduce outflow facility through contracting the HTM tissue. Latrunculin B (Lat-B) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors disrupt the actin cytoskeleton and are in clinical trials as glaucoma therapeutics. We have previously reported a transient increase in HTM cell stiffness peaking at 90min after Lat-B treatment with a return to pretreatment values after 270min. We hypothesize that changes in actin morphology correlate with alterations in cell stiffness induced by Lat-B but this is not a general consequence of other cytoskeletal disrupting agents such as Rho kinase inhibitors. We treated HTM cells with 2µM Lat-B or 100µM Y-27632 and allowed the cells to recover for 30–270min. While examining actin morphology in Lat-B treated cells, we observed striking cortical actin arrays (CAAs). The percentage of CAA positive cells (CPCs) was time dependent and exceeded 30% at 90min and decreased after 270min. Y-27632 treated cells exhibited few CAAs and no changes in cell stiffness. Together, these data suggest that the increase in cell stiffness after Lat-B treatment is correlated with CAAs.

Abstract: The transcription factor p63, member of the p53 gene family, encodes for two main isoforms, TAp63 and ΔNp63 with distinct functions on epithelial homeostasis and cancer. Recently, we discovered that TAp63 is essential for in vitro cardiogenesis and heart development in vivo. TAp63 is expressed by embryonic endoderm and acts on cardiac progenitors by a cell-non-autonomous manner. In the present study, we search for cardiogenic secreted factors that could be regulated by TAp63 and, by ChIP-seq analysis, identified Angiomodulin (AGM), also named IGFBP7 or IGFBP-rP1. We demonstrate that AGM is necessary for cardiac commitment of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and its regulation depends on TAp63 isoform. TAp63 directly activates both AGM and Activin-A during ESC cardiogenesis while these secreted factors modulate TAp63 gene expression by a feedback loop mechanism. The molecular circuitry controlled by TAp63 on AGM/Activin-A signaling pathway and thus on cardiogenesis emphasizes the importance of p63 during early cardiac development.

Abstract: The acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by chromosomal translocations that result in fusion proteins, including the promyelocytic leukemia–retinoic acid receptor, alpha fusion protein (PML–RARα). All-trans retinoic acid (atRA) treatment is the standard drug treatment for APL yielding cure rates >80% by activating transcription and proteasomal degradation of retinoic acid receptor, alpha (RARα). Whereas combination therapy with As2O3 has increased survival further, patients that experience relapse and are refractory to atRA and/or As2O3 is a clinically significant problem. BCL-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis and over-expression of anti-apoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family proteins has been associated with chemotherapeutic resistance in APL including impairment of the ability of atRA to induce growth arrest and differentiation. Here we investigated the novel BH3 domain mimetic, JY-1-106, which antagonizes the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-xL) and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) alone and in combination with retinoids including atRA, AM580 (RARα agonist), and SR11253 (RARγ antagonist). JY-1-106 reduced cell viability in HL-60 cells alone and in combination with retinoids. The combination of JY-1-106 and SR11253 had the greatest impact on cell viability by stimulating apoptosis. These studies indicate that dual BCL-xL/MCL-1 inhibitors and retinoids could work cooperatively in leukemia treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular pathogens directly alter host cells in order to replicate and survive. While infection-induced changes in host transcription can be readily assessed, posttranscriptional alterations are more difficult to catalog. We applied the global protein stability (GPS) platform, which assesses protein stability based on relative changes in an adjoining fluorescent tag, to identify changes in the host proteome following infection with the obligate intracellular bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis. Our results indicate that C. trachomatis profoundly remodels the host proteome independently of changes in transcription. Additionally, C. trachomatis replication depends on a subset of altered proteins, such as Pin1 and Men1, that regulate the host transcription factor AP-1 controlling host inflammation, stress, and cell survival. Furthermore, AP-1-dependent transcription is activated during infection and required for efficient Chlamydia growth. In summary, this experimental approach revealed that C. trachomatis broadly alters host proteins and can be applied to examine host-pathogen interactions and develop host-based therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal inherited lipid storage disorder causing severe neurodegeneration and liver dysfunction with only limited treatment options for patients. Loss of NPC1 function causes defects in cholesterol metabolism and has recently been implicated in deregulation of autophagy. Here, we report the generation of isogenic pairs of NPC patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). We observed decreased cell viability, cholesterol accumulation, and dysfunctional autophagic flux in NPC1-deficient human hepatic and neural cells. Genetic correction of a disease-causing mutation rescued these defects and directly linked NPC1 protein function to impaired cholesterol metabolism and autophagy. Screening for autophagy-inducing compounds in disease-affected human cells showed cell type specificity. Carbamazepine was found to be cytoprotective and effective in restoring the autophagy defects in both NPC1-deficient hepatic and neuronal cells and therefore may be a promising treatment option with overall benefit for NPC disease.

Abstract: Summary
The Arabidopsis immune receptor FLS2 senses the bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate transient elevation of cytosolic calcium ions, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and other signaling events to coordinate antimicrobial defenses, such as stomatal closure that limits bacterial invasion. However, how FLS2 regulates these signaling events remains largely unknown. Here we show that the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1, a component of the FLS2 immune receptor complex, not only positively regulates flg22-triggered calcium influx but also directly phosphorylates the NADPH oxidase RbohD at specific sites in a calcium-independent manner to enhance ROS generation. Furthermore, BIK1 and RbohD form a pathway that controls stomatal movement in response to flg22, thereby restricting bacterial entry into leaf tissues. These findings highlight a direct role of the FLS2 complex in the regulation of RbohD-mediated ROS production and stomatal defense.

Abstract: In most eukaryotes, Cdc37 is an essential chaperone, transiently associating with newly synthesised protein kinases in order to promote their stabilisation and activation. To determine whether the yeast Cdc37 participates in any stable protein interactions in vivo, genomic two-hybrid screens were conducted using baits that are functional as they preserve the integrity of the conserved N-terminal region of Cdc37, namely a Cdc37-Gal4 DNA binding domain (BD) fusion in both its wild type and its S14 nonphosphorylatable (Cdc37(S14A)) mutant forms. While this failed to identify the protein kinases previously identified as Cdc37 interactors in pull-down experiments, it did reveal Cdc37 engaging in a stable association with the most atypical member of the yeast kinome, cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1)-activating kinase (Cak1). Phosphorylation of the conserved S14 of Cdc37 is normally crucial for the interaction with, and stabilisation of, those protein kinase targets of Cdc37, Cak1 is unusual in that the lack of this Cdc37 S14 phosphorylation both reinforces Cak1:Cdc37 interaction and does not compromise Cak1 expression in vivo. Thus, this is the first Cdc37 client kinase found to be excluded from S14 phosphorylation-dependent interaction. The unusual stability of this Cak1:Cdc37 association may partly reflect unique structural features of the fungal Cak1.

Abstract: Summary
In the adult brain, self-renewal is essential for the persistence of neural stem cells (NSCs) throughout life, but its regulation is still poorly understood. One NSC can give birth to two NSCs or one NSC and one transient progenitor. A correct balance is necessary for the maintenance of germinal areas, and understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying NSC division mode is clearly important. Here, we report a function of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) receptor Patched in the direct control of long-term NSC self-renewal in the subependymal zone. We show that genetic conditional activation of SHH signaling in adult NSCs leads to their expansion and the depletion of their direct progeny. These phenotypes are associated in vitro with an increase in NSC symmetric division in a process involving NOTCH signaling. Together, our results demonstrate a tight control of adult neurogenesis and NSC renewal driven by Patched.

Abstract: Summary
The prevalence of hearing loss after damage to the mammalian cochlea has been thought to be due to a lack of spontaneous regeneration of hair cells, the primary receptor cells for sound. Here, we show that supporting cells, which surround hair cells in the normal cochlear epithelium, differentiate into new hair cells in the neonatal mouse following ototoxic damage. Using lineage tracing, we show that new hair cells, predominantly outer hair cells, arise from Lgr5-expressing inner pillar and third Deiters cells and that new hair cell generation is increased by pharmacological inhibition of Notch. These data suggest that the neonatal mammalian cochlea has some capacity for hair cell regeneration following damage alone and that Lgr5-positive cells act as hair cell progenitors in the cochlea.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a multistep process in which cytoplasmic components, including invading pathogens, are captured by autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with degradative lysosomes. Negative-strand RNA viruses, including paramyxoviruses, have been shown to alter autophagy, but the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. We demonstrate that human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) induces incomplete autophagy by blocking autophagosome-lysosome fusion, resulting in increased virus production. The viral phosphoprotein (P) is necessary and sufficient to inhibition autophagosome degradation. P binds to SNAP29 and inhibits its interaction with syntaxin17, thereby preventing these two host SNARE proteins from mediating autophagosome-lysome fusion. Incomplete autophagy and resultant autophagosome accumulation increase extracellular viral production but do not affect viral protein synthesis. These findings highlight how viruses can block autophagosome degradation by disrupting the function of SNARE proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Aging hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibit defective lineage specification that is thought to be central to increased incidence of myeloid malignancies and compromised immune competence in the elderly. Mechanisms underlying these age-related defects remain largely unknown. We show that the deacetylase Sirtuin (SIRT)1 is required for homeostatic HSC maintenance. Differentiation of young SIRT1-deleted HSCs is skewed toward myeloid lineage associated with a significant decline in the lymphoid compartment, anemia, and altered expression of associated genes. Combined with HSC accumulation of damaged DNA and expression patterns of age-linked molecules, these have striking overlaps with aged HSCs. We further show that SIRT1 controls HSC homeostasis via the longevity transcription factor FOXO3. These findings suggest that SIRT1 is essential for HSC homeostasis and lineage specification. They also indicate that SIRT1 might contribute to delaying HSC aging.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes severe visual impairment due in part to age-dependent impairment of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). It has been suggested that autologous human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) may represent a useful cell source for the generation of graft RPE. We generated hiPSC-derived RPE (hiPSC-RPE) cell sheets optimized to meet clinical use requirements, including quality, quantity, consistency, and safety. These cell sheets are generated as a monolayer of cells without any artificial scaffolds, express typical RPE markers, form tight junctions that exhibit polarized secretion of growth factors, and show phagocytotic ability and gene-expression patterns similar to those of native RPE. Additionally, upon transplantation, autologous nonhuman primate iPSC-RPE cell sheets showed no immune rejection or tumor formation. These results suggest that autologous hiPSC-RPE cell sheets may serve as a useful form of graft for use in tissue replacement therapy for AMD.

Abstract: Summary
Definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) develop in the aorta gonad mesonephros (AGM) region in a stepwise manner. Type I pre-HSCs express CD41 but lack CD45 expression, which is subsequently upregulated in type II pre-HSCs prior to their maturation into definitive HSCs. Here, using ex vivo modeling of HSC development, we identify precursors of definitive HSCs in the trunk of the embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) mouse embryo. These precursors, termed here pro-HSCs, are less mature than type I and II pre-HSCs. Although pro-HSCs are CD41+, they lack the CD43 marker, which is gradually upregulated in the developing HSC lineage. We show that stem cell factor (SCF), but not interleukin-3 (IL-3), is a major effector of HSC maturation during E9–E10. This study extends further the previously established hierarchical organization of the developing HSC lineage and presents it as a differentially regulated four-step process and identifies additional targets that could facilitate the generation of transplantable HSCs from pluripotent cells for clinical needs.

Abstract: Fish keratocytes are an established model in single cell motility but little is known about their collective migration. Initially, sheets migrate from the scale at ~145μm/h but over the course of 24h the rate of leading edge advance decreases to ~23μm/h. During this period, leader cells retain their ability to migrate rapidly when released from the sheet and follower cell area increases. After the addition of RGD peptide, leader cell lamellae are lost, altering migratory forces within the sheet, resulting in rapid retraction. Leader and follower cell states interconvert within minutes with changes in cell–cell adhesions. Leader cells migrate as single cells when they detach from the leading edge and single cells appear to become leader cells if they rejoin the sheet. Follower cells rapidly establish leader cell morphology during closing of holes formed during sheet expansion and revert to follower cell morphology after hole-closure. Inhibition of Rho associated kinase releases leader cells and halts advancement of the leading edge suggesting an important role for the intercellular actomyosin cable at the leading edge. In addition, the presence of the stationary scale orients direction of sheet migration which is characterized by a more uniform advance of the leading edge than in some cell line systems. These data establish fish keratocyte explant cultures as a collective cell migration system and suggest that cell–cell interactions determine the role of keratocytes within the migrating sheet.

Abstract: The actions of the transcription factor Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) in breast cancer have been shown to include both pro-oncogenic and anti-oncogenic activities which is influenced, at least in part, by the hormonal environment. However, direct regulation of Nrf2 by steroid hormones (estrogen and progesterone) has received only scant attention. Nrf2 is known to be regulated by its cytosolic binding protein, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), and by a Keap1-independent mechanism involving a series of phosphorylation steps mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β). Here, we report that estrogen (E2) increases Nrf2 activity in MCF7 breast cancer cells through activation of the PI3K/GSK3β pathway. Utilizing antioxidant response element (ARE)-containing luciferase reporter constructs as read-outs for Nrf2 activity, our data indicated that E2 increased ARE activity >14-fold and enhanced the action of the Nrf2 activators, tertiary butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) and sulforaphane (Sul) 4 to 9 fold compared with cells treated with tBHQ or Sul as single agents. This activity was shown to be an estrogen receptor-mediated phenomenon and was antagonized by progesterone. In addition to its action on the reporter constructs, mRNA and protein levels of heme oxygenase 1, an endogenous target gene of Nrf2, was markedly upregulated by E2 both alone and in combination with tBHQ. Importantly, E2-induced Nrf2 activation was completely suppressed by the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and Wortmannin while the GSK3β inhibitor CT99021 upregulated Nrf2 activity. Confirmation that E2 was, at least partly, acting through the PI3K/GSK3β pathway was indicated by our finding that E2 increased the phosphorylation status of both GSK3β and Akt, a well-characterized downstream target of PI3K. Together, these results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which E2 can regulate Nrf2 activity in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells and suggest that patients׳ hormonal status through this activity may play a significant role in some therapeutic outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Neurotropic viruses, including mammalian reovirus, must disseminate from an initial site of replication to the central nervous system (CNS), often binding multiple receptors to facilitate systemic spread. Reovirus engages junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) to disseminate hematogenously. However, JAM-A is dispensable for reovirus replication in the CNS. We demonstrate that reovirus binds Nogo receptor NgR1, a leucine-rich repeat protein expressed in the CNS, to infect neurons. Expression of NgR1 confers reovirus binding and infection of nonsusceptible cells. Incubating reovirus virions with soluble NgR1 neutralizes infectivity. Blocking NgR1 on transfected cells or primary cortical neurons abrogates reovirus infection. Concordantly, reovirus infection is ablated in primary cortical neurons derived from NgR1 null mice. Reovirus virions bind to soluble JAM-A and NgR1, while infectious disassembly intermediates (ISVPs) bind only to JAM-A. These results suggest that reovirus uses different capsid components to bind distinct cell-surface molecules, engaging independent receptors to facilitate spread and tropism.

Abstract: Human circulating endothelial progenitor cells isolated from peripheral blood generate in culture cells with features of endothelial cells named late-outgrowth endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC). In adult blood, ECFC display a constant quantitative and qualitative decline during life span. Even after expansion, it is difficult to reach the cell dose required for cell therapy of vascular diseases, thus limiting the clinical use of these cells. Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) are components from the extracellular matrix (ECM) that are able to interact and potentiate heparin binding growth factor (HBGF) activities. According to these relevant biological properties of GAG, we designed a GAG mimetic having the capacity to increase the yield of ECFC production from blood and to improve functionality of their endothelial outgrowth. We demonstrate that the addition of [OTR4131] mimetic during the isolation process of ECFC from Cord Blood induces a 3 fold increase in the number of colonies. Moreover, addition of [OTR4131] to cell culture media improves adhesion, proliferation, migration and self-renewal of ECFC. We provide evidence showing that GAG mimetics may have great interest for cell therapy applied to vascular regeneration therapy and represent an alternative to exogenous growth factor treatments to optimize potential therapeutic properties of ECFC.

Abstract: In the study, we investigated the effect of dicoumarol, an anti-coagulant agent with the inhibitory activity of NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in renal cancer cell. Combined treatment with dicoumarol and TRAIL significantly induced apoptosis in various human renal carcinoma cells including Caki, ACHN, and A498, but not in normal human skin fibroblasts (HSF) and mouse kidney cells (TMCK-1). When we elucidated the relevance of NQO1 in dicoumarol plus TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, both ES936 (a NQO1 inhibitor) and knockdown of NQO1 with siRNA had no effect on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that the stimulating effect of dicoumarol on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis is independent of NQO1 activity. We found that dicoumarol transcriptionally down-regulated Bcl-2 expression via inhibition of NF-κB and CREB activity, whereas it down-regulated Mcl-1 and c-FLIP expression at the post-translational level. Overexpression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, or c-FLIP overcame the dicoumarol plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis, indicating that down-regualtion of these anti-apoptotic proteins may critically contribute to the sensitizing effect of dicoumarol on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) modulate various biological processes, but their role in host antiviral responses is largely unknown. Here we identify a lncRNA as a key regulator of antiviral innate immunity. Following from the observation that a lncRNA that we call negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) was dramatically downregulated during infection with several viruses, we ectopically expressed NRAV in human cells or transgenic mice and found that it significantly promotes influenza A virus (IAV) replication and virulence. Conversely, silencing NRAV suppressed IAV replication and virus production, suggesting that reduction of NRAV is part of the host antiviral innate immune response to virus infection. NRAV negatively regulates the initial transcription of multiple critical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFITM3 and MxA, by affecting histone modification of these genes. Our results provide evidence for a lncRNA in modulating the antiviral interferon response.

Abstract: 1,1-Dimethyl-4-phenyl piperazine iodide (DMPP) is a synthetic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist that could reduce airway inflammation. In this study, we demonstrated that DMPP could dramatically inhibit glioma size maintained on the chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). We first performed MTT and BrdU incorporation experiments on U87 glioma cells in vitro to understand the mechanism involved. We established that DMPP did not significantly affect U87 cell proliferation and survival. We speculated that DMPP directly caused the tumor to regress by affecting the vasculature in and around the implanted tumor on our chick CAM model. Hence, we conducted detailed analysis of DMPP's inhibitory effects on angiogenesis. Three vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in vivo models were used in the study which included (1) early chick blood islands formation, (2) chick yolk-sac membrane (YSW) and (3) CAM models. The results revealed that DMPP directly suppressed all developmental stages involved in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis – possibly by acting through Ang-1 and HIF-2α signaling. In sum, our results show that DMPP could induce glioma regression grown on CAM by inhibiting vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.

Abstract: Peroxiredoxins, a group of antioxidant protein enzymes (PRDX1 to 6), are reported as antiatherogenic factors in animals; however, human studies are lacking. The present work aims to provide baseline data regarding the phenotype of PRDX1, 2, 4, and 6 in diabetic patients with peripheral atherosclerosis disease (PAD) and their relation to endothelial dysfunction (ED) and disease severity. Plasma levels of PRDX1, 2, 4, and 6 and markers of endothelial dysfunction (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) were measured using ELISA in 55 type 2 diabetic patients having PAD and 25 healthy subjects. Ankle–brachial index (ABI), body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, HbA1c, and insulin resistance (HOMA IR) were measured. PRDX1, 2, 4, and 6 levels were significantly higher in patients compared to controls (PRDX1 21.9±5.71 vs 16.8±3.9 ng/ml, P < 0.001, PRDX2 36.5±14.83 vs 20.4±8.61 ng/ml, P < 0.001, PRDX4 3,840 ± 1,440 vs 2,696 ± 1,972 pg/ml, P < 0.005, PRDX6 311 ± 110 vs 287.9 ± 114 pg/ml, P < 0.05). PRDX1 and PRDX4 correlated negatively with ABI (r = −0.273, P < 0.05 and r = −0.28, P < 0.05, respectively), while PRDX1 and PRDX2 correlated positively with HOMA/IR and TG (r = 0.276, P < 0.01 and r = 0.295, P < 0.01, respectively). ICAM-1 was associated with PRDX2 and log PRDX6 (r = 0.345, P = 0.0037 and r = 0.344, P = 0.0038). Our results provide strong links among PRDXs, ED, and severity of PAD in diabetic patients which warrants further evaluation to clarify whether high circulating levels of PRDXs are a consequence of chronic atherosclerotic disease or a predisposing factor for later cardiovascular events.

Abstract: Summary
The concept of the “neurovascular unit,” emphasizing the interactions between neural and vascular components in the brain, raised the notion that neural progenitor cell (NPC) transplantation therapy aimed at neural repair may be insufficient for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Here, we demonstrate that enhanced neurovascular recovery via cotransplantation of NPCs and embryonic stem cell-derived vascular progenitor cells (VPCs) in a rat stroke model is correlated with improved functional recovery after stroke. We found that cotransplantation promoted the survival, migration, differentiation, and maturation of neuronal and vascular cells derived from the cotransplanted progenitors. Furthermore, it triggered an increased generation of VEGF-, BDNF-, and IGF1-expressing neural cells derived from the grafted NPCs. Consistently, compared with transplantation of NPCs alone, cotransplantation more effectively improved the neurobehavioral deficits and attenuated the infarct volume. Thus, cotransplantation of NPCs and VPCs represents a more effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of stroke than transplantation of NPCs alone.

Molecular mechanism of 2-APB-induced Ca2+ influx in external acidification in PC12,

Abstract: 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) is used as a pharmacological tool because it antagonizes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) channels, and activates some TRP channels. Recently, we reported that 2-APB enhanced the increase in cytotoxic [Ca2+]i, resulting in cell death under external acidic conditions in rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12. However, the molecular mechanism and functional role of the 2-APB-induced Ca2+ influx in PC12 have not been clarified. In this study, to identify the possible target for the action of 2-APB we examined the pharmacological and molecular properties of [Ca2+]i and secretory responses to 2-APB under extracellular low pH conditions. 2-APB dose-dependently induced a [Ca2+]i increase and dopamine release, which were greatly enhanced by the external acidification (pH 6.5). [Ca2+]i and secretory responses to 2-APB at pH 6.5 were inhibited by the removal of extracellular Ca2+ and SOC channel blockers such as SK&F96365, La3+ and Gd3+. PC12 expressed all SOC channel molecules, Orai 1, Orai 2 and Orai 3. When we used an siRNA system, downregulation of Orai 3, but not Orai 1 and Orai 2, attenuated both [Ca2+]i and secretory responses to 2-APB. These results suggest that 2-APB evokes external acid-dependent increases of [Ca2+]i and dopamine release in PC12 through the activation of Orai 3. The present results indicate that 2-APB may be a useful pharmacological tool for Orai channel-related signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of functional spermatids from azoospermia patients is of unusual significance in the treatment of male infertility. Here, we report an efficient approach to obtain human functional spermatids from cryptorchid patients. Spermatogonia remained whereas meiotic germ cells were rare in cryptorchid patients. Expression of numerous markers for meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells was enhanced in human spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) of cryptorchidism patients by retinoic acid (RA) and stem cell factor (SCF) treatment. Meiotic spreads and DNA content assays revealed that RA and SCF induced a remarkable increase of SCP3-, MLH1-, and CREST-positive cells and haploid cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reflected distinct global gene profiles in embryos derived from round spermatids and nuclei of somatic cells. Significantly, haploid spermatids generated from human SSCs of cryptorchid patients possessed fertilization and development capacity. This study thus provides an invaluable source of autologous male gametes for treating male infertility in azoospermia patients.

Abstract: An experiment was conducted to evaluate the role of different lipotropes in modulating immunity and biochemical plasticity under conditions of sublethal low-dose pesticide-induced stress in fish. Labeo rohita fish fingerlings were divided in two sets with one set of fish continuously exposed to low-dose endosulfan (1/10th of 96-h LC50) for 21 days, the other was unexposed, and both sets of fish were fed with practical diets supplemented with either 2 % lecithin, 0.5 % betaine, or 0.1 % choline and compared against unsupplemented diet. Low-dose endosulfan exposure had adverse effects (P < 0.05/P < 0.01) on hematological profile (erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit), serum protein (total protein, albumin, and globulin) and lipid profile (cholesterol and triglyceride), anti-oxidative status (ascorbic acid content of muscle, liver, brain, and kidney and activity of anti-oxidative enzymes: catalase and superoxide dismutase), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle and brain), immunological attributes (WBC count, albumin to globulin ratio, phagocytic activity, and serum cortisol), and metabolic plasticity as revealed from enzyme activities (muscle lactate dehydrogenase, liver and kidney glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase-G6PDH activity). Dietary lipotropes prevented these effects completely or partially and the effects were lipotrope dependent. Kinetics (maximum velocity value Vmax, catalytic efficiency and Michaelis constant Km) of G6PDH enzyme from crude extracts of liver and kidney indicated inhibition due to endosulfan but lipotropes could protect enzyme and showed a stabilizing effect. The supplements also helped maintain integrity of histoarchitecture of the hepatocytes in endosulfan-exposed fish to a great extent. Feeding lipotropes to fish reared in endosulfan-free water also improved hematological and serum protein and lipid profiles and were immunostimulatory. In conclusion, dietary lipotropes, especially betaine and lecithin at the levels used, improve erythropoiesis, serum protein and lipid profile, anti-oxidant status, immunocompetence, neurotransmission, and protect the livers of L. rohita fingerlings even when continuously exposed to low-dose endosulfan.

Abstract: Summary
Long-QT syndrome mutations can cause syncope and sudden death by prolonging the cardiac action potential (AP). Ion channels affected by mutations are various, and the influences of cellular calcium cycling on LQTS cardiac events are unknown. To better understand LQTS arrhythmias, we performed current-clamp and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) measurements on cardiomyocytes differentiated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS-CM). In myocytes carrying an LQT2 mutation (HERG-A422T), APs and [Ca2+]i transients were prolonged in parallel. APs were abbreviated by nifedipine exposure and further lengthened upon releasing intracellularly stored Ca2+. Validating this model, control iPS-CM treated with HERG-blocking drugs recapitulated the LQT2 phenotype. In LQT3 iPS-CM, expressing NaV1.5-N406K, APs and [Ca2+]i transients were markedly prolonged. AP prolongation was sensitive to tetrodotoxin and to inhibiting Na+-Ca2+ exchange. These results suggest that LQTS mutations act partly on cytosolic Ca2+ cycling, potentially providing a basis for functionally targeted interventions regardless of the specific mutation site.

Abstract: The influence of hypertonic solution on dye coupling was investigated in cell pairs isolated from the left ventricle of adult Sprague Dawley rats.The hypertonic solution together with Lucifer Yellow CH, were dialyzed into one cell of the pair using the whole cell clamp tecnique, and the diffusion of dye in the dialyzed as well as in non-dialyzed cell, was followed by measuring the intensity of fluorescence in both cells as a function of time.The results indicated that: (1) Lucifer Yellow CH dialyzed into one cell of the pair diffuses easily into the nondialyzed cell through gap junctions; (2) the intracellular dialysis of an hypertonic solution into one cell of the pair, increases the area of the dialyzed cell and reduced the area of the non-dialyzed cell suggesting intercellular movement of water; (3) the hypertonic solution dialyzed into one cell of the pair abolished the dye coupling; (4) the gap junction permeability (Pj) estimated before and after administration of hypertonic solution showed an appreciably decrease of Pj; (5) angiotensin (1–7) (Ang (1–7) (10–9M) administered to the bath re-established the dye coupling abolished by hypertonic solution and reduced the cell area; (6) the effect of Ang (1–7) was related to the activation of Mas receptor and was dependent on the activation of PKA. Conclusions: the reestablishment of dye coupling elicited by Ang (1–7) seen in cell pairs dialyzed with hypertonic solution, might indicate that under similar conditions like that seen during myocardial ischemia, the peptide might be of benefit preventing the impairment of cell communication and impulse propagation associated with cardiac reentrant arrhytmias.

Abstract: The development of novel platforms for large scale production of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) derived cardiomyocytes (CM) becomes more crucial as the demand for CMs in preclinical trials, high throughput cardio toxicity assays and future regenerative therapeutics rises. To this end, we have designed a microcarrier (MC) suspension agitated platform that integrates pluripotent hESC expansion followed by CM differentiation in a continuous, homogenous process. Hydrodynamic shear stresses applied during the hESC expansion and CM differentiation steps drastically reduced the capability of the cells to differentiate into CMs. Applying vigorous stirring during pluripotent hESC expansion on Cytodex 1 MC in spinner cultures resulted in low CM yields in the following differentiation step (cardiac troponin-T (cTnT): 22.83±2.56%; myosin heavy chain (MHC): 19.30±5.31%). Whereas the lower shear experienced in side to side rocker (wave type) platform resulted in higher CM yields (cTNT: 47.50±7.35%; MHC: 42.85±2.64%). The efficiency of CM differentiation is also affected by the hydrodynamic shear stress applied during the first 3days of the differentiation stage. Even low shear applied continuously by side to side rocker agitation resulted in very low CM differentiation efficiency (cTnT<5%; MHC<2%). Simply by applying intermittent agitation during these 3days followed by continuous agitation for the subsequent 9days, CM differentiation efficiency can be substantially increased (cTNT: 65.73±10.73%; MHC: 59.73±9.17%). These yields are 38.3% and 39.3% higher (for cTnT and MHC respectively) than static culture control. During the hESC expansion phase, cells grew on continuously agitated rocker platform as pluripotent cell/MC aggregates (166±88×105μm2) achieving a cell concentration of 3.74±0.55×106cells/mL (18.89±2.82 fold expansion) in 7days. These aggregates were further differentiated into CMs using a WNT modulation differentiation protocol for the subsequent 12days on a rocking platform with an intermittent agitation regime during the first 3days. Collectively, the integrated MC rocker platform produced 190.5±58.8×106 CMs per run (31.75±9.74 CM/hESC seeded). The robustness of the system was demonstrated by using 2 cells lines, hESC (HES-3) and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) IMR-90. The CM/MC aggregates formed extensive sarcomeres that exhibited cross-striations confirming cardiac ontogeny. Functionality of the CMs was demonstrated by monitoring the effect of inotropic drug, Isoproterenol on beating frequency. In conclusion, we have developed a simple robust and scalable platform that integrates both hESC expansion and CM differentiation in one unit process which is capable of meeting the need for large amounts of CMs.

Abstract: Stem cells are attractive tools to develop new therapeutic strategies for a variety of disorders. While ethical and technical issues, associated with embryonic, fetal and neural stem cells, limit the translation to clinical applications, the nasal stem cells identified in the human olfactory mucosa stand as a promising candidate for stem cell-based therapies. Located in the back of the nose, this multipotent stem cell type is readily accessible in humans, a feature that makes these cells highly suitable for the development of autologous cell-based therapies. However, preclinical studies based on autologous transplantation of rodent olfactory stem cells are impeded because of the narrow opening of the nasal cavity. In this study, we report the development of a unique method permitting to quickly and safely biopsy olfactory mucosa in rats. Using this newly developed technique, rat stem cells expressing the stem cell marker Nestin were successfully isolated without requiring the sacrifice of the donor animal. As an evidence of the self-renewal capacity of the isolated cells, several millions of rat cells were amplified from a single biopsy within four weeks. Using an olfactory discrimination test, we additionally showed that this novel biopsy method does not affect the sense of smell and the learning and memory abilities of the operated animals. This study describes for the first time a methodology allowing the derivation of rat nasal cells in a way that is suitable for studying the effects of autologous transplantation of any cell type present in the olfactory mucosa in a wide variety of rat models.

Abstract: Nanofiber-expanded human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cell therapy is under consideration for treating peripheral and cardiac ischemia. However, the therapeutic efficacy of nanofiber-expanded human umbilical cord blood-derived (NEHUCB) CD34+ cell therapy for wound healing and its mechanisms are yet to be established. Using an excision wound model in NOD/SCID mice, we show herein that NEHUCB-CD34+ cells home to the wound site and significantly accelerate the wound-healing process compared to vehicle-treated control. Histological analysis reveals that accelerated wound closure is associated with the re-epithelialization and increased angiogenesis. Additionally, NEHUCB-CD34+ cell-therapy decreases expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and NOS2A in the wound bed, and concomitantly increases expression of IL-10 compared to vehicle-treated control. These findings were recapitulated in vitro using primary dermal fibroblasts and NEHUCB-CD34+ cells. Moreover, NEHUCB-CD34+ cells attenuate NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation in dermal fibroblasts through enhanced secretion of IL-10, which is known to bind to NF-κB and suppress transcriptional activity. Collectively, these data provide novel mechanistic evidence of NEHUCB-CD34+ cell-mediated accelerated wound healing.

Abstract: Summary
A large number of point mutations have been identified in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) genomes to date. Whether these mutations are associated with iPSC generation is an important and controversial issue. In this study, we approached this critical issue in different ways, including an assessment of iPSCs versus embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and an investigation of variant allele frequencies and the heterogeneity of point mutations within a single iPSC clone. Through these analyses, we obtained strong evidence that iPSC-generation-associated point mutations occur frequently in a transversion-predominant manner just after the onset of cell lineage conversion. The heterogeneity of the point mutation profiles within an iPSC clone was also revealed and reflects the history of the emergence of each mutation. Further, our results suggest a possible approach for establishing iPSCs with fewer point mutations.

Abstract: Several human worldwide diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, atherosclerosis and other metabolic pathologies are related to the excessive accumulation of lipids in cells. Lipids accumulate in spherical cellular inclusions called lipid droplets (LDs) whose sizes range from fraction to one hundred of micrometers in adipocytes. It has been suggested that LDs can grow in size due to a fusion process by which a larger LD is obtained with spherical shape and volume equal to the sum of the progenitors’ ones. In this study, the size distribution of two populations of LDs was analyzed in immature and mature (5-days differentiated) 3T3-L1 adipocytes (first and second populations, respectively) after Oil Red O staining. A Monte Carlo simulation of interaction between LDs has been developed in order to quantify the size distribution and the number of fusion events needed to obtain the distribution of the second population size starting from the first one. Four models are presented here based on different kinds of interaction: a surface weighted interaction (R2 Model), a volume weighted interaction (R3 Model), a random interaction (Random model) and an interaction related to the place where the LDs are born (Nearest Model). The last two models mimic quite well the behavior found in the experimental data. This work represents a first step in developing numerical simulations of the LDs growth process. Due to the complex phenomena involving LDs (absorption, growth through additional neutral lipid deposition in existing droplets, de novo formation and catabolism) the study focuses on the fusion process. The results suggest that, to obtain the observed size distribution, a number of fusion events comparable with the number of LDs themselves is needed. Moreover the MC approach results a powerful tool for investigating the LDs growth process.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology have set the stage for routine derivation of patient- and disease-specific human iPSC-cardiomyocyte (CM) models for preclinical drug screening and personalized medicine approaches. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are an advantageous source of somatic cells because they are easily obtained and readily amenable to transduction. Here, we report that the electrophysiological properties and pharmacological responses of PBMC-derived iPSC CM are generally similar to those of iPSC CM derived from other somatic cells, using patch-clamp, calcium transient, and multielectrode array (MEA) analyses. Distinct iPSC lines derived from a single patient display similar electrophysiological features and pharmacological responses. Finally, we demonstrate that human iPSC CMs undergo acute changes in calcium-handling properties and gene expression in response to rapid electrical stimulation, laying the foundation for an in-vitro-tachypacing model system for the study of human tachyarrhythmias.

Abstract: Ambient particulate matter (PM) exposure has been associated with atherosclerosis. However, research on the effect of real-world exposure to ambient PM in regulating visfatin expression in an animal model is very limited. The objective is to investigate whether Beijing ambient PM exposure could accelerate atherosclerosis in ApoE knockout (ApoE−/−) mice by upregulating visfatin expression. Forty male ApoE−/− mice were exposed to untreated ambient air (PM group, n = 20) or filtered air (FA group, n = 20), 24 h/day, 7 days/week, for 2 months. During the exposure, the mass concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 in the two groups were continuously monitored. Moreover, a receptor source apportionment model was applied to apportion sources of PM2.5. At the end of the exposure, visfatin in plasma and aorta, biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism in blood samples, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined, and the plaque area of the atherosclerosis lesions was quantified. PM-exposed mice were significantly higher than FA-exposed mice in terms of plasma visfatin, OxLDL, MDA, serum TC, LDL, TNF-α as well as IL-6, TNF-α, OxLDL, and MDA in BALF, while SOD and GSH-Px activities in plasma and BALF were reduced in PM-exposed mice. Pathological analysis of the aorta demonstrated that the plaque area and visfatin protein in the PM group increased significantly compared to the FA group. Our findings indicate that ambient PM exposure could accelerate atherosclerosis, which is related to visfatin upregulation, as well as the activation of inflammation and oxidative stress.

Abstract: There is a considerable interest for the discovery and characterization of tumor-associated antigens, which may facilitate antibody-based pharmacodelivery strategies. Thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 are homologous secreted proteins, which have previously been reported to be overexpressed during remodeling typical for wound healing and tumor progression and to possibly play a functional role in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. To our knowledge, a complete immunohistochemical characterization of thrombospondins levels in normal rodent tissues has not been reported so far. Using antibody phage technology, we have generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies specific to murine thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2, two antigens which share 62% aminoacid identity. An immunofluorescence analysis revealed that both antigens are virtually undetectable in normal mouse tissues, except for a weak staining of heart tissue by antibodies specific to thrombospondin-1. The analysis also showed that thrombospondin-1 was strongly expressed in 5/7 human tumors xenografted in nude mice, while it was only barely detectable in 3/8 murine tumors grafted in immunocompetent mice. By contrast, a high-affinity antibody to thrombospondin-2 revealed a much lower level of expression of this antigen in cancer specimens. Our analysis resolves ambiguities related to conflicting reports on thrombosponding expression in health and disease. Based on our findings, thrombospondin-1 (and not thrombospondin-2) may be considered as a target for antibody-based pharmacodelivery strategies, in consideration of its low expression in normal tissues and its upregulation in cancer.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins constitute the most diverse and least conserved group within the large family of heat shock proteins, which play a crucial role in cell response to environmental insults. Chironomus riparius larvae are widely used in environmental research for testing pollutant toxicity in sediments and freshwater environments. Different genes, such as Hsp70, Hsc70, Hsp90, and Hsp40, have been identified in this species as sensitive biomarkers for xenobiotics, but small Hsps genes remain largely unknown. In this study, the Hsp27 has been characterized in C. riparius and its transcriptional response evaluated under several environmental stimuli. The Hsp27 gene was mapped by FISH on polytene chromosomes at region I-C4 and was found to encode a 195 aa protein, which contains an α-crystallin domain bounded by three conserved regions. This protein shows homology with Drosophila melanogaster HSP27, Ceratitis capitata HSP27, and Sarcophaga crassipalpis HSP25. Real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that heat shock (35 °C) and cadmium dramatically upregulate this gene. Moreover, exposures to triclosan and bisphenol A were able to significantly increase mRNA levels. However, neither nonylphenol nor tributyltin altered Hsp27 gene expression. The transcriptional activity of Hsp27 gene was modulated during cold stress. Interestingly, cold shock (4 °C) significantly reduced Hsp27 transcripts, but this gene was significantly overexpressed during the recovery time at the normal growing temperature. These results show that the Hsp27 gene is sensitive to different environmental stimuli, including endocrine-disrupting pollutants, suggesting its potential as a suitable biomarker for ecotoxicological studies in aquatic systems.

Abstract: Summary
It is clear that neural differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells generates cells that are developmentally immature. Here, we show that the let-7 plays a functional role in the developmental decision making of human neural progenitors, controlling whether these cells make neurons or glia. Through gain- and loss-of-function studies on both tissue and pluripotent derived cells, our data show that let-7 specifically regulates decision making in this context by regulation of a key chromatin-associated protein, HMGA2. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the let-7/HMGA2 circuit acts on HES5, a NOTCH effector and well-established node that regulates fate decisions in the nervous system. These data link the let-7 circuit to NOTCH signaling and suggest that this interaction serves to regulate human developmental progression.

Abstract: To gain insight into oral squamous cell carcinogenesis, we performed deep sequencing (RNAseq) of non-tumorigenic human OKF6-TERT1R and tumorigenic SCC-9 cells. Numerous homeobox genes are differentially expressed between OKF6-TERT1R and SCC-9 cells. Data from Oncomine, a cancer microarray database, also show that homeobox (HOX) genes are dysregulated in oral SCC patients. The activity of Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC), which causes epigenetic modifications, and retinoic acid (RA) signaling can control HOX gene transcription. HOXB7, HOXC10, HOXC13, and HOXD8 transcripts are higher in SCC-9 than in OKF6-TERT1R cells; using ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) we detected PRC2 protein SUZ12 and the epigenetic H3K27me3 mark on histone H3 at these genes in OKF6-TERT1R, but not in SCC-9 cells. In contrast, IRX1, IRX4, SIX2 and TSHZ3 transcripts are lower in SCC-9 than in OKF6-TERT1R cells. We detected SUZ12 and the H3K27me3 mark at these genes in SCC-9, but not in OKF6-TERT1R cells. SUZ12 depletion increased HOXB7, HOXC10, HOXC13, and HOXD8 transcript levels and decreased the proliferation of OKF6-TERT1R cells. Transcriptional responses to RA are attenuated in SCC-9 versus OKF6-TERT1R cells. SUZ12 and H3K27me3 levels were not altered by RA at these HOX genes in SCC-9 and OKF6-TERT1R cells. We conclude that altered activity of PRC2 is associated with dysregulation of homeobox gene expression in human SCC cells, and that this dysregulation potentially plays a role in the neoplastic transformation of oral keratinocytes.

Abstract: Natural BH3-memitic (-)-gossypol shows promising antitumor efficacy in several kinds of cancer. However, our previous studies have demonstrated that protective autophagy decreases the drug sensitivities of Bcl-2 inhibitors in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In the present study, we are the first to report that Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG enhanced (-)-gossypol-induced apoptosis via suppressing (-)-gossypol-triggered protective autophagy and Mcl-1 accumulation. The suppression effect of 17-AAG on autophagy was mediated by inhibiting ERK-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation while was not related to Beclin1 or LC3 protein instability. Meanwhile, 17-AAG downregulated (-)-gossypol-triggered Mcl-1 accumulation by suppressing Mcl-1Thr163 phosphorylation and promoting protein degradation. Collectively, our study indicates that Hsp90 plays an important role in tumor maintenance and inhibition of Hsp90 may become a new strategy for sensitizing Bcl-2-targeted chemotherapies in HCC cells.

Abstract: The mammalian stress protein Hsp105α is expressed constitutively and is further induced under stress conditions, whereas the alternative spliced form, Hsp105β is only expressed during mild heat shock. We previously reported that Hsp105α is localized mainly in the cytoplasm, whereas Hsp105β is localized in the nucleus. Consistent with the different localization of these proteins, Hsp105β but not Hsp105α induces the expression of the major stress protein Hsp70. We here identified N-myc and Stat interactor (Nmi), as an Hsp105β-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. Immunoprecipitation and pull-down assay showed that Nmi interacts with Hsp105β in vivo and in vitro. Luciferase reporter gene assay and Western blotting showed that Nmi enhanced both the Hsp105β-induced phosphorylation of Stat3 and the Hsp105β-induced activation of the hsp70 promoter in a manner that is dependent on the Stat3-binding site, which results in an increase in Hsp70 protein levels. Most importantly, mild heat shock-induced Hsp70 expression, which is dependent on Hsp105β, is suppressed by knockdown of endogenous Nmi. These results suggest that Nmi has a role as a positive regulator of Hsp105β-mediated hsp70 gene expression along the Stat3 signaling pathway.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived macrophage-like cells for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In previous studies, we established the technology to generate macrophage-like myeloid lineage cells with proliferating capacity from human iPS cells, and we designated the cells iPS-ML. iPS-ML reduced the level of Aβ added into the culture medium, and the culture supernatant of iPS-ML alleviated the neurotoxicity of Aβ. We generated iPS-ML expressing the Fc-receptor-fused form of a single chain antibody specific to Aβ. In addition, we made iPS-ML expressing Neprilysin-2 (NEP2), which is a protease with Aβ-degrading activity. In vitro, expression of NEP2 but not anti-Aβ scFv enhanced the effect to reduce the level of soluble Aβ oligomer in the culture medium and to alleviate the neurotoxicity of Aβ. To analyze the effect of iPS-ML expressing NEP2 (iPS-ML/NEP2) in vivo, we intracerebrally administered the iPS-ML/NEP2 to 5XFAD mice, which is a mouse model of AD. We observed significant reduction in the level of Aβ in the brain interstitial fluid following administration of iPS-ML/NEP2. These results suggested that iPS-ML/NEP2 may be a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of AD.

Abstract: Previous hypertension studies have shown that low levels of vitamin D are linked to elevated renin–angiotensin system. The heat shock protein 70 regulates signaling pathways for cellular oxidative stress responses. Hsp70 has been shown to protect against angiotensin II-induced hypertension and exert a cytoprotective effect. Here, we wanted to evaluate whether the vitamin D receptor (VDR) associated with Hsp70/AT1 expression may be involved in the mechanism by which paricalcitol provides renal protection in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). One-month-old female SHRs were treated for 4 months with vehicle, paricalcitol, enalapril, or a combination of both paricalcitol and enalapril. The following were determined: blood pressure; biochemical parameters; fibrosis; apoptosis; mitochondrial morphology; and VDR, AT1 receptor, and Hsp70 expression in the renal cortex. Blood pressure was markedly reduced by enalapril or the combination but not by paricalcitol alone. However, VDR activation, enalapril or combination, prevented fibrosis, the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells, mitochondrial damage, and NADPH oxidase activity in SHRs. Additionally, high AT1 receptor expression, like low Hsp70 expression (immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence studies), was reversed in the renal cortices of paricalcitol- and/or enalapril-treated animals (SHRs), and these changes were most marked in the combination therapy group. Finally, all of the recovery parameters were consistent with an improvement in VDR expression. Data suggest that Hsp70/AT1 modulated by VDR is involved in the mechanism by which paricalcitol provides renal protection in SHRs. We propose that low AT1 expression through VDR induction could be a consequence of the heat shock response Hsp70-mediated cell protection.

Abstract: Moderate levels of stress can be beneficial to health, while stress overload can cause injury or contribute to diseases. Despite a number of studies of adaptation or stress damage, the mechanisms of adaptation and stress damage remain far from clear. The effect and mechanisms of adaptation on cardiomyocytes damage caused by stress overload are discussed in this study. Data showed that mild repeated stress mitigated stress overload-induced cardiomyocyte injury both in an animal model of restraint stress and in H9C2 cells with GC (glucocorticoid) treatment. HSP70, HIP expression and interaction between HSP70 and HIP increased during adaptation induced by mild stress both in animals and H9C2 cells. Overexpression or inhibition of HSP70 in H9C2 cells with pCDNA-3.1-Hsp70 or KNK437 (HSP70 inhibitor) showed that HSP70 can protect H9C2 cells from GC-induced cell damage. A luciferase assay showed that Hsp70 plays its protective role through inhibition of GR transcription activity dependent on the interaction with HIP. These results indicated that HSP70 may promote adaptation with its interacting protein HIP, and increased levels of HSP70 and its interacting protein HIP during adaptation may play a protective role on stress-overload-induced cardiomyocyte injury.

Abstract: Dental tissues provide an alternative autologous source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for regenerative medicine. In this study, we isolated human dental MSCs of follicle, pulp and papilla tissue from a single donor tooth after impacted third molar extraction by excluding the individual differences. We then compared the morphology, proliferation rate, expression of MSC-specific and pluripotency markers, and in vitro differentiation ability into osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes and functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs). Finally, we analyzed the protein expression profiles of undifferentiated dental MSCs using 2DE coupled with MALDI-TOF-MS. Three types of dental MSCs largely shared similar morphology, proliferation potential, expression of surface markers and pluripotent transcription factors, and differentiation ability into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. Upon hepatogenic induction, all MSCs were transdifferentiated into functional HLCs, and acquired hepatocyte functions by showing their ability for glycogen storage and urea production. Based on the proteome profiling results, we identified nineteen proteins either found commonly or differentially expressed among the three types of dental MSCs. In conclusion, three kinds of dental MSCs from a single donor tooth possessed largely similar cellular properties and multilineage potential. Further, these dental MSCs had similar proteomic profiles, suggesting their interchangeable applications for basic research and call therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Conversion of EpiSCs to naive ESCs is a rare event that is driven by the reestablishment of the naive transcription factor network. In mice, STAT3 activation is sufficient to drive conversion of EpiSCs to the naive pluripotent stem cell (PSC) state. However, the lack of responsiveness of EpiSCs to LIF presents a bottleneck in this conversion process. Here, we demonstrate that local accumulation of BMP-SMAD1 signaling, in cooperation with GP130 ligands, enhances the recovery of LIF responsiveness by directly controlling transcription of the LIF receptor (Lif-r). Addition of BMP and LIF to EpiSCs increases both LIF responsiveness and conversion frequencies to naive PSCs. Mechanistically, we show that the transcriptional cofactor P300 plays a critical role by mediating complex formation between STAT3 and SMAD1. This demonstration of how the local microenvironment or stem cell niche reactivates dormant signaling responsiveness and developmental potential may be applicable to other stem cell niche-containing systems.

Abstract: Tunneling nanotubes (TnTs) are long, non-adherent, actin-based cellular extensions that act as conduits for transport of cellular cargo between connected cells. The mechanisms of nanotube formation and the effects of the tumor microenvironment and cellular signals on TnT formation are unknown. In the present study, we explored exosomes as potential mediators of TnT formation in mesothelioma and the potential relationship of lipid rafts to TnT formation. Mesothelioma cells co-cultured with exogenous mesothelioma-derived exosomes formed more TnTs than cells cultured without exosomes within 24–48h; and this effect was most prominent in media conditions (low-serum, hyperglycemic medium) that support TnT formation (1.3–1.9-fold difference). Fluorescence and electron microscopy confirmed the purity of isolated exosomes and revealed that they localized predominantly at the base of and within TnTs, in addition to the extracellular environment. Time-lapse microscopic imaging demonstrated uptake of tumor exosomes by TnTs, which facilitated intercellular transfer of these exosomes between connected cells. Mesothelioma cells connected via TnTs were also significantly enriched for lipid rafts at nearly a 2-fold higher number compared with cells not connected by TnTs. Our findings provide supportive evidence of exosomes as potential chemotactic stimuli for TnT formation, and also lipid raft formation as a potential biomarker for TnT-forming cells.

Abstract: Dendritic cells (DCs) are immune cells found in the peripheral tissues where they sample the organism for infections or malignancies. There they take up antigens and migrate towards immunological organs to contact and activate T lymphocytes that specifically recognize the antigen presented by these antigen presenting cells. In the steady state there are several types of resident DCs present in various different organs. For example, in the mouse, splenic DC populations characterized by the co-expression of CD11c and CD8 surface markers are specialized in cross-presentation to CD8 T cells, while CD11c/SIRP-1α DCs seem to be dedicated to activating CD4 T cells. On the other hand, DCs have also been associated with the development of various diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, or inflammatory conditions. In such disease, DCs can participate by inducing angiogenesis or immunosuppression (tumors), promoting autoimmune responses, or exacerbating inflammation (atherosclerosis). This change in DC biology can be prompted by signals in the microenvironment. We have previously shown that the interaction of DCs with various extracellular matrix components modifies the immune properties and angiogenic potential of these cells. Building on those studies, herewith we analyzed the angiogenic profile of murine myeloid DCs upon interaction with 2D and 3D type-I collagen environments. As determined by PCR array technology and quantitative PCR analysis we observed that interaction with these collagen environments induced the expression of particular angiogenic molecules. In addition, DCs cultured on collagen environments specifically upregulated the expression of CXCL-1 and -2 chemokines. We were also able to establish DC cultures on type-IV collagen environments, a collagen type expressed in pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis. When we examined DC populations in atherosclerotic veins of Apolipoprotein E deficient mice we observed that they expressed adhesion molecules capable of interacting with collagen. Finally, to further investigate the interaction of DCs with collagen in other pathological conditions, we determined that both murine ovarian and breast cancer cells express several collagen molecules that can contribute to shape their particular tumor microenvironment. Consistently, tumor-associated DCs were shown to express adhesion molecules capable of interacting with collagen molecules as determined by flow cytometry analysis. Of particular relevance, tumor-associated DCs expressed high levels of CD305/LAIR-1, an immunosuppressive receptor. This suggests that signaling through this molecule upon interaction with collagen produced by tumor cells might help define the poorly immunogenic status of these cells in the tumor microenvironment. Overall, these studies demonstrate that through interaction with collagen proteins, DCs can be capable of modifying the microenvironments of inflammatory disease such as cancer or atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Thrombomodulin (TM), a transmembrane glycoprotein on vascular endothelial cells, is a naturally occurring anticoagulant. Recombinant human soluble TM (rTM), composed of the extracellular domain of TM, also shows anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory activity, but the effects of rTM on microangiopathy remain unclear. We reported that FK506 induced endothelial dysfunction through inactivation of Akt and extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 using a three-dimensional culture blood vessel model. In the present study, we examined the effects of rTM on FK506-induced endothelial dysfunction. We found that rTM suppressed FK506-induced endothelial cell death, but not the breakdown of capillary-like tube structures. rTM prevented FK506-induced inactivation of Akt, but not of extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2. Akt inhibition by LY294002 abrogated the preventive effect of rTM on FK506-induced Akt inactivation and the suppressive effect of rTM on FK506-induced cell death. These results suggest that rTM attenuates FK506-induced endothelial dysfunction through prevention of Akt inactivation.

Abstract: We hypothesized that the effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) on bone formation is increased via osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), which is regulated by Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling. Our in vitro data showed that HBO increased cell proliferation, Wnt3a production, LRP6 phosphorylation, and cyclin D1 expression in osteogenically differentiated BMSCs. The mRNA and protein levels of Wnt3a, β-catenin, and Runx2 were upregulated while those of GSK-3β were downregulated after HBO treatment. The relative density ratio (phospho-protein/protein) of Akt and GSK-3β was both up-regulated while that of β-catenin was down-regulated after HBO treatment. We next investigated whether HBO affects the accumulation of β-catenin. Our Western blot analysis showed increased levels of translocated β-catenin that stimulated the expression of target genes after HBO treatment. HBO increased TCF-dependent transcription, Runx2 promoter/Luc gene activity, and the expression of osteogenic markers of BMSCs, such as alkaline phosphatase activity, type I collagen, osteocalcin, calcium, and the intensity of Alizarin Red staining. HBO dose dependently increased the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP2) and osterix production. We further demonstrated that HBO increased the expression of vacuolar-ATPases, which stimulated Wnt3a secretion from BMSCs. Finally, we showed that the beneficial effects of HBO on bone formation were related to Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling in a rabbit model by histology, mechanical testing, and immunohistochemical assays. Accordingly, we concluded that HBO increased the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by regulating Wnt3a secretion and signaling.

Abstract: Germ cells are the only cell type that passes genetic information to the next generation. In most metazoan species, primordial germ cells (PGCs) were induced from epiblasts by signals from the neighboring tissues. In vitro derivation of germ cells from the pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced PSCs (iPSCs) are of great values for the treatment of infertility, for animal breeding, and for studying the mechanism of germ cell development. Although the derivations of male germ cells from PSCs have been previously reported, most of the studies failed to conduct the induction in a well-controlled and highly efficient manner. Here, we report the derivation of induced PGC-like cells (iPGCLCs) from mouse iPSCs via induced epiblast-like cells (iEpiLCs) as being monitored by the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein gene under the control of the promoter of stimulated by retinoic acid 8 (Stra8-EGFP). The identity of iPGCLCs was characterized by examining the expression of multiple marker genes as well as by the recovery of spermatogenesis after they were transplanted to the testis of infertile W/Wv mice. Furthermore, iPGCLCs were either induced to germline stem cell-like cells (iGSCLCs) or reverted back to embryonic germ cell-like cells (iEGCLCs). In conclusion, we have established an efficient procedure for inducing iPSCs into iPGCLCs that can be further expanded and induced to more developed germ cells. This work indicates that the technology of in vitro germ cell induction is becoming more sophisticated and can be further improved.

Abstract: One of the applications of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) that are produced by ex vivo expansion is for use in in vivo bone tissue engineering. Cultured stromal cells are a mixture of cells at different stages of commitment and expansion capability, leading to a heterogeneous cell population that each time can differ in the potential to form in vivo bone. A parameter that predicts for in vivo bone forming capacity is thus far lacking. We employed single colony-derived BMSC cultures to identify such predictive parameters. Using limiting dilution, we have produced sixteen single CFU-F derived BMSC cultures from human bone marrow and found that only five of these formed bone in vivo. The single colony-derived BMSC strains were tested for proliferation, osteogenic-, adipogenic- and chondrogenic differentiation capacity and the expression of a variety of associated markers. The only robust predictors of in vivo bone forming capacity were the induction of alkaline phosphatase, (ALP) mRNA levels and ALP activity during in vitro osteogenic differentiation. The predictive value of in vitro ALP induction was confirmed by analyzing “bulk-cultured” BMSCs from various bone marrow biopsies. Our findings show that in BMSCs, the additional increase in ALP levels over basal levels during in vitro osteogenic differentiation is predictive of in vivo performance.

Abstract: Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASC) form a rich source of autologous cells for use in regenerative medicine. In vitro induction of an endothelial phenotype may improve performance of ASCs in cardiovascular repair. Here, we report on an in vitro strategy using direct reprogramming of ASCs by means of ectopic expression of the endothelial-specific transcription factor SRY (sex determining region Y)-box18 (SOX18). SOX18 induces ASCs to express a set of genes involved in vascular patterning: MMP7, KDR, EFNB2, SEMA3G and CXCR4. Accordingly, SOX18 transduced ASCs reorganize under conditions of shear stress, display VEGF-induced chemotaxis and form tubular structures in 3D matrices in an MMP7-dependent manner. These in vitro findings provide insight into molecular and cellular processes downstream of SOX18 and show that reprogramming using SOX18 is sufficient to induce several endothelial-like features in ASCs.

Abstract: Human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived “mesenchymal stem cells”) can establish the hematopoietic microenvironment within heterotopic ossicles generated by transplantation at non-skeletal sites. Here we show that non-mineralized cartilage pellets formed by hBMSCs ex vivo generate complete ossicles upon heterotopic transplantation in the absence of exogenous scaffolds. These ossicles display a remarkable degree of architectural fidelity, showing that an exogenous conductive scaffold is not an absolute requirement for bone formation by transplanted BMSCs. Marrow cavities within the ossicles include erythroid, myeloid and granulopoietic lineages, clonogenic hematopoietic progenitors and phenotypic HSCs, indicating that complete stem cell niches and hematopoiesis are established. hBMSCs (CD146+ adventitial reticular cells) are established in the heterotopic chimeric bone marrow through a unique process of endochondral bone marrow formation, distinct from physiological endochondral bone formation. In this process, chondrocytes remain viable and proliferate within the pellet, are released from cartilage, and convert into bone marrow stromal cells. Once explanted in secondary culture, these cells retain phenotype and properties of skeletal stem cells (“MSCs”), including the ability to form secondary cartilage pellets and secondary ossicles upon serial transplantation. Ex vivo, hBMSCs initially induced to form cartilage pellets can be reestablished in adherent culture and can modulate gene expression between cartilage and stromal cell phenotypes. These data show that so-called “cartilage differentiation” of BMSCs in vitro is a reversible phenomenon, which is actually reverted, in vivo, to the effect of generating stromal cells supporting the homing of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors.

Abstract: The shortage of molecular information on cell cycle changes along embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation prompts an in silico approach, which may provide a novel way to identify candidate genes or mechanisms acting in coordinating the two programs. We analyzed germ layer specific gene expression changes during the cell cycle and ESC differentiation by combining four human cell cycle transcriptome profiles with thirteen in vitro human ESC differentiation studies. To detect cross-talk mechanisms we then integrated the transcriptome data that displayed differential regulation with protein interaction data. A new class of non-transcriptionally regulated genes was identified, encoding proteins which interact systematically with proteins corresponding to genes regulated during the cell cycle or cell differentiation, and which therefore can be seen as interface proteins coordinating the two programs. Functional analysis gathered insights in fate-specific candidates of interface functionalities. The non-transcriptionally regulated interface proteins were found to be highly regulated by post-translational ubiquitylation modification, which may synchronize the transition between cell proliferation and differentiation in ESCs.

HtrA2/Omi influences the stability of LON protease 1 and prohibitin, proteins involved in mitochondrial homeostasis,

Abstract: High temperature requirement A2 (HtrA2)/Omi is a serine protease localized in mitochondria. In response to apoptotic stimuli, HtrA2 is released to the cytoplasm and cleaves many proteins, including XIAP, Apollon/BRUCE, WT1, and Ped/Pea-15, to promote apoptosis. However, the function of HtrA2 in mitochondria under normal conditions remains unclear. Here, we show that the mitochondrial proteins, LON protease 1 (LONP1) and prohibitin (PHB), are overexpressed in HtrA2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and HtrA2 knock-down HEK293T cells. We also confirm the effect of the HtrA2 protease on the stability of the above mitochondrial quality control proteins in motor neuron degeneration 2 (mnd2) mice, which have a greatly reduced protease activity as a result of a Ser276Cys missense mutation of the HtrA2 gene. In addition, PHB interacts with and is directly cleaved by HtrA2. Luminescence assays demonstrate that the intracellular ATP level is decreased in HtrA2−/− cells compared to HtrA2+/+ cells. HtrA2 deficiency causes a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is greater in HtrA2−/− cells than in HtrA2+/+ cells. Our results implicate that HtrA2 might be an upstream regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were used as a model system of human pancreas development to study characteristics of the polyhormonal cells that arise during fetal pancreas development. HESCs were differentiated into fetal-like pancreatic cells in vitro using a 33-day, 7-stage protocol. Cultures were ~90–95% PDX1-positive by day (d) 11 and 70–75% NKX6.1-positive by d17. Polyhormonal cells were scattered at d17, but developed into islet-like clusters that expressed key transcription factors by d33. Human C-peptide and glucagon secretion were first detected at d17 and increased thereafter in parallel with INS and GCG transcript levels. HESC-derived cells were responsive to KCl and arginine, but not glucose in perifusion studies. Compared to adult human islets, hESC-derived cells expressed ~10-fold higher levels of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) mRNA, but similar levels of glucokinase (GCK). In situ hybridization confirmed the presence of GLUT1 transcript within endocrine cells. However, GLUT1 protein was excluded from this population and was instead observed predominantly in non-endocrine cells, whereas GCK was co-expressed in insulin-positive cells. In rubidium efflux assays, hESC-derived cells displayed mild potassium channel activity, but no responsiveness to glucose, metabolic inhibitors or glibenclamide. Western blotting experiments revealed that the higher molecular weight SUR1 band was absent in hESC-derived cells, suggesting a lack of functional KATP channels at the cell surface. In addition, KATP channel subunit transcript levels were not at a 1:1 ratio, as would be expected (SUR1 levels were ~5-fold lower than KIR6.2). Various ratios of SUR1:KIR6.2 plasmids were transfected into COSM6 cells and rubidium efflux was found to be particularly sensitive to a reduction in SUR1. These data suggest that an impaired ratio of SUR1:KIR6.2 may contribute to the observed KATP channel defects in hESC-derived islet endocrine cells, and along with lack of GLUT1, may explain the absence of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic engineering of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) via customized designer nucleases has been shown to be significantly more efficient than conventional gene targeting, but still typically depends on the introduction of additional genetic selection elements. In our study, we demonstrate the efficient nonviral and selection-independent gene targeting in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Our high efficiencies of up to 1.6% of gene-targeted hiPSCs, accompanied by a low background of randomly inserted transgenes, eliminated the need for antibiotic or fluorescence-activated cell sorting selection, and allowed the use of short donor oligonucleotides for footprintless gene editing. Gene-targeted hiPSC clones were established simply by direct PCR screening. This optimized approach allows targeted transgene integration into safe harbor sites for more predictable and robust expression and enables the straightforward generation of disease-corrected, patient-derived iPSC lines for research purposes and, ultimately, for future clinical applications.

Abstract: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor and environmental sensor that regulates expression of genes involved in drug-metabolism and cell cycle regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, Ahr ablation in mice and studies with orthologous genes in invertebrates suggest that AHR may also play a significant role in embryonic development. To address this hypothesis, we studied the regulation of Ahr expression in mouse embryonic stem cells and their differentiated progeny. In ES cells, interactions between OCT3/4, NANOG, SOX2 and Polycomb Group proteins at the Ahr promoter repress AHR expression, which can also be repressed by ectopic expression of reprogramming factors in hepatoma cells. In ES cells, unproductive RNA polymerase II binds at the Ahr transcription start site and drives the synthesis of short abortive transcripts. Activation of Ahr expression during differentiation follows from reversal of repressive marks in Ahr promoter chromatin, release of pluripotency factors and PcG proteins, binding of Sp factors, establishment of histone marks of open chromatin, and engagement of active RNAPII to drive full-length RNA transcript elongation. Our results suggest that reversible Ahr repression in ES cells holds the gene poised for expression and allows for a quick switch to activation during embryonic development.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are the most diverse but also the most poorly known family of molecular chaperones, and they play essential roles in various biological processes. The striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is one of the most serious pests of rice, causing extensive damage and yield loss. In this study, we isolated and characterized five members of the sHSPs family—Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.4, Cshsp21.5, Cshsp21.7a, and Cshsp21.7b—from C. suppressalis. The cDNAs of these genes encoded proteins of 177, 187, 191, 191, and 191 amino acids with isoelectric points of 7.0, 5.6, 6.1, 6.3, and 6.3, respectively. While Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.5, and Cshsp21.7b had no introns, Cshsp21.4 and Cshsp21.7a contained one and two introns, respectively. Structural analysis indicated that all five Cshsps possessed conserved arginine and a V/IXI/V motif, which is related to hydrophobic characteristics of sHSPs. The five heat shock proteins can be classified into two main groups: an orthologous type (Cshsp21.4 and Cshsp21.7a) and a species-specific type (Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.5, and Cshsp21.7b). Real-time quantitative PCR analyses revealed that Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.5, Cshsp21.7a, and Cshsp21.7b all exhibited their highest expression levels within Malpighian tubules or the hindgut, while such levels were found in the head for Cshsp21.4. The expression of Csshsps at different developmental stages revealed that the mRNA levels of Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.4, Cshsp21.5, and Cshsp21.7b peaked in adults, whereas the highest level of Cshsp21.7a was observed in first instar larvae. Cshsp19.8 and Cshsp21.7b were both upregulated dramatically by heat and cold, and Cshsp21.5 could be induced by cold stress. Neither Cshsp21.4 nor Cshsp21.7a responded to heat or cold. These results demonstrated that different Csshsps play distinctive roles in the regulation of the physiological activities in C. suppressalis.

Abstract: Summary
Because of their immunomodulatory properties, human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) represent promising stem cells for treatment of immune disorders. hBMSCs expansion precedes their clinical use, so the possibility that hBMSCs undergo spontaneous transformation upon long-term culture should be addressed. Whether hBMSCs retain immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties upon oncogenic transformation remains unknown. Using sequentially mutated hBMSCs and spontaneously transformed hBMSCs, we report that, upon oncogenic transformation, hBMSCs lose immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptome profiling and functional assays reveal immune effectors underlying the loss of immunomodulation in transformed hBMSCs. They display a proinflammatory transcriptomic signature, with deregulation of immune and inflammatory modulators and regulators of the prostaglandin synthesis. Transformed hBMSCs lose their capacity to secrete the immunosuppressive prostacyclins prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGI2 but produce proinflammatory thromboxanes. Together, the immunoregulatory profile adopted by hBMSCs largely depends on intrinsic genetic-molecular determinants triggered by genomic instability/oncogenic transformation.

Abstract: Summary
miR-133a and miR-1 are known as muscle-specific microRNAs that are involved in cardiac development and pathophysiology. We have shown that both miR-1 and miR-133a are early and progressively upregulated during in vitro cardiac differentiation of adult cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), but only miR-133a expression was enhanced under in vitro oxidative stress. miR-1 was demonstrated to favor differentiation of CPCs, whereas miR-133a overexpression protected CPCs against cell death, targeting, among others, the proapoptotic genes Bim and Bmf. miR-133a-CPCs clearly improved cardiac function in a rat myocardial infarction model by reducing fibrosis and hypertrophy and increasing vascularization and cardiomyocyte proliferation. The beneficial effects of miR-133a-CPCs seem to correlate with the upregulated expression of several relevant paracrine factors and the plausible cooperative secretion of miR-133a via exosomal transport. Finally, an in vitro heart muscle model confirmed the antiapoptotic effects of miR-133a-CPCs, favoring the structuration and contractile functionality of the artificial tissue.

Abstract: Semaphorins and their receptors plexins are implicated in various processes in the nervous system, but how B-plexins regulate the growth of dendrites remains poorly characterized. We had previously observed that Plexin-B1 and B3 interact with microtubule end-binding proteins (EBs) that are central adapters at growing microtubule tips, and this interaction is involved in neurite growth. Therefore, we hypothesized that plexins regulate microtubule dynamics and through that also dendritogenesis. The role of all three B-plexins was systematically examined in these processes. B-plexins and their ligand Semaphorin-4D influence the dynamics of microtubule tips both EB-dependently and independendently. EB3 as well as Plexin-B1, B2 and B3 turned out to have a significant role in the development of dendritic arbor of rat hippocampal neurons. Our results clearly indicate that semaphorin-plexin-EB pathway is one molecular mechanism how extracellular guidance cues are translated into intracellular mechanics. Taken together, Semaphorin-4D and B-plexins modulate the dynamic behavior of microtubule tips, and are therefore important in neurite growth.

Abstract: Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are well known initiators of hepatic fibrosis. After liver cell damage, HSC transdifferentiate into proliferative myofibroblasts, representing the major source of extracellular matrix in the fibrotic organ. Recent studies also demonstrate a role of HSC as progenitor or stem cell like cells in liver regeneration. Lhx2 is described as stem cell maintaining factor in different organs and as an inhibitory transcription factor in HSC activation. Here we examined whether a continuous expression of Lhx2 in HSC could attenuate their activation and whether Lhx2 could serve as a potential target for antifibrotic gene therapy. Therefore, we evaluated an adenoviral mediated overexpression of Lhx2 in primary HSC and investigated mRNA expression patterns by qRT-PCR as well as the activation status by different in vitro assays. HSC revealed a marked increase in activation markers like smooth muscle actin alpha (αSMA) and collagen 1α independent from adenoviral transduction. Lhx2 overexpression resulted in attenuated cell viability as shown by a slightly hampered migratory and contractile phenotype of HSC. Expression of stem cell factors or signaling components was also unaffected by Lhx2. Summarizing these results, we found no antifibrotic or stem cell maintaining effect of Lhx2 overexpression in primary HSC.

Abstract: Angiogenesis is an essential neovascularisation process, which if recapitulated in 3D in vitro, will provide better understanding of endothelial cell (EC) behaviour. Various cell types and growth factors are involved, with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 key components. We were able to control the aggregation pattern of ECs in 3D collagen hydrogels, by varying the matrix composition and/or having a source of cells signalling angiogenic proteins. These aggregation patterns reflect the different developmental pathways that ECs take to form different sized tubular structures. Cultures with added laminin and thus increased expression of α6 integrin showed a significant increase (p<0.05) in VEGFR2 positive ECs and increased VEGF uptake. This resulted in the end-to-end network aggregation of ECs. In cultures without laminin and therefore low α6 integrin expression, VEGFR2 levels and VEGF uptake were significantly lower (p<0.05). These ECs formed contiguous sheets, analogous to the ‘wrapping’ pathway in development. We have identified a key linkage between integrin expression on ECs and their uptake of VEGF, regulated by VEGFR2, resulting in different aggregation patterns in 3D.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer unique opportunities for developing novel cell-based therapies and disease modeling. In this study, we developed a directed differentiation method for hiPSCs toward corneal epithelial progenitor cells capable of terminal differentiation toward mature corneal epithelial-like cells. In order to improve the efficiency and reproducibility of our method, we replicated signaling cues active during ocular surface ectoderm development with the help of two small-molecule inhibitors in combination with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in serum-free and feeder-free conditions. First, small-molecule induction downregulated the expression of pluripotency markers while upregulating several transcription factors essential for normal eye development. Second, protein expression of the corneal epithelial progenitor marker p63 was greatly enhanced, with up to 95% of cells being p63 positive after 5 weeks of differentiation. Third, corneal epithelial-like cells were obtained upon further maturation.
