Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells possess lifelong self-renewal activity and generate multipotent progenitors that differentiate into lineage-committed and subsequently mature cells. We present a comparative transcriptome analysis of ex vivo isolated mouse multipotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (LinnegSCA-1+c-KIT+) and myeloid committed precursors (LinnegSCA-1negc-KIT+). Our data display dynamic transcriptional networks and identify a stem/progenitor gene expression pattern that is characterized by cell adhesion and immune response components including kallikrein-related proteases. We identify 498 expressed lncRNAs, which are potential regulators of multipotency or lineage commitment. By integrating these transcriptome with our recently reported proteome data, we found evidence for posttranscriptional regulation of processes including metabolism and response to oxidative stress. Finally, our study identifies a high number of genes with transcript isoform regulation upon lineage commitment. This in-depth molecular analysis outlines the enormous complexity of expressed coding and noncoding RNAs and posttranscriptional regulation during the early differentiation steps of hematopoietic stem cells toward the myeloid lineage.

Abstract: We recently showed that astaxanthin (ASX), a xanthophyll carotenoid, activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway of insulin signaling and improves glucose metabolism in liver of high fructose–fat diet (HFFD)-fed mice. The aim of this study is to investigate whether ASX influences phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and inflammation in liver of HFFD-fed mice. Adult male Mus musculus mice were fed either with control diet or HFFD for 15 days. After this period, mice in each group were divided into two and administered ASX (2 mg/kg/day, p.o) in 0.3 ml olive oil or 0.3 ml olive oil alone for the next 45 days. At the end of 60 days, liver tissue was excised and examined for lipid accumulation (Oil red O staining), intracellular ROS production, ER stress, and inflammatory markers. Elevated ROS production, lipid accumulation, and increased hepatic expression of ER stress markers such as Ig-binding protein, PKR-like ER kinase, phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, X-box binding protein 1, activating transcription factor 6, and the apoptotic marker caspase 12 were observed in the liver of the HFFD group. ASX significantly reversed these changes. This reduction was accompanied by reduced activation of JNK1 and I kappa B kinase β phosphorylation and nuclear factor-kappa B p65 nuclear translocation in ASX-treated HFFD mice. These findings suggest that alleviation of inflammation and ER stress by ASX could be a mechanism responsible for its beneficial effect in this model. ASX could be a promising treatment strategy for insulin resistant patients.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal degenerative diseases resulting in the loss of photoreceptors are one of the major causes of blindness. Photoreceptor replacement therapy is a promising treatment because the transplantation of retina-derived photoreceptors can be applied now to different murine retinopathies to restore visual function. To have an unlimited source of photoreceptors, we derived a transgenic embryonic stem cell (ESC) line in which the Crx-GFP transgene is expressed in photoreceptors and assessed the capacity of a 3D culture protocol to produce integration-competent photoreceptors. This culture system allows the production of a large number of photoreceptors recapitulating the in vivo development. After transplantation, integrated cells showed the typical morphology of mature rods bearing external segments and ribbon synapses. We conclude that a 3D protocol coupled with ESCs provides a safe and renewable source of photoreceptors displaying a development and transplantation competence comparable to photoreceptors from age-matched retinas.

Abstract: We previously demonstrated the capacity of GAS1 (Growth Arrest Specific 1) to inhibit the growth of gliomas by blocking the GDNF–RET signaling pathway. Here, we show that a soluble form of GAS1 (tGAS1), decreases the number of viable MDA MB 231 human breast cancer cells, acting in both autocrine and paracrine manners when secreted from producing cells. Moreover, tGAS1 inhibits the growth of tumors implanted in female nu/nu mice through a RET-independent mechanism which involves interfering with the Artemin (ARTN)-GFRα3-(GDNF Family Receptor alpha 3) mediated intracellular signaling and the activation of ERK. In addition, we observed that the presence of tGAS1 reduces the vascularization of implanted tumors, by preventing the migration of endothelial cells. The present results support a potential adjuvant role for tGAS1 in the treatment of breast cancer, by detaining tumor growth and inhibiting angiogenesis.

Abstract: Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have two potentially attractive applications: cell replacement-based therapies and drug discovery. Both require the efficient generation of large quantities of clinical-grade stem cells that are free from harmful genomic alterations. The currently employed colony-type culture methods often result in low cell yields, unavoidably heterogeneous cell populations, and substantial chromosomal abnormalities. Here, we shed light on the structural relationship between hPSC colonies/embryoid bodies and early-stage embryos in order to optimize current culture methods based on the insights from developmental biology. We further highlight core signaling pathways that underlie multiple epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), cellular heterogeneity, and chromosomal instability in hPSCs. We also analyze emerging methods such as non-colony type monolayer (NCM) and suspension culture, which provide alternative growth models for hPSC expansion and differentiation. Furthermore, based on the influence of cell–cell interactions and signaling pathways, we propose concepts, strategies, and solutions for production of clinical-grade hPSCs, stem cell precursors, and miniorganoids, which are pivotal steps needed for future clinical applications.

Abstract: Most previous studies have linked cancer–macrophage fusion with tumor progression and metastasis. However, the characteristics of hybrid cells derived from oral cancer and endothelial cells and their involvement in cancer remained unknown. Double-immunofluorescent staining and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed to confirm spontaneous cell fusion between eGFP-labeled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and RFP-labeled SCC9, and to detect the expression of vementin and cytokeratin 18 in the hybrids. The property of chemo-resistance of such hybrids was examined by TUNEL assay. The hybrid cells in xenografted tumor were identified by FISH and GFP/RFP dual-immunofluoresence staining. We showed that SCC9 cells spontaneously fused with cocultured endothelial cells, and the resultant hybrid cells maintained the division and proliferation activity after re-plating and thawing. Such hybrids expressed markers of both parental cells and became more resistant to chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin as compared to the parental SCC9 cells. Our in vivo data indicated that the hybrid cells contributed to tumor composition by using of immunostaining and FISH analysis, even though the hybrid cells and SCC9 cells were mixed with 1:10,000, according to the FACS data. Our study suggested that the fusion events between oral cancer and endothelial cells undergo nuclear fusion and acquire a new property of drug resistance and consequently enhanced survival potential. These experimental findings provide further supportive evidence for the theory that cell fusion is involved in cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
The accelerated cell death 11 (acd11) mutant of Arabidopsis provides a genetic model for studying immune response activation and localized cellular suicide that halt pathogen spread during infection in plants. Here, we elucidate ACD11 structure and function and show that acd11 disruption dramatically alters the in vivo balance of sphingolipid mediators that regulate eukaryotic-programmed cell death. In acd11 mutants, normally low ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) levels become elevated, but the relatively abundant cell death inducer phytoceramide rises acutely. ACD11 exhibits selective intermembrane transfer of C1P and phyto-C1P. Crystal structures establish C1P binding via a surface-localized, phosphate headgroup recognition center connected to an interior hydrophobic pocket that adaptively ensheaths lipid chains via a cleft-like gating mechanism. Point mutation mapping confirms functional involvement of binding site residues. A π helix (π bulge) near the lipid binding cleft distinguishes apo-ACD11 from other GLTP folds. The global two-layer, α-helically dominated, “sandwich” topology displaying C1P-selective binding identifies ACD11 as the plant prototype of a GLTP fold subfamily.

Abstract: Summary
Infection of macaques with chimeric viruses based on SIVMAC but expressing the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoproteins (SHIVs) remains the most powerful model for evaluating prevention and therapeutic strategies against AIDS. Unfortunately, only a few SHIVs are currently available. Furthermore, their generation has required extensive adaptation of the HIV-1 Env sequences in macaques so they may not accurately represent HIV-1 Env proteins circulating in humans, potentially limiting their translational utility. We developed a strategy for generating large numbers of SHIV constructs expressing Env proteins from newly transmitted HIV-1 strains. By inoculating macaques with cocktails of multiple SHIV variants, we selected SHIVs that can replicate and cause AIDS-like disease in immunologically intact rhesus macaques without requiring animal-to-animal passage. One of these SHIVs could be transmitted mucosally. We demonstrate the utility of the SHIVs generated by this method for evaluating neutralizing antibody administration as a protection against mucosal SHIV challenge.

Abstract: Adherent cells interact with extracellular matrix via cell–substrate contacts at focal adhesions. The dynamic assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions enables cell attachment, migration and growth. While the influence of mechanical forces on the formation and growth of focal adhesions has been widely observed, the force loading on specific proteins at focal adhesion complex is not clear. By co-expressing force sensitive α-actinin FRET probes and fluorescence labeled paxillin in MDCK cells, we have simultaneously observed the time-dependent changes in tension in α-actinin and the dynamics of focal adhesion during cell migration. We show that increase in tension in α-actinin at the focal adhesion coincides with elongation of the adhesion in its growth phase. The enlargement of focal adhesion is through a force sensitive recruitment of α-actinin and paxillin to the adhesion sites. Changes in α-actinin tension and correlated relocation of α-actinin in an active adhesion also guide the growth direction of the adhesion. The results support the model that cytoskeletal tension is coupled to focal adhesion via the linking protein, α-actinin at the adhesion complex. Lysophosphatidic acid caused an immediate increase in α-actinin tension followed by drastic focal adhesion formation and elongation. Application of Rho-ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, resulted in reversible reduction in tension in α-actinin and disassociation of focal adhesion, suggesting the involvement of myosin-II mediated contractile force in the focal adhesion dynamics. These findings suggest that α-actinin not only serves as a physical linker between cytoskeleton and integrin, but also participates in force transmission at adhesion sites to facilitate adhesion׳s growth.

Abstract: Methyl farnesoate (MF), an analogue of the insect juvenile hormone III, is believed to play important roles in the regulation of the growth and reproductive development in crustaceans. Farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase (FAMeT) is the key enzyme in the juvenile hormone biosynthetic pathway, involved in the conversion of farnesoic acid (FA) to MF in the final step of MF synthesis. In this study, a FAMeT cDNA (named EcFAMeT) was cloned from the hemocytes of ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods. The full-length cDNA of EcFAMeT was 1,620 bp, including contains a 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of 75 bp, 3′-UTR of 714 bp with a poly (A) tail, an open reading frame (ORF) of 831 bp, encoding a 276-amino-acid polypeptide with the predicted molecular weight of 31.57 kDa and estimated isoelectric point of 4.67. BLAST analysis revealed that amino acids of EcFAMeT shared high identity (75–90 %) with that of other crustaceans. Two conserved signatures domains of Methyltransf-FA superfamily were also identified in EcFAMeT. Real time quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that EcFAMeT could be detected in all the tested tissues and strongly expressed in hepatopancreas and ovary of E. carinicauda. After Vibrio anguillarum and WSSV challenge, EcFAMeT transcripts both in hemocytes and hepatopancreas increased significantly in the first 3 h, respectively. The results indicated that EcFAMeT might be associated with the immune defenses to V. anguillarum and WSSV in E. carinicauda.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the distribution of argyrophil, argentaffin, and insulin-immunoreactive endocrine cells in the large intestine of opossums (Didelphis aurita) and to describe the ultrastructure of the secretory granules of insulin-immunoreactive endocrine cells. Fragments of the large intestine of 10 male specimens of D. aurita were collected, processed, and subjected to staining, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. The argyrophil, the argentaffin, and the insulin-immunoreactive endocrine cells were sparsely distributed in the intestinal glands of the mucous layer, among other cell types of the epithelium in all regions studied. Proportionally, the argyrophil, the argentaffin, and the insulin-immunoreactive endocrine cells represented 62.75%, 36.26%, and 0.99% of the total determined endocrine cells of the large intestine, respectively. Quantitatively, there was no difference between the argyrophil and the argentaffin endocrine cells, whereas insulin-immunoreactive endocrine cells were less numerous. The insulin-immunoreactive endocrine cells were elongated or pyramidal, with rounded nuclei of irregularly contoured, and large amounts of secretory granules distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The granules have different sizes and electron densities and are classified as immature and mature, with the mature granules in predominant form in the overall granular population. In general, the granule is shown with an external electron-lucent halo and electron-dense core. The ultrastructure pattern in the granules of the insulin-immunoreactive endocrine cells was similar to that of the B cells of pancreatic islets in rats.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is one of the most abundant and best characterized heat shock protein family that consists of highly conserved stress proteins, expressed in response to stress, and plays crucial roles in environmental stress tolerance and adaptation. The present study was conducted to identify major types of genes under the HSP70 family and to quantify their expression pattern in heat- and cold-adapted Indian goats (Capra hircus) with respect to different seasons. Five HSP70 gene homologues to HSPA8, HSPA6, HSPA1A, HSPA1L, and HSPA2 were identified by gene-specific primers. The cDNA sequences showed high similarity to other mammals, and proteins have an estimated molecular weight of around 70 kDa. The expression of HSP70 genes was observed during summer and winter. During summer, the higher expression of HSPA8, HSPA6, and HSPA1A was observed, whereas the expression levels of HSPA1L and HSPA2 were found to be lower. It was also observed that the expression of HSPA1A and HSPA8 was higher during winter in both heat- and cold-adapted goats but downregulates in case of other HSPs. Therefore, both heat and cold stress induced the overexpression of HSP70 genes. An interesting finding that emerged from the study is the higher expression of HSP70 genes in cold-adapted goats during summer and in heat-adapted goats during winter. Altogether, the results indicate that the expression pattern of HSP70 genes is species- and breed-specific, most likely due to variations in thermal tolerance and adaptation to different climatic conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Perturbations in stem cell activity and differentiation can lead to developmental defects and cancer. We use an approach involving a quantitative model of cell-state transitions in vitro to gain insights into how SLUG/SNAI2, a key developmental transcription factor, modulates mammary epithelial stem cell activity and differentiation in vivo. In the absence of SLUG, stem cells fail to transition into basal progenitor cells, while existing basal progenitor cells undergo luminal differentiation; together, these changes result in abnormal mammary architecture and defects in tissue function. Furthermore, we show that in the absence of SLUG, mammary stem cell activity necessary for tissue regeneration and cancer initiation is lost. Mechanistically, SLUG regulates differentiation and cellular plasticity by recruiting the chromatin modifier lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) to promoters of lineage-specific genes to repress transcription. Together, these results demonstrate that SLUG plays a dual role in repressing luminal epithelial differentiation while unlocking stem cell transitions necessary for tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The adult newt brain has a marked neurogenic potential and is highly regenerative. Ventricular, radial glia-like ependymoglia cells give rise to neurons both during normal homeostasis and after injury, but subpopulations among ependymoglia cells have not been defined. We show here that a substantial portion of GFAP+ ependymoglia cells in the proliferative hot spots of the telencephalon has transit-amplifying characteristics. In contrast, proliferating ependymoglia cells, which are scattered along the ventricular wall, have stem cell features in terms of label retention and insensitivity to AraC treatment. Ablation of neurons remodels the proliferation dynamics and leads to de novo formation of regions displaying features of neurogenic niches, such as the appearance of cells with transit-amplifying features and proliferating neuroblasts. The results have implication both for our understanding of the evolutionary diversification of radial glia cells as well as the processes regulating neurogenesis and regeneration in the adult vertebrate brain.

Abstract: Summary
Cbx4 is a polycomb group protein that is also a SUMO E3 ligase, but its potential roles in tumorigenesis remain to be explored. Here, we report that Cbx4, but not other members of the Cbx family, enhances hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells through enhancing HIF-1α sumoylations at K391 and K477 in its two SUMO-interacting motifs-dependent mechanisms and increasing transcriptional activity of HIF-1. The Cbx4 expression is significantly correlated with VEGF expression, angiogenesis, and the overall survival of HCC patients and also in subcutaneously and orthotopically transplanted mice HCC models. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that Cbx4 plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis by governing HIF-1α protein.

Abstract: The androgen receptor (AR) plays critical roles in human prostate carcinoma progression and transformation. However, the activation of AR is regulated by co-regulators. MEIS1 protein, the homeodomain transcription factor, exhibited a decreased level in poor-prognosis prostate tumors. In this study, we investigated a potential interaction between MEIS1 and AR. We found that overexpression of MEIS1 inhibited the AR transcriptional activity and reduced the expression of AR target gene. A potential protein–protein interaction between AR and MEIS1 was identified by the immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Furthermore, MEIS1 modulated AR cytoplasm/nucleus translocation and the recruitment to androgen response element in prostate specific antigen (PSA) gene promoter sequences. In addition, MEIS1 promoted the recruitment of NCoR and SMRT in the presence of R1881. Finally, MEIS1 inhibited the proliferation and anchor-independent growth of LNCaP cells. Taken together, our data suggests that MEIS1 functions as a novel AR co-repressor.

Abstract: Recent evidences indicated Nrf2 is more potent than Nrf1 in the activation of antioxidant genes. However, the roles of Nrf proteins in the regulation of copper-responsive transcription have not been well addressed. We took the toxicogenomic approach and the present network and Gene Ontology analyses results showed that Nrf1 and Nrf2 are distinctively involved in copper-responsive transcriptional regulation in HepG2 transcriptome. Cells deficient in either Nrf1 or Nrf2 were more susceptible to copper exposure than wild type cells. Nrf1 and Nrf2 null cells were transfected with the luciferase reporters containing either ARE(s) or a combination of ARE(s) and MREs, and then treated with copper. In Nrf2-null (Nrf2−/−) cells, copper did not activate transcription of reporter genes, whereas Nrf1 deficiency did not affect copper-inducible activation. Ectopic expression of Nrf2 restored copper-inducible transcription in Nrf2−/− cells. However, the changes in the intrinsic mRNA levels of MT-1 in Nrf null cells following copper treatment showed that Nrf1 and Nrf2 equally contributed to MT-1 activation after 4h, while Nrf1involved more than Nrf2 following 24h exposure. These results suggest that while Nrf2 is crucial for MRE/ARE-mediated transcription in response to copper, Nrf1 may activate MT-1 expression by a mechanism different from that Nrf2 employs.

Abstract: Lutheran (Lu), an immunoglobulin superfamily transmembrane receptor, is also known as basal cell adhesion molecule (B-CAM). Lu/B-CAM is a specific receptor for laminin α5, a subunit of laminin-511 (LM-511) that is a major component of basement membranes in various tissues. Our previous study showed that Lu/B-CAM was cleaved by MT1-MMP and released from cell surfaces. In this study we examined the soluble Lu/B-CAM in culture media and in plasma of mice bearing HuH-7 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and patients with HCC. Two HCC cell lines, HepG2 and HuH-7, released Lu/B-CAM into the culture media. Although Lu/B-CAM was cleaved by MT1-MMP in HuH-7 cells, HepG2 cells released Lu/B-CAM in a MMP-independent manner. The concentration of Lu/B-CAM released into mouse plasma correlated with tumor size. Moreover the soluble Lu/B-CAM in plasma of HCC patients was significantly decreased after resection of the tumor. Immunohistochemical studies showed that although the expression of Lu/B-CAM was observed in most HCCs, MT1-MMP was not always expressed in tumor tissues, suggesting that a part of Lu/B-CAM in plasma of HCC patients was also released in a MMP-independent manner. In vitro studies showed that the soluble Lu/B-CAM released from HCC cells bound to LM-511. Moreover the soluble Lu/B-CAM influenced cell migration on LM-511. These results suggest that soluble Lu/B-CAM serves as not only a novel marker for HCC but also a modulator in tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Following contact with the epithelium, the enteric intracellular bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri invades epithelial cells and escapes intracellular phagosomal destruction using its type III secretion system (T3SS). The bacterium replicates within the host cell cytosol and spreads between cells using actin-based motility, which is mediated by the virulence factor IcsA (VirG). Whereas S. flexneri invasion is well characterized, adhesion mechanisms of the bacterium remain elusive. We found that IcsA also functions as an adhesin that is both necessary and sufficient to promote contact with host cells. As adhesion can be beneficial or deleterious depending on the host cell type, S. flexneri regulates IcsA-dependent adhesion. Activation of the T3SS in response to the bile salt deoxycholate triggers IcsA-dependent adhesion and enhances pathogen invasion. IcsA-dependent adhesion contributes to virulence in a mouse model of shigellosis, underscoring the importance of this adhesin to S. flexneri pathogenesis.

Roles of mitochondrial fragmentation and reactive oxygen species in mitochondrial dysfunction and myocardial insulin resistance,

Abstract: Purpose
Evidence suggests an association between aberrant mitochondrial dynamics and cardiac diseases. Because myocardial metabolic deficiency caused by insulin resistance plays a crucial role in heart disease, we investigated the role of dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP1; a mitochondrial fission protein) in the pathogenesis of myocardial insulin resistance.
Methods and Results
DRP1-expressing H9c2 myocytes, which had fragmented mitochondria with mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) depolarization, exhibited attenuated insulin signaling and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) uptake, indicating insulin resistance. Treatment of the DRP1-expressing myocytes with Mn(III)tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin pentachloride (TMPyP) significantly improved insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction. When myocytes were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), they increased DRP1 expression and mitochondrial fragmentation, resulting in ΔΨm depolarization and insulin resistance. When DRP1 was suppressed by siRNA, H2O2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance were restored. Our results suggest that a mutual enhancement between DRP1 and reactive oxygen species could induce mitochondrial dysfunction and myocardial insulin resistance. In palmitate-induced insulin-resistant myocytes, neither DRP1-suppression nor TMPyP restored the ΔΨm depolarization and impaired 2-DG uptake, however they improved insulin signaling.
Conclusions
A mutual enhancement between DRP1 and ROS could promote mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibition of insulin signal transduction. However, other mechanisms, including lipid metabolite-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, may be involved in palmitate-induced insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanoelectrical transduction (MeT) channels embedded in neuronal cell membranes are essential for touch and proprioception. Little is understood about the interplay between native MeT channels and membrane phospholipids, in part because few techniques are available for altering plasma membrane composition in vivo. Here, we leverage genetic dissection, chemical complementation, and optogenetics to establish that arachidonic acid (AA), an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, enhances touch sensation and mechanoelectrical transduction activity while incorporated into membrane phospholipids in C. elegans touch receptor neurons (TRNs). Because dynamic force spectroscopy reveals that AA modulates the mechanical properties of TRN plasma membranes, we propose that this polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) is needed for MeT channel activity. These findings establish that polyunsaturated phospholipids are crucial determinants of both the biochemistry and mechanics of mechanoreceptor neurons and reinforce the idea that sensory mechanotransduction in animals relies on a cellular machine composed of both proteins and membrane lipids.

Abstract: Hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1) is caused by deficiency in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), an enzyme that catalyzes the last step of tyrosine metabolism. The most severe form of the disease presents acutely during infancy, and is characterized by severe liver involvement, most commonly resulting in death if untreated. Generation of FAH+/− pigs was previously accomplished by adeno-associated virus-mediated gene knockout in fibroblasts and somatic cell nuclear transfer. Subsequently, these animals were outbred and crossed to produce the first FAH−/− pigs. FAH-deficiency produced a lethal defect in utero that was corrected by administration of 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3 cyclohexanedione (NTBC) throughout pregnancy. Animals on NTBC were phenotypically normal at birth; however, the animals were euthanized approximately four weeks after withdrawal of NTBC due to clinical decline and physical examination findings of severe liver injury and encephalopathy consistent with acute liver failure. Biochemical and histological analyses, characterized by diffuse and severe hepatocellular damage, confirmed the diagnosis of severe liver injury. FAH−/− pigs provide the first genetically engineered large animal model of a metabolic liver disorder. Future applications of FAH−/− pigs include discovery research as a large animal model of HT1 and spontaneous acute liver failure, and preclinical testing of the efficacy of liver cell therapies, including transplantation of hepatocytes, liver stem cells, and pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes.

Abstract: One goal of research using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) is to generate patient-specific cells which can be used to obtain multiple types of differentiated cells as disease models. Minimally or non-integrating methods to deliver the reprogramming genes are considered to be the best but they may be inefficient. Lentiviral delivery is currently among the most efficient methods but it integrates transgenes into the genome, which may affect the behavior of the iPSC if integration occurs into an important locus. Here we designed a polycistronic lentiviral construct containing four pluripotency genes with an EGFP selection marker. The cassette was excisable with the Cre-loxP system making possible the removal of the integrated transgenes from the genome. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were reprogrammed using this viral system, rapidly resulting in large number of iPSC colonies. Based on the lowest EGFP expression level, one parental line was chosen for excision. Introduction of the Cre recombinase resulted in transgene-free iPSC subclones. The effect of the transgenes was assessed by comparing the parental iPSC with two of its transgene-free subclones. Both excised and non-excised iPSCs expressed standard pluripotency markers. The subclones obtained after Cre recombination were capable of differentiation in vitro, in contrast to the parental, non-excised cells and formed germ-line competent chimeras in vivo.

Abstract: Both BMP and Wnt signaling control stem cells in bulge/dermal papilla, intestinal crypt, and bone marrow. To explore their roles in the limbal niche, which govern corneal epithelial homeostasis, we established an in vitro model of sphere growth by reunion between single limbal epithelial progenitor cells (LEPCs) and aggregates of limbal niche cells (LNCs) in 3D Matrigel. Compared to LEPCs alone, spheres formed by LEPC+LNC exhibited higher clonal growth and less corneal epithelial differentiation. Furthermore, pSmad1/5/8 was in the nucleus of LEPCs, but not LNCs, and correlated with upregulation of BMP1, BMP3, BMP4, all three BMP receptors, and BMP target genes. Inactivation of BMP signaling in LNCs was correlated with upregulation of noggin preferentially expressed by LNCs. Additionally, β-catenin was stabilized in the perinuclear cytoplasm in LEPCs and correlated with upregulation of Wnt7A and FZD5 preferentially expressed by LEPCs. Inactivation of Wnt signaling in LNCs was correlated with upregulation of DKK1/2 by LNCs. Addition of XAV939 that expectedly downregulated perinuclear β-catenin in LEPCs led to significant reduction of epithelial clonal growth, but upregulated all three BMP receptors and downregulated LNC-derived noggin, resulting in activation of BMP signaling in LNCs. Addition of noggin that expectedly downregulated nuclear localization of pSmad1/5/8 in LEPCs led to nuclear localization of β-catenin in larger LEPCs but membrane relocation of β-catenin in smaller LEPCs and significant upregulation of DKK1/2. Hence, balancing acts between Wnt signaling and BMP signaling exist not only within LEPCs but also between LEPCs and LNCs to regulate clonal growth of LEPCs.

Abstract: Summary
Small-molecule ligands of nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) govern the transcriptional regulation of metazoan development, cell differentiation, and metabolism. However, the physiological ligands of many NHRs remain poorly characterized, primarily due to lack of robust analytical techniques. Using comparative metabolomics, we identified endogenous steroids that act as ligands of the C. elegans NHR, DAF-12, a vitamin D and liver X receptor homolog regulating larval development, fat metabolism, and lifespan. The identified molecules feature unexpected chemical modifications and include only one of two DAF-12 ligands reported earlier, necessitating a revision of previously proposed ligand biosynthetic pathways. We further show that ligand profiles are regulated by a complex enzymatic network, including the Rieske oxygenase DAF-36, the short-chain dehydrogenase DHS-16, and the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase HSD-1. Our results demonstrate the advantages of comparative metabolomics over traditional candidate-based approaches and provide a blueprint for the identification of ligands for other C. elegans and mammalian NHRs.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining genome integrity requires the accurate and complete replication of chromosomal DNA. This is of the utmost importance for embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which differentiate into cells of all lineages, including germ cells. However, endogenous and exogenous factors frequently induce stalling of replication forks in every cell cycle, which can trigger mutations and chromosomal instabilities. We show here that the oncofetal, nonhistone chromatin factor HMGA2 equips cells with a highly effective first-line defense mechanism against endonucleolytic collapse of stalled forks. This fork-stabilizing function most likely employs scaffold formation at branched DNA via multiple DNA-binding domains. Moreover, HMGA2 works independently of other human factors in two heterologous cell systems to prevent DNA strand breaks. This fork chaperone function seemingly evolved to preserve ESC genome integrity. It is hijacked by tumor (stem) cells to also guard their genomes against DNA-damaging agents widely used to treat cancer patients.

Abstract: Astrocytes produce a complex repertoire of Ca2+ events that coordinate their major functions. The principle of Ca2+ events integration in astrocytes, however, is unknown. Here we analyze whole Ca2+ events, which were defined as spatiotemporally interconnected transient Ca2+ increases. Using such analysis in single hippocampal astrocytes in culture and in slices we found that spreads and durations of Ca2+ events follow power law distributions, a fingerprint of scale-free systems. A mathematical model demonstrated that such Ca2+ dynamics can arise from intracellular inositol-3-phosphate diffusion. The power law exponent (α) was decreased by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) either by specific receptor agonist or by low frequency stimulation of glutamatergic fibers in hippocampal slices. Decrease in α indicated an increase in proportion of large Ca2+ events. Notably, mGluRs activation did not increase the frequency of whole Ca2+ events. This result suggests that neuronal activity does not trigger new Ca2+ events in astrocytes (detectable by our methods), but modulates the properties of existing ones. Thus, our results provide a new perspective on how astrocyte responds to neuronal activity by changing its Ca2+ dynamics, which might further affect local network by triggering release of gliotransmitters and by modulating local blood flow.

Abstract: Summary
Autotransporters deliver virulence factors to the bacterial surface by translocating an effector passenger domain through a membrane-anchored barrel structure. Although passenger domains are diverse, those found in enteric bacteria autotransporters, including AIDA-I in diffusely adhering Escherichia coli (DAEC) and TibA in enterotoxigenic E. coli, are commonly glycosylated. We show that AIDA-I is heptosylated within the bacterial cytoplasm by autotransporter adhesin heptosyltransferase (AAH) and its paralogue AAH2. AIDA-I heptosylation determines DAEC adhesion to host cells. AAH/AAH2 define a bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferase (BAHT) family that contains ferric ion and adopts a dodecamer assembly. Structural analyses of the heptosylated TibA passenger domain reveal 35 heptose conjugates forming patterned and solenoid-like arrays on the surface of a β helix. Additionally, CARC, the AIDA-like autotransporter from Citrobacter rodentium, is essential for colonization in mice and requires heptosylation by its cognate BAHT. Our study establishes a bacterial glycosylation system that regulates virulence and is essential for pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Variant surface antigens play an important role in Plasmodium falciparum malaria pathogenesis and in immune evasion by the parasite. Although most work to date has focused on P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1), two other multigene families encoding STEVOR and RIFIN are expressed in invasive merozoites and on the infected erythrocyte surface. However, their role during parasite infection remains to be clarified. Here we report that STEVOR functions as an erythrocyte-binding protein that recognizes Glycophorin C (GPC) on the red blood cell (RBC) surface and that its binding correlates with the level of GPC on the RBC surface. STEVOR expression on the RBC leads to PfEMP1-independent binding of infected RBCs to uninfected RBCs (rosette formation), while antibodies targeting STEVOR in the merozoite can effectively inhibit invasion. Our results suggest a PfEMP1-independent role for STEVOR in enabling infected erythrocytes at the schizont stage to form rosettes and in promoting merozoite invasion.

Abstract: Summary
In plants, auxin functions as a master controller of development, pattern formation, morphogenesis, and tropic responses. A sophisticated transport system has evolved to allow the establishment of precise spatiotemporal auxin gradients that regulate specific developmental programs. A critical unresolved question relates to how these gradients can be maintained in the presence of open plasmodesmata that allow for symplasmic exchange of essential nutrients and signaling macromolecules. Here we addressed this conundrum using genetic, physiological, and cell biological approaches and identified the operation of an auxin-GSL8 feedback circuit that regulates the level of plasmodesmal-localized callose in order to locally downregulate symplasmic permeability during hypocotyl tropic response. This system likely involves a plasmodesmal switch that would prevent the dissipation of a forming gradient by auxin diffusion through the symplasm. This regulatory system may represent a mechanism by which auxin could also regulate symplasmic delivery of a wide range of signaling agents.

Abstract: Summary
We here report that doxycycline, an antibacterial agent, exerts dramatic effects on human embryonic stem and induced pluripotent stem cells (hESC/iPSCs) survival and self-renewal. The survival-promoting effect was also manifest in cultures of neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from hESC/iPSCs. These doxycycline effects are not associated with its antibacterial action, but mediated by direct activation of a PI3K-AKT intracellular signal. These findings indicate doxycycline as a useful supplement for stem cell cultures, facilitating their growth and maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic cells store neutral lipids such as triacylglycerol (TAG) in lipid droplets (LDs). Here, we have addressed how LDs are functionally linked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We show that, in S. cerevisiae, LD growth is sustained by LD-localized enzymes. When LDs grow in early stationary phase, the diacylglycerol acyl-transferase Dga1p moves from the ER to LDs and is responsible for all TAG synthesis from diacylglycerol (DAG). During LD breakdown in early exponential phase, an ER membrane protein (Ice2p) facilitates TAG utilization for membrane-lipid synthesis. Ice2p has a cytosolic domain with affinity for LDs and is required for the efficient utilization of LD-derived DAG in the ER. Ice2p breaks a futile cycle on LDs between TAG degradation and synthesis, promoting the rapid relocalization of Dga1p to the ER. Our results show that Ice2p functionally links LDs with the ER and explain how cells switch neutral lipid metabolism from storage to consumption.

Abstract: Summary
Zebrafish regenerate their fins via the formation of a population of progenitor cells, the blastema. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for blastemal cell proliferation and patterning of the overlying epidermis. Yet, we find that β-catenin signaling is neither active in the epidermis nor the majority of the proliferative blastemal cells. Rather, tissue-specific pathway interference indicates that Wnt signaling in the nonproliferative distal blastema is required for cell proliferation in the proximal blastema, and signaling in cells lining the osteoblasts directs osteoblast differentiation. Thus, Wnt signaling regulates epidermal patterning, blastemal cell proliferation, and osteoblast maturation indirectly via secondary signals. Gene expression profiling, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and functional rescue experiments suggest that Wnt/β-catenin signaling acts through Fgf and Bmp signaling to control epidermal patterning, whereas retinoic acid and Hedgehog signals mediate its effects on blastemal cell proliferation. We propose that Wnt signaling orchestrates fin regeneration by defining organizing centers that instruct cellular behaviors of adjacent tissues.

Abstract: Summary
During development, the hematopoietic and vascular lineages are thought to descend from common mesodermal progenitors called hemangioblasts. Here we identify six transcription factors, Gata2, Lmo2, Mycn, Pitx2, Sox17, and Tal1, that “trap” murine cells in a proliferative state and endow them with a hemangioblast potential. These “expandable” hemangioblasts (eHBs) are capable, once released from the control of the ectopic factors, to give rise to functional endothelial cells, multilineage hematopoietic cells, and smooth muscle cells. The eHBs can be derived from embryonic stem cells, from fetal liver cells, or poorly from fibroblasts. The eHBs reveal a central role for fibroblast growth factor, which not only promotes their expansion, but also facilitates their ability to give rise to endothelial cells and leukocytes, but not erythrocytes. This study serves as a demonstration that ephemeral progenitor states can be harnessed in vitro, enabling the creation of tractable progenitor cell lines.

Abstract: Summary
Gamma-herpesviruses (γHVs) are widespread oncogenic pathogens that chronically infect circulating lymphocytes. How they subvert the immune check-point function of the spleen to promote persistent infection is not clear. We show that Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) enters the spleen by infecting marginal zone (MZ) macrophages, which provided a conduit to MZ B cells. Relocation of MZ B cells to the white pulp allowed virus transfer to follicular dendritic cells. From here the virus reached germinal center B cells to establish persistent infection. Mice lacking MZ B cells, or treated with a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist to dislocate them, were protected against MuHV-4 colonization. MuHV-4 lacking ORF27, which encodes a glycoprotein necessary for efficient intercellular spread, could infect MZ macrophages but was impaired in long-term infection. Thus, MuHV-4, a γHV, exploits normal immune communication routes to spread by serial lymphoid/myeloid exchange.

Abstract: The protein kinase Src is frequently over-activated in advanced cancers where it modulates the signaling transduction cascade of several growth factors. The feasibility of combination treatment of Src inhibitors with chemotherapy is currently under investigation. We evaluated the anti-tumoral effect of paclitaxel (PTX) in combination with S13, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a prevalent specificity for Src, in a hormone-insensible prostate cancer (PCa) cell model. In vivo, combination treatment with PTX and S13 reduced dramatically PCa tumor growth with a relevant difference in the density of new blood vessels with respect to control and single treatments. This reduction was determined by a concomitant impairment of endothelial cell migration and of VEGF release by cancer cells. In fact, S13, when used alone, was sufficient to reduce tubule formation in vivo, and to inhibit VEGFR2 activation and FAK expression in endothelial cells. In addition, the combination treatment determined a significant reduction in ROS production and HIF-1 stabilization in PCa cells respect to single treatments with S13 or PTX. In conclusion, Src-inhibition could be an effective therapeutic strategy aimed at supporting the anti-angiogenic action of PTX in aggressive PCa.

A novel receptor cross-talk between the ATP receptor P2Y2 and formyl peptide receptors reactivates desensitized neutrophils to produce superoxide,

Abstract: Neutrophils express several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and they cross regulate each other. We described a novel cross-talk mechanism in neutrophils, by which signals generated by the receptor for ATP (P2Y2) reactivate desensitized formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) so that these ligand-bound inactive FPRs resume signaling. At the signaling level, the cross-talk was unidirectional, i.e., P2Y2 ligation reactivated FPR, but not vice versa and was sensitive to the phosphatase inhibitor calyculinA. Further, we show that the cross talk between P2Y2 and FPR bypassed cytosolic Ca2+ transients and did not rely on the actin cytoskeleton. In summary, our data demonstrate a novel cross-talk mechanism that results in reactivation of desensitized FPRs and, an amplification of the neutrophil response to ATP.

Abstract: Summary
The histone lysine demethylase KDM5B regulates gene transcription and cell differentiation and is implicated in carcinogenesis. It contains multiple conserved chromatin-associated domains, including three PHD fingers of unknown function. Here, we show that the first and third, but not the second, PHD fingers of KDM5B possess histone binding activities. The PHD1 finger is highly specific for unmodified histone H3 (H3K4me0), whereas the PHD3 finger shows preference for the trimethylated histone mark H3K4me3. RNA-seq analysis indicates that KDM5B functions as a transcriptional repressor for genes involved in inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. Biochemical analysis reveals that KDM5B associates with components of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex and may cooperate with the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) in gene repression. KDM5B is downregulated in triple-negative breast cancer relative to estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. Overexpression of KDM5B in the MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells suppresses cell migration and invasion, and the PHD1-H3K4me0 interaction is essential for inhibiting migration. These findings highlight tumor-suppressive functions of KDM5B in triple-negative breast cancer cells and suggest a multivalent mechanism for KDM5B-mediated transcriptional regulation.

Abstract: Hemidesmosomes are cell-to-matrix adhesion complexes anchoring keratinocytes to basement membranes. For the first time, we present a method to prepare a fraction from human cultured cells that are highly enriched in hemidesmosomal proteins. Using DJM-1 cells derived from human squamous cell carcinoma, accumulation of hemidesmosomes was observed when these cells were cultured for more than 10 days in a commercial serum-free medium without supplemental calcium. Electron microscopy demonstrated that numerous electron-dense adhesion structures were present along the basal cell membranes of DJM-1 cells cultured under the aforementioned conditions. After removing cellular materials using an ammonia solution, hemidesmosomal proteins and deposited extracellular matrix were collected and separated by electrophoresis. There were eight major polypeptides, which were determined to be plectin, BP230, BP180, integrin α6 and β4 subunits, and laminin-332 by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. Therefore, we designated this preparation as a hemidesmosome-rich fraction. This fraction contained laminin-332 exclusively in its unprocessed form, which may account for the promotion of laminin deposition, and minimal amounts of Lutheran blood group protein, a nonhemidesmosomal transmembrane protein. This hemidesmosome-rich fraction would be useful not only for biological research on hemidesmosomes but also for developing a serum test for patients with blistering skin diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Much of the mortality attributed to influenza virus is due to secondary bacterial pneumonia, particularly from Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, mechanisms underlying this coinfection are incompletely understood. We find that prior influenza infection enhances pneumococcal colonization of the murine nasopharynx, which in turn promotes bacterial spread to the lungs. Influenza accelerates bacterial replication in vivo, and sialic acid, a major component of airway glycoconjugates, is identified as the host-derived metabolite that stimulates pneumococcal proliferation. Influenza infection increases sialic acid and sialylated mucin availability and enhances desialylation of host glycoconjugates. Pneumococcal genes for sialic acid catabolism are required for influenza to promote bacterial growth. Decreasing sialic acid availability in vivo by genetic deletion of the major airway mucin Muc5ac or mucolytic treatment limits influenza-induced pneumococcal replication. Our findings suggest that higher rates of disease during coinfection could stem from influenza-provided sialic acid, which increases pneumococcal proliferation, colonization, and aspiration.

Abstract: Summary
Coronaviruses contain a positive-sense single-stranded genomic (g) RNA, which encodes nonstructural proteins. Several subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) encoding structural proteins are generated by template switching from the body transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) to the leader TRS. The process preferentially generates shorter sgmRNA. Appropriate readthrough of body TRSs is required to produce longer sgmRNAs and full-length gRNA. We find that phosphorylation of the viral nucleocapsid (N) by host glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is required for template switching. GSK-3 inhibition selectively reduces the generation of gRNA and longer sgmRNAs, but not shorter sgmRNAs. N phosphorylation allows recruitment of the RNA helicase DDX1 to the phosphorylated-N-containing complex, which facilitates template readthrough and enables longer sgmRNA synthesis. DDX1 knockdown or loss of helicase activity markedly reduces the levels of longer sgmRNAs. Thus, coronaviruses employ a unique strategy for the transition from discontinuous to continuous transcription to ensure balanced sgmRNAs and full-length gRNA synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cells (DCs) phagocytose, process, and present bacterial antigens to T lymphocytes to trigger adaptive immunity. In vivo, bacteria can also be found inside T lymphocytes. However, T cells are refractory to direct bacterial infection, leaving the mechanisms by which bacteria invade T cells unclear. We show that T cells take up bacteria from infected DCs by the process of transinfection, which requires direct contact between the two cells and is enhanced by antigen recognition. Prior to transfer, bacteria localize to the immunological synapse, an intimate DC/T cell contact structure that activates T cells. Strikingly, T cells efficiently eliminate the transinfecting bacteria within the first hours after infection. Transinfected T cells produced high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and were able to protect mice from bacterial challenge following adoptive transfer. Thus, T lymphocytes can capture and kill bacteria in a manner reminiscent of innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteroidetes are a phylum of Gram-negative bacteria abundant in mammalian-associated polymicrobial communities, where they impact digestion, immunity, and resistance to infection. Despite the extensive competition at high cell density that occurs in these settings, cell contact-dependent mechanisms of interbacterial antagonism, such as the type VI secretion system (T6SS), have not been defined in this group of organisms. Herein we report the bioinformatic and functional characterization of a T6SS-like pathway in diverse Bacteroidetes. Using prominent human gut commensal and soil-associated species, we demonstrate that these systems localize dynamically within the cell, export antibacterial proteins, and target competitor bacteria. The Bacteroidetes system is a distinct pathway with marked differences in gene content and high evolutionary divergence from the canonical T6S pathway. Our findings offer a potential molecular explanation for the abundance of Bacteroidetes in polymicrobial environments, the observed stability of Bacteroidetes in healthy humans, and the barrier presented by the microbiota against pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a potentially replenishable source for the production of transfusable platelets. Here, we describe a method to generate megakaryocytes (MKs) and functional platelets from iPSCs in a scalable manner under serum/feeder-free conditions. The method also permits the cryopreservation of MK progenitors, enabling a rapid “surge” capacity when large numbers of platelets are needed. Ultrastructural/morphological analyses show no major differences between iPSC platelets and human blood platelets. iPSC platelets form aggregates, lamellipodia, and filopodia after activation and circulate in macrophage-depleted animals and incorporate into developing mouse thrombi in a manner identical to human platelets. By knocking out the β2-microglobulin gene, we have generated platelets that are negative for the major histocompatibility antigens. The scalable generation of HLA-ABC-negative platelets from a renewable cell source represents an important step toward generating universal platelets for transfusion as well as a potential strategy for the management of platelet refractoriness.

Abstract: Summary
Microtubules are cytoskeletal polymers with two structurally and functionally distinct ends, the plus- and the minus-end. Here, we focus on the mechanisms underlying the regulation of microtubule minus-ends by the CAMSAP/Nezha/Patronin protein family. We show that CAMSAP2 is required for the proper organization and stabilization of interphase microtubules and directional cell migration. By combining live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution of microtubule assembly from purified components with laser microsurgery, we demonstrate that CAMSAPs regulate microtubule minus-end growth and are specifically deposited on the lattice formed by microtubule minus-end polymerization. This process leads to the formation of CAMSAP-decorated microtubule stretches, which are stabilized from both ends and serve as sites of noncentrosomal microtubule outgrowth. The length of the stretches is regulated by the microtubule-severing protein katanin, which interacts with CAMSAPs. Our data thus indicate that microtubule minus-end assembly drives the stabilization of noncentrosomal microtubules and that katanin regulates this process.

Abstract: Uric acid affects endothelial and adipose cell function and has been linked to diseases such as hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Interestingly uric acid has been shown to increase endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) mobilization, a potential mechanism to repair endothelial injury. Since EPC mobilization is dependent on activity of the enzyme CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)IV, we examined the effect uric acid will have on CD26/DPPIV activity. Uric acid inhibited the CD26/DPPIV associated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells but not human recombinant (hr) CD26/DPPIV. However, triuret, a product of uric acid and peroxynitrite, could inhibit cell associated and hrCD26/DPPIV. Increasing or decreasing intracellular peroxynitrite levels enhanced or decreased the ability of uric acid to inhibit cell associated CD26/DPPIV, respectively. Finally, protein modeling demonstrates how triuret can act as a small molecule inhibitor of CD26/DPPIV activity. This is the first time that uric acid or a uric acid reaction product has been shown to affect enzymatic activity and suggests a novel avenue of research in the role of uric acid in the development of clinically important diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The heterogeneity of brain cancers, as most solid tumors, complicates diagnosis and treatment. Identifying and targeting populations of cells driving tumorigenesis is a top priority for the cancer biology field. This is not a trivial task; considerable variance exists in the driving mutations, identifying markers, and evolutionary pressures influencing initiating cells in different individual tumors. Despite this, the ability to self-renew and differentiate must be conserved to reseed a heterogeneous tumor mass. Focusing on one example of a tumor-initiating cell population, we demonstrate that the atypical cyclin-like protein Spy1 plays a role in balancing the division properties of glioma cells with stemness properties. This mechanistic insight may provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention of brain cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Enteric viruses, including poliovirus and reovirus, encounter a vast microbial community in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, which has been shown to promote virus replication and pathogenesis. Investigating the underlying mechanisms, we find that poliovirus binds bacterial surface polysaccharides, which enhances virion stability and cell attachment by increasing binding to the viral receptor. Additionally, we identified a poliovirus mutant, VP1-T99K, with reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding. Although T99K and WT poliovirus cell attachment, replication, and pathogenesis in mice are equivalent, VP1-T99K poliovirus was unstable in feces following peroral inoculation of mice. Consequently, the ratio of mutant virus in feces is reduced following additional cycles of infection in mice. Thus, the mutant virus incurs a fitness cost when environmental stability is a factor. These data suggest that poliovirus binds bacterial surface polysaccharides, enhancing cell attachment and environmental stability, potentially promoting transmission to a new host.

Abstract: Kashin–Beck disease (KBD) is a chronic endemic osteoarthritis in China. Previous studies have suggested a role of metabolic dysfunction in causation of this disease. In this investigation, the metabolomics approach and cell experiments were used to discover the metabolic changes and their effects on KBD chondrocytes. Nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy was used to examine serum samples from both the KBD patients and normal controls. The pattern recognition multivariate analysis (OSC–PLS) and quantitative analysis (QMTLS iterator) revealed altered glycometabolism in KBD, with increased glucose and decreased lactate and citrate levels. IPA biological analysis showed the centric location of glucose in the metabolic network. Massive glycogen deposits in chondrocytes and increased uptake of glucose by chondrocytes further confirmed disordered glycometabolism in KBD. An in vitro study showed the effects of disordered glycometabolism in chondrocytes. When chondrocytes were treated with high glucose, expression of type II collagen and aggrecan were decreased, while TNF-α expression, the level of cellular reactive oxygen species and cell apoptosis rates all were increased. Therefore, our results demonstrated that disordered glycometabolism in patients with KBD was linked to the damage of chondrocytes. This may provide a new basis for understanding the pathogenesis of KBD.

Abstract: Summary
The intrinsically disordered yeast protein Sem1 (DSS1 in mammals) participates in multiple protein complexes, including the proteasome, but its role(s) within these complexes is uncertain. We report that Sem1 enforces the ordered incorporation of subunits Rpn3 and Rpn7 into the assembling proteasome lid. Sem1 uses conserved acidic segments separated by a flexible linker to grasp Rpn3 and Rpn7. The same segments are used for protein binding in other complexes, but in the proteasome lid they are uniquely deployed for recognizing separate polypeptides. We engineered TEV protease-cleavage sites into Sem1 to show that the tethering function of Sem1 is important for the biogenesis and integrity of the Rpn3-Sem1-Rpn7 ternary complex but becomes dispensable once the ternary complex incorporates into larger lid precursors. Thus, although Sem1 is a stoichiometric component of the mature proteasome, it has a distinct, chaperone-like function specific to early stages of proteasome assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Peripheral blood myelomonocytic cells are important for cytomegalovirus dissemination to distal organs such as salivary glands where persistent replication and shedding dictates transmission patterns. We find that this process is markedly enhanced by the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-encoded CC chemokine, MCK2, which promotes recruitment of CX3CR1hi patrolling monocytes to initial infection sites in the mouse. There, these cells become infected and traffic via the bloodstream to distal sites. In contrast, inflammatory monocytes, the other major myelomonocytic subset, remain virus negative. CX3CR1 deficiency prevents patrolling monocyte migration on the vascular endothelium and interrupts MCMV dissemination to the salivary glands independent of antiviral NK and T cell immune control. In this manner, CX3CR1hi patrolling monocytes serve as immune-privileged vehicles to transport MCMV via the bloodstream to distal organs. MCMV commandeers patrolling monocytes to mediate systemic infection and seed a persistent reservoir essential for horizontal transmission.

Abstract: Ubiquitin-specific protease (USP)19 is a recently identified deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) having multiple splice variants and cellular functions. One variant encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored DUB that rescues misfolded transmembrane proteins from ER-associated degradation (ERAD), but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that USP19 interacts with the ERAD-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH6. Overexpression of USP19 delayed the degradation of MARCH6, leading to an increase in its protein level. In contrast, USP19 depletion resulted in decreased expression of MARCH6. We also show that USP19 overexpression reduced ubiquitination of MARCH6, while its knockdown had the opposite effect. In particular, USP19 was found to protect MARCH6 by deubiquitination from the p97-dependent proteasomal degradation. In addition, USP19 knockdown leads to increased expression of mutant ABCB11, an ERAD substrate of MARCH6. Moreover, USP19 is itself subjected to endoproteolytic processing by DUB activity, and the processing cleaves off an N-terminal cytoplasmic region of unknown function. However, elimination of this processing had no evident effect on MARCH6 stabilization. These results suggest that USP19 is involved in the regulation of ERAD by controlling the stability of MARCH6 via deubiquitination.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic and metagenomic sequencing efforts, including human microbiome projects, reveal that microbes often encode multiple systems that appear to accomplish the same task. Whether these predictions reflect actual functional redundancies is unclear. We report that the prominent human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron employs three functional, homologous vitamin B12 transporters that in at least two cases confer a competitive advantage in the presence of distinct B12 analogs (corrinoids). In the mammalian gut, microbial fitness can be determined by the presence or absence of a single transporter. The total number of distinct corrinoid transporter families in the human gut microbiome likely exceeds those observed in B. thetaiotaomicron by an order of magnitude. These results demonstrate that human gut microbes use elaborate mechanisms to capture and differentiate corrinoids in vivo and that apparent redundancies observed in these genomes can instead reflect hidden specificities that determine whether a microbe will colonize its host.

Abstract: Hispidin, a phenolic compound from Phellinus linteus (a medicinal mushroom), has been shown to possess strong anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and anti-dementia properties. However, the cardioprotective efficacy of hispidin has not yet been investigated. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of hispidin against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. While the treatment of H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells with hydrogen peroxide caused a loss of cell viability and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells, hispidin significantly protected the cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death without any cytotoxicity as determined by XTT assay, LDH release assay, Hoechst 33342 assay, and Western blotting of apoptosis proteins such as caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2. Our data also shows that hispidin significantly scavenged intracellular ROS, and markedly enhanced the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 and catalase, which was accompanied by the concomitant activation of Akt/GSK-3β and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells. The effects of hispidin on Akt and ERK phosphorylation were abrogated by LY294002 (a PI3K/Akt inhibitor) and U0126 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor). The effect of hispidin on GSK-3b activities was also blocked by LY294002. Furthermore, inhibiting the Akt/GSK-3β and ERK1/2 pathway by these inhibitors significantly reversed the hispidin-induced Bax and Bcl-2 expression, apoptosis induction, and ROS production. These findings indicate that hispidin protects against apoptosis in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide through reducing intracellular ROS production, regulating apoptosis-related proteins, and the activation of the Akt/GSK-3β and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common and severe type of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP), and which is currently no method was developed to restore normal structure and function. There are several reports on therapeutic effects of adult stem cell transplantations in animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. However, little is known about how mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) can repair the IPF. In this study, we try to provide the evidence to show that transplanted mesenchymal stem cells directly replace fibrosis with normal lung cells using IPF model mice. As results, transplanted MSC successfully integrated and differentiated into type II lung cell which express surfactant protein. In the other hand, we examine the therapeutic effects of microvesicle treatment, which were released from mesenchymal stem cells. Though the therapeutic effects of MV treatment is less than that of MSC treatment, MV treat-ment meaningfully reduced the symptom of IPF, such as collagen deposition and inflammation. These data suggest that stem cell transplantation may be an effective strategy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis via replacement and cytoprotective effect of microvesicle released from MSCs.

Abstract: Crosstalk between carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells is suggested to mediate phenotype transition of cancer cells as a prerequisite for tumour progression, to predict patients’ outcome, and to influence the efficacy of EGFR inhibitor therapies. Here we investigate the influence of activated fibroblasts as a model for CAFs on phenotype and EGFR signalling in OSCC cells in vitro. For this, immortalised hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts were activated with TGFβ1 and PDGFAB to generate a myofibroblast or proliferative phenotype, respectively. Conditioned media (FCMTGF, FCMPDGF) were used to stimulate PE/CA-PJ15 OSCC cells. Results were compared to the effect of conditioned media of non-stimulated fibroblasts (FCMB). FCMTGF stimulation leads to an up-regulation of vimentin in the OSCC cells and an enhancement of invasive behaviour, indicating EMT-like effects. Similarly, FCMTGF≫FCMPDGF induced up-regulation of EGFR, but not of ErbB2/ErbB3. In addition, we detected an increase in basal activities of ERK, PI3K/Akt and Stat3 (FCMTGF>FCMPDGF) accompanied by protein interaction of vimentin with pERK. These effects are correlated with an increased proliferation. In summary, our results suggest that the activated myofibroblast phenotype provides soluble factors which are able to induce EMT-like phenomena and to increase EGFR signalling as well as cell proliferation in OSCC cells. Our results indicate a possible influence of activated myofibroblasts on EGFR-inhibitor therapy. Therefore, CAFs may serve as promising novel targets for combined therapy strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene that appears to occur during oogenesis and during early embryogenesis. One model proposes that repeat instability depends on the replication fork direction through the repeats such that (CNG)n hairpin-like structures form, causing DNA polymerase to stall and slip. Examining DNA replication fork progression on single DNA molecules at the endogenous FMR1 locus revealed that replication forks stall at CGG repeats in human cells. Furthermore, replication profiles of FXS human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) compared to nonaffected hESCs showed that fork direction through the repeats is altered at the FMR1 locus in FXS hESCs, such that predominantly the CCG strand serves as the lagging-strand template. This is due to the absence of replication initiation that would typically occur upstream of FMR1, suggesting that altered replication origin usage combined with fork stalling promotes repeat instability during early embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
The asexual forms of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum are adapted for chronic persistence in human red blood cells, continuously evading host immunity using epigenetically regulated antigenic variation of virulence-associated genes. Parasite survival on a population level also requires differentiation into sexual forms, an obligatory step for further human transmission. We reveal that the essential nuclear gene, P. falciparum histone deacetylase 2 (PfHda2), is a global silencer of virulence gene expression and controls the frequency of switching from the asexual cycle to sexual development. PfHda2 depletion leads to dysregulated expression of both virulence-associated var genes and PfAP2-g, a transcription factor controlling sexual conversion, and is accompanied by increases in gametocytogenesis. Mathematical modeling further indicates that PfHda2 has likely evolved to optimize the parasite’s infectious period by achieving low frequencies of virulence gene expression switching and sexual conversion. This common regulation of cellular transcriptional programs mechanistically links parasite transmissibility and virulence.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoiesis in the embryo proceeds in a series of waves, with primitive erythroid-biased waves succeeded by definitive waves, within which the properties of hematopoietic stem cells (multilineage potential, self-renewal, and engraftability) gradually arise. Whereas self-renewal and engraftability have previously been examined in the embryo, multipotency has not been thoroughly addressed, especially at the single-cell level or within well-defined populations. To identify when and where clonal multilineage potential arises during embryogenesis, we developed a single-cell multipotency assay. We find that, during the initiation of definitive hematopoiesis in the embryo, a defined population of multipotent, engraftable progenitors emerges that is much more abundant within the yolk sac (YS) than the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) or fetal liver. These experiments indicate that multipotent cells appear in concert within both the YS and AGM and strongly implicate YS-derived progenitors as contributors to definitive hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
In this study, human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocytes (hESC-Heps) were investigated for their ability to support hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and replication. hESC-Heps were capable of supporting the full viral life cycle, including the release of infectious virions. Although supportive, hESC-Hep viral infection levels were not as great as those observed in Huh7 cells. We reasoned that innate immune responses in hESC-Heps may lead to the low level of infection and replication. Upon further investigation, we identified a strong type III interferon response in hESC-Heps that was triggered by HCV. Interestingly, specific inhibition of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway led to an increase in HCV infection and replication in hESC-Heps. Of note, the interferon response was not evident in Huh7 cells. In summary, we have established a robust cell-based system that allows the in-depth study of virus-host interactions in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Toxic liver injury is a leading cause of liver failure and death because of the organ’s inability to regenerate amidst massive cell death, and few therapeutic options exist. The mechanisms coordinating damage protection and repair are poorly understood. Here, we show that S-nitrosothiols regulate liver growth during development and after injury in vivo; in zebrafish, nitric-oxide (NO) enhanced liver formation independently of cGMP-mediated vasoactive effects. After acetaminophen (APAP) exposure, inhibition of the enzymatic regulator S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) minimized toxic liver damage, increased cell proliferation, and improved survival through sustained activation of the cytoprotective Nrf2 pathway. Preclinical studies of APAP injury in GSNOR-deficient mice confirmed conservation of hepatoprotective properties of S-nitrosothiol signaling across vertebrates; a GSNOR-specific inhibitor improved liver histology and acted with the approved therapy N-acetylcysteine to expand the therapeutic time window and improve outcome. These studies demonstrate that GSNOR inhibitors will be beneficial therapeutic candidates for treating liver injury.

Abstract: The cells with mammary repopulating capability can achieve mammary gland morphogenesis in a suitable cellular microenvironment. Using cell surface markers of CD24, CD29 and CD49f, mouse mammary repopulating unit (MRU) has been identified in adult mammary epithelium and late embryonic mammary bud epithelium. However, embryonic MRU remains to be fully characterized at earlier mammary anlagen stage. Here we isolated discrete populations of E14.5 mouse mammary anlagen cells. Only Lin−CD24medCD29+ cell population was predicted as E14.5 MRU by examining their capacities of forming mammosphere and repopulating cleared mammary fat pad in vivo. However, when we characterized gene expressions of this E14.5 cell population by comparing with adult mouse MRU (Lin−CD24+CD29hi), the gene profiling of these two cell populations exhibited great differences. Real-time PCR and immunostaining assays uncovered that E14.5 Lin−CD24medCD29+ cell population was a heterogeneous stroma-enriched cell population. Then, limiting dilutions and single-cell assays also confirmed that E14.5 Lin−CD24medCD29+ cell population possessed low proportion of stem cells. In summary, heterogeneous Lin−CD24medCD29+ cell population exhibited mammary repopulating ability in E14.5 mammary anlagen, implying that only suitable mammary stroma could enable mammary gland morphogenesis, which relied on the interaction between rare stem cells and microenvironment.

Abstract: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common subepidermal autoimmune blistering skin disease characterized by autoantibodies against the hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230. The cell stress chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has been implicated in inflammatory responses, and recent evidence suggests that it represents a novel treatment target in autoimmune bullous diseases. The aim of the study was to investigate the contribution of Hsp90 to the proinflammatory cytokine production in keratinocytes induced by autoantibodies to BP180 from BP patient serum. HaCaT cells were treated with purified human BP or normal IgG in the absence or presence of the Hsp90 blocker 17-DMAG and effects on viability, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 (cytokines critical for BP pathology), NFκB (their major transcription factor), and Hsp70 (marker of effective Hsp90 inhibition and potent negative regulator of inflammatory responses) were investigated. We found that BP IgG stimulated IL-6 and IL-8 release from HaCaT cells and that non-toxic doses of 17-DMAG inhibited this IL-8, but not IL-6 secretion in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Inhibition of this IL-8 production was also observed at the transcriptional level. In addition, 17-DMAG treatment blunted BP IgG-mediated upregulation of NFκB activity and was associated with Hsp70 induction. This study provides important insights that Hsp90 is involved as crucial regulator in anti-BP180 IgG-induced production of keratinocyte-derived IL-8. By adding to the knowledge of the multimodal anti-inflammatory effects of Hsp90 blockade, our data further support the introduction of Hsp90 inhibitors into the clinical setting for treatment of autoimmune diseases, especially for BP.

Abstract: Effector functions in tumor resistance by dendritic cells (DCs) are less well characterized. In this study, we describe that the murine DCs upon stimulation with recombinant IL-15 in vitro or in vivo, expresses TNF superfamily member TRAIL which mediates cytotoxicity and growth inhibition against a murine lymphoma called Dalton lymphoma (DL) via apoptosis. Presence of tumor lysate or intact tumor cells significantly reduces the DC mediated tumoricidal effect, possibly via masking and down-regulating TRAIL in DCs. The antitumor effect of DC derived TRAIL was further augmented by deactivation of STAT3 in tumor cells by cucurbitacin I, which makes it more susceptible to DC derived TRAIL Treatment of tumor cells with cucurbitacin I upregulates TRAIL receptor expression in addition to activation of caspases. Compared to naïve DCs, DCs from tumor bearing mice are significantly impaired in TRAIL expression and consequent antitumor functions against DL which was partially restored by activation with IL-15 or LPS. Priming with recombinant IL-15 prolongs the survival of tumor bearing mice treated with cucurbitacin I. Naïve peripheral blood DCs derived from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients have significant impairment in expression of TRAIL and consequent tumoricidal properties against TRAIL sensitive lymphoma cell lines and primary tumor cells compared to normal control.

Abstract: Intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) formation is observed in some pathological conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and sarcopenia. Several studies have suggested that IMAT formation is not only negatively correlated with skeletal muscle mass but also causes decreased muscle contraction in sarcopenia. In the present study, we examined w hether adipocytes affect myogenesis. For this purpose, skeletal muscle progenitor cells were transfected with siRNA of PPARγ (siPPARγ) in an attempt to inhibit adipogenesis. Myosin heavy chain (MHC)-positive myotube formation was promoted in cells transfected with siPPARγ compared to that of cells transfected with control siRNA. To determine whether direct cell-to-cell contact between adipocytes and myoblasts is a prerequisite for adipocytes to affect myogenesis, skeletal muscle progenitor cells were cocultured with pre- or mature adipocytes in a Transwell coculture system. MHC-positive myotube formation was inhibited when skeletal muscle progenitor cells were cocultured with mature adipocytes, but was promoted when they were cocultured with preadipocytes. Similar effects were observed when pre- or mature adipocyte-conditioned medium was used. These results indicate that preadipocytes play an important role in maintaining skeletal muscle mass by promoting myogenesis; once differentiated, the resulting mature adipocytes negatively affect myogenesis, leading to the muscle deterioration observed in skeletal muscle pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial dysfunction is a central hallmark of diabetes. The transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α is a powerful regulator of metabolism, but its role in endothelial cells remains poorly understood. We show here that endothelial PGC-1α expression is high in diabetic rodents and humans and that PGC-1α powerfully blocks endothelial migration in cell culture and vasculogenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, PGC-1α induces Notch signaling, blunts activation of Rac/Akt/eNOS signaling, and renders endothelial cells unresponsive to established angiogenic factors. Transgenic overexpression of PGC-1α in the endothelium mimics multiple diabetic phenotypes, including aberrant re-endothelialization after carotid injury, blunted wound healing, and reduced blood flow recovery after hindlimb ischemia. Conversely, deletion of endothelial PGC-1α rescues the blunted wound healing and recovery from hindlimb ischemia seen in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Endothelial PGC-1α thus potently inhibits endothelial function and angiogenesis, and induction of endothelial PGC-1α contributes to multiple aspects of vascular dysfunction in diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, DNA is methylated at CpG sites, which play pivotal roles in gene silencing and chromatin organization. Furthermore, DNA methylation undergoes dynamic changes during development, differentiation, and in pathological processes. The conventional methods represent snapshots; therefore, the dynamics of this marker within living organisms remains unclear. To track this dynamics, we made a knockin mouse that expresses a red fluorescent protein (RFP)-fused methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) protein from the ROSA26 locus ubiquitously; we named it MethylRO (methylation probe in ROSA26 locus). Using this mouse, we performed RFP-mediated methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq), whole-body section analysis, and live-cell imaging. We discovered that mobility and pattern of heterochromatin as well as DNA methylation signal intensity inside the nuclei can be markers for cellular differentiation status. Thus, the MethylRO mouse represents a powerful bioresource and technique for DNA methylation dynamics studies in developmental biology, stem cell biology, as well as in disease states.

Abstract: Summary
The stability and activity of numerous signaling proteins in both normal and cancer cells depends on the dimeric molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Hsp90’s function is coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis and requires a series of conformational changes that are regulated by cochaperones and numerous posttranslational modifications (PTMs). SUMOylation is one of the least-understood Hsp90 PTMs. Here, we show that asymmetric SUMOylation of a conserved lysine residue in the N domain of both yeast (K178) and human (K191) Hsp90 facilitates both recruitment of the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-activating cochaperone Aha1 and, unexpectedly, the binding of Hsp90 inhibitors, suggesting that these drugs associate preferentially with Hsp90 proteins that are actively engaged in the chaperone cycle. Importantly, cellular transformation is accompanied by elevated steady-state N domain SUMOylation, and increased Hsp90 SUMOylation sensitizes yeast and mammalian cells to Hsp90 inhibitors, providing a mechanism to explain the sensitivity of cancer cells to these drugs.

Abstract: We have recently shown that freshly isolated astrocytes from the mouse brain express mRNA for the L-channel gene Cav1.3 to at least the same degree (per mg mRNA) as corresponding neurons. The amount of extracellular Ca2+ actually entering cultured astrocytes by its opening is modest, but due to secondary Ca2+-mediated stimulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) the increase in free cytosolic Ca2+ [Ca2+]i is substantial. The other Cav1 subtype expressed in brain is Cav1.2, which is even expressed in higher density. Although the different primers used for the two genes preclude exact quantitative comparison, the present study suggests that this is also the case in the freshly isolated astrocytes and neurons, which express equal Cav1.2 densities. Again, most of the increase in [Ca2+]i occurred by RyR activity. In contrast to Cav1.3 the expression of Cav1.2 was greatly increased (doubled) after two weeks of treatment with fluoxetine hydrochloride (10mg/kg). Accordingly [Ca2+]i in cultured astrocytes exposed to the addition of 10–60mM KCl increased substantially in cultured astrocytes treated chronically with fluoxetine with the lag time until the effect was observed depending upon the fluoxetine concentration. This effect was inhibited by nifedipine or siRNA against Cav1.2. The increase in K+-induced rise in [Ca2+]i after fluoxetine treatment is directly opposite to a decrease in [Ca2+]i after treatment with any of the anti-bipolar drugs lithium, carbamazepine or valproic acid, due to reduced capacitative Ca2+ influx. We have previously shown a similar effect after fluoxetine treatment, but it becomes overridden by the Cav1.2 up-regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transducer BBF2H7/CREB3L2 is an ER-resident transmembrane transcription factor. In response to physiological ER stress, it is processed at the transmembrane region to generate a cytoplasmic N terminus, which contains a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, and luminal C terminus. The BBF2H7 N terminus functions as a transcription factor to promote the expression of ER-Golgi trafficking-related genes and plays crucial roles in chondrocyte differentiation. Here, we found that the BBF2H7 C terminus is secreted into the extracellular space as a signaling molecule for cell-to-cell communication. The secreted BBF2H7 C terminus directly binds to both Indian hedgehog and its receptor Patched-1, followed by activation of Hedgehog signaling, resulting in promoting the proliferation of neighboring chondrocytes. The dual N- and C-terminal functions of BBF2H7 triggered by physiological ER stress may allow chondrocytes to simultaneously regulate distinct cellular events for differentiation and proliferation in developing cartilage.

Abstract: Summary
Perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) elicits host transcriptional reprogramming as part of the immune response. Although pathogen perception is well studied, the signaling networks orchestrating immune gene expression remain less clear. In a genetic screen for components involved in the early immune gene transcription reprogramming, we identified Arabidopsis RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase-like 3 (CPL3) as a negative regulator of immune gene expression. MAMP perception induced rapid and transient cyclin-dependent kinase C (CDKC)-mediated phosphorylation of Arabidopsis CTD. The CDKCs, which are in turn phosphorylated and activated by a canonical MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade, represent a point of signaling convergence downstream of multiple immune receptors. CPL3 directly dephosphorylated CTD to counteract MAPK-mediated CDKC regulation. Thus, modulation of the phosphorylation dynamics of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II transcription machinery by MAPKs, CTD kinases, and phosphatases constitutes an essential mechanism for rapid orchestration of host immune gene expression and defense upon pathogen attacks.

Abstract: This study investigates how epithelial cells moving together function to coordinate their collective movement to repair a wound. Using a lens ex vivo mock cataract surgery model we show that region-specific reorganization of cell–cell junctions, cytoskeletal networks and myosin function along apical and basal domains of an epithelium mediates the process of collective migration. An apical junctional complex composed of N-cadherin/ZO-1/myosin II linked to a cortical actin cytoskeleton network maintains integrity of the tissue during the healing process. These cells’ basal domains often preceded their apical domains in the direction of movement, where an atypical N-cadherin/ZO-1 junction, linked to an actin stress fiber network rich in phosphomyosin, was prominent in cryptic lamellipodia. These junctions joined the protruding forward-moving lamellipodia to the back end of the cell moving directly in front of it. These were the only junctions detected in cryptic lamellipodia of lens epithelia migrating in response to wounding that could transmit the protrusive forces that drive collective movement. Both integrity of the epithelium and ability to effectively heal the wound was found to depend on myosin mechanical cues.

Abstract: Summary
Segmentation is a fundamental problem that dominates the success of microscopic image analysis. In almost 25 years of cell detection software development, there is still no single piece of commercial software that works well in practice when applied to early mouse embryo or stem cell image data. To address this need, we developed MINS (modular interactive nuclear segmentation) as a MATLAB/C++-based segmentation tool tailored for counting cells and fluorescent intensity measurements of 2D and 3D image data. Our aim was to develop a tool that is accurate and efficient yet straightforward and user friendly. The MINS pipeline comprises three major cascaded modules: detection, segmentation, and cell position classification. An extensive evaluation of MINS on both 2D and 3D images, and comparison to related tools, reveals improvements in segmentation accuracy and usability. Thus, its accuracy and ease of use will allow MINS to be implemented for routine single-cell-level image analyses.

Abstract: SNPs in human AFP promoter are associated with serum AFP levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting that AFP promoter variants may generate better transcriptional activities while retaining high specificity to AFP-producing cells. We sequenced human AFP promoters, cloned 15 different genotype promoters and tested their reporter activities in AFP-producing and non-producing cells. Among various AFP variant fragments tested, EA4D exhibited the highest reporter activity and thus was selected for the further study. EA4D was fused with tBid and coupled with nano-particle vector (H1) to form pGL3-EA4D-tBid/H1. pGL3-EA4D-tBid/H1 could express a high level of tBid while retain the specificity to AFP-producing cells. In a HCC tumor model, application of pGL3-EA4D-tBid/H1 significantly inhibited the growth of AFP-producing-implanted tumors with minimal side-effects, but had no effect on non-AFP-producing tumors. Furthermore, pGL3-EA4D-tBid/H1 could significantly sensitize HCC cells to sorafenib, an approved anti-HCC agent. Collectively, pGL3-EA4D-tBid/H1, a construct with the AFP promoter EA4D and the novel H1 delivery system, can specifically target and effectively suppress the AFP-producing HCC. This new therapeutic tool shows little toxicity in vitro and in vivo and it should thus be safe for further clinical tests.

Abstract: The purine-derived analogs, roscovitine and purvalanol are selective synthetic inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) induced cell cycle arrest and lead to apoptotic cell death in various cancer cells. Although a number of studies investigated the molecular mechanism of each CDK inhibitor on apoptotic cell death mechanism with their therapeutic potential, their regulatory role on autophagy is not clarified yet. In this paper, our aim was to investigate molecular mechanism of CDK inhibitors on autophagy and apoptosis in wild type (wt) and Bax deficient HCT 116 cells. Exposure of HCT 116 wt and Bax−/− cells to roscovitine or purvalanol for 24h decreased cell viability in dose-dependent manner. However, Bax deficient HCT 116 cells were found more resistant against purvalanol treatment compared to wt cells. We also established that both CDK inhibitors induced apoptosis through activating mitochondria-mediated pathway in caspase-dependent manner regardless of Bax expression in HCT 116 colon cancer cells. Concomitantly, we determined that purvalanol was also effective on autophagy in HCT 116 colon cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA treatment enhanced the purvalanol induced apoptotic cell death in HCT 116 Bax−/− cells. Our results revealed that mechanistic action of each CDK inhibitor on cell death mechanism differs. While purvalanol treatment activated apoptosis and autophagy in HCT 116 cells, roscovitine was only effective on caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Another important difference between two CDK inhibitors, although roscovitine treatment overcame Bax-mediated drug resistance in HCT 116 cells, purvalanol did not exert same effect.

Abstract: Taurine was previously reported to increase the proliferation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) from subventricular zone of the mouse brain. The results of a study that aimed to understand the mechanisms of this effect are presented here. Because taurine was not found in NPC nuclei, direct interactions with nuclear elements seem unlikely. A gene expression profile analysis indicated that genes that are regulated by taurine have roles in i) proliferation, including the Shh and Wnt pathways; ii) cellular adhesion; iii) cell survival; and iv) mitochondrial functioning. Cell cycle analysis of propidium iodide and CFSE-labeled cells using flow cytometry revealed an increase in the number of cells in the S-phase and a decrease in those in the G0/G1 phase in taurine-treated cultures. No changes in the length of the cell cycle were observed. Quantification of the viable, apoptotic, and necrotic cells in cultures using flow cytometry and calcein-AM, annexin-V, and propidium iodide staining showed reductions in the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells (18% to 11% and 13% to 10%, respectively) and increases in the number of viable cells (61% to 69%) in the taurine-treated cultures. Examination of the relative mitochondrial potential values by flow cytometry and rhodamine123 or JC-1 staining showed a 44% increase in the number of cells with higher mitochondrial potential and a 38% increase in the mitochondrial membrane potential in taurine cultures compared with those of controls. Taken together, the results suggest that taurine provides more favorable conditions for cell proliferation by improving mitochondrial functioning.

Abstract: Epidermal neural crest stem cells (EPI-NCSCs), which reside in the bulge of hair follicles, are attractive candidates for several applications in cell therapy, drug screening and tissue engineering. As suggested remnants of the embryonic neural crest (NC) in an adult location, EPI-NCSCs are able to generate a wide variety of cell types and are readily accessible by a minimally invasive procedure. Since the combination of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor type 2 (FGF2) is mitogenic and promotes the neuronal commitment of various stem cell populations, we examined its effects in the proliferation and neuronal potential of mouse EPI-NCSCs. By using a recognized culture protocol of bulge whiskers follicles, we were able to isolate a population of EPI-NCSCs, characterized by the migratory potential, cell morphology and expression of phenotypic markers of NC cells. EPI-NCSCs expressed neuronal, glial and smooth muscle markers and exhibited the NC-like fibroblastic morphology. The treatment with the combination EGF and FGF2, however, increased their proliferation rate and promoted the acquisition of a neuronal-like morphology accompanied by reorganization of neural cytoskeletal proteins βIII-tubulin and nestin, as well as upregulation of the pan neuronal marker βIII-tubulin and down regulation of the undifferentiated NC, glial and smooth muscle cell markers. Moreover, the treatment enhanced the response of EPI-NCSCs to neurogenic stimulation, as evidenced by induction of GAP43, and increased expression of Mash-1 in neuron-like cell, both neuronal-specific proteins. Together, the results suggest that the combination of EGF–FGF2 stimulates the proliferation and improves the neuronal potential of EPI-NCSCs similarly to embryonic NC cells, ES cells and neural progenitor/stem cells of the central nervous system and highlights the advantage of using EGF–FGF2 in neuronal differentiation protocols.

Abstract: Summary
5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of metabolism and survival during energy stress. Dysregulation of AMPK is strongly associated with oxidative-stress-related disease. However, whether and how AMPK is regulated by intracellular redox status remains unknown. Here we show that the activity of AMPK is negatively regulated by oxidation of Cys130 and Cys174 in its α subunit, which interferes with the interaction between AMPK and AMPK kinases (AMPKK). Reduction of Cys130/Cys174 is essential for activation of AMPK during energy starvation. Thioredoxin1 (Trx1), an important reducing enzyme that cleaves disulfides in proteins, prevents AMPK oxidation, serving as an essential cofactor for AMPK activation. High-fat diet consumption downregulates Trx1 and induces AMPK oxidation, which enhances cardiomyocyte death during myocardial ischemia. Thus, Trx1 modulates activation of the cardioprotective AMPK pathway during ischemia, functionally linking oxidative stress and metabolism in the heart.

Abstract: Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of the F0F1-ATPase subunit c from rat liver mitochondria (RLM) were purified and their effect on the opening of the permeability transition pore (mPTP) was investigated. Addition of dephosphorylated subunit c to RLM induced mitochondrial swelling, decreased the membrane potential and reduced the Ca2+ uptake capacity, which was prevented by cyclosporin A. The same effect was observed in the presence of storage subunit c purified from livers of sheep affected with ceroid lipofuscinosis. In black-lipid bilayer membranes subunit c increased the conductance due to formation of single channels with fast and slow kinetics. The dephosphorylated subunit c formed channels with slow kinetics, i.e. the open state being of significantly longer duration than in the case of channels formed by the phosphorylated form that had short life spans and fast kinetics. The channels formed were cation-selective more so with the phosphorylated form. Subunit c of rat liver mitochondria was able to bind Ca2+. Collectively, the data allowed us to suppose that subunit c F0F1-ATPase might be a structural/regulatory component of mPTP exerting its role in dependence on phosphorylation status.

Abstract: Summary
Plant perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) triggers a phosphorylation relay leading to PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Despite increasing knowledge of PTI signaling, how immune homeostasis is maintained remains largely unknown. Here we describe a forward-genetic screen to identify loci involved in PTI and characterize the Arabidopsis calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK28 as a negative regulator of immune signaling. Genetic analyses demonstrate that CPK28 attenuates PAMP-triggered immune responses and antibacterial immunity. CPK28 interacts with and phosphorylates the plasma-membrane-associated cytoplasmic kinase BIK1, an important convergent substrate of multiple pattern recognition receptor (PRR) complexes. We find that BIK1 is rate limiting in PTI signaling and that it is continuously turned over to maintain cellular homeostasis. We further show that CPK28 contributes to BIK1 turnover. Our results suggest a negative regulatory mechanism that continually buffers immune signaling by controlling the turnover of this key signaling kinase.

Abstract: Summary
Direct conversion of nonneural cells to functional neurons holds great promise for neurological disease modeling and regenerative medicine. We previously reported rapid reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into mature induced neuronal (iN) cells by forced expression of three transcription factors: ASCL1, MYT1L, and BRN2. Here, we show that ASCL1 alone is sufficient to generate functional iN cells from mouse and human fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells, indicating that ASCL1 is the key driver of iN cell reprogramming in different cell contexts and that the role of MYT1L and BRN2 is primarily to enhance the neuronal maturation process. ASCL1-induced single-factor neurons (1F-iN) expressed mature neuronal markers, exhibited typical passive and active intrinsic membrane properties, and formed functional pre- and postsynaptic structures. Surprisingly, ASCL1-induced iN cells were predominantly excitatory, demonstrating that ASCL1 is permissive but alone not deterministic for the inhibitory neuronal lineage.

Abstract: The Golgi apparatus is a highly dynamic organelle which frequently undergoes morphological changes in certain normal physiological processes or in response to stress. The mechanisms are largely not known. We have found that heat shock of Panc1 cells expressing core 2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-M (Panc1-C2GnT-M) induces Golgi disorganization by increasing non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA)–C2GnT-M complexes and polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of C2GnT-M. These effects are prevented by inhibition or knockdown of NMIIA. Also, the speed of Golgi fragmentation induced by heat shock is found to be positively correlated with the levels of C2GnT-M in the Golgi. The results are reproduced in LNCaP cells expressing high levels of two endogenous glycosyltransferases—core 2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-L:1 and β-galactoside:α2-3 sialyltransferase 1. Further, during recovery after heat shock, Golgi reassembly as monitored by a Golgi matrix protein giantin precedes the return of C2GnT-M to the Golgi. The results are consistent with the roles of giantin as a building block of the Golgi architecture and a docking site for transport vesicles carrying glycosyltransferases. In addition, inhibition/depletion of HSP70 or HSP90 in Panc1-C2GnT-M cells also causes an increase of NMIIA–C2GnT-M complexes and NMIIA-mediated Golgi fragmentation but results in accumulation or degradation of C2GnT-M, respectively. These results can be explained by the known functions of these two HSP: participation of HSP90 in protein folding and HSP70 in protein folding and degradation. We conclude that NMIIA is the master regulator of Golgi fragmentation induced by heat shock or inhibition/depletion of HSP70/90.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors subpopulations of therapy-resistant tumor-initiating cells (TICs) that are self-renewing and multipotent. To understand the regulation of the TIC state, we performed an image-based screen for genes regulating GBM TIC maintenance and identified ZFHX4, a 397 kDa transcription factor. ZFHX4 is required to maintain TIC-associated and normal human neural precursor cell phenotypes in vitro, suggesting that ZFHX4 regulates differentiation, and its suppression increases glioma-free survival in intracranial xenografts. ZFHX4 interacts with CHD4, a core member of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. ZFHX4 and CHD4 bind to overlapping sets of genomic loci and control similar gene expression programs. Using expression data derived from GBM patients, we found that ZFHX4 significantly affects CHD4-mediated gene expression perturbations, which defines ZFHX4 as a master regulator of CHD4. These observations define ZFHX4 as a regulatory factor that links the chromatin-remodeling NuRD complex and the GBM TIC state.

Abstract: Targeted molecular imaging to detect changes in the structural and functional organization of tissues, at the molecular level, is a promising approach for effective and early diagnosis of diseases. Quantitative and qualitative changes in type I collagen, which is a major component in the extra cellular matrix (ECM) of skin and other vital organs like lung, liver, heart and kidneys, are often associated with the pathophysiology of these organs. We have synthesized a fluorescent probe that comprises collagelin, a specific collagen binding peptide, coupled to fluorescent porphyrin that can effectively detect abnormal deposition of collagen in live tissues by emitting fluorescence in the near infra red (NIR) region. In this report we have presented the methodology for coupling of 5-(4-carboxy phenyl)-10, 15, 20-triphenyl porphyrin (C-TPP) to the N-terminal of collagelin or to another mutant peptide (used as a control). We have evaluated the efficacy of these fluorescent peptides to detect collagen deposition in live normal and abnormal tissues. Our results strongly suggest that porphyrin-tagged collagelin can be used as an effective probe for the non invasive in vivo detection of tissue fibrosis, especially in the liver.

Abstract: High temperature often induces oxidative stress and antioxidant response in insects. This phenomenon has been well documented under controlled laboratory conditions, but whether it happens under fluctuating field conditions is largely unknown. In this study, we used an invasive lace bug (Corythucha ciliata) as a model species to compare the effects of controlled thermal treatments (2 h at 33–43°C with 2°C intervals in the laboratory) and naturally fluctuating thermal conditions (08:00–14:00 at 2-h intervals (29.7–37.2 °C) on a hot summer day in a field in Shanghai, China) on lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde (MDA) was the marker) and anaerobic respiration (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was the marker), as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione reductase (GR). The results show that MDA concentration increased significantly in response to heat stresses with similar trend in the laboratory and field. LDH activities did not significantly vary across temperatures in the laboratory-exposed individuals, but they significantly increased by rising temperature in the field. The activities or concentrations of SOD, CAT, GSH, and GR all significantly increased with increasing temperature in the two populations. These findings indicate that high temperature induces oxidative stress, resulting in high anaerobic respiration and antioxidant defenses in C. ciliata under both the laboratory and field conditions, which likely provide a defense mechanism against oxidative damage due to the accumulation of ROS.

Abstract: The challenge in manipulating the proportion of somatic stem cells lies in having to override tissue homeostasis. Xanthosine infusion via the teat canal has been reported to augment the number of label-retaining cells in the mammary gland of 3-month-old bovine calves. To further delineate xanthosine׳s effect on defined stem cells in the mammary gland of heifers—which are candidates for increased prospective milk production following such manipulation—bovine mammary parenchymal tissue was transplanted and integrated into the cleared mammary fat pad of immunodeficient mice. Xanthosine administration for 14 days did not affect the number of label-retaining cells after 10- and 11-week chases. No change in stem cell proportion, analyzed according to CD49f and CD24 expression, was noted. Clone formation and propagation rate of cultured cells, as well as expression of stem cell markers, were also unaffected. In contrast, a latent 50% decrease in bovine mammary cell proliferation rate was observed 11 weeks after xanthosine administration. Tumor development in mice was also limited by xanthosine administration. These effects may have resulted from an initial decrease in expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in guanine synthesis, IMPDH. The data indicate that caution should be exerted when considering xanthosine for stem cell manipulation.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are capable of extensive self-renewal and expansion and can differentiate into any somatic tissue, making them useful for regenerative medicine applications. Allogeneic transplantation of hESC-derived tissues from results in immunological rejection absent adjunctive immunosuppression. The goal of our study was to generate a universal pluripotent stem cell source by nucleofecting a mutated human leukocyte antigen G (mHLA-G) gene into hESCs using the PiggyBac transposon. We successfully generated stable mHLA-G(EF1α)-hESC lines using chEF1α promoter system that stably expressed mHLA-G protein during prolonged undifferentiated proliferation andin differentiated embryoid bodies as well as teratomas. Morphology, karyotype, and telomerase activity of mHLA-G expressing hESC were normal. Immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis revealed persistent expression of pluripotent markers, OCT-3/4 and SSEA-4, in undifferentiated mHLA-G(EF1α)-hESC. Nucleofected hESC formed teratomas and when directed to differentiate into epidermal precursors, expressed high levels of mHLA-G and keratinocyte markers K14 and CD29. Natural killer cell cytotoxicity assays demonstrated a significant decrease in lysis of mHLA-G(EF1a)-hESC targets relative to control cells. Similar results were obtained with mHLA-G(EF1α)-hESC-derived epidermal progenitors (hEEP). One way mixed T lymphocyte reactions unveiled that mHLA-G(EF1a)-hESC and -hEEP restrained the proliferative activity of mixed T lymphocytes. We conclude that heterologous expression of mHLA-G decreases immunogenicity of hESCs and their epidermal differentiated derivatives.

Abstract: Organ fibrosis has been viewed as a major medical problem that leads to progressive dysfunction of the organ and eventually the death of patients. Stress-related hormone norepinephrine (NE) has been reported to exert fibrogenic actions in the injured organ. Nix plays a critical role in pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling and heart failure through mediating cardiomyocyte apoptosis. However, cardiac remodeling also includes fibrosis. Whether Nix is involved in stress-induced fibrosis remains unclear. The present study was designed to determine the role of Nix in NE-induced NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. The results showed that Nix was upregulated and closely associated with cell proliferation, collagen and fibronectin expression in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts following NE treatment. Overexpression of Nix promoted collagen and fibronectin expression, whereas the suppression of Nix resulted in a strong reduction in collagen and fibronectin expression. Moreover, the increases in collagen and fibronectin expression induced by NE were successively increased when Nix was overexpressed and reduced when Nix was inhibited. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the PKC activation is responsible for the upregulation of Nix induced by NE. Inhibition of Nix expression with α-adrenoceptor antagonist, β-adrenoceptor antagonist or PKC inhibitor attenuated NE-induced collagen and fibronectin expression. Our data revealed that Nix is a novel mediator of NE-induced fibrosis. Thus, it would provide a new insight into the development of effective preventative measures and therapies of tissue fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
The Wnt canonical ligands elicit the activation of β-catenin transcriptional activity, a response dependent on, but not limited to, β-catenin stabilization through the inhibition of GSK3 activity. Two mechanisms have been proposed for this inhibition, one dependent on the binding and subsequent block of GSK3 to LRP5/6 Wnt coreceptor and another one on its sequestration into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Here we report that internalization of the GSK3-containing Wnt-signalosome complex into MVBs is dependent on the dissociation of p120-catenin/cadherin from this complex. Disruption of cadherin-LRP5/6 interaction is controlled by cadherin phosphorylation and requires the previous separation of p120-catenin; thus, p120-catenin and cadherin mutants unable to dissociate from the complex block GSK3 sequestration into MVBs. These mutants substantially inhibit, but do not completely prevent, the β-catenin upregulation caused by Wnt3a. These results, besides elucidating how GSK3 is sequestered into MVBs, support this mechanism as cause of β-catenin stabilization by Wnt.

Abstract: Summary
Pneumonic plague is a deadly respiratory disease caused by Yersinia pestis. The bacterial protease Pla contributes to disease progression and manipulation of host immunity, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are largely unknown. Here we show that Pla degrades the apoptotic signaling molecule Fas ligand (FasL) to prevent host cell apoptosis and inflammation. Wild-type Y. pestis, but not a Pla mutant (Δpla), degrades FasL, which results in decreased downstream caspase-3/7 activation and reduced apoptosis. Similarly, lungs of mice challenged with wild-type Y. pestis show reduced levels of FasL and activated caspase-3/7 compared to Δpla infection. Consistent with a role for FasL in regulating immune responses, Δpla infection results in aberrant proinflammatory cytokine levels. The loss of FasL or inhibition of caspase activity alters host inflammatory responses and enables enhanced Y. pestis outgrowth in the lungs. Thus, by degrading FasL, Y. pestis manipulates host cell death pathways to facilitate infection.

Cyclic tensile force up-regulates BMP-2 expression through MAP kinase and COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathways in human periodontal ligament cells,

Abstract: Periodontal ligament cells play important roles in the homeostasis of periodontal tissue by mechanical stress derived from mastication, such as tension, compression, fluid shear, and hydrostatic force. In the present study, we showed that cyclic tensile force increased the gene expression level of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, a crucial regulator of mineralization, in human periodontal ligament cells using real-time PCR. Signaling inhibitors, PD98059/U0126 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitors) and SB203580/SB202190 (p38 inhibitors), revealed that tensile force-mediated BMP-2 expression was dependent on activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways. Cyclic tensile force also induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression in a manner dependent on ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase pathways, and induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthesis. NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor, significantly reduced tensile force-mediated BMP-2 expression, indicating that PGE2 synthesized by COX-2 may be involved in the BMP-2 induction. The inhibitory effect of NS-398 was completely restored by the addition of exogenous PGE2. However, stimulation with PGE2 alone in the absence of tensile force had no effect on the BMP-2 induction, indicating that some critical molecule(s) other than COX-2/PGE2 may be required for cyclic tensile force-mediated BMP-2 induction. Collectively, the results indicate that cyclic tensile force activates ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways, and induces COX-2 expression, which is responsible for the sequential PGE2 biosynthesis and release, and furthermore, mediates the increase in BMP-2 expression at the transcriptional level.

Abstract: In this study, we cloned a full-length cDNA of heat shock protein (HSP) gene of Apolygus lucorum (Meyer-Dür) [AlHSP90, KC109781] and investigated its expression in response to temperature and pesticide stresses. The open reading frame (ORF) of AlHSP90 is 2,169 bp in length, encoding a 722 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 82.99 kDa. Transcriptional and translational expression profiles of AlHSP90 under extreme temperature or pesticide stresses were examined by fluorescent real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot. Results showed that the expression profiles of AlHSP90 protein were in high agreement with those of AlHSP90 RNA and indicated that AlHSP90 was not only an important gene for A. lucorum adults in response to extremely high temperature, but also involved in the resistance or tolerance to cyhalothrin, imidacloprid, chlorpyrifos, and emamectin benzoate, especially for female adults to emamectin benzoate and for male adults to cyhalothrin. Transcriptional results of AlHSP90 also confirmed that AlHSP90 was an important gene involved in the resistance or tolerance to both temperature and pesticide stresses. In addition, our study also revealed that ∼24°C may be the suitable temperature range for A. lucorum survival, which is also confirmed by the results of the expression of AlHSP90, the nymph mortality, and the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) when A. lucorum is reared at six different temperatures. Therefore, these studies are significant in elucidating the AlHSP90 in response to temperature and pesticide stresses and would provide guidance for A. lucorum management with different pesticides or temperatures in fields.

Abstract: The present study has been carried out to describe the cell morphology of the developing male gametes in a fish ectoparasite, Argulus bengalensis Ramakrishna, 1951. With respect to cell volume and nucleoplasmic index, spermatogonia are the smallest and primary spermatocytes are the largest in this lineage. The spermatogonia and the differentiating spermatogenic cells are in separate niches and confined to different enclaves within each testicular lobe. Spermiogenesis occurs within the inner enclave of each testicular lobe. During this process the nucleus becomes streamlined; an acrosome is formed, axoneme is originated, and residual cytoplasm is discarded through the flagellum. The sperm cell morphology displays a general pattern comprising head, mid-piece, and a full length flagellum. In the axoneme 9+2 arrangement of the microtubule is conserved. In addition to the axoneme, some more singlet microtubules are found surrounding a fiber sheath and around one of the mitochondria adjacent to the axoneme. This arrangement indicates a close phylogenetic relationship with pentastomida. In the present study, structure and formation of spermatophore are described in this branchiuran parasite.

Abstract: Within the field of dental tissue engineering, the establishment of adequate tissue vascularization is one of the most important burdens to overcome. As vascular access within the tooth is restricted by the apical foramen, it is of major importance to implement effective vascularization strategies in order to recreate viable components of teeth and periodontal tissues. However, while the current regenerative approaches focus on the use of dental stem cells (DSCs), little is known about these cells and their ability to promote angiogenesis. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the paracrine angiogenic properties of postnatal DSCs, in particular dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAPs) and dental follicle precursor cells (FSCs). An antibody array, together with RT-PCR and ELISA, pointed out the differential expression of pro-angiogenic as well as anti-angiogenic factors by cultured DSCs and human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1). Despite the secretion of proliferation-promoting factors, DSCs caused no notable increase in the proliferation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). With regard to other aspects of the angiogenic cascade, DPSCs, SCAPs and HGF-1 significantly promoted endothelial migration in a transwell migration assay. DPSCs also had a pronounced effect on endothelial tubulogenesis, as was shown by an in vitro Matrigel™ assay. In the last part of this study, a chorioallantoic membrane assay demonstrated a sustained pro-angiogenic impact of DPSCs and SCAPs in an in vivo setting. Collectively, these data indicate a predominant pro-angiogenic influence of DPSCs and SCAPS in vitro and in vivo in comparison to FSCs, suggesting that both stem cell populations could potentially promote the vascularization of regenerated dental tissues.

Abstract: Summary
The differentiated state of somatic cells provides barriers for the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). To address why some cell types reprogram more readily than others, we studied the effect of combined modulation of cellular signaling pathways. Surprisingly, inhibition of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) together with activation of Wnt signaling in the presence of ascorbic acid allows >80% of murine fibroblasts to acquire pluripotency after 1 week of reprogramming factor expression. In contrast, hepatic and blood progenitors predominantly required only TGF-β inhibition or canonical Wnt activation, respectively, to reprogram at efficiencies approaching 100%. Strikingly, blood progenitors reactivated endogenous pluripotency loci in a highly synchronous manner, and we demonstrate that expression of specific chromatin-modifying enzymes and reduced TGF-β/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity are intrinsic properties associated with the unique reprogramming response of these cells. Our observations define cell-type-specific requirements for the rapid and synchronous reprogramming of somatic cells.

Abstract: Fibrosis is the important pathway for end-stage renal failure. Glucose has been demonstrated to be the most important fibrogenesis-inducing agent according to previous studies. Despite diosgenin has been demonstrated to be anti-inflammatory, the possible role in fibrosis regulation of diosgenin remain to be investigated. In this study, renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (designated as HK-2) were treated with high concentration of glucose (HG, 27.5mM) to determine whether diosgenin (0.1, 1 and 10μM) has the effects to regulate renal cellular fibrosis. We found that 10μM of diosgenin exert optimal inhibitory effects on high glucose-induced fibronectin expression in HK-2 cells. In addition, diosgenin markedly inhibited HG-induced increase in α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and HG-induced decrease in E-cadherin. In addition, diosgenin antagonizes high glucose-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signals partly by enhancing the catabolism of Snail in renal cells. Collectively, these data suggest that diosgenin has the potential to inhibit high glucose-induced renal tubular fibrosis possibly through EMT pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) enable rapid proliferation that also causes DNA damage. To maintain genomic stabilization during rapid proliferation, ESCs must have an efficient system to repress genotoxic stress. Here, we show that withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which maintains the self-renewal capability of mouse ESCs (mESCs), significantly inhibits the cell proliferation and DNA damage of mESCs and upregulates the expression of miR-590. miR-590 promotes single-strand break (SSB) and double-strand break (DSB) damage repair, thus slowing proliferation of mESCs without influencing stemness. miR-590 directly targets Activin receptor type 2a (Acvr2a) to mediate Activin signaling. We identified the homologous recombination-mediated repair (HRR) gene, Rad51b, as a downstream molecule of the miR-590/Acvr2a pathway regulating the SSB and DSB damage repair and cell cycle. Our study shows that a miR-590/Acvr2a/Rad51b signaling axis ensures the stabilization of mESCs by balancing DNA damage repair and rapid proliferation during self-renewal.

Abstract: Summary
To successfully establish infection, flaviviruses have to overcome the antiviral state induced by type I interferon (IFN-I). The nonstructural NS5 proteins of several flaviviruses antagonize IFN-I signaling. Here we show that yellow fever virus (YFV) inhibits IFN-I signaling through a unique mechanism that involves binding of YFV NS5 to the IFN-activated transcription factor STAT2 only in cells that have been stimulated with IFN-I. This NS5-STAT2 interaction requires IFN-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and the K63-linked polyubiquitination at a lysine in the N-terminal region of YFV NS5. We identified TRIM23 as the E3 ligase that interacts with and polyubiquitinates YFV NS5 to promote its binding to STAT2 and trigger IFN-I signaling inhibition. Our results demonstrate the importance of YFV NS5 in overcoming the antiviral action of IFN-I and offer a unique example of a viral protein that is activated by the same host pathway that it inhibits.

Abstract: Summary
Transplantation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is being developed as a cell-replacement therapy for age-related macular degeneration. Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE are currently translating toward clinic. We introduce the adult human RPE stem cell (hRPESC) as an alternative RPE source. Polarized monolayers of adult hRPESC-derived RPE grown on polyester (PET) membranes had near-native characteristics. Trephined pieces of RPE monolayers on PET were transplanted subretinally in the rabbit, a large-eyed animal model. After 4 days, retinal edema was observed above the implant, detected by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and fundoscopy. At 1 week, retinal atrophy overlying the fetal or adult transplant was observed, remaining stable thereafter. Histology obtained 4 weeks after implantation confirmed a continuous polarized human RPE monolayer on PET. Taken together, the xeno-RPE survived with retained characteristics in the subretinal space. These experiments support that adult hRPESC-derived RPE are a potential source for transplantation therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived endothelial cells and their progenitors may provide the means for vascularization of tissue-engineered constructs and can serve as models to study vascular development and disease. Here, we report a method to efficiently produce endothelial cells from hPSCs via GSK3 inhibition and culture in defined media to direct hPSC differentiation to CD34+CD31+ endothelial progenitors. Exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment was dispensable, and endothelial progenitor differentiation was β-catenin dependent. Furthermore, by clonal analysis, we showed that CD34+CD31+CD117+TIE-2+ endothelial progenitors were multipotent, capable of differentiating into calponin-expressing smooth muscle cells and CD31+CD144+vWF+I-CAM1+ endothelial cells. These endothelial cells were capable of 20 population doublings, formed tube-like structures, imported acetylated low-density lipoprotein, and maintained a dynamic barrier function. This study provides a rapid and efficient method for production of hPSC-derived endothelial progenitors and endothelial cells and identifies WNT/β-catenin signaling as a primary regulator for generating vascular cells from hPSCs.
