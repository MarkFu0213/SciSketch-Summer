Abstract: We report the properties of hybrid deposited iron pyrite (FeS2) thin films applied as the back contact interface layers of CdS/CdTe solar cells. The hybrid deposition process for FeS2 optimized in this study relies on DC magnetron sputtering of iron with simultaneous thermal evaporation of sulfur. We have fabricated solar cells incorporating CdS/CdTe window/absorber layers sputter-deposited onto commercial transparent conducting oxide coated glass and have compared the performance of devices incorporating the new FeS2/Cu/Au back contacts with that of standard devices incorporating Cu/Au back contacts. Considering our best devices of each type, the inclusion of the FeS2 thin film as a hole transport layer has improved the open circuit voltage VOC by 2.1%, reaching 817mV, and the fill-factor FF by 8.3% relative, reaching 74.7%, in comparison with devices omitting the FeS2 layer. Under standard test conditions of 100mA/cm2 simulated AM1.5G and 25°C, devices utilizing the FeS2 hole transport layer have shown a conversion efficiency η as high as 13.3% – a relative increase in η of ~10% over our current laboratory standard back contact. The attained FF exceeds previous results for high efficiency sputter-deposited CdS/CdTe solar cells.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) is seen today as a key technology to reduce the existing gap between energy demand and energy supply in many energy systems. There are, currently, three well known methods to store thermal energy and they are: sensible heat storage (SHS), latent heat storage (LHT) and thermochemical heat storage. Every method has its own thermophysical requirements for the mediums of storage, such as thermal stability, high enthalpy of phase change or reaction, high heat capacity and suitable temperature of the thermal phenomenon for a respective application, among others. In this regard, the composition of materials usually needs to be modified in order to improve their performance or to reach a determined requirement. As a consequence, the costs of potential TES materials to be applied in renewable energy systems are too high to compete with traditional systems using fossil fuels. On the other hand, several wastes and by-products from the non-metallic mining, such as salt hydrates and double salts, are available without any application but accumulating in the mining sites. This is the case for astrakanite (Na2SO4·MgSO4·4H2O) and lithium carnallite (LiCl·MgCl2·7H2O) with no current application, and potassium carnallite (KCl·MgCl2·6H2O) used as a supplementary raw material to obtain KCl. Since the costs of these materials are close to zero, they were characterized as TES materials taking into account the properties required for the three methods of storage. Results showed that astrakanite and potassium carnallite have potential to be applied as thermochemical material at low-medium temperature (<300°C). Also, a dehydrated product obtained from astrakanite showed potential to be applied as phase change material (PCM) at high temperature, from 550°C to 750°C. Nevertheless, lithium carnallite did not show potential to be applied as TES material due to it low thermal stability, presenting partial decomposition below 200°C.

Abstract: Efficiency imaging of solar cells means to know which region of an inhomogeneous cell contributes by which degree to the efficiency at maximum power point of the cell. This knowledge allows us to judge how strong certain defect regions influence the efficiency of the whole cell. Efficiency imaging can be performed based on dark lock-in thermography (DLIT) imaging within the model of independent diodes, or based on illuminated lock-in thermography (ILIT), which does not assume any cell model. Moreover, by 2-dimensional finite element simulation of the cell based on DLIT results, an efficiency image can be obtained, which takes into account the distributed nature of the series resistance. In this contribution these three methods are applied to one and the same multicrystalline cell containing ohmic shunts and the results are compared to each other. Conclusions to the accuracy of solely DLIT-based efficiency imaging are drawn.

Abstract: The exact role of malignant ascites in the development of intraperitoneal ovarian cancer metastases remains unclear. In this report we sought to establish if ascites can determine the efficiency of transmesothelial invasion of ovarian cancer cells, and, if so, whether the fluid generated by highly aggressive serous and undifferentiated tumors will promote the invasion more effectively than ascites from less aggressive clear cell and endometrioid cancers. The study showed that the invasion of ovarian cancer cells (SKOV-3 and primary cancer cells) across monolayered peritoneal mesothelial cells was elevated upon mesothelial cell exposure to fluid produced by serous and undifferentiated cancers, as compared with cells subjected to ascites from clear cell and endometrioid tumors. This effect coincided with decreased mesothelial expression of junctional proteins: connexin 43, E-cadherin, occludin, and desmoglein. Moreover, it was accompanied by transforming growth factor β1-dependent overproduction of reactive oxygen species by these cells. The activity of ascites from serous and undifferentiated tumors was mediated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor κB. When the mesothelial cells were protected against oxidative stress, both deterioration of junctional proteins and intensification of cancer cell invasion in response to ascites from serous and undifferentiated tumors were effectively prevented. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the high aggressiveness of some histotypes of ovarian cancer may be related to the ability of malignant ascites generated by these cells to oxidative stress-dependent impairment of mesothelial cell integrity and the resulting increase in their transmesothelial invasion.

Abstract: Pathophysiological conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are reportedly associated to over-activation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). Therefore, modulation of the ECS offers potential therapeutic benefits on those diseases. GPR55, the receptor for L-α-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) that has also affinity for various cannabinoid ligands, is distributed at the central and peripheral level and it is involved in several physiological processes. This review summarizes the localization and role of GPR55 in tissues that are crucial for the regulation of glucose metabolism, and provides an update on its contribution in obesity and insulin resistance. Finally, the therapeutic potential of targeting the GPR55 receptor is also discussed.

Abstract: Fast and slow boron-oxygen related degradation in p-type Czochralski silicon is often attributed to two separate defects due to the different time constants and the determination of different capture cross section ratios (k). However, recent work has suggested the possible involvement of a single defect [1], [2]. This study reviews recent evidence, and provides further evidence/analysis to demonstrate the involvement of a single defect, in four key areas: 1) Identical recombination properties in the fast and slow timescales [1]; 2) The ability to describe a multi-stage degradation of carrier lifetime with a single recombination active defect [1]; 3) The possible involvement of interstitial iron in accounting for higher apparent capture cross-section ratios during early stages of boron-oxygen related degradation and recombination with a high capture cross-section ratio remaining after permanent deactivation; 4) The ability to modulate the fraction of fast and slow degradation by thermal annealing without modulating the total extent of degradation or recombination properties [2]. A revised parameterisation of the B-O related recombination is also presented, which suggests a stronger influence of acceptor-level related recombination than has been previously reported.

Abstract: The objective of this research was to develop a high emissivity coating on the low thermal conductive insulation for reusable thermal protection system. The design principles including high emissivity, match of the coefficients of thermal expansion and excellent high temperature stability were proposed for the first time. A novel WSi2-Si-glass hybrid coating with optimized composition was successfully prepared on fibrous ZrO2 ceramic insulation by slurry dipping and subsequent high temperature rapid sintering method. The total emissivity of the as-prepared coating is up to 0.92 in wavelength of 0.3–2.5µm. After oxidation at 1673K for 100h and 1773K for 20h, the total emissivity values of the coatings are still as high as 0.89 and 0.87. A competitive mechanism between the “defects formation” caused by aging stress, the CTE mismatch stress and the volatilization of low melting point oxides and the “defects healing” resulted from self–healing phases during the different oxidizing conditions was discussed.

Abstract: During production, solar cells undergo significant thermomechanical loadings that lead to permanent deformations before being laminated in photovoltaic (PV) modules. One of these thermomechanical production processes is cofiring. In this work, the permanent deformation of solar cells after the cofiring process was investigated. The experimental measurements revealed a great scatter in the measured deflection at the deformed edges of the polycrystalline silicon solar cells after the cofiring process. A finite element (FE) framework was developed to investigate factors contributing to this scatter. The framework predicts the multistable response of the solar cell to the thermomechanical loading of the cofiring process. It accounts for the uncertainties arising from the heterogeneity of the polycrystalline silicon layer (grain orientations and non-uniform grain sizes) and uncertainties regarding the layer thicknesses of the silicon and aluminum paste. Employing the developed framework in a Monte-Carlo simulation the relative significance of the mentioned uncertainties on the deflection at the solar cell edge after the cofiring process was analyzed. Numerical results for a commercially produced polycrystalline silicon solar cell were compared with an analytical model and validated with experimental measurements.

Role of leishmanial acidocalcisomal pyrophosphatase in the cAMP homeostasis in phagolysosome conditions required for intra-macrophage survival,

Abstract: Exposure of Leishmania donovani to macrophage phagolysosome conditions (PC) (37°C and pH 5.5) led to increased intracellular cAMP and cAMP-mediated responses, which help in intra-macrophage survival pre-requisite for infectivity. In the absence of typical orthologs for G-proteins and G-protein coupled receptors, we sought to study the precise mechanisms for positive modulation of cAMP production during exposure to PC. Amongst two promastigote-stage specific membrane bound receptor adenylate cyclases (LdRAC-A and LdRAC-B), LdRAC-A appeared to function as a major cAMP generator following PC exposure. Pyrophosphate (PPi), an energy storage compound as well as a by-product of cAMP biosynthesis by adenylate cyclise, was found to be decreased following PC exposure. This may be due to microtubule and microfilament-driven translocation of acidocalcisomes near plasma membrane vicinity with concomitant increase of acidocalcisome membrane pyrophosphatase (LdV-H+PPase) and acidocalcisomal soluble pyrophosphatase (LdVSP1). Episomal over-expression and conditional silencing demonstrated regulatory role of V-H+PPase on cAMP trigger and consequent induction of resistance to macrophage-derived pro-oxidants and parasite killing. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis revealed possible co-localization of LdV-H+PPase and LdRAC-A during PC exposure. Collectively, these results suggest that translocation of acidocalcisome in membrane vicinity functions as a trigger for LdRAC-A-driven cAMP generation through depletion of PPi pool by LdV-H+PPase.

Abstract: Organometallic halide perovskite solar cells have considerable potential to be manufactured as low-cost and visible-light-semitransparent modules by reducing the thickness of the perovskite films for building-integrated photovoltaics. However, perovskite films often suffer from voids and roughness, inducing depressed photovoltaic performance, and this problem is even more severe for thinner perovskite films. Herein, a poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) additive is incorporated into CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solutions to control the crystal growth of a visible-light-semitransparent perovskite layer (thickness: ~150nm) in a one-step deposition process. The characterization results show that the coverage and smoothness of the perovskite films can be significantly improved, and the perovskite crystal boundaries are also reduced by introducing a moderate amount of PVDF-HFP. When the precursor solution containing 12mg/mL PVDF-HFP, the highest power conversion efficiencies of 10.6% and 8.8% (backward scan) is achieved for the photovoltaic devices with 80 and 20nm-thick Au electrode, respectively, which is over 30% higher than that of the PVDF-HFP-free control. Time-resolved photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterizations further demonstrate that the PVDF-HFP additive can improve the carrier lifetimes and reduce the charge transfer resistance, which contributes to the enhanced photovoltaic performance. Thus, we propose a strategy specific to a high-quality visible-light-semitransparent perovskite layer and for high-performance perovskite solar-cell preparation.

Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to mitigate the supercooling and improve the heat release performance of erythritol (ET) as phase change material for thermal energy storage using the method of encapsulation and doping additives. The capsules containing ET, thickening and nucleating agent were prepared and various characterization techniques were employed to investigate the structure and thermo-physical properties of the composite, especially the supercooling inhibition and exothermicity improvement. Experimental results reveal that capsulation and adding thickening and nucleating agents have positive influence on the supercooling elimination, heat discharging ability improvement and thermal stability enhancement. The optimal capsules, with the maximal ET mass percentage of 59.2%, melt at 121.2°C and freeze at 106.4°C with the latent heat of 213.3J/g and 206.9J/g, respectively. Due to the improved crystallization kinetics, the degree of supercooling decreased by 83.6% as well as the heat release ratio increased by 52.2% compared to those of pristine ET. The as-prepared capsules have obvious core-shell structure, good compatibility between the shell and core materials. The thermal conductivity is 0.84W/mK, increased by 29.2% than that of pristine ET. The results of accelerated thermal cycling test indicate that the supercooling, heat release ability and thermal reliability of encapsulated ET changed imperceptibly. In total, the technology of capsulation and adding thickening and nucleating agents can be used to suppress the supercooling and improve the thermal behavior of ET.

Abstract: Aberrant expression of miR-130a is usually found in cancer studies; however, the role of miR-130a has seldom been reported in glioma. We explored miR-130a’s function and the underlying mechanism in glioma. It was found that miR-130a expression was significantly down-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-130a decreased glioma cell growth and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. We identified the oncogene HMGB2 as a downstream target of miR-130a by using luciferase and western blot assays. Knockdown of HMGB2 mimicked the effect of miR-130a in glioma cells. Taken together, our study demonstrate that miR-130a may function as a tumor suppressor in glioma and suggest that miR-130a is a potential therapeutic target for glioma patients.

Abstract: The main hindrances which preclude the commercial application of hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells is their thermodynamic instability and fast environmental degradation. Fully inorganic halide perovskites are still far from the MAPbI3 record power conversion efficiency, but they are significantly more stable. In this work, a significant current increase in the absorbing CsPbBr3 halide perovskite layer is measured by conductive Scanning Probe Microscopy (c-SPM) after thermal ageing without visible structural degradation. Enhanced local photocurrent along grain boundaries and triple junctions is observed by c-SPM. These effects are accompanied by the appearance of downward band bending along grain boundaries as measured by Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy. It is suggested that the resulting built in electric field effectively acts to facilitate splitting of photogenerated electron-hole pairs at grain boundaries by attracting electrons and repelling holes. The fact of current increase, even though significantly smaller in amplitude, is further confirmed by macroscopic measurements on a complete cell, which may arise from improvement of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsPbBr3 interfaces upon thermal ageing. These measurements provide advanced understanding of how nanoscale localized structure and function evolve in time and upon thermal ageing. These findings proved further impetus for increasing inorganic halide perovskites power conversion efficiency up to levels sufficient for practical applications.

Abstract: It was shown recently that previous approaches for quantitative luminescence image evaluation based on the model of independent diodes inevitably lead to erroneous results for imaging saturation current densities. However, the pioneering work of Fuyuki on electroluminescence imaging of solar cells was not based on this model. There it was claimed that the calibration constant of the local luminescence signal should be proportional to the local effective diffusion length. With increasing diffusion length, however, the luminescence reaches a saturation value. Recently a simple formula for the calibration constant was proposed, which describes both the proportionality for small diffusion lengths and the saturation property for large ones. While this non-linear Fuyuki PL evaluation method was previously only applied to standard BSF cells, in this work it is applied to modern multicrystalline PERC cells processed from different high performance multicrystalline silicon materials. The results are compared to that of dark lock-in thermography (DLIT) and Laplacian PL investigations of these cells. It is found that saturation current density images obtained from the alternative luminescence evaluation methods are close to that based on DLIT in low lifetime regions, but show a much better spatial resolution. In high lifetime regions, however, this alternative PL evaluation is generally less reliable than DLIT. These alternative kinds of luminescence image evaluation may replace previous approaches of quantitative PL evaluation based on the model of independent diodes.

Abstract: It has been well-known that over activation of NF-κB has close relationship with hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the complete and exact underlying molecular pathways and mechanisms still remain not fully understood. By manipulating NF-κB activity with its recognized activator TNFα and using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq techniques, this study identified 699 NF-κB direct target genes (DTGs) in a widely used HCC cell line, HepG2, including 399 activated and 300 repressed genes. In these NF-κB DTGs, 216 genes (126 activated and 90 repressed genes) are among the current HCC gene signature. In comparison with NF-κB target genes identified in LPS-induced THP-1 and TNFα-induced HeLa cells, only limited numbers (24–46) of genes were shared by the two cell lines, indicating the HCC specificity of identified genes. Functional annotation revealed that NF-κB DTGs in HepG2 cell are mainly related with many typical NF-κB-related biological processes including immune system process, response to stress, response to stimulus, defense response, and cell death, and signaling pathways of MAPK, TNF, TGF-beta, Chemokine, NF-kappa B, and Toll-like receptor. Some NF-κB DTGs are also involved in Hepatitis C and B pathways. It was found that 82 NF-κB DTGs code secretory proteins, which include CCL2 and DKK1 that have already been used as HCC markers. Finally, the NF-κB DTGs were further confirmed by detecting the NF-κB binding and expression of 14 genes with ChIP-PCR and RT-PCR. This study thus provides a useful NF-κB DTG list for future studies of NF-κB-related molecular mechanisms and theranostic biomarkers of HCC.

Abstract: Antimony (Sb) is one of the most prevalent heavy metals and frequently leads to biological toxicity. Although autophagy is believed to be involved in metal-associated cytotoxicity, there is no evidence of its involvement following exposure. Moreover, the underlying mechanism of autophagy remains unclear. In this study, treatment with antimony trichloride caused autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner in A549 cells but did not affect the level of Atg5 or Atg7 mRNA expression. Furthermore, Sb enhanced autophagic flux while upregulating p62 gene and protein levels. The classic mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is not involved in Sb-induced autophagy. However, Sb-induced autophagy and the upregulation of p62 were inhibited by treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that the inhibition of autophagy protected A549 cells from a loss of cell viability, while the activation of autophagy by rapamycin had the opposite effect. These data suggest that reactive oxygen species-dependent autophagy mediates Sb-stimulated cell viability loss in A549 cells.

Abstract: Bleomycin (BLM) is a cancer chemotherapeutic agent that is used in the treatment of several types of tumours. The cytotoxicity of three BLM analogues, BLM Z, 6′-deoxy-BLM Z and zorbamycin (ZBM), was determined in human HeLa cells in comparison with BLM. It was found that the IC50 values were 2.9μM for 6′-deoxy-BLM Z, 3.2μM for BLM Z, 4.4μM for BLM and 7.9μM for ZBM in HeLa cells. Using next-generation Illumina DNA sequencing techniques, the genome-wide cleavage of DNA by the BLM analogues was determined in human HeLa cells and compared with BLM. It was ascertained that BLM, 6′-deoxy-BLM Z and ZBM preferentially cleaved at the transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes in human cells. The degree of preferential cleavage at the transcription start sites was quantified and an inverse correlation with the IC50 values was observed. This indicated that the degree of preferential cleavage at transcription start sites is an important component in determining the cytotoxicity of BLM analogues.

Abstract: A novel idea was presented by using patterned honeycomb-like ZnO cavities to enhance the light harvesting of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells in a broadband wavelength range. Large-scale patterned honeycomb-like ZnO cavities were fabricated through the versatile colloidal lithograhpy technique combined with the subsquent hydrothermal growth reaction. The growth mechanism was proposed based on the structural evolution of the patterned ZnO cavities. By introducing the patterned honeycomb-like ZnO cavities into CIGS solar cells, the performances of the device can be remarkabley improved due to the enhanced light harvesting. Photovoltaic device with a standard soda lime glass (SLG)/Mo/CIGS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO/ZnO cavities/Ag grid structure exhibited a maximum power conversion efficiency of 11.4% under the standard AM 1.5 global illumination with a light intensity of 100mW/cm2. An improvement of over 9.0% in the short-circuit photocurrent density and a 10.6% enhancement in the energy conversion efficiency were achieved compared with the standard reference device without ZnO cavities. More importantly, the device with patterned ZnO cavities exhibited omnidirectional behavior within a wide incident angle range. The enhancement of light harvesting is originating from the novel “negative” configuration of patterned ZnO cavities, which can realize high-efficient light trapping by multiple scattering and light coupling.

Abstract: InN direct band gap semiconductor is a promising material in the nitride family for high power and high frequency optoelectronic devices. However, the reports on photo-sensing ability of the material are limited with photoresponsivity < 1A/W only. Here, we report fast photoresponse from high quality molecular beam epitaxy grown InN islands delivering photoresponsivity of 13.5A/W, about 30 times higher than the recently reported InN based photodetector operating in the near infrared spectral range. The ultra-broadband response with high photoresponsivity from visible to near infrared spectral range is experimentally demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the working of a photodetector having fast response (38μs) and high photo detectivity (5.5 × 1010W-1Hz1/2cm) operating at room temperature. The device yields a quiet prompt saturation and decay under periodic illumination which demonstrate excellent stability and reliability of the device with switching time. The sub-linear dependent photocurrent on the bias voltage and incident power offers good tunability for multipurpose applications. This is the first report on ultra-broadband spectral range of InN based photodetectors that open up opportunities for developing the next generation high efficiency photodetectors.

Abstract: Different approaches have been studied to evaluate the efficiency of the photoactive layer in a photochromic (PC) device. The studied device combines materials typically used in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and an electrochromic (EC) layer of WO3. First, we examine if the dye could be attached directly to the EC layer forming an efficient photoactive layer to colour the PC device. Further, different TiO2 layers have been coated on the EC layer to enhance dye loading and two different sol-gel TiO2 layers and the post-treatment of the EC layer with a titanium(IV) chloride tetrahydrofuran complex have been studied. The dye loading of different photoactive layers and their efficiencies in DSSC have been evaluated and discussed with regard to the performance of the PC devices. The results confirmed that the dye could be attached to the WO3 layer, but that the voltage of the DSSC is too low to colour the device. To realize a functioning PC device, the addition of TiO2 is necessary. The best performance (deep and fast colouration) is obtained for a PC device with a TiO2 sol-gel layer; the solar transmittance of the PC device decreases from 57% to 7.5% in under three minutes. According to our knowledge, this is the first study of the impact of the photoactive layer on the photochromic glazing's response.

Abstract: With the advancement in technology, the size of devices goes on decreasing consistently. The decrease in the size has improved the efficiency and life time of devices. Quantum dots (QDs) have played a pivotal role in miniaturization of devices shrinking their dimension from micro to nano level. Quantum dots find applications in a variety of disciplines viz. medicine, quantum computers, light emitting diodes and solar cells etc. Synthesis and basic understanding of quantum dots have been progressing at an incredible pace making these materials available for various applications. In this paper, we have tried to provide an insight to the origin of quantum dots and their properties. We have discussed QDs synthesis focusing particularly on chalcogenide semiconducting materials to inspect their synthesis, structural and optical properties and their current applications. The attracting future interest applications of QDs across a broad range of fields, have strove us to put the review on chalcogenide semiconducting QDs both comprehensive and convenient to entrants as well as established researchers in this area.

Abstract: Myristyl alcohol (MA)/metal foam composite phase change materials (CPCMs) were fabricated by vacuum melting infiltration. MA was used as the phase change material (PCM) and the metal foam was used as skeleton. Nickel foam and copper foam were both employed for comparison. Furthermore, effects of pore size of metal foam on thermal performances were analyzed. Thermal properties, including differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) test results and thermogravimetry analyzer results (TGA) were investigated and recorded. Compared with latent heat of pure MA, the latent heat of CPCMs for the melting process decreased by 3–29%. TGA results showed that the composites have good thermal stability. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT–IR) and X–ray diffractometer (XRD) were used to determine chemical and crystalloid structure of the composites, respectively. Microstructures of the composites were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the results indicated that the PCM was well absorbed by the metal foam. Thermal conductivity of the composites was measured by thermal conductivity meter (TCM), and the outcome proved that MA/metal foam composites have an improved thermal conductivity.

Abstract: Indoor light control using thermotropic materials is an active area of research. While active materials are available to switch transmittance with temperature, large area heaters with desired transparency are not easily affordable. In this paper, the fabrication of thermochromic devices using inexpensive Sn mesh electrodes (5Ω/□, transmission, 80%) produced by crackle lithography with hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) as active material is reported. When laminated and coated on the inner surface of a PET window (8×8cm2), the mesh served as a transparent heater to cause gelation in HPMC at ~40°C to switch from water-clear transparency to paper-white opaqueness with 1mm thickness of the active layer. The power consumption was only 0.2W/cm2. Few drops of a color ink produced interesting effects in this smart window prototype.

Abstract: In this work we present a solar cell structure where the concept of intermediate band is exploited by a high energy barrier AlGaAs material with embedded InAs-based quantum dots via a multistep growth approach. In this way the intrinsic issues related to different surface kinetics of involved species (Ga, In and Al adatoms) and affecting crystal quality are successfully overcome. With respect to energy band engineering of the cell, this growth approach introduces a two-dimensional quaternary layer and consequently an additional energy band, between the host junction and the dot energy levels. This band results strongly related to the quantum dot states by thermal transferring and inter-level filling processes. Moreover, low temperature (up to 100K) photocurrent generation via additional infrared absorption is promoted by the employed band engineering, thus representing an effective method to extend intermediate band solar cell design flexibility.

Abstract: A new flame retardance strategy for shape stabilized phase change materials (SSPCMs) by surface coating was proposed. The coating was composed of acrylic resin, expandable graphite (EG) and/or red phosphorous (RP). The flame retardant effects of surface coatings on SSPCMs were evaluated by limiting oxygen index (LOI) determination, vertical burning test, cone calorimeter test, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transfer infrared spectrometry (TGA-FTIR). The results showed that surface coated SSPCMs exhibited very good flame retardance, with the LOI values increasing to 35.9vol% and 36.9vol%, respectively, from 18.7vol%. And UL-94 V0 level was achieved at the vertical burning test. In contrast, the same loading of EG and/or RP contributed little to flame retardance of SSPCMs when they were melt-blended into the bulk. The cone calorimeter test revealed that peak heat release rates (PHRR) of surface coated SSPCMs decreased by 60%, and the burning processes prolonged significantly. The flame retardant mechanism of surface coating was investigated using TGA-FTIR. The results showed that EG played a crucial role. When samples were exposed to flame, EG expanded and absorbed evaporated paraffin and heat at the same time so that the combustibles and temperature were decreased.

Abstract: We report on a high-performance intermediate band solar cell (IBSC) based on Cr-doped ZnTe (ZnTe:Cr) fabricated using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. Chromium (Cr) was uniformly distributed in the ZnTe:Cr thin film with an atomic concentration of about 3.5%, and the ZnTe:Cr thin film showed p-type electrical conductivity. The ZnTe:Cr thin film had higher absorption coefficients than those of undoped ZnTe films in the photon energy range below band gap of ZnTe (2.2eV). The enhanced absorption coefficients of the ZnTe:Cr thin film were attributed to the photoionization energy between Cr2+ and Cr+ (Cr2+ ⇌ Cr+), which acted as the IB to absorb photons below the bandgap of ZnTe (2.2eV). Illumination with an AM 1.5G solar spectrum on the ZnTe:Cr IBSC generated a large short circuit current of 21.18mA/cm2, an open circuit voltage of 0.48V, and a fill factor of 0.58, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.9%, the highest reported PCE in an IBSC based on impurity-doped ZnTe.

Abstract: Transcription-coupled processes such as capping, splicing, and cleavage/polyadenylation participate in the journey from genes to proteins. Although they are traditionally thought to serve only as steps in the generation of mature mRNAs, a synthesis of available data indicates that these processes could also act as a driving force for the evolution of eukaryotic genes. A theoretical framework for how mRNA-associated processes may shape gene structure and expression has recently been proposed. Factors that promote splicing and cleavage/polyadenylation in this framework compete for access to overlapping or neighboring signals throughout the transcription cycle. These antagonistic interactions allow mechanisms for intron gain and splice site recognition as well as common trends in eukaryotic gene structure and expression to be coherently integrated. Here, I extend this framework further. Observations that largely (but not exclusively) revolve around the formation of DNA-RNA hybrid structures, called R loops, and promoter directionality are integrated. Additionally, the interplay between splicing factors and cleavage/polyadenylation factors is theorized to also affect the formation of intragenic DNA double-stranded breaks thereby contributing to intron loss. The most notable prediction in this proposition is that RNA molecules can mediate intron loss by serving as a template to repair DNA double-stranded breaks. The framework presented here leverages a vast body of empirical observations, logically extending previous suggestions, and generating verifiable predictions to further substantiate the view that the intracellular environment plays an active role in shaping the structure and the expression of eukaryotic genes.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality worldwide. Aberrant sialylation is crucially involved in the progression of various types of cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been broadly studied in cancer. MicroRNA-33a (miR-33a) and Has-let-7e (let-7e) are non-coding RNA that can reduce cell motility and viability in cancer. In this study, miR-33a and let-7e levels were confirmed to be significantly down-regulated in CRC samples (n=32) and drug resistant cell line (HCT-8/5-FU) compared with those in the matched adjacent tissues and drug sensitivity cell line (HCT-8). ST8SIA1 was highly expressed in CRC tissues and HCT-8/5-FU cells, which was negatively correlated with miR-33a/let-7e expression. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that both miR-33a and let-7e bound to the 3'-untranslated (3'-UTR) region of ST8SIA1. Inhibiting miR-33a/let-7e expression in CRC cells increased endogenous ST8SIA1 mRNA and protein levels. MiR-33a/let-7e knockdown promoted chemoresistance, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. Whereas, ectopic expression of miR-33a/let-7e suppressed chemoresistance, proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis in CRC cell lines. ST8SIA1 knockdown mimicked the tumor suppressive effect of miR-33a/let-7e on CRC cells, while restoration of ST8SIA1 abolished the tumor suppressive effect of miR-33a/let-7e on CRC cells. Taken together, altered expression of miR-33a/let-7e was correlated with ST8SIA1 level, which might contribute to CRC progression. The miR-33a/let-7e-ST8SIA1 axis could be a therapeutic target for CRC patients.

Abstract: We have introduced centrifugally-cast thin-film formation technique to 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) formed through a liquid based exfoliation method. The film-formation technique has evidenced a growth of uniform and homogeneous thin-films of single or a-few-layered MoS2; the thin-films have been introduced as a charge-transport layer in perovskite solar cells. From scanning tunneling spectroscopy and thereof the density of states of the 2D semiconductor, we have observed that the band-edges of MoS2 formed a type-II band-alignment with the commonly-used organic-inorganic lead halide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite when the 2D material was subjected to an ozone-treatment. We thereafter formed p–i–n heterojunction planar perovskite solar cells with the thin-film of 2H-MoS2 so that charge separation can occur at the MoS2|perovskite interface. In this work, we also report device characteristics and impedance spectroscopy of the heterojunctions, which were optimized for a small series-resistance and a large shunt-resistance.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to enhance the heat storage and mass transfer performances of mesoporous materials by adding a hygroscopic salt. Silica-gel, alumina, and bentonite were chosen as supports of 15wt% of calcium chloride. Comparison between the three series of composites was done by analyzing the impact of the salt addition on the physico-chemical and sorption properties of the three host matrixes. Moreover, the water sorption/desorption kinetics on the different composites under operating conditions, close to those of heat pump application, has been studied. The thermal behavior of the composite materials was examined by TG/DSC analysis. The addition of calcium chloride increased the quantity of sorbed water and released heat. The composite silica gel/CaCl2 showed the highest sorption capacity (0.27gH2Ogsample−1) accompanied with the highest heat storage (746Jgsample−1). The activation energy determined for the desorption process was following the silica-gel/CaCl2 < bentonite/CaCl2 < alumina/CaCl2 order, opposite to the pore size of the various composites, that was the larger for silica-gel based materials. Finally, the experimental results of rehydration were fitted with kinetics model in order to describe the kinetics of water vapor adsorption of the three mesoporous composites. Moreover, using the experimental data of rehydration a kinetic model was applied to describe water vapor diffusion in the three mesoporous composites.

Abstract: Lectins are multidomain proteins that specifically recognize various carbohydrates. The structural characterization of these molecules is crucial in understanding their function and activity in systems and organisms. Most cancer cells exhibit changes in glycosylation patterns, and lectins may be able to recognize these changes. In this work, Dioclea lasiocarpa seed lectin (DLL) was structurally characterized. The lectin presented a high degree of similarity with other lectins isolated from legumes, presenting a jelly roll motif and a metal-binding site stabilizing the carbohydrate-recognition domain. DLL demonstrated differential interactions with carbohydrates, depending on type of glycosidic linkage present in ligands. As observed by the reduction of cell viability in C6 cells, DLL showed strong antiglioma activity by mechanisms involving activation of caspase 3.

Abstract: We report on a degradation of the electronic properties of uncompensated seed-end n-type (phosphorus-doped) Czochralski silicon wafers under light soaking. We unambiguously demonstrate that this degradation is related to the formation and/or activation of a bulk defect under illumination. We bring general information about its activation/formation (illumination intensities, spatial distribution) as well as deactivation features. We show that this defect can be permanently suppressed in a few seconds at high temperatures (850°C). Conversely annealing at low temperature (200°C) was found to lead only to a temporary deactivation, the defect being reactivated/reformed after subsequent illumination. As a consequence, this defect could be harmful to solar cell technologies processed at low temperature, such as amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction (SHJ). The impact of the defect on SHJ cells performances is experimentally assessed at device level. Eventually the possible nature of the defect is discussed in the light of all collected data.

Abstract: The thermal stability of the Al/NbMoN/NbMoON/SiO2 solar selective absorbing coatings is investigated to determine its potential applications in concentrated solar power (CSP). The coatings are deposited on stainless steel (SS) substrate by using magnetron reactive sputtering method, which exhibit high solar absorptance (αs = 0.948) and low thermal emittance (ε = 0.11, at 400°C). The coatings are aged (in vacuum and air) at different temperatures and time durations. The aging effect is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Vis.-IR spectroscopy. There is no significant change in surface morphology and spectral selectivity (performance criterion (PC) value is 0.021) of the coating after aging at 500°C for 240h in vacuum. The coatings also keep high spectral selectivity (PC = 0.034) after aging at 450°C for 200h in air. Unfortunately, the value of PC increases to 0.161 when the coating is aged at the temperature of 500°C for 200h in air, which is attributed to diffusion and oxidation in the absorbing layers and degradation of the dense surface morphology and structure, as evidenced by XRD and SEM analysis. These results indicate that the Al/NbMoN/NbMoON/SiO2 coatings is stable up to 500°C in vacuum and below 450°C in air, which means enough thermal stability for potential applications in parabolic trough CSP.

Multiple pathways for permanent deactivation of boron-oxygen defects in p-type silicon,

Abstract: In this work, it is shown that there are at least two separate pathways for the permanent deactivation of boron-oxygen defects – a purely thermal pathway involving the dissociation of defect precursors, and another mechanism based on passivation of the fully-formed defect during an illuminated annealing process (regeneration). Based on investigations on fired and non-fired p-type Czochralski silicon wafers, a thermal reduction in the net concentration of BO defects is confirmed and found to be caused by rapid cooling following a belt-furnace firing process. This thermal deactivation occurs independently of any subsequent permanent deactivation induced by illuminated annealing and is likely related to the dissociation of the defect and subsequent loss of defect precursors to other species. Further, by varying the surface dielectric present on the wafers during a rapid thermal process, it is demonstrated that in the absence of hydrogen in the wafer bulk, applying an illuminated annealing process does not result in any significant permanent deactivation of defects. In contrast, thermal deactivation occurs independently of the presence of hydrogen in the wafer bulk. This demonstrates that permanent deactivation via the thermal pathway and that via the illuminated annealing (regeneration) pathway occur independently of each other and have different underlying mechanisms. The implications of multiple pathways for permanent deactivation are discussed and the well-known three-state model is revisited in light of this information. A fourth state to represent the end point of thermal deactivation (State D) is proposed for more accurate modelling of BO defect kinetics.

Abstract: Paraffin wax-graphite foam (P-wax/G-foam) composite was fabricated by using low cost small scale process aiming to produce a stable phase change material with enhanced thermal transport. Its thermophysical properties such as thermal diffusivity, specific heat and thermal conductivity were examined as a function of temperature. The thermal conductivity of the P-wax/G-foam composite in both solid (2.6W/mK) and liquid (1.8W/mK) phases is by a factor of ≈ 11 (980%) higher than that of pristine paraffin wax in solid (0.24W/mK) and by a factor of ≈ 16 (1530%) in liquid (0.11W/mK) phases, respectively. This is due to both the G-foam morphology and graphitic content, allowing a rapid heat transfer to the P-wax. The thermal conductivity behaviour of the composite is also discussed in term of a theoretical model in which the G-foam is described by a 3D interpenetrating matrix for the P-wax. The model shows the self-consistency of all the measured data. The obtained results demonstrated that the stable P-wax/G-foam composite is a promising material for various thermal energy storage applications such as building and vehicle heating and cooling, solar thermal harvesting, and thermal management of electrochemical energy storage and electronic devices.

Abstract: Advanced energy-efficient windows have been widely investigated due to the special role of windows among building envelopes. Here, we propose an idea of dynamic management of both solar radiation and long-wave thermal radiation. A window based on this idea can be named as a dual-intelligent window, which blocks the solar radiation as well as emits little long-wave thermal radiation to the indoor side during hot daytime and cools the room by dissipating heat from the indoor side to the outdoor side through radiative heat transfer at cool nights. Based on the properties of thermochromic vanadium dioxide (VO2), it was found that a dual-intelligent window can be accomplished by pasting the VO2 film onto the indoor side of the window. The energy performance of this conceptual dual-intelligent window was numerically simulated and compared with low-emissivity window and traditional VO2 window where the VO2 film is on the outdoor side. The results show that the window with low emissivity cannot reduce the energy consumption for cooling due to the lack of the ability of regulating the long-wave thermal radiation. The dual-intelligent window surpasses the traditional intelligent VO2 windows due to the fact that the application of the dual-intelligent window can reduce cooling energy by 21.7% compared with the traditional intelligent window. This improvement of dual-intelligent window emphases the advantages of dynamically regulating solar and long-wave radiations simultaneously.

Abstract: In this work we present an optimization of the post-deposition annealing, in Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin film solar cells, applied at different stages of the solar cell preparation, namely, bare CZTS absorber, CZTS/CdS heterojunction and CZTS/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO complete solar cell. We performed current-density measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman scattering, photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies to enlighten the mechanisms by which solar cells performance improvement comes about. As a result, we concluded that the optimum post-deposition annealing for CZTS is at 300°C for 15min and at atmospheric pressure. The highest efficiency gain was obtained when the absorber layer composition is close to the ideal one and when a single annealing step is performed on complete solar cells, where, we obtained efficiency improvements from below 1% to over 6.6%. Despite the observed improvement in device performance for annealing at intermediate stages it is, however, less pronounced than for full cell annealing. In this process we demonstrate very substantial cell performance improvements. XRD results show a shift of all Bragg peaks to lower diffraction angle values, after post-deposition annealing. Also, the intensity of the peaks decreases and their full width at half maximum increases. PL measurements show that, post-deposition annealing, leads to a clear reduction of the non-radiative recombination channels and that the electronic structure is dominated by fluctuating potentials. XPS measurements reveal an interdiffusion of Cu, Zn and possibly Cd across the interface between buffer and CZTS absorber layers as the source of the significant observed cell performance enhancement.

Abstract: In this work, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been employed to prepare high-mobility H-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:H) films. Hydrogen doping was achieved by interleaving the ZnO ALD cycles with H2 plasma treatments. It has been shown that doping with H2 plasma offers key advantages over traditional doping by Al and B, and enables a high mobility value up to 47cm2/Vs and a resistivity of 1.8 mΩcm. By proper choice of a deposition regime where there is a strong competition between film growth and film etching by the H2 plasma treatment, a strongly enhanced grain size and hence increased carrier mobility with respect to undoped ZnO can be obtained. The successful incorporation of a significant amount of H from the H2 plasma has been demonstrated, and insights into the mobility-limiting scatter mechanisms have been obtained from temperature-dependent Hall measurements. A comparison with conventional TCOs has been made in terms of optoelectronic properties, and it has been shown that high-mobility ZnO:H has potential for use in various configurations of silicon heterojunction solar cells and silicon-perovskite tandem cells.

Abstract: Activation of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) expressed by T cells has been linked to the bone loss associated with periodontitis. We generated PAR2 conditional-null mice and crossed these with mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the Lck proximal promoter, to produce T cell-specific PAR2-null mice in order to further study the cellular mechanism involved in periodontitis. Here we report that efficient deletion of PAR2 in thymocytes isolated from T cell-specific PAR2-null mice resulted in thymic and splenic hypoplasia and a reduction in the cells of the cortex and a loss of distinction between the cortex and the medulla of the thymus. FACS analysis confirmed significant reductions in CD4 and CD8 double negative (DN3 and DN4) sub-populations, as well as double positive and single positive T cells, in T cell-specific PAR2-null mice compared to Cre expressing PAR2 wild-type mice. The proportion of annexin V positive and propidium iodide negative cells was increased in CD4 and CD8 double negative, double positive and single positive T cells from T cell-specific PAR2-null mice. No change in the proportion of Ki67 positive cells was observed in sections of thymus from T cell-specific PAR2-null mice, suggesting that the depletion of T cell sub-populations in T cell-specific PAR2-null mice resulted from increased apoptosis rather than reduced proliferation. Together, these results demonstrate that PAR2 plays an important and previously unrecognised anti-apoptotic role in T cell development and suggest that the PAR2 conditional-null mouse will be an important resource for determining tissue and cell specific effects of PAR2.

FGF23 activates injury-primed renal fibroblasts via FGFR4-dependent signalling and enhancement of TGF-β autoinduction,

Abstract: Bone-derived fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is an important endocrine regulator of mineral homeostasis with effects transduced by cognate FGF receptor (FGFR)1-α-Klotho complexes. Circulating FGF23 levels rise precipitously in patients with kidney disease and portend worse renal and cardiovascular outcomes. De novo expression of FGF23 has been found in the heart and kidney following injury but its significance remains unclear. Studies showing that exposure to chronically high FGF23 concentrations activates hypertrophic gene programs in the cardiomyocyte has spawned intense interest in other pathological off-target effects of FGF23 excess. In the kidney, observational evidence points to a concordance of ectopic renal FGF23 expression and the activation of local transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signalling. Although we have previously shown that FGF23 activates injury-primed renal fibroblasts in vitro, our understanding of the mechanism underpinning these effects was incomplete. Here we show that in the absence of α-Klotho, FGF23 augments pro-fibrotic signalling cascades in injury-primed renal fibroblasts via activation of FGFR4 and upregulation of the calcium transporter, transient receptor potential cation channel 6. The resultant rise in intracellular calcium and production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species induced expression of NFAT responsive-genes and enhanced TGF-β1 autoinduction through non-canonical JNK-dependent pathways. Reconstitution with transmembrane α-Klotho, or its soluble ectodomain, restored classical Egr signalling and antagonised FGF23-driven myofibroblast differentiation. Thus, renal FGF23 may amplify local myofibroblast activation in injury and perpetuate pro-fibrotic signalling. These findings strengthen the rationale for exploring therapeutic inhibition of FGFR4 or restoration of α-Klotho as upstream regulators of off-target FGF23 effects.

Abstract: Genetic variations of the phosphatidylcholine transporter, ABCB4 cause several biliary diseases. The large number of reported variations makes it difficult to foresee a comprehensive study of each variation. To appreciate the reliability of in silico prediction programs, 1) we confronted them with the assessment in cell models of two ABCB4 variations (E528D and P1161S) identified in patients with low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis (LPAC); 2) we extended the confrontation to 19 variations that we had previously characterized in cellulo. Four programs (Provean, Polyphen-2, PhD-SNP and MutPred) were used to predict the degree of pathogenicity. The E528D and P1161S variants were studied in transfected HEK293 and HepG2 cells by immunofluorescence, immunoblotting and measurement of phosphatidylcholine secretion. All prediction tools qualified the P1161S variation as deleterious, but provided conflicting results for E528D. In cell models, both mutants were expressed and localized as the wild type but their activity was significantly reduced, by 48% (P1161S) and 33% (E528D). These functional defects best correlated with MutPred predictions. MutPred program also proved the most accurate to predict the pathogenicity of the 19 ABCB4 variants that we previously characterized in cell models, and the most sensitive to predict the pathogenicity of 65 additional mutations of the Human Gene Mutation Database. These results confirm the pathogenicity of E528D and P1161S variations and suggest that even a moderate decrease (by less than 50%) of phosphatidylcholine secretion can cause LPAC syndrome. They highlight the reliability of in silico prediction tools, most notably MutPred, as a first approach to predict the pathogenicity of ABCB4 variants.

Abstract: Owing to its excellent optical, electronic properties, good chemical and thermal stability, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been applied in promising energy technologies including new dye-sensitized solar cells, rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, photocatalysts and gas sensors in recent years. However, wide band gap and poor electron transporting ability of TiO2 has largely limited its application in some aspects like photocatalytic hydrogen generation and lithium ion batteries. Therefore, the modification of TiO2 is essential for improving its optical and electrical properties. Graphene (GR), a two dimensional carbon nanostructure, is an ideal material to modify TiO2 owing to its excellent electronic transport properties, exceptional thermal, and electrical conductivity. Compared to a pure TiO2 nanostructure, the conjugation of GR leads to the increase of its adsorption capacity and photocatalytic activity, and improve the electrical conductivity and Li-ion diffusion pathways. In this review, we have firstly discussed pure TiO2 nanostructures and introduced different methods for the preparation of TiO2-graphene nanohybrids (TiO2-GRNHs), and then discussed the practical applications of the TiO2-GRNHs in different energy technologies. It is expected that the continuous breakthroughs in the synthesis and modifications of TiO2-GRNHs will bring new high-performance materials with exotic properties and potential applications in emerging energy technologies.

Abstract: Extracellular matrix proteins play important roles in the development of pulmonary hypertension(pH). However, the role of Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in the development of hypoxia-induced pH is largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that COMP deficiency induced by hypoxia leads to the phenotype switching of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). The expression of COMP decreased in a chronic hypoxia rat pH model (P<0.05) and in PASMCs under hypoxia (3%O2) (P<0.05). The expressions of differentiated marker proteins reduced in the pulmonary arteries from 5 month old COMP−/− mice and in PASMCs under hypoxia or with the siRNA of COMP treatment under normoxia, but increased in PASMCs with adenovirus-increased COMP under hypoxia. The absorbance of cell counting kit-8 at 450nm and the expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and osteopontin increased in PASMCs with the siRNA of COMP under normoxia (P<0.05). PCNA and osteopontin decreased in PASMCs with adenovirus-increased COMP under hypoxia (P<0.05). Additionally, the expression of bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) was reduced in COMP−/− mice (P<0.01). Both mRNA and protein levels of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) were lower in PASMCs with the siRNA of COMP (P<0.05). The protein level of BMP2 could be reversed by adenovirus-increased COMP under hypoxia (P<0.05). These data suggest that COMP could normally have a protective role against PASMC phenotype switching and maintain BMP2/BMPR2 signaling, and these protective actions could be lost as a result of hypoxia promoting a depletion of COMP.

Abstract: MgCl2·6H2O-Mg(NO3)2·6H2O eutectic has a proper melting point and high latent heat for solar water heating systems with latent heat storage. In this paper, the exact composition of the eutectic and the corresponding phase change temperature are determined by measuring the phase change characteristics of mixtures of MgCl2·6H2O and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O in various ratios. MgCl2·6H2O-Mg(NO3)2·6H2O eutectics, the melting temperature of which is around 58°C, can be obtained with the mass fraction of MgCl2·6H2O ranging from 35% to 50%. The eutectics are composited with porous fumed silica to improve its thermo-physical properties. The eutectic/SiO2 composite retains a similar melting point of the pure eutectic, is of no liquid leakage even after melting while the SiO2 weighs more than 15wt%, and the specific enthalpy reaches 88.13kJkg−1. The eutectic/SiO2 composite has a thermal conductivity 5% higher than pure eutectics and better thermal stability and cycle stability. The thermogravimetric analysis shows its weight loss is 8.03% less than pure eutectic at 300°C. And the eutectics suffers a decrease in phase change enthalpy after 100 thermal cycles by 9.2%, much lower compared with the 37.23% for pure eutectics due to the phase separation during the thermal cycles. Thermo-physical properties and stability of MgCl2·6H2O-Mg(NO3)2·6H2O eutectic have been enhanced by fumed silica.

Abstract: 19 kinds of different ratio of binary mixed molten salt have been formulated, and the formulation of a low melting point binary molten salt has been exploited and its primary thermophysical properties were presented here. The eutectic temperature of the selected binary salt mixture was determined to be 116.9℃. Further the decomposition point, specific heat, density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and corrosion were determined respectively. Sensible thermal storage cost of the novel eutectic mixture was found to be lower than that of conventional solar salt and HITEC salt. The performance of the binary salt mixture taken at different stages during the test of 1200-h exposure to constant high temperature was discussed based on the results obtained from long-term thermal stability studies. The results show that thermodynamic properties of the molten salt show perfect repeatability before and after the experiments, and most variations rate of the thermal physical properties is within±10%, which can be considered as an implication that the candidate has good thermal stability. Therefore, this new kind of binary molten salt thermal storage materials is more competitive and promising to be used in solar power generation systems while providing a comprehensive data for its engineering application and theoretical research.

Abstract: A spectrally selective TiAlC/TiAlCN/TiAlSiCN/TiAlSiCO/TiAlSiO coating was deposited on stainless steel substrate by unbalanced magnetron sputtering system. Each individual layer of the tandem absorber was optimized by varying the reactive gas flow rates (C2H2, N2 and O2) and target power densities (Ti, Al and Si). The optimized tandem absorber shows a solar absorptance of 0.960 and an emittance of 0.15 at 82°C, measured using solar spectrum reflectometer and emissometer, respectively. In order to study the optical properties of the deposited tandem absorber at high operating temperatures the reflectance spectra of the tandem absorber were measured at temperatures ranging from 80°C to 500°C by UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer and FTIR spectrometers. The reflectance spectra of the as-deposited sample and after high temperature reflectance measurements did not show any significant changes. The thermal emittance of the tandem absorber at high temperatures (80–500°C) was studied in detail. At the temperature of 200°C, 300°C, 400°C and 500°C the tandem absorber shows the emittance of 0.152–0.157, 0.181–0.19, 0.214–0.246 and 0.251–0.275, respectively with an absorptance of ~0.930. These results show the good selectivity of the tandem absorber even at high operating temperatures (e.g., 500°C) with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 88%, thus demonstrating that the tandem absorber is suitable for solar thermal power generation applications. Reflectance and roughness data of the absorber coating post annealing in air up to 600°C for 2h, carried out independently, corroborated the present results.

Abstract: A promising strategy is proposed for facilely and successively replicating randomly arranged pyramids on an etched silicon wafer to polystyrene (PS) surface. First, a nickel mold insert with negative pyramids is fabricated via combining electroless plating and subsequent electroplating with an etched silicon wafer as a template. Then, by using microinjection compression molding with the nickel mold insert as a template, the pyramids on the insert are accurately transcribed to the PS surface. The pyramids on the PS replica surface have the hemlines of about 1–7µm and heights of about 1–4µm. The PS replica surface exhibits a reflectance of about 5% in the wavelength range of 400–900nm and an enhanced transmittance. That is, it exhibits an enhanced light trapping effect, which originates from a combination of staggered arrangement and dense distribution of the pyramids with arc-shaped top and different sizes. Especially, a thin film solar cell covered with the PS replica exhibits increased power conversion efficiency enhancement of up to 7.9% under normal incidence comparing to that covered with the PS counterpart. The solar cell covered with the PS replica also shows an excellent photovoltaic performance over a wide range of incident angles (0–70°). The proposed fast and efficient replication strategy can be an excellent candidate for developing antireflective protective layers without complicated procedures and expensive materials.

Abstract: Cu2Sn(SxSe1−x)3 (CTSSe) (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.03) thin films are prepared using sputtered metal precursors. The influence of the quantity of selenium doped during an annealing process on the properties of CTSSe thin films and solar cells is investigated. The synthesized CTSSe thin films are grown in the monoclinic crystal structure with a densely packed morphology. The growth of the CTSSe thin films is successfully demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The band gap energy of the CTSSe thin films are extrapolated from the optical spectra of the band edge region to be 0.86eV and 0.88eV. A compositional analysis using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy shows a consistent increase in the selenium content with increase in the quantity of added selenium. This dependence is confirmed by changes in the crystallinity, composition, optical and electrical properties. CTSSe thin-film solar cells (TFSCs) were fabricated with a structure of Mo/CTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO/Al. The best efficiency of 2.49% was achieved for the fabricated CTSSe TFSC with a Voc of 190.8mV, Jsc of 34.6mA/cm2, and FF of 37%.

Abstract: The β subunits of Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel (VGCC) are cytosolic proteins that interact with the VGCC pore -forming subunit and participate in the trafficking of the channel to the cell membrane and in ion influx regulation. β subunits also exert functions independently of their binding to VGCC by translocation to the cell nucleus including the control of gene expression. Mutations of the neuronal Cacnb4 (β4) subunit are linked to human neuropsychiatric disorders including epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. It is believed that the pathogenic phenotype induced by these mutations is associated with channel-independent functions of the β4 subunit. In this report, we investigated the role of β4 subunit in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and examined whether these functions could be altered by a pathogenic mutation. To this end, stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells expressing either rat full-length β4 or the rat C-terminally truncated epileptic mutant variant β1-481 were generated. The subcellular localization of both proteins differed significantly. Full-length β4 localizes almost exclusively in the cell nucleus and concentrates into the nucleolar compartment, while the C-terminal-truncated β1-481 subunit was less concentrated within the nucleus and absent from the nucleoli. Cell proliferation was found to be reduced by the expression of β4, while it was unaffected by the epileptic mutant. Also, full-length β4 interfered with cell cycle progression by presumably preventing cells from entering the S-phase via a mechanism that partially involves endogenous B56δ, a regulatory subunit of the phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that binds β4 but not β1-481. Analysis of β4 subcellular distribution during the cell cycle revealed that the protein is highly expressed in the nucleus at the G1/S transition phase and that it is translocated out of the nucleus during chromatin condensation and cell division. These results suggest that nuclear accumulation of β4 at the G1/S transition phase affects the progression into S-phase resulting in a decrease in the rate of cell proliferation. Regulation of the cell cycle exit is a critical step in determining the number of neuronal precursors and neuronal differentiation suggesting that mutations of the β4 subunit could affect neural development and formation of the mature central nervous system.

Abstract: Transition metal oxides (TMOs) have recently been proved to efficiently serve as hole-selective contacts in crystalline silicon (c-Si) heterojunction solar cells. In the present work, two TMO/c-Si heterojunctions are explored using MoO3 (reference) and V2O5 as an alternative candidate. It has been found that V2O5 devices present larger (16% improvement) power conversion efficiency mainly due to their higher open-circuit voltage. While V2O5/c-Si devices with textured front surfaces exhibit larger short-circuit currents, it is also observed that flat solar cell architectures allow for passivation of the V2O5/n-Si interface, giving significant carrier lifetimes of 200 μs (equivalent to a surface recombination velocity of Seff ~140cms−1) as derived from impedance analysis. As a consequence, a significant open-circuit voltage of 662mV is achieved. It is found that, at the TMO/c-Si contact, a TMO work function enhancement ΔΦTMO occurs during the heterojunction formation with the consequent dipole layer enlargement Δ’=Δ+ΔΦTMO. Our results provide new insights into the TMO/c-Si contact energetics, carrier transport across the interface and surface recombination allowing for further understanding of the nature of TMO/c-Si heterojunctions.

Abstract: Density functional theory in combination with the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism is used to study the electronic transport properties of MAPbI3, MASnI3 and mixed-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskites (MA–methylammonium). The largest electronic transport is obtained for tin-halide sample due to the delocalization of electronic states in the system. The mixed sample also shows improved transport properties as compared to the lead-halide system. In addition, tin-based perovskites are less sensitive to the spin-orbit interactions, whereas the electronic transport properties of MAPbI3 are strongly affected by the relativistic effects. These findings indicate the possibility of enhancing charge carrier transport in organometallic perovskites by metal atom mixing.

Abstract: A promising route toward affordable and efficient solar energy conversion lies in the development of the high temperature Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) tower. The extreme thermal stress conditions to which the tower receivers may be submitted raise the question of the ability of these components to efficiently perform over extended periods of time. Conventional methods commonly used to assess the mechanical stability and lifetime of these components involve laboratory testing, which suffers from the fundamental inability of these methods to effectively reproduce the real operating conditions. In this work, we suggest an original set-up based upon the use of acoustic emission for in-situ thermo-mechanical investigation of receiver materials exposed to concentrated solar irradiation, named IMPACT (In-situ thermo-Mechanical Probe by ACoustic Tracking). The ability of this set-up to precisely track the nature, the location and the dynamics of mechanical defects in the receiver material is assessed. Implications for future characterization tools aimed at obtaining an in-depth understanding of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of a wide range of materials in real-working operation is also discussed.

Abstract: Silicon heterojunction solar cells use crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers as optical absorbers and employ bilayers of doped/intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) to form passivating contacts. Recently, we demonstrated that such solar cells increase their operating voltages and thus their conversion efficiencies during light exposure. We found that this performance increase is due to improved passivation of the a-Si:H/c-Si interface and is induced by injected charge carriers (either by light soaking or forward-voltage biasing of the device). Here, we discuss this counterintuitive behavior and establish that: (i) the performance increase is observed in solar cells as well as modules; (ii) this phenomenon requires the presence of doped a-Si:H films, but is independent from whether light is incident from the a-Si:H(p) or the a-Si:H(n) side; (iii) UV and blue photons do not play a role in this effect; (iv) the performance increase can be observed under illumination intensities as low as 20Wm−1 (0.02-sun) and appears to be almost identical in strength when under 1-sun (1000Wm−1); (v) the underlying physical mechanism likely differs from annealing-induced surface passivation.

Abstract: Planar perovskite solar cells using organic charge selective contacts were fabricated. In a vacuum deposited perovskite-based solar cell, dopant and additive free triazatruxene as the hole transport layer was introduced for device fabrication. High open-circuit voltage of 1090mV was obtained using methylammonium lead iodide (Eg=1.55eV) as light harvesting material, thus representing a loss of only 460mV which is in close vicinity of mature silicon technology (400mV). The devices showed a very competitive photovoltaic performance, monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 80% and the power conversion efficiencies in excess of 15% were measured with a negligible degree of hysteresis.

Abstract: Background
Most metastatic spinal cord lesions are located either in the intradural, extramedullary, or in the epidural compartments. Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis (ISCM) is a rare central nervous system spread of cancer. The aim of this report was to evaluate ISCM in the published literature.
Methods
A literature review of PubMed from 1960 to 2016 was undertaken for the publications having demographic, clinical, histological, and outcome data.
Results
A total of 59 relevant papers were identified, showing 128 cases of intramedullary metastasis from lung cancer. The incidence of lung cancer as the primary malignancy with intramedullary metastasis was 56%. The median time from diagnosis of primary to intramedullary metastasis was 6months. Survival improved with multimodality therapy compared to monotherapy (4monthsvs. 6.3months) (hazard ratio=0.501; 95% confidence interval, 0.293–0.857).
Conclusion
Lung cancer is the predominant cause of intramedullary involvement of the spinal cord. Overall prognosis is poor, although a multimodality approach was associated with improved survival.

Abstract: We introduce copper oxide (CuO) nanostructured selective solar absorbers having a broadband solar absorption over visible to near infrared wavelengths while suppressing long wavelength emission. The detailed mechanism enabling the enhanced solar absorption was investigated using the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Both indoor and outdoor solar absorption experiments were conducted to investigate the performance of the suggested absorber in a well-controlled and actual operating conditions, respectively. The combined effects of the suggested absorber and double-glazing layout were also investigated. The results show that the sharp morphology of the CuO structures and its random size distribution enable the enhanced broadband optical absorption, and the resulting performance was measured to be approximately 95% and 97% of that of the current state-of-the-art TiNOX absorber for single and double glazing case, respectively. The suggested absorbers can provide a near-equivalent performance with the current-state-of-the-art solar absorber with much simpler and faster fabrication process. Furthermore, the numerical and experimental frameworks provided in this study will help develop high efficiency solar collectors.

Abstract: Current transport through a unique structure design employing high quality GaN based heterostructure with sharp interfaces has been investigated. A novel approach of structure design has been adopted to enhance the current transport in GaN heterostructures with a specific number of barrier layers of AlN which includes Single Barrier Heterostructure (SBH) and Double Barrier Heterostructure (DBH) devices. The high band gap AlN can act as a barrier for current conduction between GaN layers and help in effectively enhancing the current transport in the device through tunneling phenomena. A highly enhanced current transport in comparison with No Barrier Heterostructure (NBH) has been observed in SBH and a further improvement is perceived in DBH. Moreover, the phenomenon of current conduction is explained through drift-diffusion model, in which current enhancement upon subsequent addition of high bandgap barrier layer has resulted in localized high electric field and thus charge carrier velocity overshoots. Further, this has also been explained via quantum model, by interference of transmitted and reflected electron wave at interfaces. UV photodetectors using such heterostructure designs with and without AlN barrier layers in metal-semiconductor-metal geometry have been fabricated. The UV photodetection device developed using DBH yields photoresponsivity 80 times higher as compared to NBH device under UV illumination (325nm). Employment of such structures will enable scaling up the production of highly efficient optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain-containing proteins constitute a family of proteins and are substrate adaptors of AAA ATPase Cdc48. UBX proteins can bind to the N-terminal region of Cdc48 to perform endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD). In this study, we identified two UBX domain-containing proteins, Ubx1 and Ubx2, in Pichia pastoris and found that the two proteins could recover the growth defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in ubx2Δ. Our results revealed that Ubx1 and Ubx2 play critical roles in synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids by affecting Spt23. In addition, the results demonstrated that both Ubx1 and Ubx2 are involved in lipid droplet formation and protein degradation. Deletion of UBX1 led to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and disruption of UBX2 impaired cell viability under osmotic stress. The phenotypes of ubx1Δ+UBX2, ubx2Δ+UBX1 and ubx1Δubx2Δ and RNA-seq data suggested that Ubx1 and Ubx2 play different roles in cell functions, and the roles of Ubx1 may be more numerous than Ubx2. In summary, our findings provide new insights into the relationship between lipid homeostasis and cell functions in the oil-producing organism P. pastoris.

Abstract: In the present study Concentrated Solar Energy (CSE) was used in order to weld thin plates (3mm thickness) of the 6082 aluminum alloy in the T6 condition. A specially designed vacuum chamber and a cooling system were utilized in order to create the inert atmosphere and the heat dissipation required, respectively. The experiments resulted in the production of a sound butt weld between the aluminum plates which presented a 23% and 32% reduction of the microhardness and the Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) respectively compared to the base metal but are in good correlation with other fusion welding methods of the same material. Finally, based on the experimental results, a finite element 3D thermal model of the process was developed that can be used for the design and optimization of welds of aluminum alloys using the same experimental set-up.

Abstract: As a solar energy storage medium at moderate-to-high temperature, molten chlorate severally corrodes metal vessels. The corrosion behavior and mechanisms of pure nickel (Ni), GH4033 and GH4169 in 793K molten eutectic NaCl-MgCl2 were studied. During the initial stage of corrosion, pure Ni and GH4033 gain weight from the many plate-like shells formed on the sample surface. After corrosion for 40h, all sample surfaces were rather porous and loosened. MgO nuclei that were attached to the loosened microstructure surface fell off with the microstructures, which led to a continual decrease in the sample weight. The three sample surfaces were mainly composed of MgO and Ni or (Ni, Fe) from the sample substrate. Al and Ti were preferentially oxidized and stably excited on the GH4033 surface, which inhibits the corrosion process. The corrosion rate of GH4169 was the highest for the δ phase, which is rich in Nb, and phase boundaries were corroded preferentially. In the anode reaction, metal atoms escape from the corrosion system in the form of chlorides or aqueous chlorides.

Abstract: D-erythroascorbate peroxidase (EAPX1) deficiency causes glutathione deprivation, leading to the accumulation of methylglyoxal and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and especially, induction of cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp1) in Candida albicans. Nevertheless, reciprocal effects between changes in Ccp1 activity and the antioxidative D-erythroascorbic acid- and glutathione-dependent redox status, which reflects methylglyoxal biosynthesis altering pathophysiology are unclear in eukaryotes. To elucidate the effect of CCP1 expression on EAPX1 and glutathione reductase (Glr1) activity-mediated D-erythroascorbic acid biosynthesis and redox homeostasis, the CCP1 gene was disrupted and overexpressed. First, we demonstrated both glutathione-independent and-dependent metabolite contents and their corresponding gene transcripts and enzyme activities (i.e., Ccp1, catalase-peroxidase [KatG], superoxide dismutase [Sod], Eapx1, and Glr1) in CCP1 mutants. Second, methylglyoxal-oxidizing alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh1) and methylglyoxal-reducing oxidoreductase activity on glycolytic methylglyoxal and pyruvate production and NAD(P)H content were determined in these mutants. Contrary to our expectation, CCP1 disruption (42.19±3.22nmolO2h−1mgwetcell−1) failed to affect cell respiration compared to the wild-type strain (41.62±7.11nmolO2h−1mgwetcell−1) under cyanide treatment, and in contrast to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment (21.74±1.03nmol O2h−1mgwetcell−1). Additionally, Ccp1 predominantly detoxified H2O2 rather than negligible scavenging activities towards methylglyoxal and other oxidants. CCP1 deficiency stimulated Sod and Adh1 activity but downregulated Glr1, Eapx1, catalase, and peroxidase activity while enhancing KatG, EAPX1, and GLR1 transcription by decreasing glutathione and D-erythroascorbic acid and increasing pyruvate. Noticeably, the ROS-accumulating CCP1-deficient mutant maintained steady-state levels of methylglyoxal, which was revealed to be regulated by methylglyoxal-oxidizing and −reducing activity with drastic changes in NAD(P)H. We confirmed and clarified our results by showing that CCP1/EAPX1 double disruptants underwent severe growth defects due to the D-erythroascorbic acid and glutathione depletion because of pyruvate overaccumulation. These observations were made in both budding and hyphal-growing CCP1 mutants. The revealed metabolic network involving Ccp1 and other redox regulators affected ROS and methylglyoxal through D-erythroascorbic acid and glutathione-dependent metabolites, thereby influencing dimorphism. This is the first report of the Ccp1-mediated D-erythroascorbic acid and glutathione biosynthesis accompanying methylglyoxal scavengers for full fungal virulence.

Abstract: The high performance multicrystalline (HPMC) silicon material with the feature of small and uniform grains has already been widely adopted in photovoltaic industry nowadays. However, the HPMC silicon ingots still suffer a comparatively lower minority carrier lifetime at the ingot edges induced by Fe in-diffusion. Here, we have engineered the grain boundaries (GBs) to control the low carrier lifetime zone at the HPMC silicon ingot edges, based on the grain nucleation enhanced by silicon powder coating at the crucible walls. The resultant GBs with high density paralleling to the crucible walls can getter Fe impurity, and meanwhile become the barriers for Fe diffusion. Therefore, the detrimental effect of interstitial Fe impurity on the carrier lifetime of edge wafers is sufficiently reduced and the performance of corresponding solar cells is improved. The solar cells have a narrower distribution in the performance, which is beneficial for the stability and durability of solar cells and modules. This growth concept using GBs to control the behaviors of Fe diffused from the crucible walls is interesting for photovoltaic application.

Abstract: While progress has been made in understanding the behaviour of the recently identified carrier-induced degradation mechanism in p-type multicrystalline silicon solar cells, little is currently known about the root cause of the defect or its possible existence in other materials. In this work, we present evidence suggesting that the defect also exists in Czochralski grown monocrystalline silicon wafers. For both mono- and multicrystalline silicon we demonstrate: 1) the presence of a degradation and recovery of bulk minority carrier lifetime induced by either illuminated or dark annealing; 2) a modulation in the magnitude of degradation by varying the firing conditions; and 3) capture cross-section ratios of 39.4 ± 4.9 and 33.4 ± 1.5 in monocrystalline and multicrystalline silicon, respectively. The results indicate that the recently identified degradation mechanism does not only occur in multicrystalline silicon from illuminated annealing at elevated temperatures, but it is also induced by dark annealing at elevated temperatures, and that the degradation can occur in Czochralski grown silicon.

Abstract: Trisomy 21 is the most common chromosomal disorder and underlies Down syndrome. Epigenetics, such as DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications, plays a vital role in Down syndrome. However, the functions of epigenetics-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), found to have an impact on neural diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, remain unknown in Down syndrome. In this study, we analyzed the RNA sequencing data from Down syndrome-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and normal iPSCs. A large number of lncRNAs were identified differentially expressed in Down syndrome-iPSCs. Notably, stronger perturbation was shown in the expression of lncRNAs compared to protein coding genes (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, P<0.05), suggesting that lncRNAs play more important roles in Down syndrome. Through gene set enrichment analysis and bi-clustering, we also found that most of the differential expressed lncRNAs were closely associated with mitochondrial functions (e.g. mitochondrion organization, P=3.21×10−17; mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport, P=1.73×10−19 and mitochondrial membrane organization, P=4.04×10−8). PCR-array and qRT-PCR results revealed that almost all genes related to mitochondria were down-regulated in Down syndrome-iPSCs, implying that mitochondria were dysfunctional in Down syndrome (e.g. ATP5B, Fold Change=−8.2317; COX6A1, Fold Change=−12.7788 and SLC25A17, Fold Change=−22.1296). All in all, our study indicated that a stronger perturbation of lncRNAs expression may lead to the dysfunction of mitochondria in Down syndrome.

Abstract: In this paper, solution-processed Au-coated Ag nanowires (Ag@Au NWs) was successfully fabricated as top electrode by spray deposition in planar perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with structure ITO/PTAA:F4-TCNQ/MAPbI3/PC61BM/Ag@Au NWs, which shows favorable bandgap alignment. Sheet resistance of electrode and series resistance of solar cells over time as well as the stability of PVSCs were measured. The results indicate that the Au shell which serves as a physical separation layer sandwiched in between the perovskite/hole transporting layer (HTL) and the halide-reactive silver nanowires (Ag NWs) can significantly enhance the stability of PVSCs. The efficiency of solar cells employing Ag NWs as top electrode decreases rapidly within 10min while the efficiency of solar cells employing Ag@Au NWs still remains 85% of its original efficiency even after one week in air. The as-fabricated PVSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 11.0% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.99V, a short-circuit current density of 18.5mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 64.3%. This work paves a way for realizing low cost, stable, all solution processable PVSCs.

Abstract: The role of properties of ultra-thin TiO2 compact layers (c-TiO2) deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, as a function of their thickness, has been studied by using electrochemical and optical techniques as well as surface morphology. The performance of films of thicknesses varying from 7nm to 20nm was compared with TiO2 films having a constant thickness (7nm) prepared with different precursor concentrations. The surface morphology of the compact layer was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and it was observed that a film thickness less than 10nm was sufficient to serve as a compact layer in the fabrication of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The power conversion efficiency (ɳ) of devices was found to be similar for a compact layer of thickness of 10nm and observed to degrade for thicknesses >10nm. This was attributed to the combined effect of optical transmittance, morphology, conductivity and position of Fermi level. Further, for devices prepared with compact layer of constant thickness (7nm), a significant improvement in the ɳ (5.2%) is obtained for DSSCs prepared using 10mM precursor concentration. The improvement in the ɳ is attributed to the facile transport as well as proper position of Fermi level without compromising optical and morphological properties. The analyses suggest that properties of the thin TiO2 compact layer play a significant role in the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs.

Abstract: Anti-solvents play a critical role on the preparation of perovskite active layers for photovoltaic applications. This work explores the treatment of various anti-solvents for adjusting the crystallinity and morphology of perovskite active layer. It is found that the anti-solvent with a low dielectric constant and dipole moment is the most suitable one for the preparation of perovskite layer. It is also noted that the optimal volume ratio of the perovskite precursor to toluene as an anti-solvent is 1:3. Using toluene as the anti-solvent, the perovskite solar cells (p-i-n type) are fabricated with a single cell and a sub-module within an active area of 0.10cm2 and 11.25cm2, respectively. Such display exhibits impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 13.12% and 11.60% with negligible J-V hysteresis, respectively, under the illumination of 100mW/cm2 (AM1.5G).

Abstract: A room temperature stratagy was proposed and realized for the fabrication of TiO2 scaffold for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). By sueccetively sputtering TiO2, thermal evaporating PTFE template and sputtering TiO2 again, bilayer TiO2 electron extraction layer was prepared with controllable porosity. Owning to the high sputtering power, the electron transport layer consisting of compact layer and TiO2 nanopillars was fully crystallized and no post thermal treatment was needed for the removal of PTFE template. The hysteresis of PSC was modulated and the porosity dependence of hysteresis was analyzed. PSC with a PCE of 15.08% and neglectable hysteresis was fabricated when the porosity of mesoporous scaffold was 45.77%. Our methodology offered a low cost room temperature scheme for the fabrication of mesostructured PSC. This approach makes large scale flexible PCS devices possible. What is more, this technique is versatile for the preparation of functional mesoporous materials with different pore structure and porosity requirements.

Abstract: Excessive endothelial activation by inflammatory mediators is a critical contributing factor of sepsis pathophysiology. ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), an enzyme that binds and edits double-stranded RNAs, exhibits immune regulatory properties. Whether ADAR1 is involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis is unclear. In the present study, we used human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) as an in vitro model system to investigate the roles of ADAR1 in interleukin (IL)-1β-induced endothelial activation. We found that stimulation with IL-1β caused opposite changes in the expression of ADAR1 and the adherence molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. ADAR1 overexpression reduced while ADAR1 knockdown enhanced IL-1β-induced HUVEC activation as assessed by ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression and THP-1 monocyte recruitment. Furthermore, ADAR1 was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-143 in HUVECs by a luciferase reporter assay, and miR-143 overexpression promoted while miR-143 knockdown inhibited HUVEC activation by IL-1β. In addition, ADAR1 overexpression prevented the enhancement effects of miR-143 overexpression on IL-1β-induced HUVEC activation. Our mechanistic studies revealed that ADAR1 overexpression reduced while ADAR1 knockdown enhanced PKR, IκBα, and NFκB phosphorylation induced by IL-1β. In addition, blocking NFκB signaling with the specific NFκB inhibitor PDTC (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) prevented IL-1β-induced HUVEC activation enhanced by ADAR1 knockdown. Collectively, these data indicated that ADAR1 is targeted by miR-143 to regulate IL-1β-induced HUVEC activation, and the NFκB pathway acts as the downstream mediator of ADAR1. In conclusion, miR-143 and ADAR1 may serve as therapeutic targets for sepsis.

Abstract: In recent years, the utilization of organic phase change materials (PCM) is increasingly attractive especially for the storage of thermal energy in building fabric materials absorbing solar energy. From this perspective, the thermal properties of the new copper-titania hybrid nanocomposite embedded organic methyl ester phase change material (HNPCM) were explored experimentally, for different proportions of the hybrid nanocomposite (HyNC). The test results suggest that, the incorporation of the HyNC (from 0.05% to 0.5% by wt.) into the pure PCM has attributed for achieving chemical stability, congruent phase transition temperature (35.32°C), good latent heat potential (109.14kJ/kg) with reduction in the supercooling degree. The crystalline fins-like structured HyNC particles have effectively improved the thermal conductivity of the HNPCMs from 2.9% to 65.2% without sacrificing thermal stability up to 218°C, for the aforementioned HyNC proportions. Furthermore, the HNPCMs exhibited appreciable heat storage and release characteristics in terms of reduced time consumption during freezing and melting by 77.87% and 70.89%, respectively. The improved thermal properties exhibited by the HNPCMs enabled them be considered as a viable candidate to be incorporated into the exterior fabric elements of the building absorbing the solar energy thereby; the temperature swings in indoor spaces can be regulated suitably.

Abstract: Objectives/background
CXCR4 is a receptor for stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), a molecule that has a chemotactic activity for lymphocytes and is important in homing of hematopoietic stem cells to their adult marrow. We evaluated the CXCR4 (CD184) expression in the harvest cells and in the post-transplant bone marrow (BM) and its relation to engraftment, as determined by the consensus criteria and chimerism.
Methods
This is a prospective study which included 30 patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; 15 patients received autograft and 15 patients received allograft on dates between January 2012 and May 2014. We assessed CD184 (CXCR4) using flow cytometry in the harvest cells together with post-transplant BM assessment on Day 28 and Day 90 for complete morphologic, molecular studies, and detection of CD184 expression on CD34+ cells with chimerism studies on total peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Results
Diagnoses of the enrolled patients were as follows: seven (24.1%) with acute myeloid leukemia, eight (27.6%) with multiple myeloma, four (13.8%) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, three (10.3%) with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, two (6.9%) with myelodysplastic syndromes, two (6.9%) with aplastic anemia, two (6.9%) with chronic myeloid leukemia, one (3.4%) with Hodgkin lymphoma, and one (3.4%) with plasmacytomas. One patient died and was excluded from the study because there were not enough data about engraftment. There was no statistical significance between the level of CD184 in stem cell harvest and the prediction of successful engraftment (p>0.05) as well as in Day 28 BM sample (p>0.05), whereas there was a statistical significance between the level of CD184 in Day 90 BM sample and the occurrence of successful engraftment (p=0.002).
Conclusion
SDF-1/CXCR4 axis plays a crucial role in engraftment; however, more studies are warranted to assess their expression post-transplant. Evaluating the ligand (chemokine, SDF-1) or its receptor (CXCR4) may serve as potential surrogate markers for assessment of engraftment.

Abstract: This work carries out a study on the reaction pathways during the selenization of Cu-Zn-Sn-S sulfide precursors deposited on Mo/glass. The effect of the annealing temperature on the structural and compositional properties of the materials was studied between 250 and 600°C combining glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES), x-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy measurements. Through a deep chemical-physical characterization of the front, bulk and back regions of the CZTSSe layers, we show that both diffusion phenomena and the chemical affinity between some elements govern the reaction pathway. The experimental observations support a formation mechanism of CZTSSe that proceeds through two different paths. At the surface, the progressive incorporation of Se triggers the diffusion of Sn to the surface, which results to a fast formation of tin selenides compared to copper selenides. In addition, the predominance of Se-rich CZTSSe is observed at the top part region.

Abstract: TiO2 compact layers are wildly used for electron selective contact in perovskite solar cells. The function of TiO2 selective contact can be modified by doping metal ions in the TiO2 compact layers. As lanthanide elements usually exhibit unique properties for their incompletely occupied 5d or 4f orbitals, we prepared lanthanum doped TiO2 compact layers by spray pyrolysis method as the electron selective contact of perovskite solar cells. SEM images indicate lanthanum dopants improve the smoothness of TiO2 layers. In the optimized concentration, the average PCE of devices is promoted from 12.4% to 14.4% with the highest PCE of 17.2%, which comes from the improvement on charge transfer and recombination. Moreover, the Lanthanum dopants also lead to the improvement in photo-stability of perovskite solar cells. For the device with optimized La concentration, 80% of its original PCE is preserved after 200h aging under continuous one sun illumination.

Abstract: Cisplatin (DDP) is the first line chemotherapeutic drug for several cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). Unfortunately, the rapid development of drug resistance remains a significant challenge for the clinical application of cisplatin. There is an urgent need to develop new strategies to overcome DDP resistance for cancer treatment. In this study, four types of human GC cells have been divided into naturally sensitive or naturally resistant categories according to their responses to cisplatin. PARP1 activity (poly (ADP-ribose), PAR) was found to be greatly increased in cisplatin-resistant GC cells. PARP1 inhibitors significantly enhanced cisplatin-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in the resistant GC cells via the inhibition of PAR. Mechanistically, PARP1 inhibitors suppress DNA-PKcs stability and reduce the capability of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair via the NHEJ pathway. This was also verified in BGC823/DDP GC cells with acquired cisplatin resistance. In conclusion, we identified that PARP1 is a useful interceptive target in cisplatin-resistant GC cells. Our data provide a promising therapeutic strategy against cisplatin resistance in GC cells that has potential translational significance.

Abstract: The addition of Ag to Cu-Ga-In precursors for reaction to form (AgCu)(InGa)Se2 has shown benefits including improved adhesion, greater process tolerance and potential for improved device performance. In this study, metal precursors were sputtered with a Cu-Ga/In/Ag-Ga sequence with Ag/(Cu+Ag) = 0.25 and (Ag+Cu)/(Ga+In) = 0.90. These precursor layers are shown to be unstable, with a phase evolution during storage at room temperature revealed by x-ray diffraction (XRD). This behavior was studied in samples annealed in the temperature range of 60–150°C or stored for up to 90 days. XRD analyses indicated the formation of (Ag1−xCux)In2 with Cu content of 28% and 36% for samples annealed at 100°C and 150°C, respectively. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and XRD analyses on selenized samples showed a uniform distribution of Ag and Cu through the films and a Ga accumulation near the back interface. Solar cells fabricated from the selenized films showed improved device performance in VOC and FF as a result of the precursor anneal.

Abstract: Background
Diabetes mellitus has become the third human killer following cancer and cardiovascular disease. Millions of patients, often children, suffer from type 1 diabetes (T1D). Stem cells created hopes to regenerate damaged body tissues and restore their function.
Aim
This work aimed at clarifying and comparing the therapeutic potential of differentiated and non-differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a new line of therapy for T1D.
Methods
40 Female albino rats divided into group I (control): 10 rats and group II (diabetic), III and IV, 10 rats in each, were injected with streptozotocin (50mg/kg body weight). Group III (MSCs) were transplanted with bone marrow derived MSCs from male rats and group IV (IPCs) with differentiated insulin producing cells. Blood and pancreatic tissue samples were taken from all rats for biochemical and histological studies.
Results
MSCs reduced hyperglycemia in diabetic rats on day 15 while IPCs normalizes blood glucose level on day 7. Histological and morphometric analysis of pancreas of experimental diabetic rats showed improvement in MSCs-treated group but in IPCs-treated group, β-cells insulin immunoreactions were obviously returned to normal, with normal distribution of β-cells in the center and other cells at the periphery. Meanwhile, most of the pathological lesions were still detected in diabetic rats.
Conclusion
MSCs transplantation can reduce blood glucose level in recipient diabetic rats. IPCs initiate endogenous pancreatic regeneration by neogenesis of islets. IPCs are better than MSCs in regeneration of β-cells. So, IPCs therapy can be considered clinically to offer a hope for patients suffering from T1D.

Abstract: Mevalonate pathway deregulation has been observed in several diseases, including Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD). MKD is a hereditary auto-inflammatory disorder, due to mutations at mevalonate kinase gene (MVK), encoding mevalonate kinase (MK) enzyme. MVK mutations have been reported as associated with impairment of mevalonate pathway with consequent decrease of protein prenylation levels, defective autophagy and increase of IL-1β secretion, followed by cell death. Since 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), a metabolite of cholesterol, can suppress IL-1β production, thus reducing inflammation, we evaluated the effect of 25-HC in an in vitro model of mevalonate pathway alteration, obtained using Lovastatin. Human glioblastoma cell line (U87-MG) was chosen to mimic, at least in part, the central nervous system impairment observed in MKD; 25-HC effects were evaluated aimed at disclosing if this compound could be considered as novel potential drug for MKD. Our results showed that 25-HC is able to reduce inflammation but it is ineffective to restore autophagy flux and to decrease apoptosis levels, both caused by lower protein prenylation; so, in spite of its anti-inflammatory action it is not useful to rescue defective prenylation/autophagy impairment-driven apoptosis in Lovastatin impaired mevalonate pathway. We hypothesize the presence in the mevalonate pathway of alternative mechanisms acting between inflammation and apoptotic autophagy impairment.

Abstract: LncRNAs play a vital role in alternative splicing of target genes. However, the mechanisms underlying lncRNAs involvement in splicing are poorly understood. In the present study, we identified a previously uncharacterized lncRNA, which is denoted as TPM1-AS, is reverse-transcribed from the fourth intronic region of the tropomyosin I (TPM1). In situ hybridization and RNA immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that TPM1-AS was located in the nucleus and interacted with RNA-binding motif protein 4 (RBM4) in human esophageal cancer cells. TPM1-AS overexpression or RBM4 knockdown decreased endogenous exon 2a expression of TPM1, resulting in specifically down-regulation of TPM1variant V2 and V7 in human esophageal cancer cells. Mechanismly, the interaction of TPM1-AS with RBM4 hindered binding of RBM4 to TPM1 pre-mRNA and inhibited RBM4 to promote endogenous exon 2a inclusion of TPM1. Importantly, overexpression of TPM1-AS inhibited migration and filopodium formation, whereas TPM1variant V2 and V7 promoted these behaviors of human esophageal cancer cells. Taken together, the results suggest that a natural antisense TPM1-AS regulates the alternative splicing of TPM1 through an interaction with RBM4 and involves in TPM1-mediated filopodium formation and migration of cancer cells.

Abstract: Traditional organic phase change materials (PCMs) possess the merits of high latent heat and chemical stability, but suffer from low thermal conductivity and volume expansion during phase transition. In this study, an enhanced energy storage technique with microencapsulated phase change material (MEPCM) saturated in metal foam is proposed to address these issues. The flow and thermal characteristics of MEPCM/foam under different foam geometries are experimentally extracted by means of comparing with two control groups, i.e., pristine PCM and PCM/foam modules. Particularly, the local thermal non-equilibrium effect between metal strut and MEPCM is analyzed. Results indicate that temperature reduction of 45°C for heated surface is achieved by MEPCM/foam composite due to the thermal conductivity enhancement by metal foam. However, this better thermal control performance is obtained at the cost of shrinking the thermal management time. The natural convection of core PCM is suppressed in the MEPCM shell during/after the melting process. The thermal non-equilibrium is more pronounced inside MEPCM/foam than in PCM/foam module due to the contact thermal resistance between strut and MEPCM particle. Lower porosity composite has lower surface temperature attributed to the more dominant role of combined heat conduction.

Abstract: In this work we present a comprehensive study of the role of hydrogen in the structure, morphology, composition and electro-optical properties of zinc oxide thin films deposited by rf reactive magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The transparency and conductivity of the in situ hydrogenated zinc oxide films (ZnO:H) are improved with the addition of H2 to the sputtering atmosphere, where the resistivity dropped one order of magnitude (from 3×10−2 to 2.8×10−3Ωcm) for an optimal dilution of 1.5% in argon. The effect of hydrogen in the conductivity of undoped ZnO thin films has been attributed to the shallow donor behaviour. However, we observed that the increase in the conductivity came essentially from the improvement of the mobility that reached 47.1cm2/Vs for a carrier concentration of 4.4×1019cm−3. This improvement in the mobility happens with an effective hydrogen incorporation into the bulk of the sputtered ZnO:H films, being attributed to the passivation of grain boundaries trap states while carrier concentration is dominated by the formation of Zn interstitials.

Abstract: Preparation of electron transport layer (ETL) with high uniformity by convenient and low-temperature process is of essential importance for the future development of colloidal quantum dot solar cells (CQDSCs) into large-area and flexible devices. Herein we utilized magnetron sputtering technique to deposit ZnO thin film as the ETL of PbS CQDSCs. The ZnO film deposited at ambient temperature displayed preferential growth along (001) direction, pinhole free morphology, and good optical transmittance. On rigid SnO2:F (FTO) conductive glass substrates, PbS CQDSCs with sputtered ZnO ETL achieved a power conversion efficiency of 6.47% under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation, which was higher than the 6.02% efficiency of the CQDSC fabricated on the benchmarked ZnO nanocrystals ETL. The good uniformity of sputtered ZnO film also facilitated the consistency of photovoltaic parameters of big-sized CQDSCs, as demonstrated by the similar output of four series-connected CQDSC units fabricated in one batch with a total active area of 14.4cm2. Flexible PbS CQDSCs was also fabricated on the sputtered ZnO ETL, using In2O3:Sn-coated polyethylene terephthalate (ITO-PET) as the substrate, which achieved a power conversion efficiency of 3.87% and displayed negligible decline of the photovoltaic parameters after 100-time bending treatment. Our research demonstrates that the magnetron-sputtered ZnO film, with favorable features of low-temperature process, large-area continuity, and high bending tolerance, presents promising potential for the future development of PbS CQDSCs.

Abstract: Novel optically-rough and physically-flat transparent conductive oxides (TCO) substrates were developed by spin-coating Al doped Zn1−xMgxO (AZMO) transparent conductive thin film on roughened glass substrates treated by a reactive-ion etching (RIE) process, for enhancing the light-absorption in superstrate-type solar cells without deteriorating growth of photoactive layers. These substrates possess features of high transmittance, low surface roughness and strong light-scattering behavior. A surface morphology of randomly distributed irregular cones was formed on the Corning 7059 glass substrate through the overlapping of several lens-shaped cavities etched by the carbon tetrafluoride-oxygen plasma during the RIE process. This rough interface morphology not only has light-scattering ability, but also shows an antireflection effect at the interface between the AZMO and RIE etched glass substrate. One prototype with 40 cycles AZMO coating on a RIE etched substrate showed a root-mean-square surface roughness of 4.6nm, a sheet resistance of 75.1Ω/sq, and a haze ratio in transmission of 12.2% at the wavelength of 700nm. These TCO substrates were applied to the front electrode of superstrate-type hydrogenated amorphous Si single junction solar cells. The solar cells exhibited a current gain of 11% and an efficiency gain of 14% as well as similar open-circuit voltage and fill factor with respect to the ones deposited on the AZMO coated flat glass substrate. These substrates would enable an efficient light management and the growth of high quality photoactive materials simultaneously for superstrate-type thin-film solar cells.

Abstract: Iron is essential for growth and in low iron environments such as serum many bacteria and fungi secrete ferric iron-chelating molecules called siderophores. All fungi produce hydroxamate siderophores with the exception of Mucorales fungi, which secrete rhizoferrin, a polycarboxylate siderophore. Here we investigated the biosynthesis of rhizoferrin by the opportunistic human pathogen, Rhizopus delemar. We searched the genome of R. delemar 99–880 for a homologue of the bacterial NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) protein, SfnaD, that is involved in biosynthesis of staphyloferrin A in Staphylococcus aureus. A protein was identified in R. delemar with 22% identity and 37% similarity with SfnaD, containing an N-terminal IucA/IucC family domain, and a C-terminal conserved ferric iron reductase FhuF-like transporter domain. Expression of the putative fungal rhizoferrin synthetase (rfs) gene was repressed by iron. The rfs gene was cloned and expressed in E.coli and siderophore biosynthesis from citrate and diaminobutane was confirmed using high resolution LC–MS. Substrate specificity was investigated showing that Rfs produced AMP when oxaloacetic acid, tricarballylic acid, ornithine, hydroxylamine, diaminopentane and diaminopropane were employed as substrates. Based on the production of AMP and the presence of a mono-substituted rhizoferrin, we suggest that Rfs is a member of the superfamily of adenylating enzymes. We used site-directed mutagenesis to mutate selected conserved residues predicted to be in the Rfs active site. These studies revealed that H484 is essential for Rfs activity and L544 may play a role in amine recognition by the enzyme. This study on Rfs is the first characterization of a fungal NIS enzyme. Future work will determine if rhizoferrin biosynthesis is required for virulence in Mucorales fungi.

Abstract: We prepared the anatase nanotubes (NT) and other nanostructured titania as electron accepting/transmitting layers in solar cells, using titanium anodization. Upon gaining control over the anodization, the parameters were held constant in order to observe the role of the deposited layers (by electron beam evaporation and magnetron sputtering) on the NT yield. The structural and microstructural parameters were investigated using FIB-FEG-SEM, XRD, Raman and GIXRD. Differences in the titanium layers play a significant role on the type of titania nanostructures achieved. Only dense homogeneous titanium layer surface, uniform in thickness and without cracks at macroscale, with uniformly seized isotropic nanoparticles, will enable uniform electrochemical etching and thus favourable, reproducible formation of the titania NT, and upon thermal treatment the anatase NT. Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers, which are not in direct contact to the NT, can also exhibit influence on the morphology of the titania NT charge transfer layer. In order to reach large uniform areas of nanotubes, which is required for solar cell application, the preparation of titanium layer has to be tailored.

Abstract: Carrier lifetime degradation of reactive ion etch-processed silicon samples are investigated. Two types of carrier recombination: reversible and irreversible degradations induced by reactive ion etching (RIE) are identified. Irreversible carrier recombination is due to surface damage created by the RIE process that propagates a few microns deep into the silicon substrate. Reversible carrier recombination, on the other hand, is found to be caused by radiation damage when RIE etches only into the silicon oxide, and nitrogen annealing can restore the degraded carrier lifetime. A recombination-free RIE process is then developed in combination with a passivation stack consisting of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride layers. This improved RIE process is applied to the development of high efficiency silicon solar cells resulting in a conversion efficiency exceeding 24%.

Abstract: A series of strained GaAsBi/GaAs multiple quantum well diodes are characterised to assess the potential of GaAsBi for photovoltaic applications. The devices are compared with strained and strain-balanced InGaAs based devices. The dark currents of the GaAsBi based devices are around 20 times higher than those of the InGaAs based devices. The GaAsBi devices that have undergone significant strain relaxation have dark currents that are a further 10–20 times higher. Quantum efficiency measurements show the GaAsBi devices have a lower energy absorption edge and stronger absorption than the strained InGaAs devices. These measurements also indicate incomplete carrier extraction from the GaAsBi based devices at short circuit, despite the devices having a relatively low background doping. This is attributed to hole trapping within the quantum wells, due to the large valence band offset of GaAsBi.

Abstract: Inorganic metal oxide electron-transport layers have the potential to promise perovskite solar cells with improved stability and high efficiency, but generally require high temperature to enhance conductivity and reduce defect. Here, low-temperature solution-processed inorganic SnO2-TiO2 composite layer for efficient planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells is demonstrated. The SnO2-TiO2 composite layer brings better bandgap matching at the perovskite/FTO interface that facilitates charge extraction and reduces surface recombination. Cyclic voltammetry, steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy and electrical impedance spectroscopy were conducted to reveal the energy band alignment and charge carrier dynamics. The SnO2-TiO2 composite films based solar cells acquire a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.8%, which is higher than PCEs of devices based on individual SnO2 layer and sintered TiO2 layer.

Abstract: Energy-efficient coatings based on two-layer-structured transparent heat mirrors were fabricated by depositing a vanadium oxide thin film on a silver thin film by thermal evaporation. Transparent heat mirrors are energy efficient coatings designed to save energy in hot climates by allowing only the visible part of solar radiation to pass through them and reflecting the infrared heat. These transparent heat mirrors can be used as energy-saving windows in energy-efficient buildings and green house agriculture. First, the optical, structural, and chemical properties of individual vanadium oxide thin films were investigated related to their application in transparent heat mirrors. Then, in order to realize their potential as energy efficient coating, optical characterization was performed on a two-layer structure. The performance of these coatings was calculated through integrated spectral transmittance and reflectance in the range of visible and infrared radiations. In addition, chemical depth profiling was performed to probe the diffusion of elements along the deposited layers. The fabricated coatings were found to show the expected behavior as transparent heat mirrors of high visible transparency and high infrared reflection.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical design and evaluation study for the performance of nano-composite metal-dielectric absorbers combined with selective filters for high temperature applications in high concentration solar energy harvesting, e.g. in parabolic trough collectors. Improving the spectrally selective coating of the receiver and optimizing the operating temperature above the current standard of 400°C represent a good opportunity for improving the efficiency of solar collectors and thus reducing the cost of solar electricity. The objective of our effort is to get the design rules for efficient selective coatings in higher temperatures exhibiting maximum absorption in the solar spectrum and minimum emissivity in the infrared spectrum. While these optical characteristics are the required ones for maximum energy conversion efficiency, they become increasingly difficult to satisfy for increasing temperatures because of the overlapping of the two spectral regions. Using finite-difference time-domain simulations we model different nano-composite metal-dielectric coatings, composed of materials that are stable at high temperatures, combined with spectrally selective filters and calculate the solar absorption and thermal emission coefficients. Taking also into account the optical parameters of the collector structure (sunlight concentration factor and optical losses) and the theoretically predicted Carnot efficiency, we get the total conversion efficiency of a solar collector. We evaluate the performance of the designed coatings for a wide temperature range from 400°C up to 1000°C and obtain maximum efficiencies at ~850°C operating temperature. For our best coating candidate (Cu nanoparticles in a low index dielectric matrix, e.g. SiO2) this results into a total conversion efficiency of 52%, or about a 30% performance increase compared to operation at 400°C.

Abstract: Superhydrophobic surfaces based on aluminium oxide coatings had been developed on glass substrates via solution based approach for solar panel cover glass applications. The fabricated surface was amorphous with an interconnected porous network of nanoflakes. The static contact angle of the prepared coatings was 161° and exhibited superior self–cleaning behaviour at a tilting angle less than 10°. The 300nm thick coating with refractive index value gradually decreased from air (n −1), through the fabricated coating (n −1.35) towards the glass substrate (n – 1.56) enabled it to acquire a high average transmittance of 95% with anti-reflecting property. The photovoltaic performance of commercially available solar cells covered with uncoated glass substrate and aluminium oxide coated glass substrate was measured under various conditions (such as – fabricated, artificially contaminated and self – cleaned conditions) and the results were compared. The uncoated glass substrate and aluminium oxide coated superhydrophobic glass substrate recovered the efficiency of saw dust contaminated solar panel by 67% and 91%, respectively, thereby enabling the fabricated superhydrophobic glass substrate to be effectively useful for self–cleaning cover glass applications.

Abstract: Here we report, a controlled primary nucleation aided restricted volume solvent annealing method [NR method, NR stands for nucleation assisted restricted volume solvent annealing (RVSA)] along with mixed organic cation based perovskite film for highly efficient (highest PCE: 16.78%), thermally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with full temperature compatibility for flexible substrates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency ever reported with PSCs incorporating low temperature processed ZnO as electron transport layer (ETL). Unlike the conventional RVSA method [CR method, CR refers to conventional restricted volume solvent annealing (RVSA)], the reported NR method raises the degree of supersaturation of the precursor solution due to high solvent evaporation rate during the crucial primary nucleation phase, that ensures smooth and uniform perovskite grain distribution during the rapid crystal growth phase. NR method also provides better perovskite crystallinity during the annealing induced secondary crystallization phase, as unlike CR, NR perovskite does not contain high amount of residual solvent at this stage of perovskite grain growth. The photovoltaic performance, hysteretic behaviour and device degradation phenomena of NR PSCs have been compared with CR PSCs. Enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) attained with NR method has been explained with elaborate surface morphology and topography study, along with charge transport analysis with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky analysis. Substantially mitigated photo-current hysteresis phenomenon with NR method has been elucidated in terms of inherent electrode polarization process. Adding to the merits, NR PSCs also demonstrate over three times higher device stability compared to CR PSCs, which has been investigated with frequency-dependent capacitive spectra and Mott-Schottky characterization of the aged devices.

Abstract: The absorption coefficient of AlGaInP lattice-matched to GaAs, across the composition range from AlInP to GaInP has been obtained from photocurrent versus wavelength measurements on seven homo-junction AlGaInP PIN diode structures. Due to the sensitivity of the photocurrent measurement technique, values of absorption down to 100cm−1 have been determined close to the band-gap. From these, the bandgaps in this material system were extracted across the composition range and these corroborate data in the literature that shows the band-gap becoming indirect when the aluminium content, x>0.48.

Abstract: We present and discuss advances in the development of p-type Si heterojunction solar cells with Al-doped ZnO (AZO) on both front and rear side, by means of mixed-phase Si- and SiOx-based doped layers. We demonstrate that while rear AZO can be deleterious when using p-type amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), p-type microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) allows for: (1) suppression of the p-layer/AZO Schottky-like barrier, (2) relevant Voc increase, and (3) improved transport and extraction of carriers. In contrast, Voc reduction and increased low-injection recombination is observed with n-type μc-Si:H in conjunction with AZO, likely due to the low defect density of the material which entails severe depletion effects. These issues are avoided with the more defective mixed-phase n-SiOx, which additionally provides for reduced parasitic absorption losses and is thus established as the optimal emitter choice.

Abstract: Maintaining the high performance of photovoltaic devices requires regular cleaning of panel surfaces because of the environmental dust settlements in harsh weather conditions. Self-cleaning characteristics of such surfaces are vital for the cost effective operations. In the present study, a new fabrication approach is introduced towards self-cleaning applications of optically transparent glasses. In the fabrication process, self-assembly monolayer of silane was coated on the silica nanoparticle layer, prior to oil impregnation, to improve oil hydrodynamic stability of the oil film on the surface. The static water contact angle, sliding angle and average optical transmittance of the resulting surfaces are measured. The scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope are used to reveal the hierarchical morphology of the surface. Dust cleaning tests are performed to evaluate the self-cleaning characteristics of the surfaces. The findings revealed that the water droplets can be effectively used to remove almost all of the dust particles from the surfaces. Oil impregnation improved the optical transmittance of the treated hydrophobic glass surface.

Abstract: We determine the equilibrium concentration of the BO defect in boron-doped Czochralski-grown silicon after prolonged (up to 150h) annealing at relatively low temperatures between 200 and 300°C. We show that after sample processing, the BO concentration has not necessarily reached the equilibrium state. The actually reached state depends on the detailed temperature profile of the last temperature treatment before the light-induced degradation (LID) is performed. For the investigated Cz-Si materials with base resistivities ranging between 0.5 and 2.5Ωcm, we observe that an annealing step at 200°C for 50h establishes the equilibrium, independent of the base resistivity. Experiments performed at different temperatures reveal that the equilibrium defect concentration decreases with increasing annealing temperature. This observation can be understood, assuming a mobile species which is distributed between at least two different sinks. A possible defect model is discussed.

Abstract: This article reported the design and fabrication of bifunctional microcapsules for solar photocatalysis and solar thermal energy storage by using cuprous oxide (Cu2O) as an inorganic shell to encapsulate a paraffin-type phase change material (PCM), n-eicosane. Such a new type of microcapsules was synthesized successfully by using an emulsion templating self-assembly method along with in-situ precipitation. The chemical structures of the resultant microcapsules were determined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and the elemental distributions of microcapsule shell were confirmed by X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X–ray spectroscopy. The scanning and transmission electronic microscopic observations demonstrated that the microstructures and morphologies of microcapsules were influenced significantly by the surfactant and alkali concentrations as well as the portion of cupper source for the synthesis. After the synthetic condition was optimized, the obtained microcapsules exhibited an interesting octahedral morphology and a typical core-shell structure. The thermal analysis results suggested that the microcapsules synthesized at the optimum condition not only obtained high encapsulation and energy-storage efficiencies but also presented a high thermal stability and phase-change reliability. Most of all, the microcapsules obtained a solar thermal energy-storage capability through solar photothermal conversion and also exhibited a high solar photocatalytic activity to organic dyes under the sunlight illumination. In addition, the microcapsules showed a gas-sensitive feature to some harmful organic gases in the presence of Cu2O shell. The microcapsules developed by this work indeed reveal a bifunctional feature derived from both the core and the shell materials and thus show a great potential for industrial and domestic applications due to their extended functions.

Abstract: Polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2) is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family involved in cell-cycle regulation and cellular response to stresses. However, the alteration of Plk2 in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has not been well described. In the present study, we focused on the regulation of Plk2 regulation in response to ER stress. Plk2 expression was dramatically decreased under ER stress induced by brefeldin A (BFA), thapsigargin (TG), or tunicamycin (TM), and this down regulation of Plk2 expression was dependent on activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homology protein (CHOP). Luciferase activity analysis of the truncated Plk2 promoter indicated that regions from −2506 to −1806 and from −1002 to −830 of the Plk2 promoter were sensitive to BFA. Additionally, ChIP and ChIP Re-IP assays showed that CHOP and C/EBPα were assembled on the same region of Plk2 promoter. Notably, we identified two C/EBPα responsive elements at positions −2002 and −948, to which C/EBPα or CHOP binding was enhanced by BFA under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Finally, overexpression of Plk2 inhibits cell apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation in response to ER stress. In summary, these results demonstrated that ER stress plays a crucial role in Plk2 expression. CHOP may up-regulate DNA-binding affinities after BFA treatment, via recruiting C/EBPα to the upstream-promoter of Plk2. These findings may contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of Plk2 regulation.

Abstract: Nowadays there is an intense research for developing alternative thermal energies storage materials, able to work at the 800–1000°C temperature range, for concentrated solar plants. The challenge is wide and extends from different ceramics to natural rocks. In the present work, the aim is first to select representative basaltic rocks from different localities over the Mediterranean basin and close volcanic sites, these going from Tenerife Island up to Egypt. Second, to evaluate the effect of mineralogy, composition and texture of such natural materials on thermal properties during heating process (up to 1000°C). All analyzed basalts are stable over a wide range of temperatures and especially those containing high amounts of MgO and FeO*, since they present valuable physical and chemical potential as being used as thermal storage material in concentrated solar plant operating until 1000°C.

Abstract: Effect of geometrical and structural parameters on the efficiency of the tandem solar cell based on the III-V nanowire array on silicon is studied by the means of coupled opto-electrical simulations. A close to realistic structure, consisting of AlGaAs core-shell nanowire array, connected through a tunnel diode to a Si subcell is modelled, revealing the impact of top contact layer, growth mask and tunnel junction. Optical simulation of the tandem structure under current matching condition determine optimal geometrical parameters of the nanowire array. They are then used in the extensive electrical optimization of the radial junction in the nanowire subcell. Device simulations show the necessity of high doping of the junction in order to avoid full shell depletion. The influence of bulk and surface recombination on the performance of the top subcell is studied, exposing the importance of the good surface passivation near the depleted region of the radial p−n junction. Finally, simulations of the fully optimized tandem structure show that a promising efficiency of η=27.6% with the short-circuit current of JSC=17.1mA/cm2 can be achieved with reasonable bulk and surface carrier lifetime.

Abstract: Recently, organic solar cells have demonstrated high power conversion efficiencies, but extrinsic device stability remains to be a challenge. Often, delamination of the cathode upon water ingress leads to a massive active area loss and to a strong decrease in efficiency. We present highly efficient organic solar cells with an oligothiophene-based donor and two different cathodes. Devices are aged at four different climates under continuous illumination. Al and MoO3/Cr/Al cathodes are compared. Additional interlayers are introduced for enhanced cathode adhesion. Aging in different climates reveals a strong dependency of the degradation speed on absolute humidity for standard Al cathodes. However, using additional interlayers, degradation seems to be almost decoupled from the applied climate and device degradation is slowed immensely. Parallel WVTR measurements of the AlOx barrier allow for the assessment of absolute water quantities until devices are degraded to half of their initial efficiency: 24gm2 are found for standard Al cathodes, while devices with additional interlayers reach 58gm2. This difference is related to a completely different aging behavior, which trades strong short-circuit current density losses for moderate fill-factor losses.
