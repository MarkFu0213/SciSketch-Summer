Abstract: Summary
The lysosome is an acidic multi-functional organelle with roles in macromolecular digestion, nutrient sensing, and signaling. However, why cells require acidic lysosomes to proliferate and which nutrients become limiting under lysosomal dysfunction are unclear. To address this, we performed CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screens and identified cholesterol biosynthesis and iron uptake as essential metabolic pathways when lysosomal pH is altered. While cholesterol synthesis is only necessary, iron is both necessary and sufficient for cell proliferation under lysosomal dysfunction. Remarkably, iron supplementation restores cell proliferation under both pharmacologic and genetic-mediated lysosomal dysfunction. The rescue was independent of metabolic or signaling changes classically associated with increased lysosomal pH, uncoupling lysosomal function from cell proliferation. Finally, our experiments revealed that lysosomal dysfunction dramatically alters mitochondrial metabolism and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling due to iron depletion. Altogether, these findings identify iron homeostasis as the key function of lysosomal acidity for cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Although the association between the microbiome and IBD and liver diseases is known, the cause and effect remain elusive. By connecting human microphysiological systems of the gut, liver, and circulating Treg and Th17 cells, we created a multi-organ model of ulcerative colitis (UC) ex vivo. The approach shows microbiome-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) to either improve or worsen UC severity, depending on the involvement of effector CD4 T cells. Using multiomics, we found SCFAs increased production of ketone bodies, glycolysis, and lipogenesis, while markedly reducing innate immune activation of the UC gut. However, during acute T cell-mediated inflammation, SCFAs exacerbated CD4+ T cell-effector function, partially through metabolic reprograming, leading to gut barrier disruption and hepatic injury. These paradoxical findings underscore the emerging utility of human physiomimetic technology in combination with systems immunology to study causality and the fundamental entanglement of immunity, metabolism, and tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity leads to a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation that features the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in adipose tissue. Here, we determined the role of macrophage lipid-droplet accumulation in the development of obesity-induced adipose-tissue inflammation, using mice with myeloid-specific deficiency of the lipid-inducible HILPDA protein. HILPDA deficiency markedly reduced intracellular lipid levels and accumulation of fluorescently labeled fatty acids. Decreased lipid storage in HILPDA-deficient macrophages can be rescued by inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and is associated with increased oxidative metabolism. In diet-induced obese mice, HILPDA deficiency does not alter inflammatory and metabolic parameters, despite markedly reducing lipid accumulation in macrophages. Overall, we find that HILPDA is a lipid-inducible, physiological inhibitor of ATGL-mediated lipolysis in macrophages and uncouples lipid storage in adipose tissue macrophages from inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. Our data question the contribution of lipid droplet accumulation in adipose tissue macrophages in obesity-induced inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.

Abstract: Summary
The functional relevance and mechanistic basis of the effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) on inflammation remain unclear. Here we reveal that DA inhibited TLR2-induced NF-κB activation and inflammation via the DRD5 receptor in macrophages. We found that the DRD5 receptor, via the EFD and IYX(X)I/L motifs in its CT and IC3 loop, respectively, can directly recruit TRAF6 and its negative regulator ARRB2 to form a multi-protein complex also containing downstream signaling proteins, such as TAK1, IKKs, and PP2A, that impairs TRAF6-mediated activation of NF-κB and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, the DA-DRD5-ARRB2-PP2A signaling axis can prevent S. aureus-induced inflammation and protect mice against S. aureus-induced sepsis and meningitis after DA treatment. Collectively, these findings provide the first demonstration of DA-DRD5 signaling acting to control inflammation and a detailed delineation of the underlying mechanism and identify the DRD5-ARRB2-PP2A axis as a potential target for future therapy of inflammation-associated diseases such as meningitis and sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
An attractive approach to reduce gene expression is via the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that harness the RNase H1 mechanism. Here we show that RNase H ASOs targeted to introns or exons robustly reduce the level of spliced RNA associated with chromatin. Surprisingly, intron-targeted ASOs reduce the level of pre-mRNA associated with chromatin to a greater extent than exon-targeted ASOs. This indicates that exon-targeted ASOs achieve full activity after the pre-mRNA has undergone splicing, but before the mRNA is released from chromatin. Even though RNase H ASOs can reduce the level of RNA associated with chromatin, the effect of ASO-directed RNA degradation on transcription has never been documented. Here we show that intron-targeted ASOs and, to a lesser extent, exon-targeted ASOs cause RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription termination in cultured cells and mice. Furthermore, ASO-directed transcription termination is mediated by the nuclear exonuclease XRN2.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) subdue immune responses. Central to Treg activation are changes in lipid metabolism that support their survival and function. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are a family of lipid chaperones required to facilitate uptake and intracellular lipid trafficking. One family member, FABP5, is expressed in T cells, but its function remains unclear. We show that in Tregs, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of FABP5 function causes mitochondrial changes underscored by decreased OXPHOS, impaired lipid metabolism, and loss of cristae structure. FABP5 inhibition in Tregs triggers mtDNA release and consequent cGAS-STING-dependent type I IFN signaling, which induces heightened production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 and promotes Treg suppressive activity. We find evidence of this pathway, along with correlative mitochondrial changes in tumor infiltrating Tregs, which may underlie enhanced immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Together, our data reveal that FABP5 is a gatekeeper of mitochondrial integrity that modulates Treg function.

Abstract: Summary
Although there are many prospective targets in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), pre-clinical testing is challenging, especially as there is limited information on the murine TME. Here, we characterize the TME of six orthotopic, transplantable syngeneic murine HGSOC lines established from genetic models and compare these to patient biopsies. We identify significant correlations between the transcriptome, host cell infiltrates, matrisome, vasculature, and tissue modulus of mouse and human TMEs, with several stromal and malignant targets in common. However, each model shows distinct differences and potential vulnerabilities that enabled us to test predictions about response to chemotherapy and an anti-IL-6 antibody. Using machine learning, the transcriptional profiles of the mouse tumors that differed in chemotherapy response are able to classify chemotherapy-sensitive and -refractory patient tumors. These models provide useful pre-clinical tools and may help identify subgroups of HGSOC patients who are most likely to respond to specific therapies.

Abstract: Cellular Ca2+ signals are often constrained to cytosolic micro- or nano-domains where stochastic openings of Ca2+ channels cause large fluctuations in local Ca2+ concentration (Ca2+ ‘noise’). With the advent of TIRF microscopy to image the fluorescence of Ca2+-sensitive probes from attoliter volumes it has become possible to directly monitor these signals, which closely track the gating of plasmalemmal and ER Ca2+-permeable channels. Nevertheless, it is likely that many physiologically important Ca2+ signals are too small to resolve as discrete events in fluorescence recordings. By analogy with noise analysis of electrophysiological data, we explore here the use of statistical approaches to detect and analyze such Ca2+ noise in images obtained using Ca2+-sensitive indicator dyes. We describe two techniques - power spectrum analysis and spatio-temporal correlation - and demonstrate that both effectively identify discrete, spatially localized calcium release events (Ca2+ puffs). Moreover, we show they are able to detect localized noise fluctuations in a case where discrete events cannot directly be resolved.

Abstract: Summary
Piezo1 ion channels are activated by mechanical stimuli and mediate the sensing of blood flow. Although cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures have revealed the overall architecture of Piezo1, the precise domains involved in activation and subsequent inactivation have remained elusive. Here, we perform a targeted chimeric screen between Piezo1 and the closely related isoform Piezo2 and use electrophysiology to characterize their inactivation kinetics during mechanical stimulation. We identify three small subdomains within the extracellular cap that individually can confer the distinct kinetics of inactivation of Piezo2 onto Piezo1. We further show by cysteine crosslinking that conformational flexibility of these subdomains is required for mechanical activation to occur and that electrostatic interactions functionally couple the cap to the extensive blades, which have been proposed to function as sensors of membrane curvature and tension. This study provides a demonstration of internal gating motions involved in mechanotransduction by Piezo1.

Abstract: Summary
To understand hindbrain pathways involved in the control of food intake, we examined roles for calcitonin receptor (CALCR)-containing neurons in the NTS. Ablation of NTS Calcr abrogated the long-term suppression of food intake, but not aversive responses, by CALCR agonists. Similarly, activating CalcrNTS neurons decreased food intake and body weight but (unlike neighboring CckNTS cells) failed to promote aversion, revealing that CalcrNTS neurons mediate a non-aversive suppression of food intake. While both CalcrNTS and CckNTS neurons decreased feeding via projections to the PBN, CckNTS cells activated aversive CGRPPBN cells while CalcrNTS cells activated distinct non-CGRP PBN cells. Hence, CalcrNTS cells suppress feeding via non-aversive, non-CGRP PBN targets. Additionally, silencing CalcrNTS cells blunted food intake suppression by gut peptides and nutrients, increasing food intake and promoting obesity. Hence, CalcrNTS neurons define a hindbrain system that participates in physiological energy balance and suppresses food intake without activating aversive systems.

Abstract: Summary
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are abundant in non-lymphoid tissues and increase following infectious and inflammatory insults. In solid tumors, however, ILC2s constitute a relatively small proportion of immune cells. Here, we show, using melanoma as a model, that while the IL-33/IL C2/eosinophil axis suppresses tumor growth, tumor-derived lactate attenuates the function and survival of ILC2s. Melanomas with reduced lactate production (LDHAlow) are growth delayed and typified by an increased number of ILC2s compared with control tumors. Upon IL-33 stimulation, ILC2s accompanied by eosinophils more effectively restrain the growth of LDHAlow tumors than control melanomas. Furthermore, database analysis reveals a negative correlation between the expression of LDHA and markers associated with ILC2s and the association of high expression of IL33 and an eosinophil marker SIGLEC8 with better overall survival in human cutaneous melanoma patients. This work demonstrates that the balance between the IL-33/ILC2/eosinophil axis and lactate production by tumor cells regulates melanoma growth.

Abstract: NF-κB signaling through both canonical and non-canonical pathways plays a central role in immune responses and inflammation. NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK) stabilization is a key step in activation of the non-canonical pathway and its dysregulation implicated in various hematologic malignancies. The tumor suppressor, p53, is an established cellular gatekeeper of proliferation. Abnormalities of the TP53 gene have been detected in more than half of all human cancers. While the non-canonical NF-κB and p53 pathways have been explored for several decades, no studies to date have documented potential cross-talk between these two cancer-related mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that p53 negatively regulates NIK in an miRNA-dependent manner. Overexpression of p53 decreased the levels of NIK, leading to inhibition of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Conversely, its knockdown led to increased levels of NIK, IKKα phosphorylation, and p100 processing. Additionally, miR-34b induced by nutlin-3 directly targeted the coding sequences (CDS) of NIK. Treatment with anti-miR-34b-5p augmented NIK levels and subsequent non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Our collective findings support a novel cross-talk mechanism between non-canonical NF-κB and p53.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient Ca2+ flux induced during cognate T cell activation requires signaling the T cell receptor (TCR) and unidentified G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). T cells express the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R), a GPCR that mediates Ca2+ flux in excitable and non-excitable cells. However, the role of the NK1R in TCR signaling remains unknown. We show that the NK1R and its agonists, the neuropeptides substance P and hemokinin-1, co-localize within the immune synapse during cognate activation of T cells. Simultaneous TCR and NK1R stimulation is necessary for efficient Ca2+ flux and Ca2+-dependent signaling that sustains the survival of activated T cells and helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 bias. In a model of contact dermatitis, mice with T cells deficient in NK1R or its agonists exhibit impaired cellular immunity, due to high mortality of activated T cells. We demonstrate an effect of the NK1R in T cells that is relevant for immunotherapies based on pro-inflammatory neuropeptides and its receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) exhibit high levels of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription and ribosome biogenesis. Here, we reveal an unexpected role for an essential DEAD-box helicase, DDX18, in antagonizing the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to prevent deposition of the repressive H3K27me3 mark onto rDNA in pluripotent cells. DDX18 binds and sequesters PRC2 in the outer layer of the nucleolus and counteracts PRC2 complex formation in vivo and in vitro. DDX18 knockdown leads to increased occupancy of PRC2 and H3K27me3 at rDNA loci, accompanied by drastically decreased rRNA transcription and reduced ribosomal protein expression and translation. Auxin-induced rapid degradation of DDX18 enhances PRC2 binding at rDNA. The inhibition of PRC2 partially rescues the effects of DDX18 depletion on rRNA transcription and ESC self-renewal. These results demonstrate a critical role for DDX18 in safeguarding the chromatin and transcriptional integrity of rDNA by counteracting the epigenetic silencing machinery to promote pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by the accumulation of hepatic fat in an inflammatory/fibrotic background. Herein, we show that the hepatic high-activity glutaminase 1 isoform (GLS1) is overexpressed in NASH. Importantly, GLS1 inhibition reduces lipid content in choline and/or methionine deprivation-induced steatotic mouse primary hepatocytes, in human hepatocyte cell lines, and in NASH mouse livers. We suggest that under these circumstances, defective glutamine fueling of anaplerotic mitochondrial metabolism and concomitant reduction of oxidative stress promotes a reprogramming of serine metabolism, wherein serine is shifted from the generation of the antioxidant glutathione and channeled to provide one-carbon units to regenerate the methionine cycle. The restored methionine cycle can induce phosphatidylcholine synthesis from the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase-mediated and CDP-choline pathways as well as by base-exchange reactions between phospholipids, thereby restoring hepatic phosphatidylcholine content and very-low-density lipoprotein export. Overall, we provide evidence that hepatic GLS1 targeting is a valuable therapeutic approach in NASH.

Abstract: Summary
The induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is highly desired for an effective vaccine against HIV-1. Typically, bnAbs develop in patients with high viremia, but they can also evolve in some untreated HIV-1 controllers with low viral loads. Here, we identify a subgroup of neutralizer-controllers characterized by myeloid DCs (mDCs) with a distinct inflammatory signature and a superior ability to prime T follicular helper (Tfh)-like cells in an STAT4-dependent fashion. This distinct immune profile is associated with a higher frequency of Tfh-like cells in peripheral blood (pTfh) and an enrichment for Tfh-defining genes in circulating CD4+ T cells. Correspondingly, monocytes from this neutralizer controller subgroup upregulate genes encoding for chemotaxis and inflammation, and they secrete high levels of IL-12 in response to TLR stimulation. Our results suggest the existence of multi-compartment immune networks between mDCs, Tfh, and monocytes that may facilitate the development of bnAbs in a subgroup of HIV-1 controllers.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic changes are increasingly being appreciated as key events in breast cancer progression. However, breast cancer subtype-specific epigenetic regulation remains poorly investigated. Here we report that EZH2 is a leading candidate of epigenetic modulators associated with the TNBC subtype and that it predicts poor overall survival in TNBC patients. We demonstrate that specific pharmacological or genetic inhibition of EZH2 catalytic activity impairs distant metastasis. We further define a specific EZH2high population with enhanced invasion, mammosphere formation, and metastatic potential that exhibits marked sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition. Mechanistically, EZH2 inhibition differentiates EZH2high basal cells to a luminal-like phenotype by derepressing GATA3 and renders them sensitive to endocrine therapy. Furthermore, dissection of human TNBC heterogeneity shows that EZH2high basal-like 1 and mesenchymal subtypes have exquisite sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition compared with the EZH2low luminal androgen receptor subtype.

Abstract: Summary
Neurotransmitters often have multiple receptors that induce distinct responses in receiving cells. Expression and localization of neurotransmitter receptors in individual neurons are therefore critical for understanding the operation of neural circuits. Here we describe a comprehensive library of reporter strains in which a convertible T2A-GAL4 cassette is inserted into endogenous neurotransmitter receptor genes of Drosophila. Using this library, we profile the expression of 75 neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Cluster analysis reveals neurochemical segmentation of the brain, distinguishing higher brain centers from the rest. By recombinase-mediated cassette exchange, we convert T2A-GAL4 into split-GFP and Tango to visualize subcellular localization and activation of dopamine receptors in specific cell types. This reveals striking differences in their subcellular localization, which may underlie the distinct cellular responses to dopamine in different behavioral contexts. Our resources thus provide a versatile toolkit for dissecting the cellular organization and function of neurotransmitter systems in the fly brain.

Abstract: Summary
During the 2013–2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic, a significant number of patients admitted to Ebola treatment units were co-infected with Plasmodium falciparum, a predominant agent of malaria. However, there is no consensus on how malaria impacts EBOV infection. The effect of acute Plasmodium infection on EBOV challenge was investigated using mouse-adapted EBOV and a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) model virus. We demonstrate that acute Plasmodium infection protects from lethal viral challenge, dependent upon interferon gamma (IFN-γ) elicited as a result of parasite infection. Plasmodium-infected mice lacking the IFN-γ receptor are not protected. Ex vivo incubation of naive human or mouse macrophages with sera from acutely parasitemic rodents or macaques programs a proinflammatory phenotype dependent on IFN-γ and renders cells resistant to EBOV infection. We conclude that acute Plasmodium infection can safeguard against EBOV by the production of protective IFN-γ. These findings have implications for anti-malaria therapies administered during episodic EBOV outbreaks in Africa.

Abstract: Summary
A strong GABAergic tone imposes sparse levels of activity in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. This balance is challenged by the addition of new granule cells (GCs) with high excitability. How developing GCs integrate within local inhibitory networks remains unknown. We used optogenetics to study synaptogenesis between new GCs and GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV-INs) and somatostatin (SST-INs). PV-INs target the soma, and synapses become mature after 6 weeks. This transition is accelerated by exposure to an enriched environment. PV-INs exert efficient control of GC spiking and participate in both feedforward and feedback loops, a mechanism that would favor lateral inhibition and sparse coding. SST-INs target the dendrites, and synapses mature after 8 weeks. Outputs from GCs onto PV-INs develop faster than those onto SST-INs. Our results reveal a long-lasting transition wherein adult-born neurons remain poorly coupled to inhibition, which might enhance activity-dependent plasticity of input and output synapses.

Abstract: Summary
Postprandial hypoglycemia is a disabling complication of the treatment of obesity by gastric bypass surgery. So far, no therapy exists, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we hypothesized that glucose-induced IL-1β leads to an exaggerated insulin response in this condition. Therefore, we conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study with the SGLT2-inhibitor empagliflozin and the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03200782; n = 12). Both drugs reduced postprandial insulin release and prevented hypoglycemia (symptomatic events requiring rescue glucose: placebo = 7/12, empagliflozin = 2/12, and anakinra = 2/12, pvallikelihood ratio test (LRT) = 0.013; nadir blood glucose for placebo = 2.4 mmol/L, 95% CI 2.18–2.62, empagliflozin = 2.69 mmol/L, 95% CI 2.31–3.08, and anakinra = 2.99 mmol/L, 95% CI 2.43–3.55, pvalLRT = 0.048). Moreover, analysis of monocytes ex vivo revealed a hyper-reactive inflammatory state that has features of an exaggerated response to a meal. Our study proposes a role for glucose-induced IL-1β in postprandial hypoglycemia after gastric bypass surgery and suggests that SGLT2-inhibitors and IL-1 antagonism may improve this condition.

Abstract: Summary
How ubiquitous transcription factors (TFs) coordinate temporal inputs from broadly expressed epigenetic factors to control cell fate remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover a molecular relationship between p53, an abundant embryonic TF, and WDR5, an essential member of the MLL chromatin modifying complex, that regulates mouse embryonic stem cell fate. Wild-type Wdr5 or transient Wdr5 knockout promotes a distinct pattern of global chromatin accessibility and spurs neuroectodermal differentiation through an RbBP5-dependent process in which WDR5 binds to, and activates transcription of, neural genes. Wdr5 rescue after its prolonged inhibition targets WDR5 to mesoderm lineage-specifying genes, stimulating differentiation toward mesoderm fates in a p53-dependent fashion. Finally, we identify a direct interaction between WDR5 and p53 that enables their co-recruitment to, and regulation of, genes known to control cell proliferation and fate. Our results unmask p53-dependent mechanisms that temporally integrate epigenetic WDR5 inputs to drive neuroectoderm and mesoderm differentiation from pluripotent cells.

Abstract: Summary
Determining cell types is critical for understanding neural circuits but remains elusive in the living human brain. Current approaches discriminate units into putative cell classes using features of the extracellular action potential (EAP); in absence of ground truth data, this remains a problematic procedure. We find that EAPs in deep structures of the brain exhibit robust and systematic variability during the cardiac cycle. These cardiac-related features refine neural classification. We use these features to link bio-realistic models generated from in vitro human whole-cell recordings of morphologically classified neurons to in vivo recordings. We differentiate aspiny inhibitory and spiny excitatory human hippocampal neurons and, in a second stage, demonstrate that cardiac-motion features reveal two types of spiny neurons with distinct intrinsic electrophysiological properties and phase-locking characteristics to endogenous oscillations. This multi-modal approach markedly improves cell classification in humans, offers interpretable cell classes, and is applicable to other brain areas and species.

Abstract: Summary
In the neocortex, synaptic inhibition shapes all forms of spontaneous and sensory evoked activity. Importantly, inhibitory transmission is highly plastic, but the functional role of inhibitory synaptic plasticity is unknown. In the mouse barrel cortex, activation of layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) elicits strong feedforward inhibition (FFI) onto L5 PNs. We find that FFI involving parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cells is strongly potentiated by postsynaptic PN burst firing. FFI plasticity modifies the PN excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) ratio, strongly modulates PN gain, and alters information transfer across cortical layers. Moreover, our LTPi-inducing protocol modifies firing of L5 PNs and alters the temporal association of PN spikes to γ-oscillations both in vitro and in vivo. All of these effects are captured by unbalancing the E/I ratio in a feedforward inhibition circuit model. Altogether, our results indicate that activity-dependent modulation of perisomatic inhibitory strength effectively influences the participation of single principal cortical neurons to cognition-relevant network activity.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapy for inflammatory diseases involves paracrine and efferocytotic activation of immunosuppressive interleukin-10+ (IL-10+) macrophages. The paracrine pathway for MSC-mediated IL-10+ macrophage functionality and response to tissue injury is not fully understood. In our present study, clodronate pre-treatment of colitic mice confirms the essential role of endogenous macrophages in bone-marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC)-mediated clinical rescue of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. We identify that BM-MSC-secreted chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) cooperate as a heterodimer to upregulate IL-10 expression in CCR2+ macrophages in vitro and that CCL2 expression by MSC is required for IL-10+ polarization of intestinal and peritoneal resident macrophages in vivo. We observe that tissue macrophage IL-10 polarization in vivo is widespread involving extra-intestinal tissues and secondarily leads to bystander IL-10 expression in intestine-resident B and T cells. In conclusion, the BM-MSC-derived chemokine interactome dictates an IL-10+-macrophage-amplified anti-inflammatory response in toxic colitis.

Abstract: Summary
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes diseases in individuals with immature or compromised immunity. To evade immune control, HCMV evolved numerous antagonists targeting the interferon system at multiple levels. By comparative analysis of naturally arising variants of the most widely studied HCMV strain, AD169, and a panel of targeted mutants, we uncover the UL145 gene as indispensable for STAT2 downregulation. Ribosome profiling confirms the translation of the canonical pUL145 protein (pUL145-Long) and newly identifies a shorter isoform (pUL145-Short). Both isoforms recruit DDB1-containing ubiquitin ligases to induce proteasomal degradation of STAT2. An alanine-scanning mutagenesis discloses the DDB1 interaction motif of pUL145 that resembles the DDB1-binding interface of cellular substrate receptors of DDB1-containing ubiquitin ligases. Thus, pUL145 constitutes a viral DDB1-cullin-associated factor (vDCAF), which mimics cellular DCAFs to exploit the ubiquitin-proteasome system to impede antiviral immunity. Notably, the viral exploitation of the cullins can be targeted to restore the efficacy of the host immune response.

Abstract: Transient Receptor Potential channels from the vanilloid subfamily (TRPV) are a group of cation channels modulated by a variety of endogenous stimuli as well as a range of natural and synthetic compounds. Their roles in human health make them of keen interest, particularly from a pharmacological perspective. However, despite this interest, the complexity of these channels has made it difficult to obtain high resolution structures until recently. With the cryo-EM resolution revolution, TRPV channel structural biology has blossomed to produce dozens of structures, covering every TRPV family member and a variety of approaches to examining channel modulation. Here, we review all currently available TRPV structures and the mechanistic insights into gating that they reveal.

Abstract: Summary
Propionic acid (PA) is a bacterium-derived intestinal antimicrobial and immune modulator used widely in food production and agriculture. Passage of Crohn’s disease-associated adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) through a murine model, in which intestinal PA levels are increased to mimic the human intestine, leads to the recovery of AIEC with significantly increased virulence. Similar phenotypic changes are observed outside the murine model when AIEC is grown in culture with PA as the sole carbon source; such PA exposure also results in AIEC that persists at 20-fold higher levels in vivo. RNA sequencing identifies an upregulation of genes involved in biofilm formation, stress response, metabolism, membrane integrity, and alternative carbon source utilization. PA exposure also increases virulence in a number of E. coli isolates from Crohn’s disease patients. Removal of PA is sufficient to reverse these phenotypic changes. Our data indicate that exposure to PA results in AIEC resistance and increased virulence in its presence.

Abstract: Summary
The neurotransmitter dopamine, which acts via the D1-like receptor (D1R) and D2-like receptor (D2R) family, may play an important role in gating sensory information to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We tested this hypothesis in awake macaques and recorded visual motion-direction tuning functions of single PFC neurons. Using micro-iontophoretic drug application combined with single-unit recordings, we simulated receptor-specific dopaminergic input to the PFC and explored cellular gating mechanisms. We find that stimulating D1Rs, and particularly D2Rs, enhances the single-neuron and population coding quality in PFC neurons. D2R stimulation causes a clear increase of the neurons’ responses to the preferred motion direction and a decrease to the non-preferred motion direction, thus enhancing neuronal signal-to-noise ratio. Neither D1R nor D2R stimulation had any impact on the neurons’ tuning sharpness. These results elucidate the mechanisms of how receptor-specific dopamine effects can act as a gating signal that enables privileged access of sensory information to PFC circuits.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of translation during human development is poorly understood, and its dysregulation is associated with Rett syndrome (RTT). To discover shifts in mRNA ribosomal engagement (RE) during human neurodevelopment, we use parallel translating ribosome affinity purification sequencing (TRAP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on control and RTT human induced pluripotent stem cells, neural progenitor cells, and cortical neurons. We find that 30% of transcribed genes are translationally regulated, including key gene sets (neurodevelopment, transcription and translation factors, and glycolysis). Approximately 35% of abundant intergenic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are ribosome engaged. Neurons translate mRNAs more efficiently and have longer 3ʹ UTRs, and RE correlates with elements for RNA-binding proteins. RTT neurons have reduced global translation and compromised mTOR signaling, and >2,100 genes are translationally dysregulated. NEDD4L E3-ubiquitin ligase is translationally impaired, ubiquitinated protein levels are reduced, and protein targets accumulate in RTT neurons. Overall, the dynamic translatome in neurodevelopment is disturbed in RTT and provides insight into altered ubiquitination that may have therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake depends on the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, a highly selective channel of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Here, we screen a library of 44,000 non-proprietary compounds for their ability to modulate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Two of them, named MCU-i4 and MCU-i11, are confirmed to reliably decrease mitochondrial Ca2+ influx. Docking simulations reveal that these molecules directly bind a specific cleft in MICU1, a key element of the MCU complex that controls channel gating. Accordingly, in MICU1-silenced or deleted cells, the inhibitory effect of the two compounds is lost. Moreover, MCU-i4 and MCU-i11 fail to inhibit mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in cells expressing a MICU1 mutated in the critical amino acids that forge the predicted binding cleft. Finally, these compounds are tested ex vivo, revealing a primary role for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in muscle growth. Overall, MCU-i4 and MCU-i11 represent leading molecules for the development of MICU1-targeting drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Every-other-day fasting (EODF) is an effective intervention for the treatment of metabolic disease, including improvements in liver health. But how the liver proteome is reprogrammed by EODF is currently unknown. Here, we use EODF in mice and multi-omics analysis to identify regulated pathways. Many changes in the liver proteome are distinct after EODF and absent after a single fasting bout. Key among these is the simultaneous induction by EODF of de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation enzymes. Together with activation of oxidative stress defenses, this contributes to the improvements in glucose tolerance and lifespan after EODF. Enrichment analysis shows unexpected downregulation of HNF4α targets by EODF, and we confirm HNF4α inhibition. Suppressed HNF4α targets include bile synthetic enzymes and secreted proteins, such as α1-antitrypsin or inflammatory factors, which reflect EODF phenotypes. Interactive online access is provided to a data resource (https://www.larancelab.com/eodf), which provides a global view of fasting-induced mechanisms in mice.

Abstract: Previous reports suggest that oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) are expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium in primates. Oxytocinergic signaling activates the Rho-ROCK pathway, which reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton and alters other cellular biophysical characteristics. Such changes could be involved in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition and development of proliferative vitreous retinopathy. Here, we investigated whether oxytocin (OXT) binding to OXTRs in the retinal pigment epithelium can induce Rho-ROCK-mediated cellular activity. We performed four different assays of Rho-ROCK signaling in a human retinal pigment epithelium cell line (ARPE-19) such as induction of actin fibers, wound healing, cell growth, and collagen gel contraction. The assays were performed with or without OXT (100 nM) exposure, as well as with exposure to ripasudil, a specific ROCK inhibitor. The actin stress fiber formation, a phenotype mediated by activated Rho GTPase, was induced by OXT. OXT also accelerated wound closure 19 h after administration, increased cell growth 24 h afterwards, and induced stronger collagen gel contractions. All four cellular responses were inhibited with the addition of 50 μM ripasudil. Taken together, OXT-mediated activation of Rho-ROCK signal transduction could play a role in regulating epithelial–mesenchymal transition in the retinal pigment epithelium, and increase the possibility of subsequent proliferative vitreous retinopathy after vitrectomy.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) express high levels of cell surface lymphotoxin alpha beta (LTα1β2) to activate the LT beta receptor (LTβR) on the lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), modulating LEC adhesion molecules, intercellular junctions, and chemokines. We demonstrate a role for Tregs through this pathway to condition the permissiveness of lymphatic endothelia for transendothelial migration (TEM), thus gating leukocyte traffic. Human Tregs share the same property with murine Tregs. Activation of TLR2 on Tregs during inflammation specifically augments LTα1β2-LTβR signaling, which further enhances the permissiveness of LECs to facilitate TEM. The conditioning of endothelia may promote the resolution of inflammation by directing leukocytes out of tissues to lymphatic vessels and draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Thus, Tregs interact with lymphatic endothelia under homeostasis and inflammation and dictate endothelial permissiveness and gating mechanisms for subsequent leukocyte migration through endothelial barriers.

Abstract: Summary
The development of neuronal circuits requires both hard-wired gene expression and experience-dependent plasticity. Sensory processing, such as binocular vision, is especially sensitive to perturbations of experience. We investigated the experience-dependent development of the binocular visual cortex at single-cell resolution by using two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice. At eye-opening, the majority of visually responsive neurons are monocular. Binocular neurons emerge later with visual experience and acquire distinct visual response properties. Surprisingly, rather than mirroring the effects of visual deprivation, mice that lack the plasticity gene Arc show increased numbers of binocular neurons and a shift in ocular dominance during development. Strikingly, acutely removing Arc in the adult binocular visual cortex also increases the number of binocular neurons, suggesting that the maintenance of binocular circuits requires ongoing plasticity. Thus, experience-dependent plasticity is critical for the development and maintenance of circuits required to process binocular vision.

Abstract: Summary
Almost all life forms can detect and decode light information for adaptive advantage. Examples include the visual system, in which photoreceptor signals are processed into virtual images, and the circadian system, in which light entrains a physiological clock. Here we describe a light response pathway in mice that employs encephalopsin (OPN3, a 480 nm, blue-light-responsive opsin) to regulate the function of adipocytes. Germline null and adipocyte-specific conditional null mice show a light- and Opn3-dependent deficit in thermogenesis and become hypothermic upon cold exposure. We show that stimulating mouse adipocytes with blue light enhances the lipolysis response and, in particular, phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase. This response is Opn3 dependent. These data establish a key mechanism in which light-dependent, local regulation of the lipolysis response in white adipocytes regulates energy metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) are common, with five main histological subtypes: lactotroph, somatotroph, and thyrotroph (POU1F1/PIT1 lineage); corticotroph (TBX19/TPIT lineage); and gonadotroph (NR5A1/SF1 lineage). We report a comprehensive pangenomic classification of PitNETs. PitNETs from POU1F1/PIT1 lineage showed an epigenetic signature of diffuse DNA hypomethylation, with transposable elements expression and chromosomal instability (except for GNAS-mutated somatotrophs). In TPIT lineage, corticotrophs were divided into three classes: the USP8-mutated with overt secretion, the USP8-wild-type with increased invasiveness and increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the large silent tumors with gonadotroph transdifferentiation. Unexpected expression of gonadotroph markers was also found in GNAS-wild-type somatotrophs (SF1 expression), challenging the current definition of SF1/gonadotroph lineage. This classification improves our understanding and affects the clinical stratification of patients with PitNETs.

Abstract: Summary
The Mec1 and Rad53 kinases play a central role during acute replication stress in budding yeast. They are also essential for viability in normal growth conditions, but the signal that activates the Mec1-Rad53 pathway in the absence of exogenous insults is currently unknown. Here, we show that this pathway is active at the onset of normal S phase because deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) levels present in G1 phase may not be sufficient to support processive DNA synthesis and impede DNA replication. This activation can be suppressed experimentally by increasing dNTP levels in G1 phase. Moreover, we show that unchallenged cells entering S phase in the absence of Rad53 undergo irreversible fork collapse and mitotic catastrophe. Together, these data indicate that cells use suboptimal dNTP pools to detect the onset of DNA replication and activate the Mec1-Rad53 pathway, which in turn maintains functional forks and triggers dNTP synthesis, allowing the completion of DNA replication.

Abstract: Summary
Growing evidence supports the importance of gut microbiota in the control of tumor growth and response to therapy. Here, we select prebiotics that can enrich bacterial taxa that promote anti-tumor immunity. Addition of the prebiotics inulin or mucin to the diet of C57BL/6 mice induces anti-tumor immune responses and inhibition of BRAF mutant melanoma growth in a subcutaneously implanted syngeneic mouse model. Mucin fails to inhibit tumor growth in germ-free mice, indicating that the gut microbiota is required for the activation of the anti-tumor immune response. Inulin and mucin drive distinct changes in the microbiota, as inulin, but not mucin, limits tumor growth in syngeneic mouse models of colon cancer and NRAS mutant melanoma and enhances the efficacy of a MEK inhibitor against melanoma while delaying the emergence of drug resistance. We highlight the importance of gut microbiota in anti-tumor immunity and the potential therapeutic role for prebiotics in this process.

Abstract: The cell wall polymers wall teichoic acid (WTA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) are often modified with glycosyl and D-alanine residues. Recent studies have shown that a three-component glycosylation system is used for the modification of LTA in several Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes. In the L. monocytogenes 1/2a strain 10403S, the cytoplasmic glycosyltransferase GtlA is thought to use UDP-galactose to produce the C55-P-galactose lipid intermediate, which is transported across the membrane by an unknown flippase. Next, the galactose residue is transferred onto the LTA backbone on the outside of the cell by the glycosyltransferase GtlB. Here we show that GtcA is necessary for the glycosylation of LTA in L. monocytogenes 10403S and B. subtilis 168 and we hypothesize that these proteins act as C55-P-sugar flippases. With this we revealed that GtcA is involved in the glycosylation of both teichoic acid polymers in L. monocytogenes 10403S, namely WTA with N-acetylglucosamine and LTA with galactose residues. These findings indicate that the L. monocytogenes GtcA protein can act on different C55-P-sugar intermediates. Further characterization of GtcA in L. monocytogenes led to the identification of residues essential for its overall function as well as residues, which predominately impact WTA or LTA glycosylation.

Abstract: Summary
The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex is a DNA double-strand break sensor that mediates a tumor-suppressive DNA damage response (DDR) in cells undergoing oncogenic stress, yet the mechanisms underlying this effect are poorly understood. Using a genetically inducible primary mammary epithelial cell model, we demonstrate that Mre11 suppresses proliferation and DNA damage induced by diverse oncogenic drivers through a p53-independent mechanism. Breast tumorigenesis models engineered to express a hypomorphic Mre11 allele exhibit increased levels of oncogene-induced DNA damage, R-loop accumulation, and chromosomal instability with a characteristic copy number loss phenotype. Mre11 complex dysfunction is identified in a subset of human triple-negative breast cancers and is associated with increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging therapy and inhibitors of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Thus, deficiencies in the Mre11-dependent DDR drive proliferation and genome instability patterns in p53-deficient breast cancers and represent an opportunity for therapeutic exploitation.

Abstract: Summary
Liquid-liquid phase separation is an increasingly recognized mechanism for compartmentalization in cells. Recent in vitro studies suggest that this organizational principle may apply to synaptic vesicle clusters. Here we test this possibility by performing microinjections at the living lamprey giant reticulospinal synapse. Axons are maintained at rest to examine whether reagents introduced into the cytosol enter a putative liquid phase to disrupt critical protein-protein interactions. Compounds that perturb the intrinsically disordered region of synapsin, which is critical for liquid phase organization in vitro, cause dispersion of synaptic vesicles from resting clusters. Reagents that perturb SH3 domain interactions with synapsin are ineffective at rest. Our results indicate that synaptic vesicles at a living central synapse are organized as a distinct liquid phase maintained by interactions via the intrinsically disordered region of synapsin.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) suffer frequent infections that account for significant morbidity and mortality. T cell cytotoxic responses are decreased in patients with SLE, yet the responsible molecular events are largely unknown. We find an expanded CD8CD38high T cell subset in a subgroup of patients with increased rates of infections. CD8CD38high T cells from healthy subjects and patients with SLE display decreased cytotoxic capacity, degranulation, and expression of granzymes A and B and perforin. The key cytotoxicity-related transcription factors T-bet, RUNX3, and EOMES are decreased in CD8CD38high T cells. CD38 leads to increased acetylated EZH2 through inhibition of the deacetylase Sirtuin1. Acetylated EZH2 represses RUNX3 expression, whereas inhibition of EZH2 restores CD8 T cell cytotoxic responses. We propose that high levels of CD38 lead to decreased CD8 T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and increased propensity to infections in patients with SLE, a process that can be reversed pharmacologically.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic DNA replication licensing is a prerequisite for, and plays a role in, regulating genome duplication that occurs exactly once per cell cycle. ORC (origin recognition complex) binds to and marks replication origins throughout the cell cycle and loads other replication-initiation proteins onto replication origins to form pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs), completing replication licensing. However, how an asymmetric single-heterohexameric ORC structure loads the symmetric MCM (minichromosome maintenance) double hexamers is controversial, and importantly, it remains unknown when and how ORC proteins associate with the newly replicated origins to protect them from invasion by histones. Here, we report an essential and cell-cycle-dependent ORC “dimerization cycle” that plays three fundamental roles in the regulation of DNA replication: providing a symmetric platform to load the symmetric pre-RCs, marking and protecting the nascent sister replication origins for the next licensing, and playing a crucial role to prevent origin re-licensing within the same cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved patient survival in melanoma, but the innate resistance of many patients necessitates the investigation of alternative immune targets. Many immune checkpoint proteins lack proper characterization, including V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA). VISTA expression on immune cells can suppress T cell activity; however, few studies have investigated its expression and regulation in cancer cells. In this study, we observe that VISTA is expressed in melanoma patient samples and cell lines. Tumor cell-specific expression of VISTA promotes tumor onset in vivo, associated with increased intratumoral T regulatory cells, and enhanced PDL-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating macrophages. VISTA transcript levels are regulated by the stemness factor Forkhead box D3 (FOXD3). BRAF inhibition upregulates FOXD3 and reduces VISTA expression. Overall, this study demonstrates melanoma cell expression of VISTA and its regulation by FOXD3, contributing to the rationale for therapeutic strategies that combine targeted inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor p53 plays a critical role in integrating a wide variety of stress responses. Therefore, p53 levels are precisely regulated by multiple ubiquitin ligases. In this study, we report that FBXW7, a substrate recognition component of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) E3 ligase, interacts with and targets p53 for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation after exposure to ionizing radiation or etoposide. Mechanistically, DNA damage activates ATM to phosphorylate p53 on Ser33 and Ser37, which facilitates the FBXW7 binding and subsequent p53 degradation by SCFFBXW7. Inactivation of ATM or SCFFBXW7 by small molecular inhibitors or genetic knockdown/knockout approaches extends the p53 protein half-life upon DNA damage in an MDM2-independent manner. Biologically, FBXW7 inactivation sensitizes cancer cells to radiation or etoposide by stabilizing p53 to induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, our study elucidates a mechanism by which FBXW7 confers cancer cell survival during radiotherapy or chemotherapy via p53 targeting.

Abstract: Summary
The antidiabetic drug phenformin displays potent anticancer activity in different tumors, but its mechanism of action remains elusive. Using Shh medulloblastoma as model, we show here that at clinically relevant concentrations, phenformin elicits a significant therapeutic effect through a redox-dependent but complex I-independent mechanism. Phenformin inhibits mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD), a component of the glycerophosphate shuttle, and causes elevations of intracellular NADH content. Inhibition of mGPD mimics phenformin action and promotes an association between corepressor CtBP2 and Gli1, thereby inhibiting Hh transcriptional output and tumor growth. Because ablation of CtBP2 abrogates the therapeutic effect of phenformin in mice, these data illustrate a biguanide-mediated redox/corepressor interplay, which may represent a relevant target for tumor therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant macrophage activation during intracellular infection generates immunopathologies that can cause severe human morbidity. A better understanding of immune subversion strategies and macrophage phenotypic and functional responses is necessary to design host-directed intervention strategies. Here, we uncover a fine-tuned transcriptional response that is induced in primary and lesional macrophages infected by the parasite Leishmania amazonensis and dampens NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Subversion is amastigote-specific and characterized by a decreased expression of activating and increased expression of de-activating components of these pro-inflammatory pathways, thus revealing a regulatory dichotomy that abrogates the anti-microbial response. Changes in transcript abundance correlate with histone H3K9/14 hypoacetylation and H3K4 hypo-trimethylation in infected primary and lesional macrophages at promoters of NF-κB-related, pro-inflammatory genes. Our results reveal a Leishmania immune subversion strategy targeting host cell epigenetic regulation to establish conditions beneficial for parasite survival and open avenues for host-directed, anti-microbial drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Low protein synthesis is a feature of somatic stem cells that promotes regeneration in multiple tissues. Modest increases in protein synthesis impair stem cell function, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are largely unknown. We determine that low protein synthesis within hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is associated with elevated proteome quality in vivo. HSCs contain less misfolded and unfolded proteins than myeloid progenitors. Increases in protein synthesis cause HSCs to accumulate misfolded and unfolded proteins. To test how proteome quality affects HSCs, we examine Aarssti/sti mice that harbor a tRNA editing defect that increases amino acid misincorporation. Aarssti/sti mice exhibit reduced HSC numbers, increased proliferation, and diminished serial reconstituting activity. Misfolded proteins overwhelm the proteasome within Aarssti/sti HSCs, which is associated with increased c-Myc abundance. Deletion of one Myc allele partially rescues serial reconstitution defects in Aarssti/sti HSCs. Thus, HSCs are dependent on low protein synthesis to maintain proteostasis, which promotes their self-renewal.

Abstract: Summary
Caloric restriction (CR) improves survival in nonhuman primates and delays the onset of age-related morbidities including sarcopenia, which is characterized by the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. A shift in metabolism anticipates the onset of muscle-aging phenotypes in nonhuman primates, suggesting a potential role for metabolism in the protective effects of CR. Here, we show that CR induced profound changes in muscle composition and the cellular metabolic environment. Bioinformatic analysis linked these adaptations to proteostasis, RNA processing, and lipid synthetic pathways. At the tissue level, CR maintained contractile content and attenuated age-related metabolic shifts among individual fiber types with higher mitochondrial activity, altered redox metabolism, and smaller lipid droplet size. Biometric and metabolic rate data confirm preserved metabolic efficiency in CR animals that correlated with the attenuation of age-related muscle mass and physical activity. These data suggest that CR-induced reprogramming of metabolism plays a role in delayed aging of skeletal muscle in rhesus monkeys.

Abstract: The suppressive roles of limonin have been established in various tumors. However, its roles in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) progression are still confusing. This work aims to explore limonin-mediated effects on OTSCC progression. CCK8 analysis was performed to evaluate limonin-mediated effects on OTSCC cell viability. Wound healing and transwell invasion analysis were constructed to examine the effects of limonin on OTSCC cell migration and invasion capacity. RT-qPCR, western blot and luciferase reporter assays were used to explore the underlying mechanisms contributing to limonin-mediated effects on OTSCC progression. It was found that limonin significantly suppressed the viability of OTSCC cells. Additionally, limonin reduced the migration and invasion ability of OTSCC cells. Mechanistically, limonin suppresses OTSCC progression by promoting the nuclear to cytoplasm translocation of YAP, decreasing YAP protein expression and subsequently decreasing YAP transcriptional regulatory activity, this is responsible for limonin-mediated suppression on OTSCC progression. Thus, this work suggests that limonin suppresses OTSCC progression through inhibiting YAP transcriptional regulatory activity.

Overtly self-reactive T cells are removed during thymic selection. However, it has been recently established that T cell self-reactivity promotes protective immune responses. Apparently, the level of self-reactivity of mature T cells must be tightly balanced. Our mathematical model and experimental data show that the dynamic regulation of CD4- and CD8-LCK coupling establish the self-reactivity of the peripheral T cell pool. The stoichiometry of the interaction between CD8 and LCK, but not between CD4 and LCK, substantially increases upon T cell maturation. As a result, peripheral CD8+ T cells are more self-reactive than CD4+ T cells. The different levels of self-reactivity of mature CD8+ and CD4+ T cells likely reflect the unique roles of these subsets in immunity. These results indicate that the evolutionary selection pressure tuned the CD4-LCK and CD8-LCK stoichiometries, as they represent the unique parts of the proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, which differ between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity has been associated with cognitive decline, atrophy of brain regions related to learning and memory, and higher risk of developing dementia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these neurological alterations are still largely unknown. Here, we investigate the effects of palmitate, a saturated fatty acid present at high amounts in fat-rich diets, in the brain. Palmitate is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of overweight and obese patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. In mice, intracerebroventricular infusion of palmitate impairs synaptic plasticity and memory. Palmitate induces astroglial and microglial activation in the mouse hippocampus, and its deleterious impact is mediated by microglia-derived tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) signaling. Our results establish that obesity is associated with increases in CSF palmitate. By defining a pro-inflammatory mechanism by which abnormal levels of palmitate in the brain impair memory, the results further suggest that anti-inflammatory strategies may attenuate memory impairment in obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Plasma membrane damage and cell death during processes such as necroptosis and apoptosis result from cues originating intracellularly. However, death caused by pore-forming agents, like bacterial toxins or complement, is due to direct external injury to the plasma membrane. To prevent death, the plasma membrane has an intrinsic repair ability. Here, we found that repair triggered by pore-forming agents involved TMEM16F, a calcium-activated lipid scramblase also mutated in Scott’s syndrome. Upon pore formation and the subsequent influx of intracellular calcium, TMEM16F induced rapid “lipid scrambling” in the plasma membrane. This response was accompanied by membrane blebbing, extracellular vesicle release, preserved membrane integrity, and increased cell viability. TMEM16F-deficient mice exhibited compromised control of infection by Listeria monocytogenes associated with a greater sensitivity of neutrophils to the pore-forming Listeria toxin listeriolysin O (LLO). Thus, the lipid scramblase TMEM16F is critical for plasma membrane repair after injury by pore-forming agents.

Abstract: Summary
Cells have developed protein quality-control strategies to manage the accumulation of misfolded substrates during heat stress. Using a soluble reporter of misfolding in fission yeast, Rho1.C17R-GFP, we demonstrate that upon mild heat shock, the reporter collapses in protein aggregate centers (PACs). They contain and/or require several chaperones, such as Hsp104, Hsp16, and the Hsp40/70 couple Mas5/Ssa2. Stress granules do not assemble at mild temperatures and, therefore, are not required for PAC formation; on the contrary, PACs may serve as nucleation centers for the assembly of stress granules. In contrast to the general belief, the dominant fate of these PACs is not degradation, and the aggregated reporter can be disassembled by chaperones and recovers native structure and activity. Using mass spectrometry, we show that thermo-unstable endogenous proteins form PACs as well. In conclusion, formation of PACs during heat shock is a chaperone-mediated adaptation strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogen-mediated damage to the intestinal epithelium activates compensatory growth and differentiation repair programs in progenitor cells. Accelerated progenitor growth replenishes damaged tissue and maintains barrier integrity. Despite the importance of epithelial renewal to intestinal homeostasis, we know little about the effects of pathogen-commensal interactions on progenitor growth. We find that the enteric pathogen Vibrio cholerae blocks critical growth and differentiation pathways in Drosophila progenitors, despite extensive damage to epithelial tissue. We show that the inhibition of epithelial repair requires interactions between the Vibrio cholerae type six secretion system and a community of common symbiotic bacteria, as elimination of the gut microbiome is sufficient to restore homeostatic growth in infected intestines. This work highlights the importance of pathogen-symbiont interactions for intestinal immune responses and outlines the impact of the type six secretion system on pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cell polarity is a key feature in the development of multicellular organisms. For instance, asymmetrically localized plasma-membrane-integral PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins direct transcellular fluxes of the phytohormone auxin that govern plant development. Fine-tuned auxin flux is important for root protophloem sieve element differentiation and requires the interacting plasma-membrane-associated BREVIS RADIX (BRX) and PROTEIN KINASE ASSOCIATED WITH BRX (PAX) proteins. We observed “donut-like” polar PIN localization in developing sieve elements that depends on complementary, “muffin-like” polar localization of BRX and PAX. Plasma membrane association and polarity of PAX, and indirectly BRX, largely depends on phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. Consistently, mutants in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks) display protophloem differentiation defects similar to brx mutants. The same PIP5Ks are in complex with BRX and display “muffin-like” polar localization. Our data suggest that the BRX-PAX module recruits PIP5Ks to reinforce PAX polarity and thereby the polarity of all three proteins, which is required to maintain a local PIN minimum.

Abstract: Summary
During development, intestinal epithelia undergo dramatic morphogenesis mediated by mesenchymal signaling to form villi, which are required for efficient nutrient absorption and host defense. Although both smooth-muscle-induced physical forces and mesenchymal cell clustering beneath emerging villi are implicated in epithelial folding, the underlying cellular mechanisms are unclear. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling can mediate both processes. We therefore analyzed its direct targetome and revealed GLI2 transcriptional activation of atypical cadherin and planar cell polarity (PCP) genes. By examining Fat4 and Dchs1 knockout mice, we demonstrate their critical roles in villus formation. Analyses of PCP-mutant mice and genetic interaction studies show that the Fat4-Dchs1 axis acts in parallel to the core-Vangl2 PCP axis to control mesenchymal cell clustering. Moreover, live light-sheet fluorescence microscopy and cultured PDGFRα+ cells reveal a requirement for PCP in their oriented cell migration guided by WNT5A. Therefore, mesenchymal PCP induced by Hh signaling drives cell clustering and subsequent epithelial remodeling.

Abstract: The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger plays a relevant role in several neurological disorders, thus the pharmacological modulation of its isoforms might represent a promising strategy to ameliorate the course of some neurological pathologies including stroke, neonatal hypoxia, multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer Disease (AD), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This review will summarize heterocyclic, peptidergic, genetic and epigenetic compounds activating or inhibiting the expression/activity of each NCX isoform. In addition, we will focus our attention on the development of new strategies aimed to ameliorate the pathophysiological conditions in which NCX isoform changes are found.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of XIST to dosage compensate a trisomic autosome presents unique experimental opportunities and potentially transformative therapeutic prospects. However, it is currently thought that XIST requires the natural context surrounding pluripotency to initiate chromosome silencing. Here, we demonstrate that XIST RNA induced in differentiated neural cells can trigger chromosome-wide silencing of chromosome 21 in Down syndrome patient-derived cells. Use of this tightly controlled system revealed a deficiency in differentiation of trisomic neural stem cells to neurons, correctible by inducing XIST at different stages of neurogenesis. Single-cell transcriptomics and other analyses strongly implicate elevated Notch signaling due to trisomy 21, thereby promoting neural stem cell cycling that delays terminal differentiation. These findings have significance for illuminating the epigenetic plasticity of cells during development, the understanding of how human trisomy 21 effects Down syndrome neurobiology, and the translational potential of XIST, a unique non-coding RNA.

Abstract: Healing of critical sized bone defects represents a challenging issue in clinical and research fields. Current therapeutic techniques, such as bone grafts or bone grafts substitutes, still have limitations and drawbacks. Therefore, stem cell-based therapy provides a prospective approach to enhance bone regeneration. The present study aimed to assess the regenerative capacity of Gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) as well as Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) loaded on NanoBone scaffold, in comparison to the unloaded one, in surgically created bone defects in rabbits' tibiae. To achieve this aim, critical sized bone defects, of 6-mm diameter each, were unilaterally created in tibiae of adult New Zeeland male white rabbits (n = 27). The rabbits were then divided randomly into three groups (9 each) and received the following: Group I: Unloaded NanoBone Scaffold, Group II: GMSCs Loaded on NanoBone Scaffold, and Group III: BMSCs Loaded on NanoBone Scaffold. Three rabbits from each group were then sacrificed at each time point (2, 4 and 6 weeks postoperatively), tibiae were dissected out to evaluate bone healing in the created bony defects; both histologically and histomorphometrically. The findings of this study indicate that both GMSCs and BMSCs exhibited fibroblast morphology and expressed phenotypic MSCs markers. Histologically, local application of GMSCs and BMSCs loaded on NanoBone scaffold showed enhanced the pattern of bone regeneration as compared to the unloaded scaffold. Histomorphometrically, there was astatistically insignificant difference in the new bone area % between the bony defects treated with GMSCs and BMSCs. Thus, GMSCs can be considered as a comparable alternative source to BMSCs in bone regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
E2F transcription factors control the cytokinesis machinery and thereby ploidy in hepatocytes. If or how these proteins limit proliferation of polyploid cells with extra centrosomes remains unknown. Here, we show that the PIDDosome, a signaling platform essential for caspase-2-activation, limits hepatocyte ploidy and is instructed by the E2F network to control p53 in the developing as well as regenerating liver. Casp2 and Pidd1 act as direct transcriptional targets of E2F1 and its antagonists, E2F7 and E2F8, that together co-regulate PIDDosome expression during juvenile liver growth and regeneration. Of note, whereas hepatocyte aneuploidy correlates with the basal ploidy state, the degree of aneuploidy itself is not limited by PIDDosome-dependent p53 activation. Finally, we provide evidence that the same signaling network is engaged to control ploidy in the human liver after resection. Our study defines the PIDDosome as a primary target to manipulate hepatocyte ploidy and proliferation rates in the regenerating liver.

Mitochondrial Ca2+ Uptake Relieves Palmitate-Induced Cytosolic Ca2+ Overload in MIN6 Cells,

Abstract: Saturated fatty acids contribute to β-cell dysfunction in the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cellular responses to lipotoxicity include oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and blockage of autophagy. Palmitate induces ER Ca2+ depletion followed by notable store-operated Ca2+ entry. Subsequent elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ can activate undesirable signaling pathways culminating in cell death. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) is the major route for Ca2+ uptake into the matrix and couples metabolism with insulin secretion. However, it has been unclear whether mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays a protective role or contributes to lipotoxicity. Here, we observed palmitate upregulated MCU protein expression in a mouse clonal β-cell, MIN6, under normal glucose, but not high glucose medium. Palmitate elevated baseline cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and reduced depolarization-triggered Ca2+ influx likely due to the inactivation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). Targeted reduction of MCU expression using RNA interference abolished mitochondrial superoxide production but exacerbated palmitate-induced [Ca2+]i overload. Consequently, MCU knockdown aggravated blockage of autophagic degradation. In contrast, co-treatment with verapamil, a VGCC inhibitor, prevented palmitate-induced basal [Ca2+]i elevation and defective [Ca2+]i transients. Extracellular Ca2+ chelation as well as VGCC inhibitors effectively rescued autophagy defects and cytotoxicity. These observations suggest enhanced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake via MCU upregulation is a mechanism by which pancreatic β-cells are able to alleviate cytosolic Ca2+ overload and its detrimental consequences.

Abstract: Summary
Naturally occurring or drug-induced DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) interfere with key DNA transactions if not repaired in a timely manner. The unique family of DPC-specific proteases Wss1/SPRTN targets DPC protein moieties for degradation, including stabilized topoisomerase-1 cleavage complexes (Top1ccs). Here, we describe that the efficient DPC disassembly requires Ddi1, another conserved predicted protease in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found Ddi1 in a genetic screen of the tdp1 wss1 mutant defective in Top1cc processing. Ddi1 is recruited to a persistent Top1cc-like DPC lesion in an S phase-dependent manner to assist in the eviction of crosslinked protein from DNA. Loss of Ddi1 or its putative protease activity hypersensitizes cells to DPC trapping agents independently from Wss1 and 26S proteasome, implying its broader role in DPC repair. Among the potential Ddi1 targets, we found the core component of Pol II and show that its genotoxin-induced degradation is impaired in ddi1. We propose that the Ddi1 protease contributes to DPC proteolysis.

Abstract: Summary
Increased glycolytic metabolism recently emerged as an essential process driving host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), but little is known about how this process is regulated during infection. Here, we observe repression of host glycolysis in Mtb-infected macrophages, which is dependent on sustained upregulation of anti-inflammatory microRNA-21 (miR-21) by proliferating mycobacteria. The dampening of glycolysis by miR-21 is mediated through targeting of phosphofructokinase muscle (PFK-M) isoform at the committed step of glycolysis, which facilitates bacterial growth by limiting pro-inflammatory mediators, chiefly interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Unlike other glycolytic genes, PFK-M expression and activity is repressed during Mtb infection through miR-21-mediated regulation, while other less-active isoenzymes dominate. Notably, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which drives Mtb host defense, inhibits miR-21 expression, forcing an isoenzyme switch in the PFK complex, augmenting PFK-M expression and macrophage glycolysis. These findings place the targeting of PFK-M by miR-21 as a key node controlling macrophage immunometabolic function.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), or A20, is a ubiquitin-modifying protein and negative regulator of canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in TNFAIP3 are associated with autoimmune diseases, suggesting a role in tissue inflammation. While the role of A20 in peripheral immune cells has been well investigated, less is known about its role in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that microglial A20 is crucial for maintaining brain homeostasis. Without microglial A20, CD8+ T cells spontaneously infiltrate the CNS and acquire a viral response signature. The combination of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and activated A20-deficient microglia leads to an increase in VGLUT1+ terminals and frequency of spontaneous excitatory currents. Ultimately, A20-deficient microglia upregulate genes associated with the antiviral response and neurodegenerative diseases. Together, our data suggest that microglial A20 acts as a sensor for viral infection and a master regulator of CNS homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphoinositides, diacylglycerolpyrophosphate, ceramide-1-phosphate, and phosphatidic acid belong to a unique class of membrane signaling lipids that contain phosphomonoesters in their headgroups having pKa values in the physiological range. The phosphomonoester headgroup of phosphatidic acid enables this lipid to act as a pH biosensor as changes in its protonation state with intracellular pH regulate binding to effector proteins. Here, we demonstrate that binding of pleckstrin homology (PH) domains to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) in the yeast trans-Golgi network (TGN) is dependent on intracellular pH, indicating PI4P is a pH biosensor. pH biosensing by TGN PI4P in response to nutrient availability governs protein sorting at the TGN, likely by regulating sterol transfer to the TGN by Osh1, a member of the conserved oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family of lipid transfer proteins. Thus, pH biosensing by TGN PI4P allows for direct metabolic regulation of protein trafficking and cell growth.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferons (IFNs) play critical roles in anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity. However, they also suppress protective immune responses in some infectious diseases. Here, we identify type I IFNs as major upstream regulators of CD4+ T cells from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients. Furthermore, we report that mice deficient in type I IFN signaling have significantly improved control of Leishmania donovani, a causative agent of human VL, associated with enhanced IFNγ but reduced IL-10 production by parasite-specific CD4+ T cells. Importantly, we identify a small-molecule inhibitor that can be used to block type I IFN signaling during established infection and acts synergistically with conventional anti-parasitic drugs to improve parasite clearance and enhance anti-parasitic CD4+ T cell responses in mice and humans. Thus, manipulation of type I IFN signaling is a promising strategy for improving disease outcome in VL patients.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell costimulation mediated by CD28 and 4-1BB is essential for CAR-T cell-induced tumor regression. However, CD28 and 4-1BB differentially modulate kinetics, metabolism and persistence of CAR-T cells, and the mechanisms governing these differences are not fully understood. We found that LCK recruited into the synapse of CD28-encoding CAR by co-receptors causes antigen-independent CAR-CD3ζ phosphorylation and increased antigen-dependent T cell activation. In contrast, the synapse formed by 4-1BB-encoding CAR recruits the THEMIS-SHP1 phosphatase complex that attenuates CAR-CD3ζ phosphorylation. We further demonstrated that the CAR synapse can be engineered to recruit either LCK to enhance the kinetics of tumor killing of 4-1BB CAR-T cells or SHP1 to tune down cytokine release of CD28 CAR-T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Current models of apoptosis regulation by the Bcl-2 family of proteins postulate that heterodimeric interactions between family members determine whether Bax and Bak are activated to trigger cell death. Thus, the relative abundance and binding affinities between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins determines the outcome of these interactions. Examination of these interactions using purified mitochondria and liposomes with full-length recombinant proteins revealed that Bcl-xL inhibits apoptosis as a higher-order complex that binds multiple BH3 proteins. Allosteric regulation of this complex by the BH3 sensitizer Bad confers switch-like activity to the indirect activation of Bax. The BH3 activator cBid sequestered by Bcl-xL complexes changes from an inactive to an active form while bound to a Bcl-xL complex only when Bad is also bound. Bcl-xL complexes enable Bad to function as a non-competitive inhibitor of Bcl-xL and allosterically activate cBid, dramatically enhancing the pro-apoptotic potency of Bad.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotes, three-dimensional genome organization is critical for transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can modulate chromatin conformation of spatially related genomic locations within the nucleus. Here, we show that the lncRNA APOLO (AUXIN-REGULATED PROMOTER LOOP) recognizes multiple distant independent loci in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. We found that APOLO targets are not spatially associated in the nucleus and that APOLO recognizes its targets by short sequence complementarity and the formation of DNA-RNA duplexes (R-loops). The invasion of APOLO to the target DNA decoys the plant Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 component LHP1, modulating local chromatin 3D conformation. APOLO lncRNA coordinates the expression of distal unrelated auxin-responsive genes during lateral root development in Arabidopsis. Hence, R-loop formation and chromatin protein decoy mediate trans action of lncRNAs on distant loci.

Abstract: Summary
Compensatory endocytosis of released synaptic vesicles (SVs) relies on coordinated signaling at the lipid-protein interface. Here, we address the synaptic function of C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1), a ubiquitous regulator of gene expression and membrane trafficking in cultured hippocampal neurons. In the absence of CtBP1, synapses form in greater density and show changes in SV distribution and size. The increased basal neurotransmission and enhanced synaptic depression could be attributed to a higher vesicular release probability and a smaller fraction of release-competent SVs, respectively. Rescue experiments with specifically targeted constructs indicate that, while synaptogenesis and release probability are controlled by nuclear CtBP1, the efficient recycling of SVs relies on its synaptic expression. The ability of presynaptic CtBP1 to facilitate compensatory endocytosis depends on its membrane-fission activity and the activation of the lipid-metabolizing enzyme PLD1. Thus, CtBP1 regulates SV recycling by promoting a permissive lipid environment for compensatory endocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Slowing down translation in either the cytosol or the mitochondria is a conserved longevity mechanism. Here, we found a non-interventional natural correlation of mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomal proteins (RPs) in mouse population genetics, suggesting a translational balance. Inhibiting mitochondrial translation in C. elegans through mrps-5 RNAi repressed cytosolic translation. Transcriptomics integrated with proteomics revealed that this inhibition specifically reduced translational efficiency of mRNAs required in growth pathways while increasing stress response mRNAs. The repression of cytosolic translation and extension of lifespan from mrps-5 RNAi were dependent on atf-5/ATF4 and independent from metabolic phenotypes. We found the translational balance to be conserved in mammalian cells upon inhibiting mitochondrial translation pharmacologically with doxycycline. Lastly, extending this in vivo, doxycycline repressed cytosolic translation in the livers of germ-free mice. These data demonstrate that inhibiting mitochondrial translation initiates an atf-5/ATF4-dependent cascade leading to coordinated repression of cytosolic translation, which could be targeted to promote longevity.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies secreted within the intestinal tract provide protection from the invasion of microbes into the host tissues. Germinal center (GC) formation in lymph nodes and spleen strictly requires SLAM-associated protein (SAP)-mediated T cell functions; however, it is not known whether this mechanism plays a similar role in mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues. Here, we find that in Peyer’s patches (PPs), SAP-mediated T cell help is required for promoting B cell selection in GCs, but not for clonal diversification. PPs of SAP-deficient mice host chronic GCs that are absent in T cell-deficient mice. GC B cells in SAP-deficient mice express AID and Bcl6 and generate plasma cells in proportion to the GC size. Single-cell IgA sequencing analysis reveals that these mice host few diversified clones that were subjected to mild selection forces. These findings demonstrate that T cell-derived help to B cells in PPs includes SAP-dependent and SAP-independent functions.

Abstract: Chitin is an important fungal cell wall component that is cross-linked to β-glucan for structural integrity. Acquisition of chitin to glucan cross-links has previously been shown to be performed by transglycosylation enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, called Congo Red hypersensitive (Crh) enzymes. Here, we characterized the impact of deleting all seven members of the crh gene family (crhA-G) in Aspergillus niger on cell wall integrity, cell wall composition and genome-wide gene expression. In this study, we show that the seven-fold crh knockout strain shows slightly compact growth on plates, but no increased sensitivity to cell wall perturbing compounds. Additionally, we found that the cell wall composition of this knockout strain was virtually identical to that of the wild type. In congruence with these data, genome-wide expression analysis revealed very limited changes in gene expression and no signs of activation of the cell wall integrity response pathway. However, deleting the entire crh gene family in cell wall mutants that are deficient in either galactofuranose or α-glucan, mainly α-1,3-glucan, resulted in a synthetic growth defect and an increased sensitivity towards Congo Red compared to the parental strains, respectively. Altogether, these results indicate that loss of the crh gene family in A. niger does not trigger the cell wall integrity response, but does play an important role in ensuring cell wall integrity in mutant strains with reduced galactofuranose or α-glucan.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleotide deprivation and imbalance present detrimental conditions for animals and are thus expected to trigger cellular responses that direct protective changes in metabolic, developmental, and behavioral programs, albeit such mechanisms are vastly underexplored. Following our previous finding that Caenorhabditis elegans shut down germ cell proliferation in response to pyrimidine deprivation, we find in this study that endonuclease ENDU-2 regulates nucleotide metabolism and germ cell proliferation in response to nucleotide imbalance and other genotoxic stress, and that it affects mitotic chromosomal segregation in the intestine and lifespan. ENDU-2 expression is induced by nucleotide imbalance and genotoxic stress, and ENDU-2 exerts its function in the intestine, mostly by inhibiting the phosphorylation of CTPS-1 through repressing the PKA pathway and histone deacetylase HDA-1. Human EndoU also affects the response to genotoxic drugs. Our work reveals an unknown role of ENDU-2 in regulating nucleotide metabolism and animals’ response to genotoxic stress, which may link EndoU function to cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Clearance of biomolecular condensates by selective autophagy is thought to play a crucial role in cellular homeostasis. However, the mechanism underlying selective autophagy of condensates and whether liquidity determines a condensate’s susceptibility to degradation by autophagy remain unknown. Here, we show that the selective autophagic cargo aminopeptidase I (Ape1) undergoes phase separation to form semi-liquid droplets. The Ape1-specific receptor protein Atg19 localizes to the surface of Ape1 droplets both in vitro and in vivo, with the “floatability” of Atg19 preventing its penetration into droplets. In vitro reconstitution experiments reveal that Atg19 and lipidated Atg8 are necessary and sufficient for selective sequestration of Ape1 droplets by membranes. This sequestration is impaired by mutational solidification of Ape1 droplets or diminished ability of Atg19 to float. Taken together, we propose that cargo liquidity and the presence of sufficient amounts of autophagic receptor on cargo are crucial for selective autophagy of biomolecular condensates.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) form complexes with various partner proteins to recognize their genomic target sites. Yet, how the DNA sequence determines which TF complex forms at any given site is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that high-throughput in vitro DNA binding assays coupled with unbiased computational analysis provide unprecedented insight into how different DNA sequences select distinct compositions and configurations of homeodomain TF complexes. Using inferred knowledge about minor groove width readout, we design targeted protein mutations that destabilize homeodomain binding both in vitro and in vivo in a complex-specific manner. By performing parallel systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment sequencing (SELEX-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and Hi-C assays, we not only classify the majority of in vivo binding events in terms of complex composition but also infer complex-specific functions by perturbing the gene regulatory network controlled by a single complex.

Abstract: Objectives
We aim to develop a 3D-bilayer collagen (COL) membrane reinforced with nano beta-tricalcium-phosphate (nβ-TCP) particles and to evaluate its bone regeneration in combination with leukocyte-platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) in vivo.
Background data
L-PRF has exhibited promising results as a cell carrier in bone regeneration in a number of clinical studies, however there are some studies that did not confirm the positive results of L-PRF application.
Methods
Mechanical & physiochemical characteristics of the COL/nβ-TCP membrane (1/2 & 1/4) were tested. Proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of seeded cells on bilayer collagen/nβ-TCP thick membrane was examined. Then, critical-sized calvarial defects in 8 white New Zealand rabbits were filled with either Col, Col/nβ-TCP, Col/nβ-TCP combined with L-PRF membrane, or left empty. New bone formation (NBF) was measured histomorphometrically 4 & 8 weeks postoperatively.
Results
Compressive modulus increases while porosity decreases with higher β-TCP concentrations. Mechanical properties improve, with 89 % porosity (pore size ∼100 μm) in the bilayer-collagen/nβ-TCP membrane. The bilayer design also enhances the proliferation and ALP activity. In vivo study shows no significant difference among test groups at 4 weeks, but Col/nβ-TCP + L-PRF demonstrates more NBF compared to others (P < 0.05) after 8 weeks.
Conclusion
The bilayer-collagen/nβ-TCP thick membrane shows promising physiochemical in vitro results and significant NBF, as ¾ of the defect is filled with lamellar bone when combined with L-PRF membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Working memory-guided behaviors require memory retention during delay periods, when subsets of prefrontal neurons have been reported to exhibit persistently elevated firing. What happens to delay activity when information stored in working memory is no longer relevant for guiding behavior? In this study, we perform juxtacellular recording and labeling of delay-tuned (-elevated or -suppressed) neurons in the prelimbic cortex of freely moving rats, performing a familiar delayed cue-matching-to-place task. Unexpectedly, novel task-rules are introduced, rendering information held in working memory irrelevant. Following successful strategy switching within one session, delay-tuned neurons are filled with neurobiotin for histological analysis. Delay-elevated neurons include pyramidal cells with large heterogeneity of soma-dendritic distribution, molecular expression profiles, and task-relevant activity. Rule change induces heterogenous adjustments on individual neurons and ensembles’ activity but cumulates in balanced firing rate reorganizations across cortical layers. Our results demonstrate divergent cellular and network dynamics when an abrupt change in task rules interferes with working memory.

Abstract: Summary
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) is considered a global regulator of cellular metabolism and innate immune cell functions. Intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania have been reported to manipulate host cell metabolism. Herein, we demonstrate that myeloid cells from myeloid-restricted HIF-1α-deficient mice and individuals with loss-of-function HIF1A gene polymorphisms are more susceptible to L. donovani infection through increased lipogenesis. Absence of HIF-1α leads to a defect in BNIP3 expression, resulting in the activation of mTOR and nuclear translocation of SREBP-1c. We observed the induction of lipogenic gene transcripts, such as FASN, and lipid accumulation in infected HIF-1α−/− macrophages. L. donovani-infected HIF-1α-deficient mice develop hypertriglyceridemia and lipid accumulation in splenic and hepatic myeloid cells. Most importantly, our data demonstrate that manipulating FASN or SREBP-1c using pharmacological inhibitors significantly reduced parasite burden. As such, genetic deficiency of HIF-1α is associated with increased lipid accumulation, which results in impaired host-protective anti-leishmanial functions of myeloid cells.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells integrate diverse environmental signals to modulate their function for optimal suppression. Translational regulation represents a favorable mechanism for Treg cell environmental sensing and adaptation. In this study, we carry out an unbiased screen of the Treg cell translatome and identify serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1), a known salt sensor in T cells, as being preferentially translated in activated Treg cells. We show that high salt (HS) drives thymic Treg cells to adopt a T helper type 17 (Th17)-like phenotype and enhances generation of Th17-like induced Treg cells in a SGK1-dependent manner, all the while maintaining suppressive function. Salt-mediated Th17-like differentiation of Treg cells was evident in mice fed with HS diet or injected with HS-preconditioned T cells. Overall, SGK1 enables Treg cells to adapt their function in response to environmental cues. By understanding these environmental-sensing mechanisms, we envision targeted approaches to fine-tune Treg cell function for better control of inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Immunotherapy has emerged as a powerful new chapter in the fight against cancer. However, it has yet to reach its full potential due in part to the complexity of the cancer immune response. We demonstrate that tumor-targeting EDV nanocells function as an immunotherapeutic by delivering a cytotoxin in conjunction with activation of the immune system. These nanocells polarize M1 macrophages and activate NK cells concurrently producing a Th1 cytokine response resulting in potent antitumor function. Dendritic cell maturation and antigen presentation follows, which generates tumor-specific CD8+ T cells, conferring prolonged tumor remission. The combination of cytotoxin delivery and activation of innate and adaptive antitumor immune responses results in a potent cyto-immunotherapeutic with potential in clinical oncology.

Abstract: Summary
The inability of Nef to downmodulate the CD3-T cell receptor (TCR) complex distinguishes HIV-1 from other primate lentiviruses and may contribute to its high virulence. However, the role of this Nef function in virus-mediated immune activation and pathogenicity remains speculative. Here, we selectively disrupted this Nef activity in SIVmac239 and analyzed the consequences for the virological, immunological, and clinical outcome of infection in rhesus macaques. The inability to downmodulate CD3-TCR does not impair viral replication during acute infection but is associated with increased immune activation and antiviral gene expression. Subsequent early reversion in three of six animals suggests strong selective pressure for this Nef function and is associated with high viral loads and progression to simian AIDS. In the absence of reversions, however, viral replication and the clinical course of infection are attenuated. Thus, Nef-mediated downmodulation of CD3 dampens the inflammatory response to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and seems critical for efficient viral immune evasion.

Abstract: The ischemic tolerance (IT) paradigm represents a fundamental cell response to certain types or injury able to render an organ more “tolerant” to a subsequent, stronger, insult. During the 16th century, the toxicologist Paracelsus described for the first time the possibility that a noxious event might determine a state of tolerance. This finding was summarized in one of his most important mentions: “The dose makes the poison”. In more recent years, ischemic tolerance in the brain was first described in 1991, when it was demonstrated by Kirino and collaborators that two minutes of subthreshold brain ischemia in gerbils produced tolerance against global brain ischemia. Based on the time in which the conditioning stimulus is applied, it is possible to define preconditioning, perconditioning and postconditioning, when the subthreshold insult is applied before, during or after the ischemic event, respectively. Furthermore, depending on the temporal delay from the ischemic event, two different modalities are distinguished: rapid or delayed preconditioning and postconditioning. Finally, the circumstance in which the conditioning stimulus is applied on an organ distant from the brain is referred as remote conditioning. Over the years the “conditioning” paradigm has been applied to several brain disorders and a number of molecular mechanisms taking part to these protective processes have been described. The mechanisms are usually classified in three distinct categories identified as triggers, mediators and effectors. As concerns the putative effectors, it has been hypothesized that brain cells appear to have the ability to adapt to hypoxia by reducing their energy demand through modulation of ion channels and transporters, which delays anoxic depolarization. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the role played by plasmamembrane proteins able to control ionic homeostasis in mediating protection elicited by brain conditioning, particular attention will be deserved to the role played by Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.

Abstract: Summary
Deregulation of MYC plays an essential role in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), yet the mechanisms underlying its deregulation remain elusive. Herein, we identify a molecular mechanism responsible for reciprocal activation between Aurora B kinase (AURKB) and MYC. AURKB directly phosphorylates MYC at serine 67, counteracting GSK3β-directed threonine 58 phosphorylation and subsequent FBXW7-mediated proteasomal degradation. Stabilized MYC, in concert with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1 (TAL1), directly activates AURKB transcription, constituting a positive feedforward loop that reinforces MYC-regulated oncogenic programs. Therefore, inhibitors of AURKB induce prominent MYC degradation concomitant with robust leukemia cell death. These findings reveal an AURKB-MYC regulatory circuit that underlies T cell leukemogenesis, and provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of oncogenic MYC via AURKB inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) store lipids for energy and are central to cellular lipid homeostasis. The mechanisms coordinating lipid storage in LDs with cellular metabolism are unclear but relevant to obesity-related diseases. Here we utilized genome-wide screening to identify genes that modulate lipid storage in macrophages, a cell type involved in metabolic diseases. Among ∼550 identified screen hits is MLX, a basic helix-loop-helix leucine-zipper transcription factor that regulates metabolic processes. We show that MLX and glucose-sensing family members MLXIP/MondoA and MLXIPL/ChREBP bind LDs via C-terminal amphipathic helices. When LDs accumulate in cells, these transcription factors bind to LDs, reducing their availability for transcriptional activity and attenuating the response to glucose. Conversely, the absence of LDs results in hyperactivation of MLX target genes. Our findings uncover a paradigm for a lipid storage response in which binding of MLX transcription factors to LD surfaces adjusts the expression of metabolic genes to lipid storage levels.

Abstract: Summary
Defects in the maintenance of intercellular junctions are associated with loss of epithelial barrier function and consequent pathological conditions, including invasive cancers. Epithelial integrity is dependent on actomyosin bundles at adherens junctions, but the origin of these junctional bundles is incompletely understood. Here we show that peripheral actomyosin bundles can be generated from a specific actin stress fiber subtype, transverse arcs, through their lateral fusion at cell-cell contacts. Importantly, we find that assembly and maintenance of peripheral actomyosin bundles are dependent on the mechanosensitive CaMKK2/AMPK signaling pathway and that inhibition of this route leads to disruption of tension-maintaining actomyosin bundles and re-growth of stress fiber precursors. This results in redistribution of cellular forces, defects in monolayer integrity, and loss of epithelial identity. These data provide evidence that the mechanosensitive CaMKK2/AMPK pathway is critical for the maintenance of peripheral actomyosin bundles and thus dictates cell-cell junctions through cellular force distribution.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic modifications on DNA and histones regulate gene expression by modulating chromatin accessibility to transcription machinery. Here we identify methionine as a key nutrient affecting epigenetic reprogramming in CD4+ T helper (Th) cells. Using metabolomics, we showed that methionine is rapidly taken up by activated T cells and serves as the major substrate for biosynthesis of the universal methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Methionine was required to maintain intracellular SAM pools in T cells. Methionine restriction reduced histone H3K4 methylation (H3K4me3) at the promoter regions of key genes involved in Th17 cell proliferation and cytokine production. Applied to the mouse model of multiple sclerosis (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), dietary methionine restriction reduced the expansion of pathogenic Th17 cells in vivo, leading to reduced T cell-mediated neuroinflammation and disease onset. Our data identify methionine as a key nutritional factor shaping Th cell proliferation and function in part through regulation of histone methylation.

Abstract: Summary
To divide in a tissue, both normal and cancer cells become spherical and mechanically stiffen as they enter mitosis. We investigated the effect of oncogene activation on this process in normal epithelial cells. We found that short-term induction of oncogenic RasV12 activates downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK-ERK) signaling to alter cell mechanics and enhance mitotic rounding, so that RasV12-expressing cells are softer in interphase but stiffen more upon entry into mitosis. These RasV12-dependent changes allow cells to round up and divide faithfully when confined underneath a stiff hydrogel, conditions in which normal cells and cells with reduced levels of Ras-ERK signaling suffer multiple spindle assembly and chromosome segregation errors. Thus, by promoting cell rounding and stiffening in mitosis, oncogenic RasV12 enables cells to proliferate under conditions of mechanical confinement like those experienced by cells in crowded tumors.

Abstract: K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger proteins (NCKX1-5) of the SLC24 gene family play important roles in a wide range of biological processes including but not limited to rod and cone photoreceptor vision, olfaction, enamel formation and skin pigmentation. NCKX proteins are also widely expressed throughout the brain and NCKX2 and NCKX4 knockouts in mice have specific phenotypes. Here we review our work on structure-function relationships of NCKX proteins. We discuss membrane topology, domains critical to transport function, and residues critical to cation binding and transport function, all in the context of crystal structures that were obtained for the archaeal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCX_Mj.

Abstract: Summary
IQGAP1 is a master regulator of many cellular processes, including intracellular vesicle trafficking and endocytosis. We show that depletion of IQGAP1 in a variety of cell types increases the release of HIV-1 infectious virions and that overexpression diminishes virion production, with neither affecting the early stages of infection. IQGAP1 negatively regulates the steady-state levels of HIV-1 Gag at the plasma membrane, the site of assembly. We establish that IQGAP1 interacts with both the nucleocapsid and p6 domains of Gag, and interaction with either domain is sufficient for its regulatory function. Finally, we demonstrate that IQGAP1 regulation is independent of HIV-1 Gag “late-domains” sequences required by the virus to recruit the cellular ESCRT machinery. Thus, we provide evidence that IQGAP1 is a negative regulatory factor inhibiting efficient budding of HIV-1 by reducing Gag accumulation at the plasma membrane.

Abstract: Summary
The lung microvasculature is essential for gas exchange and commonly considered homogeneous. We show that VEGFA from the epithelium is required for a distinct endothelial cell (EC) population in the mouse lung. Vegfa is predominantly expressed by alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells and locally required to specify a subset of ECs. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals that ∼15% of lung ECs are transcriptionally distinct—marked by Carbonic anhydrase 4 (Car4)—and arise from bulk ECs, as suggested by trajectory analysis. Car4 ECs have extensive cellular projections and are separated from AT1 cells by a limited basement membrane without intervening pericytes. Car4 ECs are specifically lost upon epithelial Vegfa deletion; without Car4 ECs, the alveolar space is aberrantly enlarged despite the normal appearance of myofibroblasts. Lung Car4 ECs and retina tip ECs have common and distinct features. These findings support a signaling role of AT1 cells and shed light on alveologenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a signaling lipid involved in the modulation of synaptic structure and functioning. Based on previous work showing a decreasing PA gradient along the longitudinal axis of the rodent hippocampus, we asked whether the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and the ventral hippocampus (VH) are differentially affected by PA modulation. Here, we show that phospholipase D1 (PLD1) is a major hippocampal PA source, compared to PLD2, and that PLD1 ablation affects predominantly the lipidome of the DH. Moreover, Pld1 knockout (KO) mice show specific deficits in novel object recognition and social interaction and disruption in the DH-VH dendritic arborization differentiation in CA1/CA3 pyramidal neurons. Also, Pld1 KO animals present reduced long-term depression (LTD) induction and reduced GluN2A and SNAP-25 protein levels in the DH. Overall, we observe that PLD1-derived PA reduction leads to differential lipid signatures along the longitudinal hippocampal axis, predominantly affecting DH organization and functioning.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) places H3K27me3 at developmental genes and is causally implicated in keeping bivalent genes silent. It is unclear if that silence requires minimum H3K27me3 levels and how the mark transmits faithfully across mammalian somatic cell generations. Mouse intestinal cells lacking EZH2 methyltransferase reduce H3K27me3 proportionately at all PRC2 target sites, but ∼40% uniform residual levels keep target genes inactive. These genes, derepressed in PRC2-null villus cells, remain silent in intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and computational modeling indicate that because unmodified histones dilute H3K27me3 by 50% each time DNA replicates, PRC2-deficient ISCs initially retain sufficient H3K27me3 to avoid gene derepression. EZH2 mutant human lymphoma cells also require multiple divisions before H3K27me3 dilution relieves gene silencing. In both cell types, promoters with high basal H3K4me2/3 activate in spite of some residual H3K27me3, compared to less-poised promoters. These findings have implications for PRC2 inhibition in cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Biogenesis of the human telomerase RNA (hTR) involves a complex series of posttranscriptional modifications, including hypermethylation of the 5′ mono-methylguanosine cap to a tri-methylguanosine cap (TMG). How the TMG cap affects hTR maturation is unknown. Here, we show that depletion of trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1), the enzyme responsible for cap hypermethylation, increases levels of hTR and telomerase. Diminished trimethylation increases hTR association with the cap-binding complex (CBC) and with Sm chaperone proteins. Loss of TGS1 causes an increase in accumulation of mature hTR in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm compared with controls. In TGS1 mutant cells, increased hTR assembles with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein to yield elevated active telomerase complexes and increased telomerase activity, resulting in telomere elongation in cultured human cells. Our results show that TGS1-mediated hypermethylation of the hTR cap inhibits hTR accumulation, restrains levels of assembled telomerase, and limits telomere elongation.

Abstract: Summary
We developed neratinib-resistant HER2-mutant cancer cells by gradual dose escalation. RNA sequencing identified TORC1 signaling as an actionable mechanism of drug resistance. Primary and acquired neratinib resistance in HER2-mutant breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) was also associated with TORC1 hyperactivity. Genetic suppression of RAPTOR or RHEB ablated P-S6 and restored sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The combination of the TORC1 inhibitor everolimus and neratinib potently arrested the growth of neratinib-resistant xenografts and organoids established from neratinib-resistant PDXs. RNA and whole-exome sequencing revealed RAS-mediated TORC1 activation in a subset of neratinib-resistant models. DNA sequencing of HER2-mutant tumors clinically refractory to neratinib, as well as circulating tumor DNA profiling of patients who progressed on neratinib, showed enrichment of genomic alterations that converge to activate the mTOR pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease is the world’s most common neurodegenerative disorder. It is associated with neuroinflammation involving activation of microglia by β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits. Based on previous studies showing apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) binding and cross-seeding extracellular Aβ, we investigate the propagation of ASC between primary microglia and the effects of ASC-Aβ composites on microglial inflammasomes and function. Indeed, ASC released by a pyroptotic cell can be functionally built into the neighboring microglia NOD-like receptor protein (NLRP3) inflammasome. Compared with protein-only application, exposure to ASC-Aβ composites amplifies the proinflammatory response, resulting in pyroptotic cell death, setting free functional ASC and inducing a feedforward stimulating vicious cycle. Clustering around ASC fibrils also compromises clearance of Aβ by microglia. Together, these data enable a closer look at the turning point from acute to chronic Aβ-related neuroinflammation through formation of ASC-Aβ composites.

Abstract: Summary
Most metazoan cells entering mitosis undergo characteristic rounding, which is important for accurate spindle positioning and chromosome separation. Rounding is driven by contractile tension generated by myosin motors in the sub-membranous actin cortex. Recent studies highlight that alongside myosin activity, cortical actin organization is a key regulator of cortex tension. Yet, how mitotic actin organization is controlled remains poorly understood. To address this, we characterized the F-actin interactome in spread interphase and round mitotic cells. Using super-resolution microscopy, we then screened for regulators of cortex architecture and identified the intermediate filament vimentin and the actin-vimentin linker plectin as unexpected candidates. We found that vimentin is recruited to the mitotic cortex in a plectin-dependent manner. We then showed that cortical vimentin controls actin network organization and mechanics in mitosis and is required for successful cell division in confinement. Together, our study highlights crucial interactions between cytoskeletal networks during cell division.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal degeneration is a form of neurodegenerative disease and is the leading cause of vision loss globally. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are primary components of the innate immune system involved in signal transduction. Here we show that TLR2 induces complement factors C3 and CFB, the common and rate-limiting factors of the alternative pathway in both retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and mononuclear phagocytes. Neutralization of TLR2 reduces opsonizing fragments of C3 in the outer retina and protects photoreceptor neurons from oxidative stress-induced degeneration. TLR2 deficiency also preserves tight junction expression and promotes RPE resistance to fragmentation. Finally, oxidative stress-induced formation of the terminal complement membrane attack complex and Iba1+ cell infiltration are strikingly inhibited in the TLR2-deficient retina. Our data directly implicate TLR2 as a mediator of retinal degeneration in response to oxidative stress and present TLR2 as a bridge between oxidative damage and complement-mediated retinal pathology.
