Abstract: Summary
The ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway degrades nascent chains (NCs) arising from interrupted translation. First, recycling factors split stalled ribosomes, yielding NC-tRNA/60S ribosome-nascent chain complexes (60S RNCs). 60S RNCs associate with NEMF, which recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin that ubiquitinates NCs. The mechanism of subsequent ribosomal release of Ub-NCs remains obscure. We found that, in non-ubiquitinated 60S RNCs and 80S RNCs formed on non-stop mRNAs, tRNA is not firmly fixed in the P site, which allows peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase Ptrh1 to cleave NC-tRNA, suggesting the existence of a pathway involving release of non-ubiquitinated NCs. Association with NEMF and Listerin and ubiquitination of NCs results in accommodation of NC-tRNA, rendering 60S RNCs resistant to Ptrh1 but susceptible to ANKZF1, which induces specific cleavage in the tRNA acceptor arm, releasing proteasome-degradable Ub-NCs linked to four 3′-terminal tRNA nucleotides. We also found that TCF25, a poorly characterized RQC component, ensures preferential formation of the K48-ubiquitin linkage.

Abstract: Summary
In the primate visual system, direction-selective (DS) neurons are critical for visual motion perception. While DS neurons in the dorsal visual pathway have been well characterized, the response properties of DS neurons in other major visual areas are largely unexplored. Recent optical imaging studies in monkey visual cortex area 2 (V2) revealed clusters of DS neurons. This imaging method facilitates targeted recordings from these neurons. Using optical imaging and single-cell recording, we characterized detailed response properties of DS neurons in macaque V2. Compared with DS neurons in the dorsal areas (e.g., middle temporal area [MT]), V2 DS neurons have a smaller receptive field and a stronger antagonistic surround. They do not code speed or plaid motion but are sensitive to motion contrast. Our results suggest that V2 DS neurons play an important role in figure-ground segregation. The clusters of V2 DS neurons are likely specialized functional systems for detecting motion contrast.

Abstract: Summary
In vivo, replication forks proceed beyond replication-blocking lesions by way of downstream repriming, generating daughter strand gaps that are subsequently processed by post-replicative repair pathways such as homologous recombination and translesion synthesis (TLS). The way these gaps are filled during TLS is presently unknown. The structure of gap repair synthesis was assessed by sequencing large collections of single DNA molecules that underwent specific TLS events in vivo. The higher error frequency of specialized relative to replicative polymerases allowed us to visualize gap-filling events at high resolution. Unexpectedly, the data reveal that a specialized polymerase, Pol V, synthesizes stretches of DNA both upstream and downstream of a site-specific DNA lesion. Pol V-mediated untargeted mutations are thus spread over several hundred nucleotides, strongly eliciting genetic instability on either side of a given lesion. Consequently, post-replicative gap repair may be a source of untargeted mutations critical for gene diversification in adaptation and evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Synthetically engineered DNA-encoded monoclonal antibodies (DMAbs) are an in vivo platform for evaluation and delivery of human mAb to control against infectious disease. Here, we engineer DMAbs encoding potent anti-Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) mAbs isolated from Ebola virus disease survivors. We demonstrate the development of a human IgG1 DMAb platform for in vivo EBOV-GP mAb delivery and evaluation in a mouse model. Using this approach, we show that DMAb-11 and DMAb-34 exhibit functional and molecular profiles comparable to recombinant mAb, have a wide window of expression, and provide rapid protection against lethal mouse-adapted EBOV challenge. The DMAb platform represents a simple, rapid, and reproducible approach for evaluating the activity of mAb during clinical development. DMAbs have the potential to be a mAb delivery system, which may be advantageous for protection against highly pathogenic infectious diseases, like EBOV, in resource-limited and other challenging settings.

Abstract: Summary
How fully differentiated cells that experience carcinogenic insults become proliferative cancer progenitors that acquire multiple initiating mutations is not clear. This question is of particular relevance to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which arises from differentiated hepatocytes. Here we show that one solution to this problem is provided by CD44, a hyaluronic acid receptor whose expression is rapidly induced in carcinogen-exposed hepatocytes in a STAT3-dependent manner. Once expressed, CD44 potentiates AKT activation to induce the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Mdm2, which terminates the p53 genomic surveillance response. This allows DNA-damaged hepatocytes to escape p53-induced death and senescence and respond to proliferative signals that promote fixation of mutations and their transmission to daughter cells that go on to become HCC progenitors.

Abstract: Neurodegeneration can result in memory loss in the central nervous system (CNS) and impairment of taste and smell in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The neurodegeneration seen in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by functional loss of dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies have also found a role for dopaminergic neurons in regulating taste memory rewards in insects. To investigate how taste memories and sugar sensitivity can be affected in PD, we utilized the DJ-1β mutant fruit fly, DJ-1βex54, as a PD model. We performed binary choice feeding assays, electrophysiology and taste-mediated memory tests to explore the function of the DJ-1β gene in terms of sugar sensitivity as well as associative taste memory. We found that PD flies exhibited an impaired ability to discriminate sucrose across a range of sugar concentrations, with normal responses at only very high concentrations of sugar. They also showed an impairment in associative taste memory. We highlight that the taste impairment and memory defect in DJ-1βex54 can be recovered by the expression of wild-type DJ-1β gene in the dopaminergic neurons. We also emphasized the role of dopaminergic neurons in restoring taste memory function. This impaired memory property of DJ-1βex54 flies also allows them to be used as a model system for finding supplementary dietary foods that can improve memory function. Here we provide evidence that the associative taste memory of both control and DJ-1βex54 flies can be enhanced with dietary supplementation of the medicinal plant, omija.

Abstract: Summary
Viral DNA sensing is an essential component of the mammalian innate immune response. Upon binding viral DNA, the cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) catalyzes the production of cyclic dinucleotides to induce type I interferons. However, little is known about how cGAS is homeostatically maintained or regulated upon infection. Here, we define cytoplasmic cGAS interactions with cellular and viral proteins upon herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection in primary human fibroblasts. We compare several HSV-1 strains (wild-type, d109, d106) that induce cytokine responses and apoptosis and place cGAS interactions in the context of temporal proteome alterations using isobaric-labeling mass spectrometry. Follow-up analyses establish a functional interaction between cGAS and 2ʹ-5ʹ-oligoadenylate synthase-like protein OASL. The OAS-like domain interacts with the cGAS Mab21 domain, while the OASL ubiquitin-like domain further inhibits cGAS-mediated interferon response. Our findings explain how cGAS may be inactively maintained in cellular homeostasis, with OASL functioning as a negative feedback loop for cytokine induction.

Abstract: Summary
The approximately thirty core subunits of kinetochores assemble on centromeric chromatin containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A and connect chromosomes with spindle microtubules. The chromatin proximal 16-subunit CCAN (constitutive centromere associated network) creates a mechanically stable bridge between CENP-A and the kinetochore’s microtubule-binding machinery, the 10-subunit KMN assembly. Here, we reconstituted a stoichiometric 11-subunit human CCAN core that forms when the CENP-OPQUR complex binds to a joint interface on the CENP-HIKM and CENP-LN complexes. The resulting CCAN particle is globular and connects KMN and CENP-A in a 26-subunit recombinant particle. The disordered, basic N-terminal tail of CENP-Q binds microtubules and promotes accurate chromosome alignment, cooperating with KMN in microtubule binding. The N-terminal basic tail of the NDC80 complex, the microtubule-binding subunit of KMN, can functionally replace the CENP-Q tail. Our work dissects the connectivity and architecture of CCAN and reveals unexpected functional similarities between CENP-OPQUR and the NDC80 complex.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic metabolic diseases have been linked to molecular signatures of mitochondrial dysfunction. Nonetheless, molecular remodeling of the transcriptome, proteome, and/or metabolome does not necessarily translate to functional consequences that confer physiologic phenotypes. The work here aims to bridge the gap between molecular and functional phenomics by developing and validating a multiplexed assay platform for comprehensive assessment of mitochondrial energy transduction. The diagnostic power of the platform stems from a modified version of the creatine kinase energetic clamp technique, performed in parallel with multiplexed analyses of dehydrogenase activities and ATP synthesis rates. Together, these assays provide diagnostic coverage of the mitochondrial network at a level approaching that gained by molecular “-omics” technologies. Application of the platform to a comparison of skeletal muscle versus heart mitochondria reveals mechanistic insights into tissue-specific distinctions in energy transfer efficiency. This platform opens exciting opportunities to unravel the connection between mitochondrial bioenergetics and human disease.

Abstract: Summary
We present a method for automatically discovering signaling pathways from time-resolved phosphoproteomic data. The Temporal Pathway Synthesizer (TPS) algorithm uses constraint-solving techniques first developed in the context of formal verification to explore paths in an interaction network. It systematically eliminates all candidate structures for a signaling pathway where a protein is activated or inactivated before its upstream regulators. The algorithm can model more than one hundred thousand dynamic phosphosites and can discover pathway members that are not differentially phosphorylated. By analyzing temporal data, TPS defines signaling cascades without needing to experimentally perturb individual proteins. It recovers known pathways and proposes pathway connections when applied to the human epidermal growth factor and yeast osmotic stress responses. Independent kinase mutant studies validate predicted substrates in the TPS osmotic stress pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) give rise to the cells that produce red blood cells and platelets. Although the mechanisms underlying megakaryocytic (MK) and erythroid (E) maturation have been described, those controlling their specification from MEPs are unknown. Single-cell RNA sequencing of primary human MEPs, common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), megakaryocyte progenitors, and E progenitors revealed a distinct transitional MEP signature. Inferred regulatory transcription factors (TFs) were associated with differential expression of cell cycle regulators. Genetic manipulation of selected TFs validated their role in lineage specification and demonstrated coincident modulation of the cell cycle. Genetic and pharmacologic modulation demonstrated that cell cycle activation is sufficient to promote E versus MK specification. These findings, obtained from healthy human cells, lay a foundation to study the mechanisms underlying benign and malignant disease states of the megakaryocytic and E lineages.

Abstract: Summary
The actin cytoskeleton is critical to shape cells and pattern intracellular organelles, which collectively drives tissue morphogenesis. In multiciliated cells (MCCs), apical actin drives expansion of the cell surface necessary to host hundreds of cilia. The apical actin also forms a lattice to uniformly distribute basal bodies. This apical actin network is dynamically remodeled, but the molecules that regulate its architecture remain poorly understood. We identify the chromatin modifier, WDR5, as a regulator of apical F-actin in MCCs. Unexpectedly in MCCs, WDR5 has a function independent of chromatin modification. We discover a scaffolding role for WDR5 between the basal body and F-actin. Specifically, WDR5 binds to basal bodies and migrates apically, where F-actin organizes around WDR5. Using a monomer trap for G-actin, we show that WDR5 stabilizes F-actin to maintain lattice architecture. In summary, we identify a non-chromatin role for WDR5 in stabilizing F-actin in MCCs.

Abstract: Summary
Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a potent proinflammatory signature of viral infection. Long cytosolic dsRNA is recognized by MDA5. The cooperative assembly of MDA5 into helical filaments on dsRNA nucleates the assembly of a multiprotein type I interferon signaling platform. Here, we determined cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of MDA5-dsRNA filaments with different helical twists and bound nucleotide analogs at resolutions sufficient to build and refine atomic models. The structures identify the filament-forming interfaces, which encode the dsRNA binding cooperativity and length specificity of MDA5. The predominantly hydrophobic interface contacts confer flexibility, reflected in the variable helical twist within filaments. Mutation of filament-forming residues can result in loss or gain of signaling activity. Each MDA5 molecule spans 14 or 15 RNA base pairs, depending on the twist. Variations in twist also correlate with variations in the occupancy and type of nucleotide in the active site, providing insights on how ATP hydrolysis contributes to MDA5-dsRNA recognition.

Abstract: Summary
Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a frequently incurable disease associated with the human lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). RNAi screening of ATLL lines revealed that their proliferation depends on BATF3 and IRF4, which cooperatively drive ATLL-specific gene expression. HBZ, the only HTLV-I encoded transcription factor that is expressed in all ATLL cases, binds to an ATLL-specific BATF3 super-enhancer and thereby regulates the expression of BATF3 and its downstream targets, including MYC. Inhibitors of bromodomain-and-extra-terminal-domain (BET) chromatin proteins collapsed the transcriptional network directed by HBZ and BATF3, and were consequently toxic for ATLL cell lines, patient samples, and xenografts. Our study demonstrates that the HTLV-I oncogenic retrovirus exploits a regulatory module that can be attacked therapeutically with BET inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine glutarylation (Kglu) of mitochondrial proteins is associated with glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) deficiency, which impairs lysine/tryptophan degradation and causes destruction of striatal neurons during catabolic crisis with subsequent movement disability. By investigating the role of Kglu modifications in this disease, we compared the brain and liver glutarylomes of Gcdh-deficient mice. In the brain, we identified 73 Kglu sites on 37 mitochondrial proteins involved in various metabolic degradation pathways. Ultrastructural immunogold studies indicated that glutarylated proteins are heterogeneously distributed in mitochondria, which are exclusively localized in glial cells. In liver cells, all mitochondria contain Kglu-modified proteins. Glutarylation reduces the catalytic activities of the most abundant glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and the brain-specific carbonic anhydrase 5b and interferes with GDH-protein interactions. We propose that Kglu contributes to the functional heterogeneity of mitochondria and may metabolically adapt glial cells to the activity and metabolic demands of neighboring GCDH-deficient neurons.

Abstract: Summary
In sterile neuroinflammation, a pathological role is proposed for microglia, whereas in viral encephalitis, their function is not entirely clear. Many viruses exploit the odorant system and enter the CNS via the olfactory bulb (OB). Upon intranasal vesicular stomatitis virus instillation, we show an accumulation of activated microglia and monocytes in the OB. Depletion of microglia during encephalitis results in enhanced virus spread and increased lethality. Activation, proliferation, and accumulation of microglia are regulated by type I IFN receptor signaling of neurons and astrocytes, but not of microglia. Morphological analysis of myeloid cells shows that type I IFN receptor signaling of neurons has a stronger impact on the activation of myeloid cells than of astrocytes. Thus, in the infected CNS, the cross talk among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia is critical for full microglia activation and protection from lethal encephalitis.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebrovascular malformations (CVMs) affect approximately 3% of the population, risking hemorrhagic stroke, seizures, and neurological deficits. Recently Ras mutations have been identified in a majority of brain arterio-venous malformations. We generated an endothelial-specific, inducible HRASV12 mouse model, which results in dilated, proliferative blood vessels in the brain, blood-brain barrier breakdown, intracerebral hemorrhage, and rapid lethality. Organoid morphogenesis models revealed abnormal cessation of proliferation, abnormalities in expression of tip and stalk genes, and a failure to properly form elongating tubes. These defects were influenced by both hyperactive PI-3′ kinase signaling and altered TGF-β signaling. Several phenotypic changes predicted by the in vitro morphogenesis analysis were validated in the mouse model. These data provide a model of brain vascular malformations induced by mutant Ras and reveal insights into intersecting molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of brain vascular malformations.

RBM10 is enriched in the heart and associates with Star-PAP (TUT1) to control the expression and 3′ end processing of cardiac mRNAs. The RBM10 RRM2 domain binds the Star-PAP catalytic domain, which directs Star-PAP activity toward polyadenylation. RBM10 binds the pre-mRNA UTR, assembles the Star-PAP complex, and guides this complex specifically to mRNAs encoding anti-hypertrophy regulators. Accordingly, we tested cellular hypertrophy in rat cardiomyoblasts and cardiac hypertrophy (CH) and the subsequent progression to HF in Wistar rat hearts. We demonstrated downregulation of RBM10 during CH and HF. Ectopic re-expression of RBM10 rescued cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. RBM10 depletion evoked a hypertrophic response in H9c2 cells. Our results establish an anti-hypertrophy mechanism mediated by RBM10 in the heart that is directly linked to HF.

Abstract: Summary
A detailed understanding of the mechanisms that establish or maintain the latent reservoir of HIV will guide approaches to eliminate persistent infection. We used a cell line and primary cell models of HIV latency to investigate viral RNA (vRNA) expression and the role of the host transcriptome using single-cell approaches. Single-cell vRNA quantitation identified distinct populations of cells expressing various levels of vRNA, including completely silent populations. Strikingly, single-cell RNA-seq of latently infected primary cells demonstrated that HIV downregulation occurred in diverse transcriptomic environments but was significantly associated with expression of a specific set of cellular genes. In particular, latency was more frequent in cells expressing a transcriptional signature that included markers of naive and central memory T cells. These data reveal that expression of HIV proviruses within the latent reservoir are influenced by the host cell transcriptional program. Therapeutic modulation of these programs may reverse or enforce HIV latency.

Abstract: Summary
Late-phase clinical trials investigating metformin as a cancer therapy are underway. However, there remains controversy as to the mode of action of metformin in tumors at clinical doses. We conducted a clinical study integrating measurement of markers of systemic metabolism, dynamic FDG-PET-CT, transcriptomics, and metabolomics at paired time points to profile the bioactivity of metformin in primary breast cancer. We show metformin reduces the levels of mitochondrial metabolites, activates multiple mitochondrial metabolic pathways, and increases 18-FDG flux in tumors. Two tumor groups are identified with distinct metabolic responses, an OXPHOS transcriptional response (OTR) group for which there is an increase in OXPHOS gene transcription and an FDG response group with increased 18-FDG uptake. Increase in proliferation, as measured by a validated proliferation signature, suggested that patients in the OTR group were resistant to metformin treatment. We conclude that mitochondrial response to metformin in primary breast cancer may define anti-tumor effect.

Abstract: Summary
Through three-dimensional STORM super-resolution microscopy, we resolve the spectrin-actin-based membrane cytoskeleton of neural stem cells (NSCs) and NSC-derived neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. We show that undifferentiated NSCs are capable of forming patches of locally periodic, one-dimensional (1D) membrane cytoskeleton with ∼180 nm periodicity. Such periodic structures become increasingly ordered and long-ranging as the NSCs mature into terminally differentiated neuronal and glial cell types, and, during this process, distinct 1D periodic “strips” dominate the flat 2D membranes. Moreover, we report remarkable alignment of the periodic cytoskeletons between abutting cells at axon-axon and axon-oligodendrocyte contacts and identify two adhesion molecules, neurofascin and L1CAM, as candidates to drive this nanoscale alignment. We thus show that a conserved 1D periodic membrane cytoskeletal motif serves as a nanoscale scaffold and ruler to mediate the physical interactions between cell types of the NSC lineage.

Abstract: Summary
From an organismal perspective, cancer cell populations can be considered analogous to parasites that compete with the host for essential systemic resources such as glucose. Here, we employed leukemia models and human leukemia samples to document a form of adaptive homeostasis, where malignant cells alter systemic physiology through impairment of both host insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion to provide tumors with increased glucose. Mechanistically, tumor cells induce high-level production of IGFBP1 from adipose tissue to mediate insulin sensitivity. Further, leukemia-induced gut dysbiosis, serotonin loss, and incretin inactivation combine to suppress insulin secretion. Importantly, attenuated disease progression and prolonged survival are achieved through disruption of the leukemia-induced adaptive homeostasis. Our studies provide a paradigm for systemic management of leukemic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Sex impacts on liver physiology with severe consequences for energy metabolism and response to xenobiotic, hepatic, and extra-hepatic diseases. The comprehension of the biology subtending sex-related hepatic differences is therefore very relevant in the medical, pharmacological, and dietary perspective. The extensive application of metabolomics paired to transcriptomics here shows that, in the case of short-term fasting, the decision to maintain lipid synthesis using amino acids (aa) as a source of fuel is the key discriminant for the hepatic metabolism of male and female mice. Pharmacological and genetic interventions indicate that the hepatic estrogen receptor (ERα) has a key role in this sex-related strategy that is primed around birth by the aromatase-dependent conversion of testosterone into estradiol. This energy partition strategy, possibly the result of an evolutionary pressure enabling mammals to tailor their reproductive capacities to nutritional status, is most important to direct future sex-specific dietary and medical interventions.

Abstract: Summary
The sense of smell influences many behaviors, yet how odors are represented in the brain remains unclear. A major challenge to studying olfaction is the lack of methods allowing activation of specific types of olfactory neurons in an ethologically relevant setting. To address this, we developed a genetic method in Drosophila called olfactogenetics in which a narrowly tuned odorant receptor, Or56a, is ectopically expressed in different olfactory neuron types. Stimulation with geosmin (the only known Or56a ligand) in an Or56a mutant background leads to specific activation of only target olfactory neuron types. We used this approach to identify olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that directly guide oviposition decisions. We identify 5 OSN-types (Or71a, Or47b, Or49a, Or67b, and Or7a) that, when activated alone, suppress oviposition. Projection neurons partnering with these OSNs share a region of innervation in the lateral horn, suggesting that oviposition site selection might be encoded in this brain region.

Abstract: The RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP) binds to adenosine-uridine AU-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated region of messenger RNAs and facilitates rapid degradation of the target mRNAs. Therefore, it regulates the expression of multiple cancer and immunity-associated transcripts. Furthermore, a lack of TTP in cancer cells influences cancer progression and predicts poor survival. Although the functions of TTP on cancer cells have previously been researched, the mechanism of TTP on the interaction between cancer cells with their microenvironment remains undiscovered. In this study, we admed to determine the role of cancer cell TTP during the interaction between tumor and immune cells, specifically regulatory T cells (Tregs). We evaluate the capability of TTP to modulate the antitumor immunity of GC and explored the underlying mechanism. The overexpression of TTP in GC cells dramatically increased peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocyte (PBML) -mediated cytotoxicity against GC cells. Increased cytotoxicity against TTP-overexpressed GC cells by PBMLs was determined by Treg development and infiltration. Surprisingly, we found the stabilization of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) mRNA was declining while TTP was elevated. The PD-L1 protein level was reduced in TTP-abundant GC cells. PD-L1 gas been found to play a pivotal role in Treg development and functional maintenance in immune system. Taken together, our results suggest the overexpression of TTP in GC cells not only affects cell survival and apoptosis but also increases PBMLs -mediated cytotoxicity against GC cells to decelerate tumor progression. Moreover, we identified PD-L1 as a critical TTP-regulated factor that contributes to inhibiting antitumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Intragenomic conflicts are fueled by rapidly evolving selfish genetic elements, which induce selective pressures to innovate opposing repressive mechanisms. This is patently manifest in sex-ratio (SR) meiotic drive systems, in which distorter and suppressor factors bias and restore equal transmission of X and Y sperm. Here, we reveal that multiple SR suppressors in Drosophila simulans (Nmy and Tmy) encode related hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs), which generate endo-siRNAs that repress the paralogous distorters Dox and MDox. All components in this drive network are recently evolved and largely testis restricted. To connect SR hpRNA function to the RNAi pathway, we generated D. simulans null mutants of Dcr-2 and AGO2. Strikingly, these core RNAi knockouts massively derepress Dox and MDox and are in fact completely male sterile and exhibit highly defective spermatogenesis. Altogether, our data reveal how the adaptive capacity of hpRNAs is critically deployed to restrict selfish gonadal genetic systems that can exterminate a species.

Abstract: Summary
For many years, biologists have focused on the role of Pitx2, expressed on the left side of developing embryos, in governing organ laterality. Here, we identify a different pathway during left-right asymmetry initiated by the right side of the embryo. Surprisingly, this conserved mechanism is orchestrated by the extracellular glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan (HA) and is independent of Pitx2 on the left. Whereas HA is normally synthesized bilaterally as a simple polysaccharide, we show that covalent modification of HA by the enzyme Tsg6 on the right triggers distinct cell behavior necessary to drive the conserved midgut rotation and to pattern gut vasculature. HA disruption in chicken and Tsg6−/− mice results in failure to initiate midgut rotation and perturbs vascular development predisposing to midgut volvulus. Our study leads us to revise the current symmetry-breaking paradigm in vertebrates and demonstrates how enzymatic modification of HA matrices can execute the blueprint of organ laterality.

Abstract: Summary
Genes in higher eukaryotes are regulated by long-range interactions, which can determine what combination of genes is expressed in a chromosomal segment. The choice of the genes can display exclusivity, independence, or co-occurrence. We introduced a simple measure to quantify this interdependence in gene expression and differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells to neurons to measure the single-cell expression of the gene isoforms in the protocadherin (Pcdh) cluster, a key component of neuronal diversity. As the neuronal progenitors mature into neurons, expression of the gene isoforms in the Pcdh array is initially concurrent. Even though the number of the expressed genes is increasing during differentiation, the expression shifts toward exclusivity. The expression frequency correlates highly with CTCF binding to the promoters and follows dynamically the changes in the binding during the differentiation. These findings aid in understanding the interplay between cellular differentiation and stochastic gene choice.

Abstract: Summary
Interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are toxic DNA lesions interfering with DNA metabolism that are induced by widely used anticancer drugs. They have long been considered absolute roadblocks for replication forks, implicating complex DNA repair processes at stalled or converging replication forks. Recent evidence challenged this view, proposing that single forks traverse ICLs by yet elusive mechanisms. Combining ICL immunolabeling and single-molecule approaches in human cells, we now show that ICL induction leads to global replication fork slowing, involving forks not directly challenged by ICLs. Active fork slowing is linked to rapid recruitment of RAD51 to replicating chromatin and to RAD51/ZRANB3-mediated fork reversal. This global modulation of fork speed and architecture requires ATR activation, promotes single-fork ICL traverse—here, directly visualized by electron microscopy—and prevents chromosomal breakage by untimely ICL processing. We propose that global fork slowing by remodeling provides more time for template repair and promotes bypass of residual lesions, limiting fork-associated processing.

Abstract: Summary
In response to activation, CD4+ T cells upregulate autophagy. However, the functional consequences of that upregulation have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we identify autophagy as a tolerance-avoidance mechanism. Our data show that inhibition of autophagy during CD4+ T cell activation induces a long-lasting state of hypo-responsiveness that is accompanied by the expression of an anergic gene signature. Cells unable to induce autophagy after T cell receptor (TCR) engagement show inefficient mitochondrial respiration and decreased turnover of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN1, which translates into defective TCR-mediated signaling. In vivo, inhibition of autophagy during antigen priming induces T cell anergy and decreases the severity of disease in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model. Interestingly, CD4+ T cells isolated from the synovial fluid of juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients, while resistant to suboptimal stimulation-induced anergy, can be tolerized with autophagy inhibitors. We propose that autophagy constitutes a tolerance-avoidance mechanism, which determines CD4+ T cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
Dendrite pruning of Drosophila sensory neurons during metamorphosis is induced by the steroid hormone ecdysone through a transcriptional program. In addition, ecdysone activates the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP) to inhibit cap-dependent translation initiation. To uncover how efficient translation of ecdysone targets is achieved under these conditions, we assessed the requirements for translation initiation factors during dendrite pruning. We found that the canonical cap-binding complex eIF4F is dispensable for dendrite pruning, but the eIF3 complex and the helicase eIF4A are required, indicating that differential translation initiation mechanisms are operating during dendrite pruning. eIF4A and eIF3 are stringently required for translation of the ecdysone target Mical, and this depends on the 5′ UTR of Mical mRNA. Functional analyses indicate that eIF4A regulates eIF3-mRNA interactions in a helicase-dependent manner. We propose that an eIF3-eIF4A-dependent alternative initiation pathway bypasses 4E-BP to ensure adequate translation of ecdysone-induced genes.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known about how individual cells sense the macroscopic geometry of their tissue environment. Here, we explore whether long-range electrical signaling can convey information on tissue geometry to individual cells. First, we studied an engineered electrically excitable cell line. Cells grown in patterned islands of different shapes showed remarkably diverse firing patterns under otherwise identical conditions, including regular spiking, period-doubling alternans, and arrhythmic firing. A Hodgkin-Huxley numerical model quantitatively reproduced these effects, showing how the macroscopic geometry affected the single-cell electrophysiology via the influence of gap junction-mediated electrical coupling. Qualitatively similar geometry-dependent dynamics were observed in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. The cardiac results urge caution in translating observations of arrhythmia in vitro to predictions in vivo, where the tissue geometry is very different. We study how to extrapolate electrophysiological measurements between tissues with different geometries and different gap junction couplings.

Abstract: Summary
In the developing spinal cord, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) attracts commissural axons toward the floorplate. How Shh regulates the cytoskeletal remodeling that underlies growth cone turning is unknown. We found that Shh-mediated growth cone turning requires the activity of Docks, which are unconventional GEFs. Knockdown of Dock3 and 4, or their binding partner ELMO1 and 2, abolished commissural axon attraction by Shh in vitro. Dock3/4 and ELMO1/2 were also required for correct commissural axon guidance in vivo. Polarized Dock activity was sufficient to induce axon turning, indicating that Docks are instructive for axon guidance. Mechanistically, we show that Dock and ELMO interact with Boc, the Shh receptor, and that this interaction is reduced upon Shh stimulation. Furthermore, Shh stimulation translocates ELMO to the growth cone periphery and activates Rac1. This identifies Dock/ELMO as an effector complex of non-canonical Shh signaling and demonstrates the instructive role of GEFs in axon guidance.

Abstract: Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) derived from mouse testis are unipotent in regard of spermatogenesis. Our previous study demonstrated that SSCs can be fully reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells, so called germline-derived pluripotent stem cells (gPS cells), on feeder cells (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), which supports SSC proliferation and induction of pluripotency. Because of an uncontrollable microenvironment caused by interactions with feeder cells, feeder-based SSC reprogramming is not suitable for elucidation of the self-reprogramming mechanism by which SSCs are converted into pluripotent stem cells. Recently, we have established a Matrigel-based SSC expansion culture system that allows long-term SSC proliferation without mouse embryonic fibroblast support. In this study, we developed a new feeder-free SSC self-reprogramming protocol based on the Matrigel-based culture system. The gPS cells generated using a feeder-free reprogramming system showed pluripotency at the molecular and cellular levels. The differentiation potential of gPS cells was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Our study shows for the first time that the induction of SSC pluripotency can be achieved without feeder cells. The newly developed feeder-free self-reprogramming system could be a useful tool to reveal the mechanism by which unipotent cells are self-reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Healthy renal function depends on normal nephrogenesis during embryonic development. However, a comprehensive gene expression profile of human fetal kidney development remains largely unexplored. Here, using a single-cell RNA-sequencing technique, we analyzed >3,000 human fetal renal cells spanning 4 months of development in utero. Unsupervised analysis identified two progenitor subtypes during cap mesenchyme development, suggesting a mechanism for sustaining their progenitor states. Furthermore, we identified critical transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways involved in the segmentation of nephron tubules. We explored the development of the highly heterogeneous collecting duct epithelia and dissected the metabolic gene repertoire and the extracellular matrix composition of the glomerular mesangium. The results provide insights on the molecular basis and regulatory events in human renal development. Moreover, the cell-type-specific expression features of causal genes in congenital renal diseases may be helpful in the treatment of these diseases.

Mammalian sex determination depends on a complex interplay of signals that promote the bipotential fetal gonad to develop as either a testis or an ovary, but the details are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether removal of the signaling molecule retinoic acid (RA) by the degradative enzyme CYP26B1 is necessary for proper development of somatic cells of the testes. Gonadal organ culture experiments suggested that RA promotes expression of some ovarian markers and suppresses expression of some testicular markers, acting downstream of Sox9. XY Cyp26b1-null embryos, in which endogenous RA is not degraded, develop mild ovotestes, but more important, steroidogenesis is impaired and the reproductive tract feminized. Experiments involving purified gonadal cells showed that these effects are independent of germ cells and suggest the direct involvement of the orphan nuclear receptor DAX1. Our results reveal that active removal of endogenous RA is required for normal testis development in the mouse.

Abstract: Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) constitute the major cell population in heart valves. Quiescent fibroblastic VICs are seen in adult healthy valves. They become activated myofibroblastic VICs during development, in diseased valves and in vitro. 2D substrate stiffness within a 5–15 kPa range along with high passage numbers promote VIC activation in vitro. In this study, we characterize VIC quiescence and activation across a 1–21 kPa range of substrate stiffness and passages. We define a cell morphology characterization system for VICs as they transform. We hypothesize that VICs show distinct morphological characteristics in different activation states and the morphology distribution varies with substrate stiffness and passage number. Four VIC morphologies - tailed, spindle, rhomboid and triangle - account for the majority of VIC in this study. Using α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), non-muscle myosin heavy chain B (SMemb) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) as activation markers for validation, we developed a system where we categorize morphology distribution of VIC cultures, to be potentially used as a non-destructive detection method of activation state. We also show that this system can be used to force stiffness-induced deactivation. The reversibility in VIC activation has important implications in in vitro research and tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Local recurrence after surgery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a common event associated with a dismal prognosis. Improving this outcome requires a better understanding of cancer cell populations that expand from postsurgical minimal residual disease (MRD). Therefore, we assessed clonal dynamics in a surgical model of barcoded HNSCC growing in the submental region of immunodeficient mice. Clonal substitution and massive reduction of clonal heterogeneity emerged as hallmarks of local recurrence, as the clones dominating in less heterogeneous recurrences were scarce in their matched primary tumors. These lineages were selected by their ability to persist after surgery and competitively expand from MRD. Clones enriched in recurrences exhibited both private and shared genetic features and likely originated from ancestors shared with clones dominating in primary tumors. They demonstrated high invasiveness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, eventually providing an attractive target for obtaining better local control for these tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Selective block of NaV1.7 promises to produce non-narcotic analgesic activity without motor or cognitive impairment. Several NaV1.7-selective blockers have been reported, but efficacy in animal pain models required high multiples of the IC50 for channel block. Here, we report a target engagement assay using transgenic mice that has enabled the development of a second generation of selective Nav1.7 inhibitors that show robust analgesic activity in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models at low multiples of the IC50. Like earlier arylsulfonamides, these newer acylsulfonamides target a binding site on the surface of voltage sensor domain 4 to achieve high selectivity among sodium channel isoforms and steeply state-dependent block. The improved efficacy correlates with very slow dissociation from the target channel. Chronic dosing increases compound potency about 10-fold, possibly due to reversal of sensitization arising during chronic injury, and provides efficacy that persists long after the compound has cleared from plasma.

Abstract: In pancreatic β cells, glucose stimulates the biosynthesis of insulin at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The RNA-binding protein, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), also named hnRNP I, acts as a critical mediator of insulin biosynthesis through binding to the pyrimidine-rich region in the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of insulin mRNA. However, the underlying mechanism that regulates its expression in β cells is unclear. Here, we report that glucose induces the expression of PTBP1 via the insulin receptor (IR) signaling pathway in β cells. PTBP1 is present in β cells of both mouse and monkey, where its levels are increased by glucose and insulin, but not by insulin-like growth factor 1. PTBP1 levels in immortalized β cells established from wild-type (βIRWT) mice are higher than levels in β cells established from IR-null (βIRKO) mice, and ectopic re-expression of IR-WT in βIRKO cells restored PTBP1 levels. However, PTBP1 levels were not altered in βIRKO cells transfected with IR-3YA, in which the Tyr1158/1162/1163 residues are substituted with Ala. Consistently, treatment with glucose or insulin elevated PTBP1 levels in βIRWT cells, but not in βIRKO cells. In addition, silencing Akt significantly lowered PTBP1 levels. Thus, our results identify insulin as a pivotal mediator of glucose-induced PTBP1 expression in pancreatic β cells.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) are highly dynamic organelles that store neutral lipids. Through a gene overexpression screen in the Drosophila larval fat body, we have identified that MRT, an Myb/switching-defective protein 3 (Swi3), Adaptor 2 (Ada2), Nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR), Transcription factor (TF)IIIB (SANT)-like DNA-binding domain-containing protein, regulates LD size and lipid storage. MRT directly interacts with, and is functionally dependent on, the PZG and NURF chromatin-remodeling complex components. MRT binds to the promoter of plin1, the gene encoding the LD-resident protein perilipin, and inhibits the transcription of plin1. In vitro LD coalescence assays suggest that mrt overexpression or loss of plin1 function facilitates LD coalescence. Our findings suggest that MRT functions together with chromatin-remodeling factors to regulate LD size, likely through the transcriptional repression of plin1.

Abstract: Summary
Cell wall mannans of Candida albicans mask β-(1,3)-glucan from recognition by Dectin-1, contributing to innate immune evasion. Glucan exposures are predominantly single receptor-ligand interaction sites of nanoscale dimensions. Candida species vary in basal glucan exposure and molecular complexity of mannans. We used super-resolution fluorescence imaging and a series of protein mannosylation mutants in C. albicans and C. glabrata to investigate the role of specific N-mannan features in regulating the nanoscale geometry of glucan exposure. Decreasing acid labile mannan abundance and α-(1,6)-mannan backbone length correlated most strongly with increased density and nanoscopic size of glucan exposures in C. albicans and C. glabrata, respectively. Additionally, a C. albicans clinical isolate with high glucan exposure produced similarly perturbed N-mannan structures and elevated glucan exposure geometry. Thus, acid labile mannan structure influences the nanoscale features of glucan exposure, impacting the nature of the pathogenic surface that triggers immunoreceptor engagement, aggregation, and signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Formation of synapses between motor neurons and muscles is initiated by clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the center of muscle fibers prior to nerve arrival. This AChR patterning is considered to be critically dependent on calcium influx through L-type channels (CaV1.1). Using a genetic approach in mice, we demonstrate here that either the L-type calcium currents (LTCCs) or sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release is necessary and sufficient to regulate AChR clustering at the onset of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development. The combined lack of both calcium signals results in loss of AChR patterning and excessive nerve branching. In the absence of SR calcium release, the severity of synapse formation defects inversely correlates with the magnitude of LTCCs. These findings highlight the importance of activity-dependent calcium signaling in early neuromuscular junction formation and indicate that both LTCC and SR calcium release individually support proper innervation of muscle by regulating AChR patterning and motor axon outgrowth.

Abstract: Summary
NPM1 is the most frequently mutated gene in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In AML cells, NPM1 mutations result in abnormal cytoplasmic localization of the mutant protein (NPM1c); however, it is unknown whether NPM1c is required to maintain the leukemic state. Here, we show that loss of NPM1c from the cytoplasm, either through nuclear relocalization or targeted degradation, results in immediate downregulation of homeobox (HOX) genes followed by differentiation. Finally, we show that XPO1 inhibition relocalizes NPM1c to the nucleus, promotes differentiation of AML cells, and prolongs survival of Npm1-mutated leukemic mice. We describe an exquisite dependency of NPM1-mutant AML cells on NPM1c, providing the rationale for the use of nuclear export inhibitors in AML with mutated NPM1.

Abstract: Summary
Aggressive cancers such as glioblastoma (GBM) contain intermingled apoptotic cells adjacent to proliferating tumor cells. Nonetheless, intercellular signaling between apoptotic and surviving cancer cells remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that apoptotic GBM cells paradoxically promote proliferation and therapy resistance of surviving tumor cells by secreting apoptotic extracellular vesicles (apoEVs) enriched with various components of spliceosomes. apoEVs alter RNA splicing in recipient cells, thereby promoting their therapy resistance and aggressive migratory phenotype. Mechanistically, we identified RBM11 as a representative splicing factor that is upregulated in tumors after therapy and shed in extracellular vesicles upon induction of apoptosis. Once internalized in recipient cells, exogenous RBM11 switches splicing of MDM4 and Cyclin D1 toward the expression of more oncogenic isoforms.

Abstract: Summary
The dynamic instability of microtubules is a conserved and fundamental mechanism in eukaryotes. Yet microtubules from different species diverge in their growth rates, lattice structures, and responses to GTP hydrolysis. Therefore, we do not know what limits microtubule growth, what determines microtubule structure, or whether the mechanisms of dynamic instability are universal. Here, we studied microtubules from the nematode C. elegans, which have strikingly fast growth rates and non-canonical lattices in vivo. Using a reconstitution approach, we discovered that C. elegans microtubules combine intrinsically fast growth with very frequent catastrophes. We solved the structure of C. elegans microtubules to 4.8 Å and discovered sequence divergence in the lateral contact loops, one of which is ordered in C. elegans but unresolved in other species. We provide direct evidence that C. elegans tubulin has a higher free energy in solution and propose a model wherein the ordering of lateral contact loops activates tubulin for growth.

Abstract: Summary
The genetics of individual lipid species and their relevance in disease is largely unresolved. We profiled a subset of storage, signaling, membrane, and mitochondrial liver lipids across 385 mice from 47 strains of the BXD mouse population fed chow or high-fat diet and integrated these data with complementary multi-omics datasets. We identified several lipid species and lipid clusters with specific phenotypic and molecular signatures and, in particular, cardiolipin species with signatures of healthy and fatty liver. Genetic analyses revealed quantitative trait loci for 68% of the lipids (lQTL). By multi-layered omics analyses, we show the reliability of lQTLs to uncover candidate genes that can regulate the levels of lipid species. Additionally, we identified lQTLs that mapped to genes associated with abnormal lipid metabolism in human GWASs. This work provides a foundation and resource for understanding the genetic regulation and physiological significance of lipid species.

Abstract: Summary
The dynamic transcriptional regulation and interactions of human germlines and surrounding somatic cells during folliculogenesis remain unknown. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of human oocytes and corresponding granulosa cells (GCs) spanning five follicular stages, we revealed unique features in transcriptional machinery, transcription factor networks, and reciprocal interactions in human oocytes and GCs that displayed developmental-stage-specific expression patterns. Notably, we identified specific gene signatures of two cell types in particular developmental stage that may reflect developmental competency and ovarian reserve. Additionally, we uncovered key pathways that may concert germline-somatic interactions and drive the transition of primordial-to-primary follicle, which represents follicle activation. Thus, our work provides key insights into the crucial features of the transcriptional regulation in the stepwise folliculogenesis and offers important clues for improving follicle recruitment in vivo and restoring fully competent oocytes in vitro.

Abstract: The role of vascular gap junctions in the conduction of intercellular Ca2+ and vasoconstriction along small resistance arteries is not entirely understood. Some depolarizing agents trigger conducted vasoconstriction while others only evoke a local depolarization. Here we use a novel technique to investigate the temporal and spatial relationship between intercellular Ca2+ signals generated by smooth muscle action potentials (APs) and vasoconstriction in mesenteric resistance arteries (MA). Pulses of exogenous KCl to depolarize the downstream end (T1) of a 3 mm long artery increased intracellular Ca2+ associated with vasoconstriction. The spatial spread and amplitude of both depended on the duration of the pulse, with only a restricted non-conducting vasoconstriction to a 1 s pulse. While blocking smooth muscle cell (SMC) K+ channels with TEA and activating L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) with BayK 8644 spread was dramatically facilitated, so the 1 s pulse evoked intercellular Ca2+ waves and vasoconstriction that spread along an entire artery segment 3000 μm long. Ca2+ waves spread as nifedipine-sensitive Ca2+ spikes due to SMC action potentials, and evoked vasoconstriction. Both intercellular Ca2+ and vasoconstriction spread at circa 3 mm s−1 and were independent of the endothelium. The spread but not the generation of Ca2+ spikes was reversibly blocked by the gap junction inhibitor 18β-GA. Thus, smooth muscle gap junctions enable depolarization to spread along resistance arteries, and once regenerative Ca2+-based APs occur, spread along the entire length of an artery followed by widespread vasoconstriction.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue homeostasis involves a complex balance of developmental signals and environmental cues that dictate stem cell function. We found that dietary lipids control enteroendocrine cell production from Drosophila posterior midgut stem cells. Dietary cholesterol influences new intestinal cell differentiation in an Hr96-dependent manner by altering the level and duration of Notch signaling. Exogenous lipids modulate Delta ligand and Notch extracellular domain stability and alter their trafficking in endosomal vesicles. Lipid-modulated Notch signaling occurs in other nutrient-dependent tissues, suggesting that Delta trafficking in many cells is sensitive to cellular sterol levels. These diet-mediated alterations in young animals contribute to a metabolic program that persists after the diet changes. A low-sterol diet also slows the proliferation of enteroendocrine tumors initiated by Notch pathway disruption. Thus, a specific dietary nutrient can modify a key intercellular signaling pathway to shift stem cell differentiation and cause lasting changes in tissue structure and physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Spatial navigation relies on visual landmarks as well as on self-motion information. In familiar environments, both place and grid cells maintain their firing fields in darkness, suggesting that they continuously receive information about locomotion speed required for path integration. Consistently, “speed cells” have been previously identified in the hippocampal formation and characterized in detail in the medial entorhinal cortex. Here we investigated speed-correlated firing in the hippocampus. We show that CA1 has speed cells that are stable across contexts, position in space, and time. Moreover, their speed-correlated firing occurs within theta cycles, independently of theta frequency. Interestingly, a physiological classification of cell types reveals that all CA1 speed cells are inhibitory. In fact, while speed modulates pyramidal cell activity, only the firing rate of interneurons can accurately predict locomotion speed on a sub-second timescale. These findings shed light on network models of navigation.

Abstract: Summary
It is well established that fibrotic remodeling of the tumor microenvironment favors tumorigenesis, but whether fibrosis underlies malignant progression in other ways is unclear. Here, we report that adaptive myofibroblastic reprogramming of osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs) results in a critical advantage when establishing lung macro-metastases and spheroid growth but does not affect the growth of primary lesions or monolayer cultures. FGFR2 signaling in OSCs initiates fibrosis, whereas the resultant fibronectin (FN) auto-deposition sustains fibrogenic reprogramming and OSC growth, resembling the process employed by non-malignant myofibroblasts to cause tissue fibrosis. Furthermore, we provide evidence that nintedanib targets the pan FGFR-FN axis to disrupt lung metastasis without affecting the bone lesion growth of OSCs. Thus, myofibroblastic reprogramming of human OSCs in the lungs might represent a druggable trait for treating a deadly metastatic complication.

Inflammatory cytokines increased peptide presentation in vitro, paralleling upregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression. Peptide sources featured several insulin granule proteins and all known β cell antigens, barring islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein. Preproinsulin yielded HLA-A2-restricted epitopes previously described. Secretogranin V and its mRNA splice isoform SCG5-009, proconvertase-2, urocortin-3, the insulin gene enhancer protein ISL-1, and an islet amyloid polypeptide transpeptidation product emerged as antigens processed into HLA-A2-restricted epitopes, which, as those already described, were recognized by circulating naive CD8+ T cells in T1D and healthy donors and by pancreas-infiltrating cells in T1D donors. This peptidome opens new avenues to understand antigen processing by β cells and for the development of T cell biomarkers and tolerogenic vaccination strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with pan-ebolavirus cross-reactivity are highly desirable, but development of such mAbs is limited by a lack of a molecular understanding of cross-reactive epitopes. The antibody ADI-15878 was previously identified from a human survivor of Ebola virus Makona variant (EBOV/Mak) infection. This mAb demonstrated potent neutralizing activity against all known ebolaviruses and provided protection in rodent and ferret models against three ebolavirus species. Here, we describe the unliganded crystal structure of ADI-15878 as well as the cryo-EM structures of ADI-15878 in complex with the EBOV/Mak and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) glycoproteins (GPs). ADI-15878 binds through an induced-fit mechanism by targeting highly conserved residues in the internal fusion loop (IFL), bridging across GP protomers via the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region. Our structures provide a more complete description of the ebolavirus immunogenic landscape, as well as a molecular basis for how rare but potent antibodies target conserved filoviral fusion machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Post-ingestive signals conveying information about the nutritive properties of food are critical for regulating ingestive behavior. Here, using an auction task concomitant to fMRI scanning, we demonstrate that participants are willing to pay more for fat + carbohydrate compared with equally familiar, liked, and caloric fat or carbohydrate foods and that this potentiated reward is associated with response in areas critical for reward valuation, including the dorsal striatum and mediodorsal thalamus. We also show that individuals are better able to estimate the energy density of fat compared with carbohydrate and fat + carbohydrate foods, an effect associated with functional connectivity between visual (fusiform gyrus) and valuation (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) areas. These results provide the first demonstration that foods high in fat and carbohydrate are, calorie for calorie, valued more than foods containing only fat or carbohydrate and that this effect is associated with greater recruitment of central reward circuits.

Abstract: Summary
There is a pressing need to identify therapeutic targets in tumors with low mutation rates such as the malignant pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma. To address this challenge, we quantitatively profiled global proteomes and phospho-proteomes of 45 medulloblastoma samples. Integrated analyses revealed that tumors with similar RNA expression vary extensively at the post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. We identified distinct pathways associated with two subsets of SHH tumors, and found post-translational modifications of MYC that are associated with poor outcomes in group 3 tumors. We found kinases associated with subtypes and showed that inhibiting PRKDC sensitizes MYC-driven cells to radiation. Our study shows that proteomics enables a more comprehensive, functional readout, providing a foundation for future therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
The Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial reported return and persistence of non-diabetic blood glucose control in 46% of people with type 2 diabetes of up to 6 years duration. Detailed metabolic studies were performed on a subgroup (intervention, n = 64; control, n = 26). In the intervention group, liver fat content decreased (16.0% ± 1.3% to 3.1% ± 0.5%, p < 0.0001) immediately after weight loss. Similarly, plasma triglyceride and pancreas fat content decreased whether or not glucose control normalized. Recovery of first-phase insulin response (0.04[−0.05–0.32] to 0.11[0.0005–0.51] nmol/min/m2, p < 0.0001) defined those who returned to non-diabetic glucose control and this was durable at 12 months (0.11[0.005–0.81] nmol/min/m2, p = 0.0001). Responders were similar to non-responders at baseline but had shorter diabetes duration (2.7 ± 0.3 versus 3.8 ± 0.4 years; p = 0.02). This study demonstrates that β cell ability to recover long-term function persists after diagnosis, changing the previous paradigm of irreversible loss of β cell function in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells (NSCs) are valuable for both basic research and clinical application. We previously reported a chemical cocktail that could reprogram somatic cells into neural progenitor cells. However, the reprogramming process is complex, and the underlying mechanism remains largely elusive. Here, we identified a culture condition that greatly promotes the efficiency of NSC generation directly from mouse fibroblasts based on our reported chemical cocktail. Transcriptome and epigenome analyses demonstrated that growth factors including IL-6, FGF5, and LIF were dynamically activated and contributed to the cell fate changes. Treatment of these growth factors together can enable fibroblast to neural progenitor-like cell conversion. Moreover, the reprogramming capacity of both chemical cocktail and growth factors requires nucleoporin Nup210 to activate SoxB1 transcription factors to initiate NSC fate. Altogether, our findings reveal important roles of both extracellular signals and internal factors in direct cellular reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
The increasing throughput and sharing of proteomics mass spectrometry data have now yielded over one-third of a million public mass spectrometry runs. However, these discoveries are not continuously aggregated in an open and error-controlled manner, which limits their utility. To facilitate the reusability of these data, we built the MassIVE Knowledge Base (MassIVE-KB), a community-wide, continuously updating knowledge base that aggregates proteomics mass spectrometry discoveries into an open reusable format with full provenance information for community scrutiny. Reusing >31 TB of public human data stored in a mass spectrometry interactive virtual environment (MassIVE), the MassIVE-KB contains >2.1 million precursors from 19,610 proteins (48% larger than before; 97% of the total) and doubles proteome coverage to 6 million amino acids (54% of the proteome) with strict library-scale false discovery controls, thereby providing evidence for 430 proteins for which sufficient protein-level evidence was previously missing. Furthermore, MassIVE-KB can inform experimental design, helps identify and quantify new data, and provides tools for community construction of specialized spectral libraries.

Abstract: Summary
Despite extensive efforts, oncogenic KRAS remains resistant to targeted therapy. Combined downstream RAL-TBK1 and MEK inhibition induces only transient lung tumor shrinkage in KRAS-driven genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). Using the sensitive KRAS;LKB1 (KL) mutant background, we identify YAP1 upregulation and a therapy-induced secretome as mediators of acquired resistance. This program is reversible, associated with H3K27 promoter acetylation, and suppressed by BET inhibition, resensitizing resistant KL cells to TBK1/MEK inhibition. Constitutive YAP1 signaling promotes intrinsic resistance in KRAS;TP53 (KP) mutant lung cancer. Intermittent treatment with the BET inhibitor JQ1 thus overcomes resistance to combined pathway inhibition in KL and KP GEMMs. Using potent and selective TBK1 and BET inhibitors we further develop an effective therapeutic strategy with potential translatability to the clinic.

Abstract: Summary
The cilia and cell cycles are inextricably linked. Centrioles in the basal body of cilia nucleate the ciliary axoneme and sequester pericentriolar matrix (PCM) at the centrosome to organize the mitotic spindle. Cilia themselves respond to growth signals, prompting cilia resorption and cell cycle re-entry. We describe a fluorescent cilia and cell cycle biosensor allowing live imaging of cell cycle progression and cilia assembly and disassembly kinetics in cells and inducible mice. We define assembly and disassembly in relation to cell cycle stage with single-cell resolution and explore the intercellular heterogeneity in cilia kinetics. In all cells and tissues analyzed, we observed cilia that persist through the G1/S transition and into S/G2/M-phase. We conclude that persistence of cilia after the G1/S transition is a general property. This resource will shed light at an individual cell level on the interplay between the cilia and cell cycles in development, regeneration, and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Disruption of human fetal testis development is widely accepted to underlie testicular germ cell cancer (TGCC) origin and additional disorders within testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS). However, the mechanisms for the development of testicular dysgenesis in humans are unclear. We used ex vivo culture and xenograft approaches to investigate the importance of Nodal and Activin signaling in human fetal testis development. Inhibition of Nodal, and to some extent Activin, signaling disrupted seminiferous cord formation, abolished AMH expression, reduced androgen secretion, and decreased gonocyte numbers. Subsequent xenografting of testicular tissue rescued the disruptive effects on seminiferous cords and somatic cells but not germ cell effects. Stimulation of Nodal signaling increased the number of germ cells expressing pluripotency factors, and these persisted after xenografting. Our findings suggest a key role for Nodal signaling in the regulation of gonocyte differentiation and early human testis development with implications for the understanding of TGCC and TDS origin.

Abstract: Summary
A significant proportion of cancer patients do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these treatments, we explored the role of CD4+Foxp3− T cells expressing PD-1 (4PD1hi) and observed that 4PD1hi accumulate intratumorally as a function of tumor burden. Interestingly, CTLA-4 blockade promotes intratumoral and peripheral 4PD1hi increases in a dose-dependent manner, while combination with PD-1 blockade mitigates this effect and improves anti-tumor activity. We found that lack of effective 4PD1hi reduction after anti-PD-1 correlates with poor prognosis. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that mouse and human circulating and intra-tumor 4PD1hi inhibit T cell functions in a PD-1/PD-L1 dependent fashion and resemble follicular helper T cell (TFH)-like cells. Accordingly, anti-CTLA-4 activity is improved in TFH deficient mice.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear protein in testis (Nut) is a universal oncogenic driver in the highly aggressive NUT midline carcinoma, whose physiological function in male germ cells has been unclear. Here we show that expression of Nut is normally restricted to post-meiotic spermatogenic cells, where its presence triggers p300-dependent genome-wide histone H4 hyperacetylation, which is essential for the completion of histone-to-protamine exchange. Accordingly, the inactivation of Nut induces male sterility with spermatogenesis arrest at the histone-removal stage. Nut uses p300 and/or CBP to enhance acetylation of H4 at both K5 and K8, providing binding sites for the first bromodomain of Brdt, the testis-specific member of the BET family, which subsequently mediates genome-wide histone removal. Altogether, our data reveal the detailed molecular basis of the global histone hyperacetylation wave, which occurs before the final compaction of the male genome.

Abstract: Summary
We examined hematopoietic protein kinase 1 (HPK1), whose reliance on scaffold versus kinase functions for negative immune cell regulation is poorly understood and critical to its assessment as a viable drug target. We identify kinase-dependent roles for HPK1 in CD8 T cells that restrict their anti-viral and anti-tumor responses by using HPK1 kinase-dead (HPK1.kd) knockin mice. Loss of HPK1 kinase function enhanced T cell receptor signaling and cytokine secretion in a T-cell-intrinsic manner. In response to chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection or tumor challenge, viral clearance and tumor growth inhibition were enhanced in HPK1.kd mice, accompanied by an increase in effector CD8 T cell function. Co-blockade of PD-L1 further enhanced T effector cell function, resulting in superior anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity over single target blockade. These results identify the importance of HPK1 kinase activity in the negative regulation of CD8 effector functions, implicating its potential as a cancer immunotherapy target.

Abstract: Summary
There is increasing interest in therapeutically exploiting metabolic differences between normal and cancer cells. We show that kinase inhibitors (KIs) and biguanides synergistically and selectively target a variety of cancer cells. Synthesis of non-essential amino acids (NEAAs) aspartate, asparagine, and serine, as well as glutamine metabolism, are major determinants of the efficacy of KI/biguanide combinations. The mTORC1/4E-BP axis regulates aspartate, asparagine, and serine synthesis by modulating mRNA translation, while ablation of 4E-BP1/2 substantially decreases sensitivity of breast cancer and melanoma cells to KI/biguanide combinations. Efficacy of the KI/biguanide combinations is also determined by HIF-1α-dependent perturbations in glutamine metabolism, which were observed in VHL-deficient renal cancer cells. This suggests that cancer cells display metabolic plasticity by engaging non-redundant adaptive mechanisms, which allows them to survive therapeutic insults that target cancer metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues to cause substantial human mortality, in part because of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance in tuberculosis is solely the result of chromosomal mutations that modify drug activators or targets, yet the mechanisms controlling the mycobacterial DNA-damage response (DDR) remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify RecA serine 207 as a multifunctional signaling hub that controls the DDR in mycobacteria. RecA S207 is phosphorylated after DNA damage, which suppresses the emergence of antibiotic resistance by selectively inhibiting the LexA coprotease function of RecA without affecting its ATPase or strand exchange functions. Additionally, RecA associates with the cytoplasmic membrane during the mycobacterial DDR, where cardiolipin can specifically inhibit the LexA coprotease function of unmodified, but not S207 phosphorylated, RecA. These findings reveal that RecA S207 controls mutagenesis and antibiotic resistance in mycobacteria through phosphorylation and cardiolipin-mediated inhibition of RecA coprotease function.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogen drives breast cancer (BCa) progression by directly activating estrogen receptor α (ERα). However, because of the stochastic nature of gene transcription, it is important to study the estrogen signaling pathway at the single-cell level to fully understand how ERα regulates transcription. Here, we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis on ERα-positive BCa cells following 17β-estradiol stimulation and reconstructed the dynamic estrogen-responsive transcriptional network from discrete time points into a pseudotemporal continuum. Notably, differentially expressed genes show an estrogen-stimulated metabolic switch that favors biosynthesis but reduces estrogen degradation. Moreover, folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is reprogrammed through the mitochondrial folate pathway and polyamine and purine synthesis are upregulated coordinately. Finally, we show AZIN1 and PPAT are direct ERα targets that are essential for BCa cell survival and growth. In summary, our study highlights the dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity in ERα-positive BCa cells upon estrogen stimulation and uncovers a mechanism of estrogen-mediated metabolic switch.

Abstract: Summary
Many immune receptors transduce activation across the plasma membrane through their clustering. With Fcγ receptors (FcγRs), this clustering is driven by binding to antibodies of differing affinities that are in turn bound to multivalent antigen. As a consequence of this activation mechanism, accounting for and rationally manipulating immunoglobulin (Ig)G effector function is complicated by, among other factors, differing affinities between FcγR species and changes in the valency of antigen binding. In this study, we show that a model of multivalent receptor-ligand binding can effectively account for the contribution of IgG-FcγR affinity and immune complex valency. This model in turn enables us to make specific predictions about the effect of immune complexes of defined composition. In total, these results enable both rational immune complex design for a desired IgG effector function and the deconvolution of effector function by immune complexes.

Abstract: Summary
The current consensus recognizes four main medulloblastoma subgroups (wingless, Sonic hedgehog, group 3 and group 4). While medulloblastoma subgroups have been characterized extensively at the (epi-)genomic and transcriptomic levels, the proteome and phosphoproteome landscape remain to be comprehensively elucidated. Using quantitative (phospho)-proteomics in primary human medulloblastomas, we unravel distinct posttranscriptional regulation leading to highly divergent oncogenic signaling and kinase activity profiles in groups 3 and 4 medulloblastomas. Specifically, proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses identify aberrant ERBB4-SRC signaling in group 4. Hence, enforced expression of an activated SRC combined with p53 inactivation induces murine tumors that resemble group 4 medulloblastoma. Therefore, our integrative proteogenomics approach unveils an oncogenic pathway and potential therapeutic vulnerability in the most common medulloblastoma subgroup.

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo pathway plays a crucial role in organ size control and tumor suppression, but its precise regulation is not fully understood. In this study, we discovered that phosphatidic acid (PA)-related lipid signaling is a key regulator of the Hippo pathway. Supplementing PA in various Hippo-activating conditions activates YAP. This PA-related lipid signaling is involved in Rho-mediated YAP activation. Mechanistically, PA directly interacts with Hippo components LATS and NF2 to disrupt LATS-MOB1 complex formation and NF2-mediated LATS membrane translocation and activation, respectively. Inhibition of phospholipase D (PLD)-dependent PA production suppresses YAP oncogenic activities. PLD1 is highly expressed in breast cancer and positively correlates with YAP activation, suggesting their pathological relevance in breast cancer development. Taken together, our study not only reveals a role of PLD-PA lipid signaling in regulating the Hippo pathway but also indicates that the PLD-PA-YAP axis is a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomes play a critical role in maintenance of the integrity of neuronal function, and mutations in genes that contribute to lysosome formation, transport, and activity are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, the multisubunit complex, BLOC-one-related complex (BORC), has been shown to be involved in positioning lysosomes within the cytoplasm, although the consequences of altered BORC function in adult animals have not been established. We show that a spontaneous truncation mutation in the mouse Borcs7 gene, identified through whole-genome sequencing followed by genetic complementation, results in progressive axonal dystrophy with dramatic impairment of motor function. Furthermore, mice homozygous for deletion of the entire Borcs7 coding sequence die shortly after birth, and neurons cultured from these animals show impaired centrifugal transport of lysosomes. This identifies BORCS7 as a central factor in axonal transport of lysosomes and a possible target for improving disease-related disturbances in this important function.

Abstract: Summary
Apoptotic cell death removes unwanted cells and is regulated by interactions between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 protein family. The regulation of apoptosis is thought to be crucial for normal embryonic development. Accordingly, complete loss of pro-survival MCL-1 or BCL-XL (BCL2L1) causes embryonic lethality. However, it is not known whether minor reductions in pro-survival proteins could cause developmental abnormalities. We explored the rate-limiting roles of MCL-1 and BCL-XL in development and show that combined loss of single alleles of Mcl-1 and Bcl-x causes neonatal lethality. Mcl-1+/–;Bcl-x+/– mice display craniofacial anomalies, but additional loss of a single allele of pro-apoptotic Bim (Bcl2l11) restores normal development. These findings demonstrate that the control of cell survival during embryogenesis is finely balanced and suggest that some human craniofacial defects, for which causes are currently unknown, may be due to subtle imbalances between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members.

Abstract: Summary
Microdeletions involving TBX1 result in variable congenital malformations known collectively as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS). Tbx1-deficient mice and zebrafish recapitulate several disease phenotypes, including pharyngeal arch artery (PAA), head muscle (HM), and cardiac outflow tract (OFT) deficiencies. In zebrafish, these structures arise from nkx2.5+ progenitors in pharyngeal arches 2–6. Because pharyngeal arch morphogenesis is compromised in Tbx1-deficient animals, the malformations were considered secondary. Here, we report that the PAA, HM, and OFT phenotypes in tbx1 mutant zebrafish are primary and arise prior to pharyngeal arch morphogenesis from failed specification of the nkx2.5+ pharyngeal lineage. Through in situ analysis and lineage tracing, we reveal that nkx2.5 and tbx1 are co-expressed in this progenitor population. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that gdf3-ALK4 signaling is a downstream mediator of nkx2.5+ pharyngeal lineage specification. Collectively, these studies support a cellular mechanism potentially underlying the cardiovascular and craniofacial defects observed in the 22q11.2DS population.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy, a stress-induced lysosomal degradative pathway, has been assumed to exert similar metabolic effects in different organs. Here, we establish a model where autophagy plays different roles in insulin-producing β cells versus insulin-responsive cells, utilizing knockin (Becn1F121A) mice manifesting constitutively active autophagy. With a high-fat-diet challenge, the autophagy-hyperactive mice unexpectedly show impaired glucose tolerance, but improved insulin sensitivity, compared to mice with normal autophagy. Autophagy hyperactivation enhances insulin signaling, via suppressing ER stress in insulin-responsive cells, but decreases insulin secretion by selectively sequestrating and degrading insulin granule vesicles in β cells, a process we term “vesicophagy.” The reduction in insulin storage, insulin secretion, and glucose tolerance is reversed by transient treatment of autophagy inhibitors. Thus, β cells and insulin-responsive tissues require different autophagy levels for optimal function. To improve insulin sensitivity without hampering secretion, acute or intermittent, rather than chronic, activation of autophagy should be considered in diabetic therapy development.

Abstract: Summary
The co-engagement of fragment crystallizable (Fc) gamma receptors (FcγRs) with the Fc region of recombinant immunoglobulin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and its contribution to therapeutic activity has been extensively studied. For example, Fc-FcγR interactions have been shown to be important for mAb-directed effector cell activities, as well as mAb-dependent forward signaling into target cells via receptor clustering. Here we identify a function of mAbs targeting T cell-expressed antigens that involves FcγR co-engagement on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In the case of mAbs targeting CTLA-4 and TIGIT, the interaction with FcγR on APCs enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses and tumoricidal activity. This mechanism extended to an anti-CD45RB mAb, which led to FcγR-dependent regulatory T cell expansion in mice.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotency is accompanied by the erasure of parental epigenetic memory, with naïve pluripotent cells exhibiting global DNA hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. Exit from pluripotency and priming for differentiation into somatic lineages is associated with genome-wide de novo DNA methylation. We show that during this phase, co-expression of enzymes required for DNA methylation turnover, DNMT3s and TETs, promotes cell-to-cell variability in this epigenetic mark. Using a combination of single-cell sequencing and quantitative biophysical modeling, we show that this variability is associated with coherent, genome-scale oscillations in DNA methylation with an amplitude dependent on CpG density. Analysis of parallel single-cell transcriptional and epigenetic profiling provides evidence for oscillatory dynamics both in vitro and in vivo. These observations provide insights into the emergence of epigenetic heterogeneity during early embryo development, indicating that dynamic changes in DNA methylation might influence early cell fate decisions.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomes perform protein synthesis but are also involved in signaling processes, the full extent of which are still being uncovered. We report that phenotypes of mutating ribosomal proteins (Rps) are largely due to signaling. Using Drosophila, we discovered that a bZip-domain protein, Xrp1, becomes elevated in Rp mutant cells. Xrp1 reduces translation and growth, delays development, is responsible for gene expression changes, and causes the cell competition of Rp heterozygous cells from genetic mosaics. Without Xrp1, even cells homozygously deleted for Rp genes persist and grow. Xrp1 induction in Rp mutant cells depends on a particular Rp with regulatory effects, RpS12, and precedes overall changes in translation. Thus, effects of Rp mutations, even the reductions in translation and growth, depend on signaling through the Xrp1 pathway and are not simply consequences of reduced ribosome production limiting protein synthesis. One benefit of this system may be to eliminate Rp-mutant cells by cell competition.

Abstract: Summary
A common assumption is that human chromosomes carry equal chances of mis-segregation during compromised cell division. Human chromosomes vary in multiple parameters that might generate bias, but technological limitations have precluded a comprehensive analysis of chromosome-specific aneuploidy. Here, by imaging specific centromeres coupled with high-throughput single-cell analysis as well as single-cell sequencing, we show that aneuploidy occurs non-randomly following common treatments to elevate chromosome mis-segregation. Temporary spindle disruption leads to elevated mis-segregation and aneuploidy of a subset of chromosomes, particularly affecting chromosomes 1 and 2. Unexpectedly, we find that a period of mitotic delay weakens centromeric cohesion and promotes chromosome mis-segregation and that chromosomes 1 and 2 are particularly prone to suffer cohesion fatigue. Our findings demonstrate that inherent properties of individual chromosomes can bias chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy rates, with implications for studies on aneuploidy in human disease.

Abstract: Summary
Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and Axin are core components of the β-catenin destruction complex. How APC’s function is regulated and whether Wnt signaling influences the direct APC-Axin interaction to inhibit the β-catenin destruction complex is not clear. Through a CRISPR screen of β-catenin stability, we have identified ICAT, a polypeptide previously known to block β-catenin-TCF interaction, as a natural inhibitor of APC. ICAT blocks β-catenin-APC interaction and prevents β-catenin-mediated APC-Axin interaction, enhancing stabilization of β-catenin in cells harboring truncated APC or stimulated with Wnt, but not in cells deprived of a Wnt signal. Using ICAT as a tool to disengage β-catenin-mediated APC-Axin interaction, we demonstrate that Wnt quickly inhibits the direct interaction between APC and Axin. Our study highlights an important scaffolding function of β-catenin in the assembly of the destruction complex and suggests Wnt-inhibited APC-Axin interaction as a mechanism of Wnt-dependent inhibition of the destruction complex.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic control of regulatory networks is only partially understood. Expression of Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF2) is controlled by genomic imprinting, mediated by silencing of the maternal allele. Loss of imprinting of IGF2 (LOI) is linked to intestinal and colorectal cancers, causally in murine models and epidemiologically in humans. However, the molecular underpinnings of the LOI phenotype are not clear. Surprisingly, in LOI cells, we find a reversal of the relative activities of two canonical signaling pathways triggered by IGF2, causing further rebalancing between pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling. A predictive mathematical model shows that this network rebalancing quantitatively accounts for the effect of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition in both WT and LOI cells. This mechanism also quantitatively explains both the stable LOI phenotype and the therapeutic window for selective killing of LOI cells, and thus prevention of epigenetically controlled cancers. These findings suggest a framework for understanding epigenetically modified cell signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has a pro-tumorigenic function via its pro-angiogenic and anti-apoptotic activities. Here, we demonstrate that PAI-1 promotes the recruitment and M2 polarization of monocytes/macrophages through different structural domains. Its LRP1 interacting domain regulated macrophage migration, while its C-terminal uPA interacting domain promoted M2 macrophage polarization through activation of p38MAPK and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and induction of an autocrine interleukin (IL)-6/STAT3 activation pathway. We then show in several experiments in mice that expression of PAI-1 is associated with increased tumorigenicity, increased presence of M2 macrophages, higher levels of IL-6, and increased STAT3 phosphorylation in macrophages. Strong positive correlations between PAI-1, IL-6, and CD163 (M2 marker) expression were also found by meta-analysis of transcriptome data in many human cancers. Altogether, these data provide evidence for a mechanism explaining the paradoxical pro-tumorigenic function of PAI-1 in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cachexia is characterized by extreme skeletal muscle loss that results in high morbidity and mortality. The incidence of cachexia varies among tumor types, being lowest in sarcomas, whereas 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients experience severe weight loss. How these tumors trigger muscle depletion is still unfolding. Serendipitously, we found that overexpression of Twist1 in mouse muscle progenitor cells, either constitutively during development or inducibly in adult animals, caused severe muscle atrophy with features reminiscent of cachexia. Using several genetic mouse models of PDAC, we detected a marked increase in Twist1 expression in muscle undergoing cachexia. In cancer patients, elevated levels of Twist1 are associated with greater degrees of muscle wasting. Finally, both genetic and pharmacological inactivation of Twist1 in muscle progenitor cells afforded substantial protection against cancer-mediated cachexia, which translated into meaningful survival benefits, implicating Twist1 as a possible target for attenuating muscle cachexia in cancer patients.

Abstract: Summary
Sex differences in brain structure and function are of substantial scientific interest because of sex-related susceptibility to psychiatric and neurological disorders. Neuroinflammation is a common denominator of many of these diseases, and thus microglia, as the brain’s immunocompetent cells, have come into focus in sex-specific studies. Here, we show differences in the structure, function, and transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in microglia freshly isolated from male and female mouse brains. We show that male microglia are more frequent in specific brain areas, have a higher antigen-presenting capacity, and appear to have a higher potential to respond to stimuli such as ATP, reflected in higher baseline outward and inward currents and higher protein expression of purinergic receptors. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive resource to generate and validate hypotheses regarding brain sex differences.

Abstract: Summary
While meta-analysis has demonstrated increased statistical power and more robust estimations in studies, the application of this commonly accepted methodology to cytometry data has been challenging. Different cytometry studies often involve diverse sets of markers. Moreover, the detected values of the same marker are inconsistent between studies due to different experimental designs and cytometer configurations. As a result, the cell subsets identified by existing auto-gating methods cannot be directly compared across studies. We developed MetaCyto for automated meta-analysis of both flow and mass cytometry (CyTOF) data. By combining clustering methods with a silhouette scanning method, MetaCyto is able to identify commonly labeled cell subsets across studies, thus enabling meta-analysis. Applying MetaCyto across a set of ten heterogeneous cytometry studies totaling 2,926 samples enabled us to identify multiple cell populations exhibiting differences in abundance between demographic groups. Software is released to the public through Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MetaCyto.html).

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial respiratory chain is organized in a dynamic set of supercomplexes (SCs). The COX7A2L protein is essential for mammalian SC III2+IV assembly. However, its function in respirasome (SCs I+III2+IVn) biogenesis remains controversial. To unambiguously determine the COX7A2L role, we generated COX7A2L-knockout (COX7A2L-KO) HEK293T and U87 cells. COX7A2L-KO cells lack SC III2+IV but have enhanced complex III steady-state levels, activity, and assembly rate, normal de novo complex IV biogenesis, and delayed respirasome formation. Nonetheless, the KOs have normal respirasome steady-state levels, and only larger structures (SCs I1-2+III2+IV2-n or megacomplexes) were undetected. Functional substrate-driven competition assays showed normal mitochondrial respiration in COX7A2L-KO cells in standard and nutritional-, environmental-, and oxidative-stress-challenging conditions. We conclude that COX7A2L establishes a regulatory checkpoint for the biogenesis of CIII2 and specific SCs, but the COX7A2L-dependent MRC remodeling is essential neither to maintain mitochondrial bioenergetics nor to cope with acute cellular stresses.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitination is essential for protein degradation and signaling and pivotal to many physiological processes. Ubiquitination of a subset of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by the E3 ligase NEDD4-2 is required for p38 activation, but how GPCRs activate NEDD4-2 to promote ubiquitin-mediated signaling is not known. Here, we report that the GPCR protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) stimulates c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of NEDD4-2 to promote p38 signaling and endothelial barrier disruption. Using mass spectrometry, we identified a unique phosphorylated tyrosine (Y)-485 within the 2,3-linker peptide between WW domain 2 and 3 of NEDD4-2 in agonist-stimulated cells. Mutation of NEDD4-2 Y485 impaired E3 ligase activity and failed to rescue PAR1-stimulated p38 activation and endothelial barrier permeability. The purinergic P2Y1 receptor also required c-Src and NEDD4-2 tyrosine phosphorylation for p38 activation. These studies reveal a novel role for c-Src in GPCR-induced NEDD4-2 activation, which is critical for driving ubiquitin-mediated p38 inflammatory signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5) plays an important function in innate immunity and in initiating pro-inflammatory responses against pathogens. IRF-5 is constitutively expressed in several cell types, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes, and B cells. We have previously reported that IRF-5 is also expressed in T cells during infection. The role of IRF-5 in T cells is yet unknown. Here, we demonstrate that IRF-5 is increasingly expressed in interferon (IFN)-γ+ CD4 T cells over the course of L. donovani infection. This transcription factor is induced by apoptotic material via Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and promotes the expression of death receptor 5 (DR5). IRF-5 activation sensitizes CD4 T cells to cell death. Because tissue disruption and chronic inflammation are common characteristics of persistent infections, activation of IRF-5 in CD4 T cells may represent a common pathway that leads to suppression of protective CD4 T cell responses, favoring the establishment of chronic infection.

Abstract: Summary
Phase separation represents an important form of subcellular compartmentalization. However, relatively little is known about how the formation or disassembly of such compartments is regulated. In zebrafish, the Balbiani body (Bb) and the germ plasm (Gp) are intimately linked phase-separated structures essential for germ cell specification and home to many germ cell-specific mRNAs and proteins. Throughout development, these structures occur as a single large aggregate (Bb), which disperses throughout oogenesis and upon fertilization accumulates again into relatively large assemblies (Gp). Formation of the Bb requires Bucky ball (Buc), a protein with prion-like properties. We found that the multi-tudor domain-containing protein Tdrd6a interacts with Buc, affecting its mobility and aggregation properties. Importantly, lack of this regulatory interaction leads to significant defects in germ cell development. Our work presents insights into how prion-like protein aggregations can be regulated and highlights the biological relevance of such regulatory events.

Abstract: Summary
How embryonic progenitors coordinate cell fate specification and establish transcriptional and signaling competence is a fundamental question in developmental biology. Here, we show that transcription factor ΔNp63 profoundly changes the transcriptome and remodels thousands of open chromatin regions of Krt8+ progenitors during epidermal fate specification. ATAC-seq and single-cell RNA-seq reveal that ΔNp63-dependent programs govern epidermal lineage formation, and ΔNp63-independent programs, mediated by AP2 and AP1 transcription factors, promote epidermal differentiation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. ΔNp63 promotes Wnt signaling by directly upregulating Wnt ligands, Frizzled receptors, and transcription factors. Deletion of β-catenin in Krt8+ progenitors delays their maturation into Krt5+ progenitors. The lack of epidermal Wnt production in the absence of ΔNp63 also incapacitates Wnt activation in the underlying dermal cells. These findings reveal the remarkable changes of the transcriptome, open chromatin, and signaling pathways at the onset of skin development and uncover the molecular cascade for epidermal lineage formation.

Abstract: K+-dependent Na+-Ca2+ exchangers (NCKXs) belong to Ca2+/cation antiporter gene superfamily. NCKX proteins play an important role in Ca2+ homeostasis and are bi-directional plasma membrane Ca2+-transporters which utilize the inward Na+ and outward K+ gradients to move Ca2+ ions into and out of the cytosol (4Na+:1Ca2+ + 1 K+). In this study, we examined residues in the two regions with the highest degree of homology between the different NCKX isoforms (α-1 and α-2 repeats) to determine which residues are important for Ca2+ coordination. Using fluorescent intracellular Ca2+-indicating dyes, we measured NCKX-mediated Ca2+ transport in HEK293 cells expressing wildtype or mutant NCKX2 and analyzed shifts in the apparent binding affinity (Km) of mutant proteins when compared to the wildtype exchanger. Of the 93 residue substitutions tested, 31 were found to show a significant shift in the external Ca2+ ion dependence of which 18 showed an increased affinity to Ca2+ ions and 13 showed a decreased affinity, and, hence, are believed to be important for Ca2+ ion binding and transport. When compared to the crystal structure of the archaeal Na+-Ca2+ exchanger NCX_Mj and the NCKX2 homology model based on this crystal structure, our biochemical data reveal that these 13 residues are either in direct contact with the Ca2+ ion or lining a Ca2+ transport pathway through the exchanger.

Abstract: Summary
The exon junction complex (EJC) deposited upstream of mRNA exon junctions shapes structure, composition, and fate of spliced mRNA ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs). To achieve this, the EJC core nucleates assembly of a dynamic shell of peripheral proteins that function in diverse post-transcriptional processes. To illuminate consequences of EJC composition change, we purified EJCs from human cells via peripheral proteins RNPS1 and CASC3. We show that the EJC originates as an SR-rich mega-dalton-sized RNP that contains RNPS1 but lacks CASC3. Sometime before or during translation, the EJC undergoes compositional and structural remodeling into an SR-devoid monomeric complex that contains CASC3. Surprisingly, RNPS1 is important for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in general, whereas CASC3 is needed for NMD of only select mRNAs. The switch to CASC3-EJC slows down NMD. Overall, the EJC compositional switch dramatically alters mRNP structure and specifies two distinct phases of EJC-dependent NMD.

Abstract: Summary
The bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) protein BRD4 is emerging as a promising anticancer therapeutic target. However, resistance to BET inhibitors often occurs, and it has been linked to aberrant degradation of BRD4 protein in cancer. Here, we demonstrate that the deubiquitinase DUB3 binds to BRD4 and promotes its deubiquitination and stabilization. Expression of DUB3 is transcriptionally repressed by the NCOR2-HDAC10 complex. The NCOR2 gene is frequently deleted in castration-resistant prostate cancer patient specimens, and loss of NCOR2 induces elevation of DUB3 and BRD4 proteins in cancer cells. DUB3-proficient prostate cancer cells are resistant to the BET inhibitor JQ1 in vitro and in mice, but this effect is diminished by DUB3 inhibitory agents such as CDK4/6 inhibitor in a RB-independent manner. Our findings identify a previously unrecognized mechanism causing BRD4 upregulation and drug resistance, suggesting that DUB3 is a viable therapeutic target to overcome BET inhibitor resistance in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), regulate long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, although the sites of BDNF-TrkB receptors in this process are controversial. We used a viral-mediated approach to delete BDNF or TrkB specifically in CA1 and CA3 regions of the Schaffer collateral pathway. Deletion of BDNF in CA3 or CA1 revealed that presynaptic BDNF is involved in LTP induction, while postsynaptic BDNF contributes to LTP maintenance. Similarly, loss of presynaptic or postsynaptic TrkB receptors leads to distinct LTP deficits, with presynaptic TrkB required to maintain LTP, while postsynaptic TrkB is essential for LTP formation. In addition, loss of TrkB in CA3 significantly diminishes release probability, uncovering a role for presynaptic TrkB receptors in basal neurotransmission. Taken together, this direct comparison of presynaptic and postsynaptic BDNF-TrkB reveals insight into BDNF release and TrkB activation sites in hippocampal LTP.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with liver injury and fibrosis, and yet the hepatic factors that regulate ER stress-mediated inflammasome activation remain unknown. Here, we report that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation inhibits ER stress-induced NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in hepatocytes. In patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatic failure or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and in mice with liver injury, FXR levels in the liver inversely correlated with the extent of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Fxr deficiency in mice augmented the ability of ER stress to induce NLRP3 and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), whereas FXR ligand activation prevented it, ameliorating liver injury. FXR attenuates CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)-dependent NLRP3 overexpression by inhibiting ER stress-mediated protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) activation. Our findings implicate miR-186 and its target, non-catalytic region of tyrosine kinase adaptor protein 1 (NCK1), in mediating the inhibition of ER stress by FXR. This study provides the insights on how FXR regulation of ER stress ameliorates hepatocyte death and liver injury and on the molecular basis of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Abstract: Summary
IBD syndromes such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis result from the inflammation of specific intestinal segments. Although many studies have reported on the regenerative response of intestinal progenitor and stem cells to tissue injury, very little is known about the response of differentiated lineages to inflammatory cues. Here, we show that acute inflammation of the mouse small intestine is followed by a dramatic loss of Lgr5+ stem cells. Instead, Paneth cells re-enter the cell cycle, lose their secretory expression signature, and acquire stem-like properties, thus contributing to the tissue regenerative response to inflammation. Stem cell factor secretion upon inflammation triggers signaling through the c-Kit receptor and a cascade of downstream events culminating in GSK3β inhibition and Wnt activation in Paneth cells. Hence, the plasticity of the intestinal epithelium in response to inflammation goes well beyond stem and progenitor cells and extends to the fully differentiated and post-mitotic Paneth cells.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to induction of both inflammatory and interferon-stimulated genes, but the mechanisms through which these coordinately activated transcriptional programs are balanced to promote an optimal innate immune response remain poorly understood. In a genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen of the LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) response in macrophages, we identify the interferon-stimulated protein IFIT1 as a negative regulator of the inflammatory gene program. Transcriptional profiling further identifies a positive regulatory role for IFIT1 in type I interferon expression, implicating IFIT1 as a reciprocal modulator of LPS-induced gene classes. We demonstrate that these effects of IFIT1 are mediated through modulation of a Sin3A-HDAC2 transcriptional regulatory complex at LPS-induced gene loci. Beyond the well-studied role of cytosolic IFIT1 in restricting viral replication, our data demonstrate a function for nuclear IFIT1 in differential transcriptional regulation of separate branches of the LPS-induced gene program.

Abstract: Summary
The pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is defined by its transcriptome and epigenome. The chromatin reader Brd4 determines ESC identity. Although Brd4 regulation in gene transcription has been well described, its contribution to the chromatin landscape is less known. Here, we show that Brd4’s bromodomains partner with the histone acetyltransferase P300, increasing its enzymatic activities. Augmenting histone acetylation by Brd4-P300 interaction recruits the chromatin remodeler Brg1 altering chromatin structure. This pathway is important for maintaining the expression and chromatin patterns of pluripotency-associated genes, such as Oct4, Nanog, and the X chromosome regulatory long noncoding RNAs Tsix and Xite. Furthermore, we show that the Brd4-P300 interaction regulates the de novo formation of chromatin marks during ESC differentiation, as exemplified by controlling the master regulators of mesoderm formation. Collectively, we delineate the function of Brd4 in organizing the chromatin structure that contributes to gene transcriptional regulation and cell fate determination.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple brain regions respond to harmful nociceptive stimuli. However, it remains unclear as to whether behavioral avoidance of such stimuli can be modulated within the same or distinct brain networks. Here, we found subgroups of neurons localized within a well-defined brain region capable of mediating both innate and conditioned nociceptive avoidance in Drosophila. Neurons in the ventral, but not the dorsal, of the multiple-layer organized fan-shaped body (FB) are responsive to electric shock (ES). Silencing ES-responsive neurons, but not non-responsive neurons, leads to reduced avoidance of harmful stimuli, including ES and heat shock. Activating these neurons consistently triggers avoidance and can serve as an unconditional stimulus in an aversive classical conditioning task. Among the three groups of responsive neurons identified, two also have reduced activity in ES-conditioned odor avoidance. These results demonstrate that both innate and conditioned nociceptive avoidance might be represented within neurons confined to a single brain region.

Abstract: Summary
The major objective of this study was to understand the molecular basis of how sarcolipin uncoupling of SERCA regulates muscle oxidative metabolism. Using genetically engineered sarcolipin (SLN) mouse models and primary muscle cells, we demonstrate that SLN plays a crucial role in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in muscle. Loss of SLN severely compromised muscle oxidative capacity without affecting fiber-type composition. Mice overexpressing SLN in fast-twitch glycolytic muscle reprogrammed mitochondrial phenotype, increasing fat utilization and protecting against high-fat diet-induced lipotoxicity. We show that SLN affects cytosolic Ca2+ transients and activates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) and PGC1α axis to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. These studies provide a fundamental framework for understanding the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-Ca2+ cycling as an important factor in mitochondrial health and muscle metabolism. We propose that SLN can be targeted to enhance energy expenditure in muscle and prevent metabolic disease.
