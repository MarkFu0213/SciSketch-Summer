Abstract: Summary
Earlier work demonstrated that the transcription factor C/EBPα can convert immature and mature murine B lineage cells into functional macrophages. Testing >20 human lymphoma and leukemia B cell lines, we found that most can be transdifferentiated at least partially into macrophage-like cells, provided that C/EBPα is expressed at sufficiently high levels. A tamoxifen-inducible subclone of the Seraphina Burkitt lymphoma line, expressing C/EBPαER, could be efficiently converted into phagocytic and quiescent cells with a transcriptome resembling normal macrophages. The converted cells retained their phenotype even when C/EBPα was inactivated, a hallmark of cell reprogramming. Interestingly, C/EBPα induction also impaired the cells’ tumorigenicity. Likewise, C/EBPα efficiently converted a lymphoblastic leukemia B cell line into macrophage-like cells, again dramatically impairing their tumorigenicity. Our experiments show that human cancer cells can be induced by C/EBPα to transdifferentiate into seemingly normal cells at high frequencies and provide a proof of principle for a potential new therapeutic strategy for treating B cell malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Hormone-gated nuclear receptors (NRs) are conserved transcriptional regulators of metabolism, reproduction, and homeostasis. Here we show that C. elegans NHR-8 NR, a homolog of vertebrate liver X and vitamin D receptors, regulates nematode cholesterol balance, fatty acid desaturation, apolipoprotein production, and bile acid metabolism. Loss of nhr-8 results in a deficiency in bile acid-like steroids, called the dafachronic acids, which regulate the related DAF-12/NR, thus controlling entry into the long-lived dauer stage through cholesterol availability. Cholesterol supplementation rescues various nhr-8 phenotypes, including developmental arrest, unsaturated fatty acid deficiency, reduced fertility, and shortened life span. Notably, nhr-8 also interacts with daf-16/FOXO to regulate steady-state cholesterol levels and is synthetically lethal in combination with insulin signaling mutants that promote unregulated growth. Our studies provide important insights into nuclear receptor control of cholesterol balance and metabolism and their impact on development, reproduction, and aging in the context of larger endocrine networks.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-to-cell communication coordinates the behavior of individual cells to establish organ patterning and development. Although mobile signals are known to be important in lateral root development, the role of plasmodesmata (PD)-mediated transport in this process has not been investigated. Here, we show that changes in symplastic connectivity accompany and regulate lateral root organogenesis in Arabidopsis. This connectivity is dependent upon callose deposition around PD affecting molecular flux through the channel. Two plasmodesmal-localized β-1,3 glucanases (PdBGs) were identified that regulate callose accumulation and the number and distribution of lateral roots. The fundamental role of PD-associated callose in this process was illustrated by the induction of similar phenotypes in lines with altered callose turnover. Our results show that regulation of callose and cell-to-cell connectivity is critical in determining the pattern of lateral root formation, which influences root architecture and optimal plant performance.

Abstract: Summary
Neuropepetide Y (NPY) is best known for its powerful stimulation of food intake and its effects on reducing energy expenditure. However, the pathways involved and the regulatory mechanisms behind this are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that NPY derived from the arcuate nucleus (Arc) is critical for the control of sympathetic outflow and brown adipose tissue (BAT) function. Mechanistically, a key change induced by Arc NPY signaling is a marked Y1 receptor-mediated reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which is also associated with a reduction in TH expression in the locus coeruleus (LC) and other regions in the brainstem. Consistent with this, Arc NPY signaling decreased sympathetically innervated BAT thermogenesis, involving the downregulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression in BAT. Taken together, these data reveal a powerful Arc-NPY-regulated neuronal circuit that controls BAT thermogenesis and sympathetic output via TH neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Because microRNAs (miRNAs) influence the expression of many genes in cells, discovering how the miRNA pathway is regulated is an important area of investigation. We found that the Drosophila miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) exists in multiple forms. A constitutive form, called G-miRISC, is comprised of Ago1, miRNA, and GW182. Two distinct miRISC complexes that lack GW182 are regulated by mitogenic signaling. Exposure of cells to serum, lipids, or the tumor promoter PMA suppressed formation of these complexes. P-miRISC is comprised of Ago1, miRNA, and Loqs-PB, and it associates with mRNAs assembled into polysomes. The other regulated Ago1 complex associates with membranous organelles and is likely an intermediate in miRISC recycling. The formation of these complexes is correlated with a 5- to 10-fold stronger repression of target gene expression inside cells. Taken together, these results indicate that mitogenic signaling regulates the miRNA effector machinery to attenuate its repressive activities.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1 accessory protein Vif hijacks a cellular Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase, CRL5, to promote degradation of the APOBEC3 (A3) family of restriction factors. Recently, the cellular transcription cofactor CBFβ was shown to form a complex with CRL5-Vif and to be essential for A3 degradation and viral infectivity. We now demonstrate that CBFβ is required for assembling a well-ordered CRL5-Vif complex by inhibiting Vif oligomerization and by activating CRL5-Vif via direct interaction. The CRL5-Vif-CBFβ holoenzyme forms a well-defined heterohexamer, indicating that Vif simultaneously hijacks CRL5 and CBFβ. Heterodimers of CBFβ and RUNX transcription factors contribute toward the regulation of genes, including those with immune system functions. We show that binding of Vif to CBFβ is mutually exclusive with RUNX heterodimerization and impacts the expression of genes whose regulatory domains are associated with RUNX1. Our results provide a mechanism by which a pathogen with limited coding capacity uses one factor to hijack multiple host pathways.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression and play crucial roles in many biological processes including apoptosis, differentiation, development, and tumorigenesis. Recent estimates suggest that more than 50% of human protein coding genes may be regulated by miRNAs and that each miRNA may bind to 300-400 target genes. Approximately 1,000 human miRNAs have been identified so far with each having up to hundreds of unique target mRNAs. However, the targets for a majority of these miRNAs have not been identified due to the lack of large-scale experimental detection techniques. Experimental detection of miRNA target sites is a costly and time-consuming process, even though identification of miRNA targets is critical to unraveling their functions in various biological processes. To identify miRNA targets, we developed miRTar Hunter, a novel computational approach for predicting target sites regardless of the presence or absence of a seed match or evolutionary sequence conservation. Our approach is based on a dynamic programming algorithm that incorporates more sequence-specific features and reflects the properties of various types of target sites that determine diverse aspects of complementarities between miRNAs and their targets. We evaluated the performance of our algorithm on 532 known human miRNA:target pairs and 59 experimentally-verified negative miRNA:target pairs, and also compared our method with three popular programs for 481 miRNA:target pairs. miRTar Hunter outperformed three popular existing algorithms in terms of recall and precision, indicating that our unique scheme to quantify the determinants of complementary sites is effective at detecting miRNA targets. miRTar Hunter is now available at http://203.230.194.162/~kbkim.

Abstract: Autonomous tonic firing of the midbrain dopamine neuron is essential for maintenance of ambient dopamine level in the brain, in which intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) plays a complex but pivotal role. However, little is known about Ca2+ signals by which dopamine neurons maintain an optimum spontaneous firing rate. In the midbrain dopamine neurons, we here show that spontaneous firing evoked [Ca2+]c changes in a phasic manner in the dendritic region but a tonic manner in the soma. Tonic levels of somatic [Ca2+]c strictly tallied with spontaneous firing rates. However, manipulatory raising or lowering of [Ca2+]c with caged compounds from the resting firing state proportionally suppressed or raised spontaneous firing rate, respectively, suggesting presence of the homeostatic regulation mechanism for spontaneous firing rate via tonic [Ca2+]c changes of the soma. More importantly, abolition of this homeostatic regulation mechanism significantly exaggerated the responses of tonic firings and high-frequency phasic discharges to glutamate. Therefore, we conclude that this Ca2+-dependent homeostatic regulation mechanism is responsible for not only maintaining optimum rate of spontaneous firing, but also proper responses to glutamate. Perturbation of this mechanism could cause dopamine neurons to be more vulnerable to glutamate and Ca2+ toxicities.

Abstract: It is well established that reduction of Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (L-type VDCC), or increase of cytosolic cAMP concentration ([cAMP]c), inhibit contractile activity of smooth muscles in response to transmitters released from sympathetic nerves. Surprisingly, in this work we observed that simultaneous administration of L-type VDCC blocker (verapamil) and [cAMP]c enhancers (rolipram, IBMX and forskolin) potentiated purinergic contractions evoked by electrical field stimulation of rat vas deferens, instead of inhibiting them. These results, including its role in sympathetic transmission, can be considered as a “calcium paradox”. On the other hand, this potentiation was prevented by reduction of [cAMP]c by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (SQ 22536) or depletion of Ca2+ storage of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum by blockade of Ca2+ reuptake (thapsigargin). In addition, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) evaluated by fluorescence microscopy in rat adrenal medullary slices was significantly reduced by verapamil or rolipram. In contrast, simultaneous incubation of adrenal slices with these compounds significantly increased [Ca2+]c. This effect was prevented by thapsigargin. Thus, a reduction of [Ca2+]c due to blockade of Ca2+ influx through L-type VDCC could stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity increasing [cAMP]c thereby stimulating Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in augmented transmitter release in sympathetic nerves and contraction.

Abstract: Summary
B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway components represent promising treatment targets in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and additional B cell tumors. BCR signaling activates spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and downstream pathways including PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In previous studies, chemical SYK blockade selectively decreased BCR signaling and induced apoptosis of BCR-dependent DLBCLs. Herein, we characterize distinct SYK/PI3K-dependent survival pathways in DLBCLs with high or low baseline NF-κB activity including selective repression of the pro-apoptotic HRK protein in NF-κB-low tumors. We also define SYK/PI3K-dependent cholesterol biosynthesis as a feed-forward mechanism of maintaining the integrity of BCRs in lipid rafts in DLBCLs with low or high NF-κB. In addition, SYK amplification and PTEN deletion are identified as selective genetic alterations in primary “BCR”-type DLBCLs.

Abstract: Spermatogenesis in Lake Magadi tilapia (Alcolapia grahami), a cichlid fish endemic to the highly alkaline and saline Lake Magadi in Kenya, was evaluated using light and transmission electron microscopy. Spermatogenesis, typified by its three major phases (spermatocytogenesis, meiosis and spermiogenesis), was demonstrated by the presence of maturational spermatogenic cells namely spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa. Primary spermatogonia, the largest of all the germ cells, underwent a series of mitotic divisions producing primary spermatocytes, which then entered two consecutive meiotic divisions to produce secondary spermatocytes and spermatids. Spermatids, in turn, passed through three structurally distinct developmental stages typical of type-I spermiogenesis to yield typical primitive anacrosomal spermatozoa of the externally fertilizing type (aquasperm). The spermatozoon of this fish exhibited a spheroidal head with the nucleus containing highly electron-dense chromatin globules, a midpiece containing ten ovoid mitochondria arranged in two rows and a flagellum formed by the typical 9+2 microtubule axoneme. In addition, the midpiece, with no cytoplasmic sheath, appeared to end blindly distally in a lobe-like pattern around the flagellum; a feature that was unique and considered adaptive for the spermatozoon of this species to the harsh external environment. These observations show that the testis of A. grahami often undergoes active spermatogenesis despite the harsh environmental conditions to which it is exposed on a daily basis within the lake. Further, the spermiogenic features and spermatozoal ultrastructure appear to be characteristic of Cichlidae and, therefore, may be of phylogenetic significance.

Competition between Pre-mRNAs for the Splicing Machinery Drives Global Regulation of Splicing,

Abstract: Summary
During meiosis in yeast, global splicing efficiency increases and then decreases. Here we provide evidence that splicing improves due to reduced competition for the splicing machinery. The timing of this regulation corresponds to repression and reactivation of ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) during meiosis. In vegetative cells, RPG repression by rapamycin treatment also increases splicing efficiency. Downregulation of the RPG-dedicated transcription factor gene IFH1 genetically suppresses two spliceosome mutations, prp11-1 and prp4-1, and globally restores splicing efficiency in prp4-1 cells. We conclude that the splicing apparatus is limiting and that pre-messenger RNAs compete. Splicing efficiency of a pre-mRNA therefore depends not just on its own concentration and affinity for limiting splicing factor(s), but also on those of competing pre-mRNAs. Competition between RNAs for limiting processing factors appears to be a general condition in eukaryotes for a variety of posttranscriptional control mechanisms including microRNA (miRNA) repression, polyadenylation, and splicing.

Abstract: Summary
Paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors frequently associated with mutations in RET, NF1, VHL, and succinate dehydrogenase (SDHx) genes. Methylome analysis of a large paraganglioma cohort identified three stable clusters, associated with distinct clinical features and mutational status. SDHx-related tumors displayed a hypermethylator phenotype, associated with downregulation of key genes involved in neuroendocrine differentiation. Succinate accumulation in SDH-deficient mouse chromaffin cells led to DNA hypermethylation by inhibition of 2-OG-dependent histone and DNA demethylases and established a migratory phenotype reversed by decitabine treatment. Epigenetic silencing was particularly severe in SDHB-mutated tumors, potentially explaining their malignancy. Finally, inactivating FH mutations were identified in the only hypermethylated tumor without SDHx mutations. These findings emphasize the interplay between the Krebs cycle, epigenomic changes, and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-specific differentiation programs become dysregulated during cancer evolution. The transcription factor Nkx2-1 is a master regulator of pulmonary differentiation that is downregulated in poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma. Here we use conditional murine genetics to determine how the identity of lung epithelial cells changes upon loss of their master cell-fate regulator. Nkx2-1 deletion in normal and neoplastic lungs causes not only loss of pulmonary identity but also conversion to a gastric lineage. Nkx2-1 is likely to maintain pulmonary identity by recruiting transcription factors Foxa1 and Foxa2 to lung-specific loci, thus preventing them from binding gastrointestinal targets. Nkx2-1-negative murine lung tumors mimic mucinous human lung adenocarcinomas, which express gastric markers. Loss of the gastrointestinal transcription factor Hnf4α leads to derepression of the embryonal proto-oncogene Hmga2 in Nkx2-1-negative tumors. These observations suggest that loss of both active and latent differentiation programs is required for tumors to reach a primitive, poorly differentiated state.

Abstract: Nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs) regulate the higher-order organization of chromatin and affect the expression of their flanking genes. In this study, a tobacco MAR, TM6, was isolated and demonstrated to remarkably increase the expression of four different promoters that drive gusA gene and adjacent nptII gene. In turn, this expression enhanced the transformation frequency of transgenic tobacco. Deletion analysis of topoisomerase II- binding site, AT-rich element, and MAR recognition signature (MRS) showed that MRS has the highest contribution (61.7%) to the TM6 sequence-mediated transcription activation. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) accessibility assay showed that 35S and NOS promoter regions with TM6 are more sensitive than those without TM6. The analysis also revealed that TM6 reduces promoter DNA methylation which can affect the gusA expression. In addition, two tobacco chromatin-associated proteins, NtMBP1 and NtHMGB, isolated using a yeast one-hybrid system, specifically bound to the TM6II-1 region (761 bp to 870 bp) and to the MRS element in the TM6II-2 (934 bp to 1,021 bp) region, respectively. We thus suggested that TM6 mediated its chromatin opening and chromatin accessibility of its flanking promoters with consequent enhancement of transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of Wnt signaling is closely associated with human liver tumorigenesis. However, liver cancer-specific Wnt transcriptional programs and downstream effectors remain poorly understood. Here, we identify tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) as a direct target of Wnt/TCF in liver cancer and demonstrate that transcription of Wnt target genes, including TRIB2, is coordinated by the TCF and FoxA transcription factors in liver cancer cells. We show that Wnt-TRIB2 activation is critical for cancer cell survival and transformation. Mechanistically, TRIB2 promotes protein stabilization of the YAP transcription coactivator through interaction with the βTrCP ubiquitin ligase. Furthermore, we find that TRIB2 relieves the liver tumor suppressor protein C/EBPα-mediated inhibition of YAP/TEAD transcriptional activation in liver cancer cells. Altogether, our study uncovers a regulatory mechanism underlying liver cancer-specific Wnt transcriptional output, and suggests that TRIB2 functions as a signaling nexus to integrate the Wnt/β-catenin, Hippo/YAP, and C/EBPα pathways in cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells have antitumor, antiviral, and antibacterial functions, and efforts are being made to manipulate them in immunotherapeutic approaches. However, their activation mechanisms remain poorly defined, particularly during bacterial infections. Here, we show that upon lipopolysaccharide or E. coli exposure, dendritic cells (DCs) produce three cytokines—interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-18, and interferon β (IFN-β)—necessary and sufficient for NK cell activation. IFN-β enhances NK cell activation by inducing IL-15 and IL-15 receptor α not only in DCs but, surprisingly, also in NK cells. This process allows the transfer of IL-15 on NK cell surface and its cis presentation. cis-presented NK cell-derived and trans-presented DC-derived IL-15 contribute equally to optimal NK cell activation.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription has been linked to DNA damage. How the most highly transcribed mammalian ribosomal (rDNA) genes maintain genome integrity in the absence of transcription-coupled DNA damage repair is poorly understood. Here, we report that ABH2/ALKBH2, a DNA alkylation repair enzyme, is highly enriched in the nucleolus. ABH2 interacts with DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80 as well as nucleolar proteins nucleolin, nucleophosmin 1, and upstream binding factor (UBF). ABH2 associates with and promotes rDNA transcription through its DNA repair activity. ABH2 knockdown impairs rDNA transcription and leads to increased single-stranded and double-stranded DNA breaks that are more pronounced in the rDNA genes, whereas ABH2 overexpression protects cells from methyl-methanesulfonate-induced DNA damage and inhibition of rDNA transcription. In response to massive alkylation damage, ABH2 rapidly redistributes from the nucleolus to nucleoplasm. Our study thus reveals a critical role of ABH2 in maintaining rDNA gene integrity and transcription and provides insight into the ABH2 DNA repair function.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomes are specialized entities that participate in regulation of gene expression through their rRNAs carrying ribozyme activity. Ribosome biogenesis is overactivated in p53-inactivated cancer cells, although involvement of p53 on ribosome quality is unknown. Here, we show that p53 represses expression of the rRNA methyl-transferase fibrillarin (FBL) by binding directly to FBL. High levels of FBL are accompanied by modifications of the rRNA methylation pattern, impairment of translational fidelity, and an increase of internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation initiation of key cancer genes. FBL overexpression contributes to tumorigenesis and is associated with poor survival in patients with breast cancer. Thus, p53 acts as a safeguard of protein synthesis by regulating FBL and the subsequent quality and intrinsic activity of ribosomes.

Abstract: Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) are a potential cell source for autologous cell therapy due to their regenerative ability. However, detailed cytological or phenotypic characteristics of these cells are still unclear. Therefore, we determined and compared cell size, morphology, ultrastructure, and immunohistochemical (IHC) expression profiles of isolated hADMSCs and cells located in human adipose tissues. We also characterized the localization of these cells in vivo. Light microscopy examination at low power revealed that hADMSCs acquired a spindle-shaped morphology after four passages. Additionally, high power views showed that these cells had various sizes, nuclear contours, and cytoplasmic textures. To further evaluate cell morphology, transmission electron microscopy was performed. hADMSCs typically had ultrastructural characteristics similar to those of primitive mesenchymal cells including a relatively high nuclear/cytosol ratio, prominent nucleoli, immature cytoplasmic organelles, and numerous filipodia. Some cells contained various numbers of lamellar bodies and lipid droplets. IHC staining demonstrated that PDGFR and CD10 were constitutively expressed in most hADMSCs regardless of passage number but expression levels of α-SMA, CD68, Oct4 and c-kit varied. IHC staining of adipose tissue showed that cells with immunophenotypic characteristics identical to those of hADMSCs were located mainly in the perivascular adventitia not in smooth muscle area. In summary, hADMSCs were found to represent a heterogeneous cell population with primitive mesenchymal cells that were mainly found in the perivascular adventitia. Furthermore, the cell surface markers would be CD10/PDGFR. To obtain defined cell populations for therapeutic purposes, further studies will be required to establish more specific isolation methods.

Abstract: Protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (ΡΤΡσ) plays a vital role in neural development. The extracellular domain of ΡΤΡσ binds to various proteoglycans, which control the activity of 2 intracellular PTP domains (D1 and D2). To understand the regulatory mechanism of PTPσ, we carried out structural and biochemical analyses of PTPσ D1D2. In the crystal structure analysis of a mutant form of D1D2 of PTPσ, we unexpectedly found that the catalytic cysteine of D1 is oxidized to cysteine sulfenic acid, while that of D2 remained in its reduced form, suggesting that D1 is more sensitive to oxidation than D2. This finding contrasts previous observations on PTPα. The cysteine sulfenic acid of D1 was further confirmed by immunoblot and mass spectrometric analyses. The stabilization of the cysteine sulfenic acid in the active site of PTP suggests that the formation of cysteine sulfenic acid may function as a stable intermediate during the redox-regulation of PTPs.

Abstract: Summary
The 3′ ends of most eukaryotic mRNAs are produced by an endonucleolytic cleavage followed by synthesis of a poly(A) tail. Poly(A) polymerase (PAP), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the tail, is subject to tight regulation involving several posttranslational modifications. Here we show that the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) modifies PAP and regulates its activity both in vitro and in vivo. PARP1 binds to and modifies PAP by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) in vitro, which inhibits PAP activity. In vivo we show that PAP is PARylated during heat shock, leading to inhibition of polyadenylation in a PARP1-dependent manner. The observed inhibition reflects reduced RNA binding affinity of PARylated PAP in vitro and decreased PAP association with non-heat shock protein-encoding genes in vivo. Our results provide direct evidence that PARylation can control processing of mRNA precursors, and also identify PARP1 as a regulator of polyadenylation during thermal stress.

Abstract: Summary
Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed through the activity of the spliceosome, a dynamic enzymatic complex. Forcing aberrant interactions within the spliceosome can reduce splicing efficiency and alter splice site choice; however, it is unknown whether such alterations are naturally exploited mechanisms of splicing regulation. Here, we demonstrate that hnRNP L represses CD45 exon 4 by recruiting hnRNP A1 to a sequence upstream of the 5′ splice site. Together, hnRNP L and A1 induce extended contacts between the 5′ splice site-bound U1 snRNA and neighboring exonic sequences that, in turn, inhibit stable association of U6 snRNA and subsequent catalysis. Importantly, analysis of several exons regulated by hnRNP L shows a clear relationship between the potential for binding of hnRNP A1 and U1 snRNA and the effect of hnRNP L on splicing. Together, our results demonstrate that conformational perturbations within the spliceosome are a naturally occurring and generalizable mechanism for controlling alternative splicing decisions.

Abstract: Summary
Lipids play critical roles in energy homeostasis, membrane structure, and signaling. Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, we provide a comprehensive semiquantification of lipids during the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster (230 glycerophospholipids, 210 sphingolipids, 6 sterols and sterol esters, and 60 glycerolipids) and obtain biological insights through this biochemical resource. First, we find a high and constant triacylglycerol-to-membrane lipid ratio during pupal stage, which is nonobvious in the absence of nutrient uptake and tissue remodeling. Second, sphingolipids undergo specific changes in headgroup (glycosylation) and tail configurations (unsaturation and hydroxylation on sphingoid base and fatty acyls, respectively), which correlate with gene expression of known (GlcT/CG6437; FA2H/ CG30502) and putative (Cyt-b5-r/CG13279) enzymes. Third, we identify a gender bias in phosphoethanolamine-ceramides as a lead for future investigation into sexual maturation. Finally, we partially characterize ghiberti, required for male meiotic cytokinesis, as a homolog of mammalian serine palmitoyltransferase.

Abstract: Summary
The Plk1-interacting checkpoint helicase (PICH) protein localizes to ultrafine anaphase bridges (UFBs) in mitosis alongside a complex of DNA repair proteins, including the Bloom’s syndrome protein (BLM). However, very little is known about the function of PICH or how it is recruited to UFBs. Using a combination of microfluidics, fluorescence microscopy, and optical tweezers, we have defined the properties of PICH in an in vitro model of an anaphase bridge. We show that PICH binds with a remarkably high affinity to duplex DNA, resulting in ATP-dependent protein translocation and extension of the DNA. Most strikingly, the affinity of PICH for binding DNA increases with tension-induced DNA stretching, which mimics the effect of the mitotic spindle on a UFB. PICH binding also appears to diminish force-induced DNA melting. We propose a model in which PICH recognizes and stabilizes DNA under tension during anaphase, thereby facilitating the resolution of entangled sister chromatids.

Abstract: Summary
Melanocytes are pigment-producing cells of neural crest (NC) origin that are responsible for protecting the skin against UV irradiation. Pluripotent stem cell (PSC) technology offers a promising approach for studying human melanocyte development and disease. Here, we report that timed exposure to activators of WNT, BMP, and EDN3 signaling triggers the sequential induction of NC and melanocyte precursor fates under dual-SMAD-inhibition conditions. Using a SOX10::GFP human embryonic stem cell (hESC) reporter line, we demonstrate that the temporal onset of WNT activation is particularly critical for human NC induction. Subsequent maturation of hESC-derived melanocytes yields pure populations that match the molecular and functional properties of adult melanocytes. Melanocytes from Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and Chediak-Higashi syndrome patient-specific induced PSCs (iPSCs) faithfully reproduce the ultrastructural features of disease-associated pigmentation defects. Our data define a highly specific requirement for WNT signaling during NC induction and enable the generation of pure populations of human iPSC-derived melanocytes for faithful modeling of pigmentation disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Despite extensive study, few therapeutic targets have been identified for glioblastoma (GBM). Here we show that patient-derived glioma sphere cultures (GSCs) that resemble either the proneural (PN) or mesenchymal (MES) transcriptomal subtypes differ significantly in their biological characteristics. Moreover, we found that a subset of the PN GSCs undergoes differentiation to a MES state in a TNF-α/NF-κB-dependent manner with an associated enrichment of CD44 subpopulations and radioresistant phenotypes. We present data to suggest that the tumor microenvironment cell types such as macrophages/microglia may play an integral role in this process. We further show that the MES signature, CD44 expression, and NF-κB activation correlate with poor radiation response and shorter survival in patients with GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the hedgehog pathway drive the formation of tumors in many different organs, including the development of basal cell carcinoma in the skin. However, little is known about the role of epidermal Indian hedgehog (Ihh) in skin physiology. Using mouse genetics, we identified overlapping and distinct functions of Ihh in different models of epidermal tumorigenesis. Epidermal deletion of Ihh resulted in increased formation of benign squamous papilloma. Strikingly, Ihh-deficient mice showed an increase in malignant squamous cell carcinoma and developed lung and lymph node metastases. In a sebaceous gland tumor model, Ihh deficiency inhibited tumor cell differentiation. More mechanistically, IHH stimulated cell proliferation by activating the transcription factor GLI2 in human keratinocytes and human tumors. Thus, our results uncover important functions for Ihh signaling in controlling proliferation, differentiation, malignant progression, and metastasis of epithelial cancer, establishing Ihh as a gatekeeper for controlling the grade of tumor malignancy.

Abstract: Summary
What are the molecular properties of proteins that fall on the radar of protein quality control (PQC)? Here we mutate the E. coli’s gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and replace it with bacterial orthologous genes to determine how components of PQC modulate fitness effects of these genetic changes. We find that chaperonins GroEL/ES and protease Lon compete for binding to molten globule intermediate of DHFR, resulting in a peculiar symmetry in their action: overexpression of GroEL/ES and deletion of Lon both restore growth of deleterious DHFR mutants and most of the slow-growing orthologous DHFR strains. Kinetic steady-state modeling predicts and experimentation verifies that mutations affect fitness by shifting the flux balance in cellular milieu between protein production, folding, and degradation orchestrated by PQC through the interaction with folding intermediates.

Abstract: Bax Inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is an evolutionarily conserved six-transmembrane domain endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized protein that protects against ER stress-induced apoptotic cell death. This function is closely connected to its ability to lower steady-state ER Ca2+ levels. Recently, we elucidated BI-1's Ca2+-channel pore in the C-terminal part of the protein and identified the critical amino acids of its pore. Based on these insights, a Ca2+-channel pore-dead mutant BI-1 (BI-1D213R) was developed. We determined whether BI-1 behaves as a bona fide H+/Ca2+ antiporter or as an ER Ca2+-leak channel by investigating the effect of pH on unidirectional Ca2+-efflux rates. At pH 6.8, wild-type BI-1 expression in BI-1−/− cells increased the ER Ca2+-leak rate, correlating with its localization in the ER compartment. In contrast, BI-1D231R expression in BI-1−/−, despite its ER localization, did not increase the ER Ca2+-leak rate. However, at pH<6.8, the BI-1-mediated ER Ca2+ leak was blocked. Finally, a peptide representing the Ca2+-channel pore of BI-1 promoting Ca2+ flux from the ER was used. Lowering the pH from 6.8 to 6.0 completely abolished the ability of the BI-1 peptide to mediate Ca2+ flux from the ER. We propose that this pH dependence is due to two aspartic acid residues critical for the function of the Ca2+-channel pore and located in the ER membrane-dipping domain, which facilitates the protonation of these residues.

Abstract: LL-37 is the only cathelicidin produced by human cells. It is secreted by a variety of cell types, including monocyte/macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, keratinocytes and epithelial cells, acting on the extracellular milieu by directly killing bacteria or boosting innate immunity. Here, we show that LL-37 translocates to the nucleus following overwhelming infection, putting in evidence that its role may be even broader, with new potential important implications to cell biology. Future studies are necessary to address if LL-37 is able to induce or affect transcription, since it can lead to a novel cell signaling pathway that probably will contribute to the understanding of complex diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The Keap1-Nrf2 system and autophagy are both involved in the oxidative-stress response, metabolic pathways, and innate immunity, and dysregulation of these processes is associated with pathogenic processes. However, the interplay between these two pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylation of the autophagy-adaptor protein p62 markedly increases p62’s binding affinity for Keap1, an adaptor of the Cul3-ubiquitin E3 ligase complex responsible for degrading Nrf2. Thus, p62 phosphorylation induces expression of cytoprotective Nrf2 targets. p62 is assembled on selective autophagic cargos such as ubiquitinated organelles and subsequently phosphorylated in an mTORC1-dependent manner, implying coupling of the Keap1-Nrf2 system to autophagy. Furthermore, persistent activation of Nrf2 through accumulation of phosphorylated p62 contributes to the growth of human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). These results demonstrate that selective autophagy and the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway are interdependent, and that inhibitors of the interaction between phosphorylated p62 and Keap1 have potential as therapeutic agents against human HCC.

Abstract: There is increasing evidence suggesting that dysregulation of certain microRNAs (miRNAs) may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis. Previous studies have shown that miR-409-3p is dysregulated in some malignancies, but its role in bladder cancer is still unknown. Here, we find that miR-409-3p is down-regulated in human bladder cancer tissues and cell lines. Enforced expression of miR-409-3p in bladder cancer cells significantly reduced their migration and invasion without affecting cell viability. Bioinformatics analysis identified the pro-metastatic gene c-Met as a potential miR-409-3p target. Further studies indicated that miR-409-3p suppressed the expression of c- Met by binding to its 3’-untranslated region. Silencing of c- Met by small interfering RNAs phenocopied the effects of miR-409-3p overexpression, whereas restoration of c-Met in bladder cancer cells bladder cancer cells overexpressing miR-409-3p, partially reversed the suppressive effects of miR-409-3p. We further showed that MMP2 and MMP9 may be downstream effector proteins of miR-409-3p. These findings indicate that miR-409-3p could be a potential tumor suppressor in bladder cancer.

Abstract: During skeletal development, both osteogenic and chondrogenic programs are initiated from multipotent mesenchymal cells, requiring a number of signaling molecules, transcription factors, and downstream effectors to orchestrate the sophisticated process. Col10a1, an important downstream effector gene, has been identified as a marker for maturing chondrocytes in higher vertebrates, such as mammals and birds. In zebrafish, this gene has been shown to be expressed in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes, but no study has reported its role in osteoblast development. To initially delineate the osteogenic program from chondrogenic lineage development, we used the zebrafish col10a1 promoter to establish a transgenic zebrafish expressing a GFP reporter specifically in osteoblast-specific bone structures that do not involve cartilaginous programs. A construct harboring a ~2.2-kb promoter region was found to be sufficient to drive the reporter gene in osteoblast-specific bone structures within the endogenous col10a1 expression domain, confirming that separable cis-acting elements exist for distinct cell type-specific expression of col10a1 during zebrafish skeletal development. The ~2.2-kb col10a1:GFP transgenic zebrafish marking only bone structures derived from osteoblasts will undoubtedly be an invaluable tool for identifying and characterizing molecular events driving osteoblast development in zebrafish, which may further provide a differential mechanism where col10a1 is involved in the development of chondrocytes undergoing maturation in other vertebrate systems.

Abstract: Ginseng, the root of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, is used as a general tonic. Recently, we isolated a novel ginsengderived lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand, gintonin. Gintonin activates G protein-coupled LPA receptors with high affinity in cells endogenously expressing LPA receptors, e.g., Xenopus oocytes. P2X receptors are ligandgated ion channels activated by extracellular ATP, and 7 receptor subtypes (P2X1-P2X7) have been identified. Most of the P2X1 receptors are expressed in the smooth muscles of genitourinary organs involved in reproduction. A main characteristic of the P2X1 receptor is rapid desensitization after repeated ATP treatment of cells or tissues expressing P2X1 receptors. In the present study, we examined the effect of gintonin on P2X1 receptor channel activity. P2X1 receptors were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. ATP treatment of oocytes expressing P2X1 receptors induced large inward currents (IATP), but repetitive ATP treatments induced a rapid desensitization of IATP. Gintonin treatment after P2X1 receptor desensitization potentiated IATP in a concentration-dependent manner. We further examined the signaling transduction pathways involved in gintonin-mediated potentiation of IATP. Gintonin-mediated IATP potentiation was blocked by Ki16425, an LPA1/3 receptor antagonist, a PKC inhibitor, a PLC inibitor, and a PI4-Kinase inhibitor but not by a calcium chelator. In addition, mutations of the phosphoinositide binding site of the P2X1 receptor greatly attenuated the gintonin-mediated IATP potentiation. These results indicate that G protein-coupled LPA receptor activation by gintonin is coupled to the potentiation of the desensitized P2X1 receptor through a phosphoinositide-dependent pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including monoubiquitylation of histone H2B on lysine 120 (H2Bub1), play a major role in regulating genome functions. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of H2Bub1 activity, a chromatin template uniformly containing H2Bub1 was used as an affinity matrix to identify preferentially interacting human proteins. Over 90 such factors were found, including proteins and protein complexes associated with transcription, RNA posttranscriptional modifications, and DNA replication and repair. Notably, we found that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex associates preferentially with H2Bub1-rich chromatin. Moreover, SWI/SNF is required for optimal transcription of a subset of genes that are selectively dependent on H2Bub1. Our findings substantially expand the known H2Bub1 interactome and provide insights into the functions of this PTM in mammalian gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer progresses through distinct stages, and mouse models recapitulating traits of this progression are frequently used to explore genetic, morphological, and pharmacological aspects of tumor development. To complement genomic investigations of this process, we here quantify phosphoproteomic changes in skin cancer development using the SILAC mouse technology coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. We distill protein expression signatures from our data that distinguish between skin cancer stages. A distinct phosphoproteome of the two stages of cancer progression is identified that correlates with perturbed cell growth and implicates cell adhesion as a major driver of malignancy. Importantly, integrated analysis of phosphoproteomic data and prediction of kinase activity revealed PAK4-PKC/SRC network to be highly deregulated in SCC but not in papilloma. This detailed molecular picture, both at the proteome and phosphoproteome level, will prove useful for the study of mechanisms of tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic Argonautes bind small RNAs and use them as guides to find complementary RNA targets and induce gene silencing. Though homologs of eukaryotic Argonautes are present in many bacteria and archaea, their small RNA partners and functions are unknown. We found that the Argonaute of Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RsAgo) associates with 15–19 nt RNAs that correspond to the majority of transcripts. RsAgo also binds single-stranded 22–24 nt DNA molecules that are complementary to the small RNAs and enriched in sequences derived from exogenous plasmids as well as genome-encoded foreign nucleic acids such as transposons and phage genes. Expression of RsAgo in the heterologous E. coli system leads to formation of plasmid-derived small RNA and DNA and plasmid degradation. In a R. sphaeroides mutant lacking RsAgo, expression of plasmid-encoded genes is elevated. Our results indicate that RNAi-related processes found in eukaryotes are also conserved in bacteria and target foreign nucleic acids.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays an important role in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. When Wnt ligands bind to the receptor complex, LRP5/6 coreceptors are activated by phosphorylation and concomitantly endocytosed. In vertebrates, Wnt ligands induce caveolin-dependent endocytosis of LRP6 to relay signal downstream, whereas antagonists such as Dickkopf promote clathrin-dependent endocytosis, leading to inhibition. However, little is known about how LRP6 is directed to different internalization mechanisms, and how caveolin-dependent endocytosis is mediated. In an RNAi screen, we identified the Rab GTPase RAB8B as being required for Wnt/β-catenin signaling. RAB8B depletion reduces LRP6 activity, β-catenin accumulation, and induction of Wnt target genes, whereas RAB8B overexpression promotes LRP6 activity and internalization and rescues inhibition of caveolar endocytosis. In Xenopus laevis and Danio rerio, RAB8B morphants show lower Wnt activity during embryonic development. Our results implicate RAB8B as an essential evolutionary conserved component of Wnt/β-catenin signaling through regulation of LRP6 activity and endocytosis.

Opposing Effect of EGFRWT on EGFRvIII-Mediated NF-κB Activation with RIP1 as a Cell Death Switch,

Abstract: Summary
RIP1 is a central mediator of cell death in response to cell stress but can also mediate cell survival by activating NF-κB. Here, we show that RIP1 acts as a switch in EGFR signaling. EGFRvIII is an oncogenic mutant that does not bind ligand and is coexpressed with EGFRWT in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). EGFRvIII recruits ubiquitin ligases to RIP1, resulting in K63-linked ubiquitination of RIP1. RIP1 binds to TAK1 and NEMO, forming an EGFRvIII-RIP1 signalosome that activates NF-κB. RIP1 is essential for EGFRvIII-mediated oncogenicity and correlates with NF-κB activation in GBM. Surprisingly, activation of EGFRWT with EGF results in a negative regulation of EGFRvIII, with dissociation of the EGFRvIII-RIP1 signalosome, loss of RIP1 ubiquitination and NF-κB activation, and association of RIP1 with FADD and caspase-8. If EGFRWT is overexpressed with EGFRvIII, the addition of EGF leads to a RIP1 kinase-dependent cell death. The EGFRWT-EGFRvIII-RIP1 interplay may regulate oncogenicity and vulnerability to targeted treatment in GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is a GTP-binding protein/acyltransferase whose expression is upregulated in glioblastoma and associated with decreased patient survival. Here, we delineate a unique mechanism by which tTG contributes to the development of gliomas by using two glioblastoma cell lines, U87 and LN229, whose growth and survival are dependent on tTG. We show that tTG significantly enhances the signaling activity and lifespan of EGF receptors (EGFRs) in these brain cancer cells. Moreover, overexpressing tTG in T98G glioblastoma cells that normally express low levels of tTG caused a marked upregulation of EGFR expression and transforming activity. Furthermore, we show that tTG accentuates EGFR signaling by blocking c-Cbl-catalyzed EGFR ubiquitylation through the ability of tTG to bind GTP and adopt a specific conformation that enables it to interact with c-Cbl. These findings demonstrate that tTG contributes to gliomagenesis by interfering with EGFR downregulation and, thereby, promoting transformation.

Abstract: Summary
We describe the use of a unique DNA-modification-dependent restriction endonuclease AbaSI coupled with sequencing (Aba-seq) to map high-resolution hydroxymethylome of mouse E14 embryonic stem cells. The specificity of AbaSI enables sensitive detection of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at low-occupancy regions. Bioinformatic analysis suggests 5hmCs in genic regions closely follow the 5mC distribution. 5hmC is generally depleted in CpG islands and only enriched in a small set of repetitive elements. A regularly spaced and oscillating 5hmC pattern was observed at the binding sites of CTCF. 5hmC is enriched at the poised enhancers with the monomethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) marks, but not at the active enhancers with the acetylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27Ac) marks. Non-CG hydroxymethylation appears to be prevalent in the mitochondrial genome. We propose that some amounts of transiently stable 5hmCs may indicate a poised epigenetic state or demethylation intermediate, whereas others may suggest a locally accessible chromosomal environment for the TET enzymatic apparatus.

Wnt5a Directs Polarized Calcium Gradients by Recruiting Cortical Endoplasmic Reticulum to the Cell Trailing Edge,

Abstract: Summary
Wnt5a directs the assembly of the Wnt-receptor-actin-myosin-polarity (WRAMP) structure, which integrates cell-adhesion receptors with F-actin and myosin to form a microfilament array associated with multivesicular bodies (MVBs). The WRAMP structure is polarized to the cell posterior, where it directs tail-end membrane retraction, driving forward translocation of the cell body. Here we define constituents of the WRAMP proteome, including regulators of microfilament and microtubule dynamics, protein interactions, and enzymatic activity. IQGAP1, a scaffold for F-actin nucleation and crosslinking, is necessary for WRAMP structure formation, potentially bridging microfilaments and MVBs. Vesicle coat proteins, including coatomer-I subunits, localize to and are required for the WRAMP structure. Electron microscopy and live imaging demonstrate movement of the ER to the WRAMP structure and plasma membrane, followed by elevation of intracellular Ca2+. Thus, Wnt5a controls directional movement by recruiting cortical ER to mobilize a rear-directed, localized Ca2+ signal, activating actomyosin contraction and adhesion disassembly for membrane retraction.

Abstract: Intracellular Ca2+ imaging has widely been used to visualize intracellular signals, but the application in an intact animal is still limited due to difficulty of the indicator loading. In addition, the motion of the living animal produces artifacts. To investigate Ca2+ signaling at early embryonic stage, we established transgenic zebrafish line expressing a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator, cameleon YC2.60, driven by a constitutively active promoter, hspa8. Although the embryo dynamically changes its morphology, the motion artifact could be canceled out by taking the advantage of YC2.60 as a ratiometric indicator. The transgenic zebrafish was used to visualize the propagation of cytosolic Ca2+ during the early embryonic stage upon fertilization and along cleavage furrow, and the rise in Ca2+ in the myocytes contracting spontaneously in the embryo. We also established a transgenic zebrafish line expressing YC2.60 targeted to the mitochondria. The rise in mitochondrial Ca2+ was rather sustained (≈2min), which is consistent with the requirement of ATP refilling since the mitochondrial Ca2+ upregulates rate-limiting enzymes of Krebs cycle. This is in contrast with the transient rise in the cytosol Ca2+ that directly evokes the muscle contraction. These transgenic zebrafish lines are expected to serve as useful tools further Ca2+ imaging in vivo.

Oscillation and Polarity of E-Cadherin Asymmetries Control Actomyosin Flow Patterns during Morphogenesis,

Abstract: Summary
Actomyosin flows are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell migration, polarization, and morphogenesis. In epithelia, flow polarization orients cell deformations. It is unclear, however, how flows are polarized and how global patterns of junction remodeling emerge from flow polarization locally. We address this question during intercalation-driving extension of the Drosophila germband. Intercalation is associated with polarized junction remodeling, whereby actomyosin pulses flow anisotropically toward dorsal-ventral junctions and shrink them. Here, we show that planar polarization of flows emerges from polarized fluctuations in the levels of E-cadherin clusters that produce transient and oscillating asymmetries of coupling. These fluctuations are triggered by polarized E-cadherin endocytosis and are amplified by flow itself. This work suggests that fluctuations and mechanical instability are not the consequences of limited control over the systems key parameters, but rather that they define the axis of symmetry breaking.

Abstract: Summary
Recently, we reported that two homologous yeast proteins, Rai1 and Dxo1, function in a quality control mechanism to clear cells of incompletely 5′ end-capped messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Here, we report that their mammalian homolog, Dom3Z (referred to as DXO), possesses pyrophosphohydrolase, decapping, and 5′-to-3′ exoribonuclease activities. Surprisingly, we found that DXO preferentially degrades defectively capped pre-mRNAs in cells. Additional studies show that incompletely capped pre-mRNAs are inefficiently spliced at all introns, a fact that contrasts with current understanding, and are also poorly cleaved for polyadenylation. Crystal structures of DXO in complex with substrate mimic and products at a resolution of up to 1.5Å provide elegant insights into the catalytic mechanism and molecular basis for their three apparently distinct activities. Our data reveal a pre-mRNA 5′ end capping quality control mechanism in mammalian cells, indicating DXO as the central player for this mechanism, and demonstrate an unexpected intimate link between proper 5′ end capping and subsequent pre-mRNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of 55–200 CGG repeats in the 5′ UTR of FMR1. These expanded CGG repeats are transcribed and accumulate in nuclear RNA aggregates that sequester one or more RNA-binding proteins, thus impairing their functions. Here, we have identified that the double-stranded RNA-binding protein DGCR8 binds to expanded CGG repeats, resulting in the partial sequestration of DGCR8 and its partner, DROSHA, within CGG RNA aggregates. Consequently, the processing of microRNAs (miRNAs) is reduced, resulting in decreased levels of mature miRNAs in neuronal cells expressing expanded CGG repeats and in brain tissue from patients with FXTAS. Finally, overexpression of DGCR8 rescues the neuronal cell death induced by expression of expanded CGG repeats. These results support a model in which a human neurodegenerative disease originates from the alteration, in trans, of the miRNA-processing machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Replication protein A (RPA) is an essential eukaryotic single-stranded DNA binding protein with a central role in DNA metabolism. RPA directly participates in DNA double-strand break repair by stimulating 5′-3′ end resection by the Sgs1/BLM helicase and Dna2 endonuclease in vitro. Here we investigated the role of RPA in end resection in vivo, using a heat-inducible degron system that allows rapid conditional depletion of RPA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that RPA depletion eliminated both the Sgs1-Dna2- and Exo1-dependent extensive resection pathways and synergized with mre11Δ to prevent end resection. The short single-stranded DNA tails formed in the absence of RPA were unstable due to 3′ strand loss and the formation of fold-back hairpin structures that required resection initiation and Pol32-dependent DNA synthesis. Thus, RPA is required to generate ssDNA, and also to protect ssDNA from degradation and inappropriate annealing that could lead to genome rearrangements.

Abstract: Summary
To provide a lifelong supply of blood cells, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) need to carefully balance both self-renewing cell divisions and quiescence. Although several regulators that control this mechanism have been identified, we demonstrate that the transcription factor PU.1 acts upstream of these regulators. So far, attempts to uncover PU.1’s role in HSC biology have failed because of the technical limitations of complete loss-of-function models. With the use of hypomorphic mice with decreased PU.1 levels specifically in phenotypic HSCs, we found reduced HSC long-term repopulation potential that could be rescued completely by restoring PU.1 levels. PU.1 prevented excessive HSC division and exhaustion by controlling the transcription of multiple cell-cycle regulators. Levels of PU.1 were sustained through autoregulatory PU.1 binding to an upstream enhancer that formed an active looped chromosome architecture in HSCs. These results establish that PU.1 mediates chromosome looping and functions as a master regulator of HSC proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Ciliopathies are a broad class of human disorders with craniofacial dysmorphology as a common feature. Among these is high arched palate, a condition that affects speech and quality of life. Using the ciliopathic Fuz mutant mouse, we find that high arched palate does not, as commonly suggested, arise from midface hypoplasia. Rather, increased neural crest expands the maxillary primordia. In Fuz mutants, this phenotype stems from dysregulated Gli processing, which in turn results in excessive craniofacial Fgf8 gene expression. Accordingly, genetic reduction of Fgf8 ameliorates the maxillary phenotypes. Similar phenotypes result from mutation of oral-facial-digital syndrome 1 (Ofd1), suggesting that aberrant transcription of Fgf8 is a common feature of ciliopathies. High arched palate is also a prevalent feature of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) hyperactivation syndromes. Thus, our findings elucidate the etiology for a common craniofacial anomaly and identify links between two classes of human disease: FGF-hyperactivation syndromes and ciliopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Host cell entry of vaccinia virus, the prototypic poxvirus, involves a membrane fusion event delivering the viral core and two proteinaceous lateral bodies (LBs) into the cytosol. Uncoating of viral cores is poorly characterized, and the composition and function of LBs remains enigmatic. We found that cytosolic cores rapidly dissociated from LBs and expanded in volume, which coincided with reduction of disulfide-bonded core proteins. We identified the abundant phosphoprotein F17, the dual-specificity phosphatase VH1, and the oxidoreductase G4 as bona fide LB components. After reaching the cytosol, F17 was degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner. Proteasome activity, and presumably LB disassembly, was required for the immediate immunomodulatory activity of VH1: dephosphorylation of STAT1 to prevent interferon-γ-mediated antiviral responses. These results reveal a mechanism used by poxviruses to deliver viral enzymes to the host cell cytosol and are likely to facilitate the identification of additional LB-resident viral effectors.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular motors are fundamental to neuronal morphogenesis and function. However, the extent to which molecular motors are involved in higher brain functions remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that mice deficient in the kinesin family motor protein KIF13A (Kif13a−/− mice) exhibit elevated anxiety-related behavioral phenotypes, probably because of a reduction in 5HT1A receptor (5HT1AR) transport. The cell-surface expression level of the 5HT1AR was reduced in KIF13A-knockdown neuroblastoma cells and Kif13a−/− hippocampal neurons. Biochemical analysis showed that the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of KIF13A and an intracellular loop of the 5HT1AR are the interface between the motor and cargo vesicles. A minimotor consisting of the motor and FHA domains is able to transport 5HT1AR-carrying organelles in in vitro reconstitution assays. Collectively, our results suggest a role for this molecular motor in anxiety control.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms that underlie and dictate the different biological outcomes of E2F-1 activity have yet to be elucidated. We describe the residue-specific methylation of E2F-1 by the asymmetric dimethylating protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) and symmetric dimethylating PRMT5 and relate the marks to different functional consequences of E2F-1 activity. Methylation by PRMT1 hinders methylation by PRMT5, which augments E2F-1-dependent apoptosis, whereas PRMT5-dependent methylation favors proliferation by antagonizing methylation by PRMT1. The ability of E2F-1 to prompt apoptosis in DNA damaged cells coincides with enhanced PRMT1 methylation. In contrast, cyclin A binding to E2F-1 impedes PRMT1 methylation and augments PRMT5 methylation, thus ensuring that E2F-1 is locked into its cell-cycle progression mode. The Tudor domain protein p100-TSN reads the symmetric methylation mark, and binding of p100-TSN downregulates E2F-1 apoptotic activity. Our results define an exquisite level of precision in the reader-writer interplay that governs the biological outcome of E2F-1 activity.

Abstract: Calcium imaging has become a routine technique in neuroscience for subcellular to network level investigations. The fast progresses in the development of new indicators and imaging techniques call for dedicated reliable analysis methods. In particular, efficient and quantitative background fluorescence subtraction routines would be beneficial to most of the calcium imaging research field. A background-subtracted fluorescence transients estimation method that does not require any independent background measurement is therefore developed. This method is based on a fluorescence model fitted to single-trial data using a classical nonlinear regression approach. The model includes an appropriate probabilistic description of the acquisition system's noise leading to accurate confidence intervals on all quantities of interest (background fluorescence, normalized background-subtracted fluorescence time course) when background fluorescence is homogeneous. An automatic procedure detecting background inhomogeneities inside the region of interest is also developed and is shown to be efficient on simulated data. The implementation and performances of the proposed method on experimental recordings from the mouse hypothalamus are presented in details. This method, which applies to both single-cell and bulk-stained tissues recordings, should help improving the statistical comparison of fluorescence calcium signals between experiments and studies.

Abstract: Summary
The pharyngeal pouches, which form by budding of the foregut endoderm, are essential for segmentation of the vertebrate face. To date, the cellular mechanism and segmental nature of such budding have remained elusive. Here, we find that Wnt11r and Wnt4a from the head mesoderm and ectoderm, respectively, play distinct roles in the segmental formation of pouches in zebrafish. Time-lapse microscopy, combined with mutant and tissue-specific transgenic experiments, reveal requirements of Wnt signaling in two phases of endodermal epithelial transitions. Initially, Wnt11r and Rac1 destabilize the endodermal epithelium to promote the lateral movement of pouch-forming cells. Next, Wnt4a and Cdc42 signaling induce the rearrangement of maturing pouch cells into bilayers through junctional localization of the Alcama immunoglobulin-domain protein, which functions to restabilize adherens junctions. We propose that this dynamic control of epithelial morphology by Wnt signaling may be a common theme for the budding of organ anlagen from the endoderm.

Curcumin Induces Apoptosis in Human Colorectal Carcinoma (HCT-15) Cells by Regulating Expression of Prp4 and p53,

Abstract: Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the yellow pigment of turmeric, is one of the most commonly used and extensively studied phytochemicals due to its pleiotropic effects in several human cancers. In the current study, the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin was investigated in human colorectal carcinoma HCT-15 cells. Curcumin inhibited HCT-15 cells proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Hoechst 33342 and DCFHDA staining revealed morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis as well as ROS generation in HCT-15 cells treated with 30 and 50 μM curcumin. Over-expression of pre-mRNA processing factor 4B (Prp4B) and p53 mutations have been reported as hallmarks of cancer cells. Western blot analysis revealed that curcumin treatment activated caspase-3 and decreased expression of p53 and Prp4B in a time-dependent manner. Transfection of HCT-15 cells with Prp4B clone perturbed the growth inhibition induced by 30 μM curcumin. Fractionation of cells revealed increased accumulation of Prp4B in the nucleus, following its translocation from the cytoplasm. To further evaluate the underlying mechanism and survival effect of Prp4B, we generated siRNA-Prp4B HCT15 clones. Knockdown of Prp4B with siRNA diminished the protective effects of Prp4B against curcumin-induced apoptosis. These results suggest a possible underlying molecular mechanism in which Prp4B over-expression and activity are closely associated with the survival and regulation of apoptotic events in human colon cancer HCT-15 cells.

Abstract: Summary
Compartmentalization of RNA biosynthetic factors into nuclear bodies (NBs) is a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic cells. How NBs initially assemble and ultimately affect gene expression remains unresolved. The histone locus body (HLB) contains factors necessary for replication-coupled histone messenger RNA transcription and processing and associates with histone gene clusters. Using a transgenic assay for ectopic Drosophila HLB assembly, we show that a sequence located between, and transcription from, the divergently transcribed H3-H4 genes nucleates HLB formation and activates other histone genes in the histone gene cluster. In the absence of transcription from the H3-H4 promoter, “proto-HLBs” (containing only a subset of HLB components) form, and the adjacent histone H2a-H2b genes are not expressed. Proto-HLBs also transiently form in mutant embryos with the histone locus deleted. We conclude that HLB assembly occurs through a stepwise process involving stochastic interactions of individual components that localize to a specific sequence in the H3-H4 promoter.

Aurora B and Cyclin B Have Opposite Effects on the Timing of Cytokinesis Abscission in Drosophila Germ Cells and in Vertebrate Somatic Cells,

Abstract: Summary
Abscission is the last step of cytokinesis that physically separates the cytoplasm of sister cells. As the final stage of cell division, abscission is poorly characterized during animal development. Here, we show that Aurora B and Survivin regulate the number of germ cells in each Drosophila egg chamber by inhibiting abscission during differentiation. This inhibition is mediated by an Aurora B-dependent phosphorylation of Cyclin B, as a phosphomimic form of Cyclin B rescues premature abscission caused by a loss of function of Aurora B. We show that Cyclin B localizes at the cytokinesis bridge, where it promotes abscission. We propose that mutual inhibitions between Aurora B and Cyclin B regulate the duration of abscission and thereby the number of sister cells in each cyst. Finally, we show that inhibitions of Aurora B and Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity in vertebrate cells also have opposite effects on the timing of abscission, suggesting a possible conservation of these mechanisms.

Hec1-Dependent Cyclin B2 Stabilization Regulates the G2-M Transition and Early Prometaphase in Mouse Oocytes,

Abstract: Summary
The functions of the Ndc80/Hec1 subunit of the highly conserved Ndc80 kinetochore complex are normally restricted to M phase when it exerts a pivotal kinetochore-based role. Here, we find that in mouse oocytes, depletion of Hec1 severely compromises the G2-M transition because of impaired activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). Unexpectedly, impaired M phase entry is due to instability of the Cdk1-activating subunit, cyclin B2, which cannot be covered by cyclin B1. Hec1 protects cyclin B2 from destruction by the Cdh1-activated anaphase-promoting complex (APCCdh1) and remains important for cyclin B2 stabilization during early M phase, required for the initial stages of acentrosomal spindle assembly. By late M phase, however, Hec1 and cyclin B2 become uncoupled, and although Hec1 remains stable, APCCdc20 triggers cyclin B2 destruction. These data identify another dimension to Hec1 function centered on M phase entry and early prometaphase progression and challenge the view that cyclin B2 is completely dispensable in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Zinc is an essential cofactor of all major eukaryotic RNA polymerases. How the activity of these enzymes is coordinated or regulated according to cellular zinc levels is largely unknown. Here we show that the stability of RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) is tightly coupled to zinc availability in vivo. In zinc deficiency, RNAPI is specifically degraded by proteolysis in the vacuole in a pathway dependent on the exportin Xpo1p and deubiquitination of the RNAPI large subunit Rpa190p by Ubp2p and Ubp4p. RNAPII is unaffected, which allows for the expression of genes required in zinc deficiency. RNAPI export to the vacuole is required for survival during zinc starvation, suggesting that degradation of zinc-binding subunits might provide a last resort zinc reservoir. These results reveal a hierarchy of cellular transcriptional activities during zinc starvation and show that degradation of the most active cellular transcriptional machinery couples cellular growth and proliferation to zinc availability.

Abstract: Summary
Cone photoreceptors carry out phototransduction in daylight conditions and provide the critical first step in color vision. Despite their importance, little is known about the developmental mechanisms involved in their generation, particularly how they are determined relative to rod photoreceptors, the cells that initiate vision in dim light. Here, we report the identification of a cis-regulatory module (CRM) for the thyroid hormone receptor beta (Thrb) gene, an early cone marker. We found that ThrbCRM1 is active in progenitor cells biased to the production of cones and an interneuronal cell type, the horizontal cell (HC). Molecular analysis of ThrbCRM1 revealed that it is combinatorially regulated by the Otx2 and Onecut1 transcription factors. Onecut1 is sufficient to induce cells with the earliest markers of cones and HCs. Conversely, interference with Onecut1 transcriptional activity leads to precocious rod development, suggesting that Onecut1 is critically important in defining cone versus rod fates.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington disease (HD), a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CAG-encoded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in huntingtin (Htt), displays a highly heterogeneous etiopathology and disease onset. Here, we show that the translation of expanded CAG repeats in mutant Htt exon 1 leads to a depletion of charged glutaminyl-transfer RNA (tRNA)Gln-CUG that pairs exclusively to the CAG codon. This results in translational frameshifting and the generation of various transframe-encoded species that differently modulate the conformational switch to nucleate fibrillization of the parental polyQ protein. Intriguingly, the frameshifting frequency varies strongly among different cell lines and is higher in cells with intrinsically lower concentrations of tRNAGln-CUG. The concentration of tRNAGln-CUG also differs among different brain areas in the mouse. We propose that translational frameshifting may act as a significant disease modifier that contributes to the cell-selective neurotoxicity and disease course heterogeneity of HD on both cellular and individual levels.

Abstract: Summary
In Escherichia coli, bidirectional chromosomal replication is accompanied by the colocalization of sister replication forks. However, the biological significance of this mechanism and the key factors involved are still largely unknown. In this study, we found that a protein, termed CrfC, helps sustain the colocalization of nascent DNA regions of sister replisomes and promote chromosome equipartitioning. CrfC formed homomultimers that bound to multiple molecules of the clamp, a replisome subunit that encircles DNA, and colocalized with nascent DNA regions in a clamp-binding-dependent manner in living cells. CrfC is a dynamin homolog; however, it lacks the typical membrane-binding moiety and instead possesses a clamp-binding motif. Given that clamps remain bound to DNA after Okazaki fragment synthesis, we suggest that CrfC sustains the colocalization of sister replication forks in a unique manner by linking together the clamp-loaded nascent DNA strands, thereby laying the basis for subsequent chromosome equipartitioning.

Abstract: The Ca2+ modulation of pore formation (and disaggregation) kinetics of a synthetic analog of alamethicin F50/5 ([l-Glu(OMe)7,18,19]), a potent antibiotic peptide, was investigated in situ and in vitro. The in situ experiments consisted in whole-cell recording from isolated retinal rod outer segments (OS), because once blocking the only OS endogenous conductance with saturating light, the current flows entirely through the (exogenous) channels formed by the peptide. The kinetics of current change induced by peptide application and removal (in ∼50ms) on the OS extracellular side was measured in the presence of divalent cations at different concentrations. The in vitro experiments consisted on the divalent cations modulation of [l-Glu(OMe)7,18,19] binding to a mimetic OS membrane immobilized on a sensor chip surface, employing surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR). The presence of even low mM Ca2+ or Mg2+ sufficed to increase the [l-Glu(OMe)7,18,19] apparent affinity for the mimetic OS membrane up to ∼4-fold, which accelerated the activation of the peptide-induced current in OS by ∼10-fold with respect to low Ca2+. In situ and in vitro experiments indicate that high concentrations of divalent cations increased also membrane rigidity, contrasting their effect on increasing the pore formation rate.

Abstract: Expression of transient receptor potential canonical channels (TRPC) and the effects of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) on Ca2+ signals and fibroblast proliferation were investigated in human cardiac fibroblasts. The conventional and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, western blot, immunocytochemical analysis, and intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i measurement were applied. Cell proliferation and cell cycle progression were assessed using MTT assays and fluorescence activated cell sorting. Human cardiac fibroblasts have the expression of TRPC1,3,4,6 mRNA and proteins. 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) and thapsigargin induced extracellular Ca2+-mediated [Ca2+]i rise. siRNA for knock down of TRPC6 reduced OAG-induced Ca2+ entry. Hyperforin as well as angiotensin II (Ang II) induced Ca2+ entry. KB-R7943, a reverse-mode Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) inhibitor, and/or replacement of Na+ with NMDG+ inhibited thapsigargin-, OAG- and Ang II-induced Ca2+ entry. Treatment with TGF-β1 increased thapsigargin-, OAG- and Ang II-induced Ca2+ entry with an enhancement of TRPC1,6 protein expression, suppressed by KB-R7943. TGF-β1 and AngII promoted cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to S/G2/M and cell proliferation. A decrease of the extracellular Ca2+ and KB-R7943 suppressed it. Human cardiac fibroblasts contain several TRPC-mediated Ca2+ influx pathways, which activate the reverse-mode NCX. TGF-β1 enhances the Ca2+ influx pathways requiring Ca2+ signals for its effect on fibroblast proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic Kras activates a plethora of signaling pathways, but our understanding of critical Ras effectors is still very limited. We show that cell-autonomous phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), but not Craf, are key effectors of oncogenic Kras in the pancreas, mediating cell plasticity, acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) formation. This contrasts with Kras-driven non-small cell lung cancer, where signaling via Craf, but not PDK1, is an essential tumor-initiating event. These in vivo genetic studies together with pharmacologic treatment studies in models of human ADM and PDAC demonstrate tissue-specific differences of oncogenic Kras signaling and define PI3K/PDK1 as a suitable target for therapeutic intervention specifically in PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) regulates sister chromatid segregation and the exit from mitosis. Selection of most APC/C substrates is controlled by coactivator subunits (either Cdc20 or Cdh1) that interact with substrate destruction motifs—predominantly the destruction (D) box and KEN box degrons. How coactivators recognize D box degrons and how this is inhibited by APC/C regulatory proteins is not defined at the atomic level. Here, from the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Cdh1 in complex with its specific inhibitor Acm1, which incorporates D and KEN box pseudosubstrate motifs, we describe the molecular basis for D box recognition. Additional interactions between Acm1 and Cdh1 identify a third protein-binding site on Cdh1 that is likely to confer coactivator-specific protein functions including substrate association. We provide a structural rationalization for D box and KEN box recognition by coactivators and demonstrate that many noncanonical APC/C degrons bind APC/C coactivators at the D box coreceptor.

Abstract: Summary
At least half of the human genome is derived from repetitive elements, which are often lineage specific and silenced by a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Using a transchromosomic mouse strain that transmits an almost complete single copy of human chromosome 21 via the female germline, we show that a heterologous regulatory environment can transcriptionally activate transposon-derived human regulatory regions. In the mouse nucleus, hundreds of locations on human chromosome 21 newly associate with activating histone modifications in both somatic and germline tissues, and influence the gene expression of nearby transcripts. These regions are enriched with primate and human lineage-specific transposable elements, and their activation corresponds to changes in DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides. This study reveals the latent regulatory potential of the repetitive human genome and illustrates the species specificity of mechanisms that control it.

Abstract: Summary
The natural product englerin A (EA) binds to and activates protein kinase C-θ (PKCθ). EA-dependent activation of PKCθ induces an insulin-resistant phenotype, limiting the access of tumor cells to glucose. At the same time, EA causes PKCθ-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor heat shock factor 1, an inducer of glucose dependence. By promoting glucose addiction, while simultaneously starving cells of glucose, EA proves to be synthetically lethal to highly glycolytic tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Protein function is regulated by diverse posttranslational modifications. The mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT5 removes malonyl and succinyl moieties from target lysines. The spectrum of protein substrates subject to these modifications is unknown. We report systematic profiling of the mammalian succinylome, identifying 2,565 succinylation sites on 779 proteins. Most of these do not overlap with acetylation sites, suggesting differential regulation of succinylation and acetylation. Our analysis reveals potential impacts of lysine succinylation on enzymes involved in mitochondrial metabolism; e.g., amino acid degradation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle, and fatty acid metabolism. Lysine succinylation is also present on cytosolic and nuclear proteins; indeed, we show that a substantial fraction of SIRT5 is extramitochondrial. SIRT5 represses biochemical activity of, and cellular respiration through, two protein complexes identified in our analysis, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and succinate dehydrogenase. Our data reveal widespread roles for lysine succinylation in regulating metabolism and potentially other cellular functions.

Abstract: Summary
The CARMA1/Bcl10/MALT1 (CBM) signalosome mediates antigen receptor-induced NF-κB signaling to regulate multiple lymphocyte functions. While CARMA1 and Bcl10 contain caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), MALT1 is a paracaspase with structural similarity to caspases. Here we show that the reconstituted CBM signalosome is a helical filamentous assembly in which substoichiometric CARMA1 nucleates Bcl10 filaments. Bcl10 filament formation is a highly cooperative process whose threshold is sensitized by oligomerized CARMA1 upon receptor activation. In cells, both cotransfected CARMA1/Bcl10 complex and the endogenous CBM signalosome are filamentous morphologically. Combining crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron microscopy, we reveal the structure of the Bcl10 CARD filament and the mode of interaction between CARMA1 and Bcl10. Structure-guided mutagenesis confirmed the observed interfaces in Bcl10 filament assembly and MALT1 activation in vitro and NF-κB activation in cells. These data support a paradigm of nucleation-induced signal transduction with threshold response due to cooperativity and signal amplification by polymerization.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic imprinting leads to preferred expression of either the maternal or paternal alleles of a subset of genes. Imprinting is essential for mammalian development, and its deregulation causes many diseases. However, the functional relevance of imprinting at the cellular level is poorly understood for most imprinted genes. We used mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) in mice to create uniparental disomies (UPDs) and to visualize imprinting effects with single-cell resolution. Although chromosome 12 UPD did not produce detectable phenotypes, chromosome 7 UPD caused highly significant paternal growth dominance in the liver and lung, but not in the brain or heart. A single gene on chromosome 7, encoding the secreted insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), accounts for most of the paternal dominance effect. Mosaic analyses implied additional imprinted loci on chromosome 7 acting cell autonomously to transmit the IGF2 signal.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage activates checkpoint kinases that induce several downstream events, including widespread changes in transcription. However, the specific connections between the checkpoint kinases and downstream transcription factors (TFs) are not well understood. Here, we integrate kinase mutant expression profiles, transcriptional regulatory interactions, and phosphoproteomics to map kinases and downstream TFs to transcriptional regulatory networks. Specifically, we investigate the role of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae checkpoint kinases (Mec1, Tel1, Chk1, Rad53, and Dun1) in the transcriptional response to DNA damage caused by methyl methanesulfonate. The result is a global kinase-TF regulatory network in which Mec1 and Tel1 signal through Rad53 to synergistically regulate the expression of more than 600 genes. This network involves at least nine TFs, many of which have Rad53-dependent phosphorylation sites, as regulators of checkpoint-kinase-dependent genes. We also identify a major DNA damage-induced transcriptional network that regulates stress response genes independently of the checkpoint kinases.

Abstract: Summary
The proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax is predominantly found in the cytosol of nonapoptotic cells and is commonly thought to translocate to mitochondria following an apoptotic stimulus. The current model for Bax activation is that BH3 proteins bind to cytosolic Bax, initiating mitochondrial targeting and outer-membrane permeabilization. Here, we challenge this and show that Bax is constitutively targeted to mitochondria but in nonapoptotic cells is constantly translocated back to the cytosol. Using live-cell spinning-disk confocal imaging with a combination of FLIP, FRAP, and photoactivatable GFP-Bax, we demonstrate that disrupting adhesion-dependent survival signals slows the rate of Bax’s dissociation from mitochondria, leading to its accumulation on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The overall accumulation of mitochondrial Bax following loss of survival signaling sensitizes cells to proapoptotic BH3 proteins. Our findings show that Bax is normally in a dynamic equilibrium between cytosol and mitochondria, enabling fluctuations in survival signals to finely adjust apoptotic sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Modular cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) use substrate binding adaptor proteins to specify target ubiquitylation. Many of the ∼200 human CRL adaptor proteins remain poorly studied due to a shortage of efficient methods to identify biologically relevant substrates. Here, we report the development of parallel adaptor capture (PAC) proteomics and its use to systematically identify candidate targets for the leucine-rich repeat family of F-box proteins (FBXLs) that function with SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein (SCF) E3s. In validation experiments, we identify the unstudied F-box protein FBXL17 as a regulator of the NFR2 oxidative stress pathway. We demonstrate that FBXL17 controls the transcription of the NRF2 target HMOX1 via turnover of the transcriptional repressor BACH1 in the absence or presence of extrinsic oxidative stress. This work identifies a role for SCFFBXL17 in controlling the threshold for NRF2-dependent gene activation and provides a framework for elucidating the functions of CRL adaptor proteins.

Abstract: We examined ACh-induced [Ca2+]i dynamics in pancreatic acinar cells prepared from mAChR subtype-specific knockout (KO) mice. ACh did not induce any [Ca2+]i increase in the cells isolated from M1/M3 double KO mice. In the cells from M3KO mice, ACh (0.3–3μM) caused a monotonic [Ca2+]i increase. However, we found characteristic oscillatory [Ca2+]i increases in cells from M1KO mice in lower concentrations of ACh (0.03–0.3μM). We investigated the receptor specific pattern of [Ca2+]i increase in COS-7 cells transfected with M1 or M3 receptors. ACh induced the oscillatory [Ca2+]i increase in M3 expressing cells, but not in cells expressing M1, which exhibited monotonic [Ca2+]i increases. IP3 production detected in fluorescent indicator co-transfected cells was higher in M1 than in M3 expressing cells. From the examination of four types of M1/M3 chimera receptors we found that the carboxyl-terminal region of M3 was responsible for the generation of Ca2+ oscillations. The present results suggest that the oscillatory Ca2+ increase in response to M3 stimulation is dependent upon a moderate IP3 increase, which is suitable for causing Ca2+-dependent IP3-induced Ca2+ release. The C-terminal domain of M3 may contribute as a regulator of the efficiency of Gq and PLC cooperation.

Spp1, a Member of the Set1 Complex, Promotes Meiotic DSB Formation in Promoters by Tethering Histone H3K4 Methylation Sites to Chromosome Axes,

Abstract: Summary
Meiotic chromosomes are organized into arrays of loops that are anchored to the chromosome axis structure. Programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination, catalyzed by Spo11 and accessory DSB proteins, form in loop sequences in promoters, whereas the DSB proteins are located on chromosome axes. Mechanisms bridging these two chromosomal regions for DSB formation have remained elusive. Here we show that Spp1, a conserved member of the histone H3K4 methyltransferase Set1 complex, is required for normal levels of DSB formation and is associated with chromosome axes during meiosis, where it physically interacts with the Mer2 DSB protein. The PHD finger module of Spp1, which reads H3K4 methylation close to promoters, promotes DSB formation by tethering these regions to chromosome axes and activating cleavage by the DSB proteins. This paper provides the molecular mechanism linking DSB sequences to chromosome axes and explains why H3K4 methylation is important for meiotic recombination.

Abstract: Summary
Class I histone deacetylases (HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3) are recruited by cognate corepressor proteins into specific transcriptional repression complexes that target HDAC activity to chromatin resulting in chromatin condensation and transcriptional silencing. We previously reported the structure of HDAC3 in complex with the SMRT corepressor. This structure revealed the presence of inositol-tetraphosphate [Ins(1,4,5,6)P4] at the interface of the two proteins. It was previously unclear whether the role of Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 is to act as a structural cofactor or a regulator of HDAC3 activity. Here we report the structure of HDAC1 in complex with MTA1 from the NuRD complex. The ELM2-SANT domains from MTA1 wrap completely around HDAC1 occupying both sides of the active site such that the adjacent BAH domain is ideally positioned to recruit nucleosomes to the active site of the enzyme. Functional assays of both the HDAC1 and HDAC3 complexes reveal that Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 is a bona fide conserved regulator of class I HDAC complexes.

Abstract: Summary
The tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) has been identified as a tumor suppressor in a subset of human renal cell carcinomas. Human FH-deficient cancer cells display high fumarate concentration and ROS levels along with activation of HIF-1. The underlying mechanisms by which FH loss increases ROS and HIF-1 are not fully understood. Here, we report that glutamine-dependent oxidative citric acid cycle metabolism is required to generate fumarate and increase ROS and HIF-1 levels. Accumulated fumarate directly bonds the antioxidant glutathione in vitro and in vivo to produce the metabolite succinated glutathione (GSF). GSF acts as an alternative substrate to glutathione reductase to decrease NADPH levels and enhance mitochondrial ROS and HIF-1 activation. Increased ROS also correlates with hypermethylation of histones in these cells. Thus, fumarate serves as a proto-oncometabolite by binding to glutathione which results in the accumulation of ROS.

Abstract: Schizothorax richardsonii, commonly called snowtrout, is an important indigenous coldwater fish of the Himalayas, India with high commercial values as food and game fish. A cell line named as SRCF was developed from the caudal fin tissue of S. richardsonii. The cell line has been maintained in Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 24°C. The cells showed fibroblastic morphology, high plating efficiency and cell doubling time of 48h. Chromosomal analysis of SRCF cells revealed a diploid count of 98 chromosomes. The origin of the cell line was confirmed by the amplification of 655 and 578bp of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S rRNA of mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA) genes, respectively. Transfection of SRCF cells with pEGFP-C1 plasmid resulted in bright fluorescent signals, suggesting the application of cell line in transgenic and genetic improvement programme. In addition, genotoxicity assessment illustrated the utility of the cell line as an in vitro model for aquatic toxicological studies.

Abstract: Summary
Although the general relevance of chromatin modifications for genotoxic stress signaling, cell-cycle checkpoint activation, and DNA repair is well established, how these modifications reach initial thresholds in order to trigger robust responses remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify the chromatin-associated scaffold attachment factor SAFB1 as a component of the DNA damage response and show that SAFB1 cooperates with histone acetylation to allow for efficient γH2AX spreading and genotoxic stress signaling. SAFB1 undergoes a highly dynamic exchange at damaged chromatin in a poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase 1- and poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent manner and is required for unperturbed cell-cycle checkpoint activation and guarding cells against replicative stress. Altogether, our data reveal that transient recruitment of an architectural chromatin component is required in order to overcome physiological barriers by making chromatin permissive for DNA damage signaling, whereas the ensuing exclusion of SAFB1 may help prevent excessive signaling.

Synthesis and properties of Asante Calcium Red—A novel family of long excitation wavelength calcium indicators,

Abstract: Although many synthetic calcium indicators are available, a search for compounds with improved characteristics continues. Here, we describe the synthesis and properties of Asante Calcium Red-1 (ACR-1) and its low affinity derivative (ACR-1-LA) created by linking BAPTA to seminaphthofluorescein. The indicators combine a visible light (450–540nm) excitation with deep-red fluorescence (640nm). Upon Ca2+ binding, the indicators raise their fluorescence with longer excitation wavelengths producing higher responses. Although the changes occur without any spectral shifts, it is possible to ratio Ca2+-dependent (640nm) and quasi-independent (530nm) emission when using visible (<490nm) or multiphoton (∼780nm) excitation. Therefore, both probes can be used as single wavelength or, less dynamic, ratiometric indicators. Long indicator emission might allow easy [Ca2+]i measurement in GFP expressing cells. The indicators bind Ca2+ with either high (Kd=0.49±0.07μM; ACR-1) or low affinity (Kd=6.65±0.13μM; ACR-1-LA). Chelating Zn2+ (Kd=0.38±0.02nM) or Mg2+ (Kd∼5mM) slightly raises and binding Co2+ quenches dye fluorescence. New indicators are somewhat pH-sensitive (pKa=6.31±0.07), but fairly resistant to bleaching. The probes are rather dim, which combined with low AM ester loading efficiency, might complicate in situ imaging. Despite potential drawbacks, ACR-1 and ACR-1-LA are promising new calcium indicators.

Abstract: Summary
Translation factor eIF5A, containing the unique amino acid hypusine, was originally shown to stimulate Met-puromycin synthesis, a model assay for peptide bond formation. More recently, eIF5A was shown to promote translation elongation; however, its precise requirement in protein synthesis remains elusive. We use in vivo assays in yeast and in vitro reconstituted translation assays to reveal a specific requirement for eIF5A to promote peptide bond formation between consecutive Pro residues. Addition of eIF5A relieves ribosomal stalling during translation of three consecutive Pro residues in vitro, and loss of eIF5A function impairs translation of polyproline-containing proteins in vivo. Hydroxyl radical probing experiments localized eIF5A near the E site of the ribosome with its hypusine residue adjacent to the acceptor stem of the P site tRNA. Thus, eIF5A, like its bacterial ortholog EFP, is proposed to stimulate the peptidyl transferase activity of the ribosome and facilitate the reactivity of poor substrates like Pro.

Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen causing severe acute and chronic infections. Earlier we have shown that calcium (Ca2+) induces P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and production of virulence factors. To enable further studies of the regulatory role of Ca2+, we characterized Ca2+ homeostasis in P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells. By using Ca2+-binding photoprotein aequorin, we determined that the concentration of free intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]in) is 0.14±0.05μM. In response to external Ca2+, the [Ca2+]in quickly increased at least 13-fold followed by a multi-phase decline by up to 73%. Growth at elevated Ca2+ modulated this response. Treatment with inhibitors known to affect Ca2+ channels, monovalent cations gradient, or P-type and F-type ATPases impaired [Ca2+]in response, suggesting the importance of the corresponding mechanisms in Ca2+ homeostasis. To identify Ca2+ transporters maintaining this homeostasis, bioinformatic and LC–MS/MS-based membrane proteomic analyses were used. [Ca2+]in homeostasis was monitored for seven Ca2+-affected and eleven bioinformatically predicted transporters by using transposon insertion mutants. Disruption of P-type ATPases PA2435, PA3920, and ion exchanger PA2092 significantly impaired Ca2+ homeostasis. The lack of PA3920 and vanadate treatment abolished Ca2+-induced swarming, suggesting the role of the P-type ATPase in regulating P. aeruginosa response to Ca2+.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-surface multiprotein complexes are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they undergo cotranslational membrane integration and assembly. The quality control mechanisms that oversee these processes remain poorly understood. We show that less hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) regions derived from several single-pass TM proteins can enter the ER lumen completely. Once mislocalized, they are recognized by the Hsp70 chaperone BiP. In a detailed analysis for one of these proteins, the αβT cell receptor (αβTCR), we show that unassembled ER-lumenal subunits are rapidly degraded, whereas specific subunit interactions en route to the native receptor promote membrane integration of the less hydrophobic TM segments, thereby stabilizing the protein. For the TCR α chain, both complete ER import and subunit assembly depend on the same pivotal residue in its TM region. Thus, membrane integration linked to protein assembly allows cellular quality control of membrane proteins and connects the lumenal ER chaperone machinery to membrane protein biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The appropriate execution of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is critical for genome stability and tumor avoidance. 53BP1 and BRCA1 directly influence DSB repair pathway choice by regulating 5′ end resection, but how this is achieved remains uncertain. Here we report that Rif1−/− mice are severely compromised for 53BP1-dependent class switch recombination (CSR) and fusion of dysfunctional telomeres. The inappropriate accumulation of RIF1 at DSBs in S phase is antagonized by BRCA1, and deletion of Rif1 suppresses toxic nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) induced by PARP inhibition in Brca1-deficient cells. Mechanistically, RIF1 is recruited to DSBs via the N-terminal phospho-SQ/TQ domain of 53BP1, and DSBs generated by ionizing radiation or during CSR are hyperresected in the absence of RIF1. Thus, RIF1 and 53BP1 cooperate to block DSB resection to promote NHEJ in G1, which is antagonized by BRCA1 in S phase to ensure a switch of DSB repair mode to homologous recombination.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are resident immune cells of the CNS that are activated by infection, neuronal injury, and inflammation. Here, we utilize flow cytometry and deep RNA sequencing of acutely isolated spinal cord microglia to define their activation in vivo. Analysis of resting microglia identified 29 genes that distinguish microglia from other CNS cells and peripheral macrophages/monocytes. We then analyzed molecular changes in microglia during neurodegenerative disease activation using the SOD1G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We found that SOD1G93A microglia are not derived from infiltrating monocytes, and that both potentially neuroprotective and toxic factors, including Alzheimer’s disease genes, are concurrently upregulated. Mutant microglia differed from SOD1WT, lipopolysaccharide-activated microglia, and M1/M2 macrophages, defining an ALS-specific phenotype. Concurrent messenger RNA/fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed posttranscriptional regulation of microglia surface receptors and T cell-associated changes in the transcriptome. These results provide insights into microglia biology and establish a resource for future studies of neuroinflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Mature ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are produced from polycistronic precursors following complex processing. Precursor (pre)-rRNA processing has been extensively characterized in yeast and was assumed to be conserved in humans. We functionally characterized 625 nucleolar proteins in HeLa cells and identified 286 required for processing, including 74 without a yeast homolog. For selected candidates, we demonstrated that pre-rRNA processing defects are conserved in different cell types (including primary cells), defects are not due to activation of a p53-dependent nucleolar tumor surveillance pathway, and they precede cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. We also investigated the exosome’s role in processing internal transcribed spacers (ITSs) and report that 3′ end maturation of 18S rRNA involves EXOSC10/Rrp6, a yeast ITS2 processing factor. We conclude that human cells adopt unique strategies and recruit distinct trans-acting factors to carry out essential processing steps, posing fundamental implications for understanding ribosomopathies at the molecular level and developing effective therapeutic agents.

Abstract: Summary
Parkin, a RING-between-RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with Parkinson’s disease, has a wide neuroprotective activity, preventing cell death in various stress paradigms. We identified a stress-protective pathway regulated by parkin that links NF-κB signaling and mitochondrial integrity via linear ubiquitination. Under cellular stress, parkin is recruited to the linear ubiquitin assembly complex and increases linear ubiquitination of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), which is essential for canonical NF-κB signaling. As a result, the mitochondrial guanosine triphosphatase OPA1 is transcriptionally upregulated via NF-κB-responsive promoter elements for maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and protection from stress-induced cell death. Parkin-induced stress protection is lost in the absence of either NEMO or OPA1, but not in cells defective for the mitophagy pathway. Notably, in parkin-deficient cells linear ubiquitination of NEMO, activation of NF-κB, and upregulation of OPA1 are significantly reduced in response to TNF-α stimulation, supporting the physiological relevance of parkin in regulating this antiapoptotic pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were found to be dysregulated in a variety of tumors. However, it remains unknown how and through what molecular mechanisms the expression of lncRNAs is controlled. In this study, we found that the lncRNA Low Expression in Tumor (lncRNA-LET) was generally downregulated in hepatocellular carcinomas, colorectal cancers, and squamous-cell lung carcinomas. We demonstrated that hypoxia-induced histone deacetylase 3 repressed lncRNA-LET by reducing the histone acetylation-mediated modulation of the lncRNA-LET promoter region. Interestingly, the downregulation of lncRNA-LET was found to be a key step in the stabilization of nuclear factor 90 protein, which leads to hypoxia-induced cancer cell invasion. Moreover, the relationship among hypoxia, histone acetylation disorder, low lncRNA-LET expression level, and metastasis was found in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma samples. These results advance our understanding of the role of lncRNA-LET as a regulator of hypoxia signaling and offer new avenues for therapeutic intervention against cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
Zinc is an essential trace element, and impaired zinc homeostasis is implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases. However, the mechanisms cells use to respond to zinc deficiency are poorly understood. We previously reported that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked pathogenic mutants of SOD1 cause chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through specific interactions with Derlin-1, which is a component of the ER-associated degradation machinery. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that this interaction is common to ALS-linked SOD1 mutants, and wild-type SOD1 (SOD1WT) comprises a masked Derlin-1 binding region (DBR). Here, we found that, under zinc-deficient conditions, SOD1WT adopts a mutant-like conformation that exposes the DBR and induces the homeostatic ER stress response, including the inhibition of protein synthesis and induction of a zinc transporter. We conclude that SOD1 has a function as a molecular switch that activates the ER stress response, which plays an important role in cellular homeostasis under zinc-deficient conditions.

Abstract: A total of 140,000 compounds were screened in a targetfree cell-based high throughput assay against HIV-1 infection, and a subset of 81 promising compounds was identified. Secondary screening of these 81 compounds revealed two putative human RNaseH2 inhibitors, RHI001 and RHI002, with IC50 value of 6.8 µM and 16 µM, respectively. RHI002 showed selective activity against human RNaseH2 while RHI001 inhibited HIV-RNaseH, E. coli RNaseH, and human RNaseH1 with IC50 value of 28.5 µM, 7.9 gM, and 31.7 μM, respectively. Kinetic analysis revealed that both inhibitors had non-competitive inhibitor-like properties. Because RNaseH2 is involved in the etiology of Aicardi-Goutier syndrome and has been suggested as an anticancer drug target, small molecule inhibitors modulating its activity would be useful for investigating the cellular function of this molecule.

Abstract: Summary
The prosurvival protein BCL-2 is frequently overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. We have generated ER-positive primary breast tumor xenografts that recapitulate the primary tumors and demonstrate that the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 markedly improves tumor response to the antiestrogen tamoxifen. Despite abundant BCL-XL expression, similar efficacy was observed with the BCL-2 selective inhibitor ABT-199, revealing that BCL-2 is a crucial target. Unexpectedly, BH3 mimetics were found to counteract the side effect of tamoxifen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. Moreover, BH3 mimetics synergized with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in eliciting apoptosis. Importantly, these two classes of inhibitor further enhanced tumor response in combination therapy with tamoxifen. Collectively, our findings provide a rationale for the clinical evaluation of BH3 mimetics in therapy for breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Dosage compensation in Drosophila involves a global activation of genes on the male X chromosome. The activating complex (MSL-DCC) consists of male-specific-lethal (MSL) proteins and two long, noncoding roX RNAs. The roX RNAs are essential for X-chromosomal targeting, but their contributions to MSL-DCC structure and function are enigmatic. Conceivably, the RNA helicase MLE, itself an MSL subunit, is actively involved in incorporating roX into functional DCC. We determined the secondary structure of roX2 and mapped specific interaction sites for MLE in vitro. Upon addition of ATP, MLE disrupted a functionally important stem loop in roX2. This RNA remodeling enhanced specific ATP-dependent association of MSL2, the core subunit of the MSL-DCC, providing a link between roX and MSL subunits. Probing the conformation of roX in vivo revealed a remodeled stem loop in chromatin-bound roX2. The active remodeling of a stable secondary structure by MLE may constitute a rate-limiting step for MSL-DCC assembly.

Abstract: Hemocytes are a critical component of the mussel defense system and the present study aims at investigating their spreading and oxidative properties during phagocytosis under in vivo experimental stress conditions. The spreading ability was measured by an automated cell analyzer on the basis of the circularity, a parameter corresponding to the hemocyte roundness. The oxidative activity was investigated by micromethod assay, measuring the respiratory burst as expression of the fluorescence generated by the oxidation of specific probe. Following the application of high temperature and exposure to air, there was evidence of negative modulation of spreading and oxidative response, as revealed by a cell roundness increase and fluorescence generation decrease. Therefore, the fall of respiratory burst appeared as matched with the inhibition of hemocyte morphological activation, suggesting a potential depression of the phagocytosis process and confirming the application of the circularity parameter as potential stress marker, both in experimental and field studies.

LIN-12/Notch Regulates lag-1 and lin-12 Expression during Anchor Cell/Ventral Uterine Precursor Cell Fate Specification,

Abstract: During Caenorhabditis elegans gonadal development, a stochastic interaction between the LIN-12/Notch receptor and the LAG-2/Delta ligand initiates cell fate specification of two equivalent pre-anchor cell (AC)/pre-ventral uterine (VU) precursor cells. Both cells express lin-12 and lag-2before specification, and a small difference in LIN-12 activity leads to the exclusive expression of lin-12 in VUs and lag-2 in the AC through an unknown feedback mechanism. In this Notch signaling process, the cleaved LIN-12/Notch intracellular domain (NICD) binds to the LAG-1/CSL transcriptional repressor, forming a transcriptional activator complex containing LAG-1 and NICD. Here we show that clustered LAG-1 binding sites in lin-12 and lag-1 are involved in regulating lin-12 and lag-1 expression during AC/VU cell fate specification. Both genes are expressed in VU cells, but not the AC, after specification. We also show that lin-12 is necessary for lag-1 expression in VU cells. Interestingly, lin-12 (null) animals express lag-1 in the AC, suggesting that LIN-12 signaling is necessary for the suppression of lag-1 expression in the AC. Ectopic expression of lag-1 cDNA in the AC causes a defect in the vulvaluterine (V-U) connection; therefore, LAG-1 should be eliminated in the AC to form a normal V-U connection at a later developmental stage in wild-type animals.

Abstract: Summary
Nrf2 is a master regulator of the antioxidant response. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is polyubiquitinated by the Keap1-Cul3 E3 ligase and degraded by the 26S proteasome. In response to Nrf2 inducers there is a switch in polyubiquitination from Nrf2 to Keap1. Currently, regulation of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway by ubiquitination is largely understood. However, the mechanism responsible for removal of ubiquitin conjugated to Nrf2 or Keap1 remains unknown. Here we report that the deubiquitinating enzyme, USP15, specifically deubiquitinates Keap1, which suppresses the Nrf2 pathway. We demonstrated that deubiquitinated Keap1 incorporates into the Keap1-Cul3-E3 ligase complex more efficiently, enhancing the complex stability and enzymatic activity. Consequently, there is an increase in Nrf2 protein degradation and a reduction in Nrf2 target gene expression. Furthermore, USP15-siRNA enhances chemoresistance of cells through upregulation of Nrf2. These findings further our understanding of how the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is regulated, which is imperative in targeting this pathway for chemoprevention or chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Poly(ADP-ribos)ylation (PARylation) is a reversible posttranslational modification found in higher eukaryotes. However, little is known about PARylation acceptor proteins. Here, we describe a sensitive proteomics approach based on high-accuracy quantitative mass spectrometry for the identification of PARylated proteins induced under different cellular stress conditions. While confirming the majority of known PARylated substrates, our screen identifies numerous additional PARylation targets. In vivo and in vitro validation of acceptor proteins confirms that our methodology targets covalent PARylation. Nuclear proteins encompassing nucleic acid binding properties are prominently PARylated upon genotoxic stress, consistent with the nuclear localization of ARTD1/PARP1 and ARTD2/PARP2. Distinct differences in proteins becoming PARylated upon various genotoxic insults are observed, exemplified by the PARylation of RNA-processing factors THRAP3 and TAF15 under oxidative stress. High-content imaging reveals that PARylation affects the nuclear relocalization of THRAP3 and TAF15, demonstrating the potential of our approach to uncover hitherto unappreciated processes being controlled by specific genotoxic-stress-induced PARylation.

Phage dUTPases Control Transfer of Virulence Genes by a Proto-Oncogenic G Protein-like Mechanism,

Abstract: Summary
dUTPases (Duts) have emerged as promising regulatory molecules controlling relevant cellular processes. However, the mechanism underlying this regulatory function remains enigmatic. Using staphylococcal pathogenicity island (SaPI) repression as a model, we report here that phage Duts induce the transfer of SaPI-encoded virulence factors by switching between active (dUTP-bound) and inactive (apo state) conformations, a conversion catalyzed by their intrinsic dUTPase activity. Crystallographic and mutagenic analyses demonstrate that binding to dUTP reorders the C-terminal motif V of the phage-encoded Duts, rendering these proteins into the active conformation required for SaPI derepression. By contrast, the conversion to the apo state conformation by hydrolysis of the bound dUTP generates a protein that is unable to induce the SaPI cycle. Because none of the requirements involving Duts in SaPI transfer are exclusive to the phage-encoded proteins, we propose that Duts are widespread cellular regulators acting in a manner analogous to the eukaryotic G proteins.

Two Small GTPases Act in Concert with the Bactofilin Cytoskeleton to Regulate Dynamic Bacterial Cell Polarity,

Abstract: Summary
Cell polarity is essential for many bacterial activities, but the mechanisms responsible for its establishment are poorly understood. In Myxococcus xanthus, the type IV pili (T4P) motor ATPases PilB and PilT localize to opposite cell poles and switch poles during cellular reversals. We demonstrate that polar localization of PilB and PilT depends on the small GTPase SofG and BacP, a bactofilin cytoskeletal protein. Polymeric BacP localizes in both subpolar regions. SofG interacts directly with polymeric BacP and associates with one of these patches, forming a cluster that shuttles to the pole to establish localization of PilB and PilT at the same pole. Next, the small GTPase MglA sorts PilB and PilT to opposite poles to establish their correct polarity. During reversals, the Frz chemosensory system induces the inversion of PilB and PilT polarity. Thus, three hierarchically organized systems function in a cascade to regulate dynamic bacterial cell polarity.
