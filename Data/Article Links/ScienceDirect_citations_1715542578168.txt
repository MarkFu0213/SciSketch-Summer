Abstract: Summary
Microgravity is a major environmental factor of space flight that triggers dysregulation of the immune system and increases clinical risks for deep-space-exploration crews. However, systematic studies and molecular mechanisms of the adverse effects of microgravity on the immune system in animal models are limited. Here, we establish a ground-based zebrafish disease model of microgravity for the research of space immunology. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrates that the retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptor (RLR) and the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways are significantly compromised by simulated microgravity (Sμg). TRIM25, an essential E3 for RLR signaling, is inhibited under Sμg, hampering the K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I and the following function-induction positive feedback loop of antiviral immune response. These mechanisms provide insights into better understanding of the effects and principles of microgravity on host antiviral immunity and present broad potential implications for developing strategies that can prevent and control viral diseases during space flight.

Abstract: Summary
Reflecting its pleiotropic functions, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) localizes to various sub-cellular structures during mitosis. At kinetochores, PLK1 contributes to microtubule attachments and mitotic checkpoint signaling. Previous studies identified a wealth of potential PLK1 receptors at kinetochores, as well as requirements for various mitotic kinases, including BUB1, Aurora B, and PLK1 itself. Here, we combine ectopic localization, in vitro reconstitution, and kinetochore localization studies to demonstrate that most and likely all of the PLK1 is recruited through BUB1 in the outer kinetochore and centromeric protein U (CENP-U) in the inner kinetochore. BUB1 and CENP-U share a constellation of sequence motifs consisting of a putative PP2A-docking motif and two neighboring PLK1-docking sites, which, contingent on priming phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and PLK1 itself, bind PLK1 and promote its dimerization. Our results rationalize previous observations and describe a unifying mechanism for recruitment of PLK1 to human kinetochores.

Abstract: Summary
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a chronic, low-grade inflammatory disease characterized by insulin resistance and pancreatic β cell dysfunction; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report a key β cell-macrophage crosstalk pathway mediated by the miRNA-29-TNF-receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) axis. β cell-specific transgenic miR-29a/b/c mice are predisposed to develop glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The metabolic effect of β cell miR-29 is largely mediated through macrophages because either depletion of macrophages or reconstitution with miR-29-signaling defective bone marrow improves metabolic parameters in the transgenic mice. Mechanistically, our data show that miR-29 promotes the recruitment and activation of circulating monocytes and macrophages and, hence, inflammation, via miR-29 exosomes in a TRAF3-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate the ability of β cells to modulate the systemic inflammatory tone and glucose homeostasis via miR-29 in response to nutrient overload.

Abstract: Summary
Despite a growing appreciation for microglial influences on the developing brain, the responsiveness of microglia to insults during gestation remains less well characterized, especially in the embryo when microglia themselves are still maturing. Here, we asked if fetal microglia could coordinate an innate immune response to an exogenous insult. Using time-lapse imaging, we showed that hypothalamic microglia actively surveyed their environment by near-constant “touching” of radial glia projections. However, following an insult (i.e., IUE or AAV transduction), this seemingly passive touching became more intimate and long lasting, ultimately resulting in the retraction of radial glial projections and degeneration into small pieces. Mechanistically, the TAM receptors MERTK and AXL were upregulated in microglia following the insult, and Annexin V treatment inhibited radial glia breakage and engulfment by microglia. These data demonstrate a remarkable responsiveness of embryonic microglia to insults during gestation, a critical window for neurodevelopment.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells require substantial metabolic rewiring to overcome nutrient limitations and immune surveillance. However, the metabolic pathways necessary for pancreatic tumor growth in vivo are poorly understood. To address this, we performed metabolism-focused CRISPR screens in PDAC cells grown in culture or engrafted in immunocompetent mice. While most metabolic gene essentialities are unexpectedly similar under these conditions, a small fraction of metabolic genes are differentially required for tumor progression. Among these, loss of heme synthesis reduces tumor growth due to a limiting role of heme in vivo, an effect independent of tissue origin or immune system. Our screens also identify autophagy as a metabolic requirement for pancreatic tumor immune evasion. Mechanistically, autophagy protects cancer cells from CD8+ T cell killing through TNFα-induced cell death in vitro. Altogether, this resource provides metabolic dependencies arising from microenvironmental limitations and the immune system, nominating potential anti-cancer targets.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer immunotherapy shows limited efficacy against many solid tumors that originate from epithelial tissues, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We identify the SOX4 transcription factor as an important resistance mechanism to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity for TNBC cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that inactivation of SOX4 in tumor cells increases the expression of genes in a number of innate and adaptive immune pathways important for protective tumor immunity. Expression of SOX4 is regulated by the integrin αvβ6 receptor on the surface of tumor cells, which activates TGFβ from a latent precursor. An integrin αvβ6/8-blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibits SOX4 expression and sensitizes TNBC cells to cytotoxic T cells. This integrin mAb induces a substantial survival benefit in highly metastatic murine TNBC models poorly responsive to PD-1 blockade. Targeting of the integrin αvβ6-TGFβ–SOX4 pathway therefore provides therapeutic opportunities for TNBC and other highly aggressive human cancers of epithelial origin.

Abstract: MiR-124−3p regulates the biological function of endometrial cancer cells. However, the role of miR-124−3p in adenomyosis (AM) has not been reported. Hence, we hypothesized that miR-124−3p also regulated the development of AM. The expressions of miR-124−3p and Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) in AM endometrial tissues were evaluated by Quantitative Real-time-PCR (qPCR). Endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) were isolated from the eutopic endometrial tissue of women with AM and further identified using immunofluorescence. Then the target of miR-124−3p was predicted by Starbase V2.0 and verified by dual-luciferase assay. After transfection of miR-124−3p mimic, inhibitor, or NRP1 overexpression plasmids, the viability and migration of ESCs were measured by Cell counting kit -8 (CCK-8) and wound healing assays, respectively. The expressions of NRP1 and epithelial-stromal transformation (EST)-related factors were evaluated by Quantitative Real-time-PCR (qPCR) or Western blot. MiR-124−3p was down-regulated and NRP1 was up-regulated in AM eutopic endometrial tissues. NRP1 was targeted by miR-124−3p. The extracted ESCs were Vimentin-positive and Cytokeratin-negative. MiR-124−3p mimic decreased viability, migration, and the expressions of NRP1, Vimentin, N-cadherin, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) in ESCs while increasing the expression of E-cadherin. MiR-124−3p inhibitor and NRP1 overexpression had the contrary effect of miR-124−3p on ESCs. Furthermore, NRP1 overexpression offset the effect of miR-124−3p mimic on viability, migration, and expressions of NRP1 and EMT-related factors in ESCs. MiR-124−3p regulated the migration and EMT of ESCs by down-regulating NRP1.

Abstract: Summary
Enzymes maintain metabolism, and their concentration affects cellular fitness: high enzyme levels are costly, and low enzyme levels can limit metabolic flux. Here, we used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to study the consequences of decreasing E. coli enzymes below wild-type levels. A pooled CRISPRi screen with 7,177 strains demonstrates that metabolism buffers fitness defects for hours after the induction of CRISPRi. We characterized the metabolome and proteome responses in 30 CRISPRi strains and elucidated three gene-specific buffering mechanisms: ornithine buffered the knockdown of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CarAB) by increasing CarAB activity, S-adenosylmethionine buffered the knockdown of homocysteine transmethylase (MetE) by de-repressing expression of the methionine pathway, and 6-phosphogluconate buffered the knockdown of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Gnd) by activating a bypass. In total, this work demonstrates that CRISPRi screens can reveal global sources of metabolic robustness and identify local regulatory mechanisms that buffer decreases of specific enzymes. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Abstract: Summary
Metastases account for most cancer-related deaths, yet the mechanisms underlying metastatic spread remain poorly understood. Recent evidence demonstrates that senescent cells, while initially restricting tumorigenesis, can induce tumor progression. Here, we identify the metalloproteinase inhibitor TIMP1 as a molecular switch that determines the effects of senescence in prostate cancer. Senescence driven either by PTEN deficiency or chemotherapy limits the progression of prostate cancer in mice. TIMP1 deletion allows senescence to promote metastasis, and elimination of senescent cells with a senolytic BCL-2 inhibitor impairs metastasis. Mechanistically, TIMP1 loss reprograms the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of senescent tumor cells through activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Loss of PTEN and TIMP1 in prostate cancer is frequent and correlates with resistance to docetaxel and worst clinical outcomes in patients treated in an adjuvant setting. Altogether, these findings provide insights into the dual roles of tumor-associated senescence and can potentially impact the treatment of prostate cancer.

Abstract: Background
The TLQP-21 peptide potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, hence we investigated its endogenous response to glucose.
Methods
Fasted mice received intraperitoneal glucose (3 g/kg), or saline (controls), and were sacrificed 30 and 120 min later (4 groups, n = 6/group). We investigated TLQP-21 in pancreas and plasma using immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as well as TLQP-21 receptors (gC1q-R and C3a-R1) expression in pancreas by immunohistochemistry.
Results
In pancreas, TLQP-immunoreactivity (TLQP-ir.) was shown in insulin-, glucagon- and somatostatin-containing cells. Upon glucose, TLQP-ir. decreased at 30 min (∼40 % vs. controls), while returning to basal values at 120 min. In all groups, C3a-R1 was localized in ∼50 % of TLQP labelled islet cells (mostly central), while gC1q-R was detected in ∼25 % of TLQP cells (mainly peripheral). HPLC fractions of control pancreas extracts, assessed by ELISA, confirmed the presence of a TLQP-21 compatible-form (∼2.5 kDa MW). In plasma, TLQP-ir. increased at 30 min (∼30 %), with highest concentrations at 120 min (both: p<0.05 vs. controls), while HPLC fractions showed an increase in the TLQP-21 compatible form.
Conclusions
Upon hyperglycaemia, TLQP-21 would be released from islets, to enhance insulin secretion but we cannot exclude an autocrine activity which may regulate insulin storage/secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Although eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) normally possess a 5′ end N7-methyl guanosine (m7G) cap, a non-canonical 5′ nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) cap can tag certain transcripts for degradation mediated by the NAD+ decapping enzyme DXO1. Despite this importance, whether NAD+ capping dynamically responds to specific stimuli to regulate eukaryotic transcriptomes remains unknown. Here, we reveal a link between NAD+ capping and tissue- and hormone response-specific mRNA stability. In the absence of DXO1 function, transcripts displaying a high proportion of NAD+ capping are instead processed into RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6-dependent small RNAs, resulting in their continued turnover likely to free the NAD+ molecules. Additionally, the NAD+-capped transcriptome is significantly remodeled in response to the essential plant hormone abscisic acid in a mechanism that is primarily independent of DXO1. Overall, our findings reveal a previously uncharacterized and essential role of NAD+ capping in dynamically regulating transcript stability during specific physiological responses.

Abstract: Human mitochondria are complex and highly dynamic biological systems, comprised of over a thousand parts and evolved to fully integrate into the specialized intracellular signaling networks and metabolic requirements of each cell and organ. Over the last two decades, several complementary, top-down computational and experimental approaches have been developed to identify, characterize and modulate the human mitochondrial system, demonstrating the power of integrating classical reductionist and discovery-driven analyses in order to de-orphanize hitherto unknown molecular components of mitochondrial machineries and pathways. To this goal, systematic, multiomics-based surveys of proteome composition, protein networks, and phenotype-to-pathway associations at the tissue, cell and organellar level have been largely exploited to predict the full complement of mitochondrial proteins and their functional interactions, therefore catalyzing data-driven hypotheses. Collectively, these multidisciplinary and integrative research approaches hold the potential to propel our understanding of mitochondrial biology and provide a systems-level framework to unraveling mitochondria-mediated and disease-spanning pathomechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
It is critical that epiblast cells within blastocyst-stage embryos receive the necessary regulatory cues to remain pluripotent until the appropriate time when they are stimulated to undergo differentiation, ultimately to give rise to an entire organism. Here, we show that exposure of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which are the in vitro equivalents of epiblasts, to ESC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) helps to maintain their stem cell properties even under culture conditions that would otherwise induce differentiation. EV-treated ESCs continued to express stemness genes, preserving their pluripotency and ability to generate chimeric mice. These effects were triggered by fibronectin bound to the surfaces of EVs, enabling them to interact with ESC-associated integrins and activate FAK more effectively than fibronectin alone. Overall, these findings highlight a potential regulatory mechanism whereby epiblast cells, via their shed EVs, create an environment within the blastocyst that prevents their premature differentiation and maintains their pluripotent state.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms of cellular energy sensing and AMPK-mediated mTORC1 inhibition are not fully delineated. Here, we discover that RIPK1 promotes mTORC1 inhibition during energetic stress. RIPK1 is involved in mediating the interaction between AMPK and TSC2 and facilitate TSC2 phosphorylation at Ser1387. RIPK1 loss results in a high basal mTORC1 activity that drives defective lysosomes in cells and mice, leading to accumulation of RIPK3 and CASP8 and sensitization to cell death. RIPK1-deficient cells are unable to cope with energetic stress and are vulnerable to low glucose levels and metformin. Inhibition of mTORC1 rescues the lysosomal defects and vulnerability to energetic stress and prolongs the survival of RIPK1-deficient neonatal mice. Thus, RIPK1 plays an important role in the cellular response to low energy levels and mediates AMPK-mTORC1 signaling. These findings shed light on the regulation of mTORC1 during energetic stress and unveil a point of crosstalk between pro-survival and pro-death pathways.

Abstract: The submandibular ganglion (SMG) contains parasympathetic neurons which innervate the submandibular gland. In this study, immunohistochemistry for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V members 1 (TRPV1) and 2 (TRPV2) was performed on the human SMG. In the SMG, 17.5 % and 8.9 % of parasympathetic neurons were immunoreactive for VIP and TRPV2, respectively. SMG neurons mostly contained ChAT- and DBH-immunoreactivity. In addition, subpopulations of SMG neurons were surrounded by VIP (69.6 %)-, TRPV2 (54.4 %)- and DBH (9.5 %)-immunoreactive (-ir) nerve fibers. SMG neurons with pericellular VIP- and TRPV2-ir nerve fibers were significantly larger than VIP- and TRPV2-ir SMG neurons, respectively. Other neurochemical substances were rare in the SMG. In the human submandibular gland, TRPV1- and TRPV2-ir nerve fiber profiles were seen around blood vessels. Double fluorescence method also demonstrated that TRPV2-ir nerve fiber profiles were located around myoepithelial and acinar cells in the submandibular gland. VIP and TRPV2 are probably expressed by both pre- and post-ganglionic neurons innervating the submandibular and sublingual glands. VIP, DBH and TRPV2 may have functions about regulation of salivary components in the salivary glands and neuronal activity in the SMG.

Abstract: Summary
Rho is a general transcription termination factor playing essential roles in RNA polymerase (RNAP) recycling, gene regulation, and genomic stability in most bacteria. Traditional models of transcription termination postulate that hexameric Rho loads onto RNA prior to contacting RNAP and then translocates along the transcript in pursuit of the moving RNAP to pull RNA from it. Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of two termination process intermediates. Prior to interacting with RNA, Rho forms a specific “pre-termination complex” (PTC) with RNAP and elongation factors NusA and NusG, which stabilize the PTC. RNA exiting RNAP interacts with NusA before entering the central channel of Rho from the distal C-terminal side of the ring. We map the principal interactions in the PTC and demonstrate their critical role in termination. Our results support a mechanism in which the formation of a persistent PTC is a prerequisite for termination.

Abstract: Avian species comprise more than half of all vertebrates yet there is a dearth of information regarding spermatid development in this class of animals. This report of spermiogenesis in the cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis, is the first in the order Pelecaniformes. Five sexually mature and reproductively active male cattle egrets were captured in the wild, humanely euthanized, the reproductive organs dissected out, and tissues from the testes routinely prepared for transmission electron microscopy. Twelve steps of spermatid development, using the step-wise system, were determined. Acrosomogenesis in the egret results in a relatively short, solid, bullet-shaped acrosome that ends bluntly anteriorly and flat posteriorly or basally. The nucleus displays remarkable morphological changes, with the anterior end of the mature spermatid becoming flat, lacking a rostrum and an endonuclear canal. A perforatorium does not develop. It is noteworthy that a longitudinal, but not a circular, manchette develops during spermiogenesis in this bird. The proximal centriole is attached to the nucleus, at the implantation fossa, by means of well-formed, electron dense struts of material. An amorphous fibrous sheath develops in the principal piece. The interesting development and peculiar features of the acrosome and nucleus, as well as the absence of the perforatorium and circular manchette in the spermatozoon of the cattle egret, may be of phylogenetic significance.

Abstract: Malaria, one of the leading causes of death in underdeveloped countries, is primarily diagnosed using microscopy. Computer-aided diagnosis of malaria is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of some uninfected and infected class. In this paper, we transform a malaria parasite object detection dataset into a classification dataset, making it the largest malaria classification dataset (63,645 cells), and evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures pretrained on both natural and medical images on this new dataset. We provide detailed insights into the variation of the dataset and qualitative analysis of the results produced by the best models. We also evaluate the models using an independent test set to demonstrate the model's ability to generalize in different domains. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of conditional image synthesis on malaria parasite detection. We provide detailed insights into the influence of synthetic images for the class imbalance problem in the malaria diagnosis context.

Abstract: Summary
In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there remain unanswered questions regarding the nature and significance of the humoral immune response toward other coronavirus infections. Here, we investigate the cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) for their reactivity toward SARS-CoV-2. We extensively characterize a selection of 10 antibodies covering all of the SARS-CoV structural proteins: spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, and envelope. Although nearly all of the examined SARS-CoV antibodies display some level of reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, we find only partial cross-neutralization for the spike antibodies. The implications of our work are two-fold. First, we establish a set of antibodies with known reactivity to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which will allow further study of both viruses. Second, we provide empirical evidence of the high propensity for antibody cross-reactivity between distinct strains of human coronaviruses, which is critical information for designing diagnostic and vaccine strategies for COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
Asymmetric division, a hallmark of endospore development, generates two cells, a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore. Approximately 75% of the forespore chromosome must be translocated across the division septum into the forespore by the DNA translocase SpoIIIE. Asymmetric division also triggers cell-specific transcription, which initiates septal peptidoglycan remodeling involving synthetic and hydrolytic enzymes. How these processes are coordinated has remained a mystery. Using Bacillus subtilis, we identified factors that revealed the link between chromosome translocation and peptidoglycan remodeling. In cells lacking these factors, the asymmetric septum retracts, resulting in forespore cytoplasmic leakage and loss of DNA translocation. Importantly, these phenotypes depend on septal peptidoglycan hydrolysis. Our data support a model in which SpoIIIE is anchored at the edge of a septal pore, stabilized by newly synthesized peptidoglycan and protein-protein interactions across the septum. Together, these factors ensure coordination between chromosome translocation and septal peptidoglycan remodeling to maintain spore development.

Abstract: Summary
Retrotransposon proliferation poses a threat to germline integrity. While retrotransposons must be activated in developing germ cells in order to survive and propagate, how they are selectively activated in the context of meiosis is unclear. We demonstrate that the transcriptional activation of Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposons and host defense are controlled by master meiotic regulators. We show that budding yeast Ty3/Gypsy co-opts binding sites of the essential meiotic transcription factor Ndt80 upstream of the integration site, thereby tightly linking its transcriptional activation to meiotic progression. We also elucidate how yeast cells thwart Ty3/Gypsy proliferation by blocking translation of the retrotransposon mRNA using amyloid-like assemblies of the RNA-binding protein Rim4. In mammals, several inactive Ty3/Gypsy elements are undergoing domestication. We show that mammals utilize equivalent master meiotic regulators (Stra8, Mybl1, Dazl) to regulate Ty3/Gypsy-derived genes in developing gametes. Our findings inform how genes that are evolving from retrotransposons can build upon existing regulatory networks during domestication.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome assembly is catalyzed by numerous trans-acting factors and coupled with irreversible pre-rRNA processing, driving the pathway toward mature ribosomal subunits. One decisive step early in this progression is removal of the 5′ external transcribed spacer (5′-ETS), an RNA extension at the 18S rRNA that is integrated into the huge 90S pre-ribosome structure. Upon endo-nucleolytic cleavage at an internal site, A1, the 5′-ETS is separated from the 18S rRNA and degraded. Here we present biochemical and cryo-electron microscopy analyses that depict the RNA exosome, a major 3′-5′ exoribonuclease complex, in a super-complex with the 90S pre-ribosome. The exosome is docked to the 90S through its co-factor Mtr4 helicase, a processive RNA duplex-dismantling helicase, which strategically positions the exosome at the base of 5′-ETS helices H9-H9’, which are dislodged in our 90S-exosome structures. These findings suggest a direct role of the exosome in structural remodeling of the 90S pre-ribosome to drive eukaryotic ribosome synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomes promote cellular homeostasis through macromolecular hydrolysis within their lumen and metabolic signaling by the mTORC1 kinase on their limiting membranes. Both hydrolytic and signaling functions require precise regulation of lysosomal cholesterol content. In Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), loss of the cholesterol exporter, NPC1, causes cholesterol accumulation within lysosomes, leading to mTORC1 hyperactivation, disrupted mitochondrial function, and neurodegeneration. The compositional and functional alterations in NPC lysosomes and nature of aberrant cholesterol-mTORC1 signaling contribution to organelle pathogenesis are not understood. Through proteomic profiling of NPC lysosomes, we find pronounced proteolytic impairment compounded with hydrolase depletion, enhanced membrane damage, and defective mitophagy. Genetic and pharmacologic mTORC1 inhibition restores lysosomal proteolysis without correcting cholesterol storage, implicating aberrant mTORC1 as a pathogenic driver downstream of cholesterol accumulation. Consistently, mTORC1 inhibition ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction in a neuronal model of NPC. Thus, cholesterol-mTORC1 signaling controls organelle homeostasis and is a targetable pathway in NPC.

Abstract: Summary
In all branches of life, stalled translation intermediates are recognized and processed by ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathways. RQC begins with the splitting of stalled ribosomes, leaving an unfinished polypeptide still attached to the large subunit. Ancient and conserved NEMF family RQC proteins target these incomplete proteins for degradation by the addition of C-terminal “tails.” How such tailing can occur without the regular suite of translational components is, however, unclear. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (EM) of native complexes, we show that C-terminal tailing in Bacillus subtilis is mediated by NEMF protein RqcH in concert with RqcP, an Hsp15 family protein. Our structures reveal how these factors mediate tRNA movement across the ribosomal 50S subunit to synthesize polypeptides in the absence of mRNA or the small subunit.

Abstract: Gain-of-function RyR1-p.R163C mutation in ryanodine receptors type 1 (RyR1) deregulates Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle and causes malignant hyperthermia in humans and mice under triggering conditions. We investigated whether T lymphocytes from heterozygous RyR1-p.R163C knock-in mutant mice (HET T cells) display measurable aberrations in resting cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), Ca2+ release from the store, store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), and mitochondrial inner membrane potential (ΔΨm) compared with T lymphocytes from wild-type mice (WT T cells). We explored whether these variables can be used to distinguish between T cells with normal and altered RyR1 genotype. HET and WT T cells were isolated from spleen and lymph nodes and activated in vitro using phytohemagglutinin P. [Ca2+]i and ΔΨm dynamics were examined using Fura 2 and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester fluorescent dyes, respectively. Activated HET T cells displayed elevated resting [Ca2+]i, diminished responses to Ca2+ mobilization with thapsigargin, and decreased rate of [Ca2+]i elevation in response to SOCE compared with WT T cells. Pretreatment of HET T cells with ryanodine or dantrolene sodium reduced disparities in the resting [Ca2+]i and ability of thapsigargin to mobilize Ca2+ between HET and WT T cells. While SOCE elicited dissipation of the ΔΨm in WT T cells, it produced ΔΨm hyperpolarization in HET T cells. When used as the classification variable, the amplitude of thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ transient showed the best promise in predicting the presence of RyR1-p.R163C mutation. Other significant variables identified by machine learning analysis were the ratio of resting cytosolic Ca2+ level to the amplitude of thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ transient and an integral of changes in ΔΨm in response to SOCE. Our study demonstrated that gain-of-function mutation in RyR1 significantly affects Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial fiction in T lymphocytes, which suggests that this mutation may cause altered immune responses in its carrier. Our data link the RyR1-p.R163C mutation, which causes inherited skeletal muscle diseases, to deregulation of Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial function in immune T cells and establish proof-of-principle for in vitro T cell-based diagnostic assay for hereditary RyR1 hyperfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Rpb4/7 binds RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) transcripts co-transcriptionally and accompanies them throughout their lives. By virtue of its capacity to interact with key regulators (e.g., RNA Pol II, eIF3, and Pat1) temporally and spatially, Rpb4/7 regulates the major stages of the mRNA life cycle. Here we show that Rpb4/7 can undergo more than 100 combinations of post-translational modifications (PTMs). Remarkably, the Rpb4/7 PTM repertoire changes as the mRNA/Rpb4/7 complex progresses from one stage to the next. These temporal PTMs regulate Rpb4 interactions with key regulators of gene expression that control transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages. Moreover, one mutant type specifically affects mRNA synthesis, whereas the other affects mRNA synthesis and decay; both types disrupt the balance between mRNA synthesis and decay (“mRNA buffering”) and the cell’s capacity to respond to the environment. We propose that temporal Rpb4/7 PTMs mediate the cross-talk among the various stages of the mRNA life cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have demonstrated immunologic dysfunction in severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy (n = 3) and COVID-19 patients with moderate disease (n = 5), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, n = 6), or recovering from ARDS (n = 6). Our data reveal transcriptomic profiles indicative of defective antigen presentation and interferon (IFN) responsiveness in monocytes from ARDS patients, which contrasts with higher responsiveness to IFN signaling in lymphocytes. Furthermore, genes involved in cytotoxic activity are suppressed in both natural killer (NK) and CD8 T lymphocytes, and B cell activation is deficient, which is consistent with delayed viral clearance in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Our study demonstrates that COVID-19 patients with ARDS have a state of immune imbalance in which dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses may be contributing to a more severe disease course.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle regeneration after injury is essential for maintaining muscle function throughout aging. ARHGEF3, a RhoA/B-specific GEF, negatively regulates myoblast differentiation through Akt signaling independently of its GEF activity in vitro. Here, we report ARHGEF3’s role in skeletal muscle regeneration revealed by ARHGEF3-KO mice. These mice exhibit indiscernible phenotype under basal conditions. Upon acute injury, however, ARHGEF3 deficiency enhances the mass/fiber size and function of regenerating muscles in both young and regeneration-defective middle-aged mice. Surprisingly, these effects occur independently of Akt but via the GEF activity of ARHGEF3. Consistently, overexpression of ARHGEF3 inhibits muscle regeneration in a Rho-associated kinase-dependent manner. We further show that ARHGEF3 KO promotes muscle regeneration through activation of autophagy, a process that is also critical for maintaining muscle strength. Accordingly, ARHGEF3 depletion in old mice prevents muscle weakness by restoring autophagy. Taken together, our findings identify a link between ARHGEF3 and autophagy-related muscle pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural cultures from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients can model disease phenotypes. However, heterogeneity arising from genetic and experimental variability limits their utility, impacting reproducibility and the ability to track cellular origins of pathogenesis. Here, we present methodologies using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to address these limitations. By repeatedly differentiating and applying scRNA-seq to motor neurons (MNs) from healthy, familial ALS, sporadic ALS, and genome-edited iPSC lines across multiple patients, batches, and platforms, we account for genetic and experimental variability toward identifying unified and reproducible ALS signatures. Combining HOX and developmental gene expression with global clustering, we anatomically classified cells into rostrocaudal, progenitor, and postmitotic identities. By relaxing statistical thresholds, we discovered genes in iPSC-MNs that were concordantly dysregulated in postmortem MNs and yielded predictive ALS markers in other human and mouse models. Our approach thus revealed early, convergent, and MN-resolved signatures of ALS.

Abstract: Summary
Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) is a highly conserved complex with key roles in various aspects of DNA repair. Here, we report a new function for MRX in limiting transcription in budding yeast. We show that MRX interacts physically and colocalizes on chromatin with the transcriptional co-regulator Mediator. MRX restricts transcription of coding and noncoding DNA by a mechanism that does not require the nuclease activity of Mre11. MRX is required to tether transcriptionally active loci to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and it also promotes large-scale gene-NPC interactions. Moreover, MRX-mediated chromatin anchoring to the NPC contributes to chromosome folding and helps to control gene expression. Together, these findings indicate that MRX has a role in transcription and chromosome organization that is distinct from its known function in DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
Naive and memory T cells are maintained in a quiescent state, yet capable of rapid response and differentiation to antigen challenge via molecular mechanisms that are not fully understood. In naive cells, the deletion of Foxo1 following thymic development results in the increased expression of multiple AP-1 family members, rendering T cells less able to respond to antigenic challenge. Similarly, in the absence of FOXO1, post-infection memory T cells exhibit the characteristics of extended activation and senescence. Age-based analysis of human peripheral T cells reveals that levels of FOXO1 and its downstream target, TCF7, are inversely related to host age, whereas the opposite is found for AP-1 factors. These characteristics of aging also correlate with the formation of T cells manifesting features of cellular senescence. Our work illustrates a role for FOXO1 in the active maintenance of stem-like properties in T cells at the timescales of acute infection and organismal life span.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) silences expression of developmental transcription factors in pluripotent stem cells by methylating lysine 27 on histone H3. Two mutually exclusive subcomplexes, PRC2.1 and PRC2.2, are defined by the set of accessory proteins bound to the core PRC2 subunits. Here we introduce separation-of-function mutations into the SUZ12 subunit of PRC2 to drive it into a PRC2.1 or 2.2 subcomplex in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We find that PRC2.2 occupies polycomb target genes at low levels and that homeobox transcription factors are upregulated when this complex is exclusively present. In contrast with previous studies, we find that chromatin occupancy of PRC2 increases drastically when it is forced to form PRC2.1. Additionally, several cancer-associated mutations also coerce formation of PRC2.1. We suggest that PRC2 chromatin occupancy can be altered in the context of disease or development by tuning the ratio of PRC2.1 to PRC2.2.

Abstract: Summary
Hyocholic acid (HCA) and its derivatives are found in trace amounts in human blood but constitute approximately 76% of the bile acid (BA) pool in pigs, a species known for its exceptional resistance to type 2 diabetes. Here, we show that BA depletion in pigs suppressed secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and increased blood glucose levels. HCA administration in diabetic mouse models improved serum fasting GLP-1 secretion and glucose homeostasis to a greater extent than tauroursodeoxycholic acid. HCA upregulated GLP-1 production and secretion in enteroendocrine cells via simultaneously activating G-protein-coupled BA receptor, TGR5, and inhibiting farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a unique mechanism that is not found in other BA species. We verified the findings in TGR5 knockout, intestinal FXR activation, and GLP-1 receptor inhibition mouse models. Finally, we confirmed in a clinical cohort, that lower serum concentrations of HCA species were associated with diabetes and closely related to glycemic markers.

Abstract: Summary
The hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex are considered the main brain structures for allocentric representation of the external environment. Here, we show that the amygdala and the ventral visual stream are involved in allocentric representation. Thirty-one young men explored 35 virtual environments during high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and were subsequently tested on recall of the allocentric pattern of the objects in each environment—in other words, the positions of the objects relative to each other and to the outer perimeter. We find increasingly unique brain activation patterns associated with increasing allocentric accuracy in distinct neural populations in the perirhinal cortex, parahippocampal cortex, fusiform cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. In contrast to the traditional view of a hierarchical MTL network with the hippocampus at the top, we demonstrate, using recently developed graph analyses, a hierarchical allocentric MTL network without a main connector hub.

Abstract: Summary
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by expanded CTG/CCTG repeats, causing symptoms in skeletal muscle, heart, and central nervous system (CNS). CNS issues are debilitating and include hypersomnolence, executive dysfunction, white matter atrophy, and neurofibrillary tangles. Here, we generate RNA-seq transcriptomes from DM and unaffected frontal cortex and identify 130 high-confidence splicing changes, most occurring only in cortex, not skeletal muscle or heart. Mis-spliced exons occur in neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and synaptic scaffolds, and GRIP1 mis-splicing modulates kinesin association. Optical mapping of expanded CTG repeats reveals extreme mosaicism, with some alleles showing >1,000 CTGs. Mis-splicing severity correlates with CTG repeat length across individuals. Upregulated genes tend to be microglial and endothelial, suggesting neuroinflammation, and downregulated genes tend to be neuronal. Many gene expression changes strongly correlate with mis-splicing, suggesting candidate biomarkers of disease. These findings provide a framework for mechanistic and therapeutic studies of the DM CNS.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how animals detect and respond to pathogen threats is central to dissecting mechanisms of host immunity. The oomycetes represent a diverse eukaryotic group infecting various hosts from nematodes to humans. We have previously shown that Caenorhabditis elegans mounts a defense response consisting of the induction of chitinase-like (chil) genes in the epidermis to combat infection by its natural oomycete pathogen Myzocytiopsis humicola. We provide here evidence that C. elegans can sense the oomycete by detecting an innocuous extract derived from animals infected with M. humicola. The oomycete recognition response (ORR) leads to changes in the cuticle and reduction in pathogen attachment, thereby increasing animal survival. We also show that TAX-2/TAX-4 function in chemosensory neurons is required for the induction of chil-27 in the epidermis in response to extract exposure. Our findings highlight that neuron-to-epidermis communication may shape responses to oomycete recognition in animal hosts.

Abstract: Oxidative stress injury (OSI) occurs in many cardiovascular diseases, and the OSI of endothelial cells is the main pathological basis of these diseases. Tectorigenin has an effect on oxidative stress in fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and neuroblastoma. This study attempted to reveal the effect of Tectorigenin on OSI in endothelial cells. An OSI cell model was firstly established by treating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with H2O2. The H2O2-induced HUVECs were further pre-treated with Tectorigenin or PI3K inhibitor. Then the viability and apoptosis of HUVECs were evaluated using MTT, Hochest 33258 staining and TUNEL staining. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) level were measured through colorimetric assays. The expressions of apoptosis-related factors and the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in HUVECs were detected by RT-qPCR or Western blot. Tectorigenin had no inhibiting effect on the viability of HUVECs at the concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 0.5, 1, and 10 μmol/L. Tectorigenin reversed the H2O2 induced-destruction of HUVECs morphology. Tectorigenin increased the viability and decreased the apoptosis of H2O2-induced HUVECs. Tectorigenin increased Bcl-2 expression and the enzyme activities of SOD and GSH-Px, but decreased LDH leakage, MDA level, and the expressions of Bax and Cleaved Caspase-3 in H2O2-induced HUVECs. Furthermore, Tectorigenin increased the ratios of p-PI3K to PI3K and p-Akt to Akt in H2O2-induced HUVECs. PI3K inhibitor had an opposite effect of Tectorigenin on the OSI in H2O2-induced HUVECs and its effect was further reversed by Tectorigenin. Tectorigenin protected HUVECs against H2O2-induced OSI via PI3K/Akt pathway.

Abstract: The use of natural supplies is a resource to mimic an original extracellular matrix that allows for migration, proliferation, and cellular organization. Chitosan from Brazilian Atlantic Ocean had low protein, minerals percentage and excellent antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate and to compare the effectiveness of different types of acids as solvents with Brazilian chitosan-membrane in the healing process of skin lesions. Experimental full-thickness 2 × 2 cm wounds were created on the dorsum skin of Wistar rats. The applied different treatments were saline, collagenase®, microcrystalline chitosan salt membrane (MCSM), microcrystalline chitosan acetic acid membrane (MCAAM), and microcrystalline chitosan hydrochloric acid membrane (MCHAM). The wound repairs were measured morphologically and histologically on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14. The exudate formation and the final wound contractions were similar in all of the groups. There were mild exudations in the groups with chitosan-membranes, despite the formation of crust under the membrane. This configured a serum hematic aspect, but there was no impact on the healing process. The MCHAM group had more favorable aspects that histologically showed the healing phases. A significant migration of neutrophils and macrophages seen by myeloperoxidade and Beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase activities was evident in the chitosan groups, MCHAM and MCSM, respectively. Furthermore, the MCHAM group created its histological arrangement in a dense and more consistent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived organoids have emerged as novel multicellular models of human tissue development but display immature phenotypes, aberrant tissue fates, and a limited subset of cells. Here, we demonstrate that integrated analysis and engineering of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in PSC-derived multilineage human liver organoids direct maturation and vascular morphogenesis in vitro. Overexpression of PROX1 and ATF5, combined with targeted CRISPR-based transcriptional activation of endogenous CYP3A4, reprograms tissue GRNs and improves native liver functions, such as FXR signaling, CYP3A4 enzymatic activity, and stromal cell reactivity. The engineered tissues possess superior liver identity when compared with other PSC-derived liver organoids and show the presence of hepatocyte, biliary, endothelial, and stellate-like cell populations in single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Finally, they show hepatic functions when studied in vivo. Collectively, our approach provides an experimental framework to direct organogenesis in vitro by systematically probing molecular pathways and transcriptional networks that promote tissue development.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, hearing loss is irreversible due to the lack of regenerative potential of non-sensory cochlear cells. Neonatal cochlear cells, however, can grow into organoids that harbor sensory epithelial cells, including hair cells and supporting cells. Here, we purify different cochlear cell types from neonatal mice, validate the composition of the different groups with single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and assess the various groups’ potential to grow into inner ear organoids. We find that the greater epithelial ridge (GER), a transient cell population that disappears during post-natal cochlear maturation, harbors the most potent organoid-forming cells. We identified three distinct GER cell groups that correlate with a specific spatial distribution of marker genes. Organoid formation was synergistically enhanced when the cells were cultured at increasing density. This effect is not due to diffusible signals but requires direct cell-to-cell contact. Our findings improve the development of cell-based assays to study culture-generated inner ear cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation-dependent base deaminases promote therapeutic resistance in many malignancies. However, their roles in human pre-leukemia stem cell (pre-LSC) evolution to acute myeloid leukemia stem cells (LSCs) had not been elucidated. Comparative whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing analyses of FACS-purified pre-LSCs from myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients reveal APOBEC3C upregulation, an increased C-to-T mutational burden, and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation during progression, which can be recapitulated by lentiviral APOBEC3C overexpression. In pre-LSCs, inflammatory splice isoform overexpression coincides with APOBEC3C upregulation and ADAR1p150-induced A-to-I RNA hyper-editing. Pre-LSC evolution to LSCs is marked by STAT3 editing, STAT3β isoform switching, elevated phospho-STAT3, and increased ADAR1p150 expression, which can be prevented by JAK2/STAT3 inhibition with ruxolitinib or fedratinib or lentiviral ADAR1 shRNA knockdown. Conversely, lentiviral ADAR1p150 expression enhances pre-LSC replating and STAT3 splice isoform switching. Thus, pre-LSC evolution to LSCs is fueled by primate-specific APOBEC3C-induced pre-LSC proliferation and ADAR1-mediated splicing deregulation.

Abstract: Summary
The conjunctival epithelium, which covers the sclera (the white of the eye) and lines the inside of the eyelids, is essential for mucin secretion and the establishment of a healthy tear film. Here, we describe human conjunctival development in a self-formed ectodermal autonomous multi-zone (SEAM) of cells that were derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and mimic whole-eye development. Our data indicate that epidermal growth factor (EGF) drives the generation of cells with a conjunctival epithelial lineage. We also show that individual conjunctival cells can be sorted and reconstituted by cultivation into a functional conjunctival epithelium that includes mucin-producing goblet cells. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), moreover, is necessary for the maturation of hiPSC-derived conjunctival epithelium—particularly the goblet cells—indicating key complementary roles of EGF and KGF in directing the differentiation and maturation, respectively, of the human conjunctival epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
Gene activation requires the cooperative activity of multiple transcription factors at cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Yet, most transcription factors have short residence time, questioning the requirement of their physical co-occupancy on DNA to achieve cooperativity. Here, we present a DNA footprinting method that detects individual molecular interactions of transcription factors and nucleosomes with DNA in vivo. We apply this strategy to quantify the simultaneous binding of multiple transcription factors on single DNA molecules at mouse CREs. Analysis of the binary occupancy patterns at thousands of motif combinations reveals that high DNA co-occupancy occurs for most types of transcription factors, in the absence of direct physical interaction, at sites of competition with nucleosomes. Perturbation of pairwise interactions demonstrates the function of molecular co-occupancy in binding cooperativity. Our results reveal the interactions regulating CREs at molecular resolution and identify DNA co-occupancy as a widespread cooperativity mechanism used by transcription factors to remodel chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
Tethering of synaptic vesicles (SVs) to the active zone determines synaptic strength, although the molecular basis governing SV tethering is elusive. Here, we discover that small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) and SVs from rat brains coat on the surface of condensed liquid droplets formed by active zone proteins RIM, RIM-BP, and ELKS via phase separation. Remarkably, SUV-coated RIM/RIM-BP condensates are encapsulated by synapsin/SUV condensates, forming two distinct SUV pools reminiscent of the reserve and tethered SV pools that exist in presynaptic boutons. The SUV-coated RIM/RIM-BP condensates can further cluster Ca2+ channels anchored on membranes. Thus, we reconstitute a presynaptic bouton-like structure mimicking the SV-tethered active zone with its one side attached to the presynaptic membrane and the other side connected to the synapsin-clustered SV condensates. The distinct interaction modes between membraneless protein condensates and membrane-based organelles revealed here have general implications in cellular processes, including vesicular formation and trafficking, organelle biogenesis, and autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein is the target of vaccine design efforts to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite a low mutation rate, isolates with the D614G substitution in the S protein appeared early during the pandemic and are now the dominant form worldwide. Here, we explore S conformational changes and the effects of the D614G mutation on a soluble S ectodomain construct. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures reveal altered receptor binding domain (RBD) disposition; antigenicity and proteolysis experiments reveal structural changes and enhanced furin cleavage efficiency of the G614 variant. Furthermore, furin cleavage alters the up/down ratio of the RBDs in the G614 S ectodomain, demonstrating an allosteric effect on RBD positioning triggered by changes in the SD2 region, which harbors residue 614 and the furin cleavage site. Our results elucidate SARS-CoV-2 S conformational landscape and allostery and have implications for vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
NAD+ metabolism is implicated in aging and cancer. However, its role in immune checkpoint regulation and immune evasion remains unclear. Here, we find nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD+ biogenesis, drives interferon γ (IFNγ)-induced PD-L1 expression in multiple types of tumors and governs tumor immune evasion in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. Mechanistically, NAD+ metabolism maintains activity and expression of methylcytosine dioxygenase Tet1 via α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). IFNγ-activated Stat1 facilitates Tet1 binding to Irf1 to regulate Irf1 demethylation, leading to downstream PD-L1 expression on tumors. Importantly, high NAMPT-expressing tumors are more sensitive to anti-PD-L1 treatment and NAD+ augmentation enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 antibody in immunotherapy-resistant tumors. Collectively, these data delineate an NAD+ metabolism-dependent epigenetic mechanism contributing to tumor immune evasion, and NAD+ replenishment combined with PD-(L)1 antibody provides a promising therapeutic strategy for immunotherapy-resistant tumors.

Abstract: Ca2+ sparks are instrumental to understand physiological and pathological Ca2+ signaling in the heart. High-speed two spatially dimensional (2D) confocal imaging (>120 Hz) enables acquisition of sparks with high-content information, however, owing to a wide variety of different acquisition modalities the question arises: how much they reflect the “true” Ca2+ spark properties. To address this issue, we compared a fast point and a 2D-array scanner equipped with a range of different detectors. As a quasi-standard biological sample, we employed Ca2+ sparks in permeabilized and intact mouse ventricular myocytes and utilized an unbiased, automatic Ca2+ spark analysis tool, iSpark. Data from the point scanner suffered from low pixel photon fluxes (PPF) concomitant with high Poissonian noise. Images from the 2D-array scanner displayed substantially increased PPF, lower Poissonian noise and almost 3-fold increased sign-to-noise ratios. Noteworthy, data from the 2D scanner suffered from considerable inter-pinhole crosstalk evident for the permeabilized cells. Spark properties, such as frequency, amplitude, decay time and spatial spread were distinctly different for any scanner/detector combination. Our study reveals that the apparent Ca2+ spark properties differ dependent on the particular recording modality and set-up employed, quantitatively.

Abstract: Summary
Heterobifunctional proteolysis-targeting chimeric compounds leverage the activity of E3 ligases to induce degradation of target oncoproteins and exhibit potent preclinical antitumor activity. To dissect the mechanisms regulating tumor cell sensitivity to different classes of pharmacological “degraders” of oncoproteins, we performed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing studies. We observed that myeloma cell resistance to degraders of different targets (BET bromodomain proteins, CDK9) and operating through CRBN (degronimids) or VHL is primarily mediated by prevention of, rather than adaptation to, breakdown of the target oncoprotein; and this involves loss of function of the cognate E3 ligase or interactors/regulators of the respective cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complex. The substantial gene-level differences for resistance mechanisms to CRBN- versus VHL-based degraders explains mechanistically the lack of cross-resistance with sequential administration of these two degrader classes. Development of degraders leveraging more diverse E3 ligases/CRLs may facilitate sequential/alternating versus combined uses of these agents toward potentially delaying or preventing resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The presence of two separate afferent channels from the olfactory glomeruli to different targets in the brain is unravelled in the lamprey. The mitral-like cells send axonal projections directly to the piriform cortex in the ventral part of pallium, whereas the smaller tufted-like cells project separately and exclusively to a relay nucleus called the dorsomedial telencephalic nucleus (dmtn). This nucleus, located at the interface between the olfactory bulb and pallium, in turn projects to a circumscribed area in the anteromedial, ventral part of pallium. The tufted-like cells are activated with short latency from the olfactory nerve and terminate with mossy fibers on the dmtn cells, wherein they elicit large unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). In all synapses along this tufted-like cell pathway, there is no concurrent inhibition, in contrast to the mitral-like cell pathway. This is similar to recent findings in rodents establishing two separate exclusive projection patterns, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved organization.

Abstract: In the last decades, the communication between the Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria has obtained great attention: mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which represent the contact sites between the two organelles, have indeed emerged as central hub involved in different fundamental cell processes, such as calcium signalling, apoptosis, autophagy and lipid biosynthesis. Consistently, dysregulation of ER-mitochondria crosstalk has been associated with different pathological conditions, ranging from diabetes to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will try to summarize the current knowledge on MAMs’ structure and functions in health and their relevance for human diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk gene ApoE4 perturbs brain lipid homeostasis and energy transduction. However, the cell-type-specific mechanism of ApoE4 in modulating brain lipid metabolism is unclear. Here, we describe a detrimental role of ApoE4 in regulating fatty acid (FA) metabolism across neuron and astrocyte in tandem with their distinctive mitochondrial phenotypes. ApoE4 disrupts neuronal function by decreasing FA sequestering in lipid droplets (LDs). FAs in neuronal LDs are exported and internalized by astrocytes, with ApoE4 diminishing the transport efficiency. Further, ApoE4 lowers FA oxidation and leads to lipid accumulation in both astrocyte and the hippocampus. Importantly, diminished capacity of ApoE4 astrocytes in eliminating neuronal lipids and degrading FAs accounts for their compromised metabolic and synaptic support to neurons. Collectively, our findings reveal a mechanism of ApoE4 disruption to brain FA and bioenergetic homeostasis that could underlie the accelerated lipid dysregulation and energy deficits and increased AD risk for ApoE4 carriers.

Abstract: Summary
Hallmarks of mature β cells are restricted proliferation and a highly energetic secretory state. Paradoxically, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is synthesized throughout adulthood, its cytosolic localization raising the likelihood of cell cycle-independent functions. In the absence of any changes in β cell mass, maturity, or proliferation, genetic deletion of Cdk2 in adult β cells enhanced insulin secretion from isolated islets and improved glucose tolerance in vivo. At the single β cell level, CDK2 restricts insulin secretion by increasing KATP conductance, raising the set point for membrane depolarization in response to activation of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cycle with mitochondrial fuels. In parallel with reduced β cell recruitment, CDK2 restricts oxidative glucose metabolism while promoting glucose-dependent amplification of insulin secretion. This study provides evidence of essential, non-canonical functions of CDK2 in the secretory pathways of quiescent β cells.

Abstract: Summary
The small molecule ISRIB antagonizes the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) by phosphorylated translation initiation factor 2, eIF2(αP). ISRIB and eIF2(αP) bind distinct sites in their common target, eIF2B, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eIF2. We have found that ISRIB-mediated acceleration of eIF2B’s nucleotide exchange activity in vitro is observed preferentially in the presence of eIF2(αP) and is attenuated by mutations that desensitize eIF2B to the inhibitory effect of eIF2(αP). ISRIB’s efficacy as an ISR inhibitor in cells also depends on presence of eIF2(αP). Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) showed that engagement of both eIF2B regulatory sites by two eIF2(αP) molecules remodels both the ISRIB-binding pocket and the pockets that would engage eIF2α during active nucleotide exchange, thereby discouraging both binding events. In vitro, eIF2(αP) and ISRIB reciprocally opposed each other’s binding to eIF2B. These findings point to antagonistic allostery in ISRIB action on eIF2B, culminating in inhibition of the ISR.

Abstract: Human amniotic mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs) are considered as a population of multipotent cells. The molecular events associated with mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)/tumor cell interactions should be studied to identify the role of MSCs on suppressing or inducing the key signaling pathways of tumor cells. Thus, designing therapeutic approaches is considered as important. In the present study, hAMSCs and MiaPaca2 cells were first cultured separately. In addition, both cell lines were co-cultured by using 0.4 μm pore sized transwell membranes in different times. Further, the RNA of the cells was extracted, and Bcl2, Bax, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-Src, C-terminal Src Kinase (CSK), and SGK223 expression were analyzed through quantitative real time PCR. Furthermore, the total cell lysates of the cells were prepared and analyzed by using western blot. Based on the results, the expression of EGFR, c-Src, SGK223, and CSK in MiaPaca2 cells reduced after treating with hAMSCs. Notably, the cellular apoptosis of MiaPaca2 cells was induced in 2D cell culture system. Further, the anti-cancer activity of conditioned medium from hAMSCs was confirmed in a 3D cell culture model by using hanging drop technique. Finally, hAMSCs have inhibitory effects on pancreatic cancer cells and can be considered as a therapeutic way to suppress EGFR, c-Src, and SGK223, as the potent targets in cancer cell signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Skin undergoes constant self-renewal, and its functional decline is a visible consequence of aging. Understanding human skin aging requires in-depth knowledge of the molecular and functional properties of various skin cell types. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of human eyelid skin from healthy individuals across different ages and identified eleven canonical cell types, as well as six subpopulations of basal cells. Further analysis revealed progressive accumulation of photoaging-related changes and increased chronic inflammation with age. Transcriptional factors involved in the developmental process underwent early-onset decline during aging. Furthermore, inhibition of key transcription factors HES1 in fibroblasts and KLF6 in keratinocytes not only compromised cell proliferation, but also increased inflammation and cellular senescence during aging. Lastly, we found that genetic activation of HES1 or pharmacological treatment with quercetin alleviated cellular senescence of dermal fibroblasts. These findings provide a single-cell molecular framework of human skin aging, providing a rich resource for developing therapeutic strategies against aging-related skin disorders.

Abstract: TNFα-stimulated gene-6 (TNFAIP6) plays an important role in the prognosis of many tumors. Our objective was to investigate the clinical and prognostic value of TNFAIP6 expression in gastric cancer (GC) patients. Here, we investigated the expression of TNFAIP6 in GC tissues using western blotting and immunohistochemistry and the association between TNFAIP6 expression and the prognosis and clinicopathological parameters of GC patients. Our results revealed that the expression of TNFAIP6 was higher in GC tissue than in normal gastric tissue, and the levels were positively correlated with the depth of tumor invasion (P = 0.010), tumors with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.000) and TNM stage (P = 0.003) of GC patients. Moreover, the results revealed that patients with high TNFAIP6 expression exhibited poorer overall survival than those with low TNFAIP6 expression (P = 0.037). Additionally, knockdown of TNFAIP6 inhibited the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of GC cells in vitro. High TNFAIP6 expression was associated with the depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage and poor prognosis of GC patients, suggesting that TNFAIP6 may serve as a novel indicator of the prognosis and as a treatment target of GC.

Abstract: Summary
Genetically identical female honeybee larvae with different diets develop into sterile workers or fertile queens. It remains unknown whether the reversible RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mark functionally impact this “caste differentiation.” Here, we profile the transcriptome-wide m6A methylome of honeybee queen and worker larvae at three instar stages and discover that m6A methylation dynamics are altered by differential feeding. Multiple methylome comparisons show an obvious increase in m6A marks during larval development and reveal a negative correlation between gene expression and m6A methylation. Notably, we find that worker larvae contain more hypermethylated m6A peaks than do queen larvae, and many caste-differentiation-related transcripts are differentially methylated. Chemical suppression of m6A methylation in worker larvae by 3-deazaadenosine (DAA) reduces overall m6A methylation levels and triggers worker larvae to develop queen caste features. Thus, our study demonstrates that m6A functionally impacts caste differentiation and larval development, yet it does not exclude potential contributions from other factors.

Abstract: Summary
Somite formation is foundational to creating the vertebrate segmental body plan. Here, we describe three transcriptional trajectories toward somite formation in the early mouse embryo. Precursors of the anterior-most somites ingress through the primitive streak before E7 and migrate anteriorly by E7.5, while a second wave of more posterior somites develops in the vicinity of the streak. Finally, neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are set aside for subsequent trunk somitogenesis. Single-cell profiling of T−/− chimeric embryos shows that the anterior somites develop in the absence of T and suggests a cell-autonomous function of T as a gatekeeper between paraxial mesoderm production and the building of the NMP pool. Moreover, we identify putative regulators of early T-independent somites and challenge the T-Sox2 cross-antagonism model in early NMPs. Our study highlights the concept of molecular flexibility during early cell-type specification, with broad relevance for pluripotent stem cell differentiation and disease modeling.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane contact sites facilitate the exchange of metabolites between organelles to support interorganellar communication. The nucleus-vacuole junctions (NVJs) establish physical contact between the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the vacuole. Although the NVJ tethers are known, how NVJ abundance and composition are controlled in response to metabolic cues remains elusive. Here, we identify the ER protein Snd3 as central factor for NVJ formation. Snd3 interacts with NVJ tethers, supports their targeting to the contacts, and is essential for NVJ formation. Upon glucose exhaustion, Snd3 relocalizes from the ER to NVJs and promotes contact expansion regulated by central glucose signaling pathways. Glucose replenishment induces the rapid dissociation of Snd3 from the NVJs, preceding the slow disassembly of the junctions. In sum, this study identifies a key factor required for formation and regulation of NVJs and provides a paradigm for metabolic control of membrane contact sites.

Abstract: Summary
Presynaptic action potential spikes control neurotransmitter release and thus interneuronal communication. However, the properties and the dynamics of presynaptic spikes in the neocortex remain enigmatic because boutons in the neocortex are small and direct patch-clamp recordings have not been performed. Here, we report direct recordings from boutons of neocortical pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Our data reveal rapid and large presynaptic action potentials in layer 5 neurons and fast-spiking interneurons reliably propagating into axon collaterals. For in-depth analyses, we establish boutons of mature cultured neurons as models for excitatory neocortical boutons, demonstrating that the presynaptic spike amplitude is unaffected by potassium channels, homeostatic long-term plasticity, and high-frequency firing. In contrast to the stable amplitude, presynaptic spikes profoundly broaden during high-frequency firing in layer 5 pyramidal neurons, but not in fast-spiking interneurons. Thus, our data demonstrate large presynaptic spikes and fundamental differences between excitatory and inhibitory boutons in the neocortex.

Abstract: Summary
Haploinsufficiency of transcriptional regulators causes human congenital heart disease (CHD); however, the underlying CHD gene regulatory network (GRN) imbalances are unknown. Here, we define transcriptional consequences of reduced dosage of the CHD transcription factor, TBX5, in individual cells during cardiomyocyte differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We discovered highly sensitive dysregulation of TBX5-dependent pathways—including lineage decisions and genes associated with heart development, cardiomyocyte function, and CHD genetics—in discrete subpopulations of cardiomyocytes. Spatial transcriptomic mapping revealed chamber-restricted expression for many TBX5-sensitive transcripts. GRN analysis indicated that cardiac network stability, including vulnerable CHD-linked nodes, is sensitive to TBX5 dosage. A GRN-predicted genetic interaction between Tbx5 and Mef2c, manifesting as ventricular septation defects, was validated in mice. These results demonstrate exquisite and diverse sensitivity to TBX5 dosage in heterogeneous subsets of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and predicts candidate GRNs for human CHDs, with implications for quantitative transcriptional regulation in disease.

Abstract: Summary
While the role of transcription factors and coactivators in controlling enhancer activity and chromatin structure linked to gene expression is well established, the involvement of corepressors is not. Using inflammatory macrophage activation as a model, we investigate here a corepressor complex containing GPS2 and SMRT both genome-wide and at the Ccl2 locus, encoding the chemokine CCL2 (MCP-1). We report that corepressors co-occupy candidate enhancers along with the coactivators CBP (H3K27 acetylase) and MED1 (mediator) but act antagonistically by repressing eRNA transcription-coupled H3K27 acetylation. Genome editing, transcriptional interference, and cistrome analysis reveals that apparently related enhancer and silencer elements control Ccl2 transcription in opposite ways. 4C-seq indicates that corepressor depletion or inflammatory signaling functions mechanistically similarly to trigger enhancer activation. In ob/ob mice, adipose tissue macrophage-selective depletion of the Ccl2 enhancer-transcribed eRNA reduces metaflammation. Thus, the identified corepressor-eRNA-chemokine pathway operates in vivo and suggests therapeutic opportunities by targeting eRNAs in immuno-metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Kidney disease is poorly understood because of the organ’s cellular diversity. We used single-cell RNA sequencing not only in resolving differences in injured kidney tissue cellular composition but also in cell-type-specific gene expression in mouse models of kidney disease. This analysis highlighted major changes in cellular diversity in kidney disease, which markedly impacted whole-kidney transcriptomics outputs. Cell-type-specific differential expression analysis identified proximal tubule (PT) cells as the key vulnerable cell type. Through unbiased cell trajectory analyses, we show that PT cell differentiation is altered in kidney disease. Metabolism (fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation) in PT cells showed the strongest and most reproducible association with PT cell differentiation and disease. Coupling of cell differentiation and the metabolism was established by nuclear receptors (estrogen-related receptor alpha [ESRRA] and peroxisomal proliferation-activated receptor alpha [PPARA]) that directly control metabolic and PT-cell-specific gene expression in mice and patient samples while protecting from kidney disease in the mouse model.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatidylserine (PS) is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells and is known to promote immunosuppressive signals in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Antibodies that block PS interaction with its receptors have been shown to repolarize the TME into a proinflammatory state. Radiation therapy (RT) is an effective focal treatment of isolated solid tumors but is less effective at controlling metastatic cancers. We found that tumor-directed RT caused an increase in expression of PS on the surface of viable immune infiltrates in mouse B16 melanoma. We hypothesize that PS expression on immune cells may provide negative feedback to immune cells in the TME. Treatment with an antibody that targets PS (mch1N11) enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of tumor-directed RT and improved overall survival. This combination led to an increase in proinflammatory tumor-associated macrophages. The addition of anti-PD-1 to RT and mch1N11 led to even greater anti-tumor efficacy and overall survival. We found increased PS expression on several immune subsets in the blood of patients with metastatic melanoma after receiving tumor-directed RT. These findings highlight the potential of combining PS targeting with RT and PD-1 pathway blockade to improve outcomes in patients with advanced-stage cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Increased neoantigens in hypermutated cancers with DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) are proposed as the major contributor to the high objective response rate in anti-PD-1 therapy. However, the mechanism of drug resistance is not fully understood. Using tumor models defective in the MMR gene Mlh1 (dMLH1), we show that dMLH1 tumor cells accumulate cytosolic DNA and produce IFN-β in a cGAS-STING-dependent manner, which renders dMLH1 tumors slowly progressive and highly sensitive to checkpoint blockade. In neoantigen-fixed models, dMLH1 tumors potently induce T cell priming and lose resistance to checkpoint therapy independent of tumor mutational burden. Accordingly, loss of STING or cGAS in tumor cells decreases tumor infiltration of T cells and endows resistance to checkpoint blockade. Clinically, downregulation of cGAS/STING in human dMMR cancers correlates with poor prognosis. We conclude that DNA sensing within tumor cells is essential for dMMR-triggered anti-tumor immunity. This study provides new mechanisms and biomarkers for anti-dMMR-cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
We performed RNA-seq and high-resolution mass spectrometry on 128 blood samples from COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients with diverse disease severities and outcomes. Quantified transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and lipids were associated with clinical outcomes in a curated relational database, uniquely enabling systems analysis and cross-ome correlations to molecules and patient prognoses. We mapped 219 molecular features with high significance to COVID-19 status and severity, many of which were involved in complement activation, dysregulated lipid transport, and neutrophil activation. We identified sets of covarying molecules, e.g., protein gelsolin and metabolite citrate or plasmalogens and apolipoproteins, offering pathophysiological insights and therapeutic suggestions. The observed dysregulation of platelet function, blood coagulation, acute phase response, and endotheliopathy further illuminated the unique COVID-19 phenotype. We present a web-based tool (covid-omics.app) enabling interactive exploration of our compendium and illustrate its utility through a machine learning approach for prediction of COVID-19 severity.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosomes form heterogeneous groups in vivo, named clutches. Clutches are smaller and less dense in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) compared to neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Using coarse-grained modeling of the pluripotency Pou5f1 gene, we show that the genome-wide clutch differences between ESCs and NPCs can be reproduced at a single gene locus. Larger clutch formation in NPCs is associated with changes in the compaction and internucleosome contact probability of the Pou5f1 fiber. Using single-molecule tracking (SMT), we further show that the core histone protein H2B is dynamic, and its local mobility relates to the structural features of the chromatin fiber. H2B is less stable and explores larger areas in ESCs compared to NPCs. The amount of linker histone H1 critically affects local H2B dynamics. Our results have important implications for how nucleosome organization and H2B dynamics contribute to regulate gene activity and cell identity.

Abstract: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause cellular hyperproliferation-associated abnormalities including cervical cancer. The HPV genome encodes two major viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, which recruit various host proteins by direct interaction for proteasomal degradation. Recently, we reported the structure of HPV18 E7 conserved region 3 (CR3) bound to the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain of PTPN14, a well-defined tumor suppressor, and found that this intermolecular interaction plays a key role in E7-driven transformation and tumorigenesis. In this study, we carried out a molecular analysis of the interaction between CR3 of HPV18 E7 and the PTP domain of PTPN21, a PTP protein that shares high sequence homology with PTPN14 but is putatively oncogenic rather than tumor-suppressive. Through the combined use of biochemical tools, we verified that HPV18 E7 and PTPN21 form a 2:2 complex, with a dissociation constant of 5 nM and a nearly identical binding manner with the HPV18 E7 and PTPN14 complex. Nevertheless, despite the structural similarities, the biological consequences of the E7 interaction were found to differ between the two PTP proteins. Unlike PTPN14, PTPN21 did not appear to be subjected to proteasomal degradation in HPV18-positive HeLa cervical cancer cells. Moreover, knockdown of PTPN21 led to retardation of the migration/invasion of HeLa cells and HPV18 E7-expressing HaCaT keratinocytes, which reflects its protumor activity. In conclusion, the associations of the viral oncoprotein E7 with PTPN14 and PTPN21 are similar at the molecular level but play different physiological roles.

Abstract: Summary
The JAK/STAT1 pathway is generally activated by cytokines, providing essential antiviral defense. Here, we identify that STAT1 activation is independent of cytokines and JAKs at the early infection stage of some viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). Instead, STAT1 is activated mainly through spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) downstream of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I/mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (RIG-I/MAVS) signaling. Syk deletion profoundly impairs immediate innate immunity, as evidenced by the finding that Syk deletion attenuates tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and reduces the expressions of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in vitro and in vivo. The antiviral response to IAV infection is also significantly suppressed in the STAT1Y701F knockin mice. The results demonstrate that STAT1 activation is dependent on Syk rather than the cytokine-activated JAK signaling at the early stage of viral infection, which is critical for initial antiviral immunity. Our finding provides insights into the complicated mechanisms underlying host immune responses to viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
Protein kinases lie at the heart of cell-signaling processes and are often mutated in disease. Kinase target recognition at the active site is in part determined by a few amino acids around the phosphoacceptor residue. However, relatively little is known about how most preferences are encoded in the kinase sequence or how these preferences evolved. Here, we used alignment-based approaches to predict 30 specificity-determining residues (SDRs) for 16 preferences. These were studied with structural models and were validated by activity assays of mutant kinases. Cancer mutation data revealed that kinase SDRs are mutated more frequently than catalytic residues. We have observed that, throughout evolution, kinase specificity has been strongly conserved across orthologs but can diverge after gene duplication, as illustrated by the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family. The identified SDRs can be used to predict kinase specificity from sequence and aid in the interpretation of evolutionary or disease-related genomic variants.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue folding is a central building block of plant and animal morphogenesis. In dicotyledonous plants, hypocotyl folds to form hooks after seedling germination that protects their aerial stem cell niche during emergence from soil. Auxin response factors and auxin transport are reported to play a key role in this process. Here, we show that the microtubule-severing enzyme katanin contributes to hook formation. However, by exposing hypocotyls to external mechanical cues mimicking the natural soil environment, we reveal that auxin response factors ARF7/ARF19, auxin influx carriers, and katanin are dispensable for apical hook formation, indicating that these factors primarily play the role of catalyzers of tissue bending in the absence of external mechanical cues. Instead, our results reveal the key roles of the non-canonical TMK-mediated auxin pathway, PIN efflux carriers, and cellulose microfibrils as components of the core pathway behind hook formation in the presence or absence of external mechanical cues.

Abstract: Summary
Whereas the human fetal immune system is poised to generate immune tolerance and suppress inflammation in utero, an adult-like immune system emerges to orchestrate anti-pathogen immune responses in post-natal life. It has been posited that cells of the adult immune system arise as a discrete ontological “layer” of hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs) and their progeny; evidence supporting this model in humans has, however, been inconclusive. Here, we combine bulk and single-cell transcriptional profiling of lymphoid cells, myeloid cells, and HSPCs from fetal, perinatal, and adult developmental stages to demonstrate that the fetal-to-adult transition occurs progressively along a continuum of maturity—with a substantial degree of inter-individual variation at the time of birth—rather than via a transition between discrete waves. These findings have important implications for the design of strategies for prophylaxis against infection in the newborn and for the use of umbilical cord blood (UCB) in the setting of transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
While decades of research have elucidated many steps of the alphavirus lifecycle, the earliest replication dynamics have remained unclear. This missing time window has obscured early replicase strand-synthesis behavior and prevented elucidation of how the first events of infection might influence subsequent viral competition. Using quantitative live-cell and single-molecule imaging, we observed the initial replicase activity and its strand preferences in situ and measured the trajectory of replication over time. Under this quantitative framework, we investigated viral competition, where one alphavirus is able to exclude superinfection by a second homologous virus. We show that this appears as an indirect phenotypic consequence of a bidirectional competition between the two species, coupled with the rapid onset of viral replication and a limited total cellular carrying capacity. Together, these results emphasize the utility of analyzing viral kinetics within single cells.

Abstract: Summary
To date, the effects of specific modification types and sites on protein lifetime have not been systematically illustrated. Here, we describe a proteomic method, DeltaSILAC, to quantitatively assess the impact of site-specific phosphorylation on the turnover of thousands of proteins in live cells. Based on the accurate and reproducible mass spectrometry-based method, a pulse labeling approach using stable isotope-labeled amino acids in cells (pSILAC), phosphoproteomics, and a unique peptide-level matching strategy, our DeltaSILAC profiling revealed a global, unexpected delaying effect of many phosphosites on protein turnover. We further found that phosphorylated sites accelerating protein turnover are functionally selected for cell fitness, enriched in Cyclin-dependent kinase substrates, and evolutionarily conserved, whereas the glutamic acids surrounding phosphosites significantly delay protein turnover. Our method represents a generalizable approach and provides a rich resource for prioritizing the effects of phosphorylation sites on protein lifetime in the context of cell signaling and disease biology.

Abstract: The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is the master transcriptional regulator in adipogenesis. PPARγ forms a heterodimer with another nuclear receptor, retinoid X receptor (RXR), to form an active transcriptional complex, and their transcriptional activity is tightly regulated by the association with either coactivators or corepressors. In this study, we identified T-cell death-associated gene 51 (TDAG51) as a novel corepressor of PPARγ-mediated transcriptional regulation. We showed that TDAG51 expression is abundantly maintained in the early stage of adipogenic differentiation. Forced expression of TDAG51 inhibited adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. We found that TDAG51 physically interacts with PPARγ in a ligand-independent manner. In deletion mutant analyses, large portions of the TDAG51 domains, including the pleckstrin homology-like, glutamine repeat and proline-glutamine repeat domains but not the proline-histidine repeat domain, are involved in the interaction with the region between residues 140 and 506, including the DNA binding domain, hinge, ligand binding domain and activation function-2 domain, in PPARγ. The heterodimer formation of PPARγ-RXRα was competitively inhibited in a ligand-independent manner by TDAG51 binding to PPARγ. Thus, our data suggest that TDAG51, which could determine adipogenic cell fate, acts as a novel negative regulator of PPARγ by blocking RXRα recruitment to the PPARγ-RXRα heterodimer complex in adipogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic changes controlling the stepwise differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to mature erythrocytes are poorly understood. Here, we show that HSPC development to an erythroid-committed proerythroblast results in augmented glutaminolysis, generating alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) and driving mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). However, sequential late-stage erythropoiesis is dependent on decreasing αKG-driven OXPHOS, and we find that isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) plays a central role in this process. IDH1 downregulation augments mitochondrial oxidation of αKG and inhibits reticulocyte generation. Furthermore, IDH1 knockdown results in the generation of multinucleated erythroblasts, a morphological abnormality characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. We identify vitamin C homeostasis as a critical regulator of ineffective erythropoiesis; oxidized ascorbate increases mitochondrial superoxide and significantly exacerbates the abnormal erythroblast phenotype of IDH1-downregulated progenitors, whereas vitamin C, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism, rescues erythropoiesis. Thus, an IDH1-vitamin C crosstalk controls terminal steps of human erythroid differentiation.

Abstract: Dopamine is a neuromodulator and neurotransmitter responsible for a number of physiological processes. Dysfunctions of the dopamine metabolism and signalling are associated with neurological and psychiatric diseases. Here we report that in primary co-culture of neurons and astrocytes dopamine-induces calcium signal in astrocytes and suppress spontaneous synchronous calcium oscillations (SSCO) in neurons. Effect of dopamine on SSCO in neurons was dependent on calcium signal in astrocytes and could be modified by inhibition of dopamine-induced calcium signal or by stimulation of astrocytic calcium rise with ATP. Ability of dopamine to suppress SSCO in neurons was independent on D1- or D2- like receptors but dependent on GABA and alpha-adrenoreceptors. Inhibitor of monoaminoxidase bifemelane blocked effect of dopamine on astrocytes but also inhibited the effect dopamine on SSCO in neurons. These findings suggest that dopamine-induced calcium signal may stimulate release of neuromodulators such as GABA and adrenaline and thus suppress spontaneous calcium oscillations in neurons.

Abstract: Summary
The human genome harbors 14,000 duplicated or retroposed pseudogenes. Given their functionality as regulatory RNAs and low conservation, we hypothesized that pseudogenes could shape human-specific phenotypes. To test this, we performed co-expression analyses and found that pseudogene exhibited tissue-specific expression, especially in the bone marrow. By incorporating genetic data, we identified a bone-marrow-specific duplicated pseudogene, HBBP1 (η-globin), which has been implicated in β-thalassemia. Extensive functional assays demonstrated that HBBP1 is essential for erythropoiesis by binding the RNA-binding protein (RBP), HNRNPA1, to upregulate TAL1, a key regulator of erythropoiesis. The HBBP1/TAL1 interaction contributes to a milder symptom in β-thalassemia patients. Comparative studies further indicated that the HBBP1/TAL1 interaction is human-specific. Genome-wide analyses showed that duplicated pseudogenes are often bound by RBPs and less commonly bound by microRNAs compared with retropseudogenes. Taken together, we not only demonstrate that pseudogenes can drive human evolution but also provide insights on their functional landscapes.

Abstract: Summary
Riboswitches are thought generally to function by modulating transcription elongation or translation initiation. In rare instances, ligand binding to a riboswitch has been found to alter the rate of RNA degradation by directly stimulating or inhibiting nearby cleavage. Here, we show that guanidine-induced pseudoknot formation by the aptamer domain of a guanidine III riboswitch from Legionella pneumophila has a different effect, stabilizing mRNA by protecting distal cleavage sites en masse from ribonuclease attack. It does so by creating a coaxially base-paired obstacle that impedes scanning from a monophosphorylated 5′ end to those sites by the regulatory endonuclease RNase E. Ligand binding by other riboswitch aptamers peripheral to the path traveled by RNase E does not inhibit distal cleavage. These findings reveal that a riboswitch aptamer can function independently of any overlapping expression platform to regulate gene expression by acting directly to prolong mRNA longevity in response to ligand binding.

Abstract: Summary
STING-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing in dendritic cells (DCs) initiates antitumor immune responses, but how STING signaling is metabolically regulated in the tumor microenvironment remains unknown. Here, we show that oxidative stress is required for STING-induced DC antitumor function through a process that directs SUMO-specific protease 3 (SENP3) activity. DC-specific deletion of Senp3 drives tumor progression by blunting STING-dependent type-I interferon (IFN) signaling in DCs and dampening antitumor immune responses. DC-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger SENP3 accumulation and the SENP3-IFI204 interaction, thereby catalyzing IFI204 deSUMOylation and boosting STING signaling activation in mice. Consistently, SENP3 senses ROS to facilitate STING-dependent DC activity in tissue samples from colorectal cancer patients. Our results reveal that oxidative stress as a metabolic regulator promotes STING-mediated DC antitumor immune responses and highlights SENP3 as an overflow valve for STING signaling induction in the metabolically abnormal tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Neural network computations are usually assumed to emerge from patterns of fast electrical activity. Challenging this view, we show that a male fly’s decision to persist in mating hinges on a biochemical computation that enables processing over minutes to hours. Each neuron in a recurrent network contains slightly different internal molecular estimates of mating progress. Protein kinase A (PKA) activity contrasts this internal measurement with input from the other neurons to represent accumulated evidence that the goal of the network has been achieved. When consensus is reached, PKA pushes the network toward a large-scale and synchronized burst of calcium influx that we call an eruption. Eruptions transform continuous deliberation within the network into an all-or-nothing output, after which the male will no longer sacrifice his life to continue mating. Here, biochemical activity, invisible to most large-scale recording techniques, is the key computational currency directing behavior and motivational state.

Abstract: Summary
Micronuclei are aberrant nuclear compartments that can form as a result of chromosome mis-segregation. Frequent loss of micronuclear envelope integrity exposes DNA to the cytoplasm, leading to chromosome fragmentation and immune activation. Here, we use micronuclei purification to show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated nuclease TREX1 inhibits cGAS activation at micronuclei by degrading micronuclear DNA upon micronuclear envelope rupture. We demonstrate that the ER accesses ruptured micronuclei and plays a critical role in enabling TREX1 nucleolytic attack. TREX1 mutations, previously implicated in immune disease, untether TREX1 from the ER, disrupt TREX1 localization to micronuclei, diminish micronuclear DNA damage, and enhance cGAS activation. These results establish ER-directed resection of micronuclear DNA by TREX1 as a critical regulator of cytosolic DNA sensing in chromosomally unstable cells and provide a mechanistic basis for the importance of TREX1 ER tethering in preventing autoimmunity.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease associated with several intestinal disorders. S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide (SMCS) ​​is an amino acid present in Allium cepa L with hypoglycemic effects. However, the effects of SMCS on diabetic intestinal changes are unknown. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of SMCS on duodenal morphology and immunomodulatory markers in diabetic rats. Twenty-six rats were divided into three groups: control (C), diabetic (D) and diabetic +200 mg/kg SMCS (DSM). DM was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). After 30 days, duodenum samples were processed to assess histopathological and stereological alterations in volume, villus length, and immunohistochemical expression of NF-kB, IL-10, BCL-2, and caspase-3. SMCS reduced hyperglycemia and mitigated the increase in total reference volume of the duodenum, the absolute volume of the mucosa, and the length of the intestinal crypts in the DMS group when compared to D. IL-10 immunostaining was reduced in D when compared to C, while NF-kB was increased in D in comparison to the other groups. SMCS ​​supplementation could decrease the NF-kB immunostaining observed in D. Positive staining for BCL-2 and caspase-3 were not statistically different between groups. In summary, SMCS decreased hyperglycemia and mitigated the morphological changes of the duodenum in diabetic animals, and these beneficial effects can be partially explained by NF-kB modulation.

Abstract: Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) is a conserved protein that initiates the production of inositol phosphate intracellular messengers and is critical for regulating a variety of cellular processes. Here, we report that the C. elegans IPMK-1, which is homologous to the mammalian inositol polyphosphate multikinase, plays a crucial role in regulating rhythmic behavior and development. The deletion mutant ipmk-1(tm2687) displays a long defecation cycle period and retarded postembryonic growth. The expression of functional ipmk-1::GFP was detected in the pharyngeal muscles, amphid sheath cells, the intestine, excretory (canal) cells, proximal gonad, and spermatheca. The expression of IPMK-1 in the intestine was sufficient for the wild-type phenotype. The IP3-kinase activity of IPMK-1 is required for defecation rhythms and postembryonic development. The defective phenotypes of ipmk-1(tm2687) could be rescued by a loss-of-function mutation in type I inositol 5-phosphatase homolog (IPP-5) and improved by a supplemental Ca2+ in the medium. Our work demonstrates that IPMK-1 and the signaling molecule inositol triphosphate (IP3) pathway modulate rhythmic behaviors and development by dynamically regulating the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ in C. elegans. Advances in understanding the molecular regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis and regulation of organism development may lead to therapeutic strategies that modulate Ca2+ signaling to enhance function and counteract disease processes. Unraveling the physiological role of IPMK and the underlying functional mechanism in C. elegans would contribute to understanding the role of IPMK in other species, especially in mammals, and benefit further research on the involvement of IPMK in disease.

Abstract: Summary
A significant increase in dietary fructose consumption has been implicated as a potential driver of cancer. Metabolic adaptation of cancer cells to utilize fructose confers advantages for their malignant growth, but compelling therapeutic targets have not been identified. Here, we show that fructose metabolism of leukemic cells can be inhibited by targeting the de novo serine synthesis pathway (SSP). Leukemic cells, unlike their normal counterparts, become significantly dependent on the SSP in fructose-rich conditions as compared to glucose-rich conditions. This metabolic program is mediated by the ratio of redox cofactors, NAD+/NADH, and the increased SSP flux is beneficial for generating alpha-ketoglutarate from glutamine, which allows leukemic cells to proliferate even in the absence of glucose. Inhibition of PHGDH, a rate-limiting enzyme in the SSP, dramatically reduces leukemia engraftment in mice in the presence of high fructose, confirming the essential role of the SSP in the metabolic plasticity of leukemic cells.

Abstract: Cytosolic cAMP signalling in live cells has been extensively investigated in the past, while only in the last decade the existence of an intramitochondrial autonomous cAMP homeostatic system began to emerge. Thanks to the development of novel tools to investigate cAMP dynamics and cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation within the matrix and in other mitochondrial compartments, it is now possible to address directly and in intact living cells a series of questions that until now could be addressed only by indirect approaches, in isolated organelles or through subcellular fractionation studies. In this contribution we discuss the mechanisms that regulate cAMP dynamics at the surface and inside mitochondria, and its crosstalk with organelle Ca2+ handling. We then address a series of still unsolved questions, such as the intramitochondrial localization of key elements of the cAMP signaling toolkit, e.g., adenylate cyclases, phosphodiesterases, protein kinase A (PKA) and Epac. Finally, we discuss the evidence for and against the existence of an intramitochondrial PKA pool and the functional role of cAMP increases within the organelle matrix.

Abstract: Summary
Metazoan transcription factors typically regulate large numbers of genes. Here we identify via a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen ZNF410, a pentadactyl DNA-binding protein that in human erythroid cells directly activates only a single gene, the NuRD component CHD4. Specificity is conveyed by two highly evolutionarily conserved clusters of ZNF410 binding sites near the CHD4 gene with no counterparts elsewhere in the genome. Loss of ZNF410 in adult-type human erythroid cell culture systems and xenotransplantation settings diminishes CHD4 levels and derepresses the fetal hemoglobin genes. While previously known to be silenced by CHD4, the fetal globin genes are exposed here as among the most sensitive to reduced CHD4 levels. In vitro DNA binding assays and crystallographic studies reveal the ZNF410-DNA binding mode. ZNF410 is a remarkably selective transcriptional activator in erythroid cells, and its perturbation might offer new opportunities for treatment of hemoglobinopathies.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of cancer from diverse normal tissues has long been rationalized to represent a common set of fundamental processes. However, these processes are not fully defined. Here, we show that forced expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) affords immortalized mouse and human cells anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in animals. Mechanistically, G6PD augments the NADPH pool by stimulating NAD+ kinase-mediated NADP+ biosynthesis in addition to converting NADP+ to NADPH, bolstering antioxidant defense. G6PD also increases nucleotide precursor levels through the production of ribose and NADPH, promoting cell proliferation. Supplementation of antioxidants or nucleosides suffices to convert immortalized mouse and human cells into a tumorigenic state, and supplementation of both is required when their overlapping metabolic consequences are minimized. These results suggest that normal cells have a limited capacity for redox balance and nucleotide synthesis, and overcoming this limit might represent a key aspect of oncogenic transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) has a pathophysiological role in obesity-associated insulin resistance. Yet, the coordinated tissue response to ERS remains unclear. Increased connexin 43 (Cx43)-mediated intercellular communication has been implicated in tissue-adaptive and -maladaptive response to various chronic stresses. Here, we demonstrate that in hepatocytes, ERS results in increased Cx43 expression and cell-cell coupling. Co-culture of ER-stressed “donor” cells resulted in intercellular transmission of ERS and dysfunction to ERS-naive “recipient” cells (“bystander response”), which could be prevented by genetic or pharmacologic suppression of Cx43. Hepatocytes from obese mice were able to transmit ERS to hepatocytes from lean mice, and mice lacking liver Cx43 were protected from diet-induced ERS, insulin resistance, and hepatosteatosis. Taken together, our results indicate that in obesity, the increased Cx43-mediated cell-cell coupling allows intercellular propagation of ERS. This novel maladaptive response to over-nutrition exacerbates the tissue ERS burden, promoting hepatosteatosis and impairing whole-body glucose metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
In response to cold exposure, thermogenic adipocytes internalize large amounts of fatty acids after lipoprotein lipase-mediated hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) in the capillary lumen of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT). Here, we show that in cold-exposed mice, vascular endothelial cells in adipose tissues endocytose substantial amounts of entire TRL particles. These lipoproteins subsequently follow the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, where they undergo lysosomal acid lipase (LAL)-mediated processing. Endothelial cell-specific LAL deficiency results in impaired thermogenic capacity as a consequence of reduced recruitment of brown and brite/beige adipocytes. Mechanistically, TRL processing by LAL induces proliferation of endothelial cells and adipocyte precursors via beta-oxidation-dependent production of reactive oxygen species, which in turn stimulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-dependent proliferative responses. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a physiological role for TRL particle uptake into BAT and WAT and establishes endothelial lipoprotein processing as an important determinant of adipose tissue remodeling during thermogenic adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
Immune cells can metabolize glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids (FAs) to generate energy. The roles of different FA species and their impacts on humoral immunity remain poorly understood. Here, we report that proliferating B cells require monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) to maintain mitochondrial metabolism and mTOR activity and to prevent excessive autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Furthermore, B cell-extrinsic stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) activity generates MUFA to support early B cell development and germinal center (GC) formation in vivo during immunization and influenza infection. Thus, SCD-mediated MUFA production is critical for humoral immunity.

Abstract: Apoptosis and compensatory proliferation, two intertwined cellular processes essential for both development and adult homeostasis, are often initiated by the mis-regulation of centrosomal proteins, damaged DNA, and defects in mitosis. Fly Anastral spindle 3 (Ana3) is a member of the pericentriolar matrix proteins and known as a key component of centriolar cohesion and basal body formation. We report here that ana3m19 is a suppressor of lethality induced by the overexpression of Sol narae (Sona), a metalloprotease in a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motif (ADAMTS) family. ana3m19 has a nonsense mutation that truncates the highly conserved carboxyl terminal region containing multiple Armadillo repeats. Lethality induced by Sona overexpression was completely rescued by knockdown of Ana3, and the small and malformed wing and hinge phenotype induced by the knockdown of Ana3 was also normalized by Sona overexpression, establishing a mutually positive genetic interaction between ana3 and sona. p35 inhibited apoptosis and rescued the small wing and hinge phenotype induced by knockdown of ana3. Furthermore, overexpression of Ana3 increased the survival rate of irradiated flies and reduced the number of dying cells, demonstrating that Ana3 actively promotes cell survival. Knockdown of Ana3 decreased the levels of both intra- and extracellular Sona in wing discs, while overexpression of Ana3 in S2 cells dramatically increased the levels of both cytoplasmic and exosomal Sona due to the stabilization of Sona in the lysosomal degradation pathway. We propose that one of the main functions of Ana3 is to stabilize Sona for cell survival and proliferation.

Abstract: Objectives
This study aimed to analyze the effect of whole-body vibration (WBV) on metabolic parameters using the monosodium l-glutamate (MSG) model of obesity.
Method
MSG-obese rats that were exposed to WBV on a vibrating platform with 60 Hz frequency, 2 mm amplitude, three times/week, 10 min/day, during eight weeks (from postnatal day (PN) 80 to PN136). Blood glucose, creatine kinases (CK and CK-MB) and lipid profile through plasma and liver levels of lipids and lipoproteins were evaluated. Morphology and oxidative stress of adipose and hepatic tissues were further evaluated.
Results
When performing a WBV exercise, animals showed contrasting metabolic responses. Vibration Control group (CTL-WBV) presented a reduction in CK and liver triacylglycerol, an increase in glucose, lactate, total cholesterol, liver cholesterol, and LDL while MSG Vibration group (MSG-WBV) showed an increase in total triacylglycerol, VLDL, lactate, CK, liver cholesterol, additional liver lipid peroxidation and LDL, total cholesterol and CKMB reduction.
Conclusion
Even although the MSG is a model of impacting injury, the metabolic demand of WBV exercise was able to induce mobilization of substrates, highlighting the lipid mobilization in obese animals, it should be used as a metabolic rehabilitation tool in patients with metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a deadly cancer characterized by complex metabolic adaptations that promote survival in a severely hypoxic and nutrient-limited tumor microenvironment (TME). Modeling microenvironmental influences in cell culture has been challenging, and technical limitations have hampered the comprehensive study of tumor-specific metabolism in vivo. To systematically interrogate metabolic vulnerabilities in PDA, we employed parallel CRISPR-Cas9 screens using in vivo and in vitro systems. This work revealed striking overlap of in vivo metabolic dependencies with those in vitro. Moreover, we identified that intercellular nutrient sharing can mask dependencies in pooled screens, highlighting a limitation of this approach to study tumor metabolism. Furthermore, metabolic dependencies were similar between 2D and 3D culture, although 3D culture may better model vulnerabilities that influence certain oncogenic signaling pathways. Lastly, our work demonstrates the power of genetic screening approaches to define in vivo metabolic dependencies and pathways that may have therapeutic utility.

Abstract: Summary
N-terminal (Nt) acetylation is a highly prevalent co-translational protein modification in eukaryotes, catalyzed by at least five Nt acetyltransferases (Nats) with differing specificities. Nt acetylation has been implicated in protein quality control, but its broad biological significance remains elusive. We investigate the roles of the two major Nats of S. cerevisiae, NatA and NatB, by performing transcriptome, translatome, and proteome profiling of natAΔ and natBΔ mutants. Our results reveal a range of NatA- and NatB-specific phenotypes. NatA is implicated in systemic adaptation control, because natAΔ mutants display altered expression of transposons, sub-telomeric genes, pheromone response genes, and nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. NatB predominantly affects protein folding, because natBΔ mutants, to a greater extent than natA mutants, accumulate protein aggregates, induce stress responses, and display reduced fitness in the absence of the ribosome-associated chaperone Ssb. These phenotypic differences indicate that controlling Nat activities may serve to elicit distinct cellular responses.

Abstract: Summary
Histone acetylation levels are regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) that antagonistically control the overall balance of this post-translational modification. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are potent agents that disrupt this balance and are used clinically to treat diseases including cancer. Despite their use, little is known about their effects on chromatin regulators, particularly those that signal through lysine acetylation. We apply quantitative genomic and proteomic approaches to demonstrate that HDACi robustly increases a low-abundance histone 4 polyacetylation state, which serves as a preferred binding substrate for several bromodomain-containing proteins, including BRD4. Increased H4 polyacetylation occurs in transcribed genes and correlates with the targeting of BRD4. Collectively, these results suggest that HDAC inhibition functions, at least in part, through expansion of a rare histone acetylation state, which then retargets lysine-acetyl readers associated with changes in gene expression, partially mimicking the effect of bromodomain inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
The development of mouse embryos can be partially recapitulated by combining embryonic stem cells (ESCs), trophoblast stem cells (TS), and extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN) stem cells to generate embryo-like structures called ETX embryos. Although ETX embryos transcriptionally capture the mouse gastrula, their ability to recapitulate complex morphogenic events such as gastrulation is limited, possibly due to the limited potential of XEN cells. To address this, we generated ESCs transiently expressing transcription factor Gata4, which drives the extra-embryonic endoderm fate, and combined them with ESCs and TS cells to generate induced ETX embryos (iETX embryos). We show that iETX embryos establish a robust anterior signaling center that migrates unilaterally to break embryo symmetry. Furthermore, iETX embryos gastrulate generating embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm and definitive endoderm. Our findings reveal that replacement of XEN cells with ESCs transiently expressing Gata4 endows iETX embryos with greater developmental potential, thus enabling the study of the establishment of anterior-posterior patterning and gastrulation in an in vitro system.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis is a form of necrotic cell death caused by iron-dependent peroxidation of polyunsaturated phospholipids on cell membranes and is actively suppressed by the cellular antioxidant systems. We report here that oxidoreductases, including NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R1), transfer electrons from NAD(P)H to oxygen to generate hydrogen peroxide, which subsequently reacts with iron to generate reactive hydroxyl radicals for the peroxidation of the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) chains of membrane phospholipids, thereby disrupting membrane integrity during ferroptosis. Genetic knockout of POR and CYB5R1 decreases cellular hydrogen peroxide generation, preventing lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Moreover, POR knockdown in mouse liver prevents ConA-induced liver damage. Ferroptosis, therefore, is a result of incidental electron transfer carried out by POR/CYB5R1 oxidoreductase and thus needs to be constitutively countered by the antioxidant systems.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumor malignancy, but the precise transcriptional mechanisms regulating the acquisition of the CAF phenotype are not well understood. We show that the upregulation of SOX2 is central to this process, which is repressed by protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ). PKCζ deficiency activates the reprogramming of colonic fibroblasts to generate a predominant SOX2-dependent CAF population expressing the WNT regulator Sfrp2 as its top biomarker. SOX2 directly binds the Sfrp1/2 promoters, and the inactivation of Sox2 or Sfrp1/2 in CAFs impaired the induction of migration and invasion of colon cancer cells, as well as their tumorigenicity in vivo. Importantly, recurrence-free and overall survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients negatively correlates with stromal PKCζ levels. Also, SOX2 expression in the stroma is associated with CRC T invasion and worse prognosis of recurrence-free survival. Therefore, the PKCζ-SOX2 axis emerges as a critical step in the control of CAF pro-tumorigenic potential.

Abstract: Summary
Replication fork reversal is a global response to replication stress in mammalian cells, but precisely how it occurs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that, upon replication stress, DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) is recruited to stalled forks in a manner dependent on the SNF2-family DNA translocases HLTF, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1. This is accompanied by an increase in TOP2A SUMOylation mediated by the SUMO E3 ligase ZATT and followed by recruitment of a SUMO-targeted DNA translocase, PICH. Disruption of the ZATT-TOP2A-PICH axis results in accumulation of partially reversed forks and enhanced genome instability. These results suggest that fork reversal occurs via a sequential two-step process. First, HLTF, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1 initiate limited fork reversal, creating superhelical strain in the newly replicated sister chromatids. Second, TOP2A drives extensive fork reversal by resolving the resulting topological barriers and via its role in recruiting PICH to stalled forks.
