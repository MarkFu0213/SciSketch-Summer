Abstract: Summary
Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are a rare subpopulation of abnormal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that propagates leukemia and are responsible for the high frequency of relapse in therapies. Detailed insights into LSCs’ survival will facilitate the identification of targets for therapeutic approaches. Here, we develop an inhibitor, LYZ-81, which targets ORP4L with high affinity and specificity and selectively eradicates LCSs in vitro and in vivo. ORP4L is expressed in LSCs but not in normal HSCs and is essential for LSC bioenergetics and survival. It extracts PIP2 from the plasma membrane and presents it to PLCβ3, enabling IP3 generation and subsequent Ca2+-dependent bioenergetics. LYZ-81 binds ORP4L competitively with PIP2 and blocks PIP2 hydrolysis, resulting in defective Ca2+ signaling. The results provide evidence that LSCs can be eradicated through the inhibition of ORP4L by LYZ-81, which may serve as a starting point of drug development for the elimination of LSCs to eventually cure leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
The role of non-classical T cells during viral infection remains poorly understood. Using the well-established murine model of CMV infection (MCMV) and mice deficient in MHC class Ia molecules, we found that non-classical CD8+ T cells robustly expand after MCMV challenge, become highly activated effectors, and are capable of forming durable memory. Interestingly, although these cells are restricted by MHC class Ib molecules, they respond similarly to conventional T cells. Remarkably, when acting as the sole component of the adaptive immune response, non-classical CD8+ T cells are sufficient to protect against MCMV-induced lethality. We also demonstrate that the MHC class Ib molecule Qa-1 (encoded by H2-T23) restricts a large, and critical, portion of this population. These findings reveal a potential adaptation of the host immune response to compensate for viral evasion of classical T cell immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Preventing inappropriate gene expression in time and space is as fundamental as triggering the activation of tissue- or cell-type-specific factors at the correct developmental stage and in the correct cells. Here, we study the impact of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) function on HoxA gene regulation. We analyze chromatin conformation of the HoxA cluster and its regulatory regions and show that in addition to the well-known role of PRC2 in silencing Hox genes via direct binding, its function is required for the changes in HoxA long-range interactions distinguishing proximal limbs from distal limbs. This effect stems from the differential PRC2 occupancy over the HoxA cluster and, at least in part, from the ability of PRC2-bound loci to engage in long-range contacts. Unexpectedly, PRC2 also impacts chromatin conformation in a way that promotes enhancer-promoter contacts required for proper HoxA expression, pointing to a dual role of PRC2 in gene regulation.

Abstract: A number of studies have indicated the benefits of coffee consumption on physical and mental health; however, scientific evidence on these effects, in particular of the benefits to brain function, has not been determined. In the present study, we aimed to determine the benefits of caffeic acid in the nervous system. For this purpose, we administered doses of 0 or 300 mg/kg for 30 days to mice that were not otherwise affected. We analyzed survival of newly born cells, oxidative stress, inflammatory marker expression, and microglial activation in the hippocampus. We found that caffeic acid had no effect on the expression levels of neurotrophic factors and inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines. However, caffeic acid-treated mice exhibited significantly lower levels of 4-hydroxynonenal, an oxidative stress marker, in the hippocampus, as well as significantly fewer activated microglia. Abnormally high oxidative stress, as well as activated microglia accumulation are both considered to relate to the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The present study demonstrates the physiological effects of caffeic acid and may explain the suggested benefits of coffee consumption on brain health.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidation of the sequence of events underlying the dynamic interaction between transcription factors and chromatin states is essential. Maternal transcription factors function at the top of the regulatory hierarchy to specify the primary germ layers at the onset of zygotic genome activation (ZGA). We focus on the formation of endoderm progenitor cells and examine the interactions between maternal transcription factors and chromatin state changes underlying the cell specification process. Endoderm-specific factors Otx1 and Vegt together with Foxh1 orchestrate endoderm formation by coordinated binding to select regulatory regions. These interactions occur before the deposition of enhancer histone marks around the regulatory regions, and these TFs recruit RNA polymerase II, regulate enhancer activity, and establish super-enhancers associated with important endodermal genes. Therefore, maternal transcription factors Otx1, Vegt, and Foxh1 combinatorially regulate the activity of super-enhancers, which in turn activate key lineage-specifying genes during ZGA.

Abstract: Summary
Systematic measurement biases make normalization an essential step in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. There may be multiple competing considerations behind the assessment of normalization performance, of which some may be study specific. We have developed “scone”— a flexible framework for assessing performance based on a comprehensive panel of data-driven metrics. Through graphical summaries and quantitative reports, scone summarizes trade-offs and ranks large numbers of normalization methods by panel performance. The method is implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R software package scone. We show that top-performing normalization methods lead to better agreement with independent validation data for a collection of scRNA-seq datasets. scone can be downloaded at http://bioconductor.org/packages/scone/.

Abstract: Summary
The precursor cells for metabolically beneficial beige adipocytes can alternatively become fibrogenic and contribute to adipose fibrosis. We found that cold exposure or β3-adrenergic agonist treatment of mice decreased the fibrogenic profile of precursor cells and stimulated beige adipocyte differentiation. This fibrogenic-to-adipogenic transition was impaired in aged animals, correlating with reduced adipocyte expression of the transcription factor PRDM16. Genetic loss of Prdm16 mimicked the effect of aging in promoting fibrosis, whereas increasing PRDM16 in aged mice decreased fibrosis and restored beige adipose development. PRDM16-expressing adipose cells secreted the metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which blocked precursor fibrogenesis and facilitated beige adipogenesis. BHB catabolism in precursor cells, mediated by BDH1, was required for beige fat differentiation in vivo. Finally, dietary BHB supplementation in aged animals reduced adipose fibrosis and promoted beige fat formation. Together, our results demonstrate that adipocytes secrete a metabolite signal that controls beige fat remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Cells with complex aneuploidies display a wide range of phenotypic abnormalities. However, the molecular basis for this has been mainly studied in trisomic (2n + 1) and disomic (n + 1) cells. To determine how karyotype affects proliferation in cells with complex aneuploidies, we generated 92 2n + x yeast strains in which each diploid cell has between 3 and 12 extra chromosomes. Genome-wide and, for individual protein complexes, proliferation defects are caused by the presence of protein complexes in which all subunits are balanced at the 3-copy level. Proteomics revealed that over 50% of 3-copy members of imbalanced complexes were expressed at only 2n protein levels, whereas members of complexes in which all subunits are stoichiometrically balanced at 3 copies per cell had 3n protein levels. We validated this finding using orthogonal datasets from yeast and from human cancers. Taken together, our study provides an explanation of how aneuploidy affects phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) control cell identity by establishing facultative heterochromatin repressive domains at common sets of target genes. PRC1, which deposits H2Aub1 through the E3 ligases RING1A/B, forms six biochemically distinct subcomplexes depending on the assembled PCGF protein (PCGF1–PCGF6); however, it is yet unclear whether these subcomplexes have also specific activities. Here we show that PCGF1 and PCGF2 largely compensate for each other, while other PCGF proteins have high levels of specificity for distinct target genes. PCGF2 associates with transcription repression, whereas PCGF3 and PCGF6 associate with actively transcribed genes. Notably, PCGF3 and PCGF6 complexes can assemble and be recruited to several active sites independently of RING1A/B activity (therefore, of PRC1). For chromatin recruitment, the PCGF6 complex requires the combinatorial activities of its MGA-MAX and E2F6-DP1 subunits, while PCGF3 requires an interaction with the USF1 DNA binding transcription factor.

Abstract: Summary
The segregation of chromosomes is a critical step during cell division. This process is driven by the elongation of spindle microtubules and is tightly regulated by checkpoint mechanisms. It is unknown whether microtubules affect checkpoint responses as passive contributors or active regulators of the process. We show here that interphase microtubules are essential to temporally restrict the effects of DNA replication stress to S phase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Tubulin mutants hypersensitive to DNA damage experience a strong but delayed mitotic checkpoint arrest after exposure to genotoxic stress in S phase. This untimely arrest is dependent on the Aurora B kinase but, surprisingly, not on the DNA damage checkpoint. Impaired microtubule-kinetochore interaction is the apparent cause for this unusual phenotype. Collectively, our results reveal that core components of microtubules potentiate the detection of DNA lesions created in S phase, thereby suppressing untimely activation of mitotic checkpoints after DNA replication stress.

Abstract: Summary
Horizontal transmission of the microbiota between different individuals is widely used to normalize the microbiota in laboratory mice. However, little is known about the dynamics of microbial communities and the level of microbiota transmission after cohousing. We extensively analyzed the fecal microbiota in Jackson and Taconic C57BL/6 mice to study horizontal transmission after weaning. Changes in the microbiota were clearly detected on day 3, almost plateaued on day 7, and resulted in near-comparable composition by day 28 after cohousing. Notably, the transmission of bacterial species was asymmetric in kinetics and abundance, resulting in a microbiota that is more similar to that of Jackson mice than Taconic. Several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) increased their abundance rapidly after cohousing in Taconic mice whereas several OTUs including two mucus-associated bacteria increased their abundance with delayed kinetics in Jackson mice. These studies provide insight into the dynamics and normalization of the microbiota during horizontal transmission.

Abstract: Summary
Cells are subjected to oxidative stress during the initiation and progression of tumors, and this imposes selective pressure for cancer cells to adapt mechanisms to tolerate these conditions. Here, we examined the dependency of cancer cells on glutathione (GSH), the most abundant cellular antioxidant. While cancer cell lines displayed a broad range of sensitivities to inhibition of GSH synthesis, the majority were resistant to GSH depletion. To identify cellular pathways required for this resistance, we carried out genetic and pharmacologic screens. Both approaches revealed that inhibition of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) sensitizes cancer cells to GSH depletion. Inhibition of GSH synthesis, in combination with DUB inhibition, led to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, induction of proteotoxic stress, and cell death. These results indicate that depletion of GSH renders cancer cells dependent on DUB activity to maintain protein homeostasis and cell viability and reveal a potentially exploitable vulnerability for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor FOXM1 contributes to cell cycle progression and is significantly upregulated in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC). Despite its importance in normal and cancer cell cycles, we lack a complete understanding of mechanisms that regulate FOXM1. We identified USP21 in an RNAi-based screen for deubiquitinases that control FOXM1 abundance. USP21 increases the stability of FOXM1, and USP21 binds and deubiquitinates FOXM1 in vivo and in vitro, indicating a direct enzyme-substrate relationship. Depleting USP21 downregulates the FOXM1 transcriptional network and causes a significant delay in cell cycle progression. Significantly, USP21 depletion sensitized BLBC cell lines and mouse xenograft tumors to paclitaxel, an anti-mitotic, frontline therapy in BLBC treatment. USP21 is the most frequently amplified deubiquitinase in BLBC patient tumors, and its amplification co-occurs with the upregulation of FOXM1 protein. Altogether, these data suggest a role for USP21 in the proliferation and potentially treatment of FOXM1-high, USP21-high BLBC.

Abstract: Summary
Multimeric adaptors are broadly involved in vesicle-mediated membrane trafficking. AP2 adaptor, in particular, plays a central role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) by recruiting cargo and clathrin to endocytic sites. It is generally thought that trafficking adaptors such as AP2 adaptor assemble spontaneously. In this work, however, we discovered that AP2 adaptor assembly is an ordered process controlled by alpha and gamma adaptin binding protein (AAGAB), an uncharacterized factor identified in our genome-wide genetic screen of CME. AAGAB guides the sequential association of AP2 subunits and stabilizes assembly intermediates. Without the assistance of AAGAB, AP2 subunits fail to form the adaptor complex, leading to their degradation. The function of AAGAB is abrogated by a mutation that causes punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type 1 (PPKP1), a human skin disease. Since other multimeric trafficking adaptors operate in an analogous manner to AP2 adaptor, their assembly likely involves a similar regulatory mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is susceptible to wear-and-tear and proteotoxic stress, necessitating its turnover. Here, we show that the N-degron pathway mediates ER-phagy. This autophagic degradation initiates when the transmembrane E3 ligase TRIM13 (also known as RFP2) is ubiquitinated via the lysine 63 (K63) linkage. K63-ubiquitinated TRIM13 recruits p62 (also known as sequestosome-1), whose complex undergoes oligomerization. The oligomerization is induced when the ZZ domain of p62 is bound by the N-terminal arginine (Nt-Arg) of arginylated substrates. Upon activation by the Nt-Arg, oligomerized TRIM13-p62 complexes are separated along with the ER compartments and targeted to autophagosomes, leading to lysosomal degradation. When protein aggregates accumulate within the ER lumen, degradation-resistant autophagic cargoes are co-segregated by ER membranes for lysosomal degradation. We developed synthetic ligands to the p62 ZZ domain that enhance ER-phagy for ER protein quality control and alleviate ER stresses. Our results elucidate the biochemical mechanisms and pharmaceutical means that regulate ER homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Tricellular adherens junctions are points of high tension that are central to the rearrangement of epithelial cells. However, the molecular composition of these junctions is unknown, making it difficult to assess their role in morphogenesis. Here, we show that Sidekick, an immunoglobulin family cell adhesion protein, is highly enriched at tricellular adherens junctions in Drosophila. This localization is modulated by tension, and Sidekick is itself necessary to maintain normal levels of cell bond tension. Loss of Sidekick causes defects in cell and junctional rearrangements in actively remodeling epithelial tissues like the retina and tracheal system. The adaptor proteins Polychaetoid and Canoe are enriched at tricellular adherens junctions in a Sidekick-dependent manner; Sidekick functionally interacts with both proteins and directly binds to Polychaetoid. We suggest that Polychaetoid and Canoe link Sidekick to the actin cytoskeleton to enable tricellular adherens junctions to maintain or transmit cell bond tension during epithelial cell rearrangements.

Abstract: Summary
The glymphatic system is a highly polarized cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport system that facilitates the clearance of neurotoxic molecules through a brain-wide network of perivascular pathways. Herein we have mapped the development of the glymphatic system in mice. Perivascular CSF transport first emerges in hippocampus in newborn mice, and a mature glymphatic system is established in the cortex at 2 weeks of age. Formation of astrocytic endfeet and polarized expression of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) consistently coincided with the appearance of perivascular CSF transport. Deficiency of platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) function in the PDGF retention motif knockout mouse line Pdgfbret/ret suppressed the development of the glymphatic system, whose functions remained suppressed in adulthood compared with wild-type mice. These experiments map the natural development of the glymphatic system in mice and define a critical role of PDGF-B in the development of perivascular CSF transport.

Abstract: Summary
The stringent response alarmones pppGpp and ppGpp are essential for rapid adaption of bacterial physiology to changes in the environment. In Escherichia coli, the nucleosidase PpnN (YgdH) regulates purine homeostasis by cleaving nucleoside monophosphates and specifically binds (p)ppGpp. Here, we show that (p)ppGpp stimulates the catalytic activity of PpnN both in vitro and in vivo causing accumulation of several types of nucleobases during stress. The structure of PpnN reveals a tetramer with allosteric (p)ppGpp binding sites located between subunits. pppGpp binding triggers a large conformational change that shifts the two terminal domains to expose the active site, providing a structural rationale for the stimulatory effect. We find that PpnN increases fitness and adjusts cellular tolerance to antibiotics and propose a model in which nucleotide levels can rapidly be adjusted during stress by simultaneous inhibition of biosynthesis and stimulation of degradation, thus achieving a balanced physiological response to constantly changing environments.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) must transition through a series of intermediate cell states before becoming terminally differentiated. Here, we investigated the early events in this transition by determining the changes in the open chromatin landscape as naive mouse ESCs transition to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs). Motif enrichment analysis of the newly opening regions coupled with expression analysis identified ZIC3 as a potential regulator of this cell fate transition. Chromatin binding and genome-wide transcriptional profiling following Zic3 depletion confirmed ZIC3 as an important regulatory transcription factor, and among its targets are genes encoding a number of transcription factors. Among these is GRHL2, which acts through enhancer switching to maintain the expression of a subset of genes from the ESC state. Our data therefore place ZIC3 upstream of a set of pro-differentiation transcriptional regulators and provide an important advance in our understanding of the regulatory factors governing the early steps in ESC differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an age-related disease. Although changes in function and proliferation of aged β cells resemble those preceding the development of diabetes, the contribution of β cell aging and senescence remains unclear. We generated a β cell senescence signature and found that insulin resistance accelerates β cell senescence leading to loss of function and cellular identity and worsening metabolic profile. Senolysis (removal of senescent cells), using either a transgenic INK-ATTAC model or oral ABT263, improved glucose metabolism and β cell function while decreasing expression of markers of aging, senescence, and senescence-associated secretory profile (SASP). Beneficial effects of senolysis were observed in an aging model as well as with insulin resistance induced both pharmacologically (S961) and physiologically (high-fat diet). Human senescent β cells also responded to senolysis, establishing the foundation for translation. These novel findings lay the framework to pursue senolysis of β cells as a preventive and alleviating strategy for T2D.

Abstract: Summary
Cotranslational processing of newly synthesized proteins is fundamental for correct protein maturation. Protein biogenesis factors are thought to bind nascent polypeptides not before they exit the ribosomal tunnel. Here, we identify a nascent chain recognition mechanism deep inside the ribosomal tunnel by an essential eukaryotic cytosolic chaperone. The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) inserts the N-terminal tail of its β subunit (N-βNAC) into the ribosomal tunnel to sense substrates directly upon synthesis close to the peptidyl-transferase center. N-βNAC escorts the growing polypeptide to the cytosol and relocates to an alternate binding site on the ribosomal surface. Using C. elegans as an in vivo model, we demonstrate that the tunnel-probing activity of NAC is essential for organismal viability and critical to regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein transport by controlling ribosome-Sec61 translocon interactions. Thus, eukaryotic protein maturation relies on the early sampling of nascent chains inside the ribosomal tunnel.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms that control aging are important yet poorly defined. To discover longevity control genes, we performed a forward genetic screen for delayed reproductive aging in C. elegans. Here, we show that am117 is a nonsense mutation in the phm-2 gene, which encodes a protein homologous to human scaffold attachment factor B. phm-2(lf) mutant worms have an abnormal pharynx grinder, which allows live bacteria to accumulate in the intestine. This defect shortens lifespan on highly pathogenic bacteria but extends lifespan and health span on the standard E. coli diet by activating innate immunity pathways that lead to bacterial avoidance behavior and dietary restriction. eat-2(lf) mutants displayed a similar phenotype, indicating accumulation of live bacteria also triggers extended longevity in this mutant. The analysis of phm-2 elucidates connections between pathogen response and aging by defining a mechanism of longevity extension in C. elegans—bacterial colonization, innate immune activation, and bacterial avoidance behavior.

Abstract: Summary
The essential histone H3 lysine 79 methyltransferase Dot1L regulates transcription and genomic stability and is deregulated in leukemia. The activity of Dot1L is stimulated by mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B on lysine 120 (H2BK120Ub); however, the detailed mechanism is not understood. We report cryo-EM structures of human Dot1L bound to (1) H2BK120Ub and (2) unmodified nucleosome substrates at 3.5 Å and 4.9 Å, respectively. Comparison of both structures, complemented with biochemical experiments, provides critical insights into the mechanism of Dot1L stimulation by H2BK120Ub. Both structures show Dot1L binding to the same extended surface of the histone octamer. In yeast, this surface is used by silencing proteins involved in heterochromatin formation, explaining the mechanism of their competition with Dot1. These results provide a strong foundation for understanding conserved crosstalk between histone modifications found at actively transcribed genes and offer a general model of how ubiquitin might regulate the activity of chromatin enzymes.

Abstract: Summary
Meiosis produces gametes through a specialized, two-step cell division, which is highly error prone in humans. Reductional meiosis I, where maternal and paternal chromosomes (homologs) segregate, is followed by equational meiosis II, where sister chromatids separate. Uniquely during meiosis I, sister kinetochores are monooriented and pericentromeric cohesin is protected. Here, we demonstrate that these key adaptations for reductional chromosome segregation are achieved through separable control of multiple kinases by the meiosis-I-specific budding yeast Spo13 protein. Recruitment of Polo kinase to kinetochores directs monoorientation, while independently, cohesin protection is achieved by containing the effects of cohesin kinases. Therefore, reductional chromosome segregation, the defining feature of meiosis, is established by multifaceted kinase control by a master regulator. The recent identification of Spo13 orthologs, fission yeast Moa1 and mouse MEIKIN, suggests that kinase coordination by a meiosis I regulator may be a general feature in the establishment of reductional chromosome segregation.

Abstract: Summary
Abnormal processing of stressed replication forks by nucleases can cause fork collapse, genomic instability, and cell death. Despite its importance, it is poorly understood how the cell properly controls nucleases to prevent detrimental fork processing. Here, we report a signaling pathway that controls the activity of exonuclease Exo1 to prevent aberrant fork resection during replication stress. Our results indicate that replication stress elevates intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), leading to activation of CaMKK2 and the downstream kinase 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Following activation, AMPK directly phosphorylates Exo1 at serine 746 to promote 14-3-3 binding and inhibit Exo1 recruitment to stressed replication forks, thereby avoiding unscheduled fork resection. Disruption of this signaling pathway results in excessive ssDNA, chromosomal instability, and hypersensitivity to replication stress inducers. These findings reveal a link between [Ca2+]i and the replication stress response as well as a function of the Ca2+-CaMKK2-AMPK signaling axis in safeguarding fork structure to maintain genome stability.

Abstract: Summary
The statistical complexity of heredity has long been evident, but its molecular origins remain elusive. To investigate, we charted 90 comprehensive genotype-to-phenotype maps in a large population of wild diploid yeast. In contrast to long-standing assumptions, all types of genetic variation contributed similarly to phenotype. Causal synonymous and regulatory variants exhibited distinct molecular signatures, as did nonlinearities in heterozygote fitness that likely contribute to hybrid vigor. Highly pleiotropic variants altered disordered sequences within signaling hubs, and their effects correlated across environments—even when antagonistic—suggesting that large fitness gains bring concomitant costs. Natural genetic networks defined by the causal loci differed from those determined by precise gene deletions or protein-protein interactions. Finally, we found that traits that would appear omnigenic in less powered studies do in fact have finite genetic determinants. Integrating these molecular principles will be crucial as genome reading and writing become routine in research, industry, and medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Alterations in chromatin remodeling genes have been increasingly implicated in human oncogenesis. Specifically, the biallelic inactivation of the SWI/SNF subunit SMARCB1 results in the emergence of extremely aggressive pediatric malignancies. Here, we developed embryonic mosaic mouse models of malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) that faithfully recapitulate the clinical-pathological features of the human disease. We demonstrated that SMARCB1-deficient malignancies exhibit dramatic activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER stress response via a genetically intact MYC-p19ARF-p53 axis. As a consequence, these tumors display an exquisite sensitivity to agents inducing proteotoxic stress and inhibition of the autophagic machinery. In conclusion, our findings provide a rationale for drug repositioning trials investigating combinations of agents targeting the UPR and autophagy in SMARCB1-deficient MRTs.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal waves, the spontaneous patterned neural activities propagating among developing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), instruct the activity-dependent refinement of visuotopic maps. Although it is known that the wave is initiated successively by amacrine cells and bipolar cells, the behavior and function of glia in retinal waves remain unclear. Using multiple in vivo methods in larval zebrafish, we found that Müller glial cells (MGCs) display wave-like spontaneous activities, which start at MGC processes within the inner plexiform layer, vertically spread to their somata and endfeet, and horizontally propagate into neighboring MGCs. MGC waves depend on glutamatergic signaling derived from bipolar cells. Moreover, MGCs express both glia-specific glutamate transporters and the AMPA subtype of glutamate receptors. The AMPA receptors mediate MGC calcium activities during retinal waves, whereas the glutamate transporters modulate the occurrence of retinal waves. Thus, MGCs can sense and regulate retinal waves via AMPA receptors and glutamate transporters, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Several pharmacological, dietary, and genetic interventions that increase mammalian lifespan are known, but general principles of lifespan extension remain unclear. Here, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of mice subjected to 8 longevity interventions. We discovered a feminizing effect associated with growth hormone regulation and diminution of sex-related differences. Expanding this analysis to 17 interventions with public data, we observed that many interventions induced similar gene expression changes. We identified hepatic gene signatures associated with lifespan extension across interventions, including upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and drug metabolism, and showed that perturbed pathways may be shared across tissues. We further applied the discovered longevity signatures to identify new lifespan-extending candidates, such as chronic hypoxia, KU-0063794, and ascorbyl-palmitate. Finally, we developed GENtervention, an app that visualizes associations between gene expression changes and longevity. Overall, this study describes general and specific transcriptomic programs of lifespan extension in mice and provides tools to discover new interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Biomineralization of the extracellular matrix is an essential, regulated process. Inappropriate mineralization of bone and the vasculature has devastating effects on patient health, yet an integrated understanding of the chemical and cell biological processes that lead to mineral nucleation remains elusive. Here, we report that biomineralization of bone and the vasculature is associated with extracellular poly(ADP-ribose) synthesized by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases in response to oxidative and/or DNA damage. We use ultrastructural methods to show poly(ADP-ribose) can form both calcified spherical particles, reminiscent of those found in vascular calcification, and biomimetically calcified collagen fibrils similar to bone. Importantly, inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) biosynthesis in vitro and in vivo inhibits biomineralization, suggesting a therapeutic route for the treatment of vascular calcifications. We conclude that poly(ADP-ribose) plays a central chemical role in both pathological and physiological extracellular matrix calcification.

Abstract: Summary
Transplantation of expanded hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and gene therapy based on HSC engineering have emerged as promising approaches for the treatment of hematological diseases. Nevertheless, the immunophenotype of cultured HSCs remains poorly defined. Here, we identify Integrin-α3 (ITGA3) as a marker of cultured human HSCs. Exploiting the pyrimidoindole derivative UM171 to expand cord blood (CB) cells, we show that ITGA3 expression is sufficient to separate the primitive EPCR+CD90+CD133+CD34+CD45RA− HSC population into two functionally distinct fractions presenting mostly short-term (ITGA3−) and both short-term and long-term (ITGA3+) repopulating potential. ITGA3+ cells exhibit robust multilineage differentiation potential, serial reconstitution ability in immunocompromised mice, and an HSC-specific transcriptomic signature. Moreover, ITGA3 expression is functionally required for the long-term engraftment of CB cells. Altogether, our results indicate that ITGA3 is a reliable marker of cultured human long-term repopulating HSCs (LT-HSCs) and represents an important tool to improve the accuracy of prospective HSC identification in culture.

Abstract: Summary
The gut hormone PYY3–36 reduces food intake in humans and exhibits at least additive efficacy in combination with GLP-1. However, the utility of PYY analogs as anti-obesity agents has been severely limited by emesis and rapid proteolysis, a profile similarly observed with native PYY3–36 in obese rhesus macaques. Here, we found that antibody conjugation of a cyclized PYY3–36 analog achieved high NPY2R selectivity, unprecedented in vivo stability, and gradual infusion-like exposure. These properties permitted profound reduction of food intake when administered to macaques for 23 days without a single emetic event in any animal. Co-administration with the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide for an additional 5 days further reduced food intake with only one animal experiencing a single bout of emesis. This antibody-conjugated PYY analog therefore may enable the long-sought potential of GLP-1/PYY-based combination treatment to achieve robust, well-tolerated weight reduction in obese patients.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria and archaea have evolved sophisticated adaptive immune systems that rely on CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided detection and nuclease-mediated elimination of invading nucleic acids. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the type I-F crRNA-guided surveillance complex (Csy complex) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa bound to a double-stranded DNA target. Comparison of this structure to previously determined structures of this complex reveals a ∼180-degree rotation of the C-terminal helical bundle on the “large” Cas8f subunit. We show that the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-induced conformational change in Cas8f exposes a Cas2/3 “nuclease recruitment helix” that is structurally homologous to a virally encoded anti-CRISPR protein (AcrIF3). Structural homology between Cas8f and AcrIF3 suggests that AcrIF3 is a mimic of the Cas8f nuclease recruitment helix.

Abstract: Summary
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of single-stranded RNAs with a contiguous structure that have enhanced stability and a lack of end motifs necessary for interaction with various cellular proteins. Here, we show that unmodified exogenous circRNA is able to bypass cellular RNA sensors and thereby avoid provoking an immune response in RIG-I and Toll-like receptor (TLR) competent cells and in mice. The immunogenicity and protein expression stability of circRNA preparations are found to be dependent on purity, with small amounts of contaminating linear RNA leading to robust cellular immune responses. Unmodified circRNA is less immunogenic than unmodified linear mRNA in vitro, in part due to the evasion of TLR sensing. Finally, we provide the first demonstration to our knowledge of exogenous circRNA delivery and translation in vivo, and we show that circRNA translation is extended in adipose tissue in comparison to unmodified and uridine-modified linear mRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic inflammation predisposes to aging-associated disease, but it is unknown whether immunity regulation might be important for extending healthy lifespan. Here we show that in C. elegans, dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan by modulating a conserved innate immunity pathway that is regulated by p38 signaling and the transcription factor ATF-7. Longevity from DR depends upon p38–ATF-7 immunity being intact but downregulated to a basal level. p38–ATF-7 immunity accelerates aging when hyperactive, influences lifespan independently of pathogen exposure, and is activated by nutrients independently of mTORC1, a major DR mediator. Longevity from reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling (rIIS) also involves p38–ATF-7 downregulation, with signals from DAF-16/FOXO reducing food intake. We conclude that p38–ATF-7 is an immunometabolic pathway that senses bacterial and nutrient signals, that immunity modulation is critical for DR, and that DAF-16/FOXO couples appetite to growth regulation. These conserved mechanisms may influence aging in more complex organisms.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and downstream products of lipid oxidation are emerging as important secondary messengers in tissue homeostasis. However, their regulation and mechanism of action remain poorly studied in vivo during normal development. Here, we reveal that the fine regulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels by its scavenger Catalase to mediate the switch from proliferation to differentiation in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) is crucial. We identify 9-hydroxystearic acid (9-HSA), an endogenous downstream lipid peroxidation product, as a mediator of this effect in the zebrafish retina. We show that the 9-HSA proliferative effect is due to the activation of Notch and Wnt pathways through the inhibition of the histone deacetylase 1. We show that the local and temporal manipulation of H2O2 levels in RPCs is sufficient to trigger their premature differentiation. We finally propose a mechanism that links H2O2 homeostasis and neuronal differentiation via the modulation of lipid peroxidation.

Abstract: Mitochondrial Ca2+ flux is crucial for the regulation of cell metabolism. Ca2+ entry to the mitochondrial matrix is mediated by VDAC1 and MCU with its regulatory molecules. We investigated hepatocytes isolated from conplastic C57BL/6NTac-mtNODLtJ mice (mtNOD) that differ from C57BL/6NTac mice (controls) by a point mutation in mitochondrial-encoded subunit 3 of cytochrome c oxidase, resulting in functional and morphological mitochondrial adaptations. Mice of both strains up to 12 months old were compared using mitochondrial GEM-GECO1 and cytosolic CAR-GECO1 expression to gain knowledge of age-dependent alterations of Ca2+ concentrations. In controls we observed a significant increase in glucose-induced cytosolic Ca2+ concentration with ageing, but only a minor elevation in mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration. Conversely, glucose-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration significantly declined with ageing in mtNOD mice, paralleled by a slight decrease in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. This was consistent with a significant reduction of the MICU1 to MCU expression ratio and a decline in MCUR1. Our results can best be explained in terms of the adaptation of Ca2+ concentrations to the mitochondrial network structure. In the fragmented mitochondrial network of ageing controls there is a need for high cytosolic Ca2+ influx, because only some of the isolated mitochondria are in direct contact with the endoplasmic reticulum. This is not important in the hyper-fused elongated mitochondrial network found in ageing mtNOD mice which facilitates rapid Ca2+ distribution over a large mitochondrial area.

Abstract: Summary
Deciphering how TCR signals are modulated by coinhibitory receptors is of fundamental and clinical interest. Using quantitative interactomics, we define the composition and dynamics of the PD-1 and BTLA coinhibitory signalosomes in primary effector T cells and at the T cell-antigen-presenting cell interface. We also solve the existing controversy regarding the role of the SHP-1 and SHP-2 protein-tyrosine phosphatases in mediating PD-1 coinhibition. PD-1 predominantly recruits SHP-2, but when absent, it recruits SHP-1 and remains functional. In contrast, BTLA predominantly recruits SHP-1 and to a lesser extent SHP-2. By separately analyzing the PD-1-SHP-1 and PD-1-SHP-2 complexes, we show that both dampen the TCR and CD28 signaling pathways equally. Therefore, our study illustrates how comparison of coinhibitory receptor signaling via quantitative interactomics in primary T cells unveils their extent of redundancy and provides a rationale for designing combinations of blocking antibodies in cancer immunotherapy on the basis of undisputed modes of action.

Abstract: Summary
Removal of introns from pre-mRNAs is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression, mediated by spliceosomes that contain snRNAs as key components. Although snRNAs are transcribed in the nucleus and function in the same compartment, all except U6 shuttle to the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, the physiological relevance for shuttling is unclear, in particular because the snRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were reported to remain nuclear. Here, we show that all yeast pre-snRNAs including U6 undergo a stepwise maturation process after nuclear export by Mex67 and Xpo1. Sm- and Lsm-ring attachment occurs in the cytoplasm and is important for the snRNA re-import, mediated by Cse1 and Mtr10. Finally, nuclear pre-snRNA cleavage and trimethylation of the 5′-cap finalizes shuttling. Importantly, preventing pre-snRNAs from being exported or processed results in faulty spliceosome assembly and subsequent genome-wide splicing defects. Thus, pre-snRNA export is obligatory for functional splicing and resembles an essential evolutionarily conserved quality assurance step.

Abstract: Summary
N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) is a peptide-based neurotransmitter that has been extensively studied in many neurological diseases. In this study, we show a specific role of NAAG in cancer. We found that NAAG is more abundant in higher grade cancers and is a source of glutamate in cancers expressing glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), the enzyme that hydrolyzes NAAG to glutamate and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA). Knocking down GCPII expression through genetic alteration or pharmacological inhibition of GCPII results in a reduction of both glutamate concentrations and cancer growth. Moreover, targeting GCPII in combination with glutaminase inhibition accentuates these effects. These findings suggest that NAAG serves as an important reservoir to provide glutamate to cancer cells through GCPII when glutamate production from other sources is limited. Thus, GCPII is a viable target for cancer therapy, either alone or in combination with glutaminase inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
The dynamics and coordination between autophagy machinery and selective receptors during mitophagy are unknown. Also unknown is whether mitophagy depends on pre-existing membranes or is triggered on the surface of damaged mitochondria. Using a ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy inducer, the lactone ivermectin, we have combined genetic and imaging experiments to address these questions. Ubiquitination of mitochondrial fragments is required the earliest, followed by auto-phosphorylation of TBK1. Next, early essential autophagy proteins FIP200 and ATG13 act at different steps, whereas ULK1 and ULK2 are dispensable. Receptors act temporally and mechanistically upstream of ATG13 but downstream of FIP200. The VPS34 complex functions at the omegasome step. ATG13 and optineurin target mitochondria in a discontinuous oscillatory way, suggesting multiple initiation events. Targeted ubiquitinated mitochondria are cradled by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) strands even without functional autophagy machinery and mitophagy adaptors. We propose that damaged mitochondria are ubiquitinated and dynamically encased in ER strands, providing platforms for formation of the mitophagosomes.

Abstract: In this study, we report the development of a nanofiber polycaprolactone scaffold that can act as a stem cell carrier to induce chondrogenesis and promote cartilage repair in vivo. Infrapatellar fat pads were obtained from sheep knee and the stem cells were isolated and characterized by flow cytometry. Defects were created in sheep knee, two defects received adipose tissue derived stem cells (ASCs)-polycaprolactone construct, second group received polycaprolactone (PCL), the third group was chosen as the ASCs group and the fourth group was control group. Morphological evaluation showed that defects treated with ASCs-scaffold constructs were completely filled with cartilage-like tissue, while other groups revealed the formation of a thin layer of cartilage-like tissue in the defects. Real-Time RT-PCR showed the increase in collagen type 2 mRNA levels, aggrecan and Sox9 in ASCs/PCL groups in comparison with the other groups. Immunofluorescence and toluidine blue staining results showed the protein expression of collagen type 2 and formation of round and polygonal clusters of chondrocytes in ASCS/PCL group. According to our results nanofiber polycaprolactone promoted the chondrogenesis of infrapatellar adipose tissue derived stem cells in vivo and could offer significant promise in the biological functionality of stem cell tissue engineering in clinical practice.

Abstract: Summary
Genetically identical cells contain variable numbers of molecules, even if the cells share the same environment. This stochastic variability is prominent when molecules have low abundance, which is the case for mRNA noise. Most studies focused on how transcription affects mRNA noise, and little is known about the role of RNA degradation. To discriminate the fluctuations in these processes during the decay of a pair of reporter mRNAs, we quantified the uncorrelated intrinsic and the correlated extrinsic noise using single-molecule RNA FISH. Intrinsic noise converges to the Poisson level during the decay. mRNAs that have a short half-life are more susceptible to extrinsic noise than stable mRNAs. However, the Xrn1 exonuclease and the NMD pathways, which degrade mRNAs rapidly, were found to have lower fluctuation, which mitigates the noise of the short-lived mRNAs. This permits low variability across the entire range of mRNA half-lives.

Abstract: Summary
We demonstrate that concurrent administration of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and WEE1 inhibitors is effective in inhibiting tumor growth but poorly tolerated. Concurrent treatment with PARP and WEE1 inhibitors induces replication stress, DNA damage, and abrogates the G2 DNA damage checkpoint in both normal and malignant cells. Following cessation of monotherapy with PARP or WEE1 inhibitors, effects of these inhibitors persist suggesting that sequential administration of PARP and WEE1 inhibitors could maintain efficacy while ameliorating toxicity. Strikingly, while sequential administration mirrored concurrent therapy in cancer cells that have high basal replication stress, low basal replication stress in normal cells protected them from DNA damage and toxicity, thus improving tolerability while preserving efficacy in ovarian cancer xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models.

Abstract: Summary
The biological functions and mechanisms of oncogenic KRASG12D (KRAS∗) in resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy are not fully understood. We demonstrate that KRAS∗ represses the expression of interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2), which in turn directly represses CXCL3 expression. KRAS∗-mediated repression of IRF2 results in high expression of CXCL3, which binds to CXCR2 on myeloid-derived suppressor cells and promotes their migration to the tumor microenvironment. Anti-PD-1 resistance of KRAS∗-expressing tumors can be overcome by enforced IRF2 expression or by inhibition of CXCR2. Colorectal cancer (CRC) showing higher IRF2 expression exhibited increased responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy. The KRAS∗-IRF2-CXCL3-CXCR2 axis provides a framework for patient selection and combination therapies to enhance the effectiveness of ICB therapy in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma therapies have remained elusive due to limitations in understanding mechanisms of growth and survival of the tumorigenic population. Using CRISPR-Cas9 approaches in patient-derived GBM stem cells (GSCs) to interrogate function of the coding genome, we identify actionable pathways responsible for growth, which reveal the gene-essential circuitry of GBM stemness and proliferation. In particular, we characterize members of the SOX transcription factor family, SOCS3, USP8, and DOT1L, and protein ufmylation as important for GSC growth. Additionally, we reveal mechanisms of temozolomide resistance that could lead to combination strategies. By reaching beyond static genome analysis of bulk tumors, with a genome-wide functional approach, we reveal genetic dependencies within a broad range of biological processes to provide increased understanding of GBM growth and treatment resistance.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are processed from primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs), many of which are annotated as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We assessed whether MIR205HG, the host gene for miR-205, has independent functions as an lncRNA. Comparing mice with targeted deletions of MIR205HG and miR-205 revealed a functional role for the lncRNA in the anterior pituitary. Mice lacking MIR205HG had a temporal reduction in Pit1, growth hormone, and prolactin. This was mediated, in part, through the ability of this lncRNA to bind and regulate the transcriptional activity of Pit1 in conjunction with Zbtb20. Knockdown of MIR205HG in lactotropes decreased the expression of Pit1, Zbtb20, prolactin, and growth hormone, while its overexpression enhanced the levels of these transcripts. The effects of MIR205HG on the pituitary were independent of miR-205. The data support a role for MIR205HG as an lncRNA that regulates growth hormone and prolactin production in the anterior pituitary.

Abstract: Summary
Aggregation of α-synuclein and formation of inclusions are hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Aggregate formation is affected by cellular environment, but it has been studied almost exclusively in cell-free systems. We quantitatively analyzed α-synuclein inclusion formation and clearance in a yeast cell model of PD expressing either wild-type (WT) α-synuclein or the disease-associated A53T mutant from the galactose (Gal)-inducible promoter. A computer-controlled microfluidics device regulated α-synuclein in cells by means of closed-loop feedback control. We demonstrated that inclusion formation is strictly concentration dependent and that the aggregation threshold of the A53T mutant is about half of the WT α-synuclein (56%). We chemically modulated the proteasomal and autophagic pathways and demonstrated that autophagy is the main determinant of A53T α-synuclein inclusions’ clearance. In addition to proposing a technology to overcome current limitations in dynamically regulating protein expression levels, our results contribute to the biology of PD and have relevance for therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are genetically heterogeneous and highly proliferative neoplasms derived from germinal center (GC) B cells. Here, we show that DLBCLs are dependent on mitochondrial lysine deacetylase SIRT3 for proliferation, survival, self-renewal, and tumor growth in vivo regardless of disease subtype and genetics. SIRT3 knockout attenuated B cell lymphomagenesis in VavP-Bcl2 mice without affecting normal GC formation. Mechanistically, SIRT3 depletion impaired glutamine flux to the TCA cycle via glutamate dehydrogenase and reduction in acetyl-CoA pools, which in turn induce autophagy and cell death. We developed a mitochondrial-targeted class I sirtuin inhibitor, YC8-02, which phenocopied the effects of SIRT3 depletion and killed DLBCL cells. SIRT3 is thus a metabolic non-oncogene addiction and therapeutic target for DLBCLs.

Abstract: Summary
The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in human cancers. An analysis of five data platforms in 10,225 patient samples from 32 cancers reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) enables comprehensive assessment of p53 pathway involvement in these cancers. More than 91% of TP53-mutant cancers exhibit second allele loss by mutation, chromosomal deletion, or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. TP53 mutations are associated with enhanced chromosomal instability, including increased amplification of oncogenes and deep deletion of tumor suppressor genes. Tumors with TP53 mutations differ from their non-mutated counterparts in RNA, miRNA, and protein expression patterns, with mutant TP53 tumors displaying enhanced expression of cell cycle progression genes and proteins. A mutant TP53 RNA expression signature shows significant correlation with reduced survival in 11 cancer types. Thus, TP53 mutation has profound effects on tumor cell genomic structure, expression, and clinical outlook.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells is a highly complex and tightly regulated process. Its dysregulation is one characteristic of type 2 diabetes, and thus, an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms controlling insulin secretion is essential for rational therapeutic intervention. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been established as major regulators of insulin exocytosis. Recent studies also suggest the involvement of adhesion GPCRs, a non-prototypical class of GPCRs. Here, we identify latrophilins, which belong to the class of adhesion GPCRs, to be highly expressed in different cell types of pancreatic islets. In vitro and ex vivo analyses show that distinct splice variants of the latrophilin LPHN3/ADGRL3 decrease insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells by reducing intracellular cyclic AMP levels via the Gi-mediated pathway. Our data highlight the key role of LPHN3 in modulating insulin secretion and its potential as therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression profiles of more than 10,000 individual microglial cells isolated from cortex and hippocampus of male and female AppNL-G-F mice over time demonstrate that progressive amyloid-β accumulation accelerates two main activated microglia states that are also present during normal aging. Activated response microglia (ARMs) are composed of specialized subgroups overexpressing MHC type II and putative tissue repair genes (Dkk2, Gpnmb, and Spp1) and are strongly enriched with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk genes. Microglia from female mice progress faster in this activation trajectory. Similar activated states are also found in a second AD model and in human brain. Apoe, the major genetic risk factor for AD, regulates the ARMs but not the interferon response microglia (IRMs). Thus, the ARMs response is the converging point for aging, sex, and genetic AD risk factors.

Abstract: Summary
Unspliced XBP1 mRNA encodes XBP1u, the transcriptionally inert variant of the unfolded protein response (UPR) transcription factor XBP1s. XBP1u targets its mRNA-ribosome-nascent-chain-complex to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to facilitate UPR activation and prevents overactivation. Yet, its membrane association is controversial. Here, we use cell-free translocation and cellular assays to define a moderately hydrophobic stretch in XBP1u that is sufficient to mediate insertion into the ER membrane. Mutagenesis of this transmembrane (TM) region reveals residues that facilitate XBP1u turnover by an ER-associated degradation route that is dependent on signal peptide peptidase (SPP). Furthermore, the impact of these mutations on TM helix dynamics was assessed by residue-specific amide exchange kinetics, evaluated by a semi-automated algorithm. Based on our results, we suggest that SPP-catalyzed intramembrane proteolysis of TM helices is not only determined by their conformational flexibility, but also by side-chain interactions near the scissile peptide bond with the enzyme’s active site.

Abstract: Summary
Transporting epithelial cells generate arrays of microvilli, known as a brush border, to enhance functional capacity. To understand brush border formation, we used live cell imaging to visualize apical remodeling early in this process. Strikingly, we found that individual microvilli exhibit persistent active motility, translocating across the cell surface at ∼0.2 μm/min. Perturbation with inhibitors and photokinetic experiments revealed that microvillar motility is driven by actin assembly at the barbed ends of core bundles, which in turn is linked to robust treadmilling of these structures. Actin regulatory factors IRTKS and EPS8 localize to the barbed ends of motile microvilli, where they control the kinetics and nature of movement. As the apical surface of differentiating epithelial cells is crowded with nascent microvilli, persistent motility promotes collisions between protrusions and ultimately clustering and consolidation into higher-order arrays. Thus, microvillar motility represents a previously unrecognized driving force for apical surface remodeling and maturation during epithelial differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Viral infection triggers host defenses through pattern-recognition receptor-mediated cytokine production, inflammasome activation, and apoptosis of the infected cells. Inflammasome-activated caspases are known to cleave cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Here, we found that apoptotic caspases are critically involved in regulating both DNA and RNA virus-triggered host defenses, in which activated caspase-3 cleaved cGAS, MAVS, and IRF3 to prevent cytokine overproduction. Caspase-3 was exclusively required in human cells, whereas caspase-7 was involved only in murine cells to inactivate cGAS, reflecting distinct regulatory mechanisms in different species. Caspase-mediated cGAS cleavage was enhanced in the presence of dsDNA. Alternative MAVS cleavage sites were used to ensure the inactivation of this critical protein. Elevated type I IFNs were detected in caspase-3-deficient cells without any infection. Casp3−/− mice consistently showed increased resistance to viral infection and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our results demonstrate that apoptotic caspases control innate immunity and maintain immune homeostasis against viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin loops enable transcription-factor-bound distal enhancers to interact with their target promoters to regulate transcriptional programs. Although developmental transcription factors such as active forms of Notch can directly stimulate transcription by activating enhancers, the effect of their oncogenic subversion on the 3D organization of cancer genomes is largely undetermined. By mapping chromatin looping genome-wide in Notch-dependent triple-negative breast cancer and B cell lymphoma, we show that beyond the well-characterized role of Notch as an activator of distal enhancers, Notch regulates its direct target genes by instructing enhancer repositioning. Moreover, a large fraction of Notch-instructed regulatory loops form highly interacting enhancer and promoter spatial clusters termed “3D cliques.” Loss- and gain-of-function experiments show that Notch preferentially targets hyperconnected 3D cliques that regulate the expression of crucial proto-oncogenes. Our observations suggest that oncogenic hijacking of developmental transcription factors can dysregulate transcription through widespread effects on the spatial organization of cancer genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient chemotaxis requires rapid coordination between different parts of the cell in response to changing directional cues. Here, we investigate the mechanism of front-rear coordination in chemotactic neutrophils. We find that changes in the protrusion rate at the cell front are instantaneously coupled to changes in retraction at the cell rear, while myosin II accumulation at the rear exhibits a reproducible 9–15-s lag. In turning cells, myosin II exhibits dynamic side-to-side relocalization at the cell rear in response to turning of the leading edge and facilitates efficient turning by rapidly re-orienting the rear. These manifestations of front-rear coupling can be explained by a simple quantitative model incorporating reversible actin-myosin interactions with a rearward-flowing actin network. Finally, the system can be tuned by the degree of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) phosphorylation, which appears to be set in an optimal range to balance persistence of movement and turning ability.

Abstract: Summary
The genetic makeup of cancer cells directs oncogenesis and influences the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we massively profiled genes that functionally drive tumorigenesis using genome-scale in vivo CRISPR screens in hosts with different levels of immunocompetence. As a convergent hit from these screens, Prkar1a mutant cells are able to robustly outgrow as tumors in fully immunocompetent hosts. Functional interrogation showed that Prkar1a loss greatly altered the transcriptome and proteome involved in inflammatory and immune responses as well as extracellular protein production. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling and flow cytometry analysis mapped the tumor microenvironment of Prkar1a mutant tumors and revealed the transcriptomic alterations in host myeloid cells. Taken together, our data suggest that tumor-intrinsic mutations in Prkar1a lead to drastic alterations in the genetic program of cancer cells, thereby remodeling the tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
PARN loss-of-function mutations cause a severe form of the hereditary disease dyskeratosis congenita (DC). PARN deficiency affects the stability of non-coding RNAs such as human telomerase RNA (hTR), but these effects do not explain the severe disease in patients. We demonstrate that PARN deficiency affects the levels of numerous miRNAs in human cells. PARN regulates miRNA levels by stabilizing either mature or precursor miRNAs by removing oligo(A) tails added by the poly(A) polymerase PAPD5, which if remaining recruit the exonuclease DIS3L or DIS3L2 to degrade the miRNA. PARN knockdown destabilizes multiple miRNAs that repress p53 translation, which leads to an increase in p53 accumulation in a Dicer-dependent manner, thus explaining why PARN-defective patients show p53 accumulation. This work also reveals that DIS3L and DIS3L2 are critical 3′ to 5′ exonucleases that regulate miRNA stability, with the addition and removal of 3′ end extensions controlling miRNA levels in the cell.

Abstract: Summary
The tripeptide glutathione suppresses the iron-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death process of ferroptosis. How glutathione abundance is regulated in the cell and how this regulation alters ferroptosis sensitivity is poorly understood. Using genome-wide human haploid genetic screening technology coupled to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we directly identify genes that regulate intracellular glutathione abundance and characterize their role in ferroptosis regulation. Disruption of the ATP binding cassette (ABC)-family transporter multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) prevents glutathione efflux from the cell and strongly inhibits ferroptosis. High levels of MRP1 expression decrease sensitivity to certain pro-apoptotic chemotherapeutic drugs, while collaterally sensitizing to all tested pro-ferroptotic agents. By contrast, disruption of KEAP1 and NAA38, leading to the stabilization of the transcription factor NRF2, increases glutathione levels but only weakly protects from ferroptosis. This is due in part to concomitant NRF2-mediated upregulation of MRP1. These results pinpoint glutathione efflux as an unanticipated regulator of ferroptosis sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Touch and mechanical pain represent distinct, but interactive, modalities of mechanosensation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these mechanotransduction processes remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that deletion of the mechanically activated and rapidly adapting Piezo2 channel in a portion of the low-threshold mechanoreceptors and a majority of the IB4-positive nociceptors impairs touch but sensitizes mechanical pain in mice. Ectopic expression of the Piezo2 homolog, the intermediately adapting Piezo1 channel, in sensory neurons can sensitize touch in normal mice and rescue defective touch of the Piezo2-knockout mice. Broad expression of Piezo1 in sensory neurons decreases, rather than evokes, mechanical pain responses. Together, our data suggest that Piezo channels can mediate touch and indirectly suppress acute pain. Tuning Piezo-mediated touch sensitivity allows us to recapitulate the inhibitory effect of touch on acute pain in mouse models.

Abstract: Summary
Stress-inducible molecular chaperones have essential roles in maintaining protein homeostasis, but the extent to which they affect overall proteome stability remains unclear. Here, we analyze the effects of the DnaK (Hsp70) system on protein stability in Escherichia coli using pulse proteolysis combined with quantitative proteomics. We quantify ∼1,500 soluble proteins and find ∼500 of these to be protease sensitive under normal growth conditions, indicating a high prevalence of conformationally dynamic proteins, forming a metastable subproteome. Acute heat stress results in the unfolding of an additional ∼200 proteins, reflected in the exposure of otherwise buried hydrophobic regions. Overexpression of the DnaK chaperone system markedly stabilizes numerous thermo-sensitive proteins, including multiple ribosomal proteins and large, hetero-oligomeric proteins containing the evolutionarily ancient c.37 fold (P loop nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases). Thus, the Hsp70 system, in addition to its known chaperone functions, has a remarkable capacity to stabilize proteins in their folded states under denaturing stress conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6 form complexes with D-type cyclins to drive cell proliferation. A well-known target of cyclin D-Cdk4,6 is the retinoblastoma protein Rb, which inhibits cell-cycle progression until its inactivation by phosphorylation. However, the role of Rb phosphorylation by cyclin D-Cdk4,6 in cell-cycle progression is unclear because Rb can be phosphorylated by other cyclin-Cdks, and cyclin D-Cdk4,6 has other targets involved in cell division. Here, we show that cyclin D-Cdk4,6 docks one side of an alpha-helix in the Rb C terminus, which is not recognized by cyclins E, A, and B. This helix-based docking mechanism is shared by the p107 and p130 Rb-family members across metazoans. Mutation of the Rb C-terminal helix prevents its phosphorylation, promotes G1 arrest, and enhances Rb’s tumor suppressive function. Our work conclusively demonstrates that the cyclin D-Rb interaction drives cell division and expands the diversity of known cyclin-based protein docking mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) exerts a powerful orexigenic effect in the hypothalamus. However, extra-hypothalamic nuclei also produce NPY, but its influence on energy homeostasis is unclear. Here we uncover a previously unknown feeding stimulatory pathway that is activated under conditions of stress in combination with calorie-dense food; NPY neurons in the central amygdala are responsible for an exacerbated response to a combined stress and high-fat-diet intervention. Central amygdala NPY neuron-specific Npy overexpression mimics the obese phenotype seen in a combined stress and high-fat-diet model, which is prevented by the selective ablation of Npy. Using food intake and energy expenditure as readouts, we demonstrate that selective activation of central amygdala NPY neurons results in increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure. Mechanistically, it is the diminished insulin signaling capacity on central amygdala NPY neurons under combined stress and high-fat-diet conditions that leads to the exaggerated development of obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Establishment of robust gene expression boundary is crucial for creating elaborate morphology during development. However, mechanisms underlying boundary formation have been extensively studied only in a few model systems. We examined the establishment of zic1/zic4-expression boundary demarcating dorsoventral boundary of the entire trunk of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) and identified a subgroup of dermomyotomal cells called horizontal boundary cells (HBCs) as crucial players for the boundary formation. Embryological and genetic analyses demonstrated that HBCs play crucial roles in the two major events of the process, i.e., refinement and maintenance. In the refinement, HBCs could serve as a chemical barrier against Wnts from the neural tube by expressing Hhip. At later stages, HBCs participate in the maintenance of the boundary by differentiating into the horizontal myoseptum physically inhibiting cell mixing across the boundary. These findings reveal the mechanisms underlying the dorsoventral boundary in the teleost trunk by specialized boundary cells.

Abstract: Summary
Plants exhibit different flowering behaviors in response to variable photoperiods across a wide geographical range. Here, we identify MYC3, a bHLH transcription factor, and its cis-element form the long-sought regulatory module responsible for cis-regulatory changes at the florigen gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) that mediate natural variation in photoperiodic flowering responses in Arabidopsis. MYC3 is stabilized by DELLAs in the gibberellin pathway to suppress FT through binding the ACGGAT motif and antagonizing CONSTANS (CO) activation. Changing photoperiods modulate the relative abundance of MYC3 and CO, thus determining either of them as the predominant regulator for FT expression under different day lengths. Cis-regulatory changes in the MYC3 binding site at FT are associated with natural variation in day-length requirement for flowering in Arabidopsis accessions. Our findings reveal that environmental and developmental signals converge at MYC3 suppression of FT, an elementary event underlying natural variation in photoperiodic flowering responses.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is rich in mitochondria and plays important roles in energy expenditure, thermogenesis, and glucose homeostasis. We find that levels of mitochondrial protein succinylation and malonylation are high in BAT and subject to physiological and genetic regulation. BAT-specific deletion of Sirt5, a mitochondrial desuccinylase and demalonylase, results in dramatic increases in global protein succinylation and malonylation. Mass spectrometry-based quantification of succinylation reveals that Sirt5 regulates the key thermogenic protein in BAT, UCP1. Mutation of the two succinylated lysines in UCP1 to acyl-mimetic glutamine and glutamic acid significantly decreases its stability and activity. The reduced function of UCP1 and other proteins in Sirt5KO BAT results in impaired mitochondria respiration, defective mitophagy, and metabolic inflexibility. Thus, succinylation of UCP1 and other mitochondrial proteins plays an important role in BAT and in regulation of energy homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
During an infection, immune cells must identify the specific level of threat posed by a given bacterial input in order to generate an appropriate response. Given that they use a general non-self-recognition system, known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), to detect bacteria, it remains unclear how they transmit information about a particular threat. To determine whether host cells can use signaling dynamics to transmit contextual information about a bacterial stimulus, we use live-cell imaging to make simultaneous quantitative measurements of host MAPK and NF-κB signaling, two key pathways downstream of TLRs, and bacterial infection and load. This combined, single-cell approach reveals that NF-κB and MAPK signaling dynamics are sufficient to discriminate between (1) pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) versus bacteria, (2) extracellular versus intracellular bacteria, (3) pathogenic versus non-pathogenic bacteria, and (4) the presence or absence of features indicating an active intracellular bacterial infection, such as replication and effector secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) acting at membrane contact sites (MCS) between the ER and other organelles contain domains involved in heterotypic (e.g., ER to Golgi) membrane tethering as well as domains involved in lipid transfer. Here, we show that a long ≈90 aa intrinsically unfolded sequence at the N terminus of oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) controls OSBP orientation and dynamics at MCS. This Gly-Pro-Ala-rich sequence, whose hydrodynamic radius is twice as that of folded domains, prevents the two PH domains of the OSBP dimer from homotypically tethering two Golgi-like membranes and considerably facilitates OSBP in-plane diffusion and recycling at MCS. Although quite distant in sequence, the N terminus of OSBP-related protein-4 (ORP4) has similar effects. We propose that N-terminal sequences of low complexity in ORPs form an entropic barrier that restrains protein orientation, limits protein density, and facilitates protein mobility in the narrow and crowded MCS environment.

Abstract: Summary
Itch is an unpleasant skin sensation that can be triggered by exposure to many chemicals, including those released by mast cells. The natriuretic polypeptide b (Nppb)-expressing class of sensory neurons, when activated, elicits scratching responses in mice, but it is unclear which itch-inducing agents stimulate these cells and the receptors involved. Here, we identify receptors expressed by Nppb neurons and demonstrate the functional importance of these receptors as sensors of endogenous pruritogens released by mast cells. Our search for receptors in Nppb neurons reveals that they express leukotriene, serotonin, and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. Targeted cell ablation, calcium imaging of primary sensory neurons, and conditional receptor knockout studies demonstrate that these receptors induce itch by the direct stimulation of Nppb neurons and neurotransmission through the canonical gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)-dependent spinal cord itch pathway. Together, our results define a molecular and cellular pathway for mast cell-induced itch.

Abstract: Summary
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptors are widely distributed throughout the nervous system, enabling physiological and pharmacological control of glucose and energy homeostasis. Here we elucidated the importance of Glp1r expression within cellular domains targeted by expression of Wnt1-Cre2 or Phox2b-Cre. Widespread loss of neural Glp1r in Glp1rΔWnt1−/− mice had no effect on basal food intake, gastric emptying, and glucose homeostasis. However, the glucoregulatory actions of GLP-1R agonists, but not gut-selective DPP-4 inhibition, were preserved in Glp1rΔWnt1−/− mice. Unexpectedly, selective reduction of Glp1r expression within neurons targeted by Phox2b-Cre impaired glucose homeostasis and gastric emptying and attenuated the extent of weight loss achieved with sustained GLP-1R agonism. Collectively, these studies identify discrete neural domains of Glp1r expression mediating GLP-1-regulated control of metabolism and the gut-brain axis and reveal the unexpected importance of neuronal Phox2b+ cells expressing GLP-1R for physiological regulation of gastric emptying, islet hormone responses, and glucose homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Dopamine (DA) transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) facilitates cue-reward associations and appetitive action. Reward-related accumbal DA release dynamics are traditionally ascribed to ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons. Activation of VTA to NAc DA signaling is thought to reinforce action and transfer reward-related information to predictive cues, allowing cues to guide behavior and elicit dopaminergic activity. Here, we use optogenetics to control DA neuron activity and voltammetry to simultaneously record accumbal DA release in order to quantify how reinforcer-evoked dopaminergic activity shapes conditioned mesolimbic DA transmission. We find that cues predicting access to DA neuron self-stimulation elicit conditioned responding and NAc DA release. However, cue-evoked DA release does not reflect the cost or magnitude of DA neuron activation. Accordingly, conditioned accumbal DA release selectively tracks the expected availability of DA-neuron-mediated reinforcement. This work provides insight into how mesolimbic DA transmission drives and encodes appetitive action.

Abstract: Summary
TFEB and TFE3 are transcriptional regulators of the innate immune response, but the mechanisms regulating their activation upon pathogen infection are poorly elucidated. Using C. elegans and mammalian models, we report that the master metabolic modulator 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its negative regulator Folliculin (FLCN) act upstream of TFEB/TFE3 in the innate immune response, independently of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. In nematodes, loss of FLCN or overexpression of AMPK confers pathogen resistance via activation of TFEB/TFE3-dependent antimicrobial genes, whereas ablation of total AMPK activity abolishes this phenotype. Similarly, in mammalian cells, loss of FLCN or pharmacological activation of AMPK induces TFEB/TFE3-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Importantly, a rapid reduction in cellular ATP levels in murine macrophages is observed upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment accompanied by an acute AMPK activation and TFEB nuclear localization. These results uncover an ancient, highly conserved, and pharmacologically actionable mechanism coupling energy status with innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Pavement cells form wavy interlocking patterns in the leaf epidermis of many plants. We use computational mechanics to simulate the morphogenetic process based on microtubule organization and cell wall chemistry. Based on the in silico simulations and experimental evidence, we suggest that a multistep process underlies the morphogenesis of pavement cells. The in silico model predicts alternatingly located, feedback-augmented mechanical heterogeneity of the periclinal and anticlinal walls. It suggests that the emergence of waves is created by a stiffening of the emerging indented sides, an effect that matches cellulose and de-esterified pectin patterns in the cell wall. Further, conceptual evidence for mechanical buckling of the cell walls is provided, a mechanism that has the potential to initiate wavy patterns de novo and may precede chemical and geometrical symmetry breaking.

Abstract: Summary
The immune system generates pathogen-tailored responses. The precise innate immune cell types and pathways that direct robust adaptive immune responses have not been fully characterized. By using fluorescent pathogens combined with massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq, we comprehensively characterized the initial 48 h of the innate immune response to diverse pathogens. We found that across all pathogens tested, most of the lymph node cell types and states showed little pathogen specificity. In contrast, the rare antigen-positive cells displayed pathogen-specific transcriptional programs as early as 24 h after immunization. In addition, mycobacteria activated a specific NK-driven IFNγ response. Depletion of NK cells and IFNγ showed that IFNγ initiated a monocyte-specific signaling cascade, leading to the production of major chemokines and cytokines that promote Th1 development. Our systems immunology approach sheds light on early events in innate immune responses and may help further development of safe and efficient vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Deregulated signal transduction is a cancer hallmark, and its complexity and interconnectivity imply that combination therapy should be considered, but large data volumes that cover the complexity are required in user-friendly ways. Here, we present a searchable database resource of synthetic lethality with a PI3 kinase signal transduction inhibitor by performing a saturation screen with an ultra-complex shRNA library containing 30 independent shRNAs per gene target. We focus on Ras-PI3 kinase signaling with T cell leukemia as a screening platform for multiple clinical and experimental reasons. Our resource predicts multiple combination-based therapies with high fidelity, ten of which we confirmed with small molecule inhibitors. Included are biochemical assays, as well as the IPI145 (duvelisib) inhibitor. We uncover the mechanism of synergy between the PI3 kinase inhibitor GDC0941 (pictilisib) and the tubulin inhibitor vincristine and demonstrate broad synergy in 28 cell lines of 5 cancer types and efficacy in preclinical leukemia mouse trials.

Abstract: Summary
Structural heterogeneity is a hallmark of living cells that drives local mechanical properties and dynamic cellular responses. However, the robust quantification of intracellular mechanics is lacking from conventional methods. Here, we describe the development of deformation microscopy, which leverages conventional imaging and an automated hyperelastic warping algorithm to investigate strain history, deformation dynamics, and changes in structural heterogeneity within the interior of cells and cell nuclei. Using deformation microscopy, we found that partial or complete disruption of LINC complexes in cardiomyocytes in vitro and lamin A/C deficiency in myocytes in vivo abrogate dominant tensile loading in the nuclear interior. We also found that cells cultured on stiff substrates or in hyperosmotic conditions displayed abnormal strain burden and asymmetries at interchromatin regions, which are associated with active transcription. Deformation microscopy represents a foundational approach toward intracellular elastography, with the potential utility to provide mechanistic and quantitative insights in diverse mechanobiological applications.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac outflow tract (OFT) is a major hotspot for congenital heart diseases. A thorough understanding of the cellular diversity, transitions, and regulatory networks of normal OFT development is essential to decipher the etiology of OFT malformations. We performed single-cell transcriptomic sequencing of 55,611 mouse OFT cells from three developmental stages that generally correspond to the early, middle, and late stages of OFT remodeling and septation. Known cellular transitions, such as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, have been recapitulated. In particular, we identified convergent development of the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) lineage where intermediate cell subpopulations were found to be involved in either myocardial-to-VSMC trans-differentiation or mesenchymal-to-VSMC transition. Finally, we uncovered transcriptional regulators potentially governing cellular transitions. Our study provides a single-cell reference map of cell states for normal OFT development and paves the way for further studies of the etiology of OFT malformations at the single-cell level.

Abstract: Summary
Genome integrity in primordial germ cells (PGCs) is a prerequisite for fertility and species maintenance. In C. elegans, PGCs require global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) to remove UV-induced DNA lesions. Failure to remove the lesions leads to the activation of the C. elegans p53, CEP-1, resulting in mitotic arrest of the PGCs. We show that the eIF4E2 translation initiation factor IFE-4 in somatic gonad precursor (SGP) niche cells regulates the CEP-1/p53-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) in PGCs. We determine that the IFE-4 translation target EGL-15/FGFR regulates the non-cell-autonomous DDR that is mediated via FGF-like signaling. Using hair follicle stem cells as a paradigm, we demonstrate that the eIF4E2-mediated niche cell regulation of the p53 response in stem cells is highly conserved in mammals. We thus reveal that the somatic niche regulates the CEP-1/p53-mediated DNA damage checkpoint in PGCs. Our data suggest that the somatic niche impacts the stability of heritable genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Tactile working memory engages a broad network of cortical regions in primates. To assess whether the conclusions drawn from primates apply to rodents, we examined the vibrissal primary somatosensory cortex (vS1) and the prelimbic cortex (PL) in a delayed comparison task. Rats compared the speeds of two vibrissal vibrations, stimulus1 and stimulus2, separated by a delay of 2 s. Neuronal firing rates in vS1 and PL encode both stimuli in real time. Across the delay, the stimulus1 representation declines more precipitously in vS1 than in PL. Theta-band local field potential (LFP) coherence between vS1 and PL peaks at trial onset and remains elevated during the interstimulus interval; simultaneously, vS1 spikes become phase locked to PL LFP. Phase locking is stronger on correct (versus error) trials. Tactile working memory in rats appears to be mediated by a posterior (vS1) to anterior (PL) flow of information, with performance facilitated through coherent LFP oscillation.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomal frameshifting during the translation of RNA is implicated in human disease and viral infection. While previous work has uncovered many details about single RNA frameshifting kinetics in vitro, little is known about how single RNA frameshift in living systems. To confront this problem, we have developed technology to quantify live-cell single RNA translation dynamics in frameshifted open reading frames. Applying this technology to RNA encoding the HIV-1 frameshift sequence reveals a small subset (∼8%) of the translating pool robustly frameshift. Frameshifting RNA are translated at similar rates as non-frameshifting RNA (∼3 aa/s) and can continuously frameshift for more than four rounds of translation. Fits to a bursty model of frameshifting constrain frameshifting kinetic rates and demonstrate how ribosomal traffic jams contribute to the persistence of the frameshifting state. These data provide insight into retroviral frameshifting and could lead to alternative strategies to perturb the process in living cells.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence demonstrates that interleukin-10 (IL-10), known as an immunosuppressive cytokine, induces antitumor effects depending on CD8+ T cells. However, it remains elusive how immunosuppressive effects of IL-10 contribute to CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. We generated Cetuximab-based IL-10 fusion protein (CmAb-(IL10)2) to prolong its half-life and allow tumor-targeted delivery of IL-10. Our results demonstrated potent antitumor effects of CmAb-(IL10)2 with reduced toxicity. Moreover, we revealed a mechanism of CmAb-(IL10)2 preventing dendritic cell (DC)-mediated CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte apoptosis through regulating IFN-γ production. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade, CmAb-(IL10)2 significantly improves antitumor effects in mice with advanced tumors. Our findings reveal a DC-regulating role of IL-10 to potentiate CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity and provide a potential strategy to improve cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
During the initial stages of tumorigenesis, the tissue microenvironment where the pro-tumor cells reside plays a crucial role in determining the fate of these cells. Transition zones, where two types of epithelial cells meet, are high-risk sites for carcinogenesis, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. Here, we show that persistent upregulation of Notch signaling induces neoplastic tumorigenesis in a transition zone between the salivary gland imaginal ring cells and the giant cells in Drosophila larvae. In this region, local endogenous JAK-STAT and JNK signaling creates a tissue microenvironment that is susceptible to oncogenic-Notch-induced tumorigenesis, whereas the rest of the salivary gland imaginal ring is refractory to Notch-induced tumor transformation. JNK signaling activates a matrix metalloprotease (MMP1) to promote Notch-induced tumorigenesis at the transition zone. These findings illustrate the significance of local endogenous inflammatory signaling in primary tumor formation.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptive drug-resistance mechanisms allow human tumors to evade treatment through selection and expansion of treatment-resistant clones. Here, studying clonal evolution of tumor cells derived from human pancreatic tumors, we demonstrate that in vitro cultures and in vivo tumors are maintained by a common set of tumorigenic cells that can be used to establish clonal replica tumors (CRTs), large cohorts of animals bearing human tumors with identical clonal composition. Using CRTs to conduct quantitative assessments of adaptive responses to therapeutics, we uncovered a multitude of functionally heterogeneous subpopulations of cells with differential degrees of drug sensitivity. High-throughput isolation and deep characterization of unique clonal lineages showed genetic and transcriptomic diversity underlying functionally diverse subpopulations. Molecular annotation of gemcitabine-naive clonal lineages with distinct responses to treatment in the context of CRTs generated signatures that can predict the response to chemotherapy, representing a potential biomarker to stratify patients with pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The Foxp3 transcription factor is a crucial determinant of both regulatory T (TREG) cell development and their functional maintenance. Appropriate modulation of tolerogenic immune responses therefore requires the tight regulation of Foxp3 transcriptional output, and this involves both transcriptional and post-translational regulation. Here, we show that during T cell activation, phosphorylation of Foxp3 in TREG cells can be regulated by a TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-Nemo-like kinase (NLK) signaling pathway. NLK interacts and phosphorylates Foxp3 in TREG cells, resulting in the stabilization of protein levels by preventing association with the STUB1 E3-ubiquitin protein ligase. Conditional TREG cell NLK-knockout (NLKΔTREG) results in decreased TREG cell-mediated immunosuppression in vivo, and NLK-deficient TREG cell animals develop more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our data suggest a molecular mechanism, in which stimulation of TCR-mediated signaling can induce a TAK1-NLK pathway to sustain Foxp3 transcriptional activity through the stabilization of protein levels, thereby maintaining TREG cell suppressive function.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cell (Treg) activation is crucial for maintaining self-tolerance, but the translational regulation of this process is still poorly understood. Although ribosome biogenesis is considered a housekeeping process, emerging evidence supports the hypothesis that ribosome biogenesis can selectively regulate protein synthesis by tuning translation. Here, we focused on the ribosome biogenesis factor Noc4L, based on the observations that Noc4L is highly expressed in activated Tregs. Conditional Noc4L knockout in Tregs resulted in a lethal autoimmune phenotype resembling Treg-deficient scurfy mice. Interestingly, the Noc4L defect did not globally affect overall protein translation in Tregs but was selectively detrimental to the expression of mRNAs related to Treg activation. These results demonstrate the critical role of Noc4L-mediated ribosome biogenesis in controlling the activation of Tregs and maintaining immune tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Exomeres are a recently discovered type of extracellular nanoparticle with no known biological function. Herein, we describe a simple ultracentrifugation-based method for separation of exomeres from exosomes. Exomeres are enriched in Argonaute 1–3 and amyloid precursor protein. We identify distinct functions of exomeres mediated by two of their cargo, the β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6Gal-I) that α2,6- sialylates N-glycans, and the EGFR ligand, amphiregulin (AREG). Functional ST6Gal-I in exomeres can be transferred to cells, resulting in hypersialylation of recipient cell-surface proteins including β1-integrin. AREG-containing exomeres elicit prolonged EGFR and downstream signaling in recipient cells, modulate EGFR trafficking in normal intestinal organoids, and dramatically enhance the growth of colonic tumor organoids. This study provides a simplified method of exomere isolation and demonstrates that exomeres contain and can transfer functional cargo. These findings underscore the heterogeneity of nanoparticles and should accelerate advances in determining the composition and biological functions of exomeres.

We find that PDGFR-β signaling decreases in myocardium with age and that conditional activation PDGFR-β in cardiomyocytes promotes heart regeneration. Employing RNA sequencing, we show that the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2) can be upregulated by PDGFR-β signaling in primary cardiomyocytes. Conditional knockout of Ezh2 blocks cardiomyocyte proliferation and H3K27me3 modification during neonatal heart regeneration with Ink4a/Arf upregulation, even in mice with myocyte-specific conditional activation of PDGFR-β. We also show that PDGFR-β controls EZH2 expression via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/p-Akt pathway in cardiomyocytes. Gene therapy with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) encoding activated PDGFR-β enhances adult heart regeneration and systolic function. Our data demonstrate that the PDGFR-β/EZH2 pathway is critical for promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration, providing a potential target for cardiac repair.

Abstract: Summary
To optimize fitness, pathogens selectively activate their virulence program upon host entry. Here, we report that the facultative intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes exploits exogenous oligopeptides, a ubiquitous organic N source, to sense the environment and control the activity of its virulence transcriptional activator, PrfA. Using a genetic screen in adsorbent-treated (PrfA-inducing) medium, we found that PrfA is functionally regulated by the balance between activating and inhibitory nutritional peptides scavenged via the Opp transport system. Activating peptides provide essential cysteine precursor for the PrfA-inducing cofactor glutathione (GSH). Non-cysteine-containing peptides cause promiscuous PrfA inhibition. Biophysical and co-crystallization studies reveal that peptides inhibit PrfA through steric blockade of the GSH binding site, a regulation mechanism directly linking bacterial virulence and metabolism. L. monocytogenes mutant analysis in macrophages and our functional data support a model in which changes in the balance of antagonistic Opp-imported oligopeptides promote PrfA induction intracellularly and PrfA repression outside the host.

Abstract: Summary
Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a key regulator of type I interferon and pro-inflammatory responses during infection, cellular stress, and cancer. Here, we reveal a mechanism for how STING balances activation of IRF3- and NF-κB-dependent transcription and discover that acquisition of discrete signaling modules in the vertebrate STING C-terminal tail (CTT) shapes downstream immunity. As a defining example, we identify a motif appended to the CTT of zebrafish STING that inverts the typical vertebrate signaling response and results in dramatic NF-κB activation and weak IRF3-interferon signaling. We determine a co-crystal structure that explains how this CTT sequence recruits TRAF6 as a new binding partner and demonstrate that the minimal motif is sufficient to reprogram human STING and immune activation in macrophage cells. Together, our results define the STING CTT as a linear signaling hub that can acquire modular motifs to readily adapt downstream immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical cues influence pluripotent stem cell differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) exhibit unusual cytomechanical properties, including low cell stiffness and attenuated responses to substrate rigidity, but the underlying structural basis remains obscure. Using super-resolution microscopy to investigate the actin cytoskeleton in mESCs, we observed that the actin cortex consists of a distinctively sparse and isotropic network. Surprisingly, the architecture and mechanics of the mESC actin cortex appear to be largely myosin II-independent. The network density can be modulated by perturbing Arp2/3 and formin, whereas capping protein (CP) negatively regulates cell stiffness. Transient Arp2/3-containing aster-like structures are implicated in the organization and mechanical homeostasis of the cortical network. By generating a low-density network that physically excludes myosin II, the interplay between Arp2/3, formin, and CP governs the nanoscale architecture of the actin cortex and prescribes the cytomechanical properties of mESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Promoter CpG islands are typically unmethylated in normal cells, but in cancer a proportion are subject to hypermethylation. Using methylome sequencing we identified CpG islands that display partial methylation encroachment across the 5′ or 3′ CpG island borders. CpG island methylation encroachment is widespread in prostate and breast cancer and commonly associates with gene suppression. We show that the pattern of H3K4me1 at CpG island borders in normal cells predicts the different modes of cancer CpG island hypermethylation. Notably, genetic manipulation of Kmt2d results in concordant alterations in H3K4me1 levels and CpG island border DNA methylation encroachment. Our findings suggest a role for H3K4me1 in the demarcation of CpG island methylation borders in normal cells, which become eroded in cancer.

Abstract: The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signaling pathway is a promising target for gastric cancer (GC) treatment; however the efficacy of PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitors in GC has not yet been maximized. Additionally, the effect of autophagy regulation by PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitors has not been clearly elucidated in GC treatment. We aimed to show that our newly developed PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor, CMG002, when combined with an autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ), potently induces effective cancer cell death in Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) cells, where both the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and autophagy pathways play important roles in disease pathogenesis. EBV- and mock-infected AGS and NUGC3 GC cell lines were treated with CMG002 +/− CQ. PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway mediators, cellular apoptosis and autophagy markers were confirmed by Western blot assay. Cell viability was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. CMG002 effectively blocked the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by markedly decreasing phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream mediator S6. CMG002 induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and enhanced apoptotic cell death in AGS and NUGC3 cells, particularly EBV-infected cells compared with mock-infected cells, as confirmed by flow cytometric analyses and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) assays. The combination of CMG002 plus CQ synergistically increased apoptotic cell death in EBV-infected GC cell lines when compared with CMG002 alone (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that the new PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor, CMG002, when used in combination with the autophagy inhibitor, CQ, provides enhanced therapeutic efficacy against EBVaGC.

Abstract: Summary
During mammalian embryogenesis, de novo hematopoiesis occurs transiently in multiple anatomical sites including the yolk sac, dorsal aorta, and heart tube. A long-unanswered question is whether these local transient hematopoietic mechanisms are essential for embryonic growth. Here, we show that endocardial hematopoiesis is critical for cardiac valve remodeling as a source of tissue macrophages. Colony formation assay from explanted heart tubes and genetic lineage tracing with the endocardial specific Nfatc1-Cre mouse revealed that hemogenic endocardium is a de novo source of tissue macrophages in the endocardial cushion, the primordium of the cardiac valves. Surface marker characterization, gene expression profiling, and ex vivo phagocytosis assay revealed that the endocardially derived cardiac tissue macrophages play a phagocytic and antigen presenting role. Indeed, genetic ablation of endocardially derived macrophages caused severe valve malformation. Together, these data suggest that transient hemogenic activity in the endocardium is indispensable for the valvular tissue remodeling in the heart.

Abstract: Summary
β2-integrins promote neutrophil recruitment to infected tissues and are crucial for host defense. Neutrophil recruitment is defective in leukocyte adhesion deficiency type-1 (LAD1), a condition caused by mutations in the CD18 (β2-integrin) gene. Using a model of Citrobacter rodentium (CR)-induced colitis, we show that CD18−/− mice display increased intestinal damage and systemic bacterial burden, compared to littermate controls, ultimately succumbing to infection. This phenotype is not attributed to defective neutrophil recruitment, as it is shared by CXCR2−/− mice that survive CR infection. CR-infected CD18−/− mice feature prominent upregulation of IL-17 and downregulation of IL-22. Exogenous IL-22 administration, but not endogenous IL-17 neutralization, protects CD18−/− mice from lethal colitis. β2-integrin expression on macrophages is mechanistically linked to Rac1/ROS-mediated induction of noncanonical-NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3) inflammasome-dependent IL-1β production, which promotes ILC3-derived IL-22. Therefore, β2-integrins are required for protective IL-1β-dependent IL-22 responses in colitis, and the identified mechanism may underlie the association of human LAD1 with colitis.

Abstract: Summary
The decision to consume or reject a food based on the degree of acidity is critical for animal survival. However, the gustatory receptors that detect sour compounds and influence feeding behavior have been elusive. Here, using the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we reveal that a member of the ionotropic receptor family, IR7a, is essential for rejecting foods laced with high levels of acetic acid. IR7a is dispensable for repulsion of other acidic compounds, indicating that the gustatory sensation of acids occurs through a repertoire rather than a single receptor. The fly’s main taste organ, the labellum, is decorated with bristles that house dendrites of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). IR7a is expressed in a subset of bitter GRNs rather than GRNs dedicated to sour taste. Our findings indicate that flies taste acids through a repertoire of receptors, enabling them to discriminate foods on the basis of acid composition rather than just pH.

Abstract: Summary
CBX4, a component of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), plays important roles in the maintenance of cell identity and organ development through gene silencing. However, whether CBX4 regulates human stem cell homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CBX4 counteracts human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) aging via the maintenance of nucleolar homeostasis. CBX4 protein is downregulated in aged hMSCs, whereas CBX4 knockout in hMSCs results in destabilized nucleolar heterochromatin, enhanced ribosome biogenesis, increased protein translation, and accelerated cellular senescence. CBX4 maintains nucleolar homeostasis by recruiting nucleolar protein fibrillarin (FBL) and heterochromatin protein KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1) at nucleolar rDNA, limiting the excessive expression of rRNAs. Overexpression of CBX4 alleviates physiological hMSC aging and attenuates the development of osteoarthritis in mice. Altogether, our findings reveal a critical role of CBX4 in counteracting cellular senescence by maintaining nucleolar homeostasis, providing a potential therapeutic target for aging-associated disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Altered physiological states require neuronal adaptation. In late pregnancy and lactation, a sub-population of the mouse hypothalamic tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons alters their behavior to synthesize and release met-enkephalin rather than dopamine. These neurons normally release dopamine to inhibit prolactin secretion and are activated by prolactin in a short-loop feedback manner. In lactation, dopamine synthesis is suppressed in an opioid-dependent (naloxone-reversible) manner, meaning that prolactin secretion is disinhibited. Conditional deletion of the prolactin receptor in neurons reveals that this change in phenotype appears to be driven by prolactin itself, apparently through an alteration in intracellular signaling downstream of the prolactin receptor that favors enkephalin production instead of dopamine. Thus, prolactin effectively facilitates its own secretion, which is essential for lactation and maternal behavior. These studies provide evidence of a physiologically important, reversible alteration in the behavior of a specific population of hypothalamic neurons in the adult brain.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) are highly heterogeneous and engage in a wide range of diverse functions. Yet, the heterogeneities of their origins and functions remain incompletely defined. Here, we report the identification and characterization of an ectoderm-derived myeloid-like cell, which we refer to as metaphocyte. We show that metaphocytes are highly similar to conventional Langerhans cells (cLCs), the resident macrophages in epidermis, in transcriptome, morphology, and anatomic location. However, unlike cLCs, metaphocytes respond neither to tissue injury nor to bacterial infection but rather sample soluble antigens from external environment through transepithelial protrusions and transfer them to cLCs via apoptosis-phagocytosis axis. This antigen transfer is critical for zebrafish to respond to soluble antigens because the depletion of metaphocytes significantly reduces cLC antigen uptake. Our study documents the existence of ectoderm-derived myeloid-like cells that manifest distinct function from conventional TRMs and opens a new paradigm for investigation of the heterogeneities of resident immune cells.

Abstract: Summary
Interaction domains in Drosophila chromosomes form by segregation of active and inactive chromatin in the absence of CTCF loops, but the role of transcription versus other architectural proteins in chromatin organization is unclear. Here, we find that positioning of RNAPII via transcription elongation is essential in the formation of gene loops, which in turn interact to form compartmental domains. Inhibition of transcription elongation or depletion of cohesin decreases gene looping and formation of active compartmental domains. In contrast, depletion of condensin II, which also localizes to active chromatin, causes increased gene looping, formation of compartmental domains, and stronger intra-chromosomal compartmental interactions. Condensin II has a similar role in maintaining inter-chromosomal interactions responsible for pairing between homologous chromosomes, whereas inhibition of transcription elongation or cohesin depletion has little effect on homolog pairing. The results suggest distinct roles for cohesin and condensin II in the establishment of 3D nuclear organization in Drosophila.
