Abstract: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is caused by mutational inactivation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm) gene, which is involved in DNA repair. Increased oxidative stress has been shown in human AT cells and neuronal tissues of Atm-deficient mice. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an inducible antioxidant enzyme and protects cells against oxidative stress. The purpose of this study is to determine whether ATM induces antioxidant enzyme HO-1 and protects cells from oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis by driving the activation of PKC-δ and NF-κB, by increasing cell viability, and by downregulating DNA fragmentation and apoptotic indicators (apoptosis-inducing factor and cleaved caspase-3). AT fibroblasts stably transfected with human full-length ATM cDNA (YZ5 cells) or the empty vector (MOCK cells) were treated with H2O2 as a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a result, transfection with ATM inhibited ROS-induced cell death and DNA fragmentation in MOCK cells. Transfection with ATM induced expression of HO-1 which was mediated by PKC-δ and NF-κB in H2O2-treated MOCK cells. ZnPP, an HO-1 inhibitor, and transfection with HO-1 siRNA increased ROS levels and apoptosis, whereas hemin, an HO-1 activator, reduced ROS levels and apoptosis in H2O2-treated YZ5 cells. Rottlerin, a PKC-δ inhibitor, inhibited NF-κB activation and HO-1 expression in H2O2-treated YZ5 cells. MOCK cells showed increased cell death, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic indicators compared to YZ5 cells exposed to H2O2. In addition, transfection with p65 siRNA increased ROS levels and DNA fragmentation, but decreased HO-1 protein levels in H2O2-treated YZ5 cells. In conclusion, ATM induces HO-1 expression via activation of PKC-δ and NF-κB and inhibits oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. A loss of HO-1 induction may explain why AT patients are vulnerable to oxidative stress.

Abstract: Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) are multipotent cells capable of differentiating toward osteoblatic and adipocytic phenotypes. BM-MSCs play several key roles including bone remodeling, establishment of hematopoietic niche and immune tolerance induction. Here, we investigated the effect of resveratrol (RSV), a therapeutically promising natural polyphenol, on the commitment of human BM-MSCs primary cultures. Cell differentiation was evaluated by means of morphological analysis, specific staining and expression of osteogenic and adipocytic master genes (Runx-2, PPARγ). To maintain BM-MSC multipotency, all experiments were performed on cells at very early passages. At any concentration RSV, added to standard medium, did not affect the phenotype of confluent BM-MSCs, while, when added to osteogenic or adipogenic medium, 1μM RSV enhances the differentiation toward osteoblasts or adipocytes, respectively. Conversely, the addition of higher RSV concentration (25μM) to both differentiation media resulted exclusively in BM-MSCs adipogenesis. Surprisingly, the analysis of RSV molecular effects demonstrated that the compound completely substitutes insulin, a key component of adipogenic medium. We also observed that RSV treatment is associated to enhanced phosphorylation of CREB, a critical effector of insulin adipogenic activity. Finally, our observations contribute to the mechanistic elucidation of the well-known RSV positive effect on insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: A single layer anti-reflective (AR) mesoporous silica nanoparticles coating on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells has been fabricated. Unlike traditional vacuum deposited AR coatings, this nanoparticle coating is applied using simple wet deposition techniques. In this study we investigate the structural properties and anti-reflection effects of the nanoparticle coating on the CIGS solar cell. The reduction in reflection and increase in the short circuit current shows the potential of this nanoparticle coating to compete with current technology.

Abstract: Bulk heterojunction films, which typically comprise a polymer donor and fullerene acceptor, are considerably stiffer than films of the neat polymer. The increase in stiffness upon blending is dependent on the miscibility of the polymer and the fullerene, and potentially on the details of molecular mixing, in particular, intercalation of the fullerene molecules between the polymer side chains. This paper describes the effects of molecular mixing on the tensile modulus of polythiophenes in 1:1 blends with [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). A series of four polymers and their blends with PC61BM are tested using mechanical, spectroscopic, and photovoltaic device-based measurements to determine if it is possible to predict trends in the tensile modulus based on the extent of molecular mixing. The four polymers are poly-2,2′:5′,2″-(3,3″-dihexyl-terthiophene) (PT2T), which forms an amorphous, molecularly mixed composite, poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (PBTTT), which forms a well ordered blend with bimolecular crystallization, and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(3-heptylthiophene) (P3HpT), which form a ternary blend with an amorphous mixed phase. The tensile moduli are measured by the buckling technique and correlations are found between the modulus of the neat polymer and the blends. Although spectroscopic and photovoltaic device-based measurements of P3HT:PC61BM and PT2T:PC61BM, along with literature precedent, suggest completely different extents of molecular mixing, they were found to have similar moduli (2.75±0.59GPa and 2.61±0.39GPa, after annealing). A strong correlation between the moduli of the blended films and the moduli of the neat polymers suggest that the stiffness of the blend is determined to a large extent by that of the polymer, and is unexpectedly insensitive to the details of molecular mixing, at least for the materials investigated.

Abstract: Polymer/small-molecule parallel-connected tandem organic solar cells are explored as a simple platform for high-efficiency tandem solar cells that are not subject to complications associated with complex current matching or successive solution processing. In particular, MoOx/Ag/MoOx (MAM) trilayer electrodes are investigated as an intermediate electrode that connects a front subcell composed of a solution-processed bulk heterojunction of poly{2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl) benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene-alt-5-dibutyloctyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione} (PBDTT-DPP) and the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and a back subcell composed of a thermally evaporated C70 layer doped with 1,1-bis-(4-bis(4-methyl-phenyl)-amino-phenyl)-cyclohexane (TAPC). The effect of each MoOx layer is analyzed in terms of both optical and electrical properties. A joint theoretical and experimental study indicates that the electric field is distributed along the cell depth such that the photogenerated current of the front subcell depends on the thickness of both MoOx layers, with a varied interference effect, and that of the back subcell depends primarily on the thickness of the adjacent MoOx layer, with a varied cavity resonance effect. Based on optimized conditions of MAM electrodes, parallel tandem hybrid organic solar cells having higher power conversion efficiency than that of single junction cells are successfully realized.

Abstract: Chromatin structure promotes important epigenetic mechanisms that regulate cellular fate by organizing, preserving and controlling the way by which the genetic information works. Our understanding of chromatin and its functions is sparse and not yet well defined. The uncertainty comes from the complexity of chromatin and is induced by the existence of a large number of nuclear proteins that influence it. The intricate interaction among all these structural and functional nuclear proteins has been under extensive study in the recent years. Here, we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone physically interacts with Arp4p (actin-related protein 4) which is a key subunit of three chromatin modifying complexes – INO80, SWR1 and NuA4. A single – point mutation in the actin – fold domain of Arp4p together with the knock-out of the gene for the linker histone in S. cerevisiae severely abrogates cellular and nuclear morphology and leads to complete disorganizing of the higher levels of chromatin organization.

Abstract: Light management is fundamental for achieving high performance thin-film silicon solar cells. We highlight important developments of light management for record modules subdivided into several main categories: (a) reduction of reflection at interfaces by introducing antireflective layers; (b) reduction of parasitic losses in transparent conductive oxide layers; (c) improvement of light scattering combined with transparent conductive oxide surface morphology optimization; and (d) balancing of top cell and bottom cell currents by reflective layers. Specific aspects related to industrial production of large area modules are discussed including transparency/conductivity trade-offs, optimized deposition rates and coating uniformities.

Abstract: Minority carrier lifetime, τB, is one of the key metrics for polycrystalline solar cell absorbers. Based on different spatial carrier-generation profiles obtained using one-photon and two-photon excitation (1PE and 2PE, respectively), we developed a new approach to determine τB in polycrystalline thin films. By comparing time-resolved photoluminescence data measured with 1PE and 2PE, we extract τB and surface recombination velocity S, and resolve charge separation at the pn junction. For coevaporated kesterite (Cu2ZnSnSe4) absorbers, we find S=(0.8–2.1)×104cms−1 and τB=7.0±0.5ns. For corresponding photovoltaic devices, charge separation occurs in ≤2ns.

Abstract: Zirconia (ZrO2) is a well known oxide refractory material, possessing high strength and high melting point. Black zirconia is a variant of conventional zirconia obtained by the addition of a pigments percentage which changes its color from white to black. The present work shows, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, optical spectra of black ZrO2 in the range 0.3–16.3µm, comparing them to those of a conventional white stoichometric sample. Moreover, preliminary data on the high temperature emittance of black ZrO2 are shown as well.

Abstract: Building Integrated Concentrating Photovoltaics (BICPV) is a promising solution leading toward self-sustaining buildings. In this work, we have evaluated the performance of one such system carrying out detailed modeling and indoor experiments. The system has a geometric concentration of 6× and typically consists of a dielectric based Symmetric Elliptical Hyperboloid (SEH) concentrating element attached to a silicon solar cell. The incoming light incident on the top surface is concentrated and reaches the solar cell in a non-uniform fashion. Part of this concentrated light is converted to electricity and rest is dissipated in the form of heat. In order to analyze the performance of such a system, a coupled optical, electrical and thermal analysis is required. Using the non-uniform flux distribution obtained by the optical analysis, the electrical modeling of the solar cell is carried out at different incident angles. Modeling showed a maximum power ratio of 3.7 which is in line with the experimental values under a constant solar cell temperature. Several loss mechanisms occur in the system under actual operating conditions. Losses occurring due to the absorption of light over a range of spectrum were quantified by performing an External Quantum efficiency analysis. The losses occurring due to the solar cell temperature were evaluated while carrying out a coupled electrical and thermal analysis of the system. A maximum temperature of 319K was observed on the solar cell surface under normal incidence. An average drop of 11.7% was found making the effective power ratio of the system 3.4.

Abstract: Thin film CdTe solar cells were produced by MOCVD, at atmospheric pressure, under a hydrogen atmosphere (i.e. oxygen-free). Window layer alloying with zinc (forming Cd1−xZnxS) and extrinsic p-type doping with arsenic (giving CdTe:As) have been used to improve photovoltaic solar cell performances, but as-grown MOCVD-CdTe PV cells are still typically characterised by low Voc (~620–690mV). Post-deposition annealing in air for 30min at low temperature (170°C) prior to evaporation of the back contacts led to significant increases in Voc and FF. XPS measurements revealed back surface oxidation, resulting in formation of Te–O species. This was also the case for a device aged under ambient laboratory conditions. Extended annealing in air of a fresh device, for up to 180min, continued to improve both Voc and FF. At longer annealing times the Voc remained relatively stable whilst the FF started to deteriorate. External quantum efficiency showed loss of photocurrent generation after excessive oxidation prior to back contact metallisation. Controlled back surface oxidation resulted in Voc values exceeding 800mV and a best cell efficiency of 15.3%.

Abstract: The importance of mitochondria for a typical aerobic eukaryotic cell is undeniable, as the list of necessary mitochondrial processes is steadily growing. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of mitochondrial biology of an early-branching parasitic protist, Trypanosoma brucei, a causative agent of serious human and cattle diseases. We present a comprehensive survey of its mitochondrial pathways including kinetoplast DNA replication and maintenance, gene expression, protein and metabolite import, major metabolic pathways, Fe-S cluster synthesis, ion homeostasis, organellar dynamics, and other processes. As we describe in this chapter, the single mitochondrion of T. brucei is everything but simple and as such rivals mitochondria of multicellular organisms.

Abstract: 2′,2′-Difluoro-2′-deoxycytidine (dFdC, gemcitabine) is a cytidine analogue active against several solid tumor types, such as ovarian, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer. The compound has a complex mechanism of action. Because of the structural similarity of one metabolite of dFdC, dFdUMP, with the natural substrate for thymidylate synthase (TS) dUMP, we investigated whether dFdC and its deamination product 2′,2′-difluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (dFdU) would inhibit TS. This study was performed using two solid tumor cell lines: the human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780 and its dFdC-resistant variant AG6000. The specific TS inhibitor Raltitrexed (RTX) was included as a positive control. Using the in situ TS activity assay measuring the intracellular conversion of [5-3H]-2′-deoxyuridine or [5-3H]-2′-deoxycytidine to dTMP and tritiated water, it was observed that dFdC and dFdU inhibited TS. In A2780 cells after a 4h exposure to 1μM dFdC tritium release was inhibited by 50% but did not increase after 24h, Inhibition was also observed following dFdU at 100μM. No effect was observed in the dFdC-resistant cell line AG6000; in this cell line only RTX had an inhibitory effect on TS activity. In the A2780 cell line RTX inhibited TS in a time dependent manner. In addition, DNA specific compounds such as 2′-C-cyano-2′-deoxy-1-beta-D-arabino-pentafuranosylcytosine and aphidicoline were utilized to exclude DNA inhibition mediated down regulation of the thymidine kinase. Inhibition of the enzyme resulted in a relative increase of mis-incorporation of [5-3H]-2′-deoxyuridine into DNA. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of in situ TS inhibition the ternary complex formation and possible inhibition in cellular extracts of A2780 cells, before and after exposure to dFdC, were determined. With the applied methods no proof for formation of a stable complex was found. In simultaneously performed experiments with 5FU such a complex formation could be demonstrated. However, using purified TS it was demonstrated that dFdUMP and not dFdCMP competitively inhibited TS with a Ki of 130μM, without ternary complex formation. In conclusion, in this paper we reveal a new target of dFdC: thymidylate synthase.

Abstract: MiR-139-5p down-regulation has frequently been implicated in colorectal carcinoma. However, there is little known about its biological function between inflammation and cancer in vivo. Here, a transgenic murine model of colorectal carcinoma was used to investigate pathogenetic role of miR-139-5p in colitis and colitis-associated tumorigenesis. We showed that miR-139-5p knockout mice were higher sensitive to DSS-induced colitis and enhanced formation of intestinal neoplasia was observed when mice were exposed to AOM/DSS treatment. MiR-139-5p knockout mice exhibited an increased expression of genes involved in Wnt pathway. Such genes are closely associated with cell proliferation and differentiation, promoting the β-catenin nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, biochemical studies in HCT-116 cells revealed that the over-expression of miR-139-5p inhibited the crosstalk between PI3K/AKT and Wnt pathway mediated by IGF-1R. Collectively, these findings indicate that miR-139-5p plays a crucial role in the development and progression of colitis-associated tumorigenesis and suggest that miR-139-5p may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of colitis-associated cancer in the future.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an attractive target for cancer therapy due to its ability to selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells, without causing significant toxicity in normal tissues. We previously reported that galactoxyloglucan (PST001) possesses significant antitumor and immunomodulatory properties. However, the exact mechanism in mediating this anticancer effect is unknown. This study, for the first time, indicated that PST001 sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer (A549) and nasopharyngeal (KB) cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In vitro studies suggested that PST001 induced apoptosis primarily via death receptors and predominantly activated caspases belonging to the extrinsic apoptotic cascade. Microarray profiling of PST001 treated A549 and KB cells showed the suppression of survivin (BIRC5) and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, as well as increased cytochrome C. TaqMan low density array analysis of A549 cells also confirmed that the induction of apoptosis by the polysaccharide occurred through the TRAIL-DR4/DR5 pathways. This was finally confirmed by in silico analysis, which revealed that PST001 binds to TRAIL-DR4/DR5 complexes more strongly than TNF and Fas ligand–receptor complexes. In summary, our results suggest the potential of PST001 to be developed as an anticancer agent that not only preserves innate biological activity of TRAIL, but also sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

Abstract: The role of thermal cycling of inverted P3HT:PCBM-based polymer solar cells is reported. We found that thermal cycling between −40°C and 85°C up to 200 cycles had no significant effect on solar cell efficiency and mechanical integrity. On the contrary, the solar cells exhibited a slight increase in fracture resistance, similar to that reported for a post-electrode deposition thermal annealing at 85°C. Gc increased from 2.6J/m2 for our control solar cells to a sustained maximum value of 4.0J/m2 after 25 thermal cycles. Surface analysis on the fractured samples revealed the formation of an intermixed layer between P3HT:PCBM and PEDOT:PSS, causing the debond path to change from adhesive between P3HT:PCBM and PEDOT:PSS to meandering through the intermixed layer. A kinetic analysis was used to model the effect of thermal cycling on the Gc values of polymer cells. The model revealed for cycling between −40°C and 85°C that 25 cycles are needed to reach the maximum Gc, which is consistent with our experimental results. After 5 thermal cycles, the effects of heating and cooling have little impact on the mechanical stability of polymer solar cells.

Abstract: Cell culture techniques are essential for studying host–pathogen interactions. In addition to the broad range of single cell type-based two-dimensional cell culture models, an enormous amount of coculture systems, combining two or more different cell types, has been developed. These systems enable microscopic visualization and molecular analyses of bacterial adherence and internalization mechanisms and also provide a suitable setup for various biochemical, immunological, and pharmacological applications. The implementation of natural or synthetical scaffolds elevated the model complexity to the level of three-dimensional cell culture. Additionally, several transwell-based cell culture techniques are applied to study bacterial interaction with physiological tissue barriers. For keeping highly differentiated phenotype of eukaryotic cells in ex vivo culture conditions, different kinds of microgravity-simulating rotary-wall vessel systems are employed. Furthermore, the implementation of microfluidic pumps enables constant nutrient and gas exchange during cell cultivation and allows the investigation of long-term infection processes. The highest level of cell culture complexity is reached by engineered and explanted tissues which currently pave the way for a more comprehensive view on microbial pathogenicity mechanisms.

Abstract: Advanced light management currently plays an important role in high-performance solar cells. In this paper, a HAZO/AZO structure that was produced using RF-magnetron sputtering with segmented hydrogen mediation was proposed to further simultaneously enhance the transmittance and light trapping capability at full solar spectrum. Compared to the standard AZO front contact, the total transmittance at short wavelength and haze at full spectrum were remarkably enhanced by 5.1% and 20.7%, respectively. Additionally, the resistivity of the HAZO/AZO structure was enhanced by 16.9%. When applied as front electrodes, the spectral response of a-Si:H and μc-Si:H solar cells increased. The quantum efficiency of the a-Si:H solar cell improved by 7.9% (from 59% to 66.9%) at 400nm. An initial efficiency of 8.69% with Jsc over 27mA/cm2 was obtained for the μc-Si:H solar cell. Finally, an a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H/μc-Si:H triple-junction solar cell was obtained with the initial efficiency over 15%, which illustrates a promising and potentially cost-effective alternative structure to further improve the high-quality transparent electrodes for high-efficiency thin-film solar cells.

Abstract: Semiconductor films play a crucial role when it comes to modern solar-based technologies to generate electricity, produce solar fuels, or convert the environmental pollutants to other harmless materials. In this paper, using an interesting simple as well as versatile electrochemical route, a nanocomposite Cu/Zn/Sn oxide semiconductor film was fabricated on a fluorine doped tin oxide glass and investigated as a photocathode of quantum dot solar cells in a sulfide/polysulfide electrolyte solution. X-ray diffraction analyses revealed a composite nature for this electrodeposited film. A broadband light absorption was witnessed and the band gap (1.63eV) was determined through Tauc׳s procedure. Scanning electron micrographs exhibited a non-smooth morphology for this composite film, which provides a greater area for heterogeneous reactions occurring upon the electrode surface. Mott–Schottky and potentiodynamic polarization plots indicated that the fabricated electrode acts as a complex p-type photocathode. The electrochemical impedance studies proved that under light irradiation, by photo-generation of charge carriers (electron-hole), the interfacial charge transfer resistance decreases and the cathodic current becomes consequently enhanced. After coating (photodeposition) with silver, a complicated photoelectrochemical response was finally observed and the findings were explained in detail.

Abstract: High-efficiency solar cell technologies rely on a sound knowledge of interface engineering and characterization on an atomic scale. Electrical interface recombination losses are closely related to structural and chemical properties of passivation layers. Ultra-thin silicon oxide layers (thickness about 1nm, often referred to as tunnel oxide layers) applied in the recently introduced TOPCon cell concept and ALD passivation techniques require advanced techniques in characterization of layer thickness and homogeneity. Furthermore, the interface properties seem to play an important role for PID solar cell reliability. Within this paper, we have a methodological focus on ultrathin silicon oxide layer characterization both from a preparative and analytical point of view. We show results on atomically resolved imaging of passivation layers and related chemical and electrical properties. The thickness of silicon oxide layers which lies in the low nm range is measured by TEM and angle-resolved XPS. The preparation of TEM samples was done by wedge polishing including final Ar+ ion polishing. Further preparation steps are required to inhibit further oxidation. From the comparison of TEM and XPS for thickness measurement results that layer thickness can be determined with an accuracy of 0.35nm. These thickness values are compared to data obtained by spectral ellipsometry. The chemical composition of interfaces and stoichiometric composition of SiOx interface layers was analyzed by means of TEM, XPS and ToF-SIMS. The elemental depth resolution of all methods was compared. Finally, the silicon oxidation state was investigated by XPS as a function of layer thickness addressing both interfacial and thin film oxidation states. The presence of subsurface oxides is investigated depending on annealing processes.

Abstract: Acidic solution texture by HF/HNO3 has been wildly used for the multicrystalline-Si (mc-Si) solar cell mass production. But, acidic texturing is difficult for the diamond wire sawn wafer, because the damage layer does not homogeneously distribute on the diamond wire sawn wafer. Metal catalyst texture (MCT) using silver nitrate (AgNO3) is effective method even though the diamond wire sawn wafer. The texture with metal catalyst reaction is spontaneously formed irrespective of the wafer surface condition. In this article, fine texture structure is demonstrated for the diamond wire sawn wafer by the MCT method, texture structure is possible to control easily by changing the immersion time in the reaction container. The cell conversion efficiency for the diamond wire sawn wafer by the MCT is as high as that for the slurry wire sawn wafer by the acidic texture. The MCT is effective method for both the slurry and diamond wire sawn wafer. The MCT method will especially become most possible alternative candidate for the diamond wire sawn wafer.

Abstract: Engineered minichromosomes are small chromosomes that contain a transgene and selectable marker, as well as all of the necessary components required for maintenance in an organism separately from the standard chromosome set. The separation from endogenous chromosomes makes engineered minichromosomes useful in the production of transgenic plants. Introducing transgenes to minichromosomes does not have the risk of insertion within a native gene; additionally, transgenes on minichromosomes can be transferred between lines without the movement of linked genes. Of the two methods proposed for creating engineered minichromosomes, telomere-mediated truncation is more reliable in plant systems. Additionally, many plants contain a supernumerary, or B chromosome, which is an excellent starting material for minichromosome creation. The use of site-specific recombination systems in minichromosomes can increase their utility, allowing for the addition or subtraction of transgenes in vivo. The creation of minichromosomes with binary bacterial artificial chromosome vectors provides the ability to introduce many transgenes at one time. Furthermore, coupling minichromosomes with haploid induction systems can facilitate transfer between lines. Minichromosomes can be introduced to a haploid-inducing line and crossed to target lines. Haploids of the target line that then contain a minichromosome can then be doubled. These homozygous lines will contain the transgene without the need for repeated introgressions.

Abstract: This article studies new binary eutectic mixtures of sugar alcohols for their use as phase change materials (PCMs) in the 50–90°C temperature range. This range is suitable for domestic solar thermal systems and cogeneration devices. The mixtures studied were composed of erythritol and xylitol, erythritol and sorbitol, and xylitol and sorbitol. Their phase diagrams were experimentally established by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction. Polarized thermomicroscopy was employed to determine the crystallization rate of the pure materials and eutectic compositions. Additionally, the polymorphic behavior of the pure materials was assessed and compared with data from the literature. The results showed that, with respect to thermal properties and economic aspects, the eutectic compositions found are suitable for the intended purpose. Unfortunately, their crystallization rates are noticeably low, which limits their use as PCMs. A modeling approach based on thermodynamics was used to predict solid–liquid equilibria of the studied mixtures and their melting enthalpies. The simulated results were in good agreement with experimental results. The modeled and experimental results were finally used to highlight a few practical aspects relevant for the development of new eutectic mixture-based PCMs.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is required for efficient repair of cytotoxic DNA lesions in Escherichia coli,

Abstract: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a multifunctional protein with diverse biological functions in human cells. In bacteria, moonlighting GAPDH functions have only been described for the secreted protein in pathogens or probiotics. At the intracellular level, we previously reported the interaction of Escherichia coli GAPDH with phosphoglycolate phosphatase, a protein involved in the metabolism of the DNA repair product 2-phosphoglycolate, thus suggesting a putative role of GAPDH in DNA repair processes. Here, we provide evidence that GAPDH is required for the efficient repair of DNA lesions in E. coli. We show that GAPDH-deficient cells are more sensitive to bleomycin or methyl methanesulfonate. In cells challenged with these genotoxic agents, GAPDH deficiency results in reduced cell viability and filamentous growth. In addition, the gapA knockout mutant accumulates a higher number of spontaneous abasic sites and displays higher spontaneous mutation frequencies than the parental strain. Pull-down experiments in different genetic backgrounds show interaction between GAPDH and enzymes of the base excision repair pathway, namely the AP-endonuclease Endo IV and uracil DNA glycosylase. This finding suggests that GAPDH is a component of a protein complex dedicated to the maintenance of genomic DNA integrity. Our results also show interaction of GAPDH with the single-stranded DNA binding protein. This interaction may recruit GAPDH to the repair sites and implicates GAPDH in DNA repair pathways activated by profuse DNA damage, such as homologous recombination or the SOS response.

Abstract: The Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is an essential cellular protein that is involved in cell–cell adhesion, protein trafficking, and viral infection. The major isoform of CAR is selectively sorted to the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells where it co-localizes with the cellular scaffolding protein membrane-associated guanylate kinase with inverted domain structure-1 (MAGI-1). Previously, we demonstrated CAR interacts with MAGI-1 through a PDZ–domain dependent interaction. Here, we show that the PDZ3 domain of MAGI-1 is exclusively responsible for the high affinity interaction between the seven exon isoform of CAR and MAGI-1 using yeast-two-hybrid analysis and confirming this interaction biochemically and in cellular lysates by in vitro pull down assay and co-immunoprecipitation. The high affinity interaction between the PDZ3 domain and CAR C-terminus was measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Further, we investigated the biological relevance of this high affinity interaction between CAR and the PDZ3 domain of MAGI-1 and found that it does not alter CAR-mediated adenovirus infection. By contrast, interruption of this high affinity interaction altered the localization of MAGI-1 indicating that CAR is able to traffic MAGI-1 to cell junctions. These data deepen the molecular understanding of the interaction between CAR and MAGI-1 and indicate that although CAR plays a role in trafficking PDZ-based scaffolding proteins to cellular junctions, association with a high affinity intracellular binding partner does not significantly alter adenovirus binding and entry via CAR.

Abstract: The treatment of hydrogenated intrinsic amorphous silicon oxide (i-a-SiOx:H) films by H2 plasma is found through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to significantly improve the quality of the layers, which is attributed to variation in the Si–Hn bonding structure and an improvement of bonding order. Meanwhile, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results indicate that the initial growth of a hydrogenated intrinsic amorphous silicon (i-a-Si:H) layer deposited on a treated i-a-SiOx:H film is also improved, which is beneficial to the performance of solar cells deposited on highly textured front electrodes. By inserting an i-a-SiOx:H film that is optimized in terms of H2 plasma treatment time as a p/i buffer layer in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cell, a significant increase in fill factor and open-circuit voltage are also observed. In this way, a high initial conversion efficiency of 11.3% can be achieved in a single-junction a-Si:H solar cell with an active layer thickness of 300nm.

Abstract: We report angle resolved characterization of nanostructured and conventionally textured silicon solar cells. The nanostructured solar cells are realized through a single step, mask-less, scalable reactive ion etching (RIE) texturing of the surface. Photovoltaic properties including short circuit current, open circuit voltage, fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency are each measured as function of the relative incident angle between the solar cell and the light source. The relative incident angle is varied from 0° to 90° in steps of 10° in orthogonal axes, such that each solar cell is characterized at 100 different angle combinations. The angle resolved photovoltaic properties are summarized in terms of the average, angle-dependent electrical power output normalized to the power output at normal incidence and differently textured cells on different silicon substrates are compared in terms of angle resolved performance. The results show a 3% point improvement in average electrical power output normalized with respect to normal incidence power output of RIE textured, multicrystalline Si cells compared to conventional multicrystalline Si cells and above 1% point improvement of RIE textured monocrystalline Si cells compared to conventional monocrystalline Si cells.

Abstract: Concentrating solar power is becoming an increasingly important part of the renewable energy portfolio. However, further cost reduction is desired to make CSP competitive with traditional energy technologies. Higher operating temperature is considered an attractive avenue leading to higher power conversion efficiency and lower cost, but tremendous technical challenges exist with higher temperature operation of CSP, with one of the main issues being the lack of a high-performance solar absorbing material that is durable at 750°C or above. In this work, a black oxide material, made of cobalt oxide nanoparticles, is synthesized and utilized as a high-temperature solar absorbing material. The nanoparticles are embedded in a dielectric matrix through a scalable spray coating process. The top layer of the coating is further improved with light-trapping structures using sacrificial fillers introduced from the same coating process. After the surface modification of cobalt oxide coating, we achieved a high thermal efficiency of 88.2%. More importantly, the coating shows no degradation after 1000-h annealing at 750°C in air, while the existing commercial light absorbing coating was reported to degrade by long-term exposure at high temperature. Our findings suggest that the materials and processes developed here are promising for solar absorbing coating for future high-temperature CSP systems.

Abstract: Tropomyosin is a major regulatory protein of contractile systems and cytoskeleton, an actin-binding protein that positions laterally along actin filaments and modulates actin–myosin interaction. About 40 tropomyosin isoforms have been found in a variety of cytoskeleton systems, not necessarily connected with actin–myosin interaction and contraction. Involvement of specific tropomyosin isoforms in the regulation of key cell processes was shown, and specific features of tropomyosin genes and protein structure have been investigated with molecular biology and genetics approaches. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of tropomyosin on cytoskeleton dynamics are still unclear. As tropomyosin is primarily an F-actin-binding protein, it is important to understand how it interacts both with actin and actin-binding proteins functioning in muscles and cytoskeleton to regulate actin dynamics. This review focuses on biochemical data on the effects of tropomyosin on actin assembly and dynamics, as well as on the modulation of these effects by actin-binding proteins. The data indicate that tropomyosin can efficiently regulate actin dynamics via allosteric conformational changes within actin filaments.

Abstract: The immune system is based on the actions of the collection of specialized immune defense cells and their secreted proteins and peptides that defend the host against infection by parasites. Parasites are organisms that live part or all of their lives in close physical association with the host and extract nutrients from the host and, by releasing toxins and virulence factors, cause disease with the potential for injury and premature death of that host. Parasites of the metazoa can be viruses, eubacteria, fungi, protozoans, and other metazoans. The immune system operates to kill or eliminate parasites and eliminate or detoxify their toxins and virulence factors. Although some of the elements of immune systems are specific to a particular phylum of metazoans, others show extensive evolutionary conservation, being present in several or all major phyla of the metazoa. The pentraxins display this latter character in their roles in immune defense. Pentraxins have been documented in vertebrates, nonvertebrate chordates, arthropods, and mollusks and may be present in other taxa of metazoans. Presumably the pentraxins appeared early in the evolution of metazoa, prior to their evolutionary divergence in the Precambrian epoch into many phyla present today, and have been preserved for the 542 million years since that explosive evolutionary radiation. The fidelity with which these phyla have preserved the pentraxins suggests that the functions of these proteins are important for survival of the members of these diverse taxa of animals.

Abstract: Stacked WO3/Ag/WO3 (WAW) films were employed as both transparent electrodes and electrochromic materials. These nontoxic, low-cost WAW films that were prepared at room temperature exhibited not only low sheet resistance (12.2Ω/□) and high transmittance (>80%) but also compelling electrochromic performance with high optical contrast (53%) at 650nm, long-term cycling stability (3000 cycles), and short switching time (coloration time=11s; bleaching time=10.5s). The coloration efficiency of the WAW films was 136cm2 C–1, which is higher than those of most electrochromic transition metal oxides. In addition, by utilizing such bi-functional films, the flexible electrochromic film with acceptable performance was obtained.

Abstract: In this work the potential of thin manganese oxide layers deposited by physical vapor deposition at moderate vacuum pressure to significantly retard the corrosion of silicon photo-anodes during the oxidation of water is reported. Results show that manganese oxide layers up to 10nm thick display sufficient transmission of solar frequency radiation and electrical conductivity to facilitate efficient oxidation of water by the underlying silicon while offering complete protection from oxidation of the silicon substrate for more than 14h. Data from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms that the increased lifetime observed when using manganese oxide as a protective layer is a result of the inhibition of the growth of silicon oxide during the reaction.

Abstract: The investigation is aimed at elaboration of technology for submicron p+-GaAs layer formation on micro/nanotextured n-GaAs substrates by using low-temperature (550°C) diffusion of zinc to take the advantage of optical and recombination properties of textured interface for solar cells. Process duration, surface microrelief morphology (dendrite or quasi-grating (grating-like)) and the substrate doping impurity concentration were varied. Optical, photoelectric and electrical properties of p+–n junction were studied to optimize the process conditions. The highest efficiency was obtained in structures with a quasi-grating surface microrelief, substrate doping close to Nd≃1017cm−3 and process duration about 45min.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynecological malignancy. Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of ovarian cancer is critical to provide new targeted therapeutic strategies. Recent evidence supports a role for Notch in ovarian cancer progression and associates its dysregulation to poor overall survival. Similarly, CXCR4/SDF1α signalling correlates with ovarian cancer progression and metastasis. Recent findings indicate that Notch promotes CXCR4/SDF1α signalling and its effect on cell growth and migration; nonetheless, up to now, the association between Notch and CXCR4/SDFα in ovarian cancer has not been reported. Thereby, the aim of this study was to investigate if Notch and CXCR4/SDF1α cooperate in determining ovarian cancer growth, survival and migration. To address this issue, Notch signalling was inhibited by using γ-secretase inhibitors, or upregulated by forcing of Notch1 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines. Our results indicated that Notch activity influenced tumour cell growth and survival and positively regulated CXCR4 and SDF1α expression. CXCR4/SDF1α signalling mediated the effect of Notch pathway on ovarian cancer cell growth and SDF1α-driven migration. Additionally, for the first time, we demonstrated that Notch signalling activation can be detected in ovarian cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry analysis of the Notch transcriptional target, HES6 and is positively correlated with high expression levels of CXCR4 and SDF1α. Our results demonstrate that Notch affects ovarian cancer cell biology through the modulation of CXCR4/SDF1α signalling and suggest that Notch inhibition may be a rationale therapeutic approach to hamper ovarian cancer progression mediated by the CXCR4/SDF1α axis.

Abstract: More than as an inert separation between the inside and outside of the nucleus, the nuclear envelope (NE) constitutes an active toll, which controls the import and export of molecules, and also a hub for a diversity of genomic processes, such as transcription, DNA repair, and chromatin dynamics. Proteins localized at the inner surface of the NE (such as lamins, nuclear pore proteins, lamin-associated proteins) interact with chromatin in a dynamic manner, contributing to the establishment of topological domains. In this review, we address the complex interplay between chromatin and NE. We discuss the divergence of this cross talk during evolution and comment both on the current established models and the most recent findings. In particular, we focus our attention on how the NE cooperates with chromatin in protecting the genome integrity.

Abstract: A previously published fluorene based interlayer polymer is here compared to three similar polymers where the fluorene monomer has been exchanged with monomers that have been reported to have a higher photo-chemical stability. The polymer interlayers have been studied in terms of their influence on device performance and stability on inverted devices with an active layer of P3HT:PC61BM. By acting as a hole-blocking layer the polymers are able to increase the efficiency of the devices with ~50% compared to devices with an ITO cathode. In addition, the polymers also improve the photo-stability of the devices, mainly as an effect of a reduced decrease in open-circuit voltage and fill factor. This indicates that solution processable polymer interlayers could be a way towards both higher efficiency and improved stability of inverted organic solar cells.

Abstract: Angiogenin (ANG), a member of the secreted ribonuclease family, is a potent angiogenesis stimulator that interacts with endothelial cells inducing a wide range of responses. Metal ions dyshomeostasis play a fundamental role in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular copper that is also involved in angiogenesis processes. It is known that vascular pathologies are present in neurodegenerative diseases and Angiogenin is down-regulated in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, as well as it has been found as one of the mutated genes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Copper (II) induces an increase of Angiogenin binding to endothelial cells but, so far, the relationship between copper-ANG and angiogenesis induction remain unclear. Herein, the effects of copper (II) ions on Angiogenin activity and expression were evaluated. The binding of copper was demonstrated to affect the intracellular localization of the protein decreasing its nuclear translocation. Moreover, the ANG-copper (II) system negatively affects the protein-induced angiogenesis, as well as endothelial cells migration. Surprisingly, copper also reveals the ability to modulate the Angiogenin transcription. These results highlight the tight relationship between copper and Angiogenin, pointing out the biological relevance of ANG-copper system in the regulation of endothelial cell function, and revealing a possible new mechanism at the basis of vascular pathologies.

Abstract: Considerable research supports a model in which hydrolytic enzymes of mammalian lysosomes are sorted to their destinations in a receptor-dependent mechanism. The ligand for the mammalian sorting receptors is mannose 6-phosphate (M6P). Two M6P receptors have been defined in mammals. Here, we review the foundational evidence supporting this mechanism and highlight the remaining gaps in our understanding of the mammalian mechanism, including evidence for M6P-independent sorting, and its relevance to lysosomal enzyme sorting in metazoa.

Abstract: Protein kinase CK2 plays an essential role in cell viability in lower and higher eukaryotes. As a global regulator it phosphorylates and thereby regulates a broad array of cellular targets including a large number of transcription factors. Here, we have identified the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein δ (C/EBPδ) as a new substrate for CK2. Using point mutants of C/EBPδ the major phosphorylation site for CK2 was mapped to serine 57, which is located within the transactivation domain of C/EBPδ. For proper functioning as a transcription factor C/EBPδ has to be translocated into the nucleus where it forms heterodimers with other members of the C/EBP family of proteins and ATF4. Here, we found that CK2 phosphorylation does neither influence the subcellular localization of C/EBPδ nor its interaction with C/EBPβ, but rather does CK2 phosphorylation modulate the transcriptional activity of C/EBPδ. Moreover, we found that CK2 bound to C/EBPδ, which might help to target CK2 to the transcriptional machinery where it can phosphorylate other transcription factors or co-activators.

Abstract: Raman scattering and atomic force microscopy measurements on Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films prepared by a direct solution method revealed that metal sulfates of various morphologies (dense clusters or separated particles) were partially embedded on the surface of the Cu2ZnSnS4 layer. This residue was removed during the subsequent chemical bath deposition of the CdS buffer layer. However, the removal of the residue led to poor crystallinity and reduced photocurrent near the location of the residue, which suggests that controlling the formation of the sulfates during the fabrication of the absorber layer would be critical for obtaining high efficiency solar cells by the solution method.

Alpha-synuclein overexpression negatively regulates insulin receptor substrate 1 by activating mTORC1/S6K1 signaling,

Abstract: Alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies, a pathological feature of Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as synucleinopathies. Among the possible mechanisms of α-Syn-mediated neurotoxicity is interference with cytoprotective pathways such as insulin signaling. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 is a docking protein linking IRs to downstream signaling pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K)1; the latter exerts negative feedback control on insulin signaling, which is impaired in Alzheimer's disease. Our previous study found that α-Syn overexpression can inhibit protein phosphatase (PP)2A activity, which is involved in the protective mechanism of insulin signaling. In this study, we found an increase in IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser636 and decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation, which accelerated IRS-1 turnover and reduced insulin-Akt signaling in α-Syn-overexpressing SK-N-SH cells and transgenic mice. The mTOR complex (C)1/S6K1 blocker rapamycin inhibited the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser636 in cells overexpressing α-Syn, suggesting that mTORC1/S6K1 activation by α-Syn causes feedback inhibition of insulin signaling via suppression of IRS-1 function. α-Syn overexpression also inhibited PP2A activity, while the PP2A agonist C2 ceramide suppressed both S6K1 activation and IRS-1 Ser636 phosphorylation upon α-Syn overexpression. Thus, α-Syn overexpression negatively regulated IRS-1 via mTORC1/S6K1 signaling while activation of PP2A reverses this process. These results provide evidence for a link between α-Syn and IRS-1 that may represent a novel mechanism for α-Syn-associated pathogenesis.

Abstract: NIR irradiation accounts for 52% of the solar irradiance energy reaching the earth, most of which is transferred to thermal energy. This work was undertaken in order to investigate the possibility of applying NIR reflective coatings on cotton fabric with the purpose of surface temperature reduction when irradiated with solar light. Commercial titania was modified by means of calcination treatments. Phase transition from anatase to rutile and growth in particle size were induced, and both processes resulted in an increase of NIR reflectance of the calcined TiO2. Irregular-shaped TiO2 particles with sizes of 293–618nm were obtained. The highest solar reflectance occurred in the TiO2 sample with an anatase:rutile ratio of 35:65 and a particle diameter of 563nm. By applying the NIR reflective coating consisting of calcined TiO2 on cotton fabric, a lower surface temperature was recorded with a maximum difference of 3.9°C. It was found that a chitosan-TiO2 coating could provide a better wash fastness than TiO2 alone.

Abstract: A novel AlCrNO-based solar selective absorbing coating was prepared by cathodic arc plating. The coating exhibited excellent selective absorbing properties with an absorptance of 0.93 and an emittance of 0.20. To test the in air thermal stability of this coating, the sample was annealed at 500°C for 100h in air. Experimental results indicated that the coating was highly stable in air at 500°C, as the absorptance/emittance of the coating kept almost unchanged (0.94/0.22) after 100h annealing. The microstructure of the coating was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), atomic force microscope (AFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

Abstract: Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is the most promising of third generation solar cells for large scale applications due its low cost, flexibility, and scalable manufacturability. However, enhancing the efficiency of the DSSC is still highly desired. In this study, we designed a novel bifacial DSSC based on a transparent Polyaniline (PANI) films as counter electrode (CE) associated with coral-like TiO2 nanostructured films, which can be used as the photoanode. PANI-based CEs were prepared by a facile in situ polymerization, while coral-like TiO2 films were chemically synthesized at low temperature through the sol–gel process. Owing to the light irradiation from both the front and the rear sides, it is expected that higher density of dye molecules should be excited. In addition, due to the excellent light scattering of the coal-like TiO2 and high specific surface area of PANI nanofibers (NFs), more carriers are generated. Both these factors resulted in the increase of the conversion efficiency. The bifacial DSSC fabricated by combining the PANI NFs-based film and the coral-like TiO2 film in the presence of the expensive N719 dye molecules showed the efficiency of 8.22% corresponding to the both-side irradiation. In comparison, similar cells employing either a cross-linked PANI- or Pt-based CE showed efficiencies of 7.81% and 7.75%, respectively. The results of the similar cells in the presence of the low cost CoPC dye molecules showed efficiencies of 0.29%, 0.22%, and 0.27%, for DSSCs comprised of PANI NFs-, cross-linked PANI-, and Pt-based CEs, respectively. The low fabrication cost as well as the improved light absorption highlights the potential application of the coral-like TiO2 and PANI NFs-based films in fabrication of bifacial DSSCs.

Abstract: Protein N-terminal acetylation is catalyzed by N-terminal acetyltransferases and represents one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotes. An increasing number of studies report on the importance of N-terminal acetylation for protein degradation, complex formation, subcellular targeting, and protein folding. N-terminal acetyltransferases are recognized to play important roles in a diversity of cellular processes like apoptosis, cell proliferation, sister chromatid cohesion, and chromatin silencing and are even linked to the development of rare genetic disorders and cancer. This article summarizes our current knowledge on the implications of N-terminal acetylation at the protein, cellular, and physiological levels.

Abstract: The present paper demonstrates the possibility of replacing indium–tin oxide (ITO) with heavily boron-doped diamond (BDD). Plasma Enhanced Chemically Vapor Deposited BDDs layers of various thicknesses were prepared containing various boron concentrations in a gas phase. The dependence of the above-mentioned parameters on the optical and electrical properties of each BDD was studied in order to achieve optimal conditions for the effective application of diamond electrodes in organic electronics as a replacement for ITO. Bulk-heterojunction polymer–fullerene organic solar cells were fabricated to test the potency of BDD application in photovoltaic devices. The obtained results demonstrated the possibility of the aforementioned application. Even though the efficiency of BDD-based devices is lower compared to those using regular ITO-based architecture, the relevant issues were explained.

Abstract: A high contrast, self-standing, and thermoplastic solid polymer electrolyte (PE) with electrochromic property is fabricated by utilizing N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), heptyl viologen (HV(BF4)2), succinonitrile (SN), and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP). Various amounts of the ionic liquid (IL, BMIMBF4) are added into the PE, and the amount of IL is found to play an important role in affecting the ionic conductivity, morphology, and thus electrochemical property of the obtained PE. The IL content in the PE is optimized in order to achieve a better electrochemical and electrochromic properties of the obtained electrochromic device (ECD). The effect of the IL content in PE on the electrochemical and electrochromic properties of the ECD is discussed in terms of the ionic conductivity and morphology of the PE. The optimized ECD, which uses the PE containing 5wt% IL, exhibits a reversible transmittance change of 60.1% at 615nm during the switching between 0 and 0.9V with a promising long-term stability; both the transmittance change and the long-term stability of the ECD using the PE containing 5wt% IL are much better than that using the PE without IL.

Abstract: This paper presents the experimental demonstration of silicon solar cells that incorporate an enhanced MIS passivated contact scheme on a phosphorus diffused surface. By depositing intrinsic a-Si:H on an ultrathin SiOx layer and alloying with an overlying aluminium layer, the interface passivation has been vastly improved over that of conventional MIS contacts, whilst maintaining a low contact resistance. This paper focuses on the optimisation of the Al/a-Si:H alloying process and the influence of the tunnelling SiOx layer thickness. A conversion efficiency of 21.0% has been achieved for n-type cells fabricated with a front boron diffusion and a full area rear MIS passivated phosphorus diffusion. The cells exhibit a moderate Voc=666mV and FF=0.805, whereas Jsc 39.3mA/cm2 is relatively low due to a non-optimal antireflection coating and back surface reflector, and hence will be subject to further improvement.

Abstract: Low thermal emittance is the key factor of a solar collector. For high temperature solar thermal applications, low emittance is an important parameter, because the thermal radiative losses of the absorbers increase proportionally by T4. Our primary motivation for carrying out this work has been to lower the thermal emittance of stainless steel substrate (intrinsic emittance=0.12–0.13) by coating a thin film of high infrared (IR) reflecting tungsten (W). Tungsten thin films were deposited on stainless steel substrates using a glow discharge direct current magnetron sputtering system. Emittance as low as 0.03 was obtained by varying the thickness of W coating on stainless steel substrate. The influences of structural, morphological and electrical properties of the W coating on its emittance values are studied. The effect of substrate roughness on the emittance of W coating is also examined. Thermal stability of the W coatings is studied in both vacuum and air. In order to demonstrate the effect of W interlayer, solar selective coating of AlTiN/AlTiON/AlTiO tandem absorber was deposited on W coated stainless steel substrates, which exhibited absorptance of 0.955 and emittance of 0.08 with a thermal stability up to 600°C in vacuum.

Abstract: The traditional microencapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) only have a single function of thermal energy storage. In this study, we designed and synthesized a new type of PCMs-based microcapsules containing an n-eicosane core and ZrO2 shell with the dual-functional characteristics of latent-heat storage/release and photoluminescence. The chemical structures and compositions of the resultant microcapsules were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. These microcapsules exhibited a spherical morphology with a uniform size distribution and well-defined core–shell structure according to the observation of scanning and transmission electronic microscopy. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed that only the amorphous ZrO2 shell was formed in the sol–gel process. However, the F− ions could induce the phase transition from the amorphous ZrO2 shell to the crystalline one consisting of monoclinic and tetragonal phases. The photoluminescence characterization indicated that the microcapsules with the crystalline ZrO2 shell could generate the purple-colored and green-colored luminescence after excited by UV radiation at a wavelength of 296nm, whereas only the green-colored luminescence was recorded after excitation toward the microcapsules with the amorphous shell. Most of all, the dual-functional microcapsules revealed good phase-change properties, and meanwhile, they achieved a high thermal-storage capability, high thermal reliability, and good thermal stability as a result of encapsulation of the compact ZrO2 shell. The dual-functional microcapsules developed by this work show potential applications for intelligent fibers or textiles, electronic devices, thermosensitive and photosensitive sensors, information-storage units, etc.

Abstract: Conceptus-derived paracrine signals play crucial roles in the preparation of a uterine environment capable of supporting implantation and development of the conceptus. However, little is known about the regulation of endometrial tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase (WARS) and manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) protein expression by the implanting and post-implanting conceptus. We hypothesized that the conceptus-derived signals favourably influences uterine environment for implantation through regulation of WARS and SOD2 expression in ovine caruncular endometrium. To test this hypothesis, WARS and SOD2 protein and mRNA expression was determined in caruncular endometrial tissues of unilaterally pregnant ewes at implantation (day 16) and post-implantation (day 20) periods. WARS protein expression increased in caruncular tissues of the gravid uterine horns compared with the non-gravid uterine horns on days 16 and 20 of pregnancy. There were no changes in SOD2 protein expression between the gravid and non-gravid uterine horns, irrespective of the day of pregnancy. On day 16 of pregnancy, there were no differences in WARS and SOD2 mRNA expression between the gravid and non-gravid uterine horns but expression of both genes was higher in the gravid uterine horns when compared with the non-gravid uterine horns on day 20 of pregnancy. In conclusion, the use of the unilaterally pregnant ewe model provides for the first time firm evidence that the early implantation and post-implanting conceptus-derived signals up-regulate WARS protein expression within the caruncular endometrium. Further studies are necessary to identify these signalling molecules and to understand mechanisms whereby they exert paracrine action within the endometrium.

Abstract: SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), in addition to their widespread utilization in consumer goods, are also being engineered for clinical use. They are considered to exert low toxicity both in vivo and in vitro, but the mechanisms involved in the cellular responses activated by these nanoobjects, even at non-toxic doses, have not been characterized in detail. This is of particular relevance for their interaction with the nervous system: silica NPs are good candidates for nanoneuromedicine applications. Here, by using two neuronal cell lines (GT1–7 and GN11 cells), derived from gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, we describe the mechanisms involved in the perturbation of calcium signaling, a key controller of neuronal function. At the non-toxic dose of 20μgmL−1, 50nm SiO2 NPs induce long lasting but reversible calcium signals, that in most cases show a complex oscillatory behavior. Using fluorescent NPs, we show that these signals do not depend on NPs internalization, are totally ascribable to calcium influx and are dependent in a complex way from size and surface charge. We provide evidence of the involvement of voltage-dependent and transient receptor potential-vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels.

Abstract: MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression. In this study, we demonstrated that retinoic acid (RA) treatment increases the expression of miR-512-3p. Overexpression of miR-512-3p inhibited cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines A549 and H1299. miR-512-3p inhibitor partially reversed these effects in H1299 cells stably expressing miR-512. We identified DOCK3, a RAC1-GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor), as a target gene of miR-512-3p. Overexpression of miR-512-3p led to the decrease of DOCK3 protein but not its mRNA. Knockdown of DOCK3 resulted in similar effects on adhesion, migration, and invasion as observed of miR-512-3p overexpression. Active RAC1 pull-down assay indicated that overexpression of miR-512-3p could decrease the activity of RAC1 with a higher efficiency than that of DOCK3 knockdown. Furthermore, expression of miR-512-3p was suppressed in most NSCLC patient tumor samples compared to its paired normal controls, suggesting that miR-512-3p might play a crucial role in lung cancer development. In conclusion, our results supported that miR-512-3p could inhibit tumor cell adhesion, migration, and invasion by regulating the RAC1 activity via DOCK3 in NSCLC A549 and H1299 cell lines.

Abstract: Few nm of Ag layer embedded in fluorine doped zinc tin oxide FZTO/Ag/FZTO was fabricated on glass by radio frequency magnetron sputtering at room temperature for the applications of organic photovoltaic׳s cells. The structural, electrical and optical properties of FZTO thin films were investigated. The multilayer of the FZTO (40nm)/Ag (9nm)/FZTO (40nm) electrode shows the maximum optical transmittance (λ=380–770nm) of 88.15%, quite low electrical resistivity of ~8×10−5Ω cm and the corresponding figure of merit (T10/Rsq) is equivalent to 3.46×10−2Ω−1. A normal organic photovoltaic׳s (OPV) structure of poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2 ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]-thiophenediyl] (PTB7): phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) was fabricated on glass/FZTO/Ag/FZTO to examine the compatibility of OPV as a transparent conducting electrode. The bulk hetero-junction organic photovoltaic׳s device fabricated on the multilayer FAF electrode exhibited open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.72V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 12.28mA/cm2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.54. These properties are analogous to Voc=0.75V, Jsc=14.87mA/cm2, FF=0.53 on commercial indium tin oxide (ITO). A resultant power conversion efficiency of 4.84% is comparable with the 5.90% of the same OPV structure on the commercial ITO as a reference. This reveals that FZTO/Ag/FZTO multilayer electrode is a promising electrode scheme for bulk hetero-junction organic photovoltaic׳s cells (BHJ-OPVs).

Abstract: Hypertension can increase mechanical stretch on the vessel wall, an important stimulus that induces collagen remodeling. Prolyl-4-hydroxylaseα1 (P4Hα1) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are essential for collagen synthesis and degradation. However, the effect of mechanical strain and collagen synthesis remains largely unknown. This study aimed to identify the effect of stretch on MMPs and P4Hα1 and the involved signaling pathways. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) were stimulated with mechanical stretch (0, 10% and 18% strain), and production of P4Hα1 as well as production and gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 was force-dependently increased. Mechanical stretch at 18% also increased the expression of type I and III collagen and the phosphorylation of Akt, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). MMP-2 production and activity enhanced by 18% stretch were inhibited by the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. Blockade of p38 MAPK or JNK inhibited the promoting effect of stretch on P4Hα1. The in vivo model of aortic banding showed increased protein levels of MMP-2, P4Hα1 and collagen I and III in the aorta. Thus, mechanical stretch increased MMP-2 and P4Hα1 expression in HASMCs via AKT-P38 MAPK-JNK signaling, thereby inducing vascular remodeling.

Abstract: The T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) is a plasma membrane-associated protein that is highly expressed in human acute myeloid leukaemia cells. As an acute myeloid leukaemia antigen, it could therefore be considered as a potential target for immune therapy and highly-specific drug delivery. However, a conceptual understanding of its biological role is required before consideration of this protein for therapeutic settings. Here, we reveal the detailed mechanism of action underlying the biological responses mediated by the Tim-3 receptor in myeloid cells. Our studies demonstrate that Tim-3 triggers growth factor type responses in acute myeloid leukaemia cells by activating a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. In addition, the receptor activates hypoxic signalling pathways upregulating glycolysis and pro-angiogenic responses. These findings suggest that Tim-3 could be used as a potential therapeutic target for immune therapy and drug delivery in human acute myeloid leukaemia cells.

Abstract: Historically, spectral analysis of internal quantum efficiency has played an important role in solar cell characterization. The applicability of this technique is reassessed in view of developments over recent years as a means of determining cell optical and electrical properties. The refined technique, applicable to both conventional and front surface field devices, highlights three distinct spectral regions, allowing additional front surface investigation by blue response analysis and more simplified analysis over a weakly absorbed region where photo-generation is uniform throughout the absorber and parasitic absorption remains sufficiently constant at these wavelengths. The approach is demonstrated by application to a modern front surface field device as a complement to previous work.

Abstract: The hot carrier cell aims to extract the electrical energy from photo-generated carriers before they thermalise to the band edges. Hence it can potentially achieve a high current and a high voltage and hence very high efficiencies up to 66% for unconcentrated sunlight and 85% under maximum concentration. To slow the rate of carrier thermalisation is very challenging, but modification of the phonon energies and the use of nanostructures are both promising ways to achieve some of the required slowing of carrier cooling. Required absorber material properties have been identified, relating to phononic and electronic properties as well as to practical considerations. Candidate materials evaluated in terms of these prerequisites include large mass anion, transition metal nitrides, Group IV compounds and nanostructures. Promising candidate materials include InN, HfN and SnSi. Initial measurements indicate slowed carrier cooling in III–Vs with large phonon band gaps in multiple quantum wells. It is expected that soon proof of concept of hot carrier devices will pave the way for their development to fully functioning high efficiency solar cells.

Abstract: The first demonstration of single contact electron beam induced current (SCEBIC) technique on multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells is reported. A lumped single-diode analytical model is also proposed to theoretically explain the SCEBIC phenomenon within solar cells as well as the current transient characteristics of the major model parameters, such as shunt resistance Rsh, junction capacitance Cj and parasitic capacitance Cs. The accuracy of the analytical model is then verified using PSPICE simulations, which show a close match with the experimental results. It is found that a large value of parasitic capacitance Cs is necessary to achieve good SCEBIC signal strength with a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and this is realized experimentally by adopting a metal enclosure in the measurement setup. In addition, an advantage of SCEBIC over the conventional double-contact method is also demonstrated by characterizing partially processed solar cells, which clearly illustrates the high degree of flexibility of SCEBIC in solar cell characterization.

Abstract: We present a method that can be used to quantify and optimize the performance of electrochromic polymers and evaluate how the choice of coating method affects the film characteristics. The mathematical approach, together with a standard experimental procedure to perform it, is described. This method can be applicable to any electrochromic material and deposition technique with the only requirement being that the Beer–Lambert law is followed. Three common (and industrially applicable) coating techniques (namely spray, blade and spin coating), together with three solution processable electrochromic polymers (ECP-Magenta, ECP-Black and ECP-Cyan), were used in the study to illustrate the feasibility of this method. For all the evaluated polymers, the choice of deposition method had a direct effect on the maximum achievable contrast. Spin coated films tended to show the highest contrasts, closely followed by blade coated films and finally spray coated films. When explaining those differences we showed that coloration efficiency, widely used as an electrochromic quality parameter, is not directly related to achievable contrast values. Instead, we have proposed the volumetric redox density. It has been found that higher values of this magnitude translate into higher achievable contrasts.

Abstract: The optical and luminescence properties of CaI2 and NaCl doped with divalent thulium are reported for solar energy applications. These halides strongly absorb solar light from the UV up to 900nm due to the intense Tm2+ 4f13→4f125d1 electronic transitions. Absorption is followed by emission of 1140nm light due to the 2F5/2→2F7/2 transition of the 4f13 configuration that can be efficiently converted to electric power by thin film CuInSe2 (CIS) solar cells. Because of a negligible spectral overlap between absorption and emission spectra, a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) based on these black luminescent materials would not suffer from self-absorption losses. The Tm2+ doped halides may therefore lead to efficient semi-transparent power generating windows that absorb solar light over the whole visible spectrum. It will be shown that the power efficiency of the Tm2+ based LSCs can be up to four times higher compared to LSCs based on organic dyes or quantum dots.

Abstract: Ternary chalcogenide semiconductor Cu2SnS3 (CTS) is an emerging material, attracting increasing interest for the applications in thin film solar cells. Here we report a pulsed laser deposition route to synthesize compact and single phase CTS thin films for the first time. The effects of the annealing temperature on the formation of CTS films were investigated. XRD and Raman studies revealed that the annealed CTS thin films have a polycrystalline nature with a cubic crystal structure, and the crystalline size of the CTS thin films increases as the annealing temperature increases. The direct optical band gap energy of the CTS thin film annealed at 400°C is found to be 1.01eV. Hall effect measurements indicate that the film has a p-type conductivity with a hole mobility of 0.51cm2/Vs. Finally, a thin film solar cell was fabricated with a SLG/Mo/CTS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO/Al structure. A photo-electric conversion efficiency of 0.82% was achieved with a short circuit current density of 11.90mA/cm2. We are successful in achieving the better values of VOC for the CTS solar cells. The route developed here may provide an alternative approach to produce CTS thin film solar cells.

Abstract: High quality epitaxial crystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) films were grown on n-type (100)—Germanium (Ge) substrates using pulsed electron deposition (PED) technique at a remarkably low substrate temperature of 300°C, thanks to the high-energy of adatoms arriving to the substrate. The crystalline quality was confirmed by X-ray diffraction techniques and from Transmission Electron Microscopy and the only defects found were twin boundaries along the (112) direction in these CIGS films; surprisingly neither misfit dislocations nor Kinkerdall voids were observed. A 100meV optical band located below the band edge was observed by Photoluminescence technique. Current–voltage and capacitance–voltage measurements confirm an intrinsic p-type conductivity of CIGS films, with a free carrier concentration of ≈3.5×1016cm−3. These characteristics of crystalline CIGS films are crucial for a variety of potential applications, such as more efficient absorber layers in single-junction and as an integral component of multi-junction thin-film solar cells.

Abstract: Recent evidence has indicated that miRNAs play important roles in carcinogenesis. The identification of dysregulated miRNAs and the target genes they regulate might enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A microarray analysis was performed to identify dysregulated miRNAs in NPC tissue samples, and protein-coding genes targeted by three or more downregulated miRNAs were selected using miRWalk and used in a pathway enrichment analysis. Nineteen KEGG pathways were selected by DAVID, including the MAPK, focal adhesion, gap junction, ECM–receptor interaction, TGF-beta, and p53 signalling pathways, most of which are involved in NPC carcinogenesis and progression. MiR-143 was significantly downregulated in NPC cell lines and clinical samples. The ectopic expression of miR-143 suppressed NPC cell viability, colony formation, and anchorage-independent growth in vitro, and it inhibited xenograft tumour growth in vivo. Furthermore, KRAS was confirmed as a direct target of miR-143, and silencing KRAS expression suppressed NPC cell viability and proliferation. The miR-143/KRAS pathway provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate the development and progression of NPC, and it provides novel therapeutic targets for NPC.

Abstract: Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is an important mechanism for Ca2+ influx in non-excitable cells, also present in excitable cells. The activation of store-operated channels (SOCs) is finely regulated by the filling state of the intracellular agonist-sensitive Ca2+ compartments, and both, the mechanism of sensing the Ca2+ stores and the nature and functional properties of the SOCs, have been a matter of intense investigation and debate. The identification of STIM1 as the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor and both Orai1, as the pore-forming subunit of the channels mediating the Ca2+-selective store-operated current, and the members of the TRPC subfamily of proteins, as the channels mediating the cation-permeable SOCs, has shed new light on the underlying events. This review summarizes the initial hypothesis and the current advances on the mechanism of activation of SOCE.

Abstract: A linear solar-tracking spectrum-splitting scheme for solar photovoltaics is investigated. The investigation is made by means of a numerical optimization and an analytical approach to predict conversion efficiency based on available experimental data. For a simple spectrum splitting scheme, a high conversion efficiency limit of 43% without and 48% with solar concentration is predicted for two single junction solar cells. It is also shown that efficiencies of at least 37% and 41% are to be expected if state of the art cells are used. The investigation was performed using a Fourier Modal Method electromagnetic solver based on the scattering matrix formalism combined with a numerical optimizer utilizing the Evolution Strategy.

Abstract: The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) has been described for the first time about four decades ago. Since then, numerous studies have shown that this modification occurs in response to a wide variety of stimuli on five evolutionarily conserved serine residues. However, despite a large body of information on the respective kinases and the signal transduction pathways, the physiological role of rpS6 phosphorylation remained obscure until genetic manipulations were applied in both yeast and mammals in an attempt to block this modification. Thus, studies based on both mice and cultured cells subjected to disruption of the genes encoding rpS6 and the respective kinases, as well as the substitution of the phosphorylatable serine residues in rpS6, have laid the ground for the elucidation of the multiple roles of this protein and its posttranslational modification. This review focuses primarily on newly identified kinases that phosphorylate rpS6, pathways that transduce various signals into rpS6 phosphorylation, and the recently established physiological functions of this modification. It should be noted, however, that despite the significant progress made in the last decade, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the diverse effects of rpS6 phosphorylation on cellular and organismal physiology are still poorly understood.

Abstract: A RF power profiling process has been developed to efficiently grow nanostructured silicon (nc-Si:H) p-layers for high-efficiency amorphous silicon solar cells. The p-layer deposition starts at a relatively low power in the initial stage, which is then continuously and rapidly increased to a high level until the bulk p-layer deposition is finished. Incorporating the p-layer into a-Si:H solar cell resulted in high Voc and high FF simultaneously, which can be ascribed to the reduced recombination at the i/p interface caused by the suitable band-gap of p-layer, low ion damage to i/p interface, and appropriate band-gap matching between p- and i-layers during the RF power profiling process. An initial efficiency of 10.8% for an a-Si:H solar cell with both high Voc of 0.99V and high FF of 0.72 was obtained. This power profiling scheme is potentially advantageous since it is easier to integrate into continuous process.

Abstract: A comprehensive outdoor study of polymer solar cells and modules for duration of one year was conducted. Different sample geometries and encapsulations were employed in order to study the spread in the lifetimes. The study is a complimentary report to previous work that focused on indoor ageing tests. Comparison of the indoor and outdoor lifetimes was performed by means of the o-diagram, which constitutes the initial steps towards establishing a method for predicting the lifetime of an organic photovoltaic device under real operational conditions based on a selection of accelerated indoor tests. Acceleration factors were determined using the ISOS-protocols, which enabled reproducible data acquisition between different laboratories and operators within the OPV community. A semi-automatic filtering method was employed for processing data acquired in outdoor tests. It was found that the lifetime of the samples tested under outdoor conditions was somewhere between the lifetimes of samples measured in accelerated indoor test conditions of damp heat and light soaking (ISOS-D-3 and ISOS-L-2) and in moderate indoor test conditions (shelf life and high temperature storage). The presented results reveal that while the accelerated ageing studies reveal days and weeks of lifetime for the studied samples, in outdoor real operational conditions the samples demonstrate stability up to months and seasons.

Abstract: A hybrid electrolyte for energy efficient windows was fabricated by incorporating functionalized zirconium oxide (ZrO2) nanocrystals into poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) and complexed with lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiCF3SO3). Ionic conductivity of the electrolyte increased by 4 orders of magnitude upon addition of a phase-pure cubic ZrO2 that was synthesized by reacting zirconium (IV) isopropoxide and benzyl alcohol at 210°C for 3 days. Functionalizing the nanocrystal with a vinyl group-containing ligand, at a ligand-to-ZrO2 molar ratio of 0.1:1, enhanced the electrolyte's optical transmittance doubly while maintaining its high ionic conductivity of 1.78×10−3Scm−1 at a loading of 3.85ZrO2wt%. Further addition of the ligand significantly decreased the ionic conductivity but kept a high optical transmittance. This new nanocomposite electrolyte with further tuning has the potential to be next generation electrolyte for energy efficient windows.

Abstract: A solution based approach to deposit a p-type CuI hole-transport layer that replaces PEDOT:PSS layer in the fabrication of high-efficiency poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) solar cells is reported here. X-ray diffraction analysis identifies the cubic γ-phase of CuI. A Kelvin probe measurement technique is utilized to identify the effective work function of CuI coated ITO. The device optimization is done by varying the concentration of CuI in the precursor solution which played an important role in the efficiency of the solar cell devices. In an effort to explore new inexpensive hole conducting materials for organic solar cells, we have identified copper iodide as a possible alternative. Moreover, the low temperatures required to process CuI films make it a perfect candidate to be used in organic solar cells on flexible substrates.

Abstract: Organometal trihalide perovskite solar cells have recently attracted lots of attention in the photovoltaic community due to their escalating efficiency and solution processability. The most efficient organometallic mixed-halide sensitized solar cells often employ 2,2′7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) as the hole-transporting material. In this work, we investigated the effect of different atmospheric storage conditions, particularly vacuum, dry nitrogen, and dry air, on the photovoltaic performance of TiO2–CH3NH3PbI3−xClx–spiro-MeOTAD solar cells. We found that spin coating of spiro-MeOTAD in an oxygen atmosphere alone was not adequate to functionalize its hole-transport property completely, and our systematic experiments revealed that the device efficiency depends on the ambient atmospheric conditions during the drying process of spiro-MeOTAD. Complementary incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE), light absorption and photoluminescence quenching measurements allowed us to attribute the atmosphere-dependent efficiency to the improved electronic characteristics of the solar cells. Furthermore, our Fourier transform infrared and electrical impedance measurements unambiguously detected modifications in the spiro-MeOTAD after the drying processes in different gas environments. Our findings demonstrate that proper oxidization and p-doping in functionalizing spiro-MeOTAD play a very critical role in determining device performance. These findings will facilitate the search for alternative hole-transporting materials in high-performance perovskite solar cells with long-term stability.

Abstract: In this work, a selective solar absorber made of nanostructured titanium gratings deposited on an ultrathin MgF2 spacer and a tungsten ground film is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Normal absorptance of the fabricated solar absorber is characterized to be higher than 0.9 in the UV, visible and, near infrared (IR) regime, while the mid-IR emittance is around 0.2. The high broadband absorption in the solar spectrum is realized by the excitation of surface plasmon and magnetic polariton resonances, while the low mid-IR emittance is due to the highly reflective nature of the metallic components. Further directional and polarized reflectance measurements show wide-angle and polarization-insensitive high absorption within solar spectrum. Temperature-dependent spectroscopic characterization indicates that the optical properties barely change at elevated temperatures up to 350°C. The solar-to-heat conversion efficiency with the fabricated metamaterial solar absorber is predicted to be 78% at 100°C without optical concentration or 80% at 400°C with 25 suns. The performance could be further improved with better fabrication processes and geometric optimization during metamaterial design. The strong spectral selectivity, favorable diffuse-like behavior, and good thermal stability make the metamaterial selective absorber promising for significantly enhancing solar thermal energy harvesting in various systems at mid to high temperatures.

Abstract: The induction of inner ear hair cells from stem cells or progenitor cells in the inner ear proceeds through a committed inner ear sensory progenitor cell stage prior to hair cell differentiation. To increase the efficacy of inducing inner ear hair cell differentiation from the stem cells or progenitor cells, it is essential to identify comprehensive markers for the stem cells/progenitor cells from the inner ear, the committed inner ear sensory progenitor cells and the differentiating hair cells to optimize induction conditions. Here, we report that we efficiently isolated and expanded the stem cells or progenitor cells from postnatal mouse cochleae, and induced the generation of inner ear progenitor cells and subsequent differentiation of hair cells. We profiled the gene expression of the stem cells or progenitor cells, the inner ear progenitor cells, and hair cells using aRNA microarray analysis. The pathway and gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed. Analysis of genes exclusively detected in one particular cellular population revealed 30, 38, and 31 genes specific for inner ear stem cells, inner ear progenitor cells, and hair cells, respectively. We further examined the expression of these genes in vivo and determined that Gdf10+Ccdc121, Tmprss9+Orm1, and Chrna9+Espnl are marker genes specific for inner ear stem cells, inner ear progenitor cells, and differentiating hair cells, respectively. The identification of these marker genes will likely help the effort to increase the efficacy of hair cell induction from the stem cells or progenitor cells.

Polo-like kinase 3 (PLK3) mediates the clearance of the accumulated PrP mutants transiently expressed in cultured cells and pathogenic PrPSc in prion infected cell line via protein interaction,

Abstract: Polo-like kinases (PLKs) family has long been known to be critical for cell cycle and recent studies have pointed to new dimensions of PLKs function in the nervous system. Our previous study has verified that the levels of PLK3 in the brain are severely downregulated in prion-related diseases. However, the associations of PLKs with prion protein remain unclear. In the present study, we confirmed that PrP protein constitutively interacts with PLK3 as determined by both in vitro and in vivo assays. Both the kinase domain and polo-box domain of PLK3 were proved to bind PrP proteins expressed in mammalian cell lines. Overexpression of PLK3 did not affect the level of wild-type PrP, but significantly decreased the levels of the mutated PrPs in cultured cells. The kinase domain appeared to be responsible for the clearance of abnormally aggregated PrPs, but this function seemed to be independent of its kinase activity. RNA-mediated knockdown of PLK3 obviously aggravated the accumulation of cytosolic PrPs. Moreover, PLK3 overexpression in a scrapie infected cell line caused notable reduce of PrPSc level in a dose-dependent manner, but had minimal effect on the expression of PrPC in its normal partner cell line. Our findings here confirmed the molecular interaction between PLK3 and PrP and outlined the regulatory activity of PLK3 on the degradation of abnormal PrPs, even its pathogenic isoform PrPSc. We, therefore, assume that the recovery of PLK3 in the early stage of prion infection may be helpful to prevent the toxic accumulation of PrPSc in the brain tissues.

Abstract: Nanog plays an important role in maintaining the pluripotency of murine and human embryonic stem cells. However, the molecular features and transcriptional regulation of the NANOG gene have not been well investigated in pig. Here, we report, for the first time, that porcine NANOG is encoded by a single exon gene (SEG) mapped on chromosome 1 and has two daughter genes, one pseudogene NANOGP1 on chromosome 5 and one tandem duplicate on chromosome 1. The duplicated pseudogene NANOGP2 has high sequence similarity to NANOG, but does not encode a functional protein due to deletions and in-frame stop codons. The NANOGP1 contains four exons and three introns, but is short of the homeodomain sequence. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that NANOG mRNA in porcine iPS cells is transcribed from the SEG NANOG, but not from NANOGP1, because the NANOGP1 promoter is highly methylated, as confirmed by global DNA methylation analysis. The NANOG protein encoded by NANOG retains N, H, and C1/W/C2 domains. The H domain is required for nuclear translocation, while the C1/W/C2 domain ensures the NANOG regulatory function. Overexpression of NANOG in porcine embryonic fibroblasts promoted upregulation of its target genes SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC. In conclusion, the functional porcine NANOG that is different in chromosomal structure from mouse and human genes is a single exon gene and encodes the functional NANOG protein that can be specifically regulated by OCT4/SOX2, and can promote the activation of target pluripotent factors in vivo.

Abstract: In this work, we present the incorporation of a laser doped selective emitter into the i-PERC platform at Imec using large area magnetically confined boron-doped Czochralski grown silicon wafers. Cells were fabricated with self-aligned plated n-type contacts with a comparison between the use of a homogenous emitter with contact openings formed by picosecond laser ablation and a selective emitter formed by laser doping with a mode-locked UV laser using various processing speeds. Without modification to other processes in the i-PERC platform, improvements in efficiency of approximately 0.4% absolute were obtained with the inclusion of the selective emitter structure through improvements in open circuit voltage, fill factor and reduced series resistance. This resulted in peak efficiencies of 20.5% using a processing speed for laser doping of 5m/s.

Abstract: A unique feature in mammalian erythropoiesis is the dramatic chromatin condensation followed by enucleation. This step-by-step process starts at the beginning of terminal erythropoiesis after the hematopoietic stem cells are committed to erythroid lineage. Although this phenomenon is known for decades, the mechanisms of chromatin condensation and enucleation remain elusive. Recent advances in cell and molecular biology have started to reveal the molecular pathways in the regulation of chromatin condensation, the establishment of nuclear polarity prior enucleation, and the rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton in enucleation. However, many challenging questions, especially whether and how the apoptotic mechanisms are involved in chromatin condensation and how to dissect the functions of many actin cytoskeleton proteins in cytokinesis and enucleation, remain to be answered. Here I review our current understanding of mammalian erythroid chromatin condensation and enucleation during terminal differentiation with a focus on more recent studies. I conclude with my perspective of future works in this rising topic in developmental and cell biology.

Abstract: The potential cause of blindness worldwide includes diseases of the cornea, ocular surface (limbal stem cell deficiency, allergic conjunctivitis, dry eye diseases), and retinal diseases. The presence of stem cells (limbal stem cells) in the basal region of the limbus makes it an important tool for the ocular regeneration and also in maintaining the transparency of eye by replacing the corneal epithelium continuously. Various surgical modalities have been developed like cultured limbal epithelial transplantation, cultured oral mucosal epithelial transplantation, simple limbal epithelial transplantation, etc., utilizing the cell-based regenerative properties to treat limbal disorder. Cell-based therapies for ocular repair and regeneration comprise a major hope by therapies involving the mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and limbal stem cells for the restoration of vision in individuals whose ocular tissue has been irreversibly damaged by disease or trauma. This review explores critical needs in human disease mainly the ocular problem where cell-based therapeutics is exceptionally well suited and also the use of animal models, various artificial scaffolds, as well as advancement in clinical technique to challenge the current demand to overcome corneal blindness.

Abstract: In this work, a series of stain steel 15×15cm2 CuInS2 solar cells with efficiencies close to the record one for this kind of devices, are analyzed. Through a careful and comprehensive study of the structural and electronic properties of the CuInS2 layer, we show that in a general fashion the strain originated by the thermal annealing affects the energy band splitting and reduces the short circuit current. Then, through an innovative combination of photoreflectance and Raman scattering analysis, we demonstrate that the presence of CuAu domains in the bulk layer of a CuInS2 is directly related with this strain reduction contributing to the improvement of short circuit current. We propose that the presence Cu–Au phase domains reduce the strain within the CuInS2 layer, and improve the quality of the CIS chalcopyrite crystals, leading to reduced carrier recombination while increasing carriers mobility. As a consequence we conclude that the presence of said domains improves the short circuit current in the studied devices.

Abstract: Wnt5a is involved in the activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling, including planar cell polarity (PCP) and Wnt-Ca2+ pathways. The Ror-family of receptor tyrosine kinases is composed of Ror1 and Ror2 in mammals. Ror2 acts as a receptor or coreceptor for Wnt5a and regulates Wnt5a-induced activation of PCP pathway, and Wnt5a–Ror2 axis indeed plays critical roles in the developmental morphogenesis by regulating cell polarity and migration. Furthermore, Wnt5a–Ror2 axis is constitutively activated in cancer cells and confers highly motile and invasive properties on cancer cells through the expression of matrix metalloproteinase genes and enhanced formation of invadopodia. Meanwhile, Wnt5a also exhibits a tumor-suppressive function in certain cancers, including breast and colorectal carcinomas. Thus, it is of great importance to understand the respective molecular mechanisms governing Wnt5a-mediated tumor-progressive and tumor-suppressive functions, in order to develop novel and proper diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting Wnt5a signaling for human cancers.

Abstract: Past two years have seen the rapid emergence of a new class of solar cell based on mixed organic–inorganic halide perovskites. The optical and optical frequency dielectric properties of these perovskites at ambient temperatures are important both to the design of optimised solar cells and in other areas such as the refinement of electronic band structure calculations. Limited previous information has been published. The experimental optical and related dielectric constants of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films are reported at 297K as determined by detailed analysis of reflectance and transmittance data. Absorption coefficients are also extracted from these data and compared with a range of previously reported values.

Abstract: Trichomonas vaginalis expresses multiple proteinases, mainly of the cysteine type (CPs). A cathepsin L-like 34kDa CP, designated TvCP4, is synthesized as a 305-amino-acid precursor protein. TvCP4 contains the prepro fragment and the catalytic triad that is typical of the papain-like CP family of clan CA. The aim of this work was to determine the function of the recombinant TvCP4 prepro region (ppTvCP4r) as a specific inhibitor of CPs. We cloned, expressed, and purified the recombinant TvCP4 prepro region. The conformation of the purified and refolded ppTvCP4r polypeptide was verified by circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorescence emission spectra. The inhibitory effect of ppTvCP4r was tested on protease-resistant extracts from T. vaginalis using fluorogenic substrates for cathepsin L and legumain CPs. In 1-D zymograms, the inhibitory effect of ppTvCP4r on trichomonad CP proteolytic activity was observed in the ∼97, 65, 39, and 30kDa regions. By using 2-D zymograms and mass spectrometry, several of the CPs inhibited by ppTvCP4r were identified. A clear reduction in the proteolytic activity of several cathepsin L-like protein spots (TvCP2, TvCP4, TvCP4-like, and TvCP39) was observed compared with the control zymogram. Moreover, pretreatment of live parasites with ppTvCP4r inhibited trichomonal haemolysis in a concentration dependent manner. These results confirm that the recombinant ppTvCP4 is a specific inhibitor of the proteolytic activity of cathepsin L-like T. vaginalis CPs that is useful for inhibiting virulence properties depending on clan CA papain-like CPs.

Abstract: In this study, light-management approaches for amorphous silicon oxide (a-SiOx:H) thin film solar cells were developed. First, to enhance back reflection in the device, an Al-doped ZnO (AZO) film was introduced at the back interface between n-type nanocrystalline silicon oxide (n-nc-SiOx:H) and Ag. In addition, we successfully suppressed optical losses at front interfaces by employing anti-reflection layers of MgF2 at air/Asahi-VU and TiO2 at Asahi-VU/p-layer interfaces. These light-managing techniques contributed to the enhancing of the short circuit current density (Jsc) from 9.88 to 11.42mA/cm2, resulting in an increase in efficiency from 7.35% to 8.15%. We next replaced AZO/p-nc-SiOx:H conventional buffer layers inserted at the TiO2/p-layer interface by developing a hydrogen-reduced p+ buffer layer to remove the AZO protection layer. The new TiO2/buffer structure was found to be beneficial for attaining a good fill factor (0.738) and open circuit voltage (1.013V) by avoiding hydrogen plasma damages; this, improved the efficiency of the a-SiOx:H solar cell up to 8.40% when using a very thin absorber of only 100nm.

Abstract: Color design for large-area hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) semi-transparent glass-to-glass (GTG) photovoltaic (PV) modules has been studied for the application to building integrated PV (BIPV) modules. Three-dimensional color space of CIE (Commission Internationale de l'éclairage) L*a*b* (CIELAB) is adopted for a systematic color analysis. Three kinds of design configurations are invented by combining the transparency of back contacts and laser patterning techniques. In addition, the realization of emotionally stable and esthetic color is challenged using color back encapsulating materials. Transparent back contact (TBC)-type modules with green color are fabricated via the most simplified processes without sacrificing any active area. Bright and esthetic hybrid-type modules are also fabricated using additional laser-scribed patterns and blue encapsulating film. It is found that opaque back contact (OBC)-type module design is the best way to achieve target color together with the highest conversion efficiency. Because color of the back encapsulating materials does not deteriorate the conversion efficiency, the developed design concepts are promising options for large-area semi-transparent BIPV modules.

Abstract: Insufficient and/or improper protein degradation is associated with the development of various human pathologies. Enzymatic therapy with proteolytic enzymes aimed to improve insufficient proteolytic activity was suggested as a treatment of protease deficiency-induced disorders. Since in many cases human degradome is incapable of degrading the entire target protein(s), other organisms can be used as a source of proteases exhibiting activities distinct from human enzymes, and plants are perspective candidates for this source. In this study recombinant wheat cysteine protease Triticain-α was shown to refold in vitro into an autocatalytically activated proteolytic enzyme possessing glutenase and collagenase activities at acidic (or close to neutral) pH levels at the temperature of human body. Mass-spectrometry analysis of the products of Triticain-α-catalyzed gluten hydrolysis revealed multiple cleavage sites within the sequences of gliadin toxic peptides, in particular, in the major toxic 33-mer α-gliadin-derived peptide initiating inflammatory responses to gluten in celiac disease (CD) patients. Triticain-α was found to be relatively stable in the conditions simulating stomach environment. We conclude that Triticain-α can be exploited as a basic compound for development of (i) pharmaceuticals for oral administration aimed at release of the active enzyme into the gastric lumen for CD treatment, and (ii) topically active pharmaceuticals for wound debridement applications.

Abstract: This paper reports the chemical and optical characterization of a cost effective down-converter polymeric film based on an Eu(III) complex embedded in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) which placed on conventional photovoltaic (PV) glass, used for module assembly, produces an increase in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a reference Si-based solar cell. Our results show that the best location of the down-converter is on the front surface of the glass. The UV absorption of the down-converter protects and enhances the stability of the PMMA film. This increase in EQE is further enlarged by placing a light trap on the device, collecting most of the down-converted photons, which are isotropically emitted. Additional increases in EQE are expected after a proper encapsulation of the solar cell and the glass. Thermogravimetric measurements show that the down-converter active specie is stable up to 275°C and the PMMA film is stable up to 225°C, consequently, it can be applied in any step of the lamination process in the production of PV modules. Thereby, the down-converter can be profitably applied in Si-based solar cells and modules, particularly in concentrated PV systems.

Abstract: A stearic acid (SA)/graphene composite microcapsule, having a core–shell structure, is prepared for the first time using a latex technology for use as a novel composite phase change material (PCM) for thermal energy management. Melted SA is dispersed in water using an anionic surfactant as a stabilizer and cooled to prepare a water-based latex containing negatively charged SA particles. A simple mixing of this latex with an aqueous dispersion of graphene, prepared with aid of a cationic surfactant, results in the self-assembly of graphene on a SA particle surface by an electrostatic interaction, allowing for the encapsulation of SA with graphene to form a core–shell composite microcapsule. The protective graphene shell gives an excellent shape stability to the composite during phase change and a substantial improvement in thermal stability of the active SA core. In addition, the core–shell structure contains a high weight fraction of the active core material due to the ultra-thin graphene shell having high thermal conductivity. This results in a high performance PCM with a large latent heat and an improved thermal conductivity.

Abstract: LAT1 (SLC7A5) and CD98 (SLC3A2) constitute a heterodimeric transmembrane protein complex that catalyzes amino acid transport. Whether one or both subunits are competent for transport is still unclear. The present work aims to solve this question using different experimental strategies. Firstly, LAT1 and CD98 were immuno-detected in protein extracts from SiHa cells. Under oxidizing conditions, i.e., without addition of SH (thiol) reducing agent DTE, both proteins were revealed as a 120kDa major band. Upon DTE treatment separated bands, corresponding to LAT1(35kDa) or CD98(80kDa), were detected. LAT1 function was evaluated in intact cells as BCH sensitive [3H]His transport inhibited by hydrophobic amino acids. Antiport of [3H]His was measured in proteoliposomes reconstituted with SiHa cell extract in presence of internal His. Transport was increased by DTE. Hydrophobic amino acids were best inhibitors in addition to hydrophilic Tyr, Gln, Asn and Lys. Cys, Tyr and Gln, included in the intraliposomal space, were transported in antiport with external [3H]His. Similar experiments were performed in proteoliposomes reconstituted with the recombinant purified hLAT1. Results overlapping those obtained with native protein were achieved. Lower transport of [3H]Leu and [3H]Gln with respect to [3H]His was detected. Kinetic asymmetry was found with external Km for His lower than internal one. No transport was detected in proteoliposomes reconstituted with recombinant hCD98. The experimental data demonstrate that LAT1 is the sole transport competent subunit of the heterodimer. This conclusion has important outcome for following studies on functional characterization and identification of specific inhibitors with potential application in human therapy.

Abstract: Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common form of primary intraocular malignancy in adult and has the tendency to metastasize. BAP1 mutations are frequently found in UM and are associated with a poor prognosis. The role of BAP1 in cell cycle regulation is currently a research highlight, but its underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we report that BAP1 knockdown can lead to G1 arrest and is accompanied by a decrease in the expression of S phase genes in OCM1 cells. Furthermore, in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, BAP1 could bind to E2F1 responsive promoters and the localization of BAP1 to E2F1-responsive promoters is host cell factor-1 dependent. Moreover, BAP1 knockdown leads to increased H2AK119ub1 levels on E2F responsive promoters. Together, these results provide new insight into the mechanisms of BAP1 in cell cycle regulation.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal localization of signals is a fundamental feature impacting cell survival and proper function. The cell needs to respond in an accurate manner in both space and time to both intra- and intercellular environment cues. The regulation of this comprehensive process involves the cytoskeleton and the trafficking machinery, as well as local protein synthesis and ligand–receptor mechanisms. Alterations in such mechanisms can lead to cell dysfunction and disease. Motor neurons that can extend over tens of centimeters are a classic example for the importance of such events. Changes in spatiotemporal localization mechanisms are thought to play a role in motor neuron degeneration that occurs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this review we will discuss these mechanisms and argue that possible misregulated factors can lead to motor neuron degeneration in ALS.

Abstract: The anionic doping of a titania catalyst system results in extension of its effective absorption spectrum due to formation of localized impurity states above valence band edge. Also hydrogenation based disorder-engineering induces band tailing which provides a red-shift in absorption spectrum and creates more number of Ti3+ which has a stabilization effect on the nitrogen induced impurity states. Further, the mixed phase titania consistently shows improved activity as it reduces the recombination of charge carriers very effectively as well due to band-offset at phase junction. We synthesize a hydrogenation based disorder-engineered and nitrogen doped mixed phase titania (H–N–TiO2(M)) photocatalyst system with an aim to have a superior photocatalysts with all the attributes which have never been demonstrated earlier in a single system to have complementary effect on its performance. In this work commercial catalyst Degussa P25 (DP25) is used as a reference catalyst for the activity comparison. The characterization results show the existence of the intended attributes in the photocatalyst and kinetic study results reveal that the H–N–TiO2(M) system has 19 times higher activity compared to reference system under visible light.

Abstract: Three distinct low bandgap copolymers are synthesized by the combination of N-(2′-propylpentanoyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) and (fluorinated) 2,3-bis[5′-(2”-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2′-yl]quinoxaline (Qx) and these PDTPQx derivatives are investigated as electron donor materials in bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. Due to the DTP N-acylation and the introduction of the Qx units, both the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the short-circuit current density (Jsc) increase compared to previous devices based on DTP-type donor polymers. Organic solar cells with an average Voc of 0.67V, a Jsc of 12.57mA/cm² and a fill factor of 0.54 are obtained, affording a power conversion efficiency of 4.53% (4.81% for the top-performing device), a record value for (N-acyl-)DTP-based polymer solar cells devoid of special interlayer materials. Despite further enhancement of the Voc, the solar cell efficiency declines for the fluorinated PDTPQx copolymers because of the inability to achieve a finely intermixed bulk heterojunction blend nanomorphology.

Abstract: Implementing antireflection (AR) coatings in micromorph tandem solar cells is a challenging process in which not only more sunlight should get conducted into the cells, but also the current matching between subcells should either be maintained or get improved. In this work, the novel double-layered AR coatings were prepared on either one side or two sides of glass superstrates using hybridized hollow silica nanosphere (HSN) sols. As a result of improvement in light distribution via double-layered AR coatings, the current difference between the top and bottom subcells was decreased to be 0.05mA/cm2, much smaller than that of untreated cells, 0.33mA/cm2. Furthermore, the cells grown on the two-sided AR coated superstrates demonstrated the largest increases in current densities of top and bottom subcells, 4.20% and 7.53%, respectively, which were much higher than those of the cells on one-sided AR coated superstrates. The underlying origin was ascribed to the better light trapping induced by multiscale texturing at front boron-doped zinc oxide (BZO) electrodes, which resulted from the conformal growth of BZO on HSNs with unique surface morphologies. The findings provided a practical way to simultaneously realize light distribution and trapping using the two-sided AR coated glass superstrates without any amendment of layers inside micromorph tandem solar cells.

Abstract: Podoplanin is a small mucin-like transmembrane protein expressed in several adult tissues and with an important role during embryogenesis. It is needed for the proper development of kidneys and lungs as well as accurate formation of the lymphatic vascular system. In addition, it is involved in the physiology of the immune system. A wide variety of tumors express podoplanin, both in the malignant cells and in the stroma. Although there are exceptions, the presence of podoplanin results in poor prognosis. The main consequence of forced podoplanin expression in established and tumor-derived cell lines is an increase in cell migration and, eventually, the triggering of an epithelial–mesenchymal transition, whereby cells acquire a fibroblastoid phenotype and increased motility. We will examine the current status of the role of podoplanin in the induction of epithelial–mesenchymal transition as well as the different interactions that lead to this program.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were once considered to be deleterious agents, contributing to a vast range of pathologies. But, now their protective effects are being appreciated. Both their damaging and beneficial effects are initiated when they target distinct molecules and consequently begin functioning as part of complex signal-transduction pathways. The recognition of ROS as signaling mediators has driven a wealth of research into their roles in both normal and pathophysiological states. The present review assesses the relevant recent literature to outline the current perspectives on redox-signaling mechanisms, physiological implications, and therapeutic strategies. This study highlights that a more fundamental knowledge about many aspects of redox signaling will allow better targeting of ROS, which would in turn improve prophylactic and pharmacotherapy for redox-associated diseases.

Abstract: In this study, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate high performance of antireflection (AR) coating composed of the ZnO nanorods (NRs) and TiO2 layers applied on InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells. The high performance of this AR coating is due to the realization of a smooth gradient profile of refractive index fabricated by only two physical layers. First, due to the inherent inhomogeneous-nanoporous geometry along the surface normal, the ZnO NRs are reasonable to be considered as discrete multiple optical layers with low scattering loss, leading to the index smoothly increasing from air ambient toward down to the solar cells. Second, to compensate the gap of index between ZnO and solar cells, an additional TiO2 layer with index in between is hence necessary to insert under ZnO NRs, significantly further reducing the Fresnel reflection loss of the entire device. The ZnO NRs/ TiO2 layer shows a low wavelength-averaged (solar spectrum weighted) reflectance of 6.00% (4.78%) over a wide spectral range of λ=380–1800nm, and exhibits a hydrophobic surface with a water contact angle of 128.2°. At device level, we compared the photovoltaic performance of solar cells with and without AR coating, the short-circuit density (JSC) is enhanced by 31.8% and 23.8% for solar cells integrated with the ZnO NRs/TiO2 layer and conventional SiO2/TiO2 double-layer AR (DLAR) coating, respectively. Under a very large incident angle of solar illumination (θ=80°), the ZnO NRs/TiO2 layer remains static with JSC enhancement of 35.2%, whereas the JSC enhancement of conventional DLAR coating drops down to 9.4%. In addition, the ZnO NRs/TiO2 layer barely affects the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the solar device. Therefore, the proposed ZnO NRs/TiO2 layer with a smoother graded refractive index change is highly promising for the AR coating applications for the next-generation solar cells.

Abstract: The conventional quantitative evaluation of dark lock-in thermography (DLIT), electroluminescence (EL), and photoluminescence (PL) images of solar cells is based on the model of independent diodes, where each image pixel is assumed to be connected with the terminals by an independent series resistance. In reality, however, the solar cell represents a 2-dimensional resistance-diode network. In this work solar cells containing well-defined spatial distributions of the saturation current density J01 and also containing J02-type and ohmic shunts are modeled for various externally applied biases and illumination conditions realistically as a 2-dimensional resistance-diode network. The resulting local diode voltage distributions are converted into DLIT, EL and PL images, which are further processed by conventional evaluation methods, which rely on the simple model of independent diodes. These are the so-called “Local-IV” method for the DLIT analysis, which may be supported by EL results to obtain series resistance images, and “C-DCR” for the PL analysis. This leads to calculated images of the local effective series resistance Rs and of J01. Regarding the resulting Rs images, PL shows the expected series resistance distribution and is not affected by the shunt regions. The DLIT–EL Rs images instead yield expected values only in the homogeneous regions, which are not affected by the assumed shunts. DLIT–EL determines higher values of Rs in local shunt regions and lower values around these regions and in spatially extended shunt regions. Regarding the J01 images both methods again give the expected results if J01 is distributed homogeneously. However, in the shunted regions, PL suffers from balancing currents within the emitter and DLIT from optical blurring. By comparing local and extended regions of increased J01 we find that DLIT approximates the expected J01 value better than PL, which clearly underestimates even extended local maxima of J01. For a local current analysis of silicon solar cells we recommend the use of DLIT for the determination of J01 images and PL for the determination of Rs images.
