Abstract: Summary
Previous studies have shown that eukaryotic elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2) serves as an essential heart-specific translation elongation element and that its mutation or knockout delays heart development and causes congenital heart disease and death among species. However, the function and regulatory mechanisms of eEF1A2 in mammalian heart development remain largely unknown. Here we identified the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Cpmer (cytoplasmic mesoderm regulator), which interacted with eEF1A2 to co-regulate differentiation of mouse and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, Cpmer specifically recognized Eomes mRNA by RNA-RNA pairing and facilitated binding of eEF1A2 with Eomes mRNA, guaranteeing Eomes mRNA translation and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Our data reveal a novel functionally conserved lncRNA that can specifically regulate Eomes translation and cardiomyocyte differentiation, which broadens our understanding of the mechanism of lncRNA involvement in the subtle translational regulation of eEF1A2 during mammalian heart development.

Abstract: The Keap1 protein is the master modulator of Nrf2 pathway; moreover, it is the hub of such important processes as cancer, cell stress, inflammation, and chemio- and radio-resistance. That is why Keap1 has become an intriguing pharmacological target. Many recent data show that Keap1 interacts with HSP90 protein. In this study, we use ferulic acid (FA) as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, able to relieve inflammatory response. It is known that treatment with 100 μg of FA can significantly decrease the oxidative stress, so it turns to be useful to study the antioxidant regulation. The RAW 264.7 cells transfected with si-Keap1 and LPS treated are the in vitro model used to study the effects of Keap1 silencing on HSP90 activities and the FA antioxidant modulation. Immunoblot data and qPCR analysis show that Keap1 is involved in HSP90 modulation and on anti-oxidative response. Keap1 silencing affects negatively COX2 activation; in fact western blot and qPCR analysis conducted on RAW 264.7 cells Keap1silenced highlight that LPS treatment does not induce COX2 activation. In addition, the FA anti-oxidative and modulatory effect is abolished in COX2 pathway. The same results are point out using human A549 cell line with an allelic mutation on Keap1 gene, and the protein results are partially inactive. This preliminary study points out that Keap1protein is involved in HSP90 and anti-oxidative pathway regulation.

Abstract: A20 is involved in inflammation and bone metabolism in periodontitis. Regulation of macrophage polarization may be an effective target for periodontitis treatment, and A20 has a regulatory role in macrophage polarization. This study aimed to explore the effects of A20 on macrophage polarization in periodontitis and the underlying mechanism. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) targeting A20 was exploited to achieve A20 knockdown or overexpression in periodontal tissues of mice with experimental periodontitis. The (AAV-A20-RNAi) +P group showed increased alveolar bone resorption when compared with PBS + P and CON305 + P groups. However, the degree of bone destruction was reduced in the (AAV-A20) +P group relative to PBS + P and CON299 + P groups. A20 knockdown resulted in enhanced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and decreased CD206 expression in mice periodontal tissues. In addition, higher levels of M1 macrophage polarization markers (iNOS, CD86, TNF-α) and lower CD206 expression were found in THP-1 cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) (Pg. LPS) and interferon‐γ (IFN-γ) when A20 was silenced. A20 overexpression showed opposite effects on macrophage polarization in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of A20 was correlated with upregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in mice periodontal tissues or THP-1 cells. On the contrary, A20 overexpression inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. MCC950 suppressed M1 macrophage polarization aggravated through A20 knockdown in Pg. LPS and IFN-γ stimulated cells. Our data suggested that A20 inhibits periodontal bone resorption and NLRP3-mediated M1 macrophage polarization; A20 is expected to be a novel target for the treatment of periodontitis.

Abstract: Hypoxia is an important cause of cervical lymph nodes metastasis and recurrence of thyroid cancer, but its specific mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we constructed a hypoxia model of thyroid cancer cells and explored the potential targets of hypoxia response through sequencing. The function and mechanism of the target protein were investigated in an in vitro cell model. We found that fibroblast growth factor 11 (FGF11), a member of the FGFs family, was upregulated in hypoxic thyroid cancer cells and thyroid cancer tissues. The knockdown of FGF11 blocked the promotion of hypoxia on the proliferation, migration and invasion of tumor cells. Importantly, FGF11 enhanced the stability of HIF1α through inhibiting its degradation in TPC-1 cells. under hypoxic condition, FGF11 formed a positive feedback loop with HIF1α to promote the growth and metastasis of thyroid cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Neural precursor cell (NPC) dysfunction has been consistently implicated in autism. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NPCs from two autism groups (three idiopathic [I-ASD] and two 16p11.2 deletion [16pDel]) were used to investigate if proliferation is commonly disrupted. All five individuals display defects, with all three macrocephalic individuals (two 16pDel, one I-ASD) exhibiting hyperproliferation and the other two I-ASD subjects displaying hypoproliferation. NPCs were challenged with bFGF, and all hyperproliferative NPCs displayed blunted responses, while responses were increased in hypoproliferative cells. mRNA expression studies suggest that different pathways can result in similar proliferation phenotypes. Since 16pDel deletes MAPK3, P-ERK was measured. P-ERK is decreased in hyperproliferative but increased in hypoproliferative NPCs. While these P-ERK changes are not responsible for the phenotypes, P-ERK and bFGF response are inversely correlated with the defects. Finally, we analyzed iPSCs and discovered that 16pDel displays hyperproliferation, while idiopathic iPSCs were normal. These data suggest that NPC proliferation defects are common in ASD.

Abstract: Summary
A complete understanding of synaptic-vesicle recycling requires the use of multiple microscopy methods to obtain complementary information. However, many currently available probes are limited to a specific microscopy modality, which necessitates the use of multiple probes and labeling paradigms. Given the complexity of vesicle populations and recycling pathways, having new single-vesicle probes that could be used for multiple microscopy techniques would complement existing sets of tools for studying vesicle function. Here, we present a probe based on the membrane-binding C2 domain of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) that fulfills this need. By conjugating the C2 domain with different detectable tags, we demonstrate that a single, modular probe can allow synaptic vesicles to be imaged at multiple levels of spatial and temporal resolution. Moreover, as a general endocytic marker, the C2 domain may also be used to study membrane recycling in many cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Gut microbial diurnal oscillations are important diet-dependent drivers of host circadian rhythms and metabolism ensuring optimal energy balance. However, the interplay between diet, microbes, and host factors sustaining intestinal oscillations is complex and poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model, we report the host C-type lectin antimicrobial peptide Reg3γ works with key ileal microbes to orchestrate these interactions in a bidirectional manner and does not correlate with the intestinal core circadian clock. High-fat diet is the primary driver of microbial oscillators that impair host metabolic homeostasis, resulting in arrhythmic host Reg3γ expression that secondarily drives abundance and oscillation of key gut microbes. This illustrates transkingdom coordination of biological rhythms primarily influenced by diet and reciprocal sensor-effector signals between host and microbial components, ultimately driving metabolism. Restoring the gut microbiota’s capacity to sense dietary signals mediated by specific host factors such as Reg3γ could be harnessed to improve metabolic dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Abundance and diversity of bacteria and their viral predators, bacteriophages (phages), in the digestive tract are associated with human health. Particularly intriguing is the long-term coexistence of these two antagonistic populations. We performed genome-wide RNA sequencing on a human enteroaggregative Escherichia coli isolate to identify genes differentially expressed between in vitro conditions and in murine intestines. We experimentally demonstrated that four of these differentially expressed genes modified the interactions between E. coli and three virulent phages by either increasing or decreasing its susceptibility/resistance pattern and also by interfering with biofilm formation. Therefore, the regulation of bacterial genes expression during the colonization of the digestive tract influences the coexistence of phages and bacteria, highlighting the intricacy of tripartite relationships between phages, bacteria, and the animal host in intestinal homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Iron accumulation in microglia has been observed in Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders and is thought to contribute to disease progression through various mechanisms, including neuroinflammation. To study this interaction, we treated human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iPSC-MG) with iron, in combination with inflammatory stimuli such as interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and amyloid β. Both IFN-γ and iron treatment increased labile iron levels, but only iron treatment led to a consistent increase of ferritin levels, reflecting long-term iron storage. Therefore, in iPSC-MG, ferritin appeared to be regulated by iron revels rather than inflammation. Further investigation showed that while IFN-γ induced pro-inflammatory activation, iron treatment dampened both classic pro- and anti-inflammatory activation on a transcriptomic level. Notably, iron-loaded microglia showed strong upregulation of cellular stress response pathways, the NRF2 pathway, and other oxidative stress pathways. Functionally, iPSC-MG exhibited altered phagocytosis and impaired mitochondrial metabolism following iron treatment. Collectively, these data suggest that in MG, in contrast to current hypotheses, iron treatment does not result in pro-inflammatory activation, but rather dampens it and induces oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of gene expression via protein translation is critical for growth, development, and stress response. While puromycin-based techniques have been used to quantify protein translation in C. elegans, they have been limited to using lysate from whole worms. To achieve tissue-specific quantification of ribosome activity in intact C. elegans, we report the application of O-propargyl-puromycin in a cuticle defective mutant followed by conjugation of an azide fluorophore for detection using fluorescent confocal microscopy. We apply this technique to quantify translation in response to heat shock, cycloheximide, or knockdown of translation factors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that O-propargyl-puromycin can be used to quantify translation between tissues or within a tissue like the germline. This technique is expected to have a broad range of applications in determining how protein translation is altered in different tissues in response to stress or gene knockdowns or with age.

Abstract: Summary
We introduce Metis, a new plugin for the Perseus software aimed at analyzing quantitative multi-omics data based on metabolic pathways. Data from different omics types are connected through reactions of a genome-scale metabolic-pathway reconstruction. Metabolite concentrations connect through the reactants, while transcript, protein, and protein post-translational modification (PTM) data are associated through the enzymes catalyzing the reactions. Supported experimental designs include static comparative studies and time-series data. As an example for the latter, we combine circadian mouse liver multi-omics data and study the contribution of cycles of phosphoproteome and metabolome to enzyme activity regulation. Our analysis resulted in 52 pairs of cycling phosphosites and metabolites connected through a reaction. The time lags between phosphorylation and metabolite peak show non-uniform behavior, indicating a major contribution of phosphorylation in the modulation of enzymatic activity.

Abstract: Summary
Large-scale genomic studies have identified within-host adaptation as a hallmark of bacterial infections. However, the impact of physiological, metabolic, and immunological differences between distinct niches on the pathoadaptation of opportunistic pathogens remains elusive. Here, we profile the within-host adaptation and evolutionary trajectories of 976 isolates representing 119 lineages of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) sampled longitudinally from both the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts of 123 patients with urinary tract infections. We show that lineages persisting in both niches within a patient exhibit increased allelic diversity. Habitat-specific selection results in niche-specific adaptive mutations and genes, putatively mediating fitness in either environment. Within-lineage inter-habitat genomic plasticity mediated by mobile genetic elements (MGEs) provides the opportunistic pathogen with a mechanism to adapt to the physiological conditions of either habitat, and reduced MGE richness is associated with recurrence in gut-adapted UPEC lineages. Collectively, our results establish niche-specific adaptation as a driver of UPEC within-host evolution.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of colorectal cancer (CRC) progression is critical for developing innovative treatment strategies. As an endoplasmic reticulum-located protein, B cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BCAP31) has been identified to be highly expressed in multiple cancers. However, its function and molecular mechanism in CRC remain not fully understood. In the present study, BCAP31 expression and its correlation with the clinical stage were analyzed based on TCGA database. We demonstrated that loss of BCAP31 suppressed CRC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Emerin was an interaction partner and downstream molecule of BCAP31. Knockdown of BCAP31 promoted the nuclear envelope localization of Emerin, leading to a reduction of β-catenin accumulation in the nucleus, which resulted in downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin downstream target genes, including c-Myc, cyclin D1, Survivin, and Mcl-1. Moreover, downregulation of Emerin partially restored the BCAP31 depletion-mediated β-catenin protein level and tumor suppressive effects in CRC cells.Our data highlights the pivotal role of BCAP31 depletion in inhibiting cell proliferation in CRC cells, and mechanistically via Emerin/β-catenin signaling, which may serve as a promising target for CRC treatment.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. Here, the purpose of the study was to explore the function of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) in PD and its underlying mechanism. An in vivo 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-hydrochloride (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD was generated and the SH-SY5Y cells were treated with MPP + to induce neuronal damage in vitro. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) and Western blot were used to detect the expression of HOTAIR, miR-221-3p, α-synuclein and apoptosis-related genes. MTT, flow cytometry and TUNEL assay was used to detect cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. The levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α,IL-1β and IL-6 were detected by ELISA assay. The levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined using the appropriate assay kits. The interactions between miR-221-3p and HOTAIR or α-synuclein were determined by dual luciferase assay and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP). Co-localization of HOTAIR and miR-221-3p was also proved by immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that HOTAIR was highly expressed, while miR-221-3p expression was decreased in PD model in vivo and in vitro. In SH-SY5Y cells treated with MPP+, the knockdown of HOTAIR increased cell viability and reduced cell apoptosis, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress reaction, while HOTAIR overexpression led to opposite effects. Furthermore, HOTAIR sponged miR-221-3p which directly targeted α-synuclein and thus regulated the expression of α-synuclein. Meanwhile, inhibiting miR-221-3p could partially reverse the neuroprotective effects of HOTAIR knockdown. In conclusion, HOTAIR attenuated the injury of SH-SY5Y cells induced by MPP+ via miR-221-3p/α-synuclein axis, suggesting the potential therapeutic value of HOTAIR in PD.

Abstract: The pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) belongs to the nuclear receptor family and functions as a xenobiotic and endobiotic sensor by binding to various molecules through its relatively flexible ligand-binding domain. In addition to these well-known canonical roles, we previously reported that PXR represses osteoblast differentiation. However, the mechanisms underlying the PXR-mediated repression of osteoblast differentiation remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed the changes in global gene expression profiles induced by PXR in calvarial osteoblasts cultured in standard fetal bovine serum (in which PXR induces repression of differentiation), and in those cultured in charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (in which PXR does not induce repression of differentiation). The comparison revealed that PXR attenuated the Hedgehog-mediated signaling in culture conditions that induced PXR-mediated repression of differentiation. Real-time PCR analysis showed that PXR repressed the Hedgehog signaling-induced genes such as Gli1 and Hhip, and conversely induced the Hedgehog signaling-repressed genes such as Cdon, Boc, and Gas1. Activation of Smo-mediated signaling in osteoblasts following treatment with a Smo agonist (SAG) significantly restored Gli-mediated transcriptional activity and osteoblast differentiation. Our results demonstrate the osteoblast-autonomous effects of PXR and identify a novel regulation of Hedgehog signaling by nuclear receptors.

Abstract: ZIC2 is involved in the tumor progression of many types of cancers. The role of ZIC2 in the metastasis of colorectal cancer and its mechanism are not yet clear. In this study, we found that high ZIC2 expression was not only associated with poor prognosis, relapse-free survival and advanced metastasis but was also an independent prognostic factor in colorectal cancer patients. Moreover, ZIC2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while the upregulation of ZIC2 had the opposite effect in vitro. ZIC2 overexpression induced TGF-β1 expression and increased Smad3 phosphorylation. The carcinogenic effects of elevated ZIC2 expression can be eliminated by interfering with the TGF-β1 receptor with inhibitors. This further verified the promoting effect of ZIC2 on the TGF-β signaling pathway. In vivo experiments have also confirmed that ZIC2 can promote liver metastases of colorectal cancer. The results suggest that ZIC2 is associated with poor prognosis and relapse-free survival in colorectal cancer patients. Moreover, ZIC2 promoted colorectal cancer progression and metastasis by activating the TGF-β signaling pathway. Hence, ZIC2 is expected to be a new therapeutic and prognostic target for colorectal cancer in the future.

Herein, we characterize the humoral response in 27 naive and 40 recovered vaccinees. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and memory B cell (MBC) responses are durable up to 6 months, although antibody half-lives are shorter for naive recipients. The magnitude of the humoral responses to vaccination strongly correlates with responses to initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neutralization titers are lower against SARS-CoV-2 variants in both recovered and naive vaccinees, with titers more reduced in naive recipients. While the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the main neutralizing target of circulating antibodies, Moderna-vaccinated naives show a lesser reliance on RBDs, with >25% neutralization remaining after depletion of RBD-binding antibodies. Overall, we observe that vaccination induces higher peak titers and improves durability in recovered compared with naive vaccinees. These findings have broad implications for current vaccine strategies deployed against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a common malignant tumor worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit a regulatory role in the progression of ESCC. Our research was performed to investigate the potential molecular mechanism of lncRNA GATA2-AS1 in ESCC. Methods: The expression of GATA2-AS1 was identified by qRT–PCR. Cell function assays explored the potential effect of GATA2-AS1 on ESCC progression. The subcellular hierarchical localization method was executed to identify the subcellular localization of GATA2-AS1 in ESCC cells. A prediction website was utilized to discover the relationships among GATA2-AS1, miR-940 and PTPN12. Dual luciferase reporter gene, pull-down assays and RIP assays were executed to verify the binding activity among GATA2-AS1, miR-940 and PTPN12. Xenograft tumor experiments were performed to evaluate ESCC cell growth in vivo. Results: The expression of GATA2-AS1 and PTPN12 was reduced, while miR-940 expression was enhanced in ESCC tissues and cell lines. In vivo experiments showed that GATA2-AS1 inhibited the progression of ESCC cells toward malignancy. Bioinformatics analysis, dual luciferase and RIP assays revealed that GATA2-AS1 upregulated PTPN12 expression by competitively targeting miR-940. miR-940 reversed the inhibitory effect of GATA2-AS1 on the biological behavior of ESCC cells. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that GATA2-AS1, expressed at low levels in ESCC, plays a crucial role in the progression of ESCC by targeting the miR-940/PTPN12 axis and could be a potential drug target to treat ESCC patients.

Abstract: Summary
Two doses of Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine elicit robust severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-neutralizing antibodies with frequent adverse events. Here, by applying a high-dimensional immune profiling on 92 vaccinees, we identify six vaccine-induced immune dynamics that correlate with the amounts of neutralizing antibodies, the severity of adverse events, or both. The early dynamics of natural killer (NK)/monocyte subsets (CD16+ NK cells, CD56high NK cells, and non-classical monocytes), dendritic cell (DC) subsets (DC3s and CD11c− Axl+ Siglec-6+ [AS]-DCs), and NKT-like cells are revealed as the distinct cell correlates for neutralizing-antibody titers, severity of adverse events, and both, respectively. The cell correlates for neutralizing antibodies or adverse events are consistently associated with elevation of interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-inducible chemokines, but the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CXCR3 are expressed in distinct manners between the two correlates: vaccine-induced expression on the neutralizing-antibody correlate and constitutive expression on the adverse-event correlate. The finding may guide vaccine strategies that balance immunogenicity and reactogenicity.

Abstract: Summary
Temporal dynamics of the gut microbiota potentially limit the identification of microbial features associated with health status. Here, we used whole-genome metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the intra- and inter-individual variations of gut microbiota composition and functional potential of a disease-free Swedish population (n = 75) over one year. We found that 23% of the total compositional variance was explained by intra-individual variation. The degree of intra-individual compositional variability was negatively associated with the abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (a butyrate producer) and two Bifidobacterium species. By contrast, the abundance of facultative anaerobes and aerotolerant bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus varied extensively, independent of compositional stability. The contribution of intra-individual variance to the total variance was greater for functional pathways than for microbial species. Thus, reliable quantification of microbial features requires repeated samples to address the issue of intra-individual variations of the gut microbiota.

Abstract: Summary
Disease recovery dynamics are often difficult to assess, as patients display heterogeneous recovery courses. To model recovery dynamics, exemplified by severe COVID-19, we apply a computational scheme on longitudinally sampled blood transcriptomes, generating recovery states, which we then link to cellular and molecular mechanisms, presenting a framework for studying the kinetics of recovery compared with non-recovery over time and long-term effects of the disease. Specifically, a decrease in mature neutrophils is the strongest cellular effect during recovery, with direct implications on disease outcome. Furthermore, we present strong indications for global regulatory changes in gene programs, decoupled from cell compositional changes, including an early rise in T cell activation and differentiation, resulting in immune rebalancing between interferon and NF-κB activity and restoration of cell homeostasis. Overall, we present a clinically relevant computational framework for modeling disease recovery, paving the way for future studies of the recovery dynamics in other diseases and tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Sleep deficiency, a common public health problem, causes ocular discomfort and affects ocular surface health. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we identified that short-term sleep deprivation (SD) resulted in hyperproliferation of corneal epithelial progenitor cells (CEPCs) in mice. The expression levels of p63 and Keratin 14, the biomarkers of CEPCs, were upregulated in the corneal epithelium after short-term SD. In addition, SD led to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and subsequent decrease in antioxidant capacity, in the tear film. Exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) could directly stimulate the proliferation of CEPCs in vivo and in vitro. Topical treatment of antioxidant L-glutathione preserved the over-proliferation of CEPCs and attenuated corneal epithelial defects in SD mice. Moreover, the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway is essential to ROS-stimulated cell proliferation in CEPCs. However, long-term SD ultimately led to early manifestation of limbal stem cell deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
We develop a deep learning approach, in silico immunohistochemistry (IHC), which takes routinely collected histochemical-stained samples as input and computationally generates virtual IHC slide images. We apply in silico IHC to Alzheimer's disease samples, where several hallmark changes are conventionally identified using IHC staining across many regions of the brain. In silico IHC computationally identifies neurofibrillary tangles, β-amyloid plaques, and neuritic plaques at a high spatial resolution directly from the histochemical images, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of between 0.88 and 0.92. In silico IHC learns to identify subtle cellular morphologies associated with these lesions and can generate in silico IHC slides that capture key features of the actual IHC.

Abstract: Summary
DDX41 is a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in human myeloid neoplasms, but whether it affects hematopoiesis is unknown. Using a knockout mouse, we demonstrate that DDX41 is required for mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) survival and differentiation, particularly of myeloid lineage cells. Transplantation of Ddx41 knockout fetal liver and adult bone marrow (BM) cells was unable to rescue mice from lethal irradiation, and knockout stem cells were also defective in colony formation assays. RNA-seq analysis of Lin−/cKit+/Sca1+ Ddx41 knockout cells from fetal liver demonstrated that the expression of many genes associated with hematopoietic differentiation were altered. Furthermore, differential splicing of genes involved in key biological processes was observed. Our data reveal a critical role for DDX41 in HSPC differentiation and myeloid progenitor development, likely through regulating gene expression programs and splicing.

Abstract: Summary
The impacts of individual commensal microbes on immunity and disease can differ dramatically depending on the surrounding microbial context; however, the specific bacterial combinations that dictate divergent immunological outcomes remain largely undefined. Here, we characterize an immunostimulatory Allobaculum species from an inflammatory bowel disease patient that exacerbates colitis in gnotobiotic mice. Allobaculum inversely associates with the taxonomically divergent immunostimulatory species Akkermansia muciniphila in human-microbiota-associated mice and human cohorts. Co-colonization with A. muciniphila ameliorates Allobaculum-induced intestinal epithelial cell activation and colitis in mice, whereas Allobaculum blunts the A.muciniphila-specific systemic antibody response and reprograms the immunological milieu in mesenteric lymph nodes by blocking A.muciniphila-induced dendritic cell activation and T cell expansion. These studies thus identify a pairwise reciprocal interaction between human gut bacteria that dictates divergent immunological outcomes. Furthermore, they establish a generalizable framework to define the contextual cues contributing to the “incomplete penetrance” of microbial impacts on human disease.

Abstract: Summary
The insulin receptor (INSR) is an evolutionarily conserved signaling protein that regulates development and cellular metabolism. INSR signaling promotes neurogenesis in Drosophila; however, a specific role for the INSR in maintaining adult neural stem cells (NSCs) in mammals has not been investigated. We show that conditionally deleting the Insr gene in adult mouse NSCs reduces subventricular zone NSCs by ∼70% accompanied by a corresponding increase in progenitors. Insr deletion also produced hyposmia caused by aberrant olfactory bulb neurogenesis. Interestingly, hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent behaviors were unperturbed. Highly aggressive proneural and mesenchymal glioblastomas had high INSR/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway gene expression, and isolated glioma stem cells had an aberrantly high ratio of INSR:IGF type 1 receptor. Moreover, INSR knockdown inhibited GBM tumorsphere growth. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the INSR is essential for a subset of normal NSCs, as well as for brain tumor stem cell self-renewal.

Abstract: Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are a common terminal pathway for many types of cancer, especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the phenotype and differentiation status of MPE-infiltrating CD8+ T cells have not yet been systematically addressed. In this study, the surface molecules and cytokine secretion of T cells in MPE and peripheral blood (PB) were analyzed using flow cytometry. We found an increased frequency of CD8+ T cells in MPE compared to PB among lung cancer patients, of which the effector memory subset (Tem, CCR7- CD45RA−) and central memory subset (Tcm, CCR7+ CD45RA−) were upregulated. MPE-derived Tem and Tcm subsets expressed more PD1 or CD39, and there was a greater population of cells in these subsets that co-expressed them. In addition, Tem and Tcm cells from MPE had higher cytokine production than terminally differentiated effector memory cells (TemRA, CCR7- CD45RA+) and naïve cells (Tnaive, CCR7+CD45RA+). Our results demonstrate that the Tem and Tcm cells in MPE may have advantages in both tumor reactivity and immune functionality. Altogether, these findings help to characterize the phenotype of MPE-derived CD8+ T cells in terms of differentiation and tumor reactivity and reveal their potential as a target for immunotherapy.

Abstract: Cancer cells acquire immunoediting ability to evade immune surveillance and thus escape eradication. It is widely known that mutant proteins encoded from tumor suppressor TP53 exhibit gain-of-function in cancer cells, thereby promoting progression; however, how mutant p53 contributes to the sheltering of cancer cells from host anticancer immunity remains unclear. Herein, we report that murine p53 missense mutation G242A (corresponding to human G245A) suppresses the activation of host natural killer (NK) cells, thereby enabling breast cancer cells to avoid immune assault. We found that serial injection of EMT6 breast cancer cells that carry wild-type (wt) Trp53, like normal fibroblasts, promoted NK activity in mice, while SVTneg2 cells carrying Trp53 G242A+/+ mutation decreased NK cell numbers and increased CD8+ T lymphocyte numbers in spleen. Innate immunity based on NK cells and CD8 T cells was reduced in p53 mutant-carrying transgenic mice (Trp53 R172H/+, corresponding to human R175H/+). Further, upon co-culture with isolated NK cells, EMT6 cells substantively activated NK cells and proliferation thereof, increasing interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production; however, SVTneg2 cells suppressed NK cell activation. Further mechanistic study elucidated that p53 can modulate expression by cancer cells of Mult-1 and H60a, which are activating and inhibitory ligands for NKG2D receptors of NK cells, respectively, to enhance immune surveillance against cancer. Our findings demonstrate that wt p53 is requisite for NK cell-based immune recognition and elimination of cancerous cells, and perhaps more importantly, that p53 missense mutant presence in cancer cells impairs NK cell-attributable responses, thus veiling cancerous cells from host immunity and enabling cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific CD4+ T cells are likely important in immunity against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), but our understanding of CD4+ longitudinal dynamics following infection and of specific features that correlate with the maintenance of neutralizing antibodies remains limited. Here, we characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells in a longitudinal cohort of 109 COVID-19 outpatients enrolled during acute infection. The quality of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ response shifts from cells producing interferon gamma (IFNγ) to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) from 5 days to 4 months post-enrollment, with IFNγ-IL-21-TNF-α+ CD4+ T cells the predominant population detected at later time points. Greater percentages of IFNγ-IL-21-TNF-α+ CD4+ T cells on day 28 correlate with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies measured 7 months post-infection (⍴ = 0.4, p = 0.01). mRNA vaccination following SARS-CoV-2 infection boosts both IFNγ- and TNF-α-producing, spike-protein-specific CD4+ T cells. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific, TNF-α-producing CD4+ T cells may play an important role in antibody maintenance following COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic disease in the brain is difficult to control and predicts poor prognosis. Here, we analyze human brain metastases and demonstrate their robust infiltration by CD8+ T cell subsets with distinct antigen specificities, phenotypic states, and spatial localization within the tumor microenvironment. Brain metastases are densely infiltrated by T cells; the majority of infiltrating CD8+ T cells express PD-1. Single-cell RNA sequencing shows significant clonal overlap between proliferating and exhausted CD8+ T cells, but these subsets have minimal clonal overlap with circulating and other tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, including bystander CD8+ T cells specific for microbial antigens. Using spatial transcriptomics and spatial T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, we show these clonally unrelated, phenotypically distinct CD8+ T cell populations occupy discrete niches within the brain metastasis tumor microenvironment. Together, our work identifies signaling pathways within CD8+ T cells and in their surrounding environment that may be targeted for immunotherapy of brain metastases.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived pancreatic progenitors (PPs) can be differentiated into beta-like cells in vitro and in vivo and therefore have therapeutic potential for type 1 diabetes (T1D) treatment. However, the purity of PPs varies across different hPSC lines, differentiation protocols, and laboratories. The uncommitted cells may give rise to non-pancreatic endodermal, mesodermal, or ectodermal derivatives in vivo, hampering the safety of hPSC-derived PPs for clinical applications and their differentiation efficiency in research settings. Recently, proteomics and transcriptomics analyses identified glycoprotein 2 (GP2) as a PP-specific cell surface marker. The GP2-enriched PPs generate higher percentages of beta-like cells in vitro, but their potential in vivo remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the GP2-enriched-PPs give rise to all pancreatic cells in vivo, including functional beta-like cells. Remarkably, GP2 enrichment eliminates the risk of teratomas, which establishes GP2 sorting as an effective method for PP purification and safe pancreatic differentiation.

Abstract: Mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remain closely tethered by contact sites to maintain unhindered biosynthetic, metabolic, and signalling functions. Apart from its constituent proteins, contact sites localize ER-unfolded protein response (UPR) sensors like Ire1 and PERK, indicating the importance of ER-mitochondria communication during stress. In the mitochondrial sub-compartment-specific proteotoxic model of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that an intact ER-UPR pathway is important in stress tolerance of mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) proteotoxic stress, while disrupting the pathway is beneficial during matrix stress. Deletion of IRE1 and HAC1 leads to accumulation of misfolding-prone proteins in mitochondrial IMS indicating the importance of intact ER-UPR pathway in enduring mitochondrial IMS proteotoxic stresses. Although localized proteotoxic stress within mitochondrial IMS does not induce ER-UPR, its artificial activation helps cells to better withstand the IMS proteotoxicity. Furthermore, overexpression of individual components of ER-mitochondria contact sites is found to be beneficial for general mitochondrial proteotoxic stress, in an Ire1-Hac1-independent manner.

Abstract: Cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), which is accompanied by a rapid decline in renal function and a high risk of death, is a complex critical illness with no effective or specific treatment. Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2), a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in the progression of multiple diseases, including cancers, cardiac fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy, etc. Here, by integrating two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets of cisplatin-induced AKI animal models, we identified PLK2 as a significantly up-regulated gene in AKI renal tissues, which was then verified in different AKI animal models and cell models. Suppressing PLK2 using siRNAs or inhibitors could enhance cisplatin-induced AKI by inducing severe apoptosis and oxidative stress damage, while enforced PLK2 expression could prevent renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin. We further discovered that PLK2 might phosphorylate glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in the pathogenesis of AKI. In conclusion, our results show that PLK2 play a protective role in cisplatin-induced AKI and may be a new protective target of cisplatin nephrotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Humanized mouse models and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus are increasingly used to study COVID-19 pathogenesis, so it is important to learn where the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is expressed. Here we mapped ACE2 expression during mouse postnatal development and in adulthood. Pericytes in the CNS, heart, and pancreas express ACE2 strongly, as do perineurial and adrenal fibroblasts, whereas endothelial cells do not at any location analyzed. In a number of other organs, pericytes do not express ACE2, including in the lung where ACE2 instead is expressed in bronchial epithelium and alveolar type II cells. The onset of ACE2 expression is organ specific: in bronchial epithelium already at birth, in brain pericytes before, and in heart pericytes after postnatal day 10.5. Establishing the vascular localization of ACE2 expression is central to correctly interpret data from modeling COVID-19 in the mouse and may shed light on the cause of vascular COVID-19 complications.

Abstract: The human endometrium is a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclic changes in response to sex steroid hormones to provide a receptive status for embryo implantation. Disruptions in this behavior may lead to implantation failure and infertility; therefore, it is essential to develop an appropriate in vitro model to study endometrial changes in response to sex hormones. In this regard, the first choice would be human endometrial cells isolated from biopsies that could be used as monolayer cell sheets or to generate endometrial organoids. However, the need for fresh samples and short-time viability of harvested endometrial biopsy limits these approaches. In order to overcome these limitations, we sought to develop an efficient, simple, robust and reproducible method to cryopreserve human endometrial biopsies that could be stored and/or shipped frozen and later thawed to generate endometrial organoids and endometrial stromal cells (EnSCs). These cryopreserved biopsies could be thawed and used to generate simple endometrial organoids or organoids for co-culture with matched stromal cells that are functionally responsive to sex hormones as similar as the organoids generated from fresh biopsy. An optimal endometrial tissue cryopreservation method would allow the possibility for endometrial tissue biobanking to enable future organoid generation from both healthy tissues and pathological conditions, and open new venues for generate endometrial assembloids, consisting of epithelial organoids and primary stromal cells.

Abstract: CTP synthase (CTPS) catalyzes the final step of de novo synthesis of the nucleotide CTP. In 2010, CTPS has been found to form filamentous structures termed cytoophidia in Drosophila follicle cells and germline cells. Subsequently, cytoophidia have been reported in many species across three domains of life: bacteria, eukaryotes and archaea. Forming cytoophidia appears to be a highly conserved and ancient property of CTPS. To our surprise, here we find that polar cells and stalk cells, two specialized types of cells composing Drosophila interfollicular stalks, do not possess obvious cytoophidia. We show that Myc level is low in these two types of cells. Treatment with a glutamine analog, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), increases cytoophidium assembly in main follicle cells, but not in polar cells or stalk cells. Moreover, overexpressing Myc induces cytoophidium formation in stalk cells. When CTPS is overexpressed, cytoophidia can be observed both in stalk cells and polar cells. Our findings provide an interesting paradigm for the in vivo study of cytoophidium assembly and disassembly among different populations of follicle cells.

Abstract: Anlotinib have shown certain therapeutic effects of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but drug resistance during treatment leads to the fact that the therapeutic effect is unsatisfactory. Herein, we investigated the tumor immune microenvironment about resistance mechanisms when application of Anlotinib and further improved its therapeutic effect. Our results showed that Anlotinib suppressed cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in RCC cells. Meanwhile, the significantly up-regulated expression of PD-L1 was observed in Anlotinib-treated RCC cells by the concentration and time-dependent manner. Further study showed that Anlotinib-induced PD-L1 expression was regulated by autocrine IL-6 mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways. Interestingly, Anlotinib combined with PD-L1 blockade increased the infiltration of IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, also decreased the quantity of Treg cells and MDSCs in vivo. Likewise, the therapy above showed significantly synergistic therapeutic effect as demonstrated by reduced tumor volume and weight. These results indicated that the drug resistance might be attributed to the Anlotinib induced-PD-L1 mediated immunosuppression in renal cancer treatment. Anlotinib combined anti-PDL-1 treatment exerts the potential anti-tumor effect by promoting the induction and activation of immune killer cells. The therapeutic strategy of Anlotinib combined anti-PDL-1 could be a potential and promising approach for the therapy of renal cancer or other malignant tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages are dynamic immune cells that can adopt several activation states. Fundamental to these functional activation states is the regulation of cellular metabolic processes. Especially in mice, metabolic alterations underlying pro-inflammatory or homeostatic phenotypes have been assessed using various techniques. However, researchers new to the field may encounter ambiguity in choosing which combination of techniques is best suited to profile immunometabolism. To address this need, we have developed a toolbox to assess cellular metabolism in a semi-high-throughput 96-well-plate-based format. Application of the toolbox to activated mouse and human macrophages enables fast metabolic pre-screening and robust measurement of extracellular fluxes, mitochondrial mass and membrane potential, and glucose and lipid uptake. Moreover, we propose an application of SCENITH technology for ex vivo metabolic profiling. We validate established activation-induced metabolic rewiring in mouse macrophages and report new insights into human macrophage metabolism. By thoroughly discussing each technique, we hope to guide readers with practical workflows for investigating immunometabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Phospholipids are ligands for nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) that regulate transcriptional programs relevant to normal physiology and disease. Here, we demonstrate that mimicking phospholipid-NR interactions is a robust strategy to improve agonists of liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), a therapeutic target for colitis. Conventional LRH-1 modulators only partially occupy the binding pocket, leaving vacant a region important for phospholipid binding and allostery. Therefore, we constructed a set of molecules with elements of natural phospholipids appended to a synthetic LRH-1 agonist. We show that the phospholipid-mimicking groups interact with the targeted residues in crystal structures and improve binding affinity, LRH-1 transcriptional activity, and conformational changes at a key allosteric site. The best phospholipid mimetic markedly improves colonic histopathology and disease-related weight loss in a murine T cell transfer model of colitis. This evidence of in vivo efficacy for an LRH-1 modulator in colitis represents a leap forward in agonist development.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in the study of neurological conditions have been possible because of pluripotent stem cell technologies and organoids. Studies have described the generation of neural ectoderm-derived retinal and brain structures from pluripotent stem cells. However, the field is still troubled by technical challenges, including high culture costs and variability. Here, we describe a simple and economical protocol that reproducibly gives rise to the neural retina and cortical brain regions from confluent cultures of stem cells. The spontaneously generated cortical organoids are transcriptionally comparable with organoids generated by other methods. Furthermore, these organoids showed spontaneous functional network activity and proteomic analysis confirmed organoids maturity. The generation of retinal and brain organoids in close proximity enabled their mutual isolation. Suspension culture of this complex organoid system demonstrated the formation of nerve-like structures connecting retinal and brain organoids, which might facilitate the investigation of neurological diseases of the eye and brain.

Abstract: Gastric cancer is a type of serious malignant tumors all around the world. TCGA data showed that the expression of TRIM65 (E3 ubiquitin ligase) was enhanced in the gastric cancer tissues. The role of TRIM65 in the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer remains unclear. In this study, we successfully established TRIM65-knockdown gastric cancer cells. Next, CCK-8, colony formation assays and transwell assays were performed to detect the cell proliferation and invasion. The results showed that suppression of TRIM65 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Interestingly, the Western blot assay confirmed that downregulation of TRIM65 increased the level of PPM1A and decreased the level of p-TBK1 in gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, immunoprecipitation assay revealed that knockdown of TRIM65 inhibited the ubiquitin degradation of PPM1A. In rescue experiments, suppression of PPM1A promoted the proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells transfected with sh-TRIM65. Therefore, our results suggested that knockdown of TRIM65 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells by suppressing the ubiquitin degradation of PPM1A and phosphorylation of TBK1.

Abstract: Many studies indicated that static magnetic fields (SMFs) have anti-cancer effects. However, effect of SMFs on cancer cells with strength exceeding 12 T are rarely reported. The intracellular iron could participate in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and affect cell proliferation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of 12 T high static magnetic field (HiSMF) on osteosarcoma cells and the relationship with intracellular iron. The 12 T HiSMF was generated by a superconducting magnet. The proliferation was evaluated by CCK-8 assays and cell counting. The apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, and ROS were evaluated by flow cytometry. Intracellular iron status was evaluated by atomic absorption spectroscopy and Calcein-AM/2,2′-bipyridyl. The expression of cell cycle and iron metabolism-related genes were analyzed by Western Blot. The result showed that 12 T HiSMF exposure suppressed the proliferation of osteosarcoma cell lines MNNG/HOS, U-2 OS, and MG63 via cell cycle arrest in S and G2/M. Meanwhile, 12 T HiSMF increasing intracellular ROS, and its antitumor effect was reduced by antioxidant. Furthermore, the intracellular total and free iron levels, the expression of FTH1 and DMT1 were increased by 12 HiSMF. The iron chelator (DFO) could reduce the cytotoxicity of 12 T HiSMF on osteosarcoma cells. Moreover, 12 T HiSMF could enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and sorafenib in osteosarcoma cells. In Conclusion, 12 T HiSMF could suppress osteosarcoma cells proliferation via intracellular iron and ROS related cell cycle arrest, and have application potential in osteosarcoma therapy combined with sorafenib and cisplatin.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle possesses remarkable adaptability to mechanical loading and regenerative potential following muscle injury primarily due to satellite cell activity. Although the roles of several types of interstitial cells in skeletal muscle have been documented, the signaling interplay between the skeletal muscle and the adjacent tendon tissue has not been elucidated. Here, we tested whether human tendon derived cells (tenocytes) could induce human myogenic cells (myoblasts) proliferation and differentiation in vitro using co-culture experiments that allowed us to investigate the effect of tenocytes secretion upon myogenic progression. This was done in vitro by introducing insert wells with either myoblasts, tenocytes, or no cells (control) into a myoblast containing well (co-culture). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a higher fusion index (≥5 nuclei within one Desmin + myotube) and a higher myotube diameter in co-cultures with tenocytes compared to myoblasts condition. Correspondingly, MHC-IIX gene expression was up-regulated when co-cultured with tenocytes. However, the proliferation of myoblasts (either Ki67 or BrdU + cells) was not enhanced under the presence of tenocytes. These findings show that tenocytes influence myotube formation upon human primary cells in vitro and contribute to understanding the role of tendon derived cells in skeletal muscle during development and regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
From genetic and etiological studies, autoimmune mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are suspected; however, the details remain unclear. In this study, we describe autoantibodies against neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM1) in patients with schizophrenia (5.4%, cell-based assay; 6.7%, ELISA) in a Japanese cohort (n = 223). Anti-NCAM1 autoantibody disrupts both NCAM1-NCAM1 and NCAM1-glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) interactions. Furthermore, the anti-NCAM1 antibody purified from patients with schizophrenia interrupts NCAM1-Fyn interaction and inhibits phosphorylation of FAK, MEK1, and ERK1 when introduced into the cerebrospinal fluid of mice and also reduces the number of spines and synapses in frontal cortex. In addition, it induces schizophrenia-related behavior in mice, including deficient pre-pulse inhibition and cognitive impairment. In conclusion, anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in patients with schizophrenia cause schizophrenia-related behavior and changes in synapses in mice. These antibodies may be a potential therapeutic target and serve as a biomarker to distinguish a small but treatable subgroup in heterogeneous patients with schizophrenia.

Abstract: T-cell lymphoma (TCL) is a highly heterogeneous group of invasive non-Hodgkin lymphoma with adverse prognosis and limited treatment options. The relationship between TCL and Exportin-1 (XPO1), a major nuclear export receptor, has not been established yet. We here investigated the prognostic role and therapeutic implication of XPO1 in TCL. We analyzed XPO1 expression in a cohort of 69 TCL tumors and found that XPO1 was over-expressed in 76.8% of TCL and correlated with decreased progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In vitro treatment of TCL cell lines with KPT-8602, the second-generation selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE), inhibited XPO1 expression and showed significant anti-proliferative, cell-cycle arrest and pro-apoptotic efficacy. In mechanism, KPT-8602 restored the localization of cytoplasmic FOXO3A, p27, p21, IκBα and PP2A into the nucleus, leading to AKT and NF-κB deactivation. Our data demonstrate for the first time that XPO1 could be an unfavorable prognostic factor for TCL, and provide a rationale for further investigation of the efficacy of KPT-8602 in TCL patients.

Abstract: Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are involved in muscle maintenance and regeneration. Mechanically loaded MuSCs within their native niche undergo tensile and shear deformations, but how MuSCs sense mechanical stimuli and translate these into biochemical signals regulating function and fate is still poorly understood. We aimed to investigate whether the glycocalyx is involved in the MuSC mechanoresponse, and whether MuSC morphology affects mechanical loading-induced pressure, shear stress, and fluid velocity distribution. FSS-induced deformation of active proliferating MuSCs (myoblasts) with intact or degraded glycocalyx was assessed by live-cell imaging. Glycocalyx-degradation did not significantly affect nitric oxide production, but reduced FSS-induced myoblast deformation and modulated gene expression. Finite-element analysis revealed that the distribution of FSS-induced pressure, shear stress, and fluid velocity on myoblasts was non-uniform, and the magnitude depended on myoblast morphology and apex-height. In conclusion, our results suggest that the glycocalyx does not play a role in NO production in myoblasts but might impact mechanotransduction and gene expression, which needs further investigation. Future studies will unravel the underlying mechanism by which the glycocalyx affects FSS-induced myoblast deformation, which might be related to increased drag forces. Moreover, MuSCs with varying apex-height experience different levels of FSS-induced pressure, shear stress, and fluid velocity, suggesting differential responsiveness to fluid shear forces.

Abstract: Summary
Human primary natural killer (NK) cells are being widely advanced for cancer immunotherapy. However, methods for gene editing of these cells have suffered low transduction rates, high cell death, and loss of transgene expression after expansion. Here, we developed a highly efficient method for site-specific gene insertion in NK cells using CRISPR (Cas9/RNP) and AAVs. We compared AAV vectors designed to mediate gene insertion by different DNA repair mechanisms, homology arm lengths, and virus concentrations. We then validated the method for site-directed gene insertion of CD33-specific CARs into primary human NK cells. CAR transduction was efficient, its expression remained stable after expansion, and it improved efficacy against AML targets.

Abstract: Summary
Two-dimensional (2D) cultures of intestinal and colonic epithelium can be generated using human intestinal stem cells (hISCs) derived from primary tissue sources. These 2D cultures are emerging as attractive and versatile alternatives to three-dimensional organoid cultures; however, transgenesis and gene-editing approaches have not been developed for hISCs grown as 2D monolayers. Using 2D cultured hISCs we show that electroporation achieves up to 80% transfection in hISCs from six anatomical regions with around 64% survival and produces 0.15% transgenesis by PiggyBac transposase and 35% gene edited indels by electroporation of Cas9-ribonucleoprotein complexes at the OLFM4 locus. We create OLFM4-emGFP knock-in hISCs, validate the reporter on engineered 2D crypt devices, and develop complete workflows for high-throughput cloning and expansion of transgenic lines in 3–4 weeks. New findings demonstrate small hISCs expressing the highest OLFM4 levels exhibit the most organoid forming potential and show utility of the 2D crypt device to evaluate hISC function.

Abstract: Summary
Metal-dependent protein phosphatases (PPMs) have essential roles in a variety of cellular processes, including inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, and stress responses, which are intensively investigated in cancer and metabolic diseases. Targeting PPMs to modulate host immunity in response to pathogens is an ambitious proposition. The feasibility of such a strategy is unproven because development of inhibitors against PPMs is challenging and suffers from poor selectivity. Combining a biomimetic modularization strategy with function-oriented synthesis, we design, synthesize and screen more than 500 pseudo-natural products, resulting in the discovery of a potent, selective, and non-cytotoxic small molecule inhibitor for PPM1A, SMIP-30. Inhibition of PPM1A with SMIP-30 or its genetic ablation (ΔPPM1A) activated autophagy through a mechanism dependent on phosphorylation of p62-SQSTM1, which restricted the intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages and in the lungs of infected mice. SMIP-30 provides proof of concept that PPMs are druggable and promising targets for the development of host-directed therapies against tuberculosis.

Abstract: Summary
Complex distortions on calcium imaging often impair image registration accuracy. Here, we developed a registration algorithm, PatchWarp, to robustly correct slow image distortion for calcium imaging data. PatchWarp is a two-step algorithm with rigid and non-rigid image registrations. To correct non-uniform image distortions, it splits the imaging field and estimates the best affine transformation matrix for each of the subfields. The distortion-corrected subfields are stitched together like a patchwork to reconstruct the distortion-corrected imaging field. We show that PatchWarp robustly corrects image distortions of calcium imaging data collected from various cortical areas through glass window or gradient-index (GRIN) lens with a higher accuracy than existing non-rigid algorithms. Furthermore, it provides a fully automated method of registering images from different imaging sessions for longitudinal neural activity analyses. PatchWarp improves the quality of neural activity analyses and is useful as a general approach to correct image distortions in a wide range of disciplines.

Abstract: Summary
Antimicrobials can impact bacterial physiology and host immunity with negative treatment outcomes. Extensive exposure to antifolate antibiotics promotes thymidine-dependent Staphylococcus aureus small colony variants (TD-SCVs), commonly associated with worse clinical outcomes. We show that antibiotic-mediated disruption of thymidine synthesis promotes elevated levels of the bacterial second messenger cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), consequently inducing host STING activation and inflammation. An initial antibiotic screen in Firmicutes revealed that c-di-AMP production was largely driven by antifolate antibiotics targeting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which promotes folate regeneration required for thymidine biosynthesis. Additionally, TD-SCVs exhibited excessive c-di-AMP production and STING activation in a thymidine-dependent manner. Murine lung infection with TD-SCVs revealed STING-dependent elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, causing higher airway neutrophil infiltration and activation compared with normal-colony S. aureus and hemin-dependent SCVs. Collectively, our results suggest that thymidine metabolism disruption in Firmicutes leads to elevated c-di-AMP-mediated STING-dependent inflammation, with potential impacts on antibiotic usage and infection outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Modulation of immune function at the tumor site could improve patient outcomes. Here, we analyze patient samples of metastatic melanoma, a tumor responsive to T cell-based therapies, and find that tumor-infiltrating T cells are primarily juxtaposed to CD14+ monocytes/macrophages rather than melanoma cells. Using immunofluorescence-guided laser capture microdissection, we analyze transcriptomes of CD3+ T cells, CD14 + monocytes/macrophages, and melanoma cells in non-dissociated tissue. Stromal CD14+ cells display a specific transcriptional signature distinct from CD14+ cells within tumor nests. This signature contains LY75, a gene linked with antigen capture and regulation of tolerance and immunity in dendritic cells (DCs). When applied to TCGA cohorts, this gene set can distinguish patients with significantly prolonged survival in metastatic cutaneous melanoma and other cancers. Thus, the stromal CD14+ cell signature represents a candidate biomarker and suggests that reprogramming of stromal macrophages to acquire DC function may offer a therapeutic opportunity for metastatic cancers.

Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs play a critical role in the occurrence and development of human malignancies. Nonetheless, it remains unknown whether Gamma-Butyrobetaine Hydroxylase 1-Antisense RNA 1 (BBOX1-AS1) participates in the regulation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) carcinogenesis. Herein, we validated that BBOX1-AS1 was notably overexpressed in ESCC tissues compared to the adjacent non-tumor tissues and significantly correlated with tumor sizes. BBOX1-AS1 enhanced the malignant behavior of ESCC cells in vitro, such as cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, knockdown of BBOX1-AS1 augmented the proportion of apoptotic cells in ESCC cells. Mechanistically, BBOX1-AS1 regulated HOXB7 expression, and rescue experiments indicated that silencing of HOXB7 could abolish the malignant phenotypes mediated by BBOX1-AS1 to a certain extent. Moreover, HOXB7 participated in the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In summary, our findings substantiated that BBOX1-AS1 could activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by upregulating HOXB7 expression to promote ESCC progression, providing a rationale to develop novel therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) associate with growing microtubule plus ends and control microtubule dynamics and interactions with different cellular structures during cell division, cell migration and morphogenesis. Microtubule-associated RP/EB family member 2 (MAPRE2/EB2) is a highly conserved core component of +TIPs networks, but whether this molecule is required for mammalian meiotic progression is unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of MAPRE2 during oocyte maturation. Our results showed that MAPRE2 was consistently expressed from germinal vesicle (GV) to metaphase II (MII) stages and that MAPRE2 was distributed in the cytoplasm of oocytes at GV stage and along the spindle at metaphase I (MI) and MII stages. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Mapre2 severely impaired microtubule stability, kinetochore-microtubule attachment, and chromosome alignment and subsequently caused spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) activation and cyclin B1 nondegradation, leading to failure of chromosome segregation and first polar body extrusion. This study demonstrates for the first time that MAPRE2 plays an important role during mouse oocyte meiosis.

Abstract: Summary
The spinal cord emerges from a niche of neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) formed and maintained by WNT/fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals at the posterior end of the embryo. NMPs can be generated from human pluripotent stem cells and hold promise for spinal cord replacement therapies. However, NMPs are transient, which compromises production of the full range of rostrocaudal spinal cord identities in vitro. Here we report the generation of NMP-derived pre-neural progenitors (PNPs) with stem cell-like self-renewal capacity. PNPs maintain pre-spinal cord identity for 7–10 passages, dividing to self-renew and to make neural crest progenitors, while gradually adopting a more posterior identity by activating colinear HOX gene expression. The HOX clock can be halted through GDF11-mediated signal inhibition to produce a PNP and NC population with a thoracic identity that can be maintained for up to 30 passages.

Abstract: Scarring is the primary factor of maxilla growth restriction among people who have undergone cleft palate repair surgery. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) promotes fibrosis in a variety of organs. However, its role in post-surgery scarring on the hard palate has not been fully understood. This study is designed to investigate the role of p38MAPK in scar formation and maxilla growth of rats. We removed the mucosa on the hard palate of rats and applied the p38MAPK silencing adenovirus vector on it two weeks after surgery. Then the scarring tissue and maxilla growth were evaluated by histological and morphological examination. The effect of p38MAPK silencing on scarring-related genes in fibroblasts was also studied. We found that local injection of Ad-p38MAPK-1 in vivo effectively reduces the expression of p38MAPK and scarring-related proteins and weakens the impact of scarring on the width of the hard palate. Mechanistically, p38MAPK silencing inhibits the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) via mediating the production and nuclear localization of myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) in fibroblasts. These results reveal a molecular pathway of scar formation involving p38MAPK/MRTF-A stimulation and support targeting p38MAPK as a potentially effective treatment for post-surgery scarring on the hard palate.

Abstract: Niemann Pick type C is an inborn error of metabolism (IEM), classified as a lysosomal storage disease (LSD) caused by a dysfunction in NPC transport protein, that leads to intracellular accumulation of non-esterified cholesterol and other lipids. Clinical manifestations are ample, with visceral and neurological symptoms. Miglustat, a molecule that reversibly inhibits glucosylceramide synthase is used as treatment for this disorder. Studies demonstrated the influence of oxidative stress and inflammation in IEM, as well in animal model of NP-C disease. Nonetheless, literature lacks data on patients, so our work aimed to investigate if there is influence of chronic inflammation in the pathophysiology of NP-C disease, and the effect of miglustat, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). We evaluated the plasmatic cytokines in NPC patients at diagnosis and during the treatment with miglustat. Additionally, we performed an in vitro study with antioxidants NAC (1 mM and 2.5 mM) and CoQ10 (5 μM and 10 μM), where we could verify its effect on inflammatory parameters, as well as in cholesterol accumulation. Our results showed that NP-C patients have higher plasmatic levels of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) at diagnosis and the treatment with miglustat was able to restore it. In vitro study showed that treatment with antioxidants in higher concentrations significantly decrease cholesterol accumulation, and NAC at 2.5 mM normalized the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although the mechanism is not completely clear, it can be related to restoration in lipid traffic and decrease in oxidative stress caused by antioxidants.

Abstract: Summary
In vivo calcium imaging enables simultaneous recording of large neuronal ensembles engaged in complex operations. Many experiments require monitoring and identification of cell populations across multiple sessions. Population cell tracking across multiple sessions is complicated by non-rigid transformations induced by cell movement and imaging field shifts. We introduce SCOUT (Single-Cell spatiOtemporal longitUdinal Tracking), a fast, robust cell-tracking method utilizing multiple cell-cell similarity metrics, probabilistic inference, and an adaptive clustering methodology, to perform cell identification across multiple sessions. By comparing SCOUT with earlier cell-tracking algorithms on simulated, 1-photon, and 2-photon recordings, we show that our approach significantly improves cell-tracking quality, particularly when recordings exhibit spatial footprint movement between sessions or sub-optimal neural extraction quality.

Abstract: Diabetic cataract (DC) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lens epithelial cells (LECs) is a crucial event in the development of DC. Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes EMT by regulating diverse targets. However, little is known about how MDM2 is involved in the pathogenesis of DC. We found the mRNA and protein levels of MDM2 were up-regulated in the lens of DC patients and rats. Thus, high glucose (HG)-induced human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) were constructed for further investigation. The results showed that the level of MDM2 was increased in HG-cultured HLECs, and the MDM2 knockdown alleviated HG-induced abnormal migration, EMT, and oxidative stress damage. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays demonstrated that MDM2 down-regulated LKB1 expression by ubiquitination degradation. LKB1 was found to be lower expressed in human and rat DC lenses, and HG-stimulated HLECs. Also, LKB1 overexpression mitigated HG-induced dysfunction of HLECs. Finally, our data showed that the changes related to EMT and oxidative stress induced by MDM2 knockdown were restored by down-regulation of LKB1. Together, MDM2 may involve in the pathogenesis of DC through down-regulating LKB1. MDM2 might be an effective therapeutical target of DC.

Abstract: Summary
Oocytes and granulosa cells closely interact with each other during follicular development, and a lack of appropriate signaling between them results in infertility. Attempts to manipulate oocyte microenvironment have been impeded by the impermeability of the blood-follicle barrier (BFB). To establish a strategy for manipulating oogenesis, we use adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), which have a unique ability of transcytosis. Microinjecting of AAVs into the ovarian stroma penetrates the BFB and achieves long-term gene expression. Introduction of an AAV carrying the mouse Kitl gene restores oogenesis in congenitally infertile KitlSl-t/KitlSl-t mutant mouse ovaries, which lack Kitl expression but contain only primordial follicles. Healthy offspring without AAV integration are born by natural mating. Therefore, AAV-mediated gene delivery not only provides a means for studying oocyte-granulosa interactions through the manipulation of the oocyte microenvironment but could also be a powerful method to treat female infertility resulting from somatic cell defects.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in the microbiota composition are associated with many human diseases, but factors that govern strain abundance remain poorly defined. We show that a commensal Escherichia coli strain and a pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolate both utilize nitrate for intestinal growth, but each accesses this resource in a distinct biogeographical niche. Commensal E. coli utilizes epithelial-derived nitrate, whereas nitrate in the niche occupied by S. Typhimurium is derived from phagocytic infiltrates. Surprisingly, avirulent S. Typhimurium was shown to be unable to utilize epithelial-derived nitrate because its chemotaxis receptors McpB and McpC exclude the pathogen from the niche occupied by E. coli. In contrast, E. coli invades the niche constructed by S. Typhimurium virulence factors and confers colonization resistance by competing for nitrate. Thus, nutrient niches are not defined solely by critical resources, but they can be further subdivided biogeographically within the host into distinct microhabitats, thereby generating new niche opportunities for distinct bacterial species.

Abstract: Summary
The B cell “help” function of CD4+ T cells is an important mechanism of adaptive immunity. Here, we describe improved antigen-specific T-B cocultures for quantitative measurement of T cell-dependent B cell responses, with as few as ∼90 T cells. Utilizing M. tuberculosis (Mtb), we show that early priming and activation of CD4+ T cells is important for productive interaction between T and B cells and that similar effects are achieved by supplementing cocultures with monocytes. We find that monocytes promote survivability of B cells via BAFF and stem cell growth factor (SCGF)/C-type lectin domain family 11 member A (CLEC11A), but this alone does not fully recapitulate the effects of monocyte supplementation. Importantly, we demonstrate improved activation and immunological output of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific memory CD4+ T-B cell cocultures with the inclusion of monocytes. This method may therefore provide a more sensitive assay to evaluate the B cell help quality of memory CD4+ T cells, for example, after vaccination or natural infection.

Abstract: Summary
Acinetobacter baumannii is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, where outbreaks are driven by its ability to persist on surfaces in a desiccated state. Here, we show that A. baumannii causes more virulent pneumonia following desiccation and profile the genetic requirements for desiccation. We find that desiccation tolerance is enhanced upon the disruption of Lon protease, which targets unfolded and aggregated proteins for degradation. Notably, two bacterial hydrophilins, DtpA and DtpB, are transcriptionally upregulated in Δlon via the two-component regulator, BfmR. These proteins, both hydrophilic and intrinsically disordered, promote desiccation tolerance in A. baumannii. Additionally, recombinant DtpA protects purified enzymes from inactivation and improves the desiccation tolerance of a probiotic bacterium when heterologously expressed. These results demonstrate a connection between environmental persistence and pathogenicity in A. baumannii, provide insight into the mechanisms of extreme desiccation tolerance, and reveal potential applications for bacterial hydrophilins in the preservation of protein- and live bacteria-based pharmaceuticals.

Abstract: Subretinal fibrosis causes local damage to the retina and irreversible vision loss, as the final stage of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). More recently, the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) has been considered one of the most significant sources of myofibroblasts in subretinal fibrosis, though the underpinning molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, a series of experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that Yes-associated protein (YAP) may be involved in EndoMT and subretinal fibrosis. We demonstrated that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2 stimulation induces YAP dephosphorylation (activated) and nuclear transcription in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Moreover, TGF-β2-mediated EndoMT and proinflammatory cytokine production in HUVECs were reduced by ROS clearance or YAP knockdown. Furthermore, the severity of subretinal fibrosis was markedly relieved by intravitreal administration of a small interfering RNA targeting YAP in the mouse laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) model. Our findings provide novel insights into a previously unknown effect of YAP on the EndoMT process and reveal YAP as a potential target for suppressing CNV-related subretinal fibrosis and protect vision.

Abstract: Summary
Optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry is an important tool for investigating learning in vivo. Numerous approaches to pulse design have been employed to elicit desirable circuit and behavioral outcomes. Here, we systematically test the outcome of different single-pulse waveforms in a rate-based model of hippocampal memory function at the level of mnemonic replay extension and de novo synaptic weight formation in CA3 and CA1. Lower-power waveforms with long forward or forward and backward ramps yield more natural sequence replay dynamics and induce synaptic plasticity that allows for more natural memory replay timing, in contrast to square or backward ramps. These differences between waveform shape and amplitude are preserved with the addition of noise in membrane potential, light scattering, and protein expression, improving the potential validity of predictions for in vivo work. These results inform future optogenetic experimental design choices in the field of learning and memory.

Abstract: Summary
Adoptive therapies with genetically modified somatic T cells rendered HIV resistance have shown promise for AIDS therapy. A renewable source of HIV-resistant human T cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) would further facilitate and broaden the applicability of these therapies. Here, we report successful targeting of the CCR5 locus in iPSCs generated from T cells (T-iPSCs) or fibroblasts (fib-iPSCs) from Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM), using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We found that CCR5 editing does not affect hematopoietic and T cell differentiation potentials of fib-iPSCs. However, T-iPSCs with edited CCR5 lost their capacity to differentiate into CD4+CD8+ T cells while maintaining myeloid differentiation potential. T cells and macrophages produced from CCR5-edited MCM iPSCs did not support replication of the CCR5-tropic simian immunodeficiency viruses SIVmac239 (T cell tropic) and SIVmac316 (macrophage-tropic). Overall, these studies provide a platform for further exploration of AIDS therapies based on gene-edited iPSCs in a nonhuman primate model.

Abstract: Summary
NOTCH signaling is a key regulator involved in maintaining intestinal stem cell (ISC) homeostasis and for balancing differentiation. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we observed that OLFM4, a NOTCH target gene present in ISCs, is first expressed at 13 weeks post-conception in the developing human intestine and increases over time. This led us to hypothesize that the requirement for NOTCH signaling is acquired across human development. To test this, we established a series of epithelium-only organoids (enteroids) from different developmental stages and used γ-secretase inhibitors (dibenzazepine [DBZ] or DAPT) to functionally block NOTCH signaling. Using quantitative enteroid-forming assays, we observed a decrease in enteroid forming efficiency in response to γ-secretase inhibition as development progress. When DBZ was added to cultures and maintained during routine passaging, enteroids isolated from tissue before 20 weeks had higher recovery rates following single-cell serial passaging. Finally, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis 1 day and 3 days after DBZ treatment showed major differences in the transcriptional changes between developing or adult enteroids. Collectively, these data suggest that ISC dependence on NOTCH signaling increases as the human intestine matures.

Abstract: Summary
Malaria-causing Plasmodium vivax parasites can linger in the human liver for weeks to years and reactivate to cause recurrent blood-stage infection. Although they are an important target for malaria eradication, little is known about the molecular features of replicative and non-replicative intracellular liver-stage parasites and their host cell dependence. Here, we leverage a bioengineered human microliver platform to culture patient-derived P. vivax parasites for transcriptional profiling. Coupling enrichment strategies with bulk and single-cell analyses, we capture both parasite and host transcripts in individual hepatocytes throughout the course of infection. We define host- and state-dependent transcriptional signatures and identify unappreciated populations of replicative and non-replicative parasites that share features with sexual transmissive forms. We find that infection suppresses the transcription of key hepatocyte function genes and elicits an anti-parasite innate immune response. Our work provides a foundation for understanding host-parasite interactions and reveals insights into the biology of P. vivax dormancy and transmission.

Abstract: PLIN2 has been found to be dysregulated in several human malignancies, which influences cancer progression. However, the roles of PLIN2 in regulating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression are still unclear. Here, we revealed that PLIN2 was frequently upregulated in HCC cells and tissues, and increased PLIN2 expression was associated with poor prognosis outcomes in HCC. In HCC cells, overexpressing PLIN2 promoted cell proliferation, PLIN2-deficiency inhibited cell vitality. Mechanistically, silencing of PLIN2 expression downregulated hypoxia inducible factor 1-α (HIF1α) expression and this downregulation in turn inhibited the targeting genes of HIF1α. Furthermore, we found that PLIN2 stabilized and retarded the degradation of the HIF1α through autophagy-lysosomal pathway by inhibiting AMPK/ULK1. Collectively, we clarified the carcinogenic role of PLIN2 in HCC and suggested a prognostic biomarker for diagnosis and clinical therapy in the future.

Abstract: Protein targets of polyADP-ribosylation undergo covalent modification with high-molecular-weight, branched poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) of lengths up to 200 or more ADP-ribose residues derived from NAD+. PAR polymerase 1 (PARP1) is the most abundant and well-characterized enzyme involved in PAR biosynthesis. Extensive studies have been carried out to determine how polyADP-ribosylation (PARylation) regulates cell proliferation during cell cycle, with conflicting conclusions. Since significant activation of PARP1 occurs during cell lysis in vitro, we changed the standard method for cell lysis, and using our sensitive ELISA system, quantified without addition of a PAR glycohydrolase inhibitor and clarified that the PAR level is significantly higher in S phase than that in G1. Under normal condition in the absence of exogenous DNA-damaging agent, PAR turns over with a half-life of <40 s; consistent with significant decrease of NAD+ levels in S phase, which is rescued by PARP inhibitors, in line with the observed rapid turnover of PAR. PARP inhibitors delayed cell cycle in S phase and decreased cell proliferation. Our results underscore the importance of a suitable assay system to measure rapid PAR chain dynamics in living cells and aid our understanding of the function of PARylation during the cell cycle.

Abstract: Background
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as novel players in cancer metabolism. lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 7 (SNHG7) plays an oncogenic role in prostate cancer (PCa). However, the role and mechanism of SNHG7 in PCa metabolism remain largely undefined.
Methods
A cohort of 30 PCa tumors and their counterparts were collected. qRT-PCR was employed to detect target gene expression and RNA stability. CCK-8 assay was used to assess cell viability. N6‐methyladenosine (m6A) level was measured by a commercial kit. Cell glycolysis was evaluated by measuring glucose uptake, lactate, ATP production and Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Bioinformatics analysis and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were used to verify the interactions among SNHG7, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) and c-Myc.
Results
SNHG7 and c-Myc were highly expressed in PCa tissues and cells. Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated m6A modification of SNHG7 and enhanced its stability. Silencing of SNHG7 suppressed proliferation and glycolysis in PCa cells. Mechanistically, SNHG7 regulated c-Myc via interacting with SRSF1. Gain- and loss-of function experiments revealed that SNHG7 promoted glycolysis via SRSF1/c-Myc axis in PC-3 and DU-145 cells.
Conclusion
METTL3-stabilized lncRNA SNHG7 accelerates glycolysis in PCa via SRSF1/c-Myc axis and inspires the understanding of m6A roles in lncRNA metabolism and tumor progression.

Abstract: Myoepithelial cells (MECs) are responsible for receiving stimuli from the central nervous system and translating their responses into the form of secretion into glandular tissue, including salivary glands (SG), sweet glands, and mammary glands. SG MECs cause the secretion of serous saliva by contracting of acini/ductal cells with acetylcholine (Ach) from parasympathetic nerves via muscarinic receptors. To response the parasympathetic physiological stimulation, SG epithelial cell-derived MECs are supposed to be induced and placed adjacent to parasympathetic system nerve ends in SGs by forming a neuro-myoepithelial junction. For salivary secretion to function under parasympathetic control, therefore, specific regions of salivary gland epithelial cells must be mapped and the epithelium near the nerve must differentiate into MECs in order to form a nerve-myoepithelial junction during organogenesis. We hypothesized that the epithelium near the parasympathetic nerves is induced the differentiation into MECs by which the neurotransmitter acetylcholine via muscarinic receptors. qPCR and whole-mount immunohistochemical analysis in ex vivo organ culture system revealed that SG epithelial cells near a parasympathetic nerve were found to be induced to differentiate into MECs via the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1 by carbachol (CCh), an acetylcholine agonist. In addition, CCh stimulated ERK and Akt signaling for the induction of MEC differentiation in rat submandibular gland epithelial cells. These findings indicate that muscarinic action is required for the induction of MECs and formation of a neuro-myoepithelial junction in developing SGs. This study proposes a novel concept for tissue architecture to form a neuro-myoepithelial junction during neurofunctional organogenesis including SGs.

Abstract: Breast cancer, the most prevalent malignancy in women, is also the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. The activation of the Wnt pathway plays a pivotal role in the metastatic abilities of breast cancer. In this study, IL1F6, MRGPRX1, and SEC14L3 were significantly correlated to breast cancer patients'overall survival based on TCGA-BRCA dataset. Although IL1F6, MRGPRX1 and SEC14L3 high expression were associated with better survival in breast cancer patients, SEC14L3 had the biggest survival benefit for breast cancer; therefore, SEC14L3 was selected for the subsequent investigation. SEC14L3 mRNA expression and protein levels within breast cancer cell lines decreased compared with normal human breast epithelial cells. Overexpressing SEC14L3 in breast cancer cells inhibited the malignant phenotypes of cancer cells, including the capacity of cells to migrate and invade. SEC14L3 overexpression decreased the levels of mesenchymal markers, whereas SEC14L3 knockdown facilitated the malignant behaviors of breast cancer cells. SEC14L3 overexpression also inhibited Wnt/β-catenin activation. The Wnt agonist strengthened the malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells; moreover, the anti-tumor effects of SEC14L3 overexpression were partially attenuated by the Wnt agonist. Conclusively, SEC14L3, which is underexpressed in breast cancer cells and tissues, could play a tumor-suppressive role in a Wnt/β-catenin-related way.

Abstract: Summary
Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), a model for differentiation into primed epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), have revealed transcriptional and epigenetic control of early embryonic development. The control and significance of morphological changes, however, remain less defined. We show marked changes in morphology and actin architectures during differentiation that depend on Arp2/3 complex but not formin activity. Inhibiting Arp2/3 complex activity pharmacologically or genetically does not block exit from naive pluripotency, but attenuates increases in EpiLC markers. We find that inhibiting Arp2/3 complex activity delays formative pluripotency and causes globally defective lineage specification as indicated by RNA sequencing, with significant effects on TBX3-depedendent transcriptional programs. We also identify two previously unreported indicators of mESC differentiation, namely, MRTF and FHL2, which have inverse Arp2/3 complex-dependent nuclear translocation. Our findings on Arp2/3 complex activity in differentiation and the established role of formins in EMT indicate that these two actin nucleators regulate distinct modes of epithelial plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
The perpetual arms race between bacteria and their viruses (phages) has given rise to diverse immune systems, including restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas, which sense and degrade phage-derived nucleic acids. These complex systems rely upon production and maintenance of multiple components to achieve antiphage defense. However, the prevalence and effectiveness of minimal, single-component systems that cleave DNA remain unknown. Here, we describe a unique mode of nucleic acid immunity mediated by a single enzyme with nuclease and helicase activities, herein referred to as Nhi (nuclease-helicase immunity). This enzyme provides robust protection against diverse staphylococcal phages and prevents phage DNA accumulation in cells stripped of all other known defenses. Our observations support a model in which Nhi targets and degrades phage-specific replication intermediates. Importantly, Nhi homologs are distributed in diverse bacteria and exhibit functional conservation, highlighting the versatility of such compact weapons as major players in antiphage defense.

Abstract: Summary
Probiotics are increasingly administered to premature infants to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis and neonatal sepsis. However, their effects on gut microbiome assembly and immunity are poorly understood. Using a randomized intervention trial in extremely premature infants, we tested the effects of a probiotic product containing four strains of Bifidobacterium species autochthonous to the infant gut and one Lacticaseibacillus strain on the compositional and functional trajectory of microbiome. Daily administration of the mixture accelerated the transition into a mature, term-like microbiome with higher stability and species interconnectivity. Besides infant age, Bifidobacterium strains and stool metabolites were the best predictors of microbiome maturation, and structural equation modeling confirmed probiotics as a major determinant for the trajectory of microbiome assembly. Bifidobacterium-driven microbiome maturation was also linked to an anti-inflammatory intestinal immune milieu. This demonstrates that Bifidobacterium strains are ecosystem engineers that lead to an acceleration of microbiome maturation and immunological consequences in extremely premature infants.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer in dogs and humans, with significant numbers of patients experiencing treatment failure and disease progression. In our search for new approaches to treat osteosarcoma, we previously detected multiple chaperone proteins in the surface-exposed proteome of canine osteosarcoma cells. In the present study, we characterized expression of representative chaperones and find evidence for stress adaptation in canine osteosarcoma cells relative to osteogenic progenitors from normal bone. We compared the cytotoxic potential of direct (HA15) and putative (OSU-03012) inhibitors of Grp78 function and found canine POS and HMPOS osteosarcoma cells to be more sensitive to both compounds than normal cells. HA15 and OSU-03012 increased the thermal stability of Grp78 in intact POS cells at low micromolar concentrations, but each induced distinct patterns in Grp78 expression without significant change in Grp94. Both inhibitors were as effective alone as carboplatin and showed little evidence of synergy in combination treatment. However, HMPOS cells with acquired resistance to carboplatin were sensitive to inhibition of Grp78 (by HA15; OSU-03012), Hsp70 (by VER-155008), and Hsp90 (by 17-AAG) function. These results suggest that multiple nodes within the osteosarcoma chaperome may be relevant chemotherapeutic targets against platinum resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Localized prostate cancer exhibits multiple genomic alterations and heterogeneity at the proteomic level. Single-cell technologies capture important cell-to-cell variability responsible for heterogeneity in biomarker expression that may be overlooked when molecular alterations are based on bulk tissue samples. This study aims to identify prognostic biomarkers and describe the heterogeneity of prostate cancer and the associated microenvironment by simultaneously quantifying 36 proteins using single-cell mass cytometry analysis of over 1.6 million cells from 58 men with localized prostate cancer. We perform this task, using a high-dimensional clustering pipeline named Franken to describe subpopulations of immune, stromal, and prostate cells, including changes occurring in tumor tissues and high-grade disease that provide insights into the coordinated progression of prostate cancer. Our results further indicate that men with localized disease already harbor rare subpopulations that typically occur in castration-resistant and metastatic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary fibers act through the microbiome to improve cardiovascular health and prevent metabolic disorders and cancer. To understand the health benefits of dietary fiber supplementation, we investigated two popular purified fibers, arabinoxylan (AX) and long-chain inulin (LCI), and a mixture of five fibers. We present multiomic signatures of metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics, metagenomics, a cytokine panel, and clinical measurements on healthy and insulin-resistant participants. Each fiber is associated with fiber-dependent biochemical and microbial responses. AX consumption associates with a significant reduction in LDL and an increase in bile acids, contributing to its observed cholesterol reduction. LCI is associated with an increase in Bifidobacterium. However, at the highest LCI dose, there is increased inflammation and elevation in the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase. This study yields insights into the effects of fiber supplementation and the mechanisms behind fiber-induced cholesterol reduction, and it shows effects of individual, purified fibers on the microbiome.

Abstract: Summary
We present a bimodal endocytic tracer, fluorescent BSA-gold (fBSA-Au), as a fiducial marker for 2D and 3D correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) applications. fBSA-Au consists of colloidal gold (Au) particles stabilized with fluorescent BSA. The conjugate is efficiently endocytosed and distributed throughout the 3D endolysosomal network of cells and has an excellent visibility in both fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron microscopy (EM). We demonstrate that fBSA-Au facilitates rapid registration in several 2D and 3D CLEM applications using Tokuyasu cryosections, resin-embedded material, and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). Endocytosed fBSA-Au benefits from a homogeneous 3D distribution throughout the endosomal system within the cell, does not obscure any cellular ultrastructure, and enables accurate (50–150 nm) correlation of fluorescence to EM data. The broad applicability and visibility in both modalities makes fBSA-Au an excellent endocytic fiducial marker for 2D and 3D (cryo)CLEM applications.

Abstract: Summary
Over the last decade, sequencing of primary tumors has clarified the genetic underpinnings of Wilms tumor but has not affected therapy, outcome, or toxicity. We now sharpen our focus on relapse samples from the umbrella AREN03B2 study. We show that over 40% of relapse samples contain mutations in SIX1 or genes of the MYCN network, drivers of progenitor proliferation. Not previously seen in large studies of primary Wilms tumors, DIS3 and TERT are now identified as recurrently mutated. The analysis of primary-relapse tumor pairs suggests that 11p15 loss of heterozygosity (and other copy number changes) and mutations in WT1 and MLLT1 typically occur early, but mutations in SIX1, MYCN, and WTX are late developments in some individuals. Most strikingly, 75% of relapse samples had gain of 1q, providing strong conceptual support for studying circulating tumor DNA in clinical trials to better detect 1q gain earlier and monitor response.

Abstract: Summary
While immunopathology has been widely studied in patients with severe COVID-19, immune responses in non-hospitalized patients have remained largely elusive. We systematically analyze 484 peripheral cellular or soluble immune features in a longitudinal cohort of 63 mild and 15 hospitalized patients versus 14 asymptomatic and 26 household controls. We observe a transient increase of IP10/CXCL10 and interferon-β levels, coordinated responses of dominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and fewer CD8 T cells, and various antigen-presenting and antibody-secreting cells in mild patients within 3 days of PCR diagnosis. The frequency of key innate immune cells and their functional marker expression are impaired in hospitalized patients at day 1 of inclusion. T cell and dendritic cell responses at day 1 are highly predictive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses after 3 weeks in mild but not hospitalized patients. Our systematic analysis reveals a combinatorial picture and trajectory of various arms of the highly coordinated early-stage immune responses in mild COVID-19 patients.

Tunicamycin (TM) is an antibiotic that inhibits the first step in the N-linked glycosylation in eukaryotes and has been used as an ER stress inducer to activate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Mutualistic symbiosis in trypanosomatids is characterized by structural adaptations and intense metabolic exchanges, thus we investigated the effects of TM in the association between Angomonas deanei and its symbiotic bacterium, through ultrastructural and proteomic approaches. Cells treated with the inhibitor showed a decrease in proliferation, enlargement of the ER and Golgi cisternae and an increased distance between the symbiont and the ER. TM proved to be an important tool to better understand ER stress in trypanosomatids, since changes in protein composition were observed in the host protozoan, especially the expression of the Hsp90 chaperone. Furthermore, data obtained indicates the importance of the ER for the adaptation and maintenance of symbiotic associations between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, considering that this organelle has recognized importance in the biogenesis and division of cell structures.

Abstract: Melanoma spheroid-loaded 3D skin models allow for the study of crucial tumor characteristics and factors at a superior level because the neoplastic cells are integrated into essential human skin components, permitting tumor–skin model communication. Herein, we designed a melanoma-containing artificial dermis by inserting multicellular tumor spheroids from the metastatic phase of WM 1617 melanoma cells into an artificial dermis. We cultured multicellular melanoma spheroids by hanging drop method (250 cells per drop) with a size of 420 μm in diameter after incubation for 14 days. These spheroids were integrated into the dermal equivalents that had been previously preparedwith a type-I collagen matrix and healthy fibroblasts. The melanoma spheroid cells invaded and proliferated in the artificial dermis. Spheroids treated with a 1.0 μmol/L aluminum chloride phthalocyanine nanoemulsion in the absence of light showed high cell viability. In contrast, under irradiation with visible red light (660 nm) at 25 J/cm2, melanoma cells were killed and the healthy tissue was preserved, indicating that photodynamic therapy is effective in such a model. Therefore, the 3D skin melanoma model has potential to promote research in full-thickness skin model targeting optimized preclinical assays.

Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that the aberrant expression of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) is closely associated with cancer progression, including gastric cancer (GC), due to its role in maintaining protein stability. The 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 14 (PSMD14), a member of the DUBs family, is reported to be highly expressed in some types of cancer and its overexpression indicates poor prognosis, but the function of PSMD14 in GC remains unclear. To investigate this issue, we first analyzed the PSMD14 expression via the TNMplot database and found that PSMD14 was up-regulated in GC tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.01). PSMD14 knockdown notably inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, which was confirmed through in vivo experiments. However, PSMD14 overexpression presented the opposite effects. Additionally, we found that PSMD14 deletion inhibited the protein level of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), an activator of GC development. Further investigation confirmed that PSMD14 and PTBP1 presented co-localization and had an endogenous interaction. PSMD14 was revealed to promote the deubiquitination and stabilization of PTBP1, and PTBP1 knockdown reversed the effects caused by PSMD14 overexpression on cell function. Collectively, we demonstrate that PSMD14 as a deubiquitinating enzyme may promote the development of GC via stabilizing PTBP1, which provides a theoretical basis for a therapeutic target against GC.

Abstract: T-complex polypeptide-1 (TCP1) is a group II chaperonin that folds various cellular proteins. About 10% of cytosolic proteins in yeast have been shown to flux through the TCP1 protein complex indicating that it interacts and folds a plethora of substrate proteins that perform essential functions. In Leishmania donovani, the gamma subunit of TCP1 (LdTCP1γ) has been shown to form a homo-oligomeric complex and exhibited ATP-dependent protein folding activity. LdTCP1γ is essential for the growth and infectivity of the parasite. The interacting partners of L. donovani TCP1γ, involved in many cellular processes, are far from being understood. In this study, we utilized co-immunoprecipitation assay coupled with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) to unravel protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of LdTCP1γ in the L. donovani parasite. Label-free quantification (LFQ) proteomic analysis revealed 719 interacting partners of LdTCP1γ. String analysis showed that LdTCP1γ interacts with all subunits of TCP1 complex as well as other proteins belonging to pathways like metabolic process, ribosome, protein folding, sorting, and degradation. Trypanothione reductase, identified as one of the interacting partners, is refolded by LdTCP1γ. In addition, the differential expression of LdTCP1γ modulates the trypanothione reductase activity in L. donovani parasite. The study provides novel insight into the role of LdTCP1γ that will pave the way to better understand parasite biology by identifying the interacting partners of this chaperonin.

Abstract: Summary
The histone deacetylase paralogs HDAC1/2/3 and their corepressor complexes serve as epigenetic master regulators of chromatin function. Over the past decades, HDACs have been widely pursued as pharmacological targets, and considerable efforts have been invested in the development of small molecule drugs. Specifically, ortho-aminoanilide-derived inhibitors, including CI-994 and Cpd-60, stand out with their attractive selectivity profiles and have been used extensively as tools to delineate the biological roles of specific HDAC isoforms and complexes. Here, we apply a suite of activity-independent strategies to investigate how dynamic processes that regulate HDAC complexes govern the isoform and complex selectivity of HDAC inhibitors. Importantly, we find that overreliance on static and simplified biochemical activity assays has confounded the determination of the biological selectivity of these ligands. Our data urge a comprehensive reinterpretation of numerous studies utilizing these tool compounds for the interrogation of epigenetic and other cellular processes.

Abstract: Summary
With the aim of producing β cells for replacement therapies to treat diabetes, several protocols have been developed to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to β cells via pancreatic progenitors. While in vivo pancreatic progenitors expand throughout development, the in vitro protocols have been designed to make these cells progress as fast as possible to β cells. Here, we report on a protocol enabling a long-term expansion of human pancreatic progenitors in a defined medium on fibronectin, in the absence of feeder layers. Moreover, through a screening of a polymer library we identify a polymer that can replace fibronectin. Our experiments, comparing expanded progenitors to directly differentiated progenitors, show that the expanded progenitors differentiate more efficiently into glucose-responsive β cells and produce fewer glucagon-expressing cells. The ability to expand progenitors under defined conditions and cryopreserve them will provide flexibility in research and therapeutic production.

Abstract: Cardiac reprogramming has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach to regenerating the damaged heart by directly converting endogenous cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs). Cardiac reprogramming requires the activation of the cardiogenic transcriptional program in concert with the repression of the fibroblastic transcriptional program. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays an instrumental role in many physiological processes such as cell growth, differentiation and metabolism. The epigenetic modifications of histones are essential for the accurate expression of genes in cardiomyocytes and the normal functioning of the heart. However, the effect of LSD1 in regulating the cardiogenic transcriptional program under myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains unclear. Thus, mice I/R injury was induced by 4 and 24 h reperfusion after 1-h occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The primary CFs and CMs were exposed under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic I/R injury. The expression of LSD1 significantly decreased in I/R injured heart tissue and OGD-injured primary CFs and CM, and methylated histone presented a notable increase in OGD-injured primary CFs. Overexpression of LSD1 inhibited the injury of primary CFs induced by OGD, but showed limited inhibition on injured primary CMs. Under the OGD condition, LSD1 overexpression significantly increased cell viability, decreased cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of primary CFs. The expression of core cardiogenic transcription factors and cardiac genes were significantly decreased in OGD injured primary CFs, whereas LSD1 overexpression reversed the decrease of transcription factors and cardiac genes under the OGD condition. In conclusion, the overexpression of LSD1 has a protective role in I/R injury by inhibiting the histone methylation of primary CFs and regulates the expressions of core cardiogenic transcription factors and cardiac genes, which can prove to be a potential approach for direct cardiac reprogramming.

Abstract: Free radical release due to oxidative stress is gaining importance in the field of viral pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest the involvement of oxidative stress and ROS levels in regulating disease virulence during RNA virus infection. Most of the RNA virus infections lead to vascular dysfunction and disease severity. However, the biology of free radicals in maintaining vascular endothelium integrity is not completely understood. In the present review, we discuss some of the common features in positive-strand RNA virus infections such as dengue and SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that anti-oxidant therapy could pave the way to develop therapeutic strategies in combating emerging and re-emerging RNA viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Proteins assemble into a variety of dynamic and functional structures. Their structural transitions are often challenging to distinguish inside cells, particularly with a high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we present a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method for continuous and high-throughput monitoring of protein self-assemblies to reveal well-resolved transient intermediate states. Intermolecular FRET with both the donor and acceptor proteins at the same target protein provides high sensitivity while retaining the advantage of straightforward ratiometric imaging. We apply this method to monitor self-assembly of three proteins. We show that the mutant Huntingtin exon1 (mHttex1) first forms less-ordered assemblies, which develop into fibril-like aggregates, and demonstrate that the chaperone protein DNAJB6b increases the critical saturation concentration of mHttex1. We also monitor the structural changes in fused in sarcoma (FUS) condensates. This method adds to the toolbox for protein self-assembly structure and kinetics determination, and implementation with native or non-native proteins can inform studies involving protein condensation or aggregation.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (Ripk3) is one of the critical mediators of inflammatory cytokine-stimulated signaling. Here we show that Ripk3 signaling selectively regulates both the number and the function of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during stress conditions. Ripk3 signaling is not required for normal homeostatic hematopoiesis. However, in response to serial transplantation, inactivation of Ripk3 signaling prevents stress-induced HSC exhaustion and functional HSC attenuation, while in response to fractionated low doses of ionizing radiation (IR), inactivation of Ripk3 signaling accelerates leukemia/lymphoma development. In both situations, Ripk3 signaling is primarily stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-α. Activated Ripk3 signaling promotes the elimination of HSCs during serial transplantation and pre-leukemia stem cells (pre-LSCs) during fractionated IR by inducing Mlkl-dependent necroptosis. Activated Ripk3 signaling also attenuates HSC functioning and represses a pre-LSC-to-LSC transformation by promoting Mlkl-independent senescence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ripk3 signaling induces senescence in HSCs and pre-LSCs by attenuating ISR-mediated mitochondrial quality control.

Abstract: Summary
Selecting the right immunosuppressant to ensure rejection-free outcomes poses unique challenges in pediatric liver transplant (LT) recipients. A molecular predictor can comprehensively address these challenges. Currently, there are no well-validated blood-based biomarkers for pediatric LT recipients before or after LT. Here, we discover and validate separate pre- and post-LT transcriptomic signatures of rejection. Using an integrative machine learning approach, we combine transcriptomics data with the reference high-quality human protein interactome to identify network module signatures, which underlie rejection. Unlike gene signatures, our approach is inherently multivariate and more robust to replication and captures the structure of the underlying network, encapsulating additive effects. We also identify, in an individual-specific manner, signatures that can be targeted by current anti-rejection drugs and other drugs that can be repurposed. Our approach can enable personalized adjustment of drug regimens for the dominant targetable pathways before and after LT in children.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal firing patterns are the result of inputs converging onto single cells. Identifying these inputs, anatomically and functionally, is essential to understand how neurons integrate information. Single-cell electroporation of helper genes and subsequent local injection of recombinant rabies viruses enable precise mapping of inputs to individual cells in superficial layers of the intact cortex. However, access to neurons in deeper structures requires more invasive procedures, including removal of overlying tissue. We developed a method that, through a combination of virus injections, allows us to target 4 or fewer hippocampal cells 48% of the time and a single cell 16% of the time in wild-type mice without use of electroporation or tissue aspiration. We identify local and distant monosynaptic inputs that can be functionally characterized in vivo. By expanding the toolbox for monosynaptic circuit tracing, this method will help further our understanding of neuronal integration at the level of single cells.

Abstract: Summary
DNA-based devices are straightforward to design by virtue of their predictable folding, but they lack complex biological activity such as catalysis. Conversely, protein-based devices offer a myriad of functions but are much more difficult to design due to their complex folding. This study combines DNA and protein engineering to generate an enzyme that is activated by a DNA sequence of choice. A single protein switch, engineered from nanoluciferase using the alternate-frame-folding mechanism and herein called nLuc-AFF, is paired with different DNA technologies to create a biosensor for specific nucleic acid sequences, sensors for serotonin and ATP, and a two-input logic gate. nLuc-AFF is a genetically encoded, ratiometric, blue/green-luminescent biosensor whose output can be quantified by a phone camera. nLuc-AFF retains ratiometric readout in 100% serum, making it suitable for analyzing crude samples in low-resource settings. This approach can be applied to other proteins and enzymes to convert them into DNA-activated switches.

Abstract: Summary
A precise understanding of DNA methylation dynamics is of great importance for a variety of biological processes including cellular reprogramming and differentiation. To date, complex integration of multiple and distinct genome-wide datasets is required to realize this task. We present GwEEP (genome-wide epigenetic efficiency profiling) a versatile approach to infer dynamic efficiencies of DNA modifying enzymes. GwEEP relies on genome-wide hairpin datasets, which are translated by a hidden Markov model into quantitative enzyme efficiencies with reported confidence around the estimates. GwEEP predicts de novo and maintenance methylation efficiencies of Dnmts and furthermore the hydroxylation efficiency of Tets. Its design also allows capturing further oxidation processes given available data. We show that GwEEP predicts accurately the epigenetic changes of ESCs following a Serum-to-2i shift and applied to Tet TKO cells confirms the hypothesized mutual interference between Dnmts and Tets.

Abstract: Summary
Male infertility is responsible for approximately half of all cases of reproductive issues. Spermatogenesis originates in a small pool of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), which are of interest for therapy of infertility but remain not well defined in humans. Using multiparametric analysis of the side population (SP) phenotype and the α-6 integrin, THY1, and β-2 microglobulin cell markers, we identified a population of human primitive undifferentiated spermatogonia with the phenotype β-2 microglobulin (β-2M)−SPα-6+THY1+, which is highly enriched in stem cells. By analyzing the expression signatures of this SSC-enriched population along with other germinal progenitors, we established an exhaustive transcriptome of human spermatogenesis. Transcriptome profiling of the human β-2M−SPα-6+THY1+ population and comparison with the profile of mouse undifferentiated spermatogonia provide insights into the molecular networks and key transcriptional regulators regulating human SSCs, including the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional repressor HES1, which we show to be implicated in maintenance of SSCs in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Antibiotics are a modifiable iatrogenic risk factor for the most common human nosocomial fungal infection, invasive candidiasis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We found that antibiotics enhanced the susceptibility to murine invasive candidiasis due to impaired lymphocyte-dependent IL-17A- and GM-CSF-mediated antifungal immunity within the gut. This led to non-inflammatory bacterial escape and systemic bacterial co-infection, which could be ameliorated by IL-17A or GM-CSF immunotherapy. Vancomycin alone similarly enhanced the susceptibility to invasive fungal infection and systemic bacterial co-infection. Mechanistically, vancomycin reduced the frequency of gut Th17 cells associated with impaired proliferation and RORγt expression. Vancomycin’s effects on Th17 cells were indirect, manifesting only in vivo in the presence of dysbiosis. In humans, antibiotics were associated with an increased risk of invasive candidiasis and death after invasive candidiasis. Our work highlights the importance of antibiotic stewardship in protecting vulnerable patients from life-threatening infections and provides mechanistic insights into a controllable iatrogenic risk factor for invasive candidiasis.

Abstract: Malignancies including ovarian cancer (OvCa) are genetically unstable. Genomic integrity is maintained by tumor suppressor p53 and DNA damage response network, which crosstalk to each other via not well characterized mechanisms. In this work, we characterize features of damage-related signals in cultured epithelial OvCa cells and tumor biopsies. We found that endogenous burden of DNA damage in OvCa tissues were ubiquitously accumulated in high-grade malignancies than lower grade of cancer that cannot be obviously explained by disturbed function of in DNA damage response (DDR). In contrast, CHK1 phosphorylation (CHK1-pS345) marking the checkpoint activation in nucleolar compartments are prevalent in high-grade OvCa, coincident to the elevated DNA damage in nucleoplasm. Generation of CHK1-pS345 requires the presence of p53 protein in addition to the well-known activities of ATM/ATR kinases. Apparently, mutant forms of p53 possess higher activity in triggering CHK1 phosphorylation than wild type, implying a potential role of p53 in maintaining rDNA integrity. Loss of p53 function would cause replication stress in nucleoli. Altogether, our study reveals endogenous nucleoli stress in OvCa that is coupled to perturbed function of p53 in DNA repair.

Abstract: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a main contributor to induce low back pain, and the pathogenic mechanism of IVDD remains unclear. The nucleus pulposus (NP) is a component of the intervertebral disc (IVD) that provides protection from mechanical stimuli. The matrix stiffness of NP tissue increases during the process of disc degeneration. Although several studies have found that pathological mechanical stimuli induce NP cell senescence, which is relevant for NP degeneration, however, the effect of matrix stiffness on NP cell senescence is not clear. Therefore, in the present study, we used polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel with controllable stiffness to mimic the matrix stiffness of normal (4 kPa) and severely degenerated (20 kPa) NP tissue. Rat NP cells were isolated and cultured on substrates with different stiffness, and the cell proliferation, SA-β-gal activity, cell cycle, telomerase activity and the phenotype markers of NP cells were analyzed. Moreover, cytoskeleton staining and NP cellular Young's modulus on different substrates were also measured. To further investigate how substrate stiffness affects NP cell senescence, lysyl oxidase (LOX) was used to restore the extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis of NP cells. The expression levels of integrin β1 and p38 MAPK were then measured. Our results showed that the 20 kPa substrate significantly induced NP cell senescence compared to the 4 kPa substrate. NP cells cultured on the 20 kPa substrate failed to maintain the expression of their phenotype markers. Furthermore, the 20 kPa substrate induced an increase of Young's modulus of NP cells, which possibly through up regulating the expressions of integrin β1 and p38 MAPK. These results indicated that the integrin β1-p38 MAPK signaling pathway may participated in substrate stiffness induced senescence of NP cells. LOX significantly increased ECM synthesis and inhibited substrate stiffness induced NP cell senescence, which indicated that matrix mechanics may be essential for maintaining the function of NP cell. Our results may provide a new perspective on the mechanism of IVDD by pathological matrix mechanics.
