Abstract: Summary
Cystic kidney disease is a leading cause of morbidity in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). We characterize the misregulated metabolic pathways using cell lines, a TSC mouse model, and human kidney sections. Our study reveals a substantial perturbation in the arginine biosynthesis pathway in TSC models with overexpression of argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1). The rise in ASS1 expression is dependent on the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity. Arginine depletion prevents mTORC1 hyperactivation and cell cycle progression and averts cystogenic signaling overexpression of c-Myc and P65. Accordingly, an arginine-depleted diet substantially reduces the TSC cystic load in mice, indicating the potential therapeutic effects of arginine deprivation for the treatment of TSC-associated kidney disease.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the malignant brain tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). The survival of this disease is about 14 months after diagnosis. To date, temozolomide is known as first-line therapy for glioma. Drug resistance and severe side effects against this drug are important obstacles to the effective treatment of this cancer. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) can adjust the expression of several genes and is used as a new method of gene therapy. Recent studies have shown that siRNAs can increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs. This study aimed to understand the potential role and molecular mechanism of the combination therapy of B7H6-siRNA and temozolomide in glioblastoma cancer. U87 cells were treated with B7H6-siRNA and temozolomide, separately and in combination. Cell viability, stemness, cell migration, and apoptosis were measured. The results of this work presented the synergistic effect of B7H6-siRNA and temozolomide in inhibiting the cancerous features of the U87 cell line. Down-regulating B7H6-siRNA expression inhibited the cell viability of U87 glioblastoma cancer cells and increased their sensitivity to temozolomide. In addition, a noteworthy decrease in cell migration ability and stemness, an increase in apoptosis were observed in the combined groups compared to B7H6-siRNA and temozolomide individually. According to the results, a combination of B7H6-siRNA and temozolomide can be a promising strategy in glioblastoma cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated host-microbial interactions play critical roles in initiation and perpetuation of gut inflammation in Crohn’s disease (CD). However, the spatial distribution and interaction network across the intestine and its accessory tissues are still elusive. Here, we profile the host proteins and tissue microbes in 540 samples from the intestinal mucosa, submucosa-muscularis-serosa, mesenteric adipose tissues, mesentery, and mesenteric lymph nodes of 30 CD patients and spatially decipher the host-microbial interactions. We observe aberrant antimicrobial immunity and metabolic processes across multi-tissues during CD and determine bacterial transmission along with altered microbial communities and ecological patterns. Moreover, we identify several candidate interaction pairs between host proteins and microbes associated with perpetuation of gut inflammation and bacterial transmigration across multi-tissues in CD. Signature alterations in host proteins (e.g., SAA2 and GOLM1) and microbes (e.g., Alistipes and Streptococcus) are further imprinted in serum and fecal samples as potential diagnostic biomarkers, thus providing a rationale for precision diagnosis.

Abstract: Summary
Hemochorial placentas have evolved defense mechanisms to prevent the vertical transmission of viruses to the immunologically underdeveloped fetus. Unlike somatic cells that require pathogen-associated molecular patterns to stimulate interferon production, placental trophoblasts constitutively produce type III interferons (IFNL) through an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that transcripts of short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) embedded in miRNA clusters within the placenta trigger a viral mimicry response that induces IFNL and confers antiviral protection. Alu SINEs within primate-specific chromosome 19 (C19MC) and B1 SINEs within rodent-specific microRNA cluster on chromosome 2 (C2MC) produce dsRNAs that activate RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and downstream IFNL production. Homozygous C2MC knockout mouse trophoblast stem (mTS) cells and placentas lose intrinsic IFN expression and antiviral protection, whereas B1 RNA overexpression restores C2MCΔ/Δ mTS cell viral resistance. Our results uncover a convergently evolved mechanism whereby SINE RNAs drive antiviral resistance in hemochorial placentas, placing SINEs as integral players in innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Overlapping principles of embryonic and tumor biology have been described, with recent multi-omics campaigns uncovering shared molecular profiles between human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and adult tumors. Here, using a chemical genomic approach, we provide biological evidence that early germ layer fate decisions of hPSCs reveal targets of human cancers. Single-cell deconstruction of hPSCs-defined subsets that share transcriptional patterns with transformed adult tissues. Chemical screening using a unique germ layer specification assay for hPSCs identified drugs that enriched for compounds that selectively suppressed the growth of patient-derived tumors corresponding exclusively to their germ layer origin. Transcriptional response of hPSCs to germ layer inducing drugs could be used to identify targets capable of regulating hPSC specification as well as inhibiting adult tumors. Our study demonstrates properties of adult tumors converge with hPSCs drug induced differentiation in a germ layer specific manner, thereby expanding our understanding of cancer stemness and pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
Proteinaceous cysteines function as essential sensors of cellular redox state. Consequently, defining the cysteine redoxome is a key challenge for functional proteomic studies. While proteome-wide inventories of cysteine oxidation state are readily achieved using established, widely adopted proteomic methods such as OxICAT, Biotin Switch, and SP3-Rox, these methods typically assay bulk proteomes and therefore fail to capture protein localization-dependent oxidative modifications. Here we establish the local cysteine capture (Cys-LoC) and local cysteine oxidation (Cys-LOx) methods, which together yield compartment-specific cysteine capture and quantitation of cysteine oxidation state. Benchmarking of the Cys-LoC method across a panel of subcellular compartments revealed more than 3,500 cysteines not previously captured by whole-cell proteomic analysis. Application of the Cys-LOx method to LPS-stimulated immortalized murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDM), revealed previously unidentified, mitochondrially localized cysteine oxidative modifications upon pro-inflammatory activation, including those associated with oxidative mitochondrial metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The epicardium plays an essential role in cardiogenesis by providing cardiac cell types and paracrine cues to the developing myocardium. The human adult epicardium is quiescent, but recapitulation of developmental features may contribute to adult cardiac repair. The cell fate of epicardial cells is proposed to be determined by the developmental persistence of specific subpopulations. Reports on this epicardial heterogeneity have been inconsistent, and data regarding the human developing epicardium are scarce. Here we specifically isolated human fetal epicardium and used single-cell RNA sequencing to define its composition and to identify regulators of developmental processes. Few specific subpopulations were observed, but a clear distinction between epithelial and mesenchymal cells was present, resulting in novel population-specific markers. Additionally, we identified CRIP1 as a previously unknown regulator involved in epicardial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Overall, our human fetal epicardial cell-enriched dataset provides an excellent platform to study the developing epicardium in great detail.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrent JAK2 alterations are observed in myeloproliferative neoplasms, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and other hematologic malignancies. Currently available type I JAK2 inhibitors have limited activity in these diseases. Preclinical data support the improved efficacy of type II JAK2 inhibitors, which lock the kinase in the inactive conformation. By screening small molecule libraries, we identified a lead compound with JAK2 selectivity. We highlight analogs with on-target biochemical and cellular activity and demonstrate in vivo activity using a mouse model of polycythemia vera. We present a co-crystal structure that confirms the type II binding mode of our compounds with the “DFG-out” conformation of the JAK2 activation loop. Finally, we identify a JAK2 G993A mutation that confers resistance to the type II JAK2 inhibitor CHZ868 but not to our analogs. These data provide a template for identifying novel type II kinase inhibitors and inform further development of agents targeting JAK2 that overcome resistance.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiform (GBM), one of the most common, aggressive primary brain tumours, demonstrates resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy after surgical resection and treatment failure. Metformin (MET) has been shown to suppress the proliferative capacity and invasion ability of GBM cells by activating AMPK and inhibiting mTOR, but the effective dose exceeded the maximum tolerated dose. Artesunate (ART) can exert certain anti-tumour effects by activating the AMPK-mTOR axis and inducing autophagy in tumour cells. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of MET combined with ART combination therapy on autophagy and apoptosis in GBM cells. MET combined with ART treatment effectively suppressed the viability, mono-cloning ability, migration and invasion capacities, as well as metastatic ability of GBM cells. The underlying mechanism involved modulation of the ROS-AMPK-mTOR axis, which was confirmed using 3-methyladenine and rapamycin to inhibit or promote the effects of MET combined with ART, respectively. The study findings suggest that MET used in combination with ART can induce autophagy-dependent apoptosis in GBM cells by activating the ROS-AMPK-mTOR pathway, providing a potential new treatment for GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) neurons in the brainstem regulate the ventilatory response to hypercarbia. It is unclear how PHOX2B-polyalanine repeat mutations (PHOX2B-PARMs) alter the function of PHOX2B and perturb the formation of RTN neurons. Here, we generated human brainstem organoids (HBSOs) with RTN-like neurons from human pluripotent stem cells. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that expression of PHOX2B+7Ala PARM alters the differentiation trajectories of the hindbrain neurons and hampers the formation of the RTN-like neurons in HBSOs. With the unguided cerebral organoids (HCOs), PHOX2B+7Ala PARM interrupted the patterning of PHOX2B+ neurons with dysregulation of Hedgehog pathway and HOX genes. With complementary use of HBSOs and HCOs with a patient and two mutant induced pluripotent stem cell lines carrying different polyalanine repetition in PHOX2B, we further defined the association between the length of polyalanine repetition and malformation of RTN-respiratory center and demonstrated the potential toxic gain of function of PHOX2B-PARMs, highlighting the uniqueness of these organoid models for disease modeling.

Abstract: The Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) is an evolutionarily conserved scaffold protein involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and siRNA to reduce the expression of RACK1 in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells and Rat2 fibroblasts, respectively. RACK1-depleted cells were examined using coherence-controlled holographic microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. RACK1 depletion resulted in decreased cell proliferation, increased cell area and perimeter, and in the appearance of large binucleated cells suggesting a defect in the cell cycle progression. Our results show that the depletion of RACK1 has a pleiotropic effect on both epithelial and mesenchymal cell lines and support its essential role in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Oncoprotein-induced transcript 3 (OIT3) facilitates macrophage M2 polarization and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, however, whether OIT3 regulates tumor immunity remains largely unknown. Here we found that OIT3 was upregulated in HCC-associated macrophages, which inhibited CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Mechanistically, OIT3 increased the expression of PD-L1 on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) by activating NF-κB signaling, blockade of NF-κB reversed the immunosuppressive activity of TAMs and dampens HCC tumorigenesis. Our findings provide the molecular basis for OIT3 enhancing tumor immunosuppression and highlighted a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting the TAMs of HCC.

Abstract: Summary
It has been 15 years since repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was approved by the FDA for clinical depression treatment. Yet, the underlying mechanisms for rTMS-induced depression relief are not fully elucidated. This study analyzes TMS-electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 64 healthy control (HC) subjects and 53 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) before and after rTMS treatment. Prior to treatment, patients with MDD have lower activity in the DLPFC, the hippocampus (HPC), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and DLPFC-OFC connectivity compared with HCs. Following active rTMS treatment, patients with MDD show a significant increase in the DLPFC, HPC, and OFC. Notably, the increase in HPC activity is specifically associated with amelioration of depressive symptoms but not anxiety or sleep quality. The orbitofrontal-hippocampal pathway plays a crucial role in mediating depression relief following rTMS treatment. These findings suggest potential alternative targets for brain stimulation therapy against depression (chictr.org.cn: ChiCTR2100052007).

Abstract: Summary
Early weaning usually causes small intestine epithelial development abnormality, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal diseases. Glutamine (Gln), enriching in plasma and milk, is widely reported to benefit intestinal health. However, whether Gln affects intestinal stem cell (ISC) activity in response to early weaning is unclear. Here, both the early weaning mice and intestinal organoids were used to study the role of Gln in regulating ISC activities. Results showed that Gln ameliorated early weaning-induced epithelial atrophy and augmented the ISC-mediated epithelial regeneration. Gln deprivation disabled ISC-mediated epithelial regeneration and crypt fission in vitro. Mechanistically, Gln augmented WNT signaling in a dose-dependent manner to regulate ISC activity, while WNT signaling blockage abolished the effects of Gln on ISCs. Together, Gln accelerates stem cell-mediated intestinal epithelial development associated with the augmentation of WNT signaling, which provides novel insights into the mechanism by which Gln promotes intestinal health.

Abstract: Summary
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a multisystem syndrome. Integration of systems-level multi-modal datasets can provide a molecular understanding of PTSD. Proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenomic assays are conducted on blood samples of two cohorts of well-characterized PTSD cases and controls: 340 veterans and 180 active-duty soldiers. All participants had been deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan and exposed to military-service-related criterion A trauma. Molecular signatures are identified from a discovery cohort of 218 veterans (109/109 PTSD+/−). Identified molecular signatures are tested in 122 separate veterans (62/60 PTSD+/−) and in 180 active-duty soldiers (PTSD+/−). Molecular profiles are computationally integrated with upstream regulators (genetic/methylation/microRNAs) and functional units (mRNAs/proteins/metabolites). Reproducible molecular features of PTSD are identified, including activated inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic dysregulation, and impaired angiogenesis. These processes may play a role in psychiatric and physical comorbidities, including impaired repair/wound healing mechanisms and cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychiatric diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Ovarian cancer (OC) causes high mortality in women because of ineffective biomarkers for early diagnosis. Here, we perform metabolomics analysis on an initial training set of uterine fluid from 96 gynecological patients. A seven-metabolite-marker panel consisting of vanillylmandelic acid, norepinephrine, phenylalanine, beta-alanine, tyrosine, 12-S-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid, and crithmumdiol is established for detecting early-stage OC. The panel is further validated in an independent sample set from 123 patients, discriminating early OC from controls with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.957 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.894–1). Interestingly, we find elevated norepinephrine and decreased vanillylmandelic acid in most OC cells, resulting from excess 4-hydroxyestradiol that antagonizes the catabolism of norepinephrine by catechol-O-methyltransferase. Moreover, exposure to 4-hydroxyestradiol induces cellular DNA damage and genomic instability that could lead to tumorigenesis. Thus, this study not only reveals metabolic features in uterine fluid of gynecological patients but also establishes a noninvasive approach for the early diagnosis of OC.

Abstract: Summary
Fast prediction of the mode of action (MoA) for bioactive compounds would immensely foster bioactivity annotation in compound collections and may early on reveal off-targets in chemical biology research and drug discovery. Morphological profiling, e.g., using the Cell Painting assay, offers a fast, unbiased assessment of compound activity on various targets in one experiment. However, due to incomplete bioactivity annotation and unknown activities of reference compounds, prediction of bioactivity is not straightforward. Here we introduce the concept of subprofile analysis to map the MoA for both, reference and unexplored compounds. We defined MoA clusters and extracted cluster subprofiles that contain only a subset of morphological features. Subprofile analysis allows for the assignment of compounds to, currently, twelve targets or MoA. This approach enables rapid bioactivity annotation of compounds and will be extended to further clusters in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted protein degradation (TPD), as exemplified by proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), is an emerging drug discovery platform. PROTAC molecules, which typically contain a target protein ligand linked to an E3 ligase ligand, recruit a target protein to the E3 ligase to induce its ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we applied PROTAC approaches to develop broad-spectrum antivirals targeting key host factors for many viruses and virus-specific antivirals targeting unique viral proteins. For host-directed antivirals, we identified a small-molecule degrader, FM-74-103, that elicits selective degradation of human GSPT1, a translation termination factor. FM-74-103-mediated GSPT1 degradation inhibits both RNA and DNA viruses. Among virus-specific antivirals, we developed viral RNA oligonucleotide-based bifunctional molecules (Destroyers). As a proof of principle, RNA mimics of viral promoter sequences were used as heterobifunctional molecules to recruit and target influenza viral polymerase for degradation. This work highlights the broad utility of TPD to rationally design and develop next-generation antivirals.

Abstract: Summary
Social motivation is critical to the development of typical social functioning. Social motivation, specifically one or more of its components (e.g., social reward seeking or social orienting), could be relevant for understanding phenotypes related to autism. We developed a social operant conditioning task to quantify effort to access a social partner and concurrent social orienting in mice. We established that mice will work for access to a social partner, identified sex differences, and observed high test-retest reliability. We then benchmarked the method with two test-case manipulations. Shank3B mutants exhibited reduced social orienting and failed to show social reward seeking. Oxytocin receptor antagonism decreased social motivation, consistent with its role in social reward circuitry. Overall, we believe that this method provides a valuable addition to the assessment of social phenotypes in rodent models of autism and the mapping of potentially sex-specific social motivation neural circuits.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an essential role in macrophage polarization. However, the adverse effects of ROS reduction by influencing epigenetics are often ignored. In this study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate macrophages to increase the ROS in cells, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was used to reduce ROS. Inflammatory factors such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were used to evaluate the M1 polarization level of macrophages. Chip was used to detect the tri-methylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) level at the promoter site. It was found that the decrease of ROS in macrophages would also cause the increase of the H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6A and lead to the reduction of H3K27me3 in the NOX2 promoter, which would increase the transcription level of NOX2 and the production of ROS and ultimately promote the production of inflammatory factors. Knockout of KDM6A can reduce the transcription of NOX2 and the production of ROS of macrophages, thus preventing the M1 polarization of macrophages. The elimination of ROS in macrophages will affect macrophages by increasing KDM6A and making them produce more ROS, thus inducing oxidative stress. In comparison, direct inhibition of KDM6A can reduce ROS production and inhibit macrophage M1 polarization more effectively.

Abstract: Summary
In 2021, Plasmodium falciparum was responsible for 619,000 reported malaria-related deaths. Resistance has been detected to every clinically used antimalarial, urging the development of novel antimalarials with uncompromised mechanisms of actions. High-content imaging allows researchers to collect and quantify numerous phenotypic properties at the single-cell level, and machine learning-based approaches enable automated classification and clustering of cell populations. By combining these technologies, we developed a method capable of robustly differentiating and quantifying P. falciparum asexual blood stages. These phenotypic properties also allow for the quantification of changes in parasite morphology. Here, we demonstrate that our analysis can be used to quantify schizont nuclei, a phenotype that previously had to be enumerated manually. By monitoring stage progression and quantifying parasite phenotypes, our method can discern stage specificity of new compounds, thus providing insight into the compound’s mode of action.

Abstract: Summary
The nutritional requirements for human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) growth have not been extensively studied. Here, building on our prior work that established the suitable non-basal medium components for hiPSC growth, we develop a simplified basal medium consisting of just 39 components, demonstrating that many ingredients of DMEM/F12 are either not essential or are at suboptimal concentrations. This new basal medium along with the supplement, which we call BMEM, enhances the growth rate of hiPSCs over DMEM/F12-based media, supports derivation of multiple hiPSC lines, and allows differentiation to multiple lineages. hiPSCs cultured in BMEM consistently have enhanced expression of undifferentiated cell markers such as POU5F1 and NANOG, along with increased expression of markers of the primed state and reduced expression of markers of the naive state. This work describes titration of the nutritional requirements of human pluripotent cell culture and identifies that suitable nutrition enhances the pluripotent state.

Abstract: Vascular endothelial cells (VECs) injury is the first step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (AS). Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a significant role in VECs injury, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, the human umbilical vein endothelial cells were exposed to 100 μg/mL oxidized low-density lipoprotein for 24 h to establish AS model in vitro. We reported that mitochondrial dynamics disorder is a prominent feature of VECs in AS models and associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, the knockdown of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) in AS model significantly alleviated the mitochondrial dynamics disorder and VECs injury. On the contrary, DRP1 overexpression significantly aggravated this injury. Interestingly, atorvastatin (ATV), a classical anti-atherosclerotic drug, prominently inhibited the expression of DRP1 in AS models and similarly alleviated the mitochondrial dynamics disorder and VECs injury in vitro and in vivo. At the same time, we found that ATV alleviated VECs damage but did not significantly reduce lipid concentration in vivo. Our findings provide a potential therapeutic target of AS and a new mechanism of the anti-atherosclerotic effect of ATV.

Abstract: Heterotypic cell-in-cell structure (CICs) is the definition of the entry of one type of living cells into another type of cell. CICs between immune cells and tumor cells have been found to correlate with malignancy in many cancers. Since tumor immune microenvironment promotes non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression and drug resistance, we wondered the potential significance of heterotypic CICs in NSCLC. Heterotypic CICs was analyzed by histochemistry in an expanded spectrum of clinical lung cancer tissue specimens. In vitro study was performed using the mouse lung cancer cell line LLC and splenocytes. Our results revealed that CICs formed by lung cancer cells and infiltrated lymphocytes were correlated with malignancy of NSCLC. In addition, we found CICs mediated the transfer of lymphocyte mitochondria to tumor cells, and promoted cancer cell proliferation and anti-cytotoxicity by activating MAPK pathway and up-regulating PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, CICs induces glucose metabolism reprogramming of lung cancer cells by upregulating glucose intake and glycolytic enzyme. Our findings suggest that CICs formed by lung cancer cell and lymphocyte contribute to NSCLC progression and reprogramming of glucose metabolism, and might represent a previously undescribed pathway for drug resistance of NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Abnormal polyol metabolism is predominantly associated with diabetes, where excess glucose is converted to sorbitol by aldose reductase (AR). Recently, abnormal polyol metabolism has been implicated in phosphomannomutase 2 congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG) and an AR inhibitor, epalrestat, proposed as a potential therapy. Considering that the PMM2 enzyme is not directly involved in polyol metabolism, the increased polyol production and epalrestat’s therapeutic mechanism in PMM2-CDG remained elusive. PMM2-CDG, caused by PMM2 deficiency, presents with depleted GDP-mannose and abnormal glycosylation. Here, we show that, apart from glycosylation abnormalities, PMM2 deficiency affects intracellular glucose flux, resulting in polyol increase. Targeting AR with epalrestat decreases polyols and increases GDP-mannose both in patient-derived fibroblasts and in pmm2 mutant zebrafish. Using tracer studies, we demonstrate that AR inhibition diverts glucose flux away from polyol production toward the synthesis of sugar nucleotides, and ultimately glycosylation. Finally, PMM2-CDG individuals treated with epalrestat show a clinical and biochemical improvement.

Abstract: Summary
Primary liver cancer is a rising cause of cancer deaths in the US. Although immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors induces a potent response in a subset of patients, response rates vary among individuals. Predicting which patients will respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors is of great interest in the field. In a retrospective arm of the National Cancer Institute Cancers of the Liver: Accelerating Research of Immunotherapy by a Transdisciplinary Network (NCI-CLARITY) study, we use archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples to profile the transcriptome and genomic alterations among 86 hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma patients prior to and following immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Using supervised and unsupervised approaches, we identify stable molecular subtypes linked to overall survival and distinguished by two axes of aggressive tumor biology and microenvironmental features. Moreover, molecular responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment differ between subtypes. Thus, patients with heterogeneous liver cancer may be stratified by molecular status indicative of treatment response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Abstract: Scleroderma, the chronic autoimmune disease is a consequence of inflammation in the connective tissue. Prolonged duration affects formation of compact connective tissue strands (scarring) within the target organ. Endothelial cells undergoing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) are the source of fibroblast phenotype-resembling cells. EndMT contributes to reorganization of the focal adhesion proteins (FA), including integrins, and intensive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. However, in endothelial cells, the relationship between EndMT and the interaction of integrin receptors with lumican - a component of ECM, is still unclear. Our findings indicate that at the early stages of EndMT caused by Snail-1 transcription factor overexpression, the level of the β1 integrin subunit and its phosphorylation are elevated. Simultaneously, the changes in the level of proteins that build FAs and promote activation of integrin receptors as well as a decrease in lumican quantity were observed. These modulations contributed to increased migration of human microvascular endothelial cells, HMEC-1. Our findings were achieved by WB, ELISA and wound healing assay. Taken altogether, transfection of HMEC-1 cells with Snail-1 plasmids inducing the early stages of EndMT results in the increase of total FAK and integrin β1 phosphorylation as well as cell migration: phenomena which are modulated by interaction with lumican.

Abstract: Summary
Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) is associated with prognosis in copy-number-driven tumors, including high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), although the function of TLS and its interaction with copy-number alterations in HGSOC are not fully understood. In the current study, we confirm that TLS-high HGSOC patients show significantly better progression-free survival (PFS). We show that the presence of TLS in HGSOC tumors is associated with B cell maturation and cytotoxic tumor-specific T cell activation and proliferation. In addition, the copy-number loss of IL15 and CXCL10 may limit TLS formation in HGSOC; a list of genes that may dysregulate TLS function is also proposed. Last, a radiomics-based signature is developed to predict the presence of TLS, which independently predicts PFS in both HGSOC patients and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Overall, we reveal that TLS coordinates intratumoral B cell and T cell response to HGSOC tumor, while the cancer genome evolves to counteract TLS formation and function.

Abstract: Summary
Time-lapse microscopy is the only method that can directly capture the dynamics and heterogeneity of fundamental cellular processes at the single-cell level with high temporal resolution. Successful application of single-cell time-lapse microscopy requires automated segmentation and tracking of hundreds of individual cells over several time points. However, segmentation and tracking of single cells remain challenging for the analysis of time-lapse microscopy images, in particular for widely available and non-toxic imaging modalities such as phase-contrast imaging. This work presents a versatile and trainable deep-learning model, termed DeepSea, that allows for both segmentation and tracking of single cells in sequences of phase-contrast live microscopy images with higher precision than existing models. We showcase the application of DeepSea by analyzing cell size regulation in embryonic stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
The coronavirus (CoV) family includes several viruses infecting humans, highlighting the importance of exploring pan-CoV vaccine strategies to provide broad adaptive immune protection. We analyze T cell reactivity against representative Alpha (NL63) and Beta (OC43) common cold CoVs (CCCs) in pre-pandemic samples. S, N, M, and nsp3 antigens are immunodominant, as shown for severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS2), while nsp2 and nsp12 are Alpha or Beta specific. We further identify 78 OC43- and 87 NL63-specific epitopes, and, for a subset of those, we assess the T cell capability to cross-recognize sequences from representative viruses belonging to AlphaCoV, sarbecoCoV, and Beta-non-sarbecoCoV groups. We find T cell cross-reactivity within the Alpha and Beta groups, in 89% of the instances associated with sequence conservation >67%. However, despite conservation, limited cross-reactivity is observed for sarbecoCoV, indicating that previous CoV exposure is a contributing factor in determining cross-reactivity. Overall, these results provide critical insights in developing future pan-CoV vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Both the canonical Wnt and androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways are important for prostate organogenesis and homeostasis. How they crosstalk to regulate prostate stem cell behaviors remains unclear. Here, we show in lineage-tracing mouse models that although Wnt is essential for basal stem cell multipotency, ectopic Wnt activity promotes basal cell over-proliferation and squamous phenotypes, which are counteracted by elevated levels of androgen. In prostate basal cell organoids, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) antagonizes R-spondin-stimulated growth in a concentration-dependent manner. DHT down-regulates the expressions of a Wnt reporter and target genes, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses identify Wnt signaling as a key altered pathway. Mechanistically, DHT enhances AR and β-catenin protein binding, and CUT&RUN analyses reveal that ectopic AR sequesters β-catenin away from its Wnt-related cistrome. Our results suggest that an intermediate level of Wnt activity in prostate basal stem cells, achieved via AR-β-catenin interaction, is essential for normal prostate homeostasis.

Abstract: Background
The accurate identification and isolation of ovarian stem cells from mammalian ovaries remain a major challenge because of the lack of specific surface markers and suitable in vitro culture systems. Optimized culture conditions for in vitro expansion of ovarian stem cells would allow for identifying requirements of these stem cells for proliferation and differentiation that would pave the way to uncover role of ovarian stem cells in ovarian pathophysiology. Here, we used three-dimensional (3D) aggregate culture system for enrichment of ovarian stem cells and named them aggregate-derived stem cells (ASCs). We hypothesized that mimicking the ovarian microenvironment in vitro by using an aggregate model of the ovary would provide a suitable niche for the isolation of ovarian stem cells from adult mouse and human ovaries and wanted to find out the main cellular pathway governing the proliferation of these stem cells.
Results
We showed that ovarian aggregates take an example from ovary microenvironment in terms of expression of ovarian markers, hormone secretion and supporting the viability of the cells. We found that aggregates-derived stem cells proliferate in vitro as long-term while remained expression of germline markers. These ovarian stem cells differentiated to oocyte like cells in vitro spontaneously. Transplantation of these stem cells in to chemotherapy mouse ovary could restore ovarian structure. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that interleukin6 is upregulated pathway in ovarian aggregate-derived stem cells. Our data showed that JAK/Stat3 signaling pathway which is activated downstream of IL6 is critical for ovarian stem cells proliferation.
Conclusions
We developed a platform that is highly reproducible for in vitro propagation of ovarian stem cells. Our study provides a primary insight into cellular pathway governing the proliferation of ovarian stem cells.

Abstract: TM6SF2, predominantly expressed in the liver and intestine, is closely associated with lipid metabolism. We have demonstrated the presence of TM6SF2 in VSMCs within human atherosclerotic plaques. Subsequent functional studies were conducted to investigate its role in lipid uptake and accumulation in human vascular smooth muscle cells (HAVSMCs) using siRNA knockdown and overexpression techniques. Our results showed that TM6SF2 reduced lipid accumulation in oxLDL-stimulated VSMCs, likely through the regulation of lectin-like oxLDL receptor 1 (LOX-1) and scavenger receptor cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) expression. We concluded that TM6SF2 plays a role in HAVSMC lipid metabolism with opposing effects on cellular lipid droplet content by downregulation of LOX-1 and CD36 expression.

Abstract: Summary
Strenuous physical exercise causes a massive elevation in the concentration of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which correlates with effort intensity and duration. The cellular sources and physiological drivers of this phenomenon are unknown. Using methylation patterns of cfDNA and associated histones, we show that cfDNA in exercise originates mostly in extramedullary polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Strikingly, cardiomyocyte cfDNA concentration increases after a marathon, consistent with elevated troponin levels and indicating low-level, delayed cardiac cell death. Physical impact, low oxygen levels, and elevated core body temperature contribute to neutrophil cfDNA release, while muscle contraction, increased heart rate, β-adrenergic signaling, or steroid treatment fail to cause elevation of cfDNA. Physical training reduces neutrophil cfDNA release after a standard exercise, revealing an inverse relationship between exercise-induced cfDNA release and training level. We speculate that the release of cfDNA from neutrophils in exercise relates to the activation of neutrophils in the context of exercise-induced muscle damage.

Abstract: Summary
GD2-targeting immunotherapies have improved survival in children with neuroblastoma, yet on-target, off-tumor toxicities can occur and a subset of patients cease to respond. The majority of neuroblastoma patients who receive immunotherapy have been previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, making it paramount to identify neuroblastoma-specific antigens that remain stable throughout standard treatment. Cell surface glycoproteomics performed on human-derived neuroblastoma tumors in mice following chemotherapy treatment identified protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) to be abundantly expressed. Furthermore, PTK7 shows minimal expression on pediatric-specific normal tissues. We developed an anti-PTK7 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and find PTK7 CAR T cells specifically target and kill PTK7-expressing neuroblastoma in vitro. In vivo, human/murine binding PTK7 CAR T cells regress aggressive neuroblastoma metastatic mouse models and prolong survival with no toxicity. Together, these data demonstrate preclinical efficacy and tolerability for targeting PTK7 and support ongoing investigations to optimize PTK7-targeting CAR T cells for neuroblastoma.

Abstract: Summary
The strong dependency of almost all malignant tumors on methionine potentially offers a pathway for cancer treatment. We engineer an attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium to overexpress an L-methioninase with the aim of specifically depriving tumor tissues of methionine. The engineered microbes target solid tumors and induce a sharp regression in several very divergent animal models of human carcinomas, cause a significant decrease in tumor cell invasion, and essentially eliminate the growth and metastasis of these tumors. RNA sequencing analyses reveal that the engineered Salmonella reduce the expression of a series of genes promoting cell growth, cell migration, and invasion. These findings point to a potential treatment modality for many metastatic solid tumors, which warrants further tests in clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
We developed the aggregate characterization toolkit (ACT), a fully automated computational suite based on existing and widely used core algorithms to measure the number, size, and permeabilizing activity of recombinant and human-derived aggregates imaged with diffraction-limited and super-resolution microscopy methods at high throughput. We have validated ACT on simulated ground-truth images of aggregates mimicking those from diffraction-limited and super-resolution microscopies and showcased its use in characterizing protein aggregates from Alzheimer’s disease. ACT is developed for high-throughput batch processing of images collected from multiple samples and is available as an open-source code. Given its accuracy, speed, and accessibility, ACT is expected to be a fundamental tool in studying human and non-human amyloid intermediates, developing early disease stage diagnostics, and screening for antibodies that bind toxic and heterogeneous human amyloid aggregates.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to establish latency affects disease and response to treatment. The host factors that influence the establishment of latency remain elusive. We engineered a multi-fluorescent Mtb strain that reports survival, active replication, and stressed non-replication states and determined the host transcriptome of the infected macrophages in these states. Additionally, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify host factors that modulated the phenotypic state of Mtb. We validated hits in a phenotype-specific manner and prioritized membrane magnesium transporter 1 (MMGT1) for a detailed mechanistic investigation. Mtb infection of MMGT1-deficient macrophages promoted a switch to persistence, upregulated lipid metabolism genes, and accumulated lipid droplets during infection. Targeting triacylglycerol synthesis reduced both droplet formation and Mtb persistence. The orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR156 is a key inducer of droplet accumulation in ΔMMGT1 cells. Our work uncovers the role of MMGT1-GPR156-lipid droplets in the induction of Mtb persistence.

Targeting cytokine-like protein FAM3D lowers blood pressure in hypertension,

Abstract: Summary
Current antihypertensive options still incompletely control blood pressure, suggesting the existence of uncovered pathogenic mechanisms. Here, whether cytokine-like protein family with sequence similarity 3, member D (FAM3D) is involved in hypertension etiology is evaluated. A case-control study exhibits that FAM3D is elevated in patients with hypertension, with a positive association with odds of hypertension. FAM3D deficiency significantly ameliorates angiotensin II (AngII)-induced hypertension in mice. Mechanistically, FAM3D directly causes endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling and impairs endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, whereas 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine to induce eNOS uncoupling abolishes the protective effect of FAM3D deficiency against AngII-induced hypertension. Furthermore, antagonism of formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) and FPR2 or the suppression of oxidative stress blunts FAM3D-induced eNOS uncoupling. Translationally, targeting endothelial FAM3D by adeno-associated virus or intraperitoneal injection of FAM3D-neutralizing antibodies markedly ameliorates AngII- or deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt-induced hypertension. Conclusively, FAM3D causes eNOS uncoupling through FPR1- and FPR2-mediated oxidative stress, thereby exacerbating the development of hypertension. FAM3D may be a potential therapeutic target for hypertension.

Abstract: Summary
Pituitary organoids are promising graft sources for transplantation in treatment of hypopituitarism. Building on development of self-organizing culture to generate pituitary-hypothalamic organoids (PHOs) using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), we established techniques to generate PHOs using feeder-free hPSCs and to purify pituitary cells. The PHOs were uniformly and reliably generated through preconditioning of undifferentiated hPSCs and modulation of Wnt and TGF-β signaling after differentiation. Cell sorting using EpCAM, a pituitary cell-surface marker, successfully purified pituitary cells, reducing off-target cell numbers. EpCAM-expressing purified pituitary cells reaggregated to form three-dimensional pituitary spheres (3D-pituitaries). These exhibited high adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretory capacity and responded to both positive and negative regulators. When transplanted into hypopituitary mice, the 3D-pituitaries engrafted, improved ACTH levels, and responded to in vivo stimuli. This method of generating purified pituitary tissue opens new avenues of research for pituitary regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal loss and axonal demyelination underlie long-term functional impairments in patients affected by brain disorders such as ischemic stroke. Stem cell-based approaches reconstructing and remyelinating brain neural circuitry, leading to recovery, are highly warranted. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro and in vivo production of myelinating oligodendrocytes from a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived long-term neuroepithelial stem (lt-NES) cell line, which also gives rise to neurons with the capacity to integrate into stroke-injured, adult rat cortical networks. Most importantly, the generated oligodendrocytes survive and form myelin-ensheathing human axons in the host tissue after grafting onto adult human cortical organotypic cultures. This lt-NES cell line is the first human stem cell source that, after intracerebral delivery, can repair both injured neural circuitries and demyelinated axons. Our findings provide supportive evidence for the potential future use of human iPSC-derived cell lines to promote effective clinical recovery following brain injuries.

Abstract: Summary
Functional precision medicine platforms are emerging as promising strategies to improve pre-clinical drug testing and guide clinical decisions. We have developed an organotypic brain slice culture (OBSC)-based platform and multi-parametric algorithm that enable rapid engraftment, treatment, and analysis of uncultured patient brain tumor tissue and patient-derived cell lines. The platform has supported engraftment of every patient tumor tested to this point: high- and low-grade adult and pediatric tumor tissue rapidly establishes on OBSCs among endogenous astrocytes and microglia while maintaining the tumor’s original DNA profile. Our algorithm calculates dose-response relationships of both tumor kill and OBSC toxicity, generating summarized drug sensitivity scores on the basis of therapeutic window and allowing us to normalize response profiles across a panel of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and exploratory agents. Summarized patient tumor scores after OBSC treatment show positive associations to clinical outcomes, suggesting that the OBSC platform can provide rapid, accurate, functional testing to ultimately guide patient care.

Abstract: Background
Patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) have a compromised intestinal barrier with decreased barrier function and increased cell death. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) create a physicochemical barrier that anchors bacteria in the intestine. Recent studies have shown that the stimulator of interferons genes (STING) signaling pathway plays an important function in a number of inflammatory conditions.
Methods
The rat SAP model was established by retrograde injection of freshly prepared sodium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct. Serum amylase (AMY), lipase (LIPA), interleukin (IL)-6, interferon (IFN)-β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, intestinal-type fatty acid binding protein (FABP2), diamine oxidase (DAO) and endotoxin (ET) levels were measured in rats. H&E staining was used to assess histological changes in the intestine and pancreas. The expression of intestinal epithelial cell tight junction (TJ) proteins and STING signaling pathway proteins and genes were measured by RT- PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to analyze. The expression of STING signaling pathway proteins in pancreas were measured by Western blot were used to analyze. TUNEL was used to detect IECs death.
Results
Upregulation of STING pathway-related proteins and genes occurred after sap-induced IECs. In addition, C-176 reduced serum AMY, LIPA, TNF-α, IL-6, INF-β, FABP2, DAO and endotoxin levels and decreased pancreatic and intestinal histopathological injury in SAP rats; DMXAA aggravated serum AMY, LIPA, TNF-α, IL-6, INF-β, FABP2, DAO and endotoxin levels and increased pancreatic and intestinal histopathological injury in SAP rats.
Conlusions
The results suggest that inhibition of STING signaling can alleviate IECs after SAP, and activation of STING signaling can aggravate IECs after SAP.

Abstract: Background
Obesity is a serious public health issue worldwide, which is a risk factor of cardiovascular disorders. Obesity has been shown to be associated with subclinical myocardial injury, increasing the risk of heart failure. Our study aims to explore novel mechanisms underlying obesity-induced myocardial injury.
Methods
Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to establish a mouse model of obesity, and serum levels of TG, TCH, LDL, CK-MB, LDH, cTnI and BNP were examined. Inflammatory response was evaluated by determining the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α. Macrophage infiltration in the heart was examined by IHC staining, and H&E staining was applied to evaluate myocardial injury. Primary peritoneal macrophages were isolated from mice and treated with palmitic acid (PA). Macrophage polarization was evaluated by determine the expression of CCL2, iNOS, CD206 and arginase I via Western blot, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry. Co-IP assays were performed to examine the interaction between LEAP-2, GHSR and ghrelin.
Results
Hyperlipidemia, increased proinflammatory cytokines and myocardial injury were observed in mice with obesity, and silencing of LEAP-2 ameliorated HFD-induced hyperlipidemia, inflammation, and myocardial injury. Moreover, HFD-induced macrophage infiltration and M1 polarization were reversed by LEAP-2 knockdown in mice. Furthermore, silencing of LEAP-2 suppressed PA-induced M1 polarization but enhanced M2 polarization in vitro. LEAP-2 interacted with GHSR in macrophages, and knockdown of LEAP-2 promoted the interaction of GHSR and ghrelin. Overexpression of ghrelin enhanced LEAP-1 silencing-mediated suppression of inflammatory response and upregulation of M2 polarization in PA-induced macrophages.
Conclusion
Knockdown of LEAP-2 ameliorates obesity-induced myocardial injury via promoting M2 polarization.

Abstract: Summary
Quiescence is a hallmark of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) in the mammalian brain, and establishment and maintenance of quiescence is essential for life-long continuous neurogenesis. How NSCs in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus acquire their quiescence during early postnatal stages and continuously maintain quiescence in adulthood is poorly understood. Here, we show that Hopx-CreERT2-mediated conditional deletion of Nkcc1, which encodes a chloride importer, in mouse DG NSCs impairs both their quiescence acquisition at early postnatal stages and quiescence maintenance in adulthood. Furthermore, PV-CreERT2-mediated deletion of Nkcc1 in PV interneurons in the adult mouse brain leads to activation of quiescent DG NSCs, resulting in an expanded NSC pool. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of NKCC1 promotes NSC proliferation in both early postnatal and adult mouse DG. Together, our study reveals both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous roles of NKCC1 in regulating the acquisition and maintenance of NSC quiescence in the mammalian hippocampus.

Abstract: Summary
Cytokines are important mediators of the immune system, and their secretion level needs to be carefully regulated, as an unbalanced activity may lead to cytokine release syndromes. Dysregulation can be induced by various factors, including immunotherapies. Therefore, the need for risk assessment during drug development has led to the introduction of cytokine release assays (CRAs). However, the current CRAs offer little insight into the heterogeneous cellular dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we developed an advanced single-cell microfluidic-based cytokine secretion platform to quantify cytokine secretion on the single-cell level dynamically. Our approach identified different dynamics, quantities, and phenotypically distinct subpopulations for each measured cytokine upon stimulation. Most interestingly, early measurements after only 1 h of stimulation revealed distinct stimulation-dependent secretion dynamics and cytokine signatures. With increased sensitivity and dynamic resolution, our platform provided insights into the secretion behavior of individual immune cells, adding crucial additional information about biological stimulation pathways to traditional CRAs.

Abstract: Summary
Sarcomeres are fundamental to cardiac muscle contraction. Their impairment can elicit cardiomyopathies, leading causes of death worldwide. However, the molecular mechanism underlying sarcomere assembly remains obscure. We used human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) to reveal stepwise spatiotemporal regulation of core cardiac myofibrillogenesis-associated proteins. We found that the molecular chaperone UNC45B is highly co-expressed with KINDLIN2 (KIND2), a marker of protocostameres, and later its distribution overlaps with that of muscle myosin MYH6. UNC45B-knockout CMs display essentially no contractility. Our phenotypic analyses further reveal that (1) binding of Z line anchor protein ACTN2 to protocostameres is perturbed because of impaired protocostamere formation, resulting in ACTN2 accumulation; (2) F-ACTIN polymerization is suppressed; and (3) MYH6 becomes degraded, so it cannot replace non-muscle myosin MYH10. Our mechanistic study demonstrates that UNC45B mediates protocostamere formation by regulating KIND2 expression. Thus, we show that UNC45B modulates cardiac myofibrillogenesis by interacting spatiotemporally with various proteins.

Abstract: Background
Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most deadly and metastatic cancers of the urinary tract. Latest studies have confirmed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in a variety of cancers. Some of these lncRNAs code for small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), called small nucleolar RNA host genes (SNHGs), which exert some value in predicting the prognosis of certain cancer patients, but little is known regarding the function of SNHGs within the PCa.
Aim of the study
To explore the expression distribution and differential analysis of SNHGs in different tumors using RNA-seq and survival data from TCGA and GTEx, and to assess the potential impacts of the lncRNA SNHG25 on human PCa. To validate the expression of SNHG25 using experimental data and to investigate in detail its particular molecular biological function on PCa both in vivo and in vitro.
Methods
LncRNA SNHG25 expression was analyzed by bioinformatic prediction and qPCR. CCK-8, EdU, transwell, wound healing, and western blotting assays were conducted to investigate the main role of lncRNA SNHG25 in PCa. Xenograft tumour growth model in nude mice was surveyed by in vivo imaging and Ki-67 staining. AKT pathway activator (SC79) was used to verify the interaction among SNHG25 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
Results
Bioinformatics analysis and experimental research illuminated that the expression of lncRNA SNHG25 was observably up-regulated in PCa tissues and cells. Moreover, SNHG25 knockdown restrained PCa cell proliferation, invasion and migration, while promoting apoptosis. Xenografts model confirmed that the si-SNHG25 group had a significant inhibitory effect on PCa tumour growth in vivo. Additionally, a series of gain-of-function analyses suggested that SNHG25 could activate the PI3K/AKT pathway to accelerate PCa progression.
Conclusions
These in vitro and in vivo findings demonstrate that SNHG25 is highly expressed in PCa and facilitates PCa development through regulation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. SNHG25 acts as an oncogene to predict tumour malignancy and survival in PCa patients and may therefore become a promising potential molecular target for early detection and therapy of lethal PCa.

Abstract: Bortezomib, an FDA approved drug in 2003 for newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MM, had showed great efficacy in different clinical settings. However, many patients still developed resistance to Bortezomib, and the mechanism of action remains unelucidated. Here, we showed that Bortezomib resistance can be partially overcome by targeting a different subunit of 20 S complex - PSMB6. PSMB6 knock down by shRNA increased sensitivity to Bortezomib in resistant and sensitive cell line. Interestingly, a STAT3 inhibitor, Stattic, is shown to selectively inhibit PSMB6 and induce apoptosis in Bortezomib resistant and sensitive MM cells, even with IL-6 induction. Therefore, PSMB6 is a novel target for Bortezomib resistance and Stattic may offer a potential therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Biological systems are immensely complex, organized into a multi-scale hierarchy of functional units based on tightly regulated interactions between distinct molecules, cells, organs, and organisms. While experimental methods enable transcriptome-wide measurements across millions of cells, popular bioinformatic tools do not support systems-level analysis. Here we present hdWGCNA, a comprehensive framework for analyzing co-expression networks in high-dimensional transcriptomics data such as single-cell and spatial RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). hdWGCNA provides functions for network inference, gene module identification, gene enrichment analysis, statistical tests, and data visualization. Beyond conventional single-cell RNA-seq, hdWGCNA is capable of performing isoform-level network analysis using long-read single-cell data. We showcase hdWGCNA using data from autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer’s disease brain samples, identifying disease-relevant co-expression network modules. hdWGCNA is directly compatible with Seurat, a widely used R package for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analysis, and we demonstrate the scalability of hdWGCNA by analyzing a dataset containing nearly 1 million cells.

Lack of MHC-II is emerging as a causal factor in cancer immune evasion, and the development of small-molecule MHC-II inducers is an unmet clinical need. Here, we identified three MHC-II inducers, including pristane and its two superior derivatives, that potently induce MHC-II expression in breast cancer cells and effectively inhibit the development of breast cancer. Our data suggest that MHC-II is central in promoting the immune detection of cancer to increase the tumor infiltration of T cells and enhance anti-cancer immunity. By discovering the malonyl/acetyltransferase (MAT) domain in fatty acid synthase (FASN) as the direct binding target of MHC-II inducers, we demonstrate that evasion of immune detection and cancer metabolic reprogramming are directly linked by fatty acid-mediated MHC-II silencing. Collectively, we identified three MHC-II inducers and illustrated that lack of MHC-II caused by hyper-activated fatty acid synthesis to limit immune detection is a potentially widespread mechanism underlying the development of cancer.

Abstract: Wnt signaling drives nuclear translocation of β-catenin and its subsequent association with the DNA-bound TCF/LEF transcription factors, which dictate target gene specificity by recognizing Wnt responsive elements across the genome. β-Catenin target genes are therefore thought to be collectively activated upon Wnt pathway stimulation. However, this appears in contrast with the non-overlapping patterns of Wnt target gene expression in several contexts, including early mammalian embryogenesis. Here we followed Wnt target gene expression in human embryonic stem cells after Wnt pathway stimulation at a single-cell resolution. Cells changed gene expression program over time consistent with three key developmental events: i) loss of pluripotency, ii) induction of Wnt target genes, and iii) mesoderm specification. Contrary to our expectation, not all cells displayed equal amplitude of Wnt target gene activation; rather, they distributed in a continuum from strong to weak responders when ranked based on the expression of the target AXIN2. Moreover, high AXIN2 did not always correspond to elevated expression of other Wnt targets, which were activated in different proportions in individual cells. The uncoupling of Wnt target gene expression was also identified in single cell transcriptomics profiling of other Wnt-responding cell types, including HEK293T, murine developing forelimbs, and human colorectal cancer. Our finding underlines the necessity to identify additional mechanisms that explain the heterogeneity of the Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcriptional outputs in single cells.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling is central in cell fate regulation, and relevant information is encoded in its activity over time (i.e., dynamics). However, simultaneous dynamics quantification of several pathways in single mammalian stem cells has not yet been accomplished. Here we generate mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines simultaneously expressing fluorescent reporters for ERK, AKT, and STAT3 signaling activity, which all control pluripotency. We quantify their single-cell dynamics combinations in response to different self-renewal stimuli and find striking heterogeneity for all pathways, some dependent on cell cycle but not pluripotency states, even in ESC populations currently assumed to be highly homogeneous. Pathways are mostly independently regulated, but some context-dependent correlations exist. These quantifications reveal surprising single-cell heterogeneity in the important cell fate control layer of signaling dynamics combinations and raise fundamental questions about the role of signaling in (stem) cell fate control.

Abstract: Heat shock is a physiological and environmental stress that leads to the denaturation and inactivation of cellular proteins and is used in hyperthermia cancer therapy. Previously, we revealed that mild heat shock (42 °C) delays the mitotic progression by activating the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). However, it is unclear whether SAC activation is maintained at higher temperatures than 42 °C. Here, we demonstrated that a high temperature of 44 °C just before mitotic entry led to a prolonged mitotic delay in the early phase, which was shortened by the SAC inhibitor, AZ3146, indicating SAC activation. Interestingly, mitotic slippage was observed at 44 °C after a prolonged delay but not at 42 °C heat shock. Furthermore, the multinuclear cells were generated by mitotic slippage in 44 °C-treated cells. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that heat shock at 44 °C reduces the kinetochore localization of MAD2, which is essential for mitotic checkpoint activation, in nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells. These results indicate that 44 °C heat shock causes SAC inactivation even after full activation of SAC and suggest that decreased localization of MAD2 at the kinetochore is involved in heat shock-induced mitotic slippage, resulting in multinucleation. Since mitotic slippage causes drug resistance and chromosomal instability, we propose that there may be a risk of cancer malignancy when the cells are exposed to high temperatures.

Abstract: Summary
Over the last several years, a method has emerged that endows adult hepatocytes with in vitro proliferative capacity, producing chemically induced liver progenitors (CLiPs). However, there is a growing controversy regarding the origin of these cells. Here, we provide lineage tracing-based evidence that adult hepatocytes acquire proliferative capacity in vitro using rat and mouse models. Unexpectedly, we also found that the CLiP method allows biliary epithelial cells to acquire extensive proliferative capacity. Interestingly, after long-term culture, hepatocyte-derived cells (hepCLiPs) and biliary epithelial cell-derived cells (bilCLiPs) become similar in their gene expression patterns, and they both exhibit differentiation capacity to form hepatocyte-like cells. Finally, we provide evidence that hepCLiPs can repopulate injured mouse livers, reinforcing our earlier argument that CLiPs can be a cell source for liver regenerative medicine. This study advances our understanding of the origin of CLiPs and motivates the application of this technique in liver regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Excessive apoptosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells is the main pathological change in intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) progression. Pleomorphic adenoma gene like-2 (PLAGL2) plays a key role in cell apoptosis, however, the effect of PLAGL2 on IVDD has not been clarified yet. In this study, we established mouse IVDD models via the annulus fibrosis needle puncture, TUNEL and safranin O staining were used to verify the successful establishment of IVDD models, and PLAGL2 expression was detected in disc tissues. Then, NP cells isolated from disc tissues were used to construct PLAGL2 knockdown cells. PLAGL2 expression in NP cells was analyzed with qRT-PCR and Western blot. The impact of PLAGL2 on the viability, apoptosis, and mitochondria function of NP cells was evaluated by MTT assay, TUNEL, JC1 staining, and flow cytometry assay. Additionally, the regulatory mechanism of PLAGL2 was further assessed. We found that PLAGL2 was upregulated in IVDD disc tissues and serum deprivation (SD)-stimulated NP cells. PLAGL2 knockdown inhibited apoptosis and mitochondria damage in NP cells. Moreover, knockdown of PLAGL2 downregulated the expression of downstream apoptosis-related factors RASSF5, Nip3, and p73. Mechanically, PLAGL2 transcriptionally activated RASSF5 via binding to its promoter. In general, our findings indicate that PLAGL2 induces apoptosis in NP cells and aggravates IVDD progression. This study provides a promising therapeutic target for IVDD treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) is an evolutionarily conserved process that cells activate to tolerate DNA damage. TLS facilitates proliferation under DNA damage conditions and is exploited by cancer cells to gain therapy resistance. It has been so far challenging to analyze endogenous TLS factors such as PCNAmUb and TLS DNA polymerases in single mammalian cells due to a lack of suitable detection tools. We have adapted a flow cytometry-based quantitative method allowing detection of endogenous, chromatin-bound TLS factors in single mammalian cells, either untreated or exposed to DNA-damaging agents. This high-throughput procedure is quantitative, accurate, and allows unbiased analysis of TLS factors’ recruitment to chromatin, as well as occurrence of DNA lesions with respect to the cell cycle. We also demonstrate detection of endogenous TLS factors by immunofluorescence microscopy and provide insights into TLS dynamics upon DNA replication forks stalled by UV-C-induced DNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle function and regenerative capacity decline during aging, yet factors driving these changes are incompletely understood. Muscle regeneration requires temporally coordinated transcriptional programs to drive myogenic stem cells to activate, proliferate, fuse to form myofibers, and to mature as myonuclei, restoring muscle function after injury. We assessed global changes in myogenic transcription programs distinguishing muscle regeneration in aged mice from young mice by comparing pseudotime trajectories from single-nucleus RNA sequencing of myogenic nuclei. Aging-specific differences in coordinating myogenic transcription programs necessary for restoring muscle function occur following muscle injury, likely contributing to compromised regeneration in aged mice. Differences in pseudotime alignment of myogenic nuclei when comparing aged with young mice via dynamic time warping revealed pseudotemporal differences becoming progressively more severe as regeneration proceeds. Disruptions in timing of myogenic gene expression programs may contribute to incomplete skeletal muscle regeneration and declines in muscle function as organisms age.

Abstract: Summary
The microbes and microbial pathways that influence host inflammatory disease progression remain largely undefined. Here, we show that variation in atherosclerosis burden is partially driven by gut microbiota and is associated with circulating levels of uric acid (UA) in mice and humans. We identify gut bacterial taxa spanning multiple phyla, including Bacillota, Fusobacteriota, and Pseudomonadota, that use multiple purines, including UA as carbon and energy sources anaerobically. We identify a gene cluster that encodes key steps of anaerobic purine degradation and that is widely distributed among gut-dwelling bacteria. Furthermore, we show that colonization of gnotobiotic mice with purine-degrading bacteria modulates levels of UA and other purines in the gut and systemically. Thus, gut microbes are important drivers of host global purine homeostasis and serum UA levels, and gut bacterial catabolism of purines may represent a mechanism by which gut bacteria influence health.

Abstract: The Golgi complex is a highly dynamic organelle that regulates various cellular activities and yet maintains a distinct structure. Multiple proteins participate in Golgi structure/organization including the small GTPase Rab2. Rab2 is found on the cis/medial Golgi compartments and the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. Interestingly, Rab2 gene amplification occurs in a wide range of human cancers and Golgi morphological alterations are associated with cellular transformation. To learn how Rab2 ‘gain of function’ influences the structure/activity of membrane compartments in the early secretory pathway that may contribute to oncogenesis, NRK cells were transfected with Rab2B cDNA. We found that Rab2B overexpression had a dramatic effect on the morphology of pre- and early Golgi compartments that resulted in a decreased transport rate of VSV-G in the early secretory pathway. We monitored the cells for the autophagic marker protein LC3 based on the findings that depressed membrane trafficking affects homeostasis. Morphological and biochemical studies confirmed that Rab2 ectopic expression stimulated LC3-lipidation on Rab2-containing membranes that was dependent on GAPDH and utilized a non-canonical LC3-conjugation mechanism that is nondegradative. Golgi structural alterations are associated with changes in Golgi-associated signalling pathways. Indeed, Rab2 overexpressing cells had elevated Src activity. We propose that increased Rab2 expression facilitates cis Golgi structural changes that are maintained and tolerated by the cell due to LC3 tagging, and subsequent membrane remodeling triggers Golgi associated signaling pathways that may contribute to oncogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis loses its control in many diseases and might provide therapeutic targets. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is mediated by the uniporter channel (mtCU), formed by MCU and is regulated by the Ca2+-sensing gatekeeper, MICU1, which shows tissue-specific stoichiometry. An important gap in knowledge is the molecular mechanism of the mtCU activators and inhibitors. We report that all pharmacological activators of the mtCU (spermine, kaempferol, SB202190) act in a MICU1-dependent manner, likely by binding to MICU1 and preventing MICU1’s gatekeeping activity. These agents also sensitized the mtCU to inhibition by Ru265 and enhanced the Mn2+-induced cytotoxicity as previously seen with MICU1 deletion. Thus, MCU gating by MICU1 is the target of mtCU agonists and is a barrier for inhibitors like RuRed/Ru360/Ru265. The varying MICU1:MCU ratios result in different outcomes for both mtCU agonists and antagonists in different tissues, which is relevant for both pre-clinical research and therapeutic efforts.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) via designed peptides is an effective strategy to perturb their biological functions. The Elongin BC heterodimer (ELOB/C) binds to a BC-box motif and is essential for cancer cell growth. Here, we report a peptide that mimics the high-affinity BC-box of the PRC2-associated protein EPOP. This peptide tightly binds to the ELOB/C dimer (kD = 0.46 ± 0.02 nM) and blocks the association of ELOB/C with its interaction partners, both in vitro and in the cellular environment. Cancer cells treated with our peptide inhibitor showed decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and perturbed gene expression. Therefore, our work proposes that blocking the BC-box-binding pocket of ELOB/C is a feasible strategy to impair its function and inhibit cancer cell growth. Our peptide inhibitor promises novel mechanistic insights into the biological function of the ELOB/C dimer and offers a starting point for therapeutics linked to ELOB/C dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells demonstrate remarkable success in treating hematological malignancies, but their effectiveness in non-hematopoietic cancers remains limited. This study proposes enhancing CAR T cell function and localization in solid tumors by modifying the epigenome governing tissue-residency adaptation and early memory differentiation. We identify that a key factor in human tissue-resident memory CAR T cell (CAR-TRM) formation is activation in the presence of the pleotropic cytokine, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), which enforces a core program of both “stemness” and sustained tissue residency by mediating chromatin remodeling and concurrent transcriptional changes. This approach leads to a practical and clinically actionable in vitro production method for engineering peripheral blood T cells into a large number of “stem-like” CAR-TRM cells resistant to tumor-associated dysfunction, possessing an enhanced ability to accumulate in situ and rapidly eliminate cancer cells for more effective immunotherapy.

Abstract: Immunotherapy using PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors has been proved to be effective in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), albeit only in a fraction of patients. Emerging evidences indicate mTOR blockade and metformin may re-orchestrate the immune system in tumors. Herein, in this study we aimed to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of PD-1 monoclonal antibody with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or with the anti-diabetic drug metformin. The status of PD-1/PD-L1 and mTOR pathway was determined through analyzing the TCGA and CCLE data in TNBCs as well as by detection at mRNA and protein level. The inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis by anti-PD-1 combined with rapamycin or with metformin was evaluated in allograft mouse model of TNBC. The effects of combination therapy on the AMPK, mTOR and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways were also evaluated. The combination treatment with PD-1 McAb and rapamycin/metformin had additive effects on suppression of tumor growth and distant metastasis in mice. Compared with the control group and the monotherapy, combined PD-1 McAb with either rapamycin or metformin exhibited more obvious effects on induction of necrosis, CD8+ T lymphocytes infiltrating and inhibition of PD-L1 expression in TNBC homograft. In vitro study showed either rapamycin or metformin not only decreased PD-L1 expression, but increased p-AMPK expression and therefore led to down-regulation of p-S6. In summary, combination of PD-1 antagonist with either rapamycin or metformin led to more infiltrating TILs and decreased PD-L1 resulting in enhanced antitumor immunity and blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Our results suggested such combination therapy may be a potential therapeutic strategy for TNBC patients.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 is critical in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on previous reports of antibody catalysis, we investigated the proteolysis of spike (S) by antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) and its contribution to viral neutralization. Quenched fluorescent peptides were designed based on S epitopes to sensitively detect antibody-mediated proteolysis. We observed epitope cleavage by CCP from different donors which persisted when plasma was heat-treated or when IgG was isolated from plasma. Further, purified CCP antibodies proteolyzed recombinant S domains, as well as authentic viral S. Cleavage of S variants suggests CCP antibody-mediated proteolysis is a durable phenomenon despite antigenic drift. We differentiated viral neutralization occurring via direct interference with receptor binding from that occurring by antibody-mediated proteolysis, demonstrating that antibody catalysis enhanced neutralization. These results suggest that antibody-catalyzed damage of S is an immunologically relevant function of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Summary
The adult subventricular zone (SVZ) is a neurogenic niche that continuously produces newborn neurons. Here we show that serine racemase (SR), an enzyme that catalyzes the racemization of L-serine to D-serine and vice versa, affects neurogenesis in the adult SVZ by controlling de novo fatty acid synthesis. Germline and conditional deletion of SR (nestin precursor cells) leads to diminished neurogenesis in the SVZ. Nestin-cre+ mice showed reduced expression of fatty acid synthase and its substrate malonyl-CoA, which are involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis. Global lipidomic analyses revealed significant alterations in different lipid subclasses in nestin-cre+ mice. Decrease in fatty acid synthesis was mediated by phospho Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase that was AMP-activated protein kinase independent. Both L- and D-serine supplementation rescued defects in SVZ neurogenesis, proliferation, and levels of malonyl-CoA in vitro. Our work shows that SR affects adult neurogenesis in the SVZ via lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Time-specific modulation of gene expression during differentiation by transcription factors promotes cell diversity. However, estimating their dynamic regulatory activity at the single-cell level and in a high-throughput manner remains challenging. We present FateCompass, an integrative approach that utilizes single-cell transcriptomics data to identify lineage-specific transcription factors throughout differentiation. By combining a probabilistic framework with RNA velocities or differentiation potential, we estimate transition probabilities, while a linear model of gene regulation is employed to compute transcription factor activities. Considering dynamic changes and correlations of expression and activities, FateCompass identifies lineage-specific regulators. Our validation using in silico data and application to pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation datasets highlight both known and potentially novel lineage-specific regulators. Notably, we uncovered undescribed transcription factors of an enterochromaffin-like population during in vitro differentiation toward ß-like cells. FateCompass provides a valuable framework for hypothesis generation, advancing our understanding of the gene regulatory networks driving cell-fate decisions.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests a strong association between decreased lipid catabolism and the development of cancer. Solute carrier family 9 member A5 (SLC9A5) plays a regulatory role in colorectal function. However, the specific involvement of SLC9A5 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear, as well as its potential connection to lipid catabolism. We found that SLC9A5 exhibited significantly higher expression in CRC tumor tissues compared to adjacent paratumor tissues, as confirmed through analysis of the TCGA database and validation on a CRC tissue chip using IHC. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that knockdown of SLC9A5 resulted in suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Then we performed bioinformatics analysis and found that SLC9A5 was significantly enriched in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathway and negatively correlated with its first rate-limiting enzyme acyl-CoA oxidases (ACOX). Interestingly, the expression of ACOX1, as well as FAO process indicated by changes in very long chain fatty acid levels, were enhanced upon SLC9A5 knockdown in CRC cells. Moreover, the attenuated tumor growth, migration, invasion, and increased FAO observed after SLC9A5 knockdown could be reversed by simultaneous knockdown of both SLC9A5 and ACOX1. In summary, these findings reveal the oncogenic role of SLC9A5 in CRC, particularly in relation to ACOX1-mediated peroxidation, and might serve as a promising therapeutic target for inhibiting the progression of colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Summary
WNTs are essential factors for stem cell biology, embryonic development, and for maintaining homeostasis and tissue repair in adults. Difficulties in purifying WNTs and their lack of receptor selectivity have hampered research and regenerative medicine development. While breakthroughs in WNT mimetic development have overcome some of these difficulties, the tools developed so far are incomplete and mimetics alone are often not sufficient. Here, we developed a complete set of WNT mimetic molecules that cover all WNT/β-catenin-activating Frizzleds (FZDs). We show that FZD1,2,7 stimulate salivary gland expansion in vivo and salivary gland organoid expansion. We further describe the discovery of a novel WNT-modulating platform that combines WNT and RSPO mimetics’ effects into one molecule. This set of molecules supports better organoid expansion in various tissues. These WNT-activating platforms can be broadly applied to organoids, pluripotent stem cells, and in vivo research, and serve as bases for future therapeutic development.

Abstract: Summary
The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and heterologous immunization approaches implemented worldwide for booster doses call for diversified vaccine portfolios. GRAd-COV2 is a gorilla adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate encoding prefusion-stabilized spike. The safety and immunogenicity of GRAd-COV2 is evaluated in a dose- and regimen-finding phase 2 trial (COVITAR study, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04791423) whereby 917 eligible participants are randomized to receive a single intramuscular GRAd-COV2 administration followed by placebo, or two vaccine injections, or two doses of placebo, spaced over 3 weeks. Here, we report that GRAd-COV2 is well tolerated and induces robust immune responses after a single immunization; a second administration increases binding and neutralizing antibody titers. Potent, variant of concern (VOC) cross-reactive spike-specific T cell response peaks after the first dose and is characterized by high frequencies of CD8s. T cells maintain immediate effector functions and high proliferative potential over time. Thus, GRAd vector is a valuable platform for genetic vaccine development, especially when robust CD8 response is needed.

Abstract: Summary
Erythroblastic islands (EBIs) are the specialized structures for erythropoiesis, but they have never been found functional in tumors. As the most common pediatric liver malignancy, hepatoblastoma (HB) requires more effective and safer therapies to prevent progression and the lifelong impact of complications on young children. However, developing such therapies is impeded by a lack of comprehensive understanding of the tumor microenvironment. By single-cell RNA sequencing of 13 treatment-naive HB patients, we discover an immune landscape characterized by aberrant accumulation of EBIs, formed by VCAM1+ macrophages and erythroid cells, which is inversely correlated with survival of HB. Erythroid cells inhibit the function of dendritic cells (DCs) via the LGALS9/TIM3 axis, leading to impaired anti-tumor T cell immune responses. Encouragingly, TIM3 blockades relieve the inhibitory effect of erythroid cells on DCs. Our study provides an immune evasion mechanism mediated by intratumoral EBIs and proposes TIM3 as a promising therapeutic target for HB.

Abstract: Summary
The human gut microbiome composition is generally in a stable dynamic equilibrium, but it can deteriorate into dysbiotic states detrimental to host health. To disentangle the inherent complexity and capture the ecological spectrum of microbiome variability, we used 5,230 gut metagenomes to characterize signatures of bacteria commonly co-occurring, termed enterosignatures (ESs). We find five generalizable ESs dominated by either Bacteroides, Firmicutes, Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, or Escherichia. This model confirms key ecological characteristics known from previous enterotype concepts, while enabling the detection of gradual shifts in community structures. Temporal analysis implies that the Bacteroides-associated ES is “core” in the resilience of westernized gut microbiomes, while combinations with other ESs often complement the functional spectrum. The model reliably detects atypical gut microbiomes correlated with adverse host health conditions and/or the presence of pathobionts. ESs provide an interpretable and generic model that enables an intuitive characterization of gut microbiome composition in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
While combination therapy completely suppresses HIV-1 replication in blood, functional virus persists in CD4+ T cell subsets in non-peripheral compartments that are not easily accessible. To fill this gap, we investigated tissue-homing properties of cells that transiently appear in the circulating blood. Through cell separation and in vitro stimulation, the HIV-1 “Gag and Envelope reactivation co-detection assay” (GERDA) enables sensitive detection of Gag+/Env+ protein-expressing cells down to about one cell per million using flow cytometry. By associating GERDA with proviral DNA and polyA-RNA transcripts, we corroborate the presence and functionality of HIV-1 in critical body compartments utilizing t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering with low viral activity in circulating cells early after diagnosis. We demonstrate transcriptional HIV-1 reactivation at any time, potentially giving rise to intact, infectious particles. With single-cell level resolution, GERDA attributes virus production to lymph-node-homing cells with central memory T cells (TCMs) as main players, critical for HIV-1 reservoir eradication.

Abstract: Summary
Platinum (Pt) compounds are an important class of anti-cancer therapeutics, but outstanding questions remain regarding their mechanism of action. Here, we demonstrate that oxaliplatin, a Pt drug used to treat colorectal cancer, inhibits rRNA transcription through ATM and ATR signaling, and induces DNA damage and nucleolar disruption. We show that oxaliplatin causes nucleolar accumulation of the nucleolar DNA damage response proteins (n-DDR) NBS1 and TOPBP1; however transcriptional inhibition does not depend upon NBS1 or TOPBP1, nor does oxaliplatin induce substantial amounts of nucleolar DNA damage, distinguishing the nucleolar response from previously characterized n-DDR pathways. Taken together, our work indicates that oxaliplatin induces a distinct ATM and ATR signaling pathway that functions to inhibit Pol I transcription in the absence of direct nucleolar DNA damage, demonstrating how nucleolar stress and transcriptional silencing can be linked to DNA damage signaling and highlighting an important mechanism of Pt drug cytotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the only approved Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) vaccine, provides limited durable protection when administered intradermally. However, recent work revealed that intravenous (i.v.) BCG administration yielded greater protection in macaques. Here, we perform a dose-ranging study of i.v. BCG vaccination in macaques to generate a range of immune responses and define correlates of protection. Seventeen of 34 macaques had no detectable infection after Mtb challenge. Multivariate analysis incorporating longitudinal cellular and humoral immune parameters uncovered an extensive and highly coordinated immune response from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). A minimal signature predicting protection contained four BAL immune features, of which three remained significant after dose correction: frequency of CD4 T cells producing TNF with interferon γ (IFNγ), frequency of those producing TNF with IL-17, and the number of NK cells. Blood immune features were less predictive of protection. We conclude that CD4 T cell immunity and NK cells in the airway correlate with protection following i.v. BCG.

Abstract: Summary
Longitudinal microbiome data provide valuable insight into disease states and clinical responses, but they are challenging to mine and view collectively. To address these limitations, we present TaxUMAP, a taxonomically informed visualization for displaying microbiome states in large clinical microbiome datasets. We used TaxUMAP to chart a microbiome atlas of 1,870 patients with cancer during therapy-induced perturbations. Bacterial density and diversity were positively associated, but the trend was reversed in liquid stool. Low-diversity states (dominations) remained stable after antibiotic treatment, and diverse communities had a broader range of antimicrobial resistance genes than dominations. When examining microbiome states associated with risk for bacteremia, TaxUMAP revealed that certain Klebsiella species were associated with lower risk for bacteremia localize in a region of the atlas that is depleted in high-risk enterobacteria. This indicated a competitive interaction that was validated experimentally. Thus, TaxUMAP can chart comprehensive longitudinal microbiome datasets, enabling insights into microbiome effects on human health.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is characterized by poorer prognosis of patients and limited therapeutic approach, partly due to the lack of effective target. Using mouse models and tumor organoids, this study reported a tripartite motif 21 (TRIM21) protein, exerting potential inhibitory effects on the invasion and metastasis of CRC. Mechanistically, TRIM21 directly interacted with and ubiquitinated MST2 at lysine 473 (K473) via K63-linkage. This ubiquitination enabled the formation of MST2 homodimer and enhanced its kinase activity, ultimately resulting in the functional inactivation of yes-associated protein (YAP) and inhibition of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) feature. We identified that vilazodone, an antidepressant, directly bound to TRIM21 to exert effective anti-metastatic action both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these findings revealed a previously unrecognized interplay between TRIM21 and the Hippo-YAP signaling. These results suggested that vilazodone could be repositioned as an anti-tumor drug to inhibit CRC metastasis by targeting TRIM21.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we present an X-ray-visible neural tracer, referred to as DiI-CT, which is based on the well-established lipophilic indocarbocyanine dye DiI, to which we conjugated two iodine atoms. The tracer is visible with microfocus computed tomography (microCT) imaging and shares the excellent fluorescent tracing properties of DiI. We document the discovery potential of DiI-CT by analyzing the vibrissa follicle-sinus complex, a structure where visual access is poor and 3D tissue structure matters and reveal innervation patterns of the intact follicle in unprecedented detail. In the brain, DiI-CT tracing holds promise for verification evaluation of indirect connectivity measures, such as diffusion tensor imaging. We conclude that the bimodal dye DiI-CT opens new avenues for neuroanatomy.

Abstract: Acute lung injury (ALI), a common clinical type of critical illness, is an acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency caused by the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells. In a previous study, we reported a novel lncRNA, lncRNA PFI, which could protect against pulmonary fibrosis in pulmonary fibroblasts. The present study demonstrated that lncRNA PFI was downregulated in alveolar epithelial cell of mice injury lung tissues, and further investigated the role of lncRNA PFI in regulating inflammation-induced alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis. Overexpression of lncRNA PFI could partially abrogated bleomycin induced type II AECs injured. Subsequently, bioinformatic prediction revealed that lncRNA PFI might directly bind to miR-328-3p, and further AGO-2 RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay confirmed their binding relationship. Furthermore, miR-328-3p promoted apoptosis in MLE-12 cells by limiting the activation of the Creb1, a protein correlated with cell apoptosis, whereas AMO-328-3p ablated the pro-apoptosis effect of silencing lncRNA PFI in MLE-12 cells. While miR-328-3p could also ablate the function of lncRNA PFI in bleomycin treated human lung epithelial cells. Enhanced expression of lncRNA PFI reversed the LPS-induced lung injury in mice. Overall, these data reveal that lncRNA PFI mitigated acute lung injury through miR-328-3p/Creb1 pathway in alveolar epithelial cells.

Abstract: Butyrate (BT) is important in the prevention and inhibition of colorectal cancer (CRC). Inflammatory bowel disease, a risk factor for CRC, is associated with higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and bile acids. The aim of this work was to investigate the interaction of these compounds in inhibiting BT uptake by Caco-2 cells, as a mechanism contributing to the link between IBD and CRC. TNF-α, IFN-γ, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) markedly reduce 14C-BT uptake. All these compounds appear to inhibit MCT1-mediated BT cellular uptake at a posttranscriptional level, and, because their effect is not additive, they are most probably inhibiting MCT1 by a similar mechanism. Correspondingly, the antiproliferative effect of BT (MCT1-dependent) and of the proinflammatory cytokines and CDCA were not additive. In contrast, the cytotoxic effect of BT (MCT1-independent) and of the proinflammatory cytokines and CDCA were additive. In conclusion, proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) and bile acids (DCA and CDCA) inhibit MCT1-mediated BT cellular uptake. These proinflammatory cytokines and CDCA were found to interfere with the antiproliferative effect of BT, mediated by an inhibitory effect upon MCT1-mediated cellular uptake of BT.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons. We previously found that inhibition of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) can alleviate dopaminergic neuron degeneration in PD models via regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis, however, the disease-related alterations of VHL and the regulatory mechanisms of VHL level in PD need to be further investigated. In this study, we found that the levels of VHL were markedly increased in multiple cell models of PD and identified microRNA-143-3p (miR-143-3p) as a promising candidate for regulating VHL expression involved in PD. miR-143-3p directly bound to the 3′untranslated region of human VHL mRNA and inhibited its translation, and exerted neuroprotective effects by improving cell viability, apoptosis and tyrosine hydroxylase abnormality. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-143-3p exerted neuroprotection by attenuating mitochondrial abnormality via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) axis, and AMPK inhibitor abolished the beneficial effects of miR-143-3p on the cell model of PD. Therefore, we identify the dysregulated VHL and miR-143-3p in PD, and propose the therapeutic potential of miR-143-3p to alleviate PD by improving mitochondrial homeostasis via AMPK/PGC-1α axis.

Abstract: Summary
A key step in spatial transcriptomics is identifying genes with spatially varying expression patterns. We adopt an information theoretic perspective to this problem by equating the degree of spatial coherence with the Jensen-Shannon divergence between pairs of nearby cells and pairs of distant cells. To avoid the notoriously difficult problem of estimating information theoretic divergences, we use modern approximation techniques to implement a computationally efficient algorithm designed to scale with in situ spatial transcriptomics technologies. In addition to being highly scalable, we show that our method, which we call maximization of spatial information (Maxspin), improves accuracy across several spatial transcriptomics platforms and a variety of simulations when compared with a variety of state-of-the-art methods. To further demonstrate the method, we generated in situ spatial transcriptomics data in a renal cell carcinoma sample using the CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager and used Maxspin to reveal novel spatial patterns of tumor cell gene expression.

Abstract: Cell division cycle associated 5 (CDCA5) is correlated with the development and progression of many malignant tumors. However, little is known about its role in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) progression. In this study, the clinical value, biological function and underlying mechanisms of CDCA5 in EOC were evaluated. CDCA5 mRNA and protein levels were substantially upregulated in EOC and had a significant positive correlation with adverse clinicopathological characteristics and a poor prognosis. CDCA5 facilitated proliferation, invasion, and metastasis and disrupted mitochondrial-mediated endogenous apoptosis by activating the cell cycle pathway and inhibiting the P53 pathway in EOC cells. Conversely, knockdown of CDCA5 expression blocked the malignant activities of EOC cells and suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo. Mechanistically, the transcription factor KLF5 bound to a specific site in the CDCA5 promoter and promoted CDCA5 expression. Moreover, KLF5 overexpression rescued the negative regulation of inhibited CDCA5 expression on EOC cell proliferation. In conclusion, our findings revealed that CDCA5 promoted tumor progression of EOC via the KLF5/CDCA5/cell cycle and P53 axes, which might provide new insights into the roles of CDCA5 in EOC.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic alterations help predict the clinical behavior of diffuse gliomas, but some variability remains uncorrelated. Here, we demonstrate that haploinsufficient deletions of chromatin-bound tumor suppressor NFKB inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA) display distinct patterns of occurrence in relation to other genetic markers and are disproportionately present at recurrence. NFKBIA haploinsufficiency is associated with unfavorable patient outcomes, independent of genetic and clinicopathologic predictors. NFKBIA deletions reshape the DNA and histone methylome antipodal to the IDH mutation and induce a transcriptome landscape partly reminiscent of H3K27M mutant pediatric gliomas. In IDH mutant gliomas, NFKBIA deletions are common in tumors with a clinical course similar to that of IDH wild-type tumors. An externally validated nomogram model for estimating individual patient survival in IDH mutant gliomas confirms that NFKBIA deletions predict comparatively brief survival. Thus, NFKBIA haploinsufficiency aligns with distinct epigenome changes, portends a poor prognosis, and should be incorporated into models predicting the disease fate of diffuse gliomas.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, but its root cause may lie in neurodevelopment. PSEN1 mutations cause the majority of familial AD, potentially by disrupting proper Notch signaling, causing early unnoticed cellular changes that affect later AD progression. While rodent models are useful for modeling later stages of AD, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical spheroids (hCSs) allow access to studying the human cortex at the cellular level over the course of development. Here, we show that the PSEN1 L435F heterozygous mutation affects hCS development, increasing size, increasing progenitors, and decreasing post-mitotic neurons as a result of increased Notch target gene expression during early hCS development. We also show altered Aβ expression and neuronal activity at later hCS stages. These results contrast previous findings, showing how individual PSEN1 mutations may differentially affect neurodevelopment and may give insight into fAD progression to provide earlier time points for more effective treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical neurotransmission occurs at specialized contacts where neurotransmitter release machinery apposes neurotransmitter receptors to underlie circuit function. A series of complex events underlies pre- and postsynaptic protein recruitment to neuronal connections. To better study synaptic development in individual neurons, we need cell-type-specific strategies to visualize endogenous synaptic proteins. Although presynaptic strategies exist, postsynaptic proteins remain less studied because of a paucity of cell-type-specific reagents. To study excitatory postsynapses with cell-type specificity, we engineered dlg1[4K], a conditionally labeled marker of Drosophila excitatory postsynaptic densities. With binary expression systems, dlg1[4K] labels central and peripheral postsynapses in larvae and adults. Using dlg1[4K], we find that distinct rules govern postsynaptic organization in adult neurons, multiple binary expression systems can concurrently label pre- and postsynapse in a cell-type-specific manner, and neuronal DLG1 can sometimes localize presynaptically. These results validate our strategy for conditional postsynaptic labeling and demonstrate principles of synaptic organization.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily infects the respiratory tract, but pulmonary and cardiac complications occur in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To elucidate molecular mechanisms in the lung and heart, we conducted paired experiments in human stem cell-derived lung alveolar type II (AT2) epithelial cell and cardiac cultures infected with SARS-CoV-2. With CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of ACE2, we demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of both cell types but that further processing in lung cells required TMPRSS2, while cardiac cells required the endosomal pathway. Host responses were significantly different; transcriptome profiling and phosphoproteomics responses depended strongly on the cell type. We identified several antiviral compounds with distinct antiviral and toxicity profiles in lung AT2 and cardiac cells, highlighting the importance of using several relevant cell types for evaluation of antiviral drugs. Our data provide new insights into rational drug combinations for effective treatment of a virus that affects multiple organ systems.

Abstract: Summary
Current methods to generate human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be inefficient, and it is challenging to generate sufficient hPGCLCs to optimize in vitro gametogenesis. We present a differentiation method that uses diluted basement membrane extract (BMEx) and low BMP4 concentration to efficiently induce hPGCLC differentiation in scalable 2D cell culture. We show that BMEx overlay potentiated BMP/SMAD signaling, induced lumenogenesis, and increased expression of key hPGCLC-progenitor markers such as TFAP2A and EOMES. hPGCLCs that were generated using the BMEx overlay method were able to upregulate more mature germ cell markers, such as DAZL and DDX4, in human fetal ovary reconstitution culture. These findings highlight the importance of BMEx during hPGCLC differentiation and demonstrate the potential of the BMEx overlay method to interrogate the formation of PGCs and amnion in humans, as well as to investigate the next steps to achieve in vitro gametogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria can evolve to withstand a wide range of antibiotics (ABs) by using various resistance mechanisms. How ABs affect the ecology of the gut microbiome is still poorly understood. We investigated strain-specific responses and evolution during repeated AB perturbations by three clinically relevant ABs, using gnotobiotic mice colonized with a synthetic bacterial community (oligo-mouse-microbiota). Over 80 days, we observed resilience effects at the strain and community levels, and we found that they were correlated with modulations of the estimated growth rate and levels of prophage induction as determined from metagenomics data. Moreover, we tracked mutational changes in the bacterial populations, and this uncovered clonal expansion and contraction of haplotypes and selection of putative AB resistance-conferring SNPs. We functionally verified these mutations via reisolation of clones with increased minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline from evolved communities. This demonstrates that host-associated microbial communities employ various mechanisms to respond to selective pressures that maintain community stability.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the specificities of human serum antibodies that broadly neutralize HIV can inform prevention and treatment strategies. Here, we describe a deep mutational scanning system that can measure the effects of combinations of mutations to HIV envelope (Env) on neutralization by antibodies and polyclonal serum. We first show that this system can accurately map how all functionally tolerated mutations to Env affect neutralization by monoclonal antibodies. We then comprehensively map Env mutations that affect neutralization by a set of human polyclonal sera that neutralize diverse strains of HIV and target the site engaging the host receptor CD4. The neutralizing activities of these sera target different epitopes, with most sera having specificities reminiscent of individual characterized monoclonal antibodies, but one serum targeting two epitopes within the CD4-binding site. Mapping the specificity of the neutralizing activity in polyclonal human serum will aid in assessing anti-HIV immune responses to inform prevention strategies.

Abstract: Summary
RNA A-to-I editing is a post-transcriptional modification pervasively occurring in cells. Artificial intervention of A-to-I editing at specific sites of RNA could also be achieved with guide RNA and exogenous ADAR enzymes. In contrast to previous fused SNAP-ADAR enzymes for light-driven RNA A-to-I editing, we developed photo-caged antisense guide RNA oligonucleotides with simple 3′-terminal cholesterol modification, and successfully achieved light-triggered site-specific RNA A-to-I editing for the first time utilizing endogenous ADAR enzymes. Our caged A-to-I editing system effectively implemented light-dependent point mutation of mRNA transcripts of both exogenous and endogenous genes in living cells and 3D tumorspheres, as well as spatial regulation of EGFP expression, which provides a new approach for precise manipulation of RNA editing.

Abstract: Summary
Lung cancer in never-smokers (LCINS) presents clinicopathological and molecular features distinct from that in smokers. Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays important roles in cancer progression and therapeutic response. To decipher the difference in TME between never-smoker and smoker lung cancers, we conduct single-cell RNA sequencing on 165,753 cells from 22 treatment-naive lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. We find that the dysfunction of alveolar cells induced by cigarette smoking contributes more to the aggressiveness of smoker LUADs, while the immunosuppressive microenvironment exerts more effects on never-smoker LUADs’ aggressiveness. Moreover, the SPP1hi pro macrophage is identified to be another independent source of monocyte-derived macrophage. Importantly, higher expression of immune checkpoint CD47 and lower expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I in cancer cells of never-smoker LUADs imply that CD47 may be a better immunotherapy target for LCINS. Therefore, this study reveals the difference of tumorigenesis between never-smoker and smoker LUADs and provides a potential immunotherapy strategy for LCINS.

Abstract: Summary
Internalization of pathogenic bacteria by macrophages results in formation of antibiotic-tolerant persisters. These cells are maintained in a non-growing state for extended periods of time, and it is assumed that their growth resumption causes infection relapse after cessation of antibiotic treatment. Despite this clinical relevance, the signals and conditions that drive persister regrowth during infection are not yet understood. Here, we found that after persister formation in macrophages, host reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced in response to Salmonella infection lock persisters in growth arrest by intoxicating their TCA cycle, lowering cellular respiration and ATP production. Intracellular persisters resume growth when macrophage RNS production subsides and functionality of their TCA cycle is regained. Persister growth resumption within macrophages is slow and heterogeneous, dramatically extending the time the persister reservoir feeds infection relapse. Using an inhibitor of RNS production, we can force recalcitrant bacteria to regrow during antibiotic treatment, thereby facilitating their eradication.

Abstract: Summary
Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are used in a wide array of experimental situations for driving expression of biosensors, recombinases, and opto-/chemo-genetic actuators in the brain. However, conventional approaches for minimally invasive, spatially precise, and ultra-sparse AAV-mediated transduction of cells during imaging experiments have remained a significant challenge. Here, we show that intravenous injection of commercially available AAVs at different doses, combined with laser-based perforation of cortical capillaries through a cranial widow, allows for ultra-sparse, titratable, and micron-level precision for delivery of viral vectors with relatively little inflammation or tissue damage. Further, we show the utility of this approach for eliciting sparse expression of GCaMP6, channelrhodopsin, or fluorescent reporters in neurons and astrocytes within specific functional domains in normal and stroke-damaged cortex. This technique represents a facile approach for targeted delivery of viral vectors that should assist in the study of cell types and circuits in the cortex.

Abstract: Summary
The cGAS-STING pathway has long been recognized as playing a crucial role in immune surveillance and tumor suppression. Here, we show that when the pathway is activated in a cancer-cell-autonomous response manner, it confers drug resistance. Targeted or conventional chemotherapy drugs promoted cytosolic DNA accumulation in cancer cells, activating the cGAS-STING pathway and downstream TBK1-IRF3/NF-κB signaling. This cancer cell-intrinsic response enabled the cells to counteract drug stress, allowing treatment resistance to be acquired and maintained. Blockade of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling delayed and overcame resistance in models in vitro and in vivo. This finding uncovers an alternative face of cGAS-STING signaling other than the well-reported modulation of microenvironmental immune cells. It also implies a caution for the combination of STING agonist with targeted or conventional chemotherapy drug treatment, a strategy prevailing in current clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are an emerging technology for therapeutic intervention, but options to target cell surface proteins and receptors remain limited. Here we introduce ROTACs, bispecific WNT- and BMP-signaling-disabled R-spondin (RSPO) chimeras, which leverage the specificity of these stem cell growth factors for ZNRF3/RNF43 E3 transmembrane ligases, to target degradation of transmembrane proteins. As a proof-of-concept, we targeted the immune checkpoint protein, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a prominent cancer therapeutic target, with a bispecific RSPO2 chimera, R2PD1. The R2PD1 chimeric protein binds to PD-L1 and at picomolar concentration induces its lysosomal degradation. In three melanoma cell lines, R2PD1 induced between 50 and 90% PD-L1 protein degradation. PD-L1 degradation was strictly dependent on ZNRF3/RNF43. Moreover, R2PD1 reactivates cytotoxic T cells and inhibits tumor cell proliferation more potently than Atezolizumab. We suggest that signaling-disabled ROTACs represent a paradigm to target cell surface proteins for degradation in a range of applications.

Abstract: Summary
Glycosylation of eukaryotic virus particles is common and influences their uptake, trafficking, and immune recognition. In contrast, glycosylation of bacteriophage particles has not been reported; phage virions typically do not enter the cytoplasm upon infection, and they do not generally inhabit eukaryotic systems. We show here that several genomically distinct phages of Mycobacteria are modified with glycans attached to the C terminus of capsid and tail tube protein subunits. These O-linked glycans influence antibody production and recognition, shielding viral particles from antibody binding and reducing production of neutralizing antibodies. Glycosylation is mediated by phage-encoded glycosyltransferases, and genomic analysis suggests that they are relatively common among mycobacteriophages. Putative glycosyltransferases are also encoded by some Gordonia and Streptomyces phages, but there is little evidence of glycosylation among the broader phage population. The immune response to glycosylated phage virions in mice suggests that glycosylation may be an advantageous property for phage therapy of Mycobacterium infections.

Abstract: Regardless of significant advances in cancer treatment, gastric cancer (GC) incidence rate is increasing worldwide. As one of the main transcription factors participating in stemness, Nanog plays a pivotal role in various aspects of tumorigenesis, metastasis, and chemosensitivity. Given that, the current research intended to evaluate the potential effects of Nanog suppression on the GC cell Cisplatin chemosensitivity and in vitro tumorigenesis. First, bioinformatics analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of Nanog expression on GC patients' survival. The MKN-45 human GC cells were transfected with specific siRNA targeting Nanog and/or treated with Cisplatin. Then, to study cellular viability and apoptosis, MTT assay and Annexin V/PI staining were done, respectively. Also, the scratch assay was performed to investigate cell migration, and MKN-45 cell stemness was followed using colony formation assay. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were used for gene expression analysis. The findings demonstrated that Nanog overexpression was significantly correlated with poor survival of GC patients, and siRNA-mediated Nanog silencing strongly increased MKN-45 cell sensitivity to Cisplatin through apoptosis induction. Also, Nanog suppression combined with Cisplatin resulted in the upregulation of the Caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio at mRNA levels and increased Caspase-3 activation. Moreover, reduced expression of Nanog, separately or combined with Cisplatin, inhibited MKN-45 cell migration by downregulating MMP2 mRNA and protein expression levels. The results also evidenced CD44 and SOX-2 downregulation aligned with a decreased rate of MKN-45 cell colony formation ability through treatments. Besides, Nanog downregulation significantly decreased MDR-1 mRNA expression. Taken together, the results of this study indicated that Nanog could be suggested as a promising target combined with Cisplatin-based GC therapies for reducing drug side effects and improving patients’ outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS) is an oncogene that is deregulated and highly mutated in cancers including melanomas and acute myeloid leukemias. The 5′ untranslated region (UTR) (5′ UTR) of the NRAS mRNA contains a G-quadruplex (G4) that regulates translation. Here we report a novel class of small molecule that binds to the G4 structure located in the 5′ UTR of the NRAS mRNA. We used a small molecule microarray screen to identify molecules that selectively bind to the NRAS-G4 with submicromolar affinity. One compound inhibits the translation of NRAS in vitro but showed only moderate effects on the NRAS levels in cellulo. Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends and RT-PCR analysis revealed that the predominant NRAS transcript does not possess the G4 structure. Thus, although NRAS transcripts lack a G4 in many cell lines the concept of targeting folded regions within 5′ UTRs to control translation remains a highly attractive strategy.

Abstract: Primary cilia (PCs) that are present in most human cells and perform sensory function or signal transduction are lost in many solid tumors. Previously, we identified VDAC1, best known to regulate mitochondrial bioenergetics, to negatively regulate ciliogenesis. Here, we show that downregulation of VDAC1 in pancreatic cancer-derived Panc1 and glioblastoma-derived U-87MG cells significantly increased ciliation. Those PCs were significantly longer than the control cells. Such increased ciliation possibly inhibited cell cycle, which contributed to reduced proliferation of these cells. VDAC1-depletion also led to longer PCs in quiescent RPE1 cells. Therefore, serum-induced PC disassembly was slower in VDAC1-depleted RPE1 cells. Overall, this study reiterates the importance of VDAC1 in modulating tumorigenesis, due to its novel role in regulating PC disassembly and cilia length.
