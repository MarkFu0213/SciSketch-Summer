Abstract: It is imperative to recover lead (Pb) contained in end-of-life solar modules. In this paper, a two-step leaching and electrowinning process using acetic acid is investigated for Pb recovery. Acetic acid with hydrogen peroxide can dissolve Pb quickly and, under some conditions, in a matter of minutes. Pb electrowinning has been successfully demonstrated from aqueous solutions of 0.009 M lead(II) acetate with 0–10% v/v acetic acid. Pb-containing deposits are found on both the copper cathode and graphite anode. X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirm the presence of metallic Pb and Pb(II) oxide (PbO) co-deposits on the cathode. There is also the formation of lead subacetate on the cathode under certain conditions. On the anode, the deposit consists of lead(IV) oxide and superoxide (PbO2 and Pb1–xO2). A Pb recovery rate of 99% is achieved in 0.009 M lead(II) acetate solutions with 10% v/v acetic acid by applying a reduction potential of either –0.8 V or –1.0 V versus the silver/silver chloride reference electrode for 24 h. Pb leaching with acetic acid is also demonstrated from milled silicon solar modules.

Abstract: Solving the problem of ice accumulation on solid surfaces is of great importance to industrial production and human life. At present, the design of most anti-icing materials faces the problems of high cost, complex preparation, environmental pollution and energy consumption. In this work, we propose a rapid and simple preparation method for anti-icing/deicing coatings. A photothermal superhydrophobic coating was quickly prepared by a two-step deposition method using Fe3O4@PDMS mixed liquor, in which Fe3O4 particles not only have excellent photothermal conversion property, but also can impart the coating surface with micro-nanoscale rough structure, PDMS is used as a binder to enhance the durability of the coating while providing low surface energy. The results reveal that the surface temperature of the coating can rise to 85 °C in 10 min under simulated sunlight irradiation and melt the frozen droplets in 270 s. The prepared coating also shows excellent superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 160° and is able to delay icing time up to 660 s. In addition, the coating has excellent self-cleaning, anti-fouling and mechanical durability properties. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity can be quickly restored by a simple simulated sunlight treatment even if the surface of the coating is impacted by water. Therefore, this multifunctional anti-icing/deicing coating with simple preparation and low cost has a broad application prospect.

Abstract: Nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER) is an essential mechanism for single-strand breaks (SSB) repair while xeroderma pigmentosum family (XPA to XPG) is the most important system to NER. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous hematological cancer characterized by cytopenias and risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation. MDS pathogenesis has been associated with problems of DNA repair system. This report aimed to evaluate NER polymorphisms (XPA rs1800975, XPC rs2228000, XPD rs1799793 and XPF rs1800067) in 269 MDS patients of different populations in Latin America (173 Brazilian and 96 Argentinean). Genotypes were identified in DNA samples by RT-qPCR using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. Regarding rs1799793 polymorphism of XPD for Brazilian population, the heterozygous genotype AG presented a high odds ratio (OR) to have a normal karyotype (p = 0.012, OR=3.000) and the mutant homozygous genotype AA was associated to a high OR of AML transformation (p = 0.034, OR=7.4). In Argentine population, the homozygous mutant AA genotype of rs1800975 polymorphism of XPA was associated with an increased odd to have hemoglobin levels below 8g/dL (p = 0.013, OR=10.000) while for the rs1799793 polymorphism of XPD, the heterozygous AG genotype decreased OR to be classified as good (p < 0.001, OR=9.05 × 10−10), and intermediate (p < 0.001, OR=3.08 × 10−10), according to Revised-International Prognostic Scoring System. Regarding the rs1800067 polymorphisms of XPF, the homozygous mutant AA genotype showed a decreased OR to be classified as good (p < 0.001, OR=4.03 × 10−13) and intermediate (p < 0.001, OR=2.54 × 10−13). Our report reinforces the heterogeneity of MDS and demonstrates the importance of ethnic differences and regional influences in pathogenesis and prognosis of MDS.

Abstract: Desalination based on solar-driven interfacial steam generation has emerged as an efficient and cost-effective solution to the freshwater crisis. However, an alternative approach needs to adopt to alleviate the freshwater crisis and environmental pollution simultaneously. The widespread use of surgical face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic introduces a new environmental concern related to face mask disposal. Herein, a solar evaporator is fabricated by coating novel TiTe2 quantum dots (QDs) decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on a hydrophilic substrate derived from waste face mask to desalinate seawater with an evaporation rate and efficiency of 2.09 kg m−2 h−1 and 87.79% respectively. The presence of rGO contributes to absorb a wide range of the solar spectrum, while the quantum confinement effect of QDs confines heat at the nanoscale. The use of heat sink and extended polyurethane foam (EPE) improve heat localization by minimizing heat loss. The freshwater generated by solar evaporation satisfies the WHO drinking water standard. As a result, the proposed design may reduce environmental pollutants by recycling the waste facemask while producing freshwater using only incident solar irradiation, establishing a waste-water nexus with large-scale deployment potential.

Abstract: In recent years, high-performance polymers (HPPs) have received much attention for their excellent electrochromic (EC) properties and applications in optoelectronic research. Herein, a series of novel poly(arylamine sulfone) (PAAS) and poly(arylamine ketone) (PAAK) type HPP electrochromic films have been prepared directly on the Indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates by electrochemical polymerization. Notably, the triphenylamine-based polymers (P-TST and P-TKT) have higher optical contrast (capable of exceeding 40%), shorter switching times (coloring time tc and bleaching time tb can be as low as 1 s), and better cycling stability (optical contrast remains around 80% after a cycling test of 500 s) than the carbazole-based polymers (P-CSC and P-CKC). Performance aside, this work provides a simple, rapid, and efficient method to synthesize polyarylsulfone/ketone-based electrochromic materials for the first time. With this method, the cost is significantly reduced, production efficiency is accelerated, and the problem of difficult film formation due to poor solubility after conventional polymerization is solved, providing a feasible solution for subsequent large-scale production and practical applications.

Abstract: Although surgery is an important treatment for laryngeal cancer, surgery has a significant negative impact on the quality of life of patients, and many patients have poor tolerance to surgery. Therefore, alternative chemotherapeutic drugs are an important research hotspot. Chidamide is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the expression of type I and IIb histone deacetylases (1, 2, 3 and 10). It has a significant anticancer effect on a variety of solid tumours. This study verified the inhibitory effect of chidamide on laryngeal carcinoma. We conducted a variety of cellular and animal experiments to explore how chidamide inhibits the development of laryngeal cancer. The results showed that chidamide had significant antitumour activity against laryngeal carcinoma cells and xenografts and could induce cell apoptosis, ferroptosis and pyroptosis. This study provides a potential option for the treatment of laryngeal cancer.

Abstract: Gallium-doped zinc oxide (GZO) thin films under different oxygen flows were deposited by low-damage reactive plasma deposition (RPD) technology and their crystal structures, optical and electrical properties were investigated. We find all the GZO films have good crystallinity with (002) preferred orientation and the crystallinity of GZO films increases with the oxygen flow. In addition, the mobility of the GZO film reaches 10.6 cm2/V·s and the resistivity were minimized to 6.24 × 10−4 Ω cm at 10 sccm oxygen flow. Moreover, the GZO film has an average transmittance of 85.35% in the wavelength range of 390–780 nm at 60 sccm oxygen flow. Finally, the SHJ solar cells based on GZO films at front side or rear side were prepared respectively and the optimized efficiency of 23.65% was achieved for SHJ solar cells when the GZO film was deposited on the rear electrode of the cells. To our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency for GZO-based SHJ solar cells currently, which apparently demonstrates that the low-cost ZnO based material is promising for the mass production of SHJ solar cells.

Abstract: Electrochromic smart windows provide an important route to reduce building energy consumption by dynamically adjusting the transmission of visible and near-infrared light. However, the requirement for an external electrical supply greatly limits their application in energy-saving buildings. Herein, we develop a novel photovoltaic (PV) cell-powered electrochromic energy storage smart window prototype by the combination of nickel-cobalt bimetal oxide electrochromic window and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cell, which not only realizes the function integration of self-power and intelligent solar radiation regulation, but also extends its function to energy storage. Specifically, the obtained NiCoO2 electrochromic films display a large optical modulation (60.0% at 550 nm), fast switching time (7.6/11.4 s), outstanding stability and excellent rate capability. Based on the achieved NiCoO2 film and TiO2 film, high-performance electrochromic energy storage smart windows (EESW) were further assembled and demonstrated excellent compatibility with CZTSSe solar cell. Benefiting from the unique merits of CZTSSe cell, the self-powered EESW exhibits excellent optical modulation (56.0% at 550 nm) and fast coloration speed (17 s). Moreover, the self-powered EESW can serve as a power source to drive external electronics. Our exploration of multi-functional smart windows offers an effective strategy to realize a highly efficient low-energy building in the future.

Abstract: The present study has investigated two effective routes to improve the response time and the detection range for the n-MoS2/p-CuO (conventional p-n) heterojunction. In the first rectification, an insulating AlN layer was inserted between the MoS2 and CuO layer, which leads the traditional p-n junction to Semiconductor-Insulator-Semiconductor (SIS) with a superior carrier tunneling mechanism. Interestingly, the fabricated heterostructure exhibits self-powered and broad-range photoresponse. The response time (rise time and fall time) of the fabricated n-MoS2/p-CuO heterojunction decreases from 93.35 ms to 102.68 ms–11.31 ms and 12.73 ms with the insertion of ultrathin insulating AlN Layer. The higher responsivity and ultrafast photoresponse in n-MoS2/AlN/p-CuO (SIS) heterojunction can be ascribed to the carrier tunneling mechanism through the ultrathin-insulating AlN layer. In the second rectification, the detection range can be enhanced up to the UV region by adding a layer of MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) on the surface of the MoS2 layer. The fabricated n-MoS2 QDs/n-MoS2/AlN/p-CuO heterostructure shows photoresponse in a broad range from UV to NIR radiations. The obtained results demonstrate the n-MoS2/AlN/p-CuO (SIS) heterostructure with the addition of MoS2 QDs shows excellent potential for next-generation ultrafast optoelectronics applications.

Abstract: Polysilicon (poly-Si)-on-oxide passivating contact structures (POLO/TOPCon) enable high-efficiency solar cells as they simultaneously provide a very high level of surface passivation and a high conductance for either electrons or holes. The ease of incorporation with existing manufacturing lines and their tolerance for high-temperature processing has increased the wide acceptance of this structure in the PV industry. In this report, we explore the effects of short high-temperature annealing required for effective hydrogenation and formation of ohmic screen-printed contacts across a wide temperature range (636 °C–846 °C) on the stability of passivating contact structures. We study this on p-type c-Si substrates with phosphorus-doped (n-type) or boron-doped (p-type) polysilicon contacts capped with either an AlOx or SiNx coating. Our experimental results show that irrespective of the poly-Si doping type, AlOx-capped samples suffer a loss in surface passivation across the investigated temperature range, while SiNx-capped samples show an improvement at lower annealing temperatures. Above 744 °C, severely ruptured blisters occur for the samples coated with a SiNx layer, leading to lift-off of the poly layer in extreme cases, and in all cases, significant surface passivation losses, up to 99%. A study of the long-term stability of these fired samples under 1-sun illumination @ 140 °C shows that they suffer from both bulk and surface-like instabilities. Two degradation cycles were observed: the first, a boron-oxygen light-induced degradation (BO-LID) observed after 5 min, with capture cross-section ratios of 15.8–19.2, and a slower secondary degradation, similar to light and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID), with maximum degradation reached after ∼ 14 days. The presence of a silicon nitride layer does not appear to influence the kinetics of post-degradation recovery. Our results suggest that the effect of firing may be influenced by the polarity of the bulk c-Si or perhaps the chemistry of the SiNx film and highlight that passivating contact structures based on p-type c-Si may offer better long-term stability than those based on n-type c-Si.

Abstract: In this paper the influence of composition variations during the growth of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) layers on defect concentrations and final absorber properties is analyzed. The samples are prepared from sputtered metallic and alloyed Zn/Cu–Sn/(Sn)/Zn precursors. The variation of sputtered Sn content facilitates different forms for the embedded Sn (Cu3Sn, Cu6Sn5, elemental Sn). The predominating formation reaction during the subsequent annealing is tuned by the ratio of the alloys and the overall chemical composition in the precursor. During the high temperature stage of CZTSe formation the layer undergoes an in-process composition shift (Sn content variation), after which the final absorber composition is reached. As all absorbers are reaching a comparable end composition, in this paper the influence of the different precursor compositions and corresponding reaction pathways on the resulting defects and optoelectronic properties of the absorbers are addressed. Spectroscopic investigations were used to extract the defect configuration of the absorbers. The results are complemented with device performance measurements. Preferable precursor compositions leading to lower defect concentration and improved photoluminescence quantum-yield is identified. The obtained Urbach energy and VOC deficit are among the most promising results measured in our laboratories.

Abstract: Polycrystalline silicon-based (poly-Si) passivating contacts are a promising technology for the next generation of high-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells. Ex-situ doping via spin-on-dopant solutions is a potential method to fabricate patterned poly-Si contacts, like those used in interdigitated back contact architectures. This study compares the performance of phosphorous doped poly-Si passivating contacts fabricated from different industry-compatible intrinsic silicon films and a spin-on-dopant process. We explore the influence of the grain size on the electrical quality of the poly-Si films and find a correlation between larger grain size and lower contact recombination and resistivity. The best results are achieved with low-pressure chemical vapor deposited poly-Si films, reaching an implied open circuit voltage iVoc of 730 mV, followed by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited films with an iVoc of 700 mV. Both films also produced low contact resistivities of <50 mΩ-cm2. For the case of physical vapor deposition (sputtered) poly-Si films, which are found to have the smallest crystalline features, a low iVoc of 625 mV was measured, attributed to a low active dopant concentration within the poly-Si film. This study informs researchers looking to use spin-on-dopants in terms of the poly-Si layer deposition method and the optimal temperature profiles for the process.

Abstract: Molten salt as heat transfer and storage media is widely studied. In order to meet the high-temperature need such as ultra-supercritical steam power cycle, low-cost sodium nitrate/carbonate mixed molten salt are developed and prepared, thermophysical characteristics of three different samples are investigated in this work. The minimum values of melting point and initial crystal temperature of sodium nitrate/carbonate mixed molten salt are 300.7 °C (No. 3 sample) and 281.7 °C (No. 2 sample). The decomposition temperature increases with the increasing mass ratio of sodium carbonate in mixed molten salt. The maximum decomposition temperature of sodium nitrate/carbonate mixed salt is 639 °C (No. 3 sample). The highest average values of specific heat and thermal conductivity of No. 1 sample are 1.56 J/(g K) and 0.79 W/(m K), respectively. The viscosity of tested mixed molten salt increases with the increasing of mass ratio of sodium carbonate. The specific heat, thermal conductivity and viscosity equations of sodium nitrate/carbonate mixed salts are fitted. Meanwhile, the sensible thermal energy storage cost of No. 1 sample is 51.22% less than that of Solar salt. The No.1 molten salt has excellent thermal shock resistance performance, which has good application value in large-scale high temperature thermal energy storage system.

Abstract: Carbonate eutectic salt is a kind of promising phase change material (PCM) for high temperature thermal storage application, which unfortunately constrained by its significant corrosiveness and low thermal conductivity. The encapsulation of salt PCM with stable inorganic shell to make capsules of millimeter to centimeter size can solve these problems, which is unfortunately technologically difficult to be prepared. In this work, a double shell strategy was proposed to coat the salt macrospheres with inner expanded graphite (EG) layer and outer ceramic kaolin layer. All raw materials were powders, which were shaped to spheres and capsules with the help of organic binder, pressed by isostatic pressing and finally sintered at high temperature for capsule formation. In a comparative case, the single kaolin shell coated capsules leaked when they were heated over the melting point of salt since that the relatively porous kaolin shell could be infiltrated with liquid salt because of their good wettability. However, the double shells coated capsules could prevent the leakage of salt since that the inner EG layer was repellent to liquid salt. The double shells coated macrocapsules showed good stability and high durability for long-term use, as confirmed by a cycling test over 300 cycles. The eutectic salt (Na2CO3/Li2CO3 = 57/43 in weight) core PCM presented a high latent heat of 313 J/g and melting point of around 498 °C. The macrocapsules with a size of 10@1.5@3 showed a high heat storage capability of 380 J/g in a temperature range of 400–600 °C. The macroencapulated carbonate eutectic salt with good heat storage capability and good thermal cycling durability can be extensively used for high-temperature heat storage applications in solar thermal power plant and industrial waste heat recovery.

Abstract: MgCl2-KCl-NaCl molten chloride salt is a promising candidate for thermal energy storage medium and heat transfer fluid for next-generation Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants (Gen-3 CSP). The main challenge has yet been the selection of economical yet corrosion-resistant structural materials to be used. Previous work by the authors has demonstrated that simple corrosion control strategies can mitigate corrosion effects, thereby allowing the use of classical stainless steels as structural materials in the hot part (e.g., ≥700 °C) of the CSP system. This study addresses the selection of cold tank materials, which have to withstand corrosion effects up to temperatures of 500 °C. Two cost-effective commercial types of steels, P91 and SS 304, were examined as candidates for structural materials, and controlled corrosion experiments were performed in molten MgCl2-KCl-NaCl salt at 500 °C for 1400 h. Before the exposure tests, the chloride salt was purified using a simple yet effective Mg-doping technique. The results show that the corrosion rates (CRs) of P91 samples are consistently low (<15 μm/year) for both macroscopic and microscopic analysis. The cheaper P91 steel outperforms the more expensive SS 304 in terms of corrosion resistance and also may prove to be beneficial in terms of mechanical properties and economics. Overall, the use of P91 as a cold tank structural material allows for significant cost reduction of the cold tank for chloride-TES system and enhances its competitiveness compared with commercial nitrate-TES.

Abstract: Achieving efficient and low-cost preparation of high-temperature phase change materials (HTPCMs) is of great significance to the sustainable development of thermal energy storage (TES) systems. This study reports the successful fabrication of core-shell structure macro capsules using copper slag partial replacement of bauxite in the shell raw material. The commercial solid Al ball was in situ encapsulated by a double-layer ceramic shell with the cavity between the core and the inner shell using a two-step granulating method and heat treatment. Surprisingly, the macro capsules with the addition of copper slag in the shell material showed excellent thermal cycle stability and durability at the drastic melting-solidification cycling test up to 500 cycles even under air atmosphere. The addition of copper slag to the shell material of HTPCMs effectively improves the sensible heat storage capacity, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. This can be attributed to the formation of Fe2O3 in the outer layer shell. This research provides a novel idea for the high-value utilization of copper slag to produce HTPCMs and realize the recycling of solid waste resources.

Abstract: By using photovoltaic cells under high-intensity laser illumination, much higher photoconversion efficiencies are obtained than under the solar spectrum. We demonstrate a monocrystalline Si based minimodule to convert laser light into electricity using edge-illuminated Si “minicells” based on polysilicon on silicon oxide passivating contacts. Ten fully metallized devices were stacked in series and illuminated from the edge, creating a high-voltage, low-current minimodule that mitigates resistive and Auger-Meitner losses. The minimodule shows a high open-circuit voltage of >5 V when tested under 1-Sun illumination and >7 V at higher illumination intensities when tested with a flash simulator. The fill factor in these minimodules is limited by shunting at low illuminations but reaches a maximum of ∼78% for higher illumination intensities >40 Suns (current density >1200 mA/cm2), indicating that the minimodules are not limited by series resistance up to 40 Suns. Under 1000 nm monochromatic light, we measure efficiencies >40% at > 40 Suns equivalent illumination, showing the potential of passivated contact Si cells for laser power conversion.

Abstract: Introduction
The perception of prejudice against, and stigmatization of, sickle cell disease (SCD) leads the patient to perceive a different treatment, due to the disease stigma and may be related to a worse quality of life (QoL).
Objectives
Describe and evaluate the perception of the prejudice against the disease and its impact on the quality of life of patients with sickle cell disease.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study conducted between March 2019 and February 2020, with patients diagnosed with SCD. Patients were questioned about the perception of prejudice in any kind of situation, choosing between “Yes” or “No”, not differentiating situations related to prejudice. To assess the QoL and impact of the disease, the volunteers answered a version of the SF-36 questionnaire translated and validated into Brazilian Portuguese.
Results
In this study, 113 patients with SCD were followed up, 92% were classified as HbSS and the rest, divided between HbSC and HbS-β-0. Regarding the SF-36, the worst scores were in the summary of the physical components (mean 48.19 ± 21.51) and the physical aspect had the lowest mean (30.75 ±€42.65). When questioned if they had already perceived any kind of prejudice, including the SCD, 32.74% answered “Yes”. For this comparison, there was a significant difference in the summary of the physical and mental components, with worse QoL for those who had already suffered prejudice.
Conclusion
Patients diagnosed with SCD who reported perception of prejudice had statistically significant worse QoL, revealing the negative impact, that might lead to sadness and social isolation.

Abstract: Photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) converter is a solid-state heat engine, in which hot electrons emit from a p-type semiconductor cathode to an anode across a vacuum gap. Photon-enhanced mechanism reflects in reducing the electron emission barrier by photo-induced quasi-Fermi level splitting. High photon-enhancement mode requires a thin cathode thickness to reduce the recombination of excited-electron during diffusion. Whereas, thin cathode causes huge photon penetration loss. In this work, we propose an original concept of hybrid photon-enhanced thermionic emission converter and photovoltaic (PETE-PV) solar cell. The penetrating solar photons are utilized by photovoltaic sub-devices to yield additional output power. The operating characteristics and superiority of a four-terminal PETE-PV solar cell were demonstrated by simulation. Results show that the solar cell gains a 4–8% point of power conversion efficiency boost thanks to the photovoltaic sub-device. In addition, we developed a PETE prototype with light impinging through a transparent anode (i.e., indium-tin-oxide film) to a cathode surface. Experimental results demonstrate that the cathode saturation current under illumination is ∼300-fold larger than that of pure thermionic emission mode, and the cathode work function is reduced by 0.6 eV. This study lays a solid foundation for further development and application of PETE-PV solar cells.

Abstract: Texturing additives have been widely used in the manufacture of monocrystalline silicon solar cells to form a uniform and dense pyramid structure on the silicon surface. However, the texturing mechanism of additives on the silicon surface is still unclear, especially the effect on the anisotropy of different silicon planes when corroded in alkaline solution. Here, we introduced two sulphonates of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and sodium methylene naphthalene sulfonate (NNO) as texturing additive, respectively, which assists the formation of a uniform and dense pyramid structure on the silicon surface. In the light of theoretical calculations, it is found that sulfonate group is easier to adsorb on the (100) and (111) crystal planes of monocrystalline silicon than hydroxide group, so that sulfonate groups can protect the formed pyramid structure and reduce the etching rate. In addition, we also study the texture effect of NNO, and find that when the concentration of NNO is 20 ppm, the surface passivation effect of silicon wafer is the best, and the average efficiency of the corresponding monocrystalline silicon Selective Emitter Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact (SE-PERC) solar cells reaches 23.17%. This texture system containing NNO, whose core is sulfonate group, has an excellent application prospect in the manufacture of monocrystalline silicon SE-PERC solar cells.

Abstract: ：Based on the study of traditional lead-based glass frit systems, in this work, melt-quenching method was used to prepare a type of rare metal oxide-doped glass frit. The influence of the composition of glass frit on the softening temperature of the glass frit, the cross-sectional structure, the surface morphology of the front electrode grid line of the solar cell, the contact interface structure, and the electrical properties of the solar cell were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), High stage microscope (HSM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). The results indicated that the characteristic temperature points of the glass frits doped with metal oxides were superior to those of traditional glass frits. In addition, the glass frits doped with both metal oxides could be completely melted at approximately 626 °C. When glass frits were introduced into the grid line of the front electrode for a solar cell, the silver powder could dissolve and etch the anti-reflection film, forming a thin glass layer containing a large number of silver crystals and an Ag–Pb eutectic alloy at the Ag–Si contact interface. This provided an effective approach for electronic transmission, thereby promoting the formation of good ohmic contact. Consequently, compared with the solar cells made of traditional glass frit, the monocrystalline silicon solar cells composed of glass frit doped with rare metal oxides had a lower series resistance value (2.41 mΩ) and higher photoelectric conversion efficiency (22.62%).

Abstract: Monolithic perovskite silicon tandem solar cells promise high efficiency and cost advantage. In such tandem devices a conductive front electrode of high transparency is necessary for lateral transportation of the charges. This study focuses on optimizing the electro-optical properties of DC sputtered ITO films as front electrode in monolithic two-terminal perovskite silicon tandem solar cells. Initially, an ITO thin film is developed by finding a possible optimum doping level that provides both high transparency and low sheet resistance. Moreover, to further decouple the transparency-conductivity trade-off of the ITO bulk properties from the requirements for low-ohmic contact formation, a thin, highly doped ITO interlayer is inserted towards the SnOX interface. The ITO thin film (stack) significantly improved efficiency of the tandem solar cells by improving all solar cell parameters. This optimization led to improved tandem short circuit density with reduced standard deviation from a mean value of 19.3 ± 0.4 mA/cm2 to 19.8 ± 0.2 mA/cm2, increased average fill factor from 68% to 73% and average power conversion efficiency increase from 22% to 25%.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the WO3-x/PVA composite films as smart photochromic coatings on glass substrate by two methods: solvent casting (SC) and dip-coating (DC). The two methods were thoroughly compared using experimental and theoretical means. All prepared films have been optically investigated by ex-situ and in-situ UV–Vis spectrometry, leading to insight on their coloring/bleaching amplitudes and kinetics. It was found that the SC films exhibited the best photochromic amplitude with a visible and infrared optical contrast ΔCvis=34.37 and ΔCIR=7.9, whereas ΔCvis and ΔCIR reached less than 20.2 and 5.4 for the best films issued from the DC process. Further, a two-flux model (KubelkaMunk) was adapted to understand the associated impacts of absorption and scattering in our composite films. The calculations revealed that the simulated scattering factor was higher in the case of the DC films than for the SC films, explaining hence the higher photochromic amplitude of the latter. After carefully analyzing the relationship between the SC and DC films characterizations and optical performance, we concluded that the SC method offered films that are a better candidate for post-optical application in terms of scattering reduction, improved visible/infrared contrast, and better photochromic efficiency. Nevertheless, the “thick” SC films get a slightly lower kinetic response than the “thin” DC films. Finally, the cooling effect of the photochromic SC films was tested by integrating them in a model wooden room under the irradiation of an artificial solar source. The photochromic SC smart windows proposed here are equally efficient while being more affordable than electrochromic panels or VO2 thermochromic thin films to reduce the inner house temperature (almost 20 °C) upon solar irradiation, demonstrating their great potential as smart cost-effective energy-saving materials

Abstract: Metal foam was adopted for improving inherent low thermal conductivity of traditional thermal energy storage (TES), which conducted higher solar energy conversion efficiency. With consideration of more energy response and the mixing enhancement effect on heat conduction and natural convection, this work investigated a vertical TES tube in solar energy photothermal utilization systems, embedded in metallic foam with radial gradient porosity and pore density. Experiments and simulations have both been carried out. It is thoroughly examined how the liquid fraction, solid-liquid interface, temperature field, and velocity field evolve, and the properties of energy storage, such as heat transfer density and energy storage quantity, are further assessed. Results demonstrated that the melting duration was shortened by 11.2% for the positive radially graded porosity arrangement and prolonged by 16.8% for the negative, in comparison to the homogeneous structure. Meanwhile, influenced by the varied porosity, the temperature uniformity was enhanced by 4.9% for the positive and was deteriorated by 15.1% for the negative. In addition, positive and negative gradient pore density respectively increased the temperature uniformity of by 15.1% and 16.7%. Based above, metal foam tube with negative gradient porosity and pore density was suggested to build the more efficient photothermal solar energy conversion systems due to faster melting process and more homogeneous temperature uniformity.

Abstract: Module reliability and service lifetime are critical factors in improving photovoltaic system performance and reducing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Soldering and lamination of the cell impart residual stresses that persist over time and superimpose additional loads during operation. This paper demonstrates the use of X-ray Topography (XRT) to image in-situ the dynamic response of a glass/backsheet mini-module upon drying at elevated temperature after saturation at humidity levels compatible with accelerated testing. The local water content in the encapsulant is also determined in-situ over time via Water Reflectometric Detection (WaRD), with diffusion of water in the front (glass side) and rear (backsheet side) resolved. As water diffuses out from the back of the glass/backsheet module, the cell curves towards the backsheet concomitantly. We find that the cell edges deflect 40 μm out-of-plane with respect to its center while the encapsulant dries, compared to ∼100 μm deflection when heating from 25 °C to 85 °C. The local cell deflections (changes in cell orientation) are correlated with the dynamic loss of water in the backside encapsulant. We conclude that the observed cell deflections are the result of hygroscopic stress induced by the encapsulant upon moisture outdiffusion. Therefore, the cell experiences a continually changing stress state and curvature dependent on local humidity and temperature. Depending on cell architecture and interconnection, this “breathing” mode of the cell may induce wear out and fatigue of the interconnects, affect the electrical connection of cracked pieces or cause failure near the interconnected edges of two cells.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the most promising nanostructured solar cells for large-scale production, have been fabricated with different types of electron and hole collectors to improve efficiency and stability. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is an important measurement to evaluate the optical/electrical behavior of the structure to modify the device structure. In this research, we have investigated how different mechanisms affect the IPCE spectra and the difference between short-circuit current density (Jsc) recorded from the current density-voltage (J-V) and the IPCE curves of n-i-p PSCs. Results show that by removing the electron-transport layer (ETL) in a device with a compact PSK layer, the IPCE spectrum does not change and only a slight shift of interference peak position is observable. By removing the hole-transport layer (HTL), not only IPCE value drops substantially for all wavelengths, its shape (including interference peaks) deforms significantly in the 500–800 nm wavelength range. In the case of cells with imperfect HTLs, only a slight change in this range (not the blue range) is observable. Utilizing different charge-transport and PSK materials, we have shown how significant the nonlinearity of the device's characteristics (such as charge-transfer resistance) with light intensity increases in the difference between Jsc value from J-V and integrated Jsc from IPCE curves. Selecting charge-collecting layers also directly affect interference peaks in IPCE spectra, for instance using TiO2 nanograss as ETL or CuIn0.75Ga0.25S2/carbon hole-collector instead of Spiro OMeTAD/Au hole-collector results in disappearing interference peaks.

Abstract: Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease and approximately one-third of its carriers do not have evident genetic abnormalities. The mutation of specific molecular markers, such as fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FTL3) internal tandem duplication (ITD), FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and nucleophosmin (NPM1), are associated with an adverse and favorable prognosis, respectively.
Objective
The objective was to determine the prevalence of FLT3/ITD and NPM1 in Chilean patients and their association with clinical data and prognosis.
Method and Results
Two hundred and thirty-two children were studied between 2011 and 2017, the median being 8.6 years (ranging from 1 to 18 months). Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was diagnosed in 29%. The FLT3/ITD-mutated in non-promyelocytic AML was at 10% (14/133) and the FLT3/TKD, at 3.7% (2/54). In APL, it was at 25.4% (16/63). In non-promyelocytic AML, the FLT3/ITD-mutated was associated with a high leucocyte count, the median being 28.5 x mm3 (n = 14) versus 19.4 x mm3 (n = 119), (p = 0.25), in non-mutated cases. In APL, the median was 33.6 x mm3 (n = 15) versus 2.8 x mm3 (n = 47), (p < 0.001). The five-year overall survival (OS) in non-promyelocytic AML with non-mutated and mutated FLT3/ITD were 62.7% and 21.4%, respectively, (p < 0.001); the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) were 79.5% and 50%, respectively, (p < 0.01). The five-year OS in APL with non-mutated and mutated FLT3/ITD was 84.7% and 62.5%, respectively, (p = 0.05); the 5-year EFS was 84.7% and 68.8%, respectively, (p = 0.122). The NPM1 mutation was observed in 3.2% (5/155), all non-promyelocytic AML with the normal karyotype.
Conclusion
The FLT3/ITD mutation was observed more frequently in APL and associated with a higher white cell count at diagnosis. However, the most important finding was that the FLT3/ITD mutation was associated with a shorter survival in non-promyelocytic AML.

Abstract: Introduction
Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a serious complication of cancer chemotherapy. The present study aimed to identify risk factors for documented infection in pediatric patients with FN and cancer.
Methods
This prospective cohort study included patients under 18 years from 2016 to 2018. Infection was defined according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.
Results
A total of 172 febrile neutropenic episodes were evaluated. From univariate analysis, the risk factors were: female gender; monocyte count < 100 cell/mm³, platelets < 50,000, C-reactive protein (CRP) > 90 mg/dl and hemoglobin < 7mg/dl at the onset of an episode; two or more episodes of FN, and; fever onset; positive blood culture at the fever onset. Independent risk factors according to the multivariate analysis were: CRP at the onset of a febrile episode > 90mg/dl, fever onset and first blood culture with a positive result. The lowest probability of infection was related to first episode and to platelets > 50,000 at the onset of fever.
Conclusion
A CRP > 90 at the onset of a febrile episode, platelets < 50,000, second episode or more, first fever episode during hospitalization and positive first blood culture were found to be associated with a higher risk of infection and they could be useful for the establishment of risk scores for infection in neutropenic children.

Abstract: A Fe3O4/Fe2O3 photoelectrode exhibiting excellent broadband and light-trapping characteristics has been prepared. It is found to be of unique multi-scale structure that is composed of pyramids from 5 to 10 μm in width grown on nanorod arrays from 400 to 500 μm in diameter. This multi-scale structure displays an extraordinary surface catalytic-activity and photothermal effect, which result in strong absorption in UV–Vis–NIR region and significantly improved PEC performance. Besides, type II p-n Fe2O3/Fe3O4 heterojunction with suitable energy position and its built-in electric field favor separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. The optimized Fe2O3/Fe3O4 photoanode therefore exhibits a much larger photocurrent density ∼0.68 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under simulated sunlight illumination compared to 0.08 mA/cm2 of the pure Fe2O3 photoelectrode. This unique design for multi-scale structure may provide a route to develop high-efficient photoelectrode with full-spectrum response.

Abstract: Introduction
Cancer-associated thrombosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in malignancy patients. Prophylactic anticoagulation is under-utilized and the cost of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and direct oral anticoagulants is a major barrier in developing countries.
Material and methods
A retrospective analysis was performed of all cancer-associated thrombosis patients attending the thrombosis clinic at a tertiary-level referral hospital based in North India between 2011 and 2015. Patient demographics and disease-related parameters were collected and analyzed.
Results
A total of 771 patients attended the thrombosis clinic during study period, of which 64 cases were malignancy-associated. Of these, 56% of the patients were female and 20% were bedridden. The median age was 48.5 years, adenocarcinoma (48%) being the most common histological subtype. Gynecological malignancies (30%) were the most common malignancies, followed by genitourinary (11%) malignancies. Most of the cases occurred during first year of diagnosis (51%), and only 14% occurred after 3 years. Most of the patients were on combined treatment. Almost 40% of the patients developed thrombosis within 30 days of surgical treatment. Lower limb thrombosis was the most commonly seen type (56%), while abdominal and pulmonary thrombosis were both seen in 5%. Patients were managed with LMWH and vitamin K antagonists (84.3%) and only 6.25% with LMWH alone. Direct oral anticoagulants were not commonly used during the study period.
Discussion
At the hospital studied, most of the cases occurred early in the disease course. Postoperative prophylaxis could have contributed towards reducing thrombosis in the peri-operative period. Early suspicion and prompt treatment can improve quality of life in such patients.

Abstract: Polyethylene-based poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA), polyolefin elastomer (POE), and thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) are common polymer candidates for photovoltaic (PV) module encapsulants. The choice of encapsulant must be carefully considered in novel module designs, such as bifacial glass/glass laminates, to limit performance degradation through loss of optical transmittance, mechanical integrity, and corrosion—as well as potential-induced degradation. Encapsulant quality and resilience against environmental stressors are readily influenced by the additives in the encapsulant formulation. Here, we show that, the changes in optical transmittance after UV aging result from the discoloration caused by interactions between additives, and optical scattering from changes in the polymer crystal structure. We observed competing cross-linking and chain scission mechanisms, with their kinetics influenced by the presence of oxygen and elevated temperatures. Increasing chamber temperatures from 55 °C to 85 °C during the UV stress test amplified encapsulant discoloration and promoted polymer cross-linking, causing severe, irreversible damage that remains to be proven field relevant. Damp heat aging was found to be insufficient to produce significant encapsulant degradation; however, combining stress tests sequentially allowed detection of further degradation beyond the limitations of the damp heat test alone. Appropriate degradation screening methods are necessary to uncover potential encapsulant weaknesses.

Abstract: Thin film photovoltaic devices based on CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 find in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4-based technology a more eco-friendly alternative. To further reduce production costs and improve sustainability, other abundant metals, such as manganese, can be tested as a potential alternative to zinc. Mn is a safe and Earth-abundant element, and it can be used in light absorber materials when it is part of quaternary chalcogenides with copper and tin. This work reports on the growth and characterization of Cu2MnSnS4 thin films produced by a two-step deposition process. The metallic precursors have been deposited by sputtering and the stack annealed at high temperatures in sulphur atmosphere. The layers, obtained in Cu-poor Mn-poor compositional regime, have been tested in solar devices with a record efficiency of 1.13% and a high open-circuit voltage of about 445 mV delivered by the champion device after over one year from the first PV measurement. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron, Raman, photoluminescence, and admittance spectroscopies have been used to investigate the Cu2MnSnS4 defectivity, and a scenario of high defects has emerged. Therefore, to promote the development of Mn-based photovoltaics the synthesis methodology should be optimized and the device architecture should be specifically designed for the compound.

Abstract: Electrical low frequency noise (LFN) measurements are utilized in this work, in order to identify parasitic low voltage transport mechanisms in diced aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) photovoltaic (PV) cells, which cannot be identified by I–V characterization. A detailed method of LFN analysis is proposed, taking into account the co-existence of various transport mechanisms, that typically occur in parallel in such devices. A precise examination of the 1/f noise level dependency with both current and voltage, combined with static I–V characterizations at various temperatures, enabled the identification of two flicker noise sources appearing at different current regions: one attributed to local linear shunt mechanisms and a second one to a fluctuation in a nonlinear parasitic conductivity localized at the samples’ edges. The latter source exhibits noise signatures resembling either tunneling or Poole-Frenkel transport, while excluding Shockley-Read-Hall recombination processes. This hypothesis was further verified by measurements of thermal activation energies typical of tunnel and Poole-Frenkel conduction mechanisms.

Abstract: The emergence of new PV applications in society requires the design of new materials and devices based on green and earth-abundant elements, with a different set of properties and wider applicability. In this perspective, Bi2S3 semiconductor material have gained attention as a defect-tolerant, non-toxic, and highly stable material for earth-abundant thin film PV technologies. Related to Bi2S3 non-toxic nature, so far it has been very popular to synthesize the material by chemical solution routes, while little research efforts have been dedicated to absorber deposition by physical deposition techniques. In particular, there are no studies on absorber development via rapid, high-volume, and in-line close-spaced sublimation technique. Moreover, in-depth analysis of material defects employing low temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically study the impact of close-spaced sublimation (CSS) conditions on Bi2S3 absorber growth on various substrates, employing a wide range of source (400–600 °C) and substrate (200–400 °C) temperatures. CSS source temperature of 550 °C and substrate temperature of 400–450 °C were identified as optimal temperatures (grown either on glass, TiO2, or CdS substrates), allowing the fabrication of uniform and dense Bi2S3 films with enhanced [221]-oriented grains. For the first time, a proof of concept solar cell with CSS Bi2S3 is demonstrated and an in-depth analysis on the interrelation between grain structure, interface recombination, and device performance is provided. Employing low-temperature dependence PL, new and complementary insights on possible defects and recombination mechanisms are presented.

Abstract: In recent years, high energy demands have posed a huge challenge to the research community to come up with efficient and robust energy-producing materials. In lieu of this, materials discovery by building a Process-Structure-Properties (P–S–P) relationship for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells using mathematical and statistical models is a useful approach, however, computationally expensive and time-consuming. The present study utilizes the physics-based model to develop the Process-Structure (P–S) relationship for 68 different blend ratios and proposed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to map blend concentration with structural properties of OPV cells, namely, Percolation Fraction (PF) and Interfacial Area (IA). The fitted ANN model is then utilised for multi-objective optimization to find the optimal concentration of donor and acceptor to have maximum PF and IA using a Genetic Algorithm; this is further verified by search-based multi-objective optimization to have better insight into the design sub-space which contained optimal solution. Finally, the optimal values of concentrations are validated through device optimization where efficiency predictions were made on structural data of the same morphologies using a mechanistic and regression model. It has been demonstrated that the amalgamation of data-driven techniques and physics-based simulation is the new way forward for accelerated material discovery.

Abstract: Dual performer electrochromic (EC) supercapattery devices are very promising smart devices for next-generation energy storage because they can indicate the energy levels by EC color indicator. To develop the dual-performer EC supercapattery, we have synthesized a metallo-supramolecular polymer (MSP) (Fe-TpyTzTpy) with an electron-withdrawing thiazolo[5,4-d] thiazole-based spacer and redox-active Fe(II) centers complexed with bisterpyridine based chelating units. The Fe-TpyTzTpy thin film exhibits a reversible and durable purple taupe to yellowish orange EC color change when measured either in a typical three-electrode measurement or in two electrode solid-state electrochromic device (ECD) based on gel electrolyte. The ECD demonstrates a fast-coloring time of 0.32 s and a bleaching time of 2.7 s with a high coloration efficiency of 324 cm2/C. The fabricated thin-film device also serves as a supercapattery as the dense metal ion-based reversible and diffusion-controlled redox mechanism of Fe-TpyTzTpy delivers a high average volumetric energy density of ∼13.0 mWh/cm3 and the power density of ∼5 W/cm3. The unaffected Coulombic efficiency (83%) and high retention (73%) in volumetric capacitance over 10000 repetitive galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycles propose the excellent durability of the EC supercapattery device. So, the dual-function device presented in this work has enormous potential for use in next-generation EC smart windows and as portable energy storage displays that can change color according to their stored energy level.

Abstract: We studied, using a combination of animal and cellular models, the glial mechanisms underlying the anti-neuropathic and anti-inflammatory properties of PAM-2 [(E)−3-furan-2-yl-N-p-tolyl-acrylamide], a positive allosteric modulator of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In mice, PAM-2 decreased the inflammatory process induced by the combination of oxaliplatin (OXA), a chemotherapeutic agent, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a pro-inflammatory molecule. In the brain and spinal cord of treated animals, PAM-2 reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines by mechanisms involving mRNA downregulation of factors in the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway, and increased the precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF). To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory activity of PAM-2, both human C20 microglia and normal human astrocytes (NHA) were used. The results showed that PAM-2-induced potentiation of glial α7 nAChRs decreases OXA/IL-1β-induced overexpression of inflammatory molecules by different mechanisms, including mRNA downregulation of factors in the NF-κB pathway (in microglia and astrocyte) and ERK (only in microglia). The OXA/IL-1β-mediated reduction in proBDNF was prevented by PAM-2 in microglia, but not in astrocytes. Our findings also indicate that OXA/IL-1β-induced organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) expression is decreased by PAM-2, suggesting that decreased OXA influx may be involved in the protective effects of PAM-2. The α7-selective antagonist methyllycaconitine blocked the most important effects mediated by PAM-2 at both animal and cellular levels, supporting a mechanism involving α7 nAChRs. In conclusion, glial α7 nAChR stimulation/potentiation downregulates neuroinflammatory targets, and thereby remains a promising therapeutic option for cancer chemotherapy-induced neuroinflammation and neuropathic pain.

Abstract: Nanofluid-based direct absorption solar collectors (NDASCs), where the transfer fluid also shows the solar absorption functionality, could offer advantages with respect to existing conventional surface-absorber thermal solar collectors, due to volumetric radiation absorption and reduced thermal resistance at the absorber-fluid interface. In the framework of investigation of novel nanofluids with favourable properties for NDASC applications, the present work is aimed to assess the stability (by dynamic light scattering), structural (by transmission electron microscopy and EDS) and optical properties (by optical transmittance measurements) of aqueous nanofluids containing boron carbide (B4C) and titanium carbonitride (TiCN), both as mono or hybrid nanodditives. The chosen B4C and TiCN materials are representative components of the family of so-called Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs), which are known for a number of appealing properties, among those high-temperature stability and promising bulk optical properties, while the optical properties at the nanoscale were unexplored to date. No formation of nanocomposites was evidenced, while optical properties of nanofluids resulted substantially changed with respect to the pure base fluid and promising for solar absorber applications. The dynamic viscosity was also evaluated, in order to check if the pumping power required for the flow of the new materials differs substantially, finding a Newtonian behaviour and a minimal viscosity increase.

Abstract: Thin films of hafnium and hafnium carbide were deposited by pulsed magnetron sputtering of a Hf cathode in an atmosphere of argon and acetylene (C2H2) at room temperature. Different flow rates of C2H2 gas were injected into the chamber to form distinct HfCx compounds and to analyze changes in their structural, chemical, morphological and optical properties in the UV-VIS-NIR regions. The analyzed samples are flat, with an average roughness of less than 1 nm. The refractive index of HfCx films shows a weak dependence on the chosen C2H2 flow rates, whereas the extinction coefficient decreases significantly with increasing gas flow rate, making the use of this material attractive in many applications. The accurate knowledge of the complex refractive index of this material is essential to fill the gap in the current literature and to accurately design optical structures for energy conversion purposes, such as selective solar absorbers (SSAs), selective emitters (SE), dielectric mirrors (DM). We have designed and optimized SSAs based on HfCx, Si3N4, and SiO2 that maximize the solar-to-thermal energy conversion efficiency in high vacuum solar thermal panels.

Abstract: Introduction
Phagocytosis of autoantibody-sensitized coated platelets through Fc gamma receptors on phagocytic cells is an important mechanism of thrombocytopenia in primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).
Objective
We aimed to investigate the contribution of the FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa genes polymorphism to the risk of ITP and their association with disease characteristics in Egyptian children.
Methods
A case control study was conducted on eighty children with primary ITP and eighty age and sex healthy matched subjects as a control group. The FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa genes polymorphism was detected using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
Results
We found that the FcγRIIa‐131H and ‐131R allele frequencies were 51.3 % and 48.7%, respectively, in children with ITP, versus 75% and 25%, respectively, in controls (p = 0.002). The compound heterozygous HR genotype was significantly higher in ITP patients (p < 0.05). The FcγRIIIa-158F and ‐158V allele frequencies were 46.3% and 53.7%, respectively, in children with ITP, versus 70% and 30%, respectively, in controls (p = 0.002). The compound heterozygous VF genotype was significantly higher in ITP patients (p < 0.05). The combined HR/FV genotype was 47.5% in ITP patients, versus 10% in controls (p < 0.001). No significant difference was found between children with newly diagnosed ITP and those who developed chronic ITP, regarding the frequency distribution of the FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa alleles and genotypes (p > 0.05).
Conclusion
There is a possible association of the FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa genes polymorphism with the risk for, and genetic susceptibility to ITP in Egyptian children, but large-scale studies are still needed to support our findings.

Long-term durability of transparent backsheets for bifacial photovoltaics: An in-depth degradation analysis,

Abstract: Bifacial modules with a glass/transparent backsheet (G/CB) structure offer many advantages, such as lighter weight, smaller heat capacity, and higher anti-soiling ability, over their glass/glass (G/G) counterparts. However, compared to traditional opaque backsheets, transparent backsheets can be more susceptible to degradation because UV light can more easily go through the transparent outer layer into the backsheet core and inner layers. Therefore, a better understanding of the degradation mechanism and long-term durability of emerging transparent backsheets is needed. In this study, the G/CB laminated coupons constructed with silica glass, polyolefin elastomer encapsulant (POE) and three types of fluoropolymer-based transparent backsheets were subjected to accelerated weathering under ultraviolet (UV) light at 65 °C and 50% relative humidity (RH) for up to 3600 h with additional 200 thermal cycles. The maximum UV dose (1800 MJ/m2) is equivalent to approximately 45 years of field exposure in Arizona, assuming a 12% albedo for reflected light on the backside of a PV module. The transmittance of the coupons was characterized by UV–visible spectroscopy periodically during UV exposure. Cross-sectional characterization of optical, chemical, and mechanical degradation was conducted on the transparent backsheets of the aged and unaged coupons using confocal fluorescence microscopy, microscale infrared spectroscopy, and nanoindentation, respectively. Results showed that superficial outer layer cracking occurred on coupons constructed with a polyvinyl fluoride (PVF)-based backsheet (G/CB1) at the end of the exposure.Local delamination appeared near a corner of the coupon with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-based backsheet (G/CB2). However, the coupon containing a fluoroethylene vinyl ether (FEVE)/polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA)-based transparent backsheet (G/CB3) showed the greatest yellowing, as well as substantial backsheet cracking. Significant degradation was not only observed on the FEVE outer layer but also in the PET core layer of CB3. The depth-dependent degradation was seen in fluorescence, micro-IR and nanoindentation mapping of the aged CB3. This study suggests that, although the application of transparent backsheet is promising, careful considerations of the long-term UV durability are needed when designing and selecting backsheets for 50-year bifacial modules.

Abstract: CaCl2–NaCl molten salt is a promising material for energy transport and storage. The microstructure evolution and properties of CaCl2–NaCl molten salt are significantly important for improving energy conversion eﬃciency. In this study, machine learning potentials were applied to explore the effect of composition and temperature on the structure and properties of CaCl2–NaCl molten salt. It showed great merits, such as considerable economic cost, high efficiency and accuracy, and a safe working environment. The structural information of CaCl2–NaCl molten salt was analyzed systematically, including partial radial distribution function, coordination number distribution, and angular distribution function. The distorted octahedral structure of Na–Cl and Ca–Cl ion pairs was observed in CaCl2–NaCl molten salt and the degree of distortion varied with the components. Besides, the influence of composition and temperature on properties were investigated, including density, ion self-diffusion coeﬃcients, shear viscosity, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient, and specific heat capacity. In summary, the machine learning potential molecular dynamics simulations have a blazing application prospect in theoretical research of molten salt systems and can provide great fundamentals for practical application.

Abstract: The following work deals with interpreting defect spectroscopy results for CIGS solar cells. The motivation and brief background for defect physics investigation in photovoltaic materials is presented. Since the subject of defect spectroscopy interpretation in CIGS has been discussed for many years and plenty of experimental results are available, we present here those that we believe are the most important. Characteristic and essential features of signals observed in CIGS are shown, which have eluded unambiguous interpretation and made it impossible to propose a coherent physical mechanism so far. The physical models co-existing in the CIGS community are also briefly discussed. Emphasis is placed on which features of the observed signals are explained by models and which are not. The main aim of the presented work is to introduce a new model describing the results of admittance spectroscopy in CIGS solar cells based on the existence of hole barriers at the grain boundaries. Most completely, the presented model explains the characteristic features of the measured signals, including the variability of the activation energy of the observed processes, its dependence on the hole concentration, and its correlation with the results of conductivity measurements. The model assumptions and simulation results show how the concentration of surface donors at the grain boundaries affects the height of the grain boundary barriers and the measured concentration of holes in the CIGS. The simulations are presented for different grain sizes and confronted with experimental results.

Abstract: Zinc phosphide (Zn3P2) has been lauded as a promising solar absorber material due to its functional properties and the abundance of zinc and phosphorous. In the last 4 decades, there has not been any significant improvement in the efficiencies of Zn3P2-based solar cells. This is vastly due to the limited understanding of how to tune its optoelectronic properties. Recently, significant progress has been made in the growth and characterization of the material, which has shed light on its potential. In this study, we report an energy conversion efficiency as high as 4.4% for a solar cell based on a polycrystalline Zn3P2/InP heterojunction. This device presents an open circuit voltage of 528.8 mV, 7.5% higher than the Zn3P2 homojunction record. We investigate the dominant recombination mechanisms within the film using different techniques to identify the key factors underpinning our device efficiency. In particular, we pinpoint that reduced carrier collection at the front of Zn3P2 is responsible for the reduced collection of high-energy photons. This allows us to suggest the design rules for next-generation Zn3P2-based heterojunction solar cells, which should allow us to go beyond the current conversion values.

Abstract: In situ Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) were applied to study the compositional and optical stability of a WAlSiN-based solar-selective coating (SSC) at high temperatures in vacuum. The samples were exposed to heating-cooling cycles between quasi room temperature and stepwise-increased high temperatures of 450 °C, 650 °C and 800 °C, respectively. In situ RBS revealed full compositional stability of the SSC during thermal cycling. In situ SE indicated full conservation of the optical response at 450 °C and 650 °C, and minimal changes at 800 °C. The analysis of the ex situ optical reflectance spectra after the complete thermal cycling gave an unchanged solar absorptance of 0.94 and a slightly higher calculated thermal emittance at 800 °C of 0.16 compared to 0.15 after deposition. Cross-sectional element distribution analysis performed in scanning transmission electron microscopy mode confirmed the conservation of the SSC microstructure after the heating – cooling cycles. The study demonstrates compositional, optical and structural stability of the WAlSiN-based solar-selective coating at temperatures targeted for the next generation of concentrated solar power plants.

Abstract: The rapid increase in annual cooling energy demand has a significant adverse impact on global warming. Recent research on passive radiative cooling using various materials to reduce energy use for cooling has been reported. Most previous studies focused on solar reflection and mid-infrared (IR) emission based on photonic crystal materials. In this study, wave-selective emitter coolers in the atmospheric window range were fabricated using glass bubbles (GBu) and barium sulfate (BaSO4) in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Then, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers were electrospun on the prepared coolers. The optical properties and cooling power according to the ratio of GBu and BaSO4 contained in the cooler and PAN electrospinning conditions were analyzed.

Abstract: This study addresses the influence of different encapsulation materials on performance losses in bifacial PV modules after extended damp heat testing. The widely used ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) is compared to polyolefin elastomers (POE) and thermoplastic polyolefins (TPO). We show that modules based on n-type bifacial solar cells (tunnel oxide passivated contact, TOPCON) are more prone to degradation than p-type (Passivated emitter rear cell, PERC) based laminates. More specifically, the front side metallization of these n-type cells corrodes under extended damp heat testing, yielding a decreased fill factor in the I–V characteristics and the appearance of dark spots and dark areas in electroluminescence imaging. The newer generation of encapsulant materials (POE and TPO), slowly replacing EVA in the modules commercialized today, demonstrate an improved protection of the metallization. Apart from the nature of the encapsulant, the cell type and the presence or absence of glass cover plates are also shown to influence the metal grid corrosion. To better understand the mechanisms at play, post-mortem analysis was carried out on small sized degraded PV laminates, by drilling out circular samples (“coring”) that could be analyzed in depth. The analyses revealed a weakened bond between the metallization and the silicon emitter, ultimately causing metal grid delamination. The proposed mechanism behind this delamination starts with the degradation of lead glass, which is part of the cell metallization grid and contains lead oxide (PbO). This compound is susceptible to dissolution in acidic environment.

Abstract: We investigate the performance of monolithic copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CIGS)/perovskite tandem solar cells with two different CIGS bottom device absorbers: Cu(In,Ga)Se2 or Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 and with three different hole-transporting layers (HTLs): NiOx + SAM, NiOx:Cu + SAM and SAM alone. NiOx(:Cu) is (2 wt% copper-doped) nickel oxide and SAM is the MeO-2PACz ([2-(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid) self-assembled monolayer. The CIGSe is fabricated by physical-vapor deposition (PVD), has a Eg ∼ 1.06eV, and a σRMS,PVD ∼ 65 nm, while the CIGSSe is fabricated by rapid-thermal processing (RTP), has a Eg ∼ 1.01eV, and a σRMS,RTP ∼ 120 nm. While the current certified, 24.2%-efficient, world-record monolithic CIGSe-perovskite tandem solar cell has previously been achieved with SAM as a stand-alone HTL, this work investigates whether SAM can yield similarly high efficiencies also on industrially compatible, very rough RTP CIGSSe absorbers. We find that the devices with SAM as stand-alone HTL suffer from severe FF and Voc losses and that NiOx:Cu is needed to act as a shunt-quenching layer below that SAM, ensuring conformal coverage of the rough bottom sub-cell surface. Within this work the highest-achieved (in-house measured) PCEs for the RTP and PVD CIGS-based tandems are 21.6% and 23.2% respectively, on a cell area of 1.08 cm2, both of which are obtained with NiOx:Cu + SAM as an HTL.

Abstract: In the conventional successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), the slow growth and uneven distribution of quantum dots (QDs) in TiO2 mesoporous films limit the loading amount of QDs, decreasing the effectiveness of QDs to improve quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). Especially in CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells, the growth of CdS QDs on the surface of TiO2 films blocks the internal voids, making it difficult to load the post-sequence CdSe into the interior of the TiO2 mesoporous films. Herein, we have developed a simple and rapid voltage-assisted SILAR technique (VASILAR) to load CdS/CdSe QDs into the TiO2 mesoporous films more efficiently. Comparing with conventional SILAR method, the electric field generated by imposing the voltage could drive the ions to diffuse/penetrate rapidly into the interior of the mesoporous films, promoting the preferential deposition of a large number of CdS in the deep region of the films. A uniform distribution of CdS in TiO2 mesoporous films is achieved. The uniform distribution of CdS leaves sufficient space and channels for the loading of the post-sequence CdSe inside the films. Further with the help of electric field forces, the growth and distribution of CdSe in the film are also well regulated. Finally, the rapid growth and uniform distribution of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDs in TiO2 mesoporous films as well as a high loading amount of QDs are attained. The resulting CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSSCs exhibits an outstanding efficiency of 5.7%, and a remarkable stability after over 660 min.

Abstract: Solar steam generation is a promising and efficient strategy to address the issues of water shortage. It is still challenging to design a solar evaporator possessing high evaporation efficiency with eminent durability. Herein, a flexible porous film was successfully designed and synthesized by a simple in-situ solvothermal deposition of MoO2 nanospheres on hydrophilic PTFE film. Metallic MoO2 possesses high chemical stability, low cost and tunable localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which is beneficial for light absorption, photothermal conversion, and operational durability of solar-driven interfacial water evaporator. The absorption spectrum of MoO2 nanospheres almost remains stable after acid, alkali and heating treatment. And hydrophilic PTFE membrane with porous and stable properties are crucial for fast water supply, vapor transportation and stable evaporation performance. As a solar steam generator, the hybrid membrane demonstrates high evaporation efficiency of 91% under one illumination and superb stable evaporation performance in harsh environments, such as acid solution, alkali solution and high-concentration seawater. The as-prepared membrane has the ability to decrease salinity of Yellow Sea water below the World Health Organization standard for drinkable water. The rational design provides enlightenment for potential applications of water evaporation in harsh environments.

Abstract: Next generation concentrated solar thermal power can produce receiver temperatures up to 800 °C, however current solar salt based thermal storage is limited to 560 °C. Eutectic salt mixtures with high melting temperatures are potential latent heat energy storage media, and store heat in a solid-liquid phase change. This approach reduces the amount of material required, and therefore physical size of the storage system. This work investigates the compatibility of a binary eutectic mixture of 52.81 wt% K2CO3 and 47.19 wt% Na2CO3 salt with three high temperature alloys (316L, 347H and 800H) was assessed at the maximum proposed temperature of 750 °C under high purity argon cover gas. This salt proved to be very aggressive to the alloys tested, with corrosion rates determined to be approximately 1 mm/year for the 316L and 800H alloys, and up to 10 mm/year for 347H. The corrosion product was found to consist of sodium chromite (NaCrO2) and iron and nickel oxides. After testing niobium was detected in the solidified salt in greater amounts than in the corrosion product, indicating that the niobium corrosion product was soluble in the salt. Additionally, the 800H experienced significant grain boundary oxidation, throughout the test sample. A corrosion mechanism is proposed, based on chemical thermodynamics, which suggests that the salt will dissociate when in contact with metal at a lower temperature than previously determined. Likely corrosion reactions are discussed, and the higher corrosion rate for the niobium containing 347H was attributed to an oxygen producing reaction, which accelerates the attack on the metal.

Abstract: Developing conjugated polymers with broad spectrum modulation is highly desirable in electrochromic field. Herein, three novel polymers based on fused thienothiophene derivative (tris(thienothiophene) (TTT) or indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT)) and two acceptors (5,8-bis(4-(2-butyloctyl)thiophen-2-yl)-dithieno[3′,2':3,4; 2″,3'':5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (TBT) and 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole (BT)) are synthesized via direct arylation polymerization (DArP). The neutral copolymers exhibit visibly broadband absorption due to the combination of the π-π* transition and intramolecular charge transfer absorption, which can be tuned by the feed ratio of the donor and acceptor monomers. As a result, the copolymer synthesized by IDTT, TBT and BT with a feed ratio of 3/2/1 presents a black color in the neutral state and high transparency in the oxidized state, which gives an average optical contrast of 34% in the visible band (400 nm–700nm), good stability and high coloration efficiency (370 cm2/C). Additionally, an electrochromic device with excellent electrochromic performance is fabricated based on the synthesized polymers. All of these confirm the synthesized polymers are attractive candidates for broad absorption electrochromism.

Abstract: The effects of growth conditions on InAs/GaAs submonolayer-quantum-dot solar cells are still a little explored topic, and the literature shows contradictory results regarding the efficiency of these devices. Through electrical and optical characterizations (photoluminescence, current-voltage curves, and external quantum efficiency) and self-consistent Schrödinger–Poisson simulations in the effective-mass approximation, we investigate how the reconstruction of the GaAs(001) surface prior to the deposition of InAs/GaAs submonolayer quantum dots influences the properties of these nanostructures and the performance of solar cells. Current-voltage characteristics and external quantum efficiency curves show that the use of the (2 × 4) surface reconstruction—instead of the commonly used c(4 × 4) surface reconstruction—leads to higher short-circuit current density and improved performance at room temperature. The (2 × 4) surface reconstruction also leads to enhanced photoluminescence intensity at low temperatures compared to the c(4 × 4) surface reconstruction. The simulations—which are based on previous cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy data of InAs/GaAs submonolayer quantum dots—indicate that neither type of submonolayer quantum dot can confine electrons, as they are too small and their In content is too low. However, the electron ground state is closer to being confined in the SMLQDs grown with the (2 × 4) surface reconstruction, as such nanostructures are surrounded by a thick InGaAs layer having a lower In content than for the other surface reconstruction. The discussion presented herein elucidates a contradiction between different reports found in the literature regarding the conversion efficiency of InAs/GaAs submonolayer-quantum-dot solar cells and indicates possible ways forward for achieving 3D electron confinement in these devices.

Abstract: Hybrid concentrator photovoltaic-thermoelectric systems aim to increase the conversion efficiency of sunlight to electricity by recovering part of the waste heat generated in the photovoltaic cells by means of thermoelectricity. They are in a research stage, with many theoretical predictions of their potential benefits, especially when increasing the light concentration ratio, but few experimental demonstrations. They have been never tested under ultra-high concentration levels (>2000x). In this paper, the results of an experimental assessment of the state-of-the-art technology to develop such hybrid systems under extreme concentrations are presented. A hybrid mono-module was designed, manufactured and tested under ultra-high concentration both indoors and outdoors. Indoor experiments used a steady light sun simulator for effective low concentrations from 1.3 to 17.2 suns and a multi-flash simulator for geometric concentrations from 476x to 3600x. Outdoor experiments covered concentrations between 476x and 2066x. A conventional concentrator photovoltaic-only mono-module was also tested outdoors for comparison purposes. The experimental characterization of the prototype showed that some optimistic values used in the theoretical predictions (such as the temperature coefficients of the solar cell, the thermoelectric efficiency or the optical efficiency of conventional concentrators) cannot be fulfilled with the current commercially available components. Results of the outdoor measurements exhibit a similar energetic behaviour of the hybrid system compared to the conventional system at 476x. For higher concentrations, the performance of the hybrid system is poorer than that of the conventional system due to a faster degradation of the optical, thermal and electrical behaviour. The solar cell was damaged when it reached 194 °C at 2066x outdoors. The study sheds light on the limits of the current technology and identifies improvement research areas: optical systems for ultra-high concentration, solar cells with a wider operating temperature range and lower temperature and series resistance losses, thermoelectric generators with higher figure-of-merit and innovative cooling systems. These areas need to be explored to reach experimentally the potential benefits of this technology.

Abstract: Molten chloride salt is recognized as a promising heat transfer fluid and thermal energy storage material (TES) in concentrating solar power (CSP) in recent years, and its phase diagram as key data for material design still need further research. In this work, the phase equilibrium characteristics of solid-liquid equilibrium and vapor-liquid equilibrium for binary chloride salt system (Na/K–Ca/Mg) are investigated respectively. Based on Wilson model, the activity coefficient and non-ideal behavior of liquid salts are predicted effectively, and then the solid-liquid phase diagrams of binary salts are calculated, and the predicted eutectic temperature and component agree well with experimental data. Vapor-liquid phase diagrams of binary salts are also calculated, and azeotropic temperature can only be found in the MgCl2 based mixed salts. As the system pressure rises, the azeotropic temperature increases, while azeotropic component slightly changes. According to the variation of vapor pressure for eutectic salts, the correlations for vapor pressure with temperature and composition are developed. Thermal stability of eutectic salts is experimentally studied by Thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) and operating temperature ranges of these mixed salts are revealed. It can be found that the mass loss rate at different temperature is directly proportional to the vapor pressure. In general, present binary chloride salts show wide operating temperature range and high heat storage density, and eutectic NaCl–MgCl2 with advantage of heat storage density and azeotropic point existence is recommended as TES in the CSP plant.

Abstract: The exceptional photovoltaic properties of Sn-based perovskite solar cells (Sn–PSCs) have caught the interest of researchers as a potential candidate for the development of non-toxic PSCs. Nevertheless, the Sn–PSCs still face some critical drawbacks, such as the easier oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and the moisture permeation, which reduce their stability and power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, to tackle these limitations, we added a Lewis base additive formamidinesulfinic acid (FASO2H) to the perovskite precursor solution. The FASO2H Lewis base additive could successfully reduce the oxidation of Sn2+/Sn4+ by 32%, improved the crystallinity and decreased the lattice strain by 66% in the respective films. As a result, the charge carrier recombination minimized and the FASnI3-FASO2H (3 mol%) based PSCs produced a PCE of 7.44%. The FASO2H additive also offers superior moisture protection for Sn–PSCs thanks to its hydrophobic sulfinic acid group. Notably, the Sn–PSCs exhibit a high light soaking stability by maintaining 90% of the initial PCE up to 450 h when tested under maximum power point tracking conditions.

Abstract: Electrolytes, especially the gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) play an important role in an electrochromic device (ECD), and have received extensive attention in recent years. GPEs combine the advantages of both liquid and solid electrolytes, and provide a new solution for realizing solid-state ECDs. In this work, polyacrylamide (PAM) GPE with a high ionic conductivity of 6.4 × 10−2 S cm−1 at room temperature was synthesized by an in situ free radical polymerization in an ECD, where Prussian blue (PB) and tungsten trioxide (WO3) were used as electrochromic (EC) layers. The in situ polymerization realizes a much better match between the electrolyte layer and the EC film. A large optical modulation of 74.8% at 678 nm and a high coloration efficiency of 154.5 cm2·C−1 are achieved for the obtained PB/PAM GPE/WO3 device. Due to the high ionic conductivity and fast ion transport, the ECD also has a fast coloration time (tc) of 2.1 s and a bleaching time (tb) of 1.7 s. Additionally, the ECD maintains 90.6% of optical modulation after 13,500 cycles, demonstrating an excellent cycling stability.

Abstract: Tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) thin films were prepared at low substrate temperature by direct-current magnetron sputtering technology and applicated as the electrode of silicon heterojunction solar cells (HJT). The chemical, electrical and optical properties of ITO films deposited at different sputtering power are investigated. The optimized ITO films are applied as electrode of HJT solar cells, and the conversion efficiency of more than 25.22% is obtained. In addition, the passivated degradation resulting from ITO deposition is analyzed. The result shows that the degradation is recovered by the annealing process. Finally, the degradation of solar cell efficiency in dark nitrogen environment is tracked. It is found that the solar cells with the highest average conversion efficiency have poor stability, which is mainly attributed to the degradation of the fill factor.

Abstract: Nowadays, green energy conversion and storage materials are the research attention. Reusable stability is an important indicator in the application. In this work, the framework material formed by polyaniline (PANI) and MXene shows strong intrinsic light absorption performance and outstanding cycling stability for the solar-light to thermal energy conversion. With composition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and PANI/MXene, a series of composite phase change materials were prepared, exhibiting great reusable capacity for solar light response and thermal energy storage. In this system, PM24 (n(PANI): n(MXene) = 100:24) shows the best comprehensive performance. During melting and freezing process, its latent heat values are as high as 150.93 J/g and 146.6 J/g, respectively, and the corresponding enthalpy efficiency are 90.1% and 89.6%, respectively. After ultra-long 1000 heating-cooling cycles, only 2.91% and 2.87% enthalpy rate loss of melting and freezing, indicating its superior cycling stability. Furthermore, with excellent solar light absorption capacity, the solar-to-thermal conversion efficiency of PM24 exceed 95.29%, and it also keeps stable reusability. Hence, PM24 exhibits a huge potential in terms of heat storage and photothermal conversion for long-term use.

Abstract: The thermoplasmonics effect has achieved increasing attention because it can be utilized as an efficient and highly localized heat source at the nanoscale, but there have been few studies to well clarify and quantify it in the process of plasmonic solar water splitting. In this work, Au-rGO/TiO2 photoelectrode is fabricated by loading Au nanoparticles (NPs) and rGO onto TiO2 nanoring-nanotube arrays via electrodeposition and cyclic voltammetry, respectively. COMSOL Multiphysics is used to simulate and calculate the temperature field of Au nanoparticles, and the obtained data is selected and imported into the artificial neural network model to further predict the temperature of 800–1000 Au NPs arrays under AM 1.5 light intensity. The predicted results are consistent with the temperature rises of the reaction system measured by an infrared thermal imaging camera. The temperature at which Au-rGO/TiO2 reaches a steady state has been verified to be 314.55 K, which can greatly accelerate the thermoplasmonics effect based on Au NPs and the positive effect of rGO on the heat transfer process from Au to TiO2. This work innovatively combines multiphysics simulation with machine learning, providing an approach to quantify the thermoplasmonics effect of photoelectrode in solar-hydrogen conversion.

Abstract: Histone hypermethylation represses gene transcription, which affects cartilage homeostasis or joint remodeling. Trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) changes epigenome signatures, regulating tissue metabolism. This study aimed to investigate whether loss of H3K27me3 demethylase Kdm6a function affected osteoarthritis development. We revealed that chondrocyte-specific Kdm6a knockout mice developed relatively long femurs and tibiae as compared to wild-type mice. Kdm6a deletion mitigated osteoarthritis symptoms, including articular cartilage loss, osteophyte formation, subchondral trabecular bone loss, and irregular walking patterns of destabilized medial meniscus-injured knees. In vitro, loss of Kdm6a function compromised the loss in expression of key chondrocyte markers Sox9, collagen II, and aggrecan and improved glycosaminoglycan production in inflamed chondrocytes. RNA sequencing showed that Kdm6a loss changed transcriptomic profiles, which contributed to histone signaling, NADPH oxidase, Wnt signaling, extracellular matrix, and cartilage development in articular cartilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing uncovered that Kdm6a knockout affected H3K27me3 binding epigenome, repressing Wnt10a and Fzd10 transcription. Wnt10a was, among others, functional molecules regulated by Kdm6a. Forced Wnt10a expression attenuated Kdm6a deletion-induced glycosaminoglycan overproduction. Intra-articular administration with Kdm6a inhibitor GSK-J4 attenuated articular cartilage erosion, synovitis, and osteophyte formation, improving gait profiles of injured joints. In conclusion, Kdm6a loss promoted transcriptomic landscapes contributing to extracellular matrix synthesis and compromised epigenetic H3K27me3-mediated promotion of Wnt10a signaling, preserving chondrocytic activity to attenuate osteoarthritic degeneration. We highlighted the chondroprotective effects of Kdm6a inhibitor for mitigating the development of osteoarthritic disorders.

Abstract: The present work reports on the optimization of a simple two-step procedure to achieve thermochromic vanadium dioxide coatings. The effect of the layer thickness, the total surface area exposed, as well as different parameters involved in a fast annealing process leads to the selective oxidation in air atmosphere of vanadium films sputtered at glancing angles. Outcomes resulting from structural and optical characterizations of annealed films with different layer thicknesses and porosities disclose two optimal pathways for the fast heating synthesis of high-performance VO2-based coatings with unique thermochromic features. A first one at 475 °C with reaction times ranging from 40 to 60 s, ideal for thicker films (∼100 nm), which implies reaching pseudo-equilibrium states with the formation of a VO2 + VO2+x phase mixture. A second one more adapted for thinner samples (∼25 nm), which involves obtaining VO2-refined products through instantaneous reactions at 500 °C. The unusual balance achieved for luminous transmittance (>60%) and solar modulation ability (∼5%) through the second route, coupled with a remarkable decrease in the metal-to-insulator transition temperature without the need of using doping (up to 15 °C below that of the pure bulk VO2, i.e., ∼68 °C), make these initially porous systems potentially applicable in energy efficient smart glazing or resistive switching while paving the way for further initiatives towards the simple and cost-effective manufacturing of VO2 thermochromic coatings at a large scale.

Abstract: Molten salt is a typical PCM in solar thermal utilization, the disadvantage of low thermal conductivity has been improved by various methods. However, only enhancing the thermal conductivity can't reach a satisfactory optimization goal. Aiming to improve the key thermal performance indexes of LHTES, multi-properties collaborative equivalent optimization is preliminarily presented here, which partly breaks the fixed mode of purely enhancing thermal conductivity. A numerical simulation model of a typical shell-and-tube storage tank was established, and a L25(56) orthogonal simulation experiment was carried out. By evaluating the key thermal performance indexes and through range analysis, the influence laws and importance order of thermophysical properties are obtained. Moreover, the relationship between the key performance indexes and thermophysical properties is fitted, and a rough alternative optimization quantitative relationship is obtained. The results show that thermal conductivity and phase transition temperature have the greatest influence on almost all performance indexes at the early stage (1 h–1.5 h), and the specific heat capacity and latent heat gradually exceed them after 1.5 h. Compared with the stored exergy and stored heat energy during 4 h, the benefit from thermal conductivity enhancement during 2 h is nearly three and four times, respectively. Therefore, low thermal conductivity can be compensated by decreasing the phase change temperature in the case of fast energy storage process, while by increasing the specific heat capacity and latent heat in the case of slower one. After evaluating the feasibility and cost of adjusting each thermophysical property, the synergetic optimization scheme has more practical value.

Abstract: Passive radiative cooling is a novel concept and is likely to be important for building and industrial energy efficiency efforts, as it will significantly contribute to the reduction of thermal management costs for electronic equipment. In most studies, radiative cooling devices are not considered for their colors; although to find a large number of users, it must be attractive to designers or architects, who usually pay significant attention to aesthetic and decorative aspects of paints. Since the majority of the coatings reported in the literature are white, there is also a need to develop color-coordinated paints and coatings. Here, we propose an approach for designing a simple structure of colored radiative cooling devices assisted by a plasmonic structures. We show that they can be tuned as desired to produce different hues of colored coatings, while maintaining adequate radiative cooling power. To demonstrate the conflicting functions of color display and radiative cooling performance, we use a bowtie nanoantenna as a color-displaying structure to investigate how the structural factors affect the cooling performance and color display accordingly. We show that periodic high index-low index alternating layers (SiO2–TiO2) on top of a thin silver layer cause broadband reflection in visible and near-infrared spectrums, while to achieve narrowband absorption in the visible region, which leads to the desired colorization, the bowtie nanoantenna is utilized. We report that by changing the structural parameters of a nanoantenna, the resonance peaks are controlled to yield a narrowband absorption in the visible spectrum to create different colors. Moreover, our results indicate that although adding coloration structure to a conventional radiative cooling system reduces the cooling power by around 30%, it is still reasonable high, around 60 W/m2, and is still suitable to be used for daytime radiative cooling where control over the color is needed. Acceptable cooling power while ability to control the coloration make the proposed colored radiative cooling a potential candidate to be used in various applications, both in high end buildings or for thermal management of electronic equipment.

Abstract: Form-stable phase change fibers (PCFs) that are composed of stable supporting material (as polymer matrix) and phase change material (PCM, as working ingredient) have become novel smart materials, being widely applied in energy storage, thermal regulation and the biomedical field. However, the inherent limitation of PCFs is the restriction of the supporting material on the crystallization of the PCM, which results in low phase change enthalpy (ΔH). Here, six different types of PCF comprised of poly(lactic acid) (PLA, as supporting material) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, as PCM) have been fabricated. Their morphology, phase change performance and structural transitions during phase change have been extensively studied. We reveal that the crystallizability and glass transition temperature of PLA have a dominating influence on ΔH. In the optimum system, PLA/PEG PCFs can achieve up to 104 J/g ΔH which is close to the theoretical value of pristine PEG. This high-performance PCF also exhibits only 2.5% ΔH loss after 100 thermal cycles and good ability in thermal energy storage and thermal regulation. This work provides a promising form-stable PCF and introduces a new strategy towards developing high ΔH PCFs by selecting suitable supporting materials.

Abstract: Iron chelators, such as deferoxamine, exert an anticancer effect by altering the activity of biomolecules critical for regulation of the cell cycle, cell metabolism, and apoptotic processes. Thus, iron chelators are sometimes used in combination with radio- and/or chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer. The possibility that deferoxamine could induce a program of senescence similar to radio- and/or chemotherapy, fostering adaptation in the treatment of cancer cells, is not fully understood. Using established biochemical techniques, biomarkers linked to lipid composition, and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy, we demonstrated that hepatocellular carcinoma-derived HepG2 cells survive after deferoxamine treatment, acquiring phenotypic traits and representative hallmarks of senescent cells. The results support the view that deferoxamine acts in HepG2 cells to produce oxidative stress-induced senescence by triggering sequential mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction accompanied by autophagy blockade. We also focused on the lipidome of senescent cells after deferoxamine treatment. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the deferoxamine-induced senescent cells presented marked remodeling of the phosphoinositol, sulfatide, and cardiolipin profiles, which all play a central role in cell signaling cascades, intracellular membrane trafficking, and mitochondria functions. Detection of alterations in glycosphingolipid sulfate species suggested modifications in ceramide generation, and turnover is frequently described in cancer cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Blockade of ceramide generation may explain autophagic default, resistance to apoptosis, and the onset of senescence.

Abstract: Tumor recurrence, acquired resistance and metastasis have severely limited the effect of clinical treatments for epithelial ovarian cancer. Recent researches reveal that cancer stem cells play important roles in the process of cisplatin-induced resistance and cancer cell metastasis. A platinum(II) complex (HY1-Pt) owning casein kinase 2 specificity reported in our recent research was herein applied to treat cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant epithelial ovarian cancers, respectively, anticipating to achieve high anti-tumor efficacy. HY1-Pt showed highly efficient anti-tumor effect with low toxicity for either cisplatin-sensitive or cisplatin-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Biological studies indicated that HY1-Pt as a casein kinase 2 inhibitor could effectively overcome cisplatin resistance through the signaling pathway of Wnt/β-catenin by inhibiting expression of the signature genes of cancer stemness cells in A2780/CDDP cells. Moreover, HY1-Pt could suppress tumor migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo, further proving that HY1-Pt can be a potent novel platinum(II) agent for cisplatin-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer treatment.

Abstract: Introduction
Hyperglycemia occurs in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) due to chemotherapeutic agents and may be stress-induced. Given the potential impact of hyperglycemia on the clinical outcomes of ALL patients, we sought to determine the association of hyperglycemia with the development of infectious complications.
Methods
This is a retrospective cohort involving adult Filipino ALL patients admitted at a tertiary referral center. Patients were stratified according to blood glucose levels and infections were classified into microbiologically and clinically defined infections. Logistic regression was performed to determine whether hyperglycemia was associated with the development of infectious complications.
Results
Of the 174 patients admitted for ALL, only 76 patients (44%) underwent blood glucose monitoring and were thus included in this study. Hyperglycemia was observed in 64 patients (84.21%). Infectious complications were seen in 56 patients (73.68%), of whom 37 patients (48.68%) had microbiologically defined infections and 19 (25%) had clinically defined infections. The respiratory tract was the most common site of infection and gram-negative bacteria were the predominant isolates. Hyperglycemia significantly increased the likelihood of infectious complications, particularly at blood glucose levels ≥ 200 mg/dL.
Conclusion
Hyperglycemia is associated with an increased likelihood of infectious complications in Filipino ALL patients. With sepsis being one of the main causes of mortality in this population, our study provides compelling evidence for us to consider routine blood glucose monitoring in order to manage and potentially decrease the occurrence of infections in these patients.

Abstract: MOCVD grown GaInP/GaAs/InGaAs flexible solar cells are irradiated by 14 MeV neutrons and the degradation characteristics of solar cell output parameters are investigated by experimental and numerical simulation methods. The solar cell performance is degraded significantly with the increase of irradiation fluence. When the neutron irradiation fluence reached 7.3 × 1012 n/cm2, the maximum output power density of solar cell is reduced to 70% of its initial value. The main reasons for the degradation are the displacement damages in solar cell lattice caused by the irradiation which is resulting in a considerable reduction in minority carrier lifetime and inefficient photo-generated electron-hole pair collection. Crosslight APSYS software is employed to simulate the solar cell main parameters by solving current continuity and Poisson’ s equations, the degradation mechanism is discussed based on the changes of minority carrier lifetime by SRH (Shockley Read Hall) recombination for different irradiation fluences and energy bandgap structure of each subcell.

Abstract: For a better environmental sustainable development, the construction and new energy vehicle industries have paid more attention to electrochromic (EC) materials that can regulate light and heat to reduce energy use. We report a series of high-performance tungsten-niobium (W–Nb) bimetallic oxide films composed of nanowire/cluster directly grown on transparent conductive glasses by a solvothermal process. Large optical modulations in visible (Vis) (77.0%) and near-infrared (NIR) (79.7%) light regions, and high average coloration efficiency (CE‾) of 107.8 cm2·C−1 are achieved for the W–Nb bimetallic oxide films. The solvothermal preparation creates conditions for exploring the rules of the EC properties of W–Nb bimetallic oxide films with the atomic ratios of W to Nb. The EC properties of bimetallic oxides are designable by verifying their atomic ratios of W to Nb, which provides a theoretical support for searching high-performance bimetallic oxide EC films. In addition, we introduce real-time CE and CE‾ besides the traditional maximum CE to evaluate the coloration performance of the EC films. This creates a foundation for the further research on the CE of EC materials and devices in the future.

Abstract: Background
The role of ALDOC which is an important regulator involved in tumor metabolic reprogramming and immune microenvironment in GC remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility of ALDOC as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.
Methods
We verified the expression of ALDOC in GC and its effect on the prognosis of GC patients by analyzing clinical data. The regulation of ALDOC on the biological behavior of GC cells was confirmed by experiments. The potential mechanism of miRNA regulating GC immune cell infiltration by inhibiting ALDOC was explored by experiments and bioinformatic analysis. We further analyzed the effect of ALDOC on somatic mutations in gastric cancer, and constructed a prognostic model based on ALDOC and related immune molecules.
Results
ALDOC is overexpressed in GC cells and tissues, which promotes malignant biological behavior of GC cells and is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis of GC patients. MiR-19a-5p promotes the expression of ALDOC by down-regulating ETS1, leading to poor prognosis in GC patients. ALDOC is significantly associated with immune infiltration in GC, regulates macrophage differentiation and promotes the progression of GC. ALDOC is significantly correlated with TMB and MSI of gastric cancer, and affects somatic mutation of gastric cancer. The prognostic model has good predictive efficiency.
Conclusions
ALDOC is a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target with abnormal immune-mediated effects. The prognostic model based on ALDOC provides a reference for prognosis prediction and individualized treatment of GC patients.

Abstract: Introduction
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare clinical laboratory condition with high mortality rates, resulting from ineffective overactivation of the immune system. Data in the Brazilian literature is scarce, contributing to the challenge in standardizing conducts and performing an early diagnosis of HLH.
Objective
To describe the clinical, laboratory, and evolutionary findings on HLH patients treated at a pediatric hospital.
Methods
This is an observational, cross-sectional and retrospective study on children diagnosed with HLH, hospitalized between 2009 and 2019. The diagnostic criteria were those described in the Histiocyte Society protocol. The authors evaluated HLH patient laboratory tests, myelograms and bone marrow biopsies, clinical characteristics and therapy.
Results
Twenty-three patients were included, 52.2% of whom were males. The age at diagnosis ranged from one to one hundred and eighty months. Four cases were classified as Primary HLH and nineteen, as Secondary HLH. The main triggers were infections and rheumatological diseases. All children had bicytopenia, and 95.4% had hyperferritinemia. Nineteen patients had liver dysfunction, sixteen had neurological disorders and fourteen had kidney injury. Pulmonary involvement was seen in 61.9%, acting as a worse prognosis for death (p = 0.01). Nine patients underwent the immuno-chemotherapy protocol proposed in the HLH 2004. The time to confirm the diagnosis varied from five to eighty days. The lethality found was 56.3%.
Conclusions
The present study is the most extensive retrospective exclusively pediatric study published in Brazil to date. Despite the limitations, it was possible to demonstrate the importance of discussing HLH as a pediatric emergency.

Abstract: Extracellular matrix protein 2 (ECM2), which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation, has recently been reported as a prognostic indicator for multiple cancers, but its value in lower grade glioma (LGG) remains unknown. In this study, LGG transcriptomic data of 503 cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and 403 cases in The Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database were collected to analyze ECM2 expression patterns and the relationship with clinical characteristics, prognosis, enriched signaling pathways, and immune-related markers. In addition, a total of 12 laboratory samples were used for experimental validation. Wilcoxon or Kruskal-Wallis tests demonstrated highly expressed ECM2 in LGG was positively associated with malignant histological features and molecular features such as recurrent LGG and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type. Also, Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves proved high ECM2 expression could predict shorter overall survival in LGG patients, as multivariate analysis and meta-analysis claimed ECM2 was a deleterious factor for LGG prognosis. In addition, the enrichment of immune-related pathways for ECM2, for instance JAK-STAT pathway, was obtained by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis. Furthermore, positive relationships between ECM2 expression with immune cells infiltration and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), iconic markers (CD163), and immune checkpoints (CD274, encoding PD-L1) were proved by Pearson correlation analysis. Finally, laboratory experiments of RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry showed high expression of ECM2, as well as CD163 and PD-L1 in LGG samples. This study identifies ECM2, for the first time, as a subtype marker and prognostic indicator for LGG. ECM2 could also provide a reliable guarantee for further personalized therapy, synergizing with tumor immunity, to break through the current limitations and thus reinvigorating immunotherapy for LGG.

Abstract: PET laminated photovoltaic modules present a high level of fire hazard, with varying levels of risk in complex external environments. This paper presents the experimental results of the ignition and combustion behavior of a PET laminated photovoltaic panel using the Fire Propagation Apparatus. The ignition time, heat release rate, combustion equivalent ratio, and total heat release were measured at different external heat flows and ventilation levels. The ignition time was determined as a function of the external radiant heat flow and the ventilation volume, respectively. The experimental results showed that the ignition time was sensitive to the change of external heat flow under different experimental conditions, but at lower external heat flow, the increase of ventilation had a great contribution to the shortening of the ignition time. The oxygen consumption method was used to determine the heat release rate under multiple boundary conditions, the value of which depends on the close coupling effect of external radiant heat flow and ventilation and is positively correlated with both. The immediate effect of boundary conditions on combustion efficiency was analyzed by equivalence ratios. For the total heat release, the external radiant heat flow directly plays a decisive role, but the ventilation volume can play a great role in promoting, especially under the low external heat flow.

Abstract: In this paper, well oriented TiO2@WO3 nanorod arrays were synthesized and applied in AlCl3 aqueous (AlCl3-H2O) electrolyte for enhancing dual-function of single material. Benefiting from large specific surface area and stable structure of TiO2@WO3, as well as small ionic radius and trivalent characteristics of Al3+, the composite showed excellent electrochromic-capacitive properties and super stability, including large optical modulation (83.5% at 800 nm), excellent stability (the optical modulation only decreased by 2.3% after 3000 cycles; the specific capacitance value remained 92% after 1000 cycles at 5 A/g) and good energy storage level (248.3 F/g at 1A/g). Notably, the “ion trap” model was firstly applied to the Al3+ aqueous electrolyte to clarify the degradation and repair mechanisms of electrode. Different from Li + based organic electrolyte, only “eliminable trap” that eroded the colored state was generated after long cycles. The “non-eliminable trap” that reduced the transmittance of the bleached state was hardly produced, which was attributed to the limited voltage range of the aqueous solution and the characteristics of Al3+. In addition, the slightly reduced electrochromic and capacitive properties were both recovered in-situ through applying a constant voltage for de-trapping treatment, suggesting the novel construction of “TiO2@WO3 composite nanoarrays/AlCl3-H2O electrolyte” was the key for durable and repairable electrochromic-supercapacitor (ECSC). More importantly, real devices of TiO2@WO3-based ECSC were constructed and exhibited excellent bifunctional performance. Three devices with 3 × 4 cm2 in series could lit the LED light up, and its color changed with the power supply time, bringing a bright prospect in visual monitoring field.

Abstract: Monoclinic-phase vanadium dioxide (VO2 (M)) has attracted much attention due to the potential for energy-efficient smart window applications, owing to its thermochromism in the infrared region induced by insulator to metal phase transition. The composite coatings fabricated by dispersing VO2 (M) nanoparticles in a polymer matrix are superior to continuous VO2 (M) coatings due to their advantages in large solar modulation ability and high luminous transmittance. Ultrafine high-quality VO2 (M) nanoparticles are desired to achieve the excellent thermochromic performance of the VO2-based composite films. In this study, we present a fast synthesis of ultrafine VO2 (M) nanoparticles by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The crystal phase and morphology evolution along the synthesis process was studied in detail. Low-reaction temperature (200 °C) favored the formation of intermediate nanosheets of VO2･xH2O with a lateral size of 50–500 nm. As the temperature increased, the edges of the nanosheets were gradually consumed and grew into nanoparticles with imperfect crystallinity. At higher temperature of 300 °C, the VO2･xH2O nanosheets collapse and eventually transform into pure single VO2 (M) nanoparticles with average size ∼20 nm. The optimal duration for the synthesis of VO2 (M) nanoparticles in the microwave hydrothermal reaction at 300 °C was only 8 min. The flexible thermochromic films fabricated with the VO2 (M) nanoparticle-polymer composite coating exhibited excellent thermochromic performance with a solar modulation efficiency of 20.73% and luminous transmittance of 55.04%, the values being one of the best reported thermochromic performance of hydrothermally synthesized VO2 (M).

Abstract: The actual energy market based on fossil fuels is the responsible of more than half of the greenhouse gases generated worldwide. Renewable energies play a fundamental role to lead the transformation towards an energy market less damaging for the environment. Concentrated solar thermal (CST) energy is essential to achieve this objective because it is the most profitable renewable technology to store energy in the form of heat. In recent years, solar tower (ST) systems are the most installed CST plants thanks to their high operating temperatures that allow reaching greater efficiency. Developers are presently considering the integration of secondary concentrators on the top of the tower to improve its optical and thermal behavior, and hence, to increase the performance and feasibility of the system. However, no commercial high-temperature secondary reflector materials for ST systems are marketed because their durability is currently unpredictable. In this work, a new methodology based on accelerated aging tests is developed to predict the lifetime of secondary reflector materials in short time. Additionally, operating conditions that typically take place on a ST are simulated in a solar furnace to validate the reliability of the aging tests. The protocol developed was applied to a novel secondary material recently developed. According to the results obtained for this exemplary material, the main degradation is suffered due to the high temperature during operation. The correlation was validated under representative operating conditions with deviation of 0.2% of the reflectance comparing the accelerated aging and the operating conditions tests.

Abstract: Towards latent heat storage for days, or even extending to months in the context of solar energy utilization, the exploration of phase change materials (PCMs) with stable supercooling and the following crystallization triggering are carried out. The present work confirmed the persistent supercooling property of the xylitol/erythritol eutectic mixture. The coupled technique combining mechanical agitation with seeding was proposed to trigger crystallization, so as to facilitate the heat retrieval whenever heat is in demand. The xylitol/erythritol eutectic keeps supercooling state without crystallization at ambient temperature for at least 10 days, thus it can serve as applicable PCM for controllable heat retrieval. Such severe supercooling is mainly attributed to the particular molecular structure of polyalcohols and dramatic increase of dynamic viscosity. In particular, on the basis of secondary nucleation principle, the coupled technique combining mechanical agitation and seeding can be a preferable technique to efficiently trigger crystallization of the present eutectic PCM, so as to realize controllable heat retrieval. Such combined technique has main advantages of high efficiency and reproducible crystallization process. The agitation duration is shortened to 1.8 min with seeding, in comparison to a longer value of 43.3 min without seeding. Although the single technique of mechanical agitation can also trigger the crystallization, the agitation is found to be time-consuming and the triggered crystallization process is in poor consistency among parallel specimens. Furthermore, the crystallization initiating is greatly advanced with high agitation rate (300 r/min), and the agitation duration to sufficiently activate crystallization can be significantly shortened. The results suggest that appropriately high agitation rate favors the efficient heat retrieval. The obtained results are helpful to gain a better understanding on the supercooled PCMs based controllable heat retrieval.

Abstract: Tin-lead (Sn–Pb) mixed perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the advantage of low bandgap to photovoltaic application, have been developed well in recent years, but the poor stability and rapid crystallization of Sn–Pb perovskite cause the large open-circuit voltage (Voc) loss and defects. Here, we report a coordination effect to passivate Sn defects by adding 4-pyridine-methylamine iodine (PyAI) in perovskite precursor solution to optimize morphology and enhance the performance of Sn–Pb mixed PSCs. It's found that multiple coordination bonds are formed in Sn–Pb mixed perovskite under the reaction of PyAI in an acid environment, which lead to modulate Sn–Pb mixed perovskite film formation process, improve film crystallinity, reduce electronic disorder, and optimize the overall film quality. As a result, 1.5%PyAI-treated Sn–Pb mixed PSCs exhibit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) improvement from 14.87% to 17.04% compared with the control Sn–Pb mixed PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated 1.5%PyAI-treated device maintains 80% of its initial performance after being stored in an N2-filled glove box for 15 days, also inhibitory effect of the oxidation process is obvious under the air environment condition.

Abstract: Recent inorganic multi-color electrochromic electrodes frequently contain thick reflecting coatings, sacrificing transparency and limiting their applications. In the present work, a strategy for creating inorganic multi-color transmissive-type electrochromic electrodes (MCTEEs) is proposed within the context of an asymmetric Fabry-Perot interferometer, which satisfies the aesthetic requirement for color variation while maintaining adequate transmittance. Based on the optimized design, a prototype MCTEE was successfully created using the magnetron co-sputtering technique, which has a high potential for use in transparent display and decorating applications because of its good cycle stability (72.4% optical modulation remained after over 600 cycles), the fast response time (6.5 s/3.8 s for coloration/bleaching process), and the good color tunability (pink, colorless, light blue, and dark blue with various applied voltages).

Abstract: The high efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the key factors to ensure their industrialization. Surface doping of perovskite films has been proved as an efficient strategy to achieve more efficient and stable PSCs. Plenty of work has been focused on passivating perovskite films by organic molecules and studying the corresponding passivation mechanism. However, very few studies have paid attention to the effect of surface dopants on the crystallization process during the formation of perovskite films. Herein, we employ a simple organic molecule phenylphosphonic acid (PPA) as a surface doping agent to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 PSCs and focus on the effect of PPA on the crystallization process of perovskite films. The PPA molecules can slow down the crystal nucleation and growth rate of perovskites and inhibit the formation of δ-FAPbI3 phase to obtain α-phase perovskite films with high quality, due to the multifunction of PPA as crystal growth controller and passivator of perovskite films. Finally, the PCE of FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 PSC with an effective area of 0.255 cm2 increased from 18.95% to 22.02%, which is among one of the highest efficiencies of FA/CsPbI3 PSCs with such big active area. Meanwhile, air environmental stability and thermal stability of the devices were also improved significantly. In addition, the 5 × 5 cm-module device with an effective area of 19.32 cm2 obtained a high PCE of 19.12%. This surface doping strategy has obtained great benefits from multifunctional small molecules and laid a promising seed for obtaining stable and efficient FACs-based PSCs.

Abstract: Photothermal catalytic hydrogen production is regarded as an effective conversion of solar energy into clean energy carrier. However, the uncontrollable in-situ photo-thermal effect would cause overheating of the catalytic site, thereby reducing the electron transfer efficiency, and the vast amount of energy contained in the near-infrared thermal effect has not been fully utilized. In this study, an Au/TiO2 nanorod catalyst and n-eicosane were employed to establish a core-shell structure to enhance solar energy conversion and regulating in-situ temperature rise during the photothermal catalytic process. The results revealed that the core-shell structure offered an efficient reaction area and high dispersion stability, while the amount of photothermal catalyst loaded also influenced the photothermal catalytic performance. Also, the in-situ overheating is effectively regulated to help enhance efficient electron transfer for hydrogen production. The core-shell structures with Au/TiO2 loading amounts of 9.3%, 14.5%, and 20.2% enhanced hydrogen yields by 30.3%, 42.2%, and 53.8%, respectively, compared to that of pure photothermal catalyst suspension. Meanwhile, the photothermal conversion efficiencies were 33.3%, 64.5% and 88.1% higher than those of 10 vol% glycerol solution. Thus, the photothermal effect has been shown to be effective for improving the performance of photothermal glycerol reforming for hydrogen production, and photothermal catalyst-phase change material composite structures can provide a new idea for promoting solar energy into thermal and chemical energy.

Abstract: Cancer continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide, making the development of new treatment methods crucial in the fight against it. With cancer incidence rates increasing worldwide, ongoing research must focus on identifying new and effective ways to prevent and treat the disease. The combination of herbal extracts with chemotherapeutic agents has gained much interest as a novel strategy to combat cancer. Rumex obtusifolius L. is a wild plant known for its medicinal properties and is widely distributed worldwide. Our preclinical evaluations suggested that R. obtusifolius seed extracts possessed cancer-inhibiting properties and we also evaluated the beneficial effects of the arginase inhibitor NG-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine and nitric oxide inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester in the treatment of breast cancer. The current study aimed to combine these observations and evaluate the antioxidant and antitumor properties of R. obtusifolius extracts alone and in combination with the arginase and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. Metabolic characterization of the plant extract using a liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry advanced system revealed the presence of 240 phenolic compounds many of which possess anticancer properties, according to the literature. In vitro studies revealed a significant cytotoxic effect of the R. obtusifolius extracts on the human colon (HT29) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. Thus, a new treatment approach of combining R. obtusifolius bioactive phytochemicals with the arginase and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and/or NG-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine, respectively, was proposed and could potentially be an effective way to treat breast cancer. Indeed, these combinations showed immunostimulatory, antiproliferative, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiangiogenic properties in a rat breast cancer model.

Abstract: Introduction
During pregnancy, women are at an increased risk of developing iron-deficiency anemia.
Objective
The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of the reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (RET-He) in the early detection of iron-deficiency anemia in a group of pregnant women and to establish a reference range for this parameter in a group of control individuals. Method: A total of 60 patients and 130 control subjects were included in the study. Blood samples collected from the subjects were submitted to a complete blood count and a serum ferritin test and the data were analyzed by comparing the groups and ROC curves.
Results
The reference range found for the RET-He was between 29.75pg and 38.24pg, with a median of 35pg. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for the ferritin parameter showed an area under the curve of 0.732 for the RET-He, 0.586 for hemoglobin, 0.551 for the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and 0.482 for the mean corpuscular volume.
Conclusion
Early diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy is essential to prevent damage to both maternal and fetal health. The RET-He presents an excellent potential as an auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in pregnant women.

Melatonin protects Leydig cells from HT-2 toxin-induced ferroptosis and apoptosis via glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase/glutathione -dependent pathway,

Abstract: HT-2 toxin is a mycotoxin commonly found in food and water that can have adverse effects on male reproductive systems, including testosterone secretion. Ferroptosis and apoptosis are two types of programmed cell death that have been implicated in the regulation of cellular functions. Melatonin, a powerful antioxidant with various physiological functions, has been shown to regulate testosterone secretion. However, the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of melatonin against HT-2 toxin-induced damage in testosterone secretion are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of HT-2 toxin on sheep Leydig cells and the potential protective role of melatonin. We found that HT-2 toxin inhibited cell proliferation and testosterone secretion of Leydig cells in a dose-dependent manner and induced ferroptosis and apoptosis through intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, leading to lipid peroxidation. Exposure of Leydig cells to melatonin in vitro reversed the defective phenotypes caused by HT-2 toxin via a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase/glutathione-dependent mechanism. Interference of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase disrupted the beneficial effect of melatonin on ferroptosis and apoptosis in HT-2 toxin-treated Leydig cells. Furthermore, similar results were observed in vivo in the testes of male mice injected with HT-2 toxin with or without melatonin treatment for 30 days. Our findings suggest that melatonin inhibits ferroptosis and apoptosis by elevating the expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to eliminate reactive oxygen species accumulation in HT-2 toxin-treated Leydig cells. These results provide fundamental evidence for eliminating the adverse effects of HT-2 toxin on male reproduction.

Abstract: Cu2ZnGe(S,Se)4 (CZGSSe) thin films were fabricated by sulfurization of co-evaporated Cu2ZnGeSe4 (CZGSe) thin films. The goal of this work is to investigate the effect of the composition of CZGSe layers on the structural, vibrational and morphological properties of CZGSSe compounds. Different CZGSe layers with different cation's ratios (Cu-poor, Zn-rich; Cu-poor, Zn-stoichiometric and Cu-poor, Ge-rich) were investigated before and after the sulfurization process. Break-off and different cooling experiments during sulfurization of CZGSe were also carried out. Break-off experiments revealed that 440 °C is the key temperature to incorporate S into CZGSe lattice, being required 480 °C to enhance the interdiffusion of the elements. Fast cooling experiments during sulfurization appeared to be a promising strategy to avoid the formation of secondary phases. All the samples showed the CZGSSe kesterite phase, as well as higher S content and different secondary phases at the surface. These experiments demonstrate that a minimum Ge content in CZGSe is required to assist the growth of CZGSSe grains and develop a compact structure. These results indicate the importance of controlling the cation's ratio of CZGSe to develop high quality wide band gap CZGSSe compounds, which can be very attractive for different applications.

Abstract: Solar-driven water evaporation based on photothermal conversion materials, such as woods, sponges, and membranes, have been proved to be promising in the field of fresh water generation. It's urgent to develop portable, versatile, and efficient photothermal materials for affordable freshwater supply. Here, a hydrophilic polysulfone hollow fiber membrane (PSF HFM) with gradient porous structure and diameter of 50 μm was prepared through one-step phase inversion method. Inspired by nature, a highly efficient 3D solar-driven steam evaporator was fabricated via chemical vapor deposition polymerization (CVDP) of hydrophobic polypyrrole (PPy) on PSF HFMs. With rational 3D structure, capillary-driven water transportation property, optical absorption as high as 95%, heat localization, photothermal conversion, a solar-driven water evaporation rate of 2.6 kg m−2·h−1, and the conversion efficiency of 173.2% could be achieved. Furthermore, the HFM tree with affluent light-harvesting, efficient thermal management, and excellent stability showed a purified water collection efficiency of 14.18 L/(m2·day) in practical application, providing a latent way to boost water purification, regeneration, and desalination.

Abstract: Boron laser doping selective emitter (LDSE) has attracted much attention in the current mass-production of n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells. However, boron LDSE technology is limited by the low boron concentration of borosilicate glass (BSG) during boron diffusion, as well as the inefficient doping and laser-induced damage. Here, a thinner BSG layer with high boron concentration has been achieved by adjusting the boron diffusion conditions, which overcomes the insufficient diffusion dynamics caused by the low diffusion and segregation coefficients of boron atoms to improve the surface passivation and promote the laser doping. We have demonstrated that high-temperature annealing has a better repair on laser-induced damage compared with wet etching back due to the surface tension and internal stress after solidification of the silicon molten pool. More importantly, the synergistic effect of high-temperature annealing and wet etching back results in much better results, together with good compatibility with the subsequent cell production processes without increasing production costs. The influence of front emitter parameters has been further quantified theoretically to provide a meaningful guidance for the development of TOPCon c-Si solar cells with front LDSE.

Abstract: Introduction
Lewis antibodies have been thought to play a small role in clinical transfusion practice, but recent reports suggest that they have gained more importance in the context of transfusion and transplantation. Data regarding the prevalence of Lewis antibodies and their clinical significance in the Indian context is very limited. Hence, this study was aimed at analyzing the serological characteristics and clinical significance of Lewis antibodies encountered in our patient and donor populations.
Methods
The retrospective data analyzed the records of red cell antibody screening results and the additional serological evaluation performed on the donor and patient samples included in the study.
Results
A total of 26 study subjects were noted to have Lewis antibodies (including 6 healthy donors and 20 patients). Of them, 13 individuals had anti-Leb, 10 had anti-Lea and the remaining three had an anti-Lea/Leb mixture. IgG Lewis antibodies were detected in 7 individuals. All cases of IgM Lewis antibodies detected were reacting at 37°C. Two patients were suspected of having hemolytic transfusion reactions due to Lewis antibodies. Antigen-negative cross-match compatible units were provided for transfusion in the recipients.
Conclusion
Lewis antibodies of the IgM class reacting at 37°C should be regarded as clinically important. The present study findings urge that the lab personnel look for the thermal amplitude of Lewis antibodies, irrespective of the fact that the antibody class and antigen-negative crossmatch compatible units should be provided to avoid hemolytic transfusion reactions.

Abstract: Flexible Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic (Fc-SiPV) modules have attracted enormous attention from academics and the industry as a convenient, lightweight alternative energy source for indoor and outdoor applications with limited load-bearing capacity, curved roofs and higher energy demand buildings. This research article focuses on the development of lightweight, high-efficiency, glass-free crystalline silicon flexible photovoltaic modules composed of a composite sandwich structure with a polymer front layer. The optical, mechanical, and thermal properties of different commercially available polymer materials such as Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Tedlar Polyethylene Terephthalate (TPT), Ethylene Chloro Tri Fluoro Ethylene (ECTFE), Poly Vinylidene Fluoride (PVDF), Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP), and Ethylene Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (ETFE) are analyzed for their suitability as front sheet material for flexible crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules manufacturing. The flexible crystalline silicon mini-modules are developed and fabricated utilizing the different materials mentioned above through conventional industrial lamination technology. These flexible polymer modules are analyzed in terms of their optical, spectral response, current-voltage characteristics and impact of thermal cycling for their suitability for photovoltaic applications. The findings of the article may be helpful for module manufacturers in selecting suitable polymer materials for the development of flexible crystalline modules.

Abstract: Stacking of wafers for thermal processing enables a strong increase of the throughput and thus offers a high potential for cost reduction in solar cell production. In previous studies, the high temperature stack oxidation (HiTSOx) approach showed promising solar cell results and homogeneous thermal oxide growth over the wafer surface within the stack. In this work, we investigate the thermal oxide growth in the gap between stacked wafers where the wafer surfaces touching each other. We perform finite element method (FEM) simulation to identify the mechanism for the oxygen transport inside the gap and compare the simulated layer thickness to experimental data. In this simulation, the gap height is an important parameter. Therefore, we present a gravimetric-density approach to experimentally determine the gap height. Further, passivated emitter and rear (PERC) solar cells are fabricated using the HiTSOx approach. A high open-circuit voltage of Voc = 694 mV confirms the high quality of the surface passivation achieved in the stack oxidation.

Abstract: Novel hole-transporting materials with high work function (WF) and transmittance are crucial for high-efficiency bifacial CdTe solar cells. Herein, the CuZnSe alloy films prepared by combinatorial sputtering exhibit tunable optical band gap (2.25–2.57 eV), WF (5.05–5.45 eV) and band structure with variable Zn content. A large WF of 5.45 eV for Cu0.46Zn0.74Se and small valence band offset of 0.13 eV at Cu0.46Zn0.74Se/CdTe interface have been determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively, which can promote the hole transport from CdTe absorber to back electrode. A maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.3% was achieved for CdTe solar cells when using Cu0.46Zn0.74Se/Au as back contact. The device characterizations indicate that Cu0.46Zn0.74Se has the excellent effects on reducing back‐contact barrier and suppressing carrier recombination. Moreover, Cu0.46Zn0.74Se/ITO back contact yielded high back-illuminated efficiencies of 4.2% and 5.3% for the 3.2 μm and 1.7 μm CdTe devices, respectively, due to increased transmittance and effective carrier collection. This work provides a promising strategy to obtain optically transparent Cu-containing selenides with high work function by alloying, which have attractive application prospect for bifacial CdTe solar cells.

Abstract: The halide perovskite based solar cells demonstrate rapid progress in photoelectric applications. Recent studies sparked the tremendous interest to the indoor photovoltaics supported by the vision for extensive use of low-power Internet of Things gadgets. The low-intensity illumination conditions are very different from the direct sunlight and artificial light sources (LED etc.) have variation of the emission spectra. In this paper, we investigated the output performance of the halide perovskite solar cells by varying the absorber band gap between 1.60 eV and 1.97 eV under different LED illumination intensity and color temperatures (CT). We also studied the impact of the absorber thickness on the solar cell’s performance under LED illumination. The experimental results show that perovskite absorber with the band-gap of 1.72 eV permits to reach the highest efficiency in the all range of studied CTs (1700–6500K) varying from 31.8% to 34.9% at 200 Lx and from 34.9% to 36.1% at 1000 Lx. The origins of the effects and difference of the output parameters for PSCs were discussed with the estimation of the Shockley-Quiessier limit for LED illumination.

Abstract: Introduction
During pregnancy, the iron requirement increases to meet the optimal growth of the fetus and prevent iron deficiency anemia-related complications in the mother. However, in sickle cell disease (SCD) primarily due to repeated blood transfusions and hemolysis-induced recycling of iron, its supplementation during pregnancy remains questionable and may be harmful.
Methods
Twenty-five pregnant women with homozygous SCD and 25 pregnant women with normal hemoglobin variants were included as cases and control, respectively. Pregnancy and sickle cell anemia (SCA) were diagnosed using standard protocols. The serum iron, serum ferritin, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), percentage transferrin saturation and C-reactive protein were estimated, as per the manufacturer's protocol. The complete blood count was performed. The unpaired ‘t-test’ was performed using the SPSS v23.0 and the principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the online software MetaboAnalyst for statistical analysis.
Main Results
The studied cases had significantly lower mean hemoglobin and higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV), compared to controls. The mean serum-iron, serum-ferritin and percentage transferrin-saturation in the cases were significantly higher than that of the controls, while the TIBC was lower in the cases (p < 0.0001). The mean level of serum iron, ferritin, percentage transferrin saturation and TIBC were 309.44 ± 122.40mcg/dl, 860.36 ± 624.64ng/ml, 42.6 ± 17.30% and 241.32 ± 96.30 mcg/dl, respectively, in the cases and 95.36 ± 41.90mcg/dl, 122.28 ± 49.70ng/ml, 15.83 ± 3.10% and 492.6 ± 149.40mcg/dl in the controls, respectively. Higher MCV, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) with lower hemoglobin (Hb) were noted in the cases. The PCA revealed that the cases were more heterogeneous in terms of the variability of the iron status and hematological indices than the controls.
Conclusion
The current study shows iron sufficiency in most cases of pregnancy with SCA and suggests that evaluation of iron status must be made before initiating iron prophylaxis in pregnant women with SCA, especially in regions having a high prevalence of sickle cell hemoglobinopathy.

Abstract: Photovoltaic cell technology plays an important role in achieving carbon neutrality. However, a major challenge to further improving the conversion efficiency is the recombination and electrical contact of boron (B)-doped emitters in n-TOPCon solar cells. Boron-selective emitters (B-SEs) are ideal candidates for reducing the emitter recombination and contact resistivity of n-type silicon solar cells and for providing better blue response. In this study, the key process parameters of BCl3 tube furnace diffusion (drive-in temperature, oxidation temperature, and BCl3 gas flow, etc.) were identified, and their impact on the performance of the emitter dark saturation current density under the passivation layer (J0) and on the contact resistivity (ρc) was investigated. The results showed that the BCl3 gas flow rate (GBCl3) had much less impact than drive-in and oxidation conditions, which is mainly owing to the lower-temperature deposition with lower boron diffusivity. However, the O2 flow rate under high-temperature oxidation had the greatest impact on passivation and contact resistivity, which is mainly related to the thicker boron rich layer (BRL), resulting in high recombination. We introduced B-SEs formed by 3D printing mask technology and secondary diffusion with p++≈ 75 Ω/sq and p+ ≈ 230 Ω/sq, and the efficiency improved by 0.27% absolute to 24.05%, mainly because of the increased open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 10 mV. After the optimization of B-SEs and passivation processes, we manufactured industrial-grade TOPCon cells with efficiency (Eff), Voc, Jsc, and fill factor (FF) values as high as 24.2%, 721 mV, 40.88 mA/cm2, and 82.1%, respectively. This simplified B-selective emitter and the implementation of passivated contacts can thus be considered to further increase cell efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years utilizing nanoparticles in black paint (nano-paint) of solar desalination absorbers has become a topic growing interest. However, in most of studies, only the effect of using different types of nanoparticles brought into the spotlight, while in those limited studies that discussed on optimum concentration of nanoparticles, the results were controversial and not conclusive. Herein, an experimental study to find the optimum concentration of nanoparticles (silver, 1–5%) in solar absorbers in summer, spring and autumn with/without reflectors was conducted. To find the optimum concentration, performance of the systems from different viewpoints including energetic, exergetic, economic, productivity, exergoeconomic, energy-matrices, and environmental (amount of CO2/SO2/NO emission/reduction) analysis for each season and thorough its lifetime was examined thoroughly. Ascribe the highly variable of parameters; two Matlab codes have been developed to precisely calculate the economic and exergoeconomic parameters for different scenarios. The results showed that increasing the nanoparticle concentration to 5% from an economic viewpoint was reasonable just in summer, while for autumn and spring, 2.5% was optimum. The same was valid for productivity and exergy analysis. Importantly, the embodied energy of nanoparticles for the first time considered in calculation to obtain more accurate results in terms of environmental analysis and energy-matrices. Finally, it was concluded that even though using 5% nanoparticle in limited cases led to better results, the 2.5% concentration with reflector was optimum for all seasons and through the lifetime. This work would be a cornerstone for future researches in the context of using nano-paint in solar absorbers.

Abstract: Cellular stress has been a key factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Major types of cellular stress such as mitochondrial stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, hypoxia, and replicative stress have been implicated in clinical complications of cardiac patients. The heart is the central regulator of the body by supplying oxygenated blood throughout the system. Impairment of cellular function could lead to heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, and even stroke. Understanding the effect of these distinct types of cellular stress on cardiac function is crucial for the scientific community to understand and develop novel therapeutic approaches. This review will comprehensively explain the different mechanisms of cellular stress and the most recent findings related to stress-induced cardiac dysfunction.

Abstract: F-box and WD repeat domain containing 10 (FBXW10) is a member of the FBXW subgroup that contains the WD40 domain. FBXW10 has been rarely reported in colorectal cancer (CRC) and its mechanism is unclear. To investigate the role of FBXW10 in CRC, we conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments. Through the database and our clinical samples, we found that FBXW10 expression was up-regulated in CRC, and it was positively correlated with CD31 expression. CRC patients with high FBXW10 expression levels had a poor prognosis. Overexpression of FBXW10 up-regulated cell proliferation, migration and vascular formation, while knockdown of FBXW10 had the opposite effects. Studies on the mechanism of FBXW10 in CRC showed that FBXW10 could ubiquitinate large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2) and promote its degradation with the Fbox region of FBXW10 played an essential role in this process. In vivo studies demonstrated that knockout of FBXW10 inhibited tumor proliferation and reduced liver metastasis. In conclusion, our study proved that FBXW10 was significantly overexpressed in CRC and was involved in the pathogenesis of CRC by affecting angiogenesis and liver metastasis. Mechanistically, FBXW10 degraded LATS2 through ubiquitination. Therefore, FBXW10-LATS2 can be used as a therapeutic target for CRC in subsequent studies.

Abstract: The loading amount of quantum dots and trap density are the significant issues for quantum dot sensitized solar cells. Anatase TiO2 nanodendrite array is employed as the photo-electrodes for the CuInS2 quantum dot sensitized solar cells instead of the traditional TiO2 nanowire array, which is prepared by two-step hydrothermal process. The excellent charge generation and charge separation properties have been exhibited by the CuInS2 quantum dots sensitized photo-electrodes based on the anatase TiO2 nanodendrite array, which are characterized by the optical absorption spectra and photoluminescence spectra. Meanwhile, the branches from anatase TiO2 nanodendrite array provide much more paths for charge transfer and reduce the charge recombination traps in photo-electrodes, which have provided excellent charge transfer property for the solar cells. As a result, higher current density can be obtained by anatase TiO2 nanodendrite array structure based CuInS2 quantum dot sensitized solar cells, which has exhibited the photovoltaic conversion efficiency enhancement from 4.7% to 5.48%.
