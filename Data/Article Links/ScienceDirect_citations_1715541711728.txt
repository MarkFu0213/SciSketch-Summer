Abstract: The wafers used by the photovoltaic industry are mostly produced by multi-wire slurry sawing. One of the key factors determining the wafer quality (presence of saw marks and chips, increased roughness, wafer thickness variations and wafer strength) is the abrasive slurry. For cost reduction, the slurry is regularly exchanged and the debris it contains is removed in a recycling operation. To optimise the slurry usage, it is of utmost importance to understand the effects of the silicon debris concentration in the slurry. This was studied by sawing several bricks one after the other with the same slurry. It was found that when the amount of debris is too high (more than 4% of the slurry volume), saw marks appear on the wafers and they become more fragile. Finally, a first qualitative model explaining the apparition of the saw marks and the reduction of wafer strength is proposed.

Abstract: In this study, thermal properties of carbon nanofiber (CNF) and carbon nanotube (CNT) filled phase change materials (soy wax and paraffin wax) were studied experimentally, aiming to improve their thermal conductivities. The composite phase change materials (PCMs) were prepared by the stirring of CNF or CNT in liquid wax at 60°C, with CNF and CNT doping levels of 1, 2, 5, and 10wt%. The experimental results show that the thermal conductivity of composite PCMs increases as CNF or CNT loading contents. Both CNF and CNT can improve the thermal conductivity of the composite, while CNF is shown to be more effective than CNT as the thermal conductive filler because of its better dispersion in the matrix.

Abstract: Molybdenum thin films are widely used as back contact for CIGS-based solar cells. In this paper, the properties of Mo layers deposited by DC and RF sputtering are investigated in view of a specific optimization of electrodeposited CIGS solar cells. In the first part of the paper RF and DC films are grown on soda lime glass, in a pressure range from 2 to 20mTorr, and for various RF power and DC current. They are then characterized by optical, electrical and structural methods. It appears that the films deposited by RF mode sputtering are more reflective, conductive and adherent than those obtained by DC mode. Structurally, they present different behaviors with respect to nucleation and growth of CIGS precursor layers by electrodeposition. A large difference is observed in the photovoltaic properties of completed cells, with much better performances obtained with DC Mo layers.

Abstract: A perfluorinated compound, 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (ATMB), was applied as an additive to polymer solar cells (PSCs) with P3HT [poly(3-hexylthiophene)]:PCBM [[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester] blend films. The addition of 6wt% ATMB to a P3HT:PCBM layer led to an increased power conversion efficiency of 5.03% due to the enhanced short circuit current and fill factor when compared with that of the reference cell without an additive. On the other hand, the devices with 4-aminobenzonitrile as an additive, not containing fluorine atoms in the molecule, displayed lower PCEs than that of the reference cell. The UV–visible absorption spectra, X-ray measurements and carrier mobility studies revealed that ATMB facilitated ordering of the P3HT chains, resulting in higher absorbance, larger crystal size of P3HT and enhanced hole mobility. XPS depth profiling measurements also showed that the additive molecules were predominantly positioned in the range of 25nm under the surface of the P3HT:PCBM film, leading to improved fill factor.

Abstract: Cu–In electrodeposited layers were annealed using rapid thermal processing (RTP) in a reactive atmosphere containing sulfur vapors. The CuInS2 formation mechanism during sulfurization of electrodeposited precursors proceeds mainly through direct sulfurization of the metallic Cu–In alloy, forming spinel CuIn5S8 and chalcopyrite CuInS2 ternary phases. During the heating step, the Cu–In metallic alloy gets richer in copper as the temperature increases and transforms from CuIn2 to Cu11In9, then Cu16In9 and finally to Cu7In3. The use of rapidly cooled samples stopped after different durations of the process along with ex-situ XRD analysis enabled us to differentiate the Cu16In9 and Cu7In3 phases. Finally, the efficiency of the solar cells made with the two-step electrodeposition and RTP low-cost process reaches 11% (active area 0.421cm2), which is close to the results obtained for cells made with PVD precursors.

Abstract: A sheet resistance- and optical transmittance-tunable amorphous ZnSnO3 (ZTO) multilayer electrode created through the insertion of a nano-scale Ag layer is demonstrated as an indium-free transparent conducting electrode for cost-efficient inverted organic solar cells (IOSCs). Due to the antireflection effect, the ZTO/Ag/ZTO/glass exhibited a high transmittance of 86.29% in the absorption wavelength region of the organic active layer and a low resistivity of 3.24×10−5Ωcm, even though the ZTO/Ag/ZTO electrode was prepared at room temperature. The metallic conductivity of the electrode indicates that its electrical conductivity is dominated by the nano-scale Ag metal layer. In addition, optimization and control of the thickness of the nano-scale Ag layer are important in obtaining highly transparent ZTO/Ag/ZTO electrodes, because antireflection is strongly influenced by Ag thickness. Moreover, IOSCs fabricated on optimized ZTO/Ag/ZTO electrodes with Ag thicknesses of 12nm showed power conversion efficiencies (2.55%) comparable to that of an IOSC prepared on a crystalline ITO electrode (2.45%), due to the low sheet resistance and high optical transmittance in the range of 400–600nm. The performances of ZTO/Ag/ZTO multilayer electrodes indicate that ZTO/Ag/ZTO multilayers are promising as indium-free, transparent electrode substitutes for conventional ITO electrodes in cost-efficient IOSCs.

Abstract: Tumor progression involves the acquisition of invasiveness through a basement membrane. The c-jun proto-oncogene is overexpressed in human tumors and has been identified at the leading edge of human breast tumors. TGF-β plays a bifunctional role in tumorigenesis and cellular migration. Although c-Jun and the activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex have been implicated in human cancer, the molecular mechanisms governing cellular migration via c-Jun and the role of c-Jun in TGF-β signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze TGF-β mediated cellular migration in mouse embryo fibroblasts using floxed c-jun transgenic mice. We compared the c-jun wild type with the c-jun knockout cells through the use of Cre recombinase. Herein, TGF-β stimulated cellular migration and intracellular calcium release requiring endogenous c-Jun. TGF-β mediated Ca2+ release was independent of extracellular calcium and was suppressed by both U73122 and neomycin, pharmacological inhibitors of the breakdown of PIP2 into IP3. Unlike TGF-β-mediated Ca2+ release, which was c-Jun dependent, ATP mediated Ca2+ release was c-Jun independent. These studies identify a novel pathway by which TGF-β regulates cellular migration and Ca2+ release via endogenous c-Jun.

Abstract: Dielectric roughness on the front surface enhances significantly solar cell efficiency by light trapping in the absorbing layer. However in plasmonic assisted thin silicon solar cells we show, by a detailed analysis of the various mechanisms, that front-surface plasmonic structures enhance the efficiency by a different mechanism—namely the effective broadband forward scattering into the silicon, while trapping (path length enhancement) is relatively small for these structures. The plasmonic local field enhancement contribution is even smaller in this configuration. Based on our study we optimized this “anti-reflection mechanism” by tuning the plasmonic structure such that the spectral location of the more efficiently scattering dipole and quadrupole resonances fit correctly the visible and NIR sun spectrum.

Abstract: We report the fabrication and investigation of the parabola-shaped periodic subwavelength grating (SWG) structures on aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) film/Si substrate, which are formed by a novel re-deposition method using the AZO dot arrays as a seed layer, for broadband and omnidirectional antireflection. For fabricated parabola-shaped AZO SWG structures, the antireflection characteristics are investigated, together with theoretical analysis based on a rigorous coupled-wave analysis method. The parabola-shaped AZO SWG structure suppresses significantly Fresnel reflections compared to the AZO film and the AZO dot arrays (or cylindrical AZO SWGs with a hemispherical top) because of its linear gradient-refractive-index change between the AZO and air. For the parabola-shaped AZO SWG/initial AZO film of 600nm after 45min re-deposition, it exhibits a low average reflectance of∼5% with a solar weighted reflectance of 5.3% while maintaining a reflectance less than 25.6% over a wide wavelength region of 300–1100nm up to the incident angle of θi=70°. The electrical properties of the fabricated AZO SWG structures are also discussed.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films have been successfully prepared by a novel synthesis process that involves a single step deposition of Cu2ZnSnS4 followed by a post-annealing treatment at 550°C for 60min in the atmosphere of N2+H2S (5%). The microstructure, morphology, composition and optical property of the film have been investigated in detail. It is found that the Na2S2O35H2O concentration in the solution has a significant effect on the Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films. X-ray diffraction data indicates that the annealed Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films have a kesterite structure with preferred orientation along the (112) plane. Uniform and compact topographies are observed in some annealed films. From the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, it can be seen that Cu-poor and Zn-rich Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films have been obtained. The direct band gap energy of the film is about 1.5eV.

Abstract: We have proposed a novel laser-assisted-deposition (LAD) process for improving the crystalline quality of CIGS thin films and cell performance. The influences of laser power, Ga content in CIGS, substrate temperature, and photon energy of laser on CIGS thin films and solar cells have been investigated. In the LAD process a pulsed excimer laser and a pulsed Nd:YAG laser were irradiated onto the substrate surface during CIGS deposition by the three-stage process. The crystalline quality of CIGS thin films and cell performance, particularly open-circuit-voltage, improved by LAD process for all ranges of Ga content and at substrate temperature ranges of 400–550°C. It was also found that the laser irradiation enhanced the diffusion of Ga into CIGS even at low substrate temperatures, which strongly affects the formation of double-graded bandgap. The PL decay time of LAD–CIGS solar cells was much longer than that of the fabricated by the three-stage process, which implies the reduced defects in CIGS absorber layer. The improved thin-film quality and cell performance became noticeable only when the laser wavelength was shorter than 266nm (4.66eV of photon energy). This result strongly suggests that the impacts of pulsed-laser irradiation are dominated by photon-energy rather than thermal-energy.

Abstract: Sol-gel SiO2 anti-reflection (AR) coating on solar glass is known to increase the current output by a few percent, but its mechanical durability is of concern. To improve its strength, the amorphous SiO2 may be replaced by zeolite, which is a microporous aluminosilicate crystalline material. Scratch-resistant AR coating has been prepared by the dip coating of a composition which contains aggregated zeolite nanoparticles as the structure provider and zeolite precursors as the reactive binder. AR coating with better than 5H pencil hardness can be made with a composition containing BEA zeolite. Nanoindenter measurements show that this BEA zeolite films have 1.5GPa indent hardness and 35GPa elastic modulus. Furthermore, the freshly prepared AR coating shows a self-cleaning effect with a water contact angle (WCA) close to zero. It can be made super-hydrophobic with larger than 130° WCA after modifying with hexamethyl-disilazane (HMDS), upon which the pencil hardness further increases to 6H.

Abstract: Here we report on organic photovoltaic's (OPV) suitable for low light applications. In this paper, we illustrate the impact of Rs and Rp for indoor and outdoor applications. In addition, we propose a simple physics approach to predict the behavior of organic solar cells under various illumination intensities through electrical modeling. The combination of simulation and modeling allows to define a set of design rules for OPVs under low light illumination. The performance of various organic solar cells under low light intensity is compared with our predictions and excellent correlation is found. OPV shows high performance under low light conditions.

Abstract: Elevated operating temperatures reduce the solar to electrical conversion efficiency of building integrated photovoltaic devices (BIPV). Phase change materials (PCM) can be used to passively limit this temperature rise although their effectiveness is limited by their low thermal conductivities and crystallisation segregation during solidification. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the effects of convection and crystalline segregation in a PCM as a function of efficiency of heat transfer within the finned PV/PCM system. The thermal performances of bulk PCM with crystallisation segregation for different internal fin arrangements are presented. It is noted that the addition of internal fins improves the temperature control of the PV in a PV/PCM system.

Abstract: Lactoferrin (Ltf), an iron binding glycoprotein, is a pleiotropic molecule whose serum concentration increases under acute phase conditions. The physiological roles of this protein have been well elucidated, but the source and serum regulation of Ltf gene expression have not been investigated in detail as part of the acute phase reaction (APR). In the current work, the changes in hepatic Ltf-gene-expression during turpentine oil- (TO-) or LPS-induced APR were investigated. Ltf was upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in the liver of TO- and LPS-treated wild type (WT) mice. The pattern of induction however was different in both animal models indicating distinctive signalling patterns resulting in an acute phase reaction. Cytokines are the core regulators of APR. Among the major cytokines, IL-6 is an important signalling molecule, which also regulates iron homeostasis in response to an inflammatory situation. In this study, the administration of IL-6 induced Ltf gene expression in the liver of WT mice, in murine hepatocytes and in hepa 1-6 cells. Ltf-gene-expression was upregulated also in the liver of TO- and LPS-treated IL-6 knockout (KO) mice. The increase in serum Ltf after LPS injection was greater than after TO-injection both in WT and IL-6-KO mice. To evaluate the contribution of other acute phase cytokines in the regulation of Ltf-gene-expression in the liver, both in vitro and in vivo studies with IL-1β, TNF-α, or IFN-γ were performed. The results demonstrate that TNF-α and IFN-γ also upregulated Ltf-gene-expression, while IL-1β has no role in the regulation of Ltf-gene-expression.

Abstract: Germanium (Ge)-doped Czochralski (GCZ) silicon has been grown for photovoltaic (PV) applications. It is found that Ge doping improves the mechanical strength of CZ silicon, resulting in the reduction of breakage during wafer cutting, cell fabrication and module assembly. Boron–oxygen (B–O) defects that lead to the light-induced degradation (LID) of carrier lifetime are effectively suppressed by Ge doping. The decrease in the maximum concentration of B–O defects increases with an increase of Ge concentration. The efficiency of GCZ silicon solar cells and the power output of corresponding PV modules both exhibit smaller loss under sunlight illumination. The current work suggests that GCZ silicon should be potentially a novel substrate for thin solar cells with low LID effect.

Abstract: Mitochondria, known to share many common features with prokaryotic cells, accumulate several endogenous ligands of the pattern-recognition Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), such as the heat shock proteins (Hsp) 70 and 60. TLR4 specifically recognises and responds to LPS of Gram-negative bacteria and participates in both autoimmune reactions and tissue regeneration due to its ability to recognise endogenous ligands. In the present study we show that mitochondria extracts obtained from hydrogen peroxide-dysfunctionalised cells induce a pro-inflammatory response in human THP-1 myeloid leukaemia cells. This inflammatory response was similar to that caused by LPS and much stronger than that induced by the extracts of normal mitochondria. Such reactions include activation of stress-adaptation hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and expression/release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. Pre-treatment of THP-1 myeloid macrophages with TLR4-neutralising antibody before exposure to mitochondria extracts or LPS attenuated the inflammatory responses. Signalling pathways recruited by TLR4 in response to LPS and mitochondria-derived ligands were found to be the same. An in vitro ELISA-based TLR4-ligand binding assay, in which the ligand-binding domain of human TLR4 was immobilised, showed that mitochondria extracts contain endogenous TLR4 ligands. These results were verified in surface plasmon resonance experiments in which the affinity of the ligands derived from dysfunctional mitochondria was comparable with that of LPS and was much higher than that observed for normal mitochondria.

Abstract: A precise numerical model based on Kirchhoff's laws is used in investigating dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) modules. As the I–V curve of a small DSC is obtained, the performances of DSC modules with any geometrical character can be exactly simulated by this model. By simulation, we find that the poor synchronization of work status in each cell is the main cause of low efficiency of large area module besides the Joule losses in the resistances. The optimized geometry parameters of the DSC module are mainly influenced by the manufacturing technique rather than the performance of the small cell. Simulation shows that the large area DSC module with aperture area efficiency of 10.57% can be produced based on the small cell with efficiency of 11.1%.

Abstract: A series of three porphyrins varying only in the steric bulk of their peripheral groups have been synthesised and integrated into the active layer of bulk heterojunction solar cells. The porphyrins broaden the spectral response of the device and contribute to the total photocurrent generated. More importantly, the device characteristics change systematically with increasing steric bulk on the peripheral meso phenyl groups of the tetra-phenyl porphyrin. Optical, scanning probe and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy are used to demonstrate that the observed changes do not arise from morphological differences in film structure. Cyclic voltammetry, UV–vis spectroscopy and DFT calculations are used to establish that the porphyrin LUMO, HOMO and bandgap are independent of side group. We conclude that the variations in open-circuit voltage with side group are the result of the porphyrin acting as a bimolecular recombination centre, with an efficiency that is dependent on the side group type. The possibility of designing optimised macromolecules for OPV devices based on an understanding the effect of porphyrin steric bulk upon device performance is discussed.

Abstract: A new solar selective coating was optimization designed in our paper. Ti0.5Al0.5N and Ti0.25Al0.75N coatings were chosen as absorber layers and AlN coating was chosen as anti-reflection layer. The phase structure and optical constants of these coatings were studied by X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic ellipsometry, respectively. The Ti0.5Al0.5N coating has a cubic NaCl-type structure and exhibits metallic character. However, the Ti0.25Al0.75N coating consists of cubic NaCl-type structure and hexagonal AlN structure and exhibits semiconducting property. AlN coating is expected as a dielectric layer. The solar selective coating was optimized using a computer program named TFCalc and verified by experimental results. The absorptance and low emittance of the optimized solar selective coating were 0.945 and 0.04 (82°C), respectively.

Abstract: A gallium-doped ZnO (GZO) layer was investigated and compared with a conventional indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layer for use as a cathode in an inverted polymer solar cell based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunctions (BHJ). By modifying the GZO cathode with a ZnO thin layer, a high power conversion efficiency (3.4%) comparable to that of an inverted solar cell employing the same P3HT:PCBM BHJ photoactive layer with a conventional ITO/ZnO cathode was achieved. This result indicates that GZO is a transparent electrode material that can potentially be used to replace high-cost ITO.

Abstract: Current–voltage (j–V) characteristics of the record-efficiency CuGaSe2 solar cell measured under several illumination levels are analyzed using a two-diode equation for a more accurate description of cell behavior. The contribution of each diode to the total cell j–V characteristic under illumination was estimated using the current separation method presented recently [1]. This is performed in an effort to identify the distinctive features of this record-efficiency cell, which have led to the up-to-date highest open circuit voltage of Voc=946mV and fill factor of FF=66.5% for CuGaSe2 solar cells. Furthermore, the interface recombination component of the cell current under illumination is quantitatively discussed applying the interface recombination model presented earlier [2].

Abstract: We use solvent additives as a simple method to tune the photovoltaic performance of poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojuncton solar cells. 1,2-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) was used as the reference solvent; chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (THN) were used as additives to influence film formation. An increase in the short circuit current and the power conversion efficiency of solar cells with blends cast from mixed solvents was observed. Blends prepared with THN, the highest boiling point solvent, resulted in the best device performance, while blends prepared with the pure reference solvent resulted in the lowest photocurrent. In-plane investigations of the morphology using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed improved phase segregation for blends prepared with mixed solvents, and increased crystallinity in the P3HT phase is demonstrated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) coupled with Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Optical modeling reveals that the increase in the photocurrent is not due to changes in the optical properties of the blends. Electrical characterization reveals that the electron mobilities decrease slightly in blends cast from mixed solvents, corresponding to a decrease in the fill factor and an increase in P3HT crystallinity observed at the surface of the blend. The increase in the photovoltaic performance is discussed in terms of increased charge separation at the donor–acceptor interface due to increased ordering in the P3HT phase induced by the solvent additives.

Abstract: In this work, in-situ transmission measurements using plasma as light source are presented for the determination of growth rate and crystallinity during silicon thin-film growth. The intensity of distinct plasma emission lines was measured at the backside of the transparent substrates on which silicon films, ranging from amorphous to microcrystalline, were deposited. Using this configuration, the growth rate of thin-films was determined with high accuracy. In addition, we show that the crystallinity of the films can be monitored in the most critical range (between 40% and 80%) for microcrystalline silicon solar cells by evaluating the intensity ratio of two transmitted wavelengths in-situ. The gradual change in the absorption behaviour of the films during the phase transition is reflected by this ratio of two wavelengths as demonstrated by the good correlation with the crystallinity fraction determined by ex-situ Raman spectroscopy. This approach of in-situ transmission spectroscopy provides an easy-to-implement monitoring and control system for the industrial deposition of thin-film silicon solar cells, as critical material properties can be determined real-time during the deposition process even on rough substrates that are optimized for light trapping in solar cells.

Abstract: Synergistic effect of the mixed phase in titania photocatalyst on its performance compared to the pristine phases has been investigated in terms of the bulk and interfacial behavior of the phases in contact. The experiments were conducted under both UV and visible light irradiations. The photoactivity variation has been correlated with the changes in the ratio of anatase to rutile phases (A/R ratio), and their unique response to UV and visible radiations. For this, a set of pure (rutile or anatase) and mixed phases (with varying A/R ratio) titania nanoparticles were synthesized. The physico-chemical characterization was done using SEM, XRD, EDAX, UV-DRS, PL and FTIR analyses. The activity of catalysts in UV and visible light was investigated by monitoring the degradation of phenol. The results show that the mixed phase catalysts show enhanced photoactivity compared to pristine phases across the irradiation wavelength range. Further, the catalysts having a narrow range of high A/R ratio (>1) around 5.0 show high UV activity while those having low A/R ratio (<1) around 0.5 show high visible light activity. A mechanism is proposed based on the influence of interfacial phenomena under both UV and visible light irradiations. It explains the differences observed in the behavior of the catalyst irradiated with UV and visible light and also the high activity of mixed phase catalysts compared to the pristine phases across the wavelength ranges.

Chaotic neovascularization induced by aggressive fibrosarcoma cells overexpressing S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase,

Abstract: S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines essential for cell proliferation. Overexpression of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase in rodent fibroblasts led to aggressive transformants (Amdc-s cells) that had unforeseen high invasive capacity in nude mice, invading rapidly from the subcutaneous injection site into the peritoneal cavity and its organs. In vitro, these cells were much more invasive than Ras-oncogene-transformed fibroblasts, or human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. In immunohistological characterization, Amdc-s-induced tumors showed chaotic neovascularization, with abundant pleomorphic vessel-like structures that had noncontiguous or totally missing laminin (basement membrane) and CD31 (endothelial cell) immunoreactivity. Gene expression and protein analyses of Amdc-s cells showed them to overexpress several pro-angiogenic molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), and to exhibit profound down-regulation of the anti-angiogenic thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). By reintroduction of TSP-1 into Amdc-s cells, the high invasiveness was efficiently inhibited in vitro. Interestingly, Amdc-s cells showed up-regulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and also expressed the MET receptor, creating thus an autocrine loop able to regulate VEGF-A and TSP-1 levels. Further, we found Amdc-s cells to express increased amounts of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and the large isoform of tenascin-C (TN-C), which may also contribute to the angiogenic switch and invasiveness. Consequently, Amdc-s cells offer an excellent model to sort out the key molecules of aggressive tumor growth, and thereby help in designing rational, novel anti-vascular and other cancer therapies.

Abstract: Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) has been implicated in tumor metastasis yet its function in melanoma progression remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that stably silencing NCAM expression in mouse melanoma B16F0 cells perturbs their cellular invasion and metastatic dissemination in vivo. The pro-invasive function of NCAM is exerted via dual mechanisms involving both cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Pharmacologic inhibition of PKA and PI3K leads to impaired cellular invasion. In contrast, forced expression of constitutively activated Akt, the major downstream target of PI3K, restores the defective cellular invasiveness of NCAM knock-down (KD) B16F0 cells. Furthermore, attenuation of either PKA or Akt activity in NCAM KD cells is shown to affect their common downstream target, transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which in turn down-regulates mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), thus contributes to impaired cellular invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells. Together, these findings indicate that NCAM potentiates cellular invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells through stimulation of PKA and PI3K signaling pathways thus suggesting the potential implication of anti-NCAM strategy in melanoma treatment.

Abstract: We have earlier introduced the power law equation, j=1−(1−γ)v−γvm, where j=J/Jsc and v=V/V∝, to simplify determination of the J–V curve, fill-factor and peak power point of an illuminated solar cell from a few measurements as well as physical parameters. However, the validity of the various formulae and parameter extraction procedure was established for a limited class of cells, having moderately convex J–V curves with fill-factors of 0.56–0.77 and obeying single exponential theory with bias independent photocurrent. This paper presents a thorough validation of the model proposed earlier. New formulae and parameter extraction procedure are presented to extend the applicability of the power law equation to a much wider variety of cells. The J–V curves considered in this paper range from concave (fill-factor<0.25) to highly convex (fill-factor>0.85), and their theoretical expressions contain bias dependent photocurrent and double exponential terms. It is shown that the power law equation also simplifies the calculation of the cell bias point for an arbitrary load.

Abstract: A new fullerene derivative, biindene-C70 monoadduct (BC70MA), was synthesized by [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between 1,1′-biindene and C70, for the application as acceptor in polymer solar cells (PSCs). BC70MA is soluble in common organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, toluene, o-dichlorobenzene, etc., and shows stronger absorption in the visible region and a slightly up-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level than that of PCBM. PSCs were fabricated with BC70MA as acceptor and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as donor for investigating the photovoltaic properties of BC70MA. The power conversion efficiency of the PSC based on P3HT/BC70MA (1:1, w/w) with the additive of 3% octane-1,8-dithiol and thermal annealing at 110°C for 10min reached 3.44% with open circuit voltage of 0.64V, short circuit current of 8.02mA/cm2 and fill-factor of 0.67, under the illumination of AM1.5, 100mW/cm2.

Abstract: Inverted organic photovoltaic devices with a structure of fluorine tin oxide (FTO)/ZnO/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Ag were fabricated, in which ZnO interlayer serves as an electron selective layer. The ZnO interlayer includes three different nanostructures: polycrystalline seed layer, polycrystalline seed layer/loose nanopillars and polycrystalline seed layer/dense nanopillars. The influences of the different ZnO interlayers on the device performance were investigated. It is concluded that the polycrystalline seed layer/loose nanopillars offer more interfacial area with the P3HT:PCBM blends and acts as a continuous conducting path to the cathode. Our results demonstrate that effective infiltration of the blends into the ZnO nanopillars is critical for optimizing the device performance.

Abstract: Micro-cracks in wafer based silicon solar cell modules are nowadays identified by a human observer with the electroluminescence (EL) method. However, the essential question of how the micro-cracks affect the PV module performance has yet to be answered. We experimentally analyze the direct impact of micro-cracks on the module power and the consequences after artificial aging. We show that the immediate effect of micro-cracks on the module power is small, whereas the presence of micro-cracks is potentially crucial for the performance of the module after artificial ageing. This confirms the necessity to develop the means of quantifying the risk of power loss in PV modules with cracked solar cells in their lifetime, in order to enable manufacturers to discard defective modules with high risk of failure while keeping modules with uncritical micro-cracks. As a first step towards risk estimation we develop an upper bound for the potential power loss of PV modules due to micro-cracks in the solar cells. This is done by simulating the impact of inactive solar cell fragments on the power of a common PV module type and PV array. We show that the largest inactive cell area of a double string protected by a bypass diode is most relevant for the power loss of the PV module. A solar cell with micro-cracks, which separate a part of less than 8% of the cell area, results in no power loss in a PV module or a PV module array for all practical cases. In between approximately 12 and 50% of inactive area of a single cell in the PV module the power loss increases nearly linearly from zero to the power of one double string.

Abstract: A new cell concept has been developed that enables epitaxial c-Si thin-film solar cells to be made using isolating substrates. The Recrystallised Wafer-Equivalent on an Isolating Substrate (RexWISe) cell concept relies on an array of mini-silicon rods through the substrate to enable standard contacting. Processing techniques have been developed to produce the rods by drilling holes through the substrate, coating the holes with an intermediate layer, filling the holes with a seeding layer deposition and then recrystallising the seeding layer. Subsequently, the active layers of the cell are epitaxially grown onto the recrystallised layer and then this “Wafer-Equivalent” structure is metallised like a standard wafer solar cell. The first solar cells have been produced to test the RexWISe process and a “proof-of-concept” efficiency of almost 8% was achieved.

Abstract: A new model is developed by combining the optical model and the drift-diffusion model to optimize the thicknesses of active layers of individual sub-cells for high performance of organic tandem solar cell. When the photovoltaic properties of tandem organic solar cells based on poly(2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta (2,1–b;3,4–b′) dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzo-thiadiazole))/(6,6)-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester and poly(3-hexylthiophene)/(6,6)-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester are calculated as functions of thicknesses of individual sub-cells using the new model, it is found that the optimum thickness pair of active layers is 150 and 120nm for the front and back sub-cell, respectively. Comparison of simulation with experiment reveals that the simulated results are very consistent with experimental ones.

Abstract: In this paper, we reported a simple method to increase the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester derivatives blended active layer. The approach includes insertion of a discotic liquid crystal [2,3,6,7,10,11]-Hexabutoxytriphenylene (HAT4) at the interface between the active layer and a hole transporting layer. HAT4 molecules distribute in the active layer to form a more efficient pass way for carriers leading to improve the charge mobility. The experiments also included different hole transporting layers (HTLs) (PEDOT:PSS, MoO3 and NiO) deposited on fluorine-tin oxide substrates, respectively. The results showed that both short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF) were increased without open-circuit voltage sacrifice. Maximum 43% increase in PCE with the insertion of HAT4 for three kinds of HTLs was obtained in the devices compared with that of the reference ones. The mechanisms behind JSC and FF increase are discussed.

Abstract: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is an ectopeptidase with multiple physiological roles including the degradation of incretins, and a target of therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Divalent cations can inhibit its activity, but there has been little effort to understand how they act. The intact membrane-bound form of porcine kidney dipeptidyl peptidase IV was purified by a simple and fast procedure. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide with an average Vmax of 1.397±0.003μmolmin−1mL−1, kcat of 145.0±1.2s−1, KM of 0.138±0.005mM and kcat/KM of 1050mM−1s−1. The enzyme was inhibited by bacitracin, tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and by the dipeptidyl peptidase IV family inhibitor l-threo-Ile-thiazolidide (Ki 70nM). The enzyme was inhibited by the divalent ions Ca2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Hg2+ and Zn2+, following kinetic mechanisms of mixed inhibition, with Ki values of 2.04×10−1, 2.28×10−2, 4.21×10−4, 8.00×10−5 and 2.95×10−5M, respectively. According to bioinformatic tools, Ca2+ ions preferentially bound to the β-propeller domain of the porcine enzyme, while Zn2+ ions to the α-β hydrolase domain; the binding sites were strikingly conserved in the human enzyme and other homologues. The functional characterization indicates that porcine and human homologues have very similar functional properties. Knowledge about the mechanisms of action of divalent cations may facilitate the design of new inhibitors.

Abstract: We report on a facile low temperature method for the preparation of high surface area, nanostructured α-Fe2O3 (hematite) thin films and their application as photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting electrodes. The hematite films are fabricated by thermal oxidation in air of DC sputter deposited iron films at temperatures as low as 255°C. This method results in films with a higher surface area than typically obtained by directly sputtering α-Fe2O3. It is shown that beyond a minimum iron thickness, α-Fe2O3 nanowires result upon thermal treatment in atmospheric conditions. Structural and optical characteristics of the resulting films are analyzed. The oxidation process is studied in detail and correlated to the photoelectrical properties. The Fe films oxidize in stages via Fe-oxide layers of increasing oxidation states. Resulting photoelectrochemical performance of fully oxidized films is a balance between optical absorption and charge collection, which varies with film thickness. The optimum film achieved a net photocurrent density of 0.18mA/cm2 in 1M NaOH at 1.23V vs. RHE under simulated AM1.5 sunlight, amongst the highest values reported for undoped hematite films produced at low temperature.

Abstract: Indium tin oxide (ITO)-free organic solar cells were fabricated with highly conductive and transparent tosylate-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene: p-toluene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PTS) anodes of various thicknesses that were prepared by the vapor-phase oxidative polymerization of EDOT using Fe(PTS)3 as an oxidant. Both solution-processable layers – PEDOT:PSS and photoactive P3HT:PCBM – were spin coated. The anodes transmittance and conductivity varied with thickness. Power conversion efficiency was maximized at 1.4%. The ITO-free organic solar cells photovoltaic characteristics are qualitatively compared with those of ITO-based organic solar cells to explore the possibility of replacing costly, vacuum-deposited ITO with highly conductive, patterned polymer films fabricated by inexpensive vapor-phase polymerization.

Abstract: A series of layered perovskite photocatalysts, ASr2TaxNb3−xO10 (A=K, H; x=0, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3), were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction followed by an ion-exchange reaction. Pt was incorporated in the interlayer of HSr2TaxNb3−xO10 by the stepwise intercalation reaction. The HSr2TaxNb3−xO10 showed hydrogen production activity and the activities were greatly enhanced by Pt co-incorporating. The x value in HSr2TaxNb3−xO10 had an important effect on the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. When the x=1, the HSr2TaNb2O10/Pt photocatalyst showed a photocatalytic activity of 208cm3g−1h−1 hydrogen evolution rate in 10vol% methanol solution under irradiation with wavelength more than 290nm from a 100-W mercury lamp at 333K. The HSr2TaNb2O10/Pt photocatalyst exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity than the well-known TiO2/Pt photocatalyst under the same conditions.

Abstract: P–i–n type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells were deposited by the radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD) process at a low substrate temperature of 125°C, which is compatible with low-cost poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic substrates. Wide band gap (Eopt>1.88eV) intrinsic a-Si:H films were achieved before the onset of the microcrystalline regime by changing the hydrogen dilution ratios. On the other hand, the structural, optical and electrical properties of p-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (p-a-SiC:H) window layers have been optimized at 125°C. High quality p-a-SiC:H film with high optical band gap (E04=2.02eV) and high conductivity (σd=1.0×10−7S/cm) was deposited at ‘low-power regime’ under low silane flow rates and high H2 dilution conditions. With the combination of wide band gap p-a-SiC:H window layers and intrinsic a-Si:H layers, a high Voc of 1.01V (efficiency=5.51%, FF=0.72, Jsc=7.58mA/cm2) was obtained for single junction a-Si:H p–i–n solar cell at a low temperature of 125°C. Finally, flexible a-Si:H solar cell on PET substrate with efficiency of 4.60% (Voc=0.98V, FF=0.69, Jsc=6.82mA/cm2) was obtained.

Abstract: Caveolin-3 is the striated muscle specific isoform of the scaffolding protein family of caveolins and has been shown to interact with a variety of proteins, including ion channels. Mutations in the human CAV3 gene have been associated with several muscle disorders called caveolinopathies and among these, the P104L mutation (Cav-3P104L) leads to limb girdle muscular dystrophy of type 1C characterized by the loss of sarcolemmal caveolin. There is still no clear-cut explanation as to specifically how caveolin-3 mutations lead to skeletal muscle wasting. Previous results argued in favor of a role for caveolin-3 in dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) functional regulation and/or T-tubular membrane localization. It appeared worth closely examining such a functional link and investigating if it could result from the direct physical interaction of the two proteins. Transient expression of Cav-3P104L or caveolin-3 specific siRNAs in C2C12 myotubes both led to a significant decrease of the L-type Ca2+ channel maximal conductance. Immunolabeling analysis of adult skeletal muscle fibers revealed the colocalization of a pool of caveolin-3 with the DHPR within the T-tubular membrane. Caveolin-3 was also shown to be present in DHPR-containing triadic membrane preparations from which both proteins co-immunoprecipitated. Using GST-fusion proteins, the I–II loop of Cav1.1 was identified as the domain interacting with caveolin-3, with an apparent affinity of 60nM. The present study thus revealed a direct molecular interaction between caveolin-3 and the DHPR which is likely to underlie their functional link and whose loss might therefore be involved in pathophysiological mechanisms associated to muscle caveolinopathies.

Abstract: Quantitative information regarding the maximum power point (MPP) of photovoltaic (PV) arrays is crucial for determining and controlling their operation, yet it is difficult to obtain such information through direct measurements. PV arrays exhibit an extremely nonlinear current–voltage (I–V) characteristic that varies with many complex factors related to the individual cells, which makes it difficult to ensure an optimal use of the available solar energy and to achieve maximum power output in real time. Finding ways to obtain the maximum power output in real time under all possible system conditions are indispensable to the development of feasible PV generation systems. The conventional methods for tracking the MPP of PV arrays suffer from a serious problem that the MPP cannot be quickly acquired. Based on the p–n junction semiconductor theory, we develop a prediction method for directly estimating the MPP for power tracking in PV arrays. The proposed method is a new and simple approach with a low calculation burden that takes the resistance effect of the solar cells into consideration. The MPP of PV arrays can be directly determined from an irradiated I–V characteristic curve. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by examining the characteristics of the MPP of PV arrays depending on both the temperature and irradiation intensity, and the results are discussed in detail. Such performance is also tested using the field data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method helps in the optimization of the MPP control model in PV arrays.

Abstract: We present results of an experimental investigation of the effects of the daily spectral variation on the device performance of copper indium diselenide and multi-crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules. Such investigations are of importance in characterization of photovoltaic devices. The investigation centres on the analysis of outdoor solar spectral measurements carried out at 10min intervals on clear-sky days. We have shown that the shift in the solar spectrum towards infrared has a negative impact on the device performance of both modules. The spectral bands in the visible region contribute more to the short circuit current than the bands in the infrared region while the ultraviolet region contributes least. The quantitative effects of the spectral variation on the performance of the two photovoltaic modules are reflected on their respective device performance parameters. The decrease in the visible and the increase in infrared of the late afternoon spectra in each case account for the decreased current collection and hence power and efficiency of both modules.

Abstract: We report the electrical properties of inverted P3HT:PC71BM bulk hetero-junction (IBHJ) with Cs2CO3 and MoO3 interlayers. The current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of the inverted P3HT:PC71BM bulk hetero-junction solar cells are studied, where MoO3 thickness is varied from 0.5 to 2nm. The temperature independent, symmetric J–V characteristics in dark were found in the low bias voltage region between −0.35 and 0.35V, and they exhibited the power law relationship J–V1.2 when the MoO3 thickness is between 1 and 2nm. Open-circuit voltages at various light intensities of the IBHJ cell plotted as a function of absolute temperature converge to ∼0.965V at zero temperature, which is very close to the energy difference between LUMO of PC71BM and HOMO of P3HT.

Abstract: The spray Ion Layer Gas Reaction (ILGAR) process starts with ultrasonic nebulisation of the precursor solution, e.g. InCl3/ethanol for our successful buffer material In2S3. In an aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) type reaction an In(O,OH,Cl) film is deposited on a heated substrate and is subsequently converted to In2S3 by H2S gas. The cycle of these steps is repeated until the required layer thickness is obtained. The robust and reproducible process allows a wide control of composition and morphology. Results of this “spray-ILGAR” method with respect to process, material properties and its application depositing the buffer layer in chalcopyrite solar cells are reviewed. New aspects such as the investigation of the complex chemical mechanism by mass spectrometry, the process acceleration by the addition of H2S gas to the aerosol, the controlled deposition of ZnS nano-dot films and finally the latest achievements in process up-scaling are also included. Solar cells based on industrial Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 absorbers (Avancis GmbH) with a Spray-ILGAR In2S3 buffer reached 14.7% efficiency (certified) and 15.3% with a ZnS/In2S3 bi-layer buffer comparable to reference cells using standard CdS buffer layers deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD). The quasi-dry, vacuum-free ILGAR method for In2S3 buffer layers is well suited for industrial in-line production and is capable of not only replacing the standard buffer material (the toxic CdS) but also the often slow CBD process. A tape coater for 10cm wide steel tape was constructed. It was shown that In2S3 layers could be produced with an indium yield better than 30% and a linear production speed of 1m/min. A roll-to-roll pilot production line for electrochemically deposited Cu(In,Ga)Se2 with ILGAR buffer is running in industry (CIS-Solartechnik, Hamburg). A 30x30cm2 prototype of an ILGAR in-line coater developed by Singulus and Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin is currently being optimised. First 30×30cm2 encapsulated modules achieved efficiencies up to 13.0% (CdS buffered reference 13.3%).

Abstract: Material property differences are observed in hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) thin films deposited under the same nominal conditions in a single-chamber plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system but at different stages of chamber history during prolonged usage. This phenomenon is called system shift, which results from the increase of powder coverage on the surface of the cathode and the coatings on other areas in the chamber. We propose a pre-hydrogen glow method to suppress the system shifting. Experimental results show that this method is very effective to reduce the non-reproducibility in μc-Si:H depositions for prolonged usage of the deposition system. In addition, the μc-Si:H films deposited with the pre-hydrogen glow have an improved structural homogeneity along the film thickness.

Abstract: Human multidrug and toxic compound extrusion 2 (hMATE2) is a kidney-specific isoform of hMATE1, an exporter of toxic organic cations (OCs) of exogenous and endogenous origins at the final excretion step in the kidneys and liver (Otsuka et al., 2005), and contains a splicing variant, MATE2K, that has an exon of hMATE2 deleted (Masuda et al., 2006). In the present study, we characterized the degree of expression and the transport properties of hMATE2. Quantitative PCR analysis with probes specific for hMATE2 indicated the presence of hMATE2 mRNA in the kidneys, which corresponded to 39% of total mRNA encoding both hMATE2 and hMATE2K. hMATE2-specific antibodies immunostained the renal urinary tubules. Upon expression in HEK293 cells, hMATE2 was localized in intracellular vesicular structures, and thus transport activity of tetraethylammonium (TEA), a typical substrate for MATE transporters, by the cells was not detected. The hMATE2 protein was purified and reconstituted into liposomes. An artificially imposed pH gradient (ΔpH) across the proteoliposomal membrane drove the uptake of TEA. Dissipation of ΔpH by ammonium sulfate effectively inhibited the TEA uptake, while that of the membrane potential by valinomycin had little effect. The profiles of cis-inhibition of TEA transport by hMATE2 and hMATE2K are similar to each other. Thus, both hMATE2 and hMATE2K equally operate in the human kidneys to extrude OCs into the urine.

Abstract: Two series of novel quinacridone (QA) based materials that combined a strong absorption over a broad range in visible region with good electrical characteristics, which were used as the new electron-accepting materials for organic solar cells, are explored. Unique cyclic compounds 1–6 are synthesized by incorporating electron withdrawing groups (CN, COOH) at carbonyl position of alkyl substituted quinacridones, which lead to the compounds possessing the characteristics of solution-processed and being suitable for photovoltaic applications. Heterojunction solar cells with simple device configuration using these soluble materials as acceptor and effective donor poly (3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) were fabricated. The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved in the solar cell based on compound 5 is 0.42% under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation with Jsc=1.80mAcm−2, Voc=0.50V and FF=47%. Although the aimed devices just exhibit moderate PCE, our results clearly suggest that the new-type electron-accepting materials different from fullerene have great potential as acceptor in heterojunction solar cell due to many advantages of the QA derivatives such as relatively inexpensive, good electrochemical stability and could be readily modified.

Abstract: Cardiac fibroblast hyperplasia associated with augmented matrix production is central to wound healing following myocardial injury. Regulation of the cardiac fibroblast cell cycle by factors in the diseased myocardium that can potentially modify the hyperplastic response of cardiac fibroblasts has, however, not been investigated. We examined the regulation of the cardiac fibroblast cell cycle by hypoxia, a major constituent of myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in DNA synthesis and cell number, and flow cytometry indicated decreased G1/S progression in hypoxic adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. Western blot analysis showed reduced levels of cyclin D and cyclin A, induction of p27 and hypophosphorylation of Rb under hypoxia. Skp2, which targets p27 for degradation, was significantly lower and inversely related to p27 protein levels in hypoxic cells. Marked p38 MAPK activation was observed under hypoxia and its inhibition using SB203580 reversed the effects of hypoxia on DNA synthesis, cell cycle phase distribution, p27, and cyclin D1 but not cyclin A. Interestingly, a 2-fold increase in p27 mRNA in hypoxic cells, demonstrated by real-time PCR, was unaffected by SB203580, which, however, reversed the hypoxic inhibition of Skp2. In summary, p38 MAPK is an important determinant of hypoxia-induced G0/G1 block in cardiac fibroblasts. p27 induction in hypoxic cardiac fibroblasts may involve direct transcriptional regulation, independent of p38 MAPK, and post-translational regulation via p38 MAPK-dependent suppression of its degradation by Skp2. The study identifies Skp2 as a potential downstream target of p38 MAPK, suggesting a novel mechanism of G1-S regulation in cardiac fibroblasts exposed to stress conditions.

Abstract: α-Synuclein (α-syn), a protein involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), is known to accumulate in mitochondria, disrupt mitochondrial function. However, the molecular mechanisms that link these pathological responses have not been investigated. In rats overexpressing α-syn in the substantia nigra (SN) through adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction, about 50% of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons were lost after 24 weeks. Overexpression of α-syn was also associated with morphological deformation of mitochondria and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Both co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy demonstrated that mitochondrial α-syn associated with adenylate translocator (ANT), a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). The depolarization of ΔΨm was partially reversed in vitro by bongkrekic acid (BKA), an inhibitor of ANT, suggesting that the molecular association between α-syn and ANT facilitated ΔΨm depolarization. Concomitant with α-syn accumulation in mitochondria, abnormal mitochondrial morphology, ΔΨm depolarization, and loss of TH-positive neurons, there was a decrease in apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) within the mitochondrial matrix, suggesting possible translocation to the cytosol. Our findings suggest that overexpression of α-syn may cause mitochondrial defects in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra through an association with adenylate translocator and activation of mitochondria-dependent cell death pathways. Disruption of normal mitochondrial function may contribute to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon–germanium–carbide (a-SiGeC:H) thin films have been fabricated by very high frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (VHF-PECVD) using monomethyl germane (MMG, GeH3CH3) as the germanium source. It was found that C incorporation into the films was considerably suppressed under high hydrogen dilution (RH) and substrate temperature (TS). Under high RH and TS, we were able to narrow the optical band gap (Eopt) of a-SiGeC:H thin films to 1.39eV, whereas under low RH and TS, Eopt increased up to 1.9eV with increasing MMG. The best electrical properties were obtained for a sample of a-Si0.68Ge0.29C0.03:H, whose Eopt and photosensitivity were 1.58eV and 105, respectively. When this film was used as an absorber layer in a p–i–n structured solar cell, significant enhancements were observed in its quantum efficiency for long wavelengths.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on ZnO:B layers as an alternative TCO for application on a-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction solar cells. First, the optimization of the material has been done in terms of optical and electrical properties. We have also studied the behaviour of ZnO:B against ageing. Finally, complete heterojunction solar cells have been fabricated with different back-side TCO configurations to understand the ageing mechanisms and to deeply study the influence of degradation on the solar cells parameters. Stable efficiencies up to 16.6% on polished n-type c-Si were obtained on 25cm2 heterojunction solar cells fabricated at low temperatures.

Abstract: Oxidative stress with reactive oxygen species (ROS) can contribute to the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Antioxidant enzymes, such as extracellular superoxide dismutase (ECSOD), may modulate the injury and repair components of the fibrogenic response. Here we determined whether ECSOD could attenuate experimental TGF-β1-induced persistent lung fibrosis. In this study, primary human lung fibroblasts, MRC-5 fibroblasts and A549 epithelial cells were exposed to recombinant active TGF-β1. An adenovirus vector that expresses human ECSOD (AdECSOD) was constructed and rats were endotracheally intubated with an adenoviral vector encoding active TGF-β1 (AdTGF-β1), AdECSOD or a control vector (AdDL70) alone or in combinations AdTGF-β1/AdDL70 or AdTGF-β1/AdECSOD. TGF-β1 alone induced fibrotic responses and significantly down-regulated endogenous ECSOD gene expression both in vitro and in vivo and caused oxidative stress in rat lung, associated with increased levels of activated TGF-β1 in lung fluid and tissue. ECSOD protein was markedly reduced in the interstitium and fibrotic foci in TGF-β1 induced experimental lung fibrosis. The fibrotic response caused by AdTGF-β1 was markedly attenuated by concomitant gene transfer using AdECSOD, detected by lung function measurements, histologic and morphometric analysis, hydroxyproline content and fibrosis-related gene expression. In addition, the oxidative stress and increased presence of activated TGF-β1 in rat lung induced by AdTGF-β1 was significantly reduced by ECSOD gene transfer. These findings suggest a substantial role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of TGF-β1 driven persistent pulmonary fibrosis and enhanced presence of ECSOD can inhibit latent TGF-β1 activation by ROS and diminish subsequent fibrotic responses.

Abstract: Bulk heterojunction solar cells utilizing soluble phthalocyanine derivative, 1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-octahexylphthalocyanine (C6PcH2) have been investigated. The active layer was fabricated by spin-coating the mixed solution of C6PcH2 and 1-(3-methoxy-carbonyl)-propyl-1-1-phenyl-(6,6)C61 (PCBM). The photovoltaic properties of the solar cell with bulk heterojunction of C6PcH2 and PCBM demonstrated the strong dependence of active layer thickness, and the optimized active layer thickness was clarified to be 120nm. By inserting MoO3 hole transport buffer layer between the positive electrode and active layer, the FF and energy conversion efficiency were improved to be 0.50 and 3.2%, respectively. The tandem organic thin-film solar cell has also been studied by utilizing active layer materials of C6PcH2 and poly(3-hexylthiophene) and the interlayer of LiF/Al/MoO3 structure, and a high Voc of 1.27V has been achieved.

Abstract: Apoptosis induced by low potassium (K5) or staurosporine in cerebellar granule neurons triggers an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. ROS inhibition by antioxidants or inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity reduces the apoptosis induced by both stimuli. It has been reported that JNK mediates the apoptosis induced by K5 but not by staurosporine. No information is available about the role of other signaling pathways such as p38 in staurosporine-induced apoptosis, and whether p38 activation could be related to ROS levels induced by both K5 and staurosporine. Here, we explored this possibility and found that K5 activates p38 and ATF2 and that the inhibition of p38 activity prevents the apoptosis induced by this treatment. We also found that p38 is downstream of ROS generation induced by K5. On the other hand, staurosporine promotes a sustained activation of p38. We found that p38 inhibition markedly decreases ROS generation, NOX activity and apoptosis induced by staurosporine. Furthermore, antioxidants inhibit p38 activation induced by staurosporine. These data indicate that apoptosis induced by both K5 and staurosporine is dependent on p38 activation, which is mediated by ROS. In addition, p38 activation by staurosporine induces a further production of ROS through NOX activation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Bendamustine has been recently approved for the treatment of low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders. There is little data on the effectiveness or toxicity of this drug outside the trial setting. This is the first report on the use of bendamustine from the Indian subcontinent.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN
Retrospective descriptive analysis of response and side effects of bendamustine in eight patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and eight patients with follicular lymphoma.
METHODS
Data was collated from a review of case records. We examined any association between side effects and clinical parameters.
RESULTS
The median age of patients was 52 years and three-quarters had received prior treatment with alkylators or fludarabine. Three different protocols of bendamustine were used (single agent, in combination with rituximab or in combination with vincristine and prednisolone). The overall response rate was 80% (47% complete response, 33% partial response, and 20% progressive disease). The drug was well tolerated with very few grade 3/4 toxicities. More than half the patients (9/16) developed a characteristic erythematous, papular skin rash that resolved after completion of chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION
Bendamustine is a safe and useful addition to the drug arsenal against lymphoproliferative disorders. A peculiar skin rash was the commonest side effect noted in Indian patients treated with this drug.

Abstract: Polymer-based solar cells with aluminum (Al) cathode often suffer from degradation in air. Here the study focuses on the degradation mechanism at the interface between Al and organic active layer. By performing interface modification combined with electrical and chemical characterization, it is demonstrated that the rapid degradation originates from the formation of a charge blocking layer between evaporated Al cathode and organic active layer. Insertion of a thin interfacial layer of thermally evaporated CrOx between organic active layer and Al cathode can greatly improve the device stability. It is found that the CrOx interfacial layer functions as a protective layer by stopping or minimizing penetration of thermally evaporated Al into the active layer to form a diffused organic–Al interface, which will then result in a large oxidized interfacial area upon air exposure.

Abstract: A series of polyol acetal derivatives were synthesized through condensation reactions of aromatic aldehyde with polyols, including sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, and pentaerythritol. They were examined as gelators in the formation of paraffin-based shape-stabilized phase change materials (PCMs), in which 1,3:2,4-di-(4-methyl) benzylidene sorbitol (MDBS) exhibited excellent thermal stability. Three-dimensional netted structural phase change materials were obtained by paraffin doped with different gelators, which were thermally stable so that no leakage of paraffin occurs even under higher temperature than the melting point of paraffin. It was found that PCMs doped with 3wt% expanded and exfoliated graphite (EG) exhibited better thermal conductivity, similar phase change temperature and heat storage density.

Klf10 induces cell apoptosis through modulation of BI-1 expression and Ca2+ homeostasis in estrogen-responding adenocarcinoma cells,

Abstract: Estrogen stimulates cell growth and inhibits apoptosis through estrogen receptor-mediated mechanisms in many cell types. Remarkably, there is another dimension to estrogen action by which apoptosis is induced in breast cancer cells. While these mechanisms are not yet completely understood, finding the molecules involved has paved the way for the development of a new drug group. Using ChIP-chip, we have demonstrated that Klf10, a Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor, which was induced in response to estrogen, directly modulates the transcription of BI-1 (Bax inhibitor-1; also called the testis-enhanced gene transcript, TEGT). Eventually, the estrogen induced Klf10 and then suppresses BI-1 transcription. The estrogen/Klf10/BI-1 interrelationship was further confirmed using BI-1 promoter and EMSA assays. The estrogen-elicited reduction of BI-1 promoter activity was significantly reversed when the Klf10 binding element was mutated to abolish Klf10 binding. A si-Klf10 antisense-oligo nucleotide was also able to restore BI-1 promoter activity to its pre-estrogen-treatment level. BI-1 is known to regulate stress via the endoplasmic reticulum; in this context down-regulation of BI-1 is able to cause Ca2+ release and trigger an apoptosis pathway in breast cancer. In our study, Klf10 not only suppressed cellular BI-1 expression but also increased the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, eventually causing apoptotic cell death. Based on these results, we suggest the pathway by which estrogen induces apoptosis is possibly through an up-regulation of Klf10 that decreases BI-1 and finally increases the concentration of cytoplasmic calcium.

Abstract: TvCP39 is a 39kDa cysteine proteinase (CP) involved in Trichomonas vaginalis cytotoxicity that has been found in vaginal secretions and is immunogenic in patients with trichomonosis. The goal of this work was to identify, clone, express, and characterize the tvcp39 gene. The tvcp39 gene was identified using a proteomic approach, and the complete gene was amplified using PCR, cloned, and sequenced. TvCP39 is encoded by a 915-bp cathepsin L-like CP gene. A fragment corresponding to the mature region (TvCP39r) was expressed, purified, and used to produce rabbit polyclonal antibodies and in functional assays. In one- and two-dimensional western blot assays, the anti-TvCP39r antibody reacted with two protein bands of ∼28 and 27kDa and three spots of ∼28, 27, and 24kDa in trichomonad proteinase-rich extracts that could correspond to the mature and processed fragments of the TvCP39 peptidase. The anti-TvCP39r antibody reacted with the parasitic surface and the native TvCP39 present in vaginal washes from patients with trichomonosis. Moreover, the recombinant TvCP39 protein bound to the surface of HeLa cells and protected HeLa cell monolayers from trichomonal destruction in a concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, our data support TvCP39 as one of the surface proteinases that is glycosylated and is involved in trichomonal cytotoxicity. Thus, TvCP39 is the first glycosylated cysteine proteinase detected in T. vaginalis.

Abstract: The photoreductive degradation of carbon tetrachloride (CT) in natural sphalerite ((Zn, Fe)S mineral) suspensions irradiated by visible light (VL) is studied in this paper. 92% of CT is degraded in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) organic solvent system after 8h of VL irradiation. The effects of light source, sphalerite dosage, electron donors, dissolved oxygen and CT initial concentration on CT photocatalytic degradation efficiency are discussed. The degradation products are analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and the photocatalytic degradation mechanism is then proposed.

Abstract: The atomic structure of the potential photovoltaic materials Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) is discussed on the basis of a structural analysis of neutron powder diffraction data refined by the Rietveld analysis. Both compounds were found to crystallize in the kesterite type structure, but with a disorder within the Cu–Zn layers at z=1/4 and 3/4. The latter causes CuZn and ZnCu anti-site defects, whose concentration depends on the sample growth conditions. The temperature dependent structural phase transition in CZTS was studied by in-situ high temperature diffraction experiments using high energy synchrotron X-rays. The transition from the tetragonal kesterite to the cubic sphalerite type structure is discussed by means of the interplay of increasing and decreasing cation–anion–cation bond angles in the coordination tetrahedra, reflected by the shift of the anion atomic coordinates to more ideal (x and y) or non-ideal (z) values. This striking behavior may be connected with frustrations that occur due to the triangular geometry of the coordination tetrahedra.

Abstract: Highly aluminum-doped p-type silicon regions are formed by in-line high-rate evaporation of aluminum. We deposit aluminum layers of 28μm thickness at dynamic deposition rates of 20μm×m/min on p-type silicon substrates. Due to the high substrate temperature of up to 770°C during deposition an Al-doped p+ region is formed. Using the camera-based dynamic infrared lifetime mapping technique we measure emitter saturation current densities of 695±65fA/cm2 for the fully metalized Al-p+ regions, which corresponds to an implied solar cell open-circuit voltage of 635±2mV.

Abstract: Utilization of 2,2-dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole has received strong attention as the electron-deficient unit for the generation of electron donor material for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). This paper reports the first small organic molecules based on dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole, which can produce intramolecular charge transfer. Two soluble small organic molecules, MMM and OMO, with dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole unit were synthesized by Suzuki coupling reaction with Pd(0)-catalyst. The spectra of MMM and OMO in the solid thin films show absorption bands with maximum peaks at 374, 598 and 373, 588nm, and the absorption onsets at 678 and 673nm, corresponding to band gaps of 1.83 and 1.84eV, respectively. The devices comprising MMM with PC61BM (1:3) showed a VOC of 0.66V, a JSC of 2.03mA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.27, giving a power-conversion efficiency of 0.37%.

Differential involvement of α4β2, α7 and α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in B lymphocyte activation in vitro,

Abstract: Mouse B lymphocytes express several nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes, their exact functions being not clearly understood. Here we show that α7 nAChR was present in about 60%, while α4β2 and α9(α10) nAChRs in about 10% and 20% of mouse spleen B lymphocytes, respectively; Balb/c and C57Bl/6 mice possessed different relative amounts of these nAChR subtypes. α4β2 and α7, but not α9(α10) nAChRs, were up-regulated upon B lymphocyte activation in vitro. Flow cytometry and sandwich ELISA studies demonstrated that α7 and α9(α10) nAChRs are coupled to CD40, whereas α4β2 nAChR is coupled to IgM. B lymphocytes of both α7−/− and β2−/− mice responded to anti-CD40 stronger than those of the wild-type mice, whereas the cells of β2−/− mice responded to anti-IgM worse than those of the wild-type or α7−/− mice. Inhibition of α7 and α9(α10) nAChRs with methyllicaconitine resulted in considerable augmentation of CD40-mediated B lymphocyte proliferation in cells of all genotypes; stimulation of α4β2 nAChRs with epibatidine increased the IgM-mediated proliferation of the wild-type and α7−/−, but not β2−/− cells. Inhibition of α9(α10) nAChRs with α-conotoxin PeAI exerted weak stimulating effect on CD40-mediated proliferation. This nAChR subtype was up-regulated in α7−/− B-cells. α7 nAChRs were found recruited to immune synapses between human T and B lymphocytes, both of which produced acetylcholine. It is concluded that α7 nAChR fulfills inhibitory CD40-related mitogenic function, α4β2 nAChR produces a stimulatory IgM-related effect, while α9α10 nAChR is a “reserve” receptor, which partly compensates the absence of α7 nAChR in α7−/− cells. Acetylcholine is an additional mediator to modulate activation of interacting T and B lymphocytes.

Abstract: The effects of different annealing conditions such as atmospheres, temperatures and times on the structural, morphological and optical properties of ZnS thin films prepared on ITO coated glass substrates by chemical bath deposition were studied. Aqueous solutions of zinc acetate and thiourea were used as precursors along with stable complexing agents, such as Na2EDTA and Na3-citrate, in an alkaline medium. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the as-deposited and as-annealed ZnS films had an amorphous structure or poor crystallinity below the optimized annealing conditions of 500°C and 60min with the exception of the films annealed in N2+H2S annealing atmosphere. The ZnS thin films annealed in N2+H2S atmosphere for 1h at 500°C showed three sharp peaks for the (111), (220) and (113) planes of polycrystalline cubic ZnS without any unwanted secondary ZnO phases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed Zn–OH and Zn–S bonding in the as-deposited ZnS thin film. However, the ZnS thin films annealed at 500°C showed Zn–S bonding regardless of the annealing atmosphere. The sharp absorption edge and band gap energy of the as-deposited and as-annealed ZnS thin films varied from 295 to 310nm and 3.5 to 3.89eV, respectively.

Abstract: Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) power is a form of clean and renewable energy. However, the cost of harvesting solar energy is still economically prohibitive as compared to more traditional electricity generation methods such as hydroelectric or fossil fuel power. In this study, an innovative, high volume but low cost thermal slumping process was proposed as an alternative method for manufacturing of glass mirrors for high concentration photovoltaic system. In this paper, first a freeform optical design was performed to create a two-stage concentrator with ±1° acceptance angle and uniform output irradiance. Ray-tracing simulation was performed to evaluate the optical design. A machinable ceramic, MACOR®, was tested as mold material for its preferred mechanical and chemical stability at high temperature conditions. To assist the development of the slumping process, finite element method (FEM) simulation was performed to compensate for the mold design for manufacturing errors in this process. Moreover, surface profile and surface roughness were measured to characterize the thermal slumping process. Different manufacturing parameters were tested to identify the proper slumping conditions. It is discovered that surface roughness of the inner surface of the slumped glass mirror remained unchanged after slumping under a pre-determined soaking temperature. This study established a methodology for low cost, high volume glass optics for possible solar concentrator applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we report a novel approach for the fabrication of chalcopyrite CuInxGa1−xSe2 thin film solar cells by inkjet printing. The short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and total area power conversion efficiency (η) of the device are 29.78mA/cm2, 386mV, 0.44%, and 5.04%, respectively. Inkjet printing at atmospheric environment offers an opportunity for the direct patterning of absorber materials at large scale. This provides a potential cost advantage over conventional fabrication process that involves sequential deposition, patterning, and etching of selected materials. In addition, inkjet printing increases the raw material utilization ratio compared to more wasteful vacuum-based deposition techniques.

Abstract: Crystalline compounds (C14H29NH3)2CuCl4(s) and (C15H31NH3)2CuCl4(s) were synthesized. X-ray crystallography was applied to characterize crystal structures of the two compounds. The crystal system is both monoclinic, the space group is both C2/c, and Z=4. The lattice potential energies of the title compounds were calculated to be UPOT [(C14H29NH3)2CuCl4,s]=853.12kJ/mol and UPOT [(C15H31NH3)2CuCl4, s]=854.93kJ/mol. Low-temperature heat capacities of the two compounds were measured by a precision automatic adiabatic calorimeter over the temperature range from 78 to 395K. The temperatures, molar enthalpies, and entropies of two phase transitions for each of the two complexes were determined to be: for (C14H29NH3)2CuCl4(s), 342.35±0.11K, 76.17±0.40kJ/mol, and 222.49±1.20J/Kmol for the first peak; 352.61±0.09K, 27.83±0.27kJ/mol, and 78.92±0.78J/Kmol for the second peak, and for (C15H31NH3)2CuCl4(s), they were 345.40±0.93K, 62.06±1.07kJ/mol, and 179.67±2.63J/Kmol for the first peak; 360.98±0.25K, 21.66±0.76kJ/mol, and 60.00±2.09J/Kmol for the second peak, respectively. The smoothed heat capacities and thermodynamic functions (HTο−H298.15ο) and (ΔtrsSm=ΔtrsHm/Ttrs) of the two compounds were calculated with an interval of 5K based on the experimental heat capacities.

Abstract: Radical pairs, polarons and fullerene anion radicals photoinduced by photons with energy of 1.98–2.73eV in bulk heterojunctions formed by poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with bis(1-[3-(methoxycarbonyl)propyl]-1-phenyl)-[6.6]C62 (bis-PCBM) methanofullerene have been studied as compared with P3HT/PCBM composite by direct light-induced EPR (LEPR) method in a wide temperature range. A part of spin polarons and methanofullerene anion radicals are pinned in trap sites which number and depth are governed by an ordering of the polymer/fullerene system and energy of initiating photons. It has been shown that dynamics and recombination of mobile polarons and counter methanofullerene anion radicals are governed by their exchange- and multi-trap assisted diffusion. Relaxation and dynamics of both the charge carriers determined by the steady-state saturation method are governed by structure and conformation of their microenvironment as well as by the photon energy. Longitudinal diffusion of polarons was shown to depend on lattice phonons of crystalline domains embedded into an amorphous polymer matrix. The energy barrier required for polaron interchain hopping is higher than its intrachain diffusion. Pseudorotation of fullerene derivatives in a polymer matrix was shown to follow the activation Pike model. The replacement of PCBM by bis-PCBM provides higher anisotropy of polaron dynamics and decreases its selectivity to the photon energy. This makes spin dynamics easier and minimizes energy dispersion at charge transfer.

Abstract: Simple analytical and statistical models for the evaluation of the temperature of PV-modules from climatic data (ambient temperature, global solar irradiation, and wind speed) are investigated. The parameters which describe the effects of cell technology and module design were evaluated from outdoor exposure data at different climatic regions. The models were validated by comparison of the simulated module temperatures with measured module temperatures at different test sites. A simplified way to determine a Realistic Nominal Module Temperature (ROMT) instead of the Nominal Operating Cell Temperature (NOCT) is proposed.

Abstract: The integrin α2β1 plays an important role in force-transmitting cell–matrix interactions. It recognizes the peptide sequence GFOGER (O=4-hydroxy-proline) presented as trimer within a collagenous triple-helical framework. We produced the recombinant non-hydroxylated mini-collagen, termed FC3, which harbors the α2β1 integrin recognition site. FC3 consists of a foldon-stabilized host triple helix of three chains with 10 GPP-repeats, into which the integrin binding motif was inserted. The triple-helical structure could further be stabilized by covalently cross-linking the three chains. Unlike collagen-I, FC3 lacks binding sites for matrix proteins and cellular receptors other than the collagen-binding integrins. It showed a preference for α2β1 over α1β1 integrin, especially when the chains were neither cross-linked nor prolyl-hydroxylated. Using FC3 as substratum for primary skin fibroblasts, we showed that the loss of α2β1 integrin could not be compensated by other collagen-binding integrins, suggesting a major role of α2β1 integrin in exerting sufficient mechanical force to induce or sustain cell spreading. Atomic force microscopy revealed that a single α2β1 integrin can withstand tensile forces of up to approximately 160pN before it releases FC3. Moreover, FC3 is fully competent to agonistically elicit α2β1 integrin-induced cell reactions, such as recruitment of α2β1 integrin into focal adhesions and lamellipodia formation. The biofunctionalized mini-collagen sheds light on the molecular forces of the α2β1 integrin–collagen interaction, which affects tissue homeostasis by contracting the connective tissue and by contributing to interstitial tissue pressure regulation. Additionally, biofunctionalized mini-collagens can be useful in force-resistant cell attachment to biomedical materials.

Abstract: Polycrystalline Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films have been directly deposited on heating Mo-coated glass substrates by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) method. The results of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) indicate that these CZTS thin films are Cu-rich and S-poor. The combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) results and Raman spectroscopy reveals that these thin films exhibit strong preferential orientation of grains along [112] direction and small Cu2−xS phase easily exists in CZTS thin films. The lattice parameters and grain sizes have been examined based on XRD patterns and Atom Force Microscopy (AFM). The band gap (Eg) of CZTS thin films, which are determined by reflection spectroscopy varies from 1.53 to 1.98eV, depending on substrate temperature (Tsub). The optical absorption coefficient of CZTS thin film (Tsub=450°C) measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) is above 104cm−1.

Abstract: Transparent Al-doped ZnO thin films were deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering with different oxygen flow rates. The electronic resistivity, measured by the 4 point-probe method, is very sensitive to the sample position relative to the magnetron axis: the closer the magnetron from the axis the higher the resistivity. This is more pronounced for the films deposited under higher oxygen flow rate. Neither Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy nor Zn–K edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses evidenced any change in chemical composition such as a measurable variation of the oxygen stoichiometry. XANES at the Al–K and O–K edges show that (i) a portion of the aluminum atoms get positioned in octahedral conformation with oxygen, consistent with the formation of an Al2O3(ZnO)m nanolaminate structure, (ii) the films exhibit relaxed O-terminated (0001) surfaces with a higher density of empty states in more resistive samples. These two findings are believed to play a significant role on the electrical measurements by dopant deactivation and by creating an insulating barrier at the film surface, respectively.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films prepared by a non-vacuum process based on the sulfurization of precursor coatings, consisting of a sol–gel solution of Cu, Zn, and Sn, under H2S+N2 atmosphere were investigated. The structure, microstructure, and electronic properties of the CZTS thin films as well as solar cell parameters were studied in dependence on the H2S concentration. The sulfurization process was carried out at 500°C for 1h in an H2S+N2 mixed-gas atmosphere with H2S concentrations of 3%, 5%, 10%, and 20%. As the H2S concentration decreased from 20% to 5%, the S content of the CZTS thin films decreased. However, when the H2S concentration was decreased below 3%, the S content of the films began to increase. A CZTS thin film prepared with an H2S concentration of 3% had grains in the order of 1μm in size, which were larger than those of films prepared at other H2S concentrations. Furthermore, the most efficient solar cell, with a conversion efficiency of 2.23%, was obtained from a sample sulfurized at an H2S concentration of 3%.

Abstract: The fabrication and full characterization of luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) comprising CdSe core/multishell quantum dots (QDs) is reported. TEM analysis shows that the QDs are well dispersed in the acrylic medium while maintaining a high quantum yield of 45%, resulting in highly transparent and luminescent polymer plates. A detailed optical analysis of the QD-LSCs including absorption, emission, and time-resolved fluorescence measurements is presented. Both silicon and GaAs solar cells attached to the side of the QD-LSCs are used to measure the external quantum efficiency and power conversion efficiency (2.8%) of the devices. Stability tests show only a minor decrease of 4% in photocurrent upon an equivalent of three months outdoor illumination. The optical data are used as input for a ray-trace model that is shown to describe the properties of the QD-LSCs well. The model was then used to extrapolate the properties of the small test devices to predict the power conversion efficiency of a 50×50cm2 module with a variety of different solar cells. The work described here gives a detailed insight into the promise of QD-based LSCs.

Abstract: Diphtheria toxin has been well characterized in terms of its receptor binding and receptor mediated endocytosis. However, the precise mechanism of the cytosolic release of diphtheria toxin fragment A from early endosomes is still unclear. Various reports differ regarding the requirement for cytosolic factors in this process. Here, we present data indicating that the distribution of actin filaments due to cytochalasin D action enhances the retention of diphtheria toxin in early endosomes. Treating cells with cytochalasin D reduces the cytosolic fragment A activity and leads to changes in the intracellular distribution and size of early endosomes with toxin cargo. F-actin and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 can promote fragment A release from toxin-loaded early endosomes in an in vitro translocation system. Moreover, these proteins bind to toxin-loaded early endosomes in vitro and promote each other's binding. They are thus thought to be involved in the cytosolic release of fragment A. Finally, ADP-ribosylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 is shown to inhibit fragment A release and, via a feed-back mechanism, to account for the minute amounts of fragment A normally found in the cytosol.

Abstract: Rosai-Dorfman disease, also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a benign indolent disorder, characterized by enlarged lymph nodes filled with histiocytes. Extranodal involvement is uncommon. The disease rarely affects the nose and paranasal sinuses. We report a case that presented with a right nasal mass, extending into all the paranasal sinuses and right orbit without any accompanying lymphadenopathy. Because of the absence of lymphadenopathy it posed a diagnostic challenge until the pathology was confirmed on histopathological examination.

Abstract: Device-grade ternary Cu–Ga–Se chalcopyrite thin films used for photovoltaic energy conversion have been prepared by a novel chemical close-spaced vapor transport (CCSVT) technique developed for a deposition on areas of up to 10×10cm2. A two-step process has been developed which allows the fine tuning of the film composition and the electronic properties. The extension of deposition times in the two-step process led to final film compositions with [Ga]/[Cu] ratios ranging from 0.9 to 5.7, allowing the study of the structural phase transitions. In this paper the main focus of interest is related to the material properties of the device-grade thin films prepared by CCSVT technique. We present our recent studies on (i) the growth, compositional, structural and electronic structural properties, (ii) the degradation under ambient conditions and (iii) the feasibility of n-type doping this p-type semiconducting material by germanium. Thin films were grown with chalcopyrite (1:1:2) and CuGaSe2-related defect compound structures (DC) with stoichiometries of CuGa3Se5 and CuGa5Se8. In order to derive the DC structure, X-ray and neutron powder diffraction investigations have been carried out on powders of these CuGaSe2-related compounds grown by elemental synthesis (powder) and CCSVT (thin films), respectively. We found no hints for an ordering of defects, as proposed in the past and giving name to the so-called Ordered Defect Compounds (ODC) in this and related structures. From our results a growth model is presented for CuGa3Se5 formation in gallium-rich CCSVT-grown CuGaxSey films. The chemical and electronic surface and interface structure of CuGaSe2 thin films with bulk [Ga]/[Cu] ratios between 0.94 and 1.39 is investigated by X-ray and UV-excited photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS, respectively). A transition of the Cu:Ga:Se surface composition from 1:1:2 for the Cu-rich bulk sample to 1:3:5 for the sample with the highest bulk [Ga]/[Cu] ratio is observed. Simultaneously, a downward shift of the valence band maximum position with respect to the Fermi energy is found. The comparison of the estimated conduction band minimum with that of CdS reveals the formation of a pronounced “cliff-like” conduction band offset at the respective interface. Furthermore, the CuGaSe2 thin film degradation under ambient as well as under thermal conditions of CuGaSe2 thin films has been studied by XPS. During thermal oxidation, the formation of predominantly Ga2O3 and some amount of SeO2 were observed, but no copper oxides could be detected in the near-surface region of the thin films. The same oxides are found after native oxidation in air under ambient conditions. An additional sodium oxide compound formed at the thin film surface, NaxO and Na2CO3 after thermal and native oxidation, respectively. Germanium ion implantation technique of the near-surface region of CuGaSe2 thin films has been used in order to prove the feasibility of n-type doping. In photoluminescence (PL) studies, the occurrence of a new emission line is identified as Ge related and explained as a donor–acceptor-pair (DAP) recombination. The precise role the Ge is playing in this doping of CuGaSe2 is revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) and ab initio calculations based on the density functional theory. The studies indicate that the incorporated Ge atoms preferentially occupy Ga sites when relaxation around the dopant is taken into account. Additionally, our corresponding theoretical band structure model predicts the existence of additional localized electronic acceptor and donor defect bands within the band gap of CuGaSe2 originating from a strong covalent interaction between Ge 4s and Se 4p states for Ge atoms tetrahedrally surrounded by the Se nearest-neighbor atoms. A theoretically predicted anti-bonding Ge–Se4sp3 defect band appearing well above the Fermi level for the Ge1+Ga point defect system can be directly linked to a Ge-dopant-related donor–acceptor-pair transition as observed in our photoluminescence spectra.

Abstract: The inverted organic photovoltaic (OPV) device architecture represents an important advancement due to the relative environmental stability of the electron transport layer (ETL) and hole-collecting contact. We investigated the initial and long-term behavior of inverted devices to identify changes taking place at the Ag hole-collecting contact. We show that efficient hole collection can be obtained after modifying the Ag contact by thermal annealing, long-term exposure to ambient atmosphere, or employing a high work function organic hole-transport layer (HTL). We find that whether or not the device employs an organic HTL, degradation of the photocurrent initially follows a simple exponential decay. After prolonged illumination (>500h), devices with an organic HTL fail catastrophically due to a precipitous drop in photocurrent. Based on evidence for pinhole-induced degradation observed in photocurrent maps, we propose a nucleation and island growth mechanism and a model for the photocurrent behavior employing a modified Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation. Devices that do not contain an HTL appear to degrade by a mechanism other than pinhole ingress resulting in a more uniform degradation of the photocurrent across the active area.

Abstract: This paper presents the fabrication of thin film crystalline silicon solar cells on foreign substrates like alumina, glass–ceramic (GC) and metallic foils (ferritic steel—FS) using seed layer approach, which employs aluminium induced crystallisation (AIC) of amorphous silicon. Effect of hydrogen content in a-Si:H precursor films on the AIC process has been studied and the results showed that defects in the AIC grown films increased with increase of hydrogen content. At the optimal thermal annealing conditions, the AIC grown poly-Si films showed an average grain size of 7.6, 26, and 8.1μm for the films synthesised on alumina, GC, and FS, respectively. The grains were (100) oriented with a sharp Raman peak around 520cm−1. Similarly, n-type seed layers were also fabricated by over-doping of as-grown AIC layers using a highly phosphorus doped glass solution. The resistivity of as-grown films reduced from 8.4×10−2Ωcm (p-type) to 4.1×10−4Ωcm (n-type) after phosphorus diffusion. These seed layers of n-type/p-type were thickened to form an absorber layer by vapour phase epitaxy or solid phase epitaxy. The passivation step was applied before the heterojunction formation, while it was after in the case of homojunction. Open circuit voltage of the junctions showed a strong dependence on the hydrogenation temperature and microwave (μW) power of electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma of hydrogen. Effective passivation was achieved at a μW power of 650W and hydrogenation temperature of 400°C. Higher values of solar conversion efficiencies of 5% and 2.9% were achieved for the n-type and p-type heterojunction cells, respectively fabricated on alumina substrates. The analysis of the results and limiting factors are discussed in detail.

Abstract: Laser patterning of thin film solar cells has proven technically feasible for all layers but still remains a challenging topic for research and development. We present a method where P2 laser patterning of CIGS thin film solar modules is performed after deposition of the ZnO:Al layer, as opposed to the current state-of-the-art where patterning is performed before the ZnO:Al layer is deposited. This method takes full advantage of the potential of laser processing and works by creating an interconnecting scribe line that “welds” the ZnO:Al and CIGS layers into an electrical contact. In this work we present experimental results of this process on five different sets of CIGS with slightly varying thickness and Cu content. While optimization of the process with respect to the various layers has not been performed, the initial results for CIGS thin film modules show working experimental modules in each set. The best experimental module has a fill factor of 71% and its performance is within the standard deviation of mechanically patterned references. An experimental submodule of 30×30cm2 size with 10% efficiency was manufactured.

Abstract: The light trapping characteristics in the wavelength range of 0.5−1.2μm for the random back-reflective silicon film with omnidirectional top anti-reflection are numerically analyzed based on the simplified probability method. The spectrum averaged maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) for the 5μm thick silicon film is evaluated with an increase of 10.6% compared with the best bulk planar silicon solar cell—suggesting that an efficiency higher than those of the best bulk planar cell can be obtained for thin film silicon solar cells several microns thick. The light absorption curves drop slowly with increased back absorption, exhibiting that the performance of the thin film silicon solar cell with light trapping is tolerant of back absorption.

Abstract: Self-assembling due to the presence of electric field during deposition in the spray deposited nanocrystalline CdX and HgX (X=Se and Te) thin films is reported. The films are deposited using solvothermally synthesized nanoparticles dispersed in 1-butanol and sprayed on the glass substrates at 200°C without any voltage as well as by applying a voltage to the nozzle. The electron microscopy studies reveal the formation of nanorods for the films deposited with the voltage. The X-ray diffractograms of CdSe films deposited without voltage and with voltage show hexagonal crystal structure. On the other hand, CdTe films deposited without voltage show cubic crystal structure and the films deposited with voltage show hexagonal crystal structure. HgX films deposited without and with voltage show cubic crystal structure and there is no nanorod formation below 700V. HRTEM studies show the growth direction of the CdX nanostructures. In view of the self-assembly observed under voltage, the induced dipole moment and the resultant electrostatic interaction are expected to be the driving force for the growth of nanorods. Blueshift in the band gap is observed for all the films deposited without and with voltages, and it is attributed to the quantum confinement effect due to the formation self-assembled one-dimensional nanostructures.

Abstract: Morphological and electrical defects in polycrystalline silicon solar cells are distinguished by scanning electron acoustic microscopy (SEAM) and electron beam induced current (EBIC) techniques, respectively. It was found that while some defects are both morphologically and electrically detectable, some are predominantly only either electrical or morphological in nature. Combining both SEAM and EBIC is therefore an ideal approach as the two techniques can provide complementary information on both the morphological and electrical manifestation of the defects.

Abstract: Micron-sized aluminum (Al) particles are widely used in the fabrication of rear electrodes of Si solar cells. Moreover, the rear electrode of Si solar cells can be fabricated at relatively low electrode firing temperature using submicron Al particles whose sizes can be easily controlled, but there have not been any clear methods to obtain submicron Al particles yet. In this study, we first successfully prepared size-controlled Al submicron particles via a wet chemical process using dibutyl ether solvent and then to fabricate rear electrodes of Si solar cells; to our knowledge, this is the first such application of submicron Al particles. The geometric mean diameter (Dp) of the Al particles could be controlled from 139 to 614nm by adjusting the reaction temperature, and the prepared Al particles showed geometric standard deviations (σg) of 1.25–1.30. The Al particle size was reduced to ∼35nm by adding an organic surfactant to the precursor solution for Al particle preparation. Rear electrodes were fabricated by firing the screen printed Al paste films comprising Al particles with geometric mean diameters of ∼379nm from 600 to 900°C. The electrode fired at 750°C showed the minimum electrical sheet resistivity of 77.9mΩ/□ (specific resistivity: 97.3μΩcm) and contained a BSF (back surface field) with a thickness of ∼3μm. Our results indicate that the reported method can be used to minimize the thermal defects in the rear electrode of Si solar cells by lowering the electrode firing temperature.

Abstract: Mast cells play a critical role in the development of the allergic response. Upon activation by allergens and IgE via the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcɛRI), these cells release histamine and other functional mediators that initiate and propagate immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Mast cells also secrete cytokines that can regulate immune activity. These processes are controlled, in whole or part, by increases in intracellular Ca2+ induced by the FcɛRI. We show here that N-(4-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)phenyl)-4-methyl-1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-carboxamide (BTP2), a pyrazole derivative, inhibits activation-induced Ca2+ influx in the rat basophil cell line RBL-2H3 and in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs), without affecting global tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins or phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1/2, JNK and p38. BTP2 also inhibits activation-induced degranulation and secretion of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by BMMCs, which correlates with the inhibition of Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) translocation. In vivo, BTP2 inhibits antigen-induced histamine release. Structure–activity relationship analysis indicates that substitution at the C3 or C5 position of the pyrazole moiety on BTP2 (5-trifluoromethyl-3-methyl-pyrazole or 3-trifluoromethyl-5-methyl-pyrazole, respectively) affected its activity, with the trifluoromethyl group at the C3 position being critical to its activity. We conclude that BTP2 and related compounds may be potent modulators of mast cell responses and potentially useful for the treatment of symptoms of allergic inflammation.

Abstract: A novel low-emissive (low-E) coating based on plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited hydrogenated diamond-like amorphous carbon (DLC) films has been developed. The coating is a three-layer structure comprised of a nano-thin Ag layer sandwiched between DLC layers. The tunable optical properties that the DLC layers afford make it extremely appealing for large-scale, low-cost manufacturing of low-E coatings. We have shown that the refractive index of DLC films can be precisely tuned between 1.55 and 2.15 at a wavelength of 550nm, while the optical gap can be tuned between 1.7 and 4.0eV. The tunable optical properties allow greater flexibility and provide an additional parameter for optimization of low-E coatings. The tunability also allows for simple fabrication of multi-layer or graded-layer low-E coatings. Initial results of the DLC based low-E coating have a mid-IR reflectance of approximately 95% and a transmittance of approximately 70% over the visible frequencies.

Abstract: The electronic energy transfer properties between Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions have been studied in a fluoroindate glass for solar cell applications. The Ho3+ ions absorb infrared radiation at around 1150nm, below the energy gap of Si solar cells. Energy transfer between Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions produces an upconversion emission in the visible and in the near infrared spectral range just above the Si bandgap. When these glasses are placed at the rear of a bifacial Si solar cell, the upconverted radiation can be absorbed by Si and generate electron–hole pairs that contribute to enhance the cell efficiency. An estimation of the expected increase in photo-current has been calculated when the upconverter material is used in a solar concentrator. Besides, they can be used alone or together with other Er3+ doped phosphors for the same purpose. The Ho3+–Yb3+ upconversion emission characteristics have been investigated as a function of the doping ion concentrations. Excitation, pump power dependency and dynamic experiments have been performed to determine the electronic energy transfer mechanism that is responsible of the upconversion. A rate equation analysis shows a reasonable agreement between the model and the experimental data.

Abstract: Production of solar cells has increased rapidly in recent years, and metallurgical production of solar grade silicon (SoG-Si), has increased compared with more expensive processes such as Siemens process and Cz processes. It is important to understand the thermodynamic behavior of phosphorus in slag for optimized refinement of SoG-Si. In this study, the thermodynamic behavior of phosphorus in the CaO–SiO2–CaF2 slag system was investigated at 1773K for various oxygen potential and slag composition. In addition, evaporation of phosphorus in the reduction process was observed during slag refining by addition of H2 gas. Experimental results showed that the stability of phosphorus in slag depends on both the O2−(basicity) content of the slag and the solubility of Ca in silicon, and the dissolution mechanism of phosphorus into slag was derived. Results confirmed that phosphorus and calcium in molten silicon were also removed by acid leaching. The effective removal of phosphorus for SoG-Si using several refining processes was evaluated quantitatively.

Abstract: A dual-type electrochromic device was assembled using optically transparent electrodes modified with thin films of poly[(R)-(-)-3-(1-pyrrolyl)propyl-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)-α-phenylglycinate], poly(DNBP) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene), PEDOT and a polymer electrolyte. After assembling, the device was characterized by spectroelectrochemical techniques. The best performance of this device could be obtained by adjusting the relative thickness of the active polymer films and the potential range of operation of the device. The device shows color variation during ca. 350 charge/discharge cycles and can be constructed under atmospheric conditions.

Dose-dependent mutual regulation between Wip1 and p53 following UVC irradiation,

Abstract: DNA damage stabilizes and activates p53, which selectively induces downstream targets to modulate the cellular response. As a homeostatic regulator of cell cycle checkpoint, the p53 target Wip1 plays essential roles in releasing cells from DNA damage-induced checkpoints after appropriate repair of the damaged-DNA. It is unknown how Wip1 performs when the DNA damage is beyond repair. Here we address that Wip1 displays dose-dependent responses to UVC irradiation. A low dose of UVC, which stimulates intra-S phase cell cycle arrest, transiently induces the Wip1 protein levels in a p53-dependent manner. In contrast, a high dose of UVC, which induces apoptosis, suppresses the Wip1 protein levels in a p53-independent manner. The UVC dose-dependent response of Wip1 correlates not only with the cellular response but also with the activity of p53. Wip1 dephosphorylates p53 on its Ser15 residue. However, the mutual regulation between Wip1 and p53 is only triggered by a low dose of UVC. In response to a high dose of UVC, the sustained activation of p53 fails to induce the downstream targets, including Wip1, Mdm2, p21 and GADD45α. Nonetheless, the reduced Wip1 level contributes to the sustained accumulation of phospho-p53 (Ser15) in response to a high dose of UVC. Our results suggest that Wip1 is regulated by UVC in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the mutual regulation between Wip1 and p53 is highly dose-dependent upon UVC irradiation, and this contributes to the different outcomes of the cellular response to UVC.

Abstract: A series of new “D-A-D” chromophores containing hexafluorocyclopentene thiophene as an acceptor and a triphenylamine unit as a donor, called TP-G1, TP-G2, TPB-G1 and TPB-G2, were designed and synthesized. Heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells containing these chromophores were fabricated, and device 1, with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TP-G1:P3HT/LiF/Al, displayed an open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and power-conversion efficiency (η) of 0.74 V, 1.178mA/cm2 and 0.22%, respectively. The triphenylamine group could effectively induce the open-ring isomer to close because the 4- and 4′- positions of the benzene rings were substituted by an electron-donating group and the value of the quantum yields of the closed-ring isomers increased. As a result, the closed-ring isomer facilitated intramolecular π-electron delocalization and exhibited a broad absorption band ranging from 200 to 850nm. Due to the fluorine substitution of hexafluorocylopentene at the molecular center and the hole-transport characteristics of the triphenylamine moiety on the periphery, our chromophores showed obvious dual semiconductor properties, i.e., n- and p-type, which demonstrated a potential application for OPV devices.

Abstract: We synthesise 7nm CuInSe2 nanocrystals of low size and shape dispersion using copper(I) chloride, indium(III) chloride and selenourea as the precursors. The obtained nanocrystals are deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) covered glass by means of layer-by-layer dip-coating. After each deposition step, a ligand exchange process with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) is carried out. The new ligands interconnect the nanocrystals, which therefore become insoluble during subsequent dip-coating steps. Furthermore, the small EDT molecules replace the long insulating alkyl chains of the oleylamine stabilizing ligands used during the synthesis. I/V measurements of a 1μm thick film sandwiched between the ITO substrate and an aluminium electrode show a current density of 1μA/cm2 at 1V in the dark, which increases to 16μA/cm2 under illumination with white light.

Abstract: The limiting factors on the efficiency of current record devices are discussed. Optical and collection losses are found to have a minor influence. They reduce the short circuit current. Higher losses are due to recombination losses. The defects responsible for Shockley–Read–Hall recombination are discussed, and it is concluded that Shockley–Read–Hall recombination is not likely the source for the open circuit voltage loss. However the recombination is increased by inhomogeneities. Inhomogeneities of the band gap can be excluded, because they are too small to have significant influence. Electrostatic potential variations at charged extended defects like grain boundaries are however responsible for losses in the open circuit voltage.

Abstract: The thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TALH) is normally exposed to variable and often very high osmotic stress and involves different mechanisms to counteract this stress. ER resident calcium binding proteins especially calreticulin (CALR) play an important role in different stress balance mechanisms. To investigate the role of CALR in renal epithelial cells adaptation and survival under osmotic stress, two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry and functional proteomics were performed. CALR expression was significantly altered in TALH cells exposed to osmotic stress, whereas renal inner medullary collecting duct cells and interstitial cells exposed to hyperosmotic stress showed no significant changes in CALR expression. Moreover, a time dependent downregulation of CALR was accompanied with continuous change in the level of free intracellular calcium. Inhibition of the calcium release, through IP3R antagonist, prevented CALR expression alteration under hyperosmotic stress, whereas the cell viability was significantly impaired. Overexpression of wild type CALR in TALH cells resulted in significant decrease in cell viability under hyperosmotic stress. In contrast, the hyperosmotic stress did not have any effect on cells overexpressing the CALR mutant, lacking the calcium-binding domain. Silencing CALR with siRNA significantly improved the cell survival under osmotic stress conditions. Taken together, our data clearly highlight the crucial role of CALR and its calcium-binding role in TALH adaptation and survival under osmotic stress.

Abstract: Thermal silicon oxides are known to very effectively passivate silicon surfaces. Choosing a water vapor ambient instead of a dry oxygen atmosphere increases the oxidation rate by about one order of magnitude and considerably reduces process time and costs. State of the art pyrox systems produce steam by pyrolysis of hydrogen and oxygen gas. A new approach is the purification of vaporized deionized (DI) water. In this work we present a direct comparison of both steam generation systems, which are connected to the same quartz tube of an industrial high quality tube furnace. The higher steam saturation of the direct steam process enhances the growth rate by about 20% compared to a pyrolytic steam based process. On low-resistivity p-type substrates, excellent surface recombination velocities of around 25cm/s are found for both systems after a forming gas anneal. Detailed characterization shows similar physical properties of the oxide layers grown by either steam from pyrolysis or purified steam. Moreover, thermal oxide rear surface passivated silicon solar cells show similar high efficiencies exceeding 18.0% irrespective of the applied steam generation technology.

Abstract: Ag–Al2O3 nanocermet spectrally selective solar absorber coatings were prepared at different Ag contents on copper, silicon and glass substrates using unbalanced magnetron sputtering technique. Asymmetric bipolar pulsed direct current power supply and radio frequency power supply were used to sputter Ag and Al2O3 targets, respectively. The optimized coating exhibited high absorptance (α=0.93) in the visible region and low emittance (ε=0.04–0.05 at 82°C) in the infrared region of the solar spectrum. Presence of the strong absorption band in the absorber coating is due to the surface plasmon resonance, i.e., collective oscillation of the conduction band electrons under the influence of the optical excitation. Atomic force microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction, micro-Raman spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry and spectrophotometer were used to characterize the nanostructure, composition and optical properties of these coatings. The face centered cubic crystalline structure of Ag nanoparticles inclusion in the amorphous alumina dielectric matrix was confirmed using X-ray diffraction. The size distribution and concentration of Ag nanoparticles embedded in Al2O3 dielectric matrix was studied using FESEM image analysis. The variations of refractive index and extinction coefficient with wavelength were obtained using phase modulation spectroscopic ellipsometry. The variation of absorption with wavelength in the UV–vis region was characterized using spectrophotometer. In order to study the thermal stability of the absorber coatings, they were annealed in vacuum at different temperatures (i.e., 200–400°C) for 2h. For the vacuum annealed coatings (heated up to 400°C), chemical/micro-structural changes were studied using micro-Raman spectroscopy and FESEM. No shift in the Raman peaks for the Al2O3 was observed, confirming its structural stability in the absorber coatings with annealing in vacuum up to 400°C. However, FESEM image analysis confirmed that the degradation in the vacuum annealed coatings was due to defragmentation of the Ag nanoparticles.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in cell growth, differentiation, and death. Excessive amounts of ROS (e.g., O2−, H2O2, and HO) play a role in aging as well as in many human diseases. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are critical antioxidant enzymes in living organisms. SOD catalyzes the dismutation of O2− to H2O2, and GPx catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 and other harmful peroxides by glutathione (GSH). They not only function in catalytic processes but also protect each other, resulting in more efficient removal of ROS, protection of cells against injury, and maintenance of the normal metabolism of ROS. To imitate the synergism of SOD and GPx, a 65-mer peptide (65P), containing sequences that form the domains of the active center of SOD and the catalytic triad of GPx upon the incorporation of some metals, was designed on the basis of native enzyme structural models; 65P was expressed in the cysteine auxotrophic expression system to obtain Se-65P. Se-65P was converted into Se–CuZn-65P by incorporating Cu2+ and Zn2+. Se–CuZn-65P exhibited high SOD and GPx activities because it has a delicate dual-activity center. The synergism of the enzyme mimic was evaluated by using an in vitro model and a xanthine/xanthine oxidase/Fe2+-induced mitochondrial damage model system. We anticipate that the peptide enzyme mimic with synergism is promising for the treatment of human diseases and has potential applications in medicine as a potent antioxidant.

Abstract: A new type of solar cell with structure glass/ITO/CdS/PbS/conductive graphite was constructed and studied. Both window (CdS) and absorption (PbS) layers were deposited by means of the chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique. The maximum temperature employed during the solar cell processing was 70°C and it did not include any post-treatment. In case of the CdS window layer, complexing agents alternative to ammonia were employed in the CBD process and their effects on the CdS films properties were studied. The solar cells are photosensitive in a large spectral range (all visible and near infrared regions); the cell with the area of 0.16cm2 without any special treatment has shown the values of open-circuit voltage Voc of 290mV and short circuit current Jsc of 14mA/cm2 with the efficiency η=1.63% (fill factor FF is 0.36) under illumination intensity of 900W/m2. It was found that the CBD-made PbS layer has a certain degree of porosity, which favorably affects its applicability in solar cell construction. The possible ways of device optimization, and in particular, the effect of the PbS grain size on its performance are discussed.
