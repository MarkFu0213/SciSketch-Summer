Abstract: Much attention has been recently focused on realizing, by chemical treatment, an artificial superhydrophobic surface with elevated roughness in order to achieve both self cleaning and antireflective effects because superhydrophobic surface with surface functionalization is believed to be effective for the self cleaning effect, mimicking a lotus leaf. Various hydrophobic, hydrophilic, superhydrophobic, and superhydrophilic glasses are evaluated by monitoring the variation of water contact angle (CA), optical transmittance, and photovoltaic performance under outdoor conditions for 12 weeks. Our results show a nanopatterned superhydrophilic glass without surface chemical treatment exhibits more efficient self cleaning and antireflective effects, leading to only 1.39% of drop of solar cell efficiency during an outdoor test for 12 weeks, while the solar cells with bare glass packaging and fluorinated superhydrophobic packaging show 7.79% and 2.62% of efficiency drop, respectively.

Abstract: Surface and charge ratios between the two electrodes of an electrochromic cell have been shown to be variables that affect their optical and electrochemical performance. By changing the charge ratio, at fixed applied potentials, one of the electrodes decreases its oxidation state variation, therefore lowering its electrochromic response. If the ratio is increased to high enough values the electrode will act as an ion storage layer. Surface ratio also varies the charge ratio, but offers the possibility to use increasingly transparent ion storage layers, which in turn translate into better contrast of the corresponding device. The results obtained suggest a new configuration for electrochromic devices, in which optoelectrochemical performance can be optimized without the use of complementary materials.

Abstract: Large area polymer tandem solar cells completely processed using roll-to-roll (R2R) coating and printing techniques are demonstrated. A stable tandem structure was achieved by the use of orthogonal ink solvents for the coating of all layers, including both active layers. Processing solvents included water, alcohols and chlorobenzene. Open-circuit voltages close to the expected sum of sub cell voltages were achieved, while the overall efficiency of the tandem cells was found to be limited by the low yielding back cell, which was processed from water based ink. Many of the challenges associated with upscaling the multilayer tandem cells were identified giving valuable information for future experiments and development.

Abstract: We report on the application of ZnO:Al as the transparent conductive oxide in high performance inverted polymer solar cells. We show that the optimized inverted architecture, which does not contain low work function metals or water-based transport layers, can be employed without sacrificing device efficiency. The widely studied P3HT:PCBM donor–acceptor system was chosen for the active layer. ZnO:Al layers were produced by dc-magnetron sputtering on glass substrates and used as the cathode. The thickness of ZnO:Al was optimized to achieve a low sheet resistance while maintaining high transmission. The resulting ZnO:Al layers were smoother than the reference ITO samples, and the active layers could be processed directly onto ZnO:Al without employing additional buffer layers. The structure of the top anodic contact was also optimized. Initial devices with an Au layer demonstrated poor results, and device performance improved when a MoO3/Ag anode was used. Control devices in the standard forward structure using commercial ITO coated glass substrates were compared to the ZnO:Al based cells. Higher photocurrents were obtained in the inverted structures than in the ITO-based solar cells due to the higher transmittance of ZnO:Al in the spectral range where the blend absorbs.

Abstract: In this study, the overall barrier performance of multilayer thin-films and the shelf lifetime of encapsulated organic solar cells were correlated through the total amount of water vapor that permeated into the solar cell. Effective water vapor transmission rates were measured in both the transient and steady-state transport regimes for multilayer barrier films consisting of SiNx and parylene. The efficiency of pentacene/C60-based solar cells encapsulated with one or two pairs of SiNx/parylene dropped to 50% after permeation of about 1.63g/m2 of water vapor regardless of effective transmission rate of the barrier. From these calculations, cells encapsulated with three dyads were predicted to maintain performance for at least 13,500h while experiments up to 7500h showed less than 10% degradation in performance.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate in great detail the silicon nanowire (SiNW)/poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hybrid solar cells (SCs). Because of the light-trapping effect, SiNW/PEDOT:PSS SCs absorb more light than planar Si/PEDOT:PSS SCs. Also, the light absorption increases with the length of the SiNWs. However, the SiNW's length is not the only factor that influences the SCs. Thus the SiNW/PEDOT:PSS SCs with the shortest wire length of 0.37μm have the best performance in terms of the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.40%, the largest short circuit current density of 24.24mAcm−2, and open circuit voltage of 0.532V, compared with the SCs of other wire lengths. The reasons are two-fold. First, long SiNWs tend to aggregate at the top portion, making the infiltration of PEDOT:PSS difficult, so the coverage of PEDOT:PSS on the SiNWs is not complete. Second, the increase of SiNW length greatly reduces the minority-carrier lifetime. Our investigation will help develop SiNW SCs with improved performance.

Differential regulation of PML–RARα stability by the ubiquitin ligases SIAH1/SIAH2 and TRIAD1,

Abstract: The ubiquitin proteasome system plays an important role in normal and malignant hematopoiesis and relies on the concerted action of three enzyme families. The E2 ubiquitin conjugase UBCH8 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme [human] 8) cooperates with the E3 ubiquitin ligases SIAH1 and SIAH2 (seven in absentia homolog 1/2) to mediate the proteasomal degradation of oncoproteins. One such protein is the leukemia fusion protein PML–RARα (promyelocytic leukemia–retinoic acid receptorα) that is associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia. A limited number of UBCH8 interaction partners that participate in the UBCH8-dependent depletion of cancer-relevant proteins are known. We report here that TRIAD1 (two RING fingers and DRIL [double RING finger linked] 1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase relevant for the clonogenic growth of myloid progenitors, binds UBCH8 as well as PML–RARα. Moreover, there is concurrent induction of TRIAD1 and UBCH8 upon combinatorial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells with the pro-apoptotic epigenetic modulator valproic acid and the differentiation inducing agent all-trans retinoic acid. However, in sharp contrast to SIAH1/SIAH2 and UBCH8, TRIAD1 binding to PML–RARα has no effect on its turnover. In summary, our data exclude TRIAD1 as crucial regulator of the leukemic determinant PML–RARα, but highlight the prominence of the UBCH8/SIAH axis in PML–RARα degradation.

Abstract: Time stability of dye-sensitized solar cells based on ZnO sphere aggregates sensitized by N719 was systematically investigated. Eight cells in two groups were involved in this study. Each group has four cells that were connected in series and were used to supply the power to a light emission diode. Group 1 was kept in a room and Group 2 was kept outside ambient condition. The duration was half a year. The cells of the two groups can maintain about 90% of their initial efficiency after half a year running. The decrease of efficiency mainly results from about 15% drop of current density in the first week. Then the current density remained unvaried in the following days no matter whether the cells were kept in the room or outside ambient condition. The open-circuit voltages of these cells increased from 0.67–0.72 to 0.71–0.76V in the first week and then kept unvaried in the following operation. These results indicate an excellent time stability of DSCs based on aggregates of ZnO spheres sensitized by N719 and suggest a great potential for practice use.

Abstract: For the first time, based on the known optical constants of the materials (refractive index and extinction coefficient), calculations of optical losses in glass/transparent conducting oxide (TCO)/CdS/CdTe solar cells have been carried out taking into account reflections at the interfaces and absorption in the TCO (it can be indium tin oxide (ITO) or SnO2:F) and CdS layers. It has been shown that the losses caused by reflections at the interfaces result in lowering the short-circuit current by ∼9 % whereas absorption in the TCO and CdS layers with the typical thicknesses lead to losses of 15–16% for glass/SnO2/CdS/CdTe, and 22–24% for glass/ITO/CdS/CdTe solar cells. At 100% photoelectric conversion in the CdTe absorber layer, this corresponds to a loss in short-circuit current by ∼3mA/cm2 due to reflection, and 4–7mA/cm2 due to absorption at the glass/SnO2(or ITO)/CdS stack. Losses due to absorption in float glass and low-iron glasses are 3.3–3.5% and 0.6–0.7%, respectively.

Abstract: The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway plays important roles in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis, and is tightly controlled by a network of biomolecules. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs of ∼22 nucleotides that regulate gene expression at posttranscriptional levels. Increasing evidence points to the important role of miRNAs in TGF-β signaling. OncomicroRNA miR-21 has been established as a key regulator of mesenchymal phenotype transition induced by TGF-β. However, the effects of miR-21 on epithelial biology involved in TGF-β signaling pathway such as cytostatic program and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes are unclear. Here we show that miR-21 is upregulated after TGF-β exposure in both growth inhibition and EMT models of HaCaT keratinocytes. To determine the potential roles of miR-21 in TGF-β-induced growth-arrest and EMT models, we showed that ectopic expression of miR-21 overcame TGF-β′ growth-inhibitory effect and the knockdown of miR-21 potentialized this effect, but perturbation of miR-21 levels had little effect on EMT. Moreover, TGFBR2, PTEN, PDCD4, and TAp63 were identified as targets of miR-21 in HaCaT cells. And among them, TGFBR2, PTEN, and TAp63 were associated with TGF-β-induced cytostatic program. Thus, our results suggest that miR-21 regulates the ability of epithelial cells to respond to TGF-β, with potential impact on epithelium homeostasis, wound-healing and tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Prostaglandins, the products of arachidonic acid release and oxidation by phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenases (COX) 1 and 2 respectively, are known as important inflammation mediators. However, their diversity in structure, properties and cell specificity make their physiological function difficult to define. In the lung, the prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) metabolite 15d-PGJ2 is known to modulate the properties of a large number of intracellular compounds, leading to both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. In the lung, the serous sub-mucosal glands, that strongly express CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), play an important role in the defence against inflammation, and their derivatives Calu-3 cells are largely used in in vitro experiments. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the PGD synthase-PGD2-15d-PGJ2 pathway is active in Calu-3 cells, and whether its activity requires a functional CFTR. Both cellular and released PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 were measured in cells treated with CFTR inhibitors and stimulated or not with inflammatory IL-1β. Pretreatment with either CFTRinh172 or GlyH101 inhibitors decreased the basal cell content of both prostaglandins, and so did acute stimulation with IL-1β, but the latter was dramatically reversed in CFTRinh172-treated cells. CFTRinh172 also altered the release of inflammation mediators PGE2 and IL-8, and this effect was blunted by exogenous 15d-PGJ2. CFTRinh172-induced modulation of 15d-PGJ2 cellular content was not detected in CFTR-silenced Calu-3 cells, but it was reproduced in pulmonary CFBE41o-cells, which express F508del-CFTR. These results show that cellular 15d-PGJ2 production, which controls PGE2 and IL-8 release, is disturbed by CFTR dysfunction. In Calu-3 cells, 15d-PGJ2 production resulted from COX-2-regulated COX-1 activation, while CFTRinh172-induced alteration of 15d-PGJ2 synthesis involved both decreased expression of PGD synthase and disturbed relationships between both COXs. CFTR-mediated regulation of PGD synthase-PGD2-15d-PGJ2 pathway and cellular 15d-PGJ2 effects may involve a large number of molecular reactive pathways. Their exploration should help understand the development of CF inflammation and might bring new perspectives in its treatment.

Abstract: Conjugated polymers play an increasingly relevant role in a large number of technological applications (organic solar cells, electrochromic devices, OLEDs). Such preeminence is as much a consequence of their peculiar optoelectronic properties as it is of the possibility to be solution processed. In fact, although unfunctionalized conjugated polymers are almost insoluble, an extensive functionalization with suitable solubilizing chains conveys the required solution processability as well as good adhesion properties with respect to a number of different substrates. The chemical nature (polar, nonpolar) length and branching of the chains do not sizably influence the electronic properties of the polymer, but plays a major role in the solid-state morphology. We here present a systematic study on the role of the solubilizing chains in the overall performances of a series of electropolymerized 2,2′-{thiene-2,5-diylbis[(E)ethene-2,1-diyl]}bis(1H-pyrrole) derivatives. In particular, we show how the nature and length of the chain play a relevant role on the electrochemical behavior of the polymers. Our results can be rationalized in terms of lateral chain induced noncovalent interactions. Finally, the spectroelectrochemical properties of some of these polymers could be of interest for NIR-operating variable optical attenuators.

Multiple ways to die: Delineation of the unfolded protein response and apoptosis induced by Surfactant Protein C BRICHOS mutants,

Abstract: Epithelial cell dysfunction is now recognized as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung diseases. Surfactant Protein C (SP-C), an alveolar type II cell specific protein, has contributed to this concept with the observation that heterozygous expression of SFTPC gene mutations are associated with chronic interstitial lung disease. We have shown that transient expression of aggregation prone mutant SP-C isoforms (SP-C BRICHOS) destabilize ER quality control mechanisms resulting in the intracellular accumulation of aggregating propeptide, inhibition of the ubiquitin/proteasome system, and activation of apoptosis. The goal of the present study was to define signaling pathways linking the unfolded protein response (UPR) and subsequent ER stress with intrinsic apoptosis events observed following mutant SP-C expression. In vitro expression of the SP-C BRICHOS mutant, SP-CΔexon4, was used as a model system. Here we show stimulation of a broad ER stress response in both transfected A549 and HEK293 cells with activation of all 3 canonical sensing pathways, IRE1/XBP-1, ATF6, and PERK/eIF2α. SP-CΔexon4 expression also resulted in activation of caspase 3, but failed to stimulate expression of the apoptosis mediating transcription factors ATF4/CHOP. However, inhibition of either caspase 4 or c-jun kinase (JNK) each blocked caspase 3 mediated cell death. Taken together, these results suggest that expression of SP-C BRICHOS mutants induce apoptosis through multiple UPR signaling pathways, and provide new therapeutic targets for the amelioration of ER stress induced cytotoxicity observed in fibrotic lung remodeling.

Abstract: Aqueous-dispersible graphene (a-dG) sheets were fabricated by reducing the graphite oxide (GO) nanosheets in water in the presence of poly [3-(potassium-6-hexanoate) thiophene-2, 5-diyl] (P3KT) through noncovalent functionalization. The successful reduction of GO was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The obvious fluorescence quenching of P3KT by a-dG in the solid films due to the efficient charge transfer between P3KT and a-dG demonstrated that a-dG could be expected to be used as the electron acceptor in the polymer solar cell (PSC) devices. “Green” PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/P3KT: a-dG/ZnO/Al, where P3KT acts as donor, aqueous-dispersible noncovalent functionalized graphene sheets as acceptor and ZnO as both electron transporting and hole blocking layer, have been fabricated using water as the solvent for the active layer. The short-circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices with P3KT: a-dG composite film as the active layer increased compared with those of the devices with P3KT pure film as the active layer, which indicated that a-dG can be used as the electron acceptor in PSCs.

Abstract: Efficient and stable Bulk Heterojunction polymer solar cells based on a P3HT:PC61BM active layer have been fabricated by inserting a convenient, low cost, solution-processed, PEDOT/PSS anode buffer layer doped with solution-processed MoO3. The MoO3 consist of small “islands” in the blend film extends the interfacial contact area between the P3HT:PC61BM and PEDOT/PSS to facilitate hole collection, and meanwhile blocking electron transport at the anode. Hence the improved Jsc and FF dramatically increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 2.98% to 3.94%. After anode buffer layer doped with the MoO3, the device stability also has a significant improvement.

Abstract: We report the realization of a prototype solar cell based on a ZnO/ZnSe core/shell nanowire array. The ZnO/ZnSe core/shell nanowire forms a type II heterojunction that can have an effective bandgap much below that of either component. The nanowire array architecture offers strong enhancement in light absorption through increasing the junction area and light trapping. The device shows a photo-response threshold of ∼1.6eV and a large open circuit voltage of 0.7V. Type II optical transition at the ZnO/ZnSe interface is further confirmed by transmission, photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence. This result opens up new options in selecting the absorber material for a solar cell.

Abstract: The protection of the developing organism from oxidative damage is ensured by antioxidant defense systems to cope with reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn can be influenced by dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). PUFAs in membrane phospholipids are substrates for ROS-induced peroxidation reactions. We investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities in rat cerebrum, liver and uterus. Pups born from dams fed a diet low in omega-3 PUFAs were fed at weaning a diet supplying low α-linolenic acid (ALA), adequate ALA or enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Malondialdehyde (MDA), a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, and the activities of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), SOD2, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined in the three target organs. Compared to low ALA feeding, supplementation with adequate ALA or with EPA+DHA did not affect the cerebrum MDA content but increased MDA content in liver. Uterine MDA was increased by the EPA+DHA diet. Supplementation with adequate ALA or EPA+DHA increased SOD2 activity in the liver and uterus, while only the DHA diet increased SOD2 activity in the cerebrum. SOD1, CAT and GPX activities were not altered by ALA or EPA+DHA supplementation. Our data suggest that increased SOD2 activity in organs of the growing female rats is a critical determinant in the tolerance to oxidative stress induced by feeding a diet supplemented with omega-3 PUFAs. This is may be a specific cellular antioxidant response to ROS production within the mitochondria.

Abstract: Although silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been reported to exert strong acute toxic effects on various cultured cells by inducing oxidative stress, the molecular mechanisms by which AgNPs-damaged cells are unknown. Because the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may play an important role in the response to oxidative stress-induced damage and is quite sensitive to oxidative damage, we hypothesized that AgNPs may exert cytotoxic effects on cells by modulating ER stress. In our study, AgNPs resulted in cytotoxicity and apoptotic cell death when analyzing cell viability, DNA fragmentation and the apoptotic sub-G1 population. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy indicated that the cells were sensitive to AgNPs with respect to the induction of mitochondrial Ca2+ overloading and enhancement of ER stress. AgNPs induced a number of signature ER stress markers, including phosphorylation of RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) and its downstream eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, phosphorylation of inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), splicing of ER stress-specific X-box transcription factor-1, cleavage of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and up-regulation of glucose-regulated protein-78 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein–homologous protein (CHOP/GADD153). Down-regulation of PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 expression using siRNA significantly decreased AgNPs-induced the enhancement of ER stress. In addition, down-regulation of CHOP expression with siRNA CHOP attenuated AgNPs-induced apoptosis. Taken together, the present study supports an important role for the ER stress response in mediating AgNPs-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Efficient core–shell TCO/a-Si/Si nanowires (SiNWs) heterojunction solar cells were fabricated on SiNW arrays prepared by metal assisted wet chemical etching of an n-type silicon wafer. The silver catalyst was carefully removed after the etching by a three-step procedure. A stack of intrinsic and p-type amorphous-Si (a-Si) was deposited as a shell onto the SiNW arrays by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and finally, a ∼200nm TCO layer was deposited on top of the a-Si layer by atomic layer deposition (ALD). No shunt was detected in our cells, which was a big problem in the cells prepared on similar substrates published in the literature. The core–shell heterojunction solar cells on nanowire arrays also show great improvement of the performance in comparison with those published previously. In a mesa-structured solar cell with contact area of 7mm2, an open circuit voltage of 476mV, short circuit current density of 27mA/cm2, filling factor of 56.2% and conversion efficiency of 7.29% was determined at AM 1.5. Electron beam induced current (EBIC) measurements were performed on the solar cells, which demonstrate unambiguously that the nanowire arrays work as active photovoltaic components.

Abstract: A study of the molecular structure of regio-regular bulk poly-3-octyl-thiophene (P3OT) and poly-3-hexyl-thiophene (P3HT) and the phase transitions during heating and cooling scans in a temperature range of –158–773°C has been performed by means of calorimetry of bulk samples and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction from synchrotron radiation. Additional calorimetric measurements were performed on samples in toluene solution. From the calorimetric temperature diagrams at different scan rates, we obtain the melting and crystallization temperatures, and we identify a low temperature calorimetric glass transition. This transition is expected because of the coexistence of amorphous and crystalline phases, which is further supported by scanning force microscopy images where lamellar structures have been observed. Thin films of both polymers have also been studied by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, and the evolution of the (100) crystalline peak monitored as a function of sample temperature, showing different behavior in both polymers, d-spacing increases in P3HT and decreases in P3OT for increasing temperatures. The information presented in this article will be useful to design fabrication techniques for organic-based electronic devices, which could include high and low temperature cycles combined with structural quenching procedures.

Abstract: For deposition of a-Si:H p–i–n solar cells, a single-chamber plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process at the frequency of 13.56MHz is developed. A 40×40cm² deposition chamber, which represents typical industry reactors equipped with showerhead electrodes is employed. Various methods are applied to reduce the boron-cross contamination from the boron-doped p-layer into the intrinsic layer, which is considered to reduce solar cell efficiency by losses especially in the short wavelength range. Three different device configurations and four different chamber treatment methods are studied, aimed to reach stable device efficiencies comparable to multi-chamber systems at minimum chamber treatment effort and treatment time. An ex-situ CO2–plasma treatment applied after deposition of the p-doped layer is found to be effective to reduce boron-cross contamination. However, this CO2-treatment is a time-consuming process step for production. We found a less time consuming treatment: by a chamber evacuation to 9×10−7mbar subsequent to p-layer deposition. Initial and stable efficiencies of 10.2% and 7.7%, respectively, were obtained. This latter treatment results in a sharp drop of the boron concentration from ∼5×1020cm−3 in the p-doped layer to ∼1017cm−3 in the intrinsic layer. For comparison of different reactor geometries and their influence on the cross-contamination we used a small-area (10×10cm2) lab-type reactor.

Abstract: Plasmonic excitation enhanced fluorescence of CdSe/ZnS core-shell quantum dots (QDs) in the presence of Au nanoparticles (NPs) has been studied for application in quantum dot solar concentrator (QDSC) devices. We observe that there is an optimal concentration of Au NPs that gives a maximum 53% fluorescence emission enhancement for the particular QD/Au NP composite studied. The optimal concentration depends on the coupling and spacing between neighboring QDs and Au NPs. We show the continuous transition from fluorescence enhancement to quenching, depending on Au NP concentration. The locally enhanced electromagnetic field induced by the surface plasmon resonance in the Au NPs leads to an increased excitation rate for the QDs. This is evidenced by excitation wavelength dependent fluorescence enhancement, where the locally enhanced field around the Au NPs is more pronounced close to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) wavelength. However, at higher concentrations of Au NPs non-radiative energy transfer from the QDs to the Au NPs particles leads to a decrease of the emission, which is confirmed by detection of both a double exponential lifetime decay in, and a decrease in the lifetime of the QDs. The overall fluorescence emission enhancement depends on these competing effects; increased excitation rate and non-radiative energy transfer.

Abstract: There is now compelling evidence that members of the family of small heat shock proteins (HSP) can be secreted by a variety of different types of cells. Secretion of small HSP may at times represent altruistic delivery of supporting and stabilizing factors from one cell to another. A probably more general effect of extracellular small HSP, however, is exerted by their ability to activate macrophages and macrophage-like cells. When doing so, small HSP induce an immune-regulatory state of activation, stimulating macrophages to suppress inflammation. For this reason, small HSP deserve consideration as broadly applicable therapeutic agents for inflammatory disorders. In one particular case, however, adaptive immune responses to the small HSP itself may subvert the protective quality of the innate immune response it triggers. This situation only applies to alpha B-crystallin, and is unique for humans as well. In this special case, local concentrations of alpha B-crystallin determine the balance between protective innate responses and destructive adaptive responses, the latter of which are held responsible for the development of multiple sclerosis lesions. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Small HSPs in physiology and pathology.

Abstract: The expression of small heat shock proteins is tightly regulated during development in multiple organisms. As housekeeping proteins, small heat shock proteins help protect cells from apoptosis, stabilize the cytoskeleton and contribute to proteostasis. Consistently, depletion of one small heat shock protein is usually not detrimental due to a certain level of redundancy between the functions of each small heat shock protein. However, while their stress-induced expression is regulated by heat shock factors, their constitutive expression is under the control of other specific transcription factors, suggesting the existence of very specialized functions. This review focuses on the expression patterns and functions of small heat shock proteins in various organisms during development. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Small HSPs in physiology and pathology.

Abstract: UTF1 (undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1) is a marker for the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. We found that UTF1-deficient clones, which were isolated from P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, showed higher neuron-differentiating potentials than the parental cell line. Consistent with this result, suppression of UTF1 expression in P19 cells by RNA interference enhanced retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuronal differentiation. Moreover, reconstitution of UTF1 expression in UTF1-deficient clones decreased their ability to undergo neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, the growth rates of UTF1-deficient P19 cells did not differ from that of parental cells in adherent cultures, but were increased in embryoid bodies during RA-induced differentiation. Furthermore, different from the parental cells, UTF1-deficient P19 clones could proceed to neuronal differentiation without forming embryoid bodies. Based on these results we proposed that endogenous UTF1 prevented P19 EC cells from neuronal differentiation, and that the loss of UTF1 directed EC cells toward the neuronal fate.

Abstract: A double-layer antireflection (AR) coating fabricated using the single Indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive material is proposed. The high refractive index of the bottom ITO layer was achieved by long-throw radio-frequency magnetron sputtering technique at room temperature. On the other hand, the top ITO layer with low refractive index was prepared by applying supercritical CO2 (SCCO2) treatment at 60°C on gel-coated ITO thin films. Porous structures were obtained with the SCCO2 treatment to volatilize or extract organic matters from the films. Their refractive indices were precisely controlled by varying the sputtering power and the operation pressure of the long-throw sputtering and the SCCO2 treatment, respectively. Weighted average reflectance and average transmittance of 4.3% and 86.2% were achieved for the double-layer ITO AR electrode. In addition, the sheet resistance of the AR electrode is 1.14kΩ/□ with 65nm thick porous ITO layer on 75nm thick sputtered ITO layer.

Abstract: Transparent and conductive Al-doped ZnO (AZO) thin films were deposited by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis of alcoholic solutions in ambient atmosphere without any post-growth treatment. Spraying parameters, composition and acidity of the sprayed solution, and doping level were systematically investigated in order to obtain AZO films suitable for applications in solar cells. It was confirmed that the amount of aluminum chloride as the dopant and acetic acid as the stabilizing agent are decisive for film morphology and opto-electrical properties. Films of 1.1μm in thickness deposited under optimized conditions on borosilicate substrates exhibited resistivity of 5×10−3Ωcm and an average transmittance of 82% in the wavelength range 400–900nm. A resistivity of 3×10−3Ωcm, one of the lowest values reported in literature for sprayed AZO, was obtained for a film thickness of 3μm maintaining a high optical transmittance of >74%. The latter film was applied as a transparent electrical contact in a CdTe solar cell and an efficiency of 12.1% without antireflection coating was achieved. The average efficiency value of >11% measured for 22 fabricated solar cells demonstrates the feasibility of using spray-pyrolysis technique for the deposition of large area AZO contacts for solar cell applications.

Abstract: Although C60 is unquestionably not only the cheapest but also the most energy-saving fullerene, lack of suitable solvent to make bulk heterojunction composites with it has prevented its use in photocells. Here, it is shown that a not-so-common organic solvent 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB) is useful to prepare cost-effective bulk heterojunction composites based on C60. Additionally, chlorine-free TMB is expected to be environmental friendly compared with chloroaromatic solvents commonly used for the preparation of polymer/fullerene composites. A preliminary evaluation indicated that a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/C60 bulk heterojunction photocell prepared from TMB solution shows power conversion efficiency comparable to that of a P3HT/PCBM photocell, suggesting that C60 should be revisited as a promising candidate for an acceptor material in polymer bulk heterojunction composites for low-cost green photocells.

Abstract: In this study, optical simulations have been performed based on a transfer matrix method (TMM) to investigate the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Then, the organic solar cells of configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CuPc/C60/EBL/Cu (Indium Tin Oxide/poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonic acid/fullerene/Copper phthalocyanine/Exciton Blocking Layer(EBL)/Copper) were investigated. It is found that the performance of the cells gets slightly enhanced during the first 25min after fabrication, and gradually declines afterwards. Therefore, all cells were removed from the vacuum after 25min and encapsulated by YF3. Then, the influence of a buffer layer such as lithium fluoride (LiF), bathocuproine (BCP), 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen), tris-8-hydroxy-quinolinato aluminium (Alq3) and CuPc was studied on the performance of OSCs. The highest efficiency was obtained for the devices with BCP or Bphen as their buffer layer. In particular, a half-lifetime of 90 days in air at ambient circumstance was achieved for LiF and CuPc as buffer layers.

Abstract: Electro-spray (e-spray) is emerging as an attractive printing method because of its simple apparatus and high productivity for the thin-film fabrication of conjugated polymer materials. We report here a study of the e-spray deposition conditions of highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films. The highest conductivity of 800S/cm was achieved by independently optimizing the process parameters such as the solvent dilution ratio, the amount of additive, and the substrate temperature. Although the conductivity was largely governed by the morphologies of the deposited films, we found that in e-spray deposition, pure electrical scattering (irrespective of the specific morphology) also influenced the macroscopic conductivities. Using the optimized e-spraying conditions, we fabricated a top PEDOT:PSS electrode for a semitransparent inverted organic solar cells (OSCs) without any performance degradation in the underlying photoactive layer.

Abstract: Cellular potassium homeostasis has recently emerged as a critical regulator of apoptosis in response to variety of stimuli. However, functional hierarchy of this phenomenon in the apoptotic cascade and therefore, its significance as a pathway for intervention is not fully established. Chronic hypoxia, a known threat to cell survival, also modulates cellular potassium homeostasis. In this study, we tested if hypoxia-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes can be prevented by modulating cellular K+ homeostasis. We observed that chronic hypoxia accelerated the rate of apoptosis in resting murine splenocytes concomitant with cytosolic K+ efflux. We tested several modalities including elevated extracellular potassium besides various K+ channel inhibitors to curtail hypoxia-induced K+ efflux and interestingly, established that the supplementation of KCl in extracellular medium was most effective in preventing hypoxia-induced apoptosis in these cells. Subsequent mechanistic dissection of pathways underlying this phenomenon revealed that besides effectively inhibiting hypoxia-induced efflux of K+ ion and its downstream cell-physiological consequences; elevated extracellular KCl modulated steady state levels of cellular ATP and culminated in stabilization of AMPKα with pro-survival consequences. Also, interestingly, global gene expression profiling revealed that KCl supplementation down regulated a distinct p53-regulated cellular sub-network of genes involved in regulation of DNA replication. Additionally, we present experimental evidence for the functional role of AMPK and p53 activation during suppression of hypoxia-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our study highlights a novel bimodal effect wherein cooperativity between restoration of K+ homeostasis and a sustainable ‘metabolic quiescence’ induced by AMPK activation appeared indispensible for curtailing hypoxia-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Both the performance and stability are the two major tasks for scientists to tackle in polymer solar cells. We introduce 3-hydroxyflavone (3-HF), a free-radical scavenging agent, as an additive in poly(3-hexythiophene):(6,6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) blend forming new photoactive material, which is used as an active layer in inverted solar cell devices. It was found that the addition of an adequate amount of 3-HF enhances the photocurrent, which is due to the improved carrier mobility. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device has improved from 2.57% to 3.05%. In addition, 3-HF can further stabilize the inverted solar cell performance with a 85% retaining of its original PCE over a month in ambient condition as compared to the additive-free device of a value of 57%. Thus, incorporating 3-HF as an additive is an effective and simple method to approach the goal of high PCE while maintaining stable ambient operation.

Abstract: Indium is a scarce and expensive material that has been identified as a bottleneck for future organic electronics deployment in large scale. Indium is the main constituent of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), which is the most successful transparent electrode in organic photovoltaics (OPV) so far. A new process, termed Hiflex, allows for manufacture of flexible OPV modules where the ITO electrode has been replaced by a sputtered Al/Cr electrode in an inverted device architecture with front illumination. This work presents a life cycle assessment of the Hiflex process, in order to compare the environmental impact of avoiding ITO as electrode. The new ITO-free process reduces some of the processing steps, leading to important reductions of the energy input during OPV module manufacturing in comparison to ITO-based modules. The environmental analysis reveals an Energy Pay-Back time (EPBT) of 10 years due to the high-energy consumption of Al/Cr roll-to-roll sputtering and to the relatively low efficiency of the Hiflex OPV modules (≈1%). An optimization of the active area fraction could easily reduce the EPBT to ≈5 years. A further enhancement of the efficiency to 5% would give rise to a promising EPBT of only 1 year. Our work highlights that vacuum processing steps should be avoided.

Abstract: In this work, the generation and stability of defects in molybdenum oxide (MoO3) is studied in detail. We found that the defects generated by annealing are typically more stable against re-oxidation by plasma treatment when compared with the sputtered defects. Against air exposure, the annealed defects are also highly stable showing little re-oxidation even after long exposures. The sputtered defects however showed prominent decrease of the defect states and the kinetics can be classified into two regimes with different rate constants. The reason behind the difference in stability can be attributed to the different types of bonding for the generated defects. Following this, we fabricated two forward solar cells with an as-deposited MoO3 and another with intentionally generated defects. We obtained a higher short circuit current (Jsc) when the generated defects are present and the overall efficiency is increased by ∼50%. We propose that the presence of the defects acted as an additional pathway for holes extraction and highlights the important role that surface defects play in enhancement of device performances.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the performances of flexible all-polymer electroemissive devices as active materials for thermal control of satellites. These devices are made of a semi-interpenetrating network of poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEO/PEDOT) where PEDOT is embedded within the PEO network and swollen with an ionic liquid. The reflectivity at 2.5μm and the emissivity in the infrared region between 5 and 50μm were measured at room temperature as well as the stability in vacuum. It was thus pointed out that these films exhibit interesting switching properties as notably a maximal emissivity contrast of 0.31 with a switching time less than 3min. Moreover a low energy was required (473Jm−²) to modulate the emissivity of the devices.

Abstract: This work investigates the loss in performance induced by molecular oxygen in bulk heterojunction solar cells. We observe that upon exposure to molecular oxygen both formation of P3HT+:O2− complex and metal oxidation at the interface between the active layer and metallic contact occur. These two different effects were separately investigated using NOBF4 as an oxidant. Our procedure has allowed studying p-doping of the active layer independently from contact degradation. A loss in photocurrent is associated with formation of P3HT+:O2− complex, which reduces the concentration of neutral P3HT present in the film in accordance with absorption and external quantum efficiency spectra. This complex is regarded as a source of a pathway of reversible degradation. Capacitance–voltage measurements allow for an accurate extraction of p-doping levels of the active layer produced by the presence of charged O2− species. In addition, one of the irreversible degradation pathways is identified to be oxidation of the metallic contact to form CaO. This oxide forms a thin dipole layer producing a voltage drop across the active layer/Ca interface, which has a direct impact on the open circuit voltage and fill factor.

Abstract: Two series of P3HT-based polymer solar cell (PSCs) only with different electron acceptors PC70BM or PC60BM were investigated under the same conditions. The PSCs with PC70BM as the electron acceptor exhibit a relatively strong and broad absorption in the visible range and high external quantum efficiency, which results in a relatively high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.62V, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.85mA/cm2 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.52%. The PSCs with PC60BM as the electron acceptor have a relatively low Voc of 0.58V, Jsc of 10.68mA/cm2 and PCE of 3.02% due to the weak absorption of PC60BM in the visible light range. The function of PC70BM instead of PC60BM as electron acceptor could be summarized as follows: i) the strong absorption PC70BM in the visible range results in much more photon harvesting; ii) the relatively low electron mobility and relatively big size of PC70BM molecule influences the charge transporting and phase separation. The ultimate performances of PSCs are codetermined by the photon harvesting, exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport and collection.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells are an important prerequisite towards low cost photovoltaic fabricated in high throughput. In this work we suggest indane as a non-halogenated replacement for the commonly used halogenated solvent o-dichlorobenzene. Indane was blended with the higher volatile solvents chloroform or toluene or o-xylene in order to improve wettability and to reduce drying time. The combination of high volatile solvents with the less volatile host solvent indane allows for an increased fabrication speed due to a reduction of the overall drying time and provides films with good light absorption behavior and high polymer crystallinity. For the solvent mixture toluene–indane, solar cell performance is comparable to the o-dichlorobenzene reference device indicating this mixture as a suitable replacement for increased productivity without drawbacks in nanomorphology as investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD). This study provides a fundamental understanding on solvent mixture drying kinetics and can aid the ink formulation.

Abstract: Polo-like kinase 1 is a serine/threonine kinase which plays an essential role in mitosis and malignant transformation. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of polo-like kinase 1 expression and determine its possibility as a therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay was performed to detect polo-like kinase 1 mRNA expression in non-small cell lung cancer cells or tissues. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect polo-like kinase 1 protein expression in 100 non-small cell lung cancer tissue samples, and the associations of polo-like kinase 1 expression with clinicopathological factors or prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer patients were evaluated. RNA interference was employed to inhibit endogenous polo-like kinase 1 expression and analyzed the effects of polo-like kinase 1 inhibition on the malignant phenotypes of non-small cell lung cancer cells including growth, apoptosis, radio- or chemoresistance. Also, the possible molecular mechanisms were also investigated. The levels of polo-like kinase 1 mRNA expression in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines or tissues were significantly higher than those in normal human bronchial epithelial cell line or corresponding non-tumor tissues. High polo-like kinase 1 expression was significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage, higher tumor classification and lymph node metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer patients (P=0.001, 0.004 and 0.001, respectively). Meanwhile, high polo-like kinase 1 protein expression was also an independent prognostic molecular marker for non-small cell lung cancer patients (hazard ratio: 2.113; 95% confidence interval: 1.326–3.557; P=0.017). Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition could significantly inhibit in vitro and in vivo proliferation, induce cell arrest of G2/M phase and apoptosis enhancement in non-small cell lung cancer cells, which might be activation of the p53 pathway and the Cdc25C/cdc2/cyclin B1 feedback loop. Further, inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 could enhance the sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells to taxanes or irradiation. Thus, polo-like kinase 1 might be a prognostic marker and a chemo- or radiotherapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancer.

Abstract: Low cost and ease of fabrication are important factors for solar-thermal applications in energy-efficient buildings. This contribution reports the influence of oxygen on structure, optical properties and chromaticity of TiAlOxNy thin films prepared by DC magnetron sputtering. It is an extension of a previous study on colored solar-thermal absorbers based on titanium–aluminum nitride. The purpose is to investigate the possibility of using TiAlOxNy as middle layer to achieve a gradient effect. The results reveal that the structure and optical properties of the TiAlOxNy coatings are sensitive to the oxygen content under certain sputtering conditions. The ratio of oxygen/nitrogen of 0.7:10 is the most appropriate to form the crystalline structure of TiAlON. The optical constants of TiAlN and TiAlON were deduced by fitting the experimental data. It shows that both the refractive index (n) and the extinction coefficient (κ) are decreased when oxygen is introduced to form titanium–aluminum nitro-oxide. The gradient effect can be achieved and controlled by adjusting the ratio of oxygen/nitrogen flow during the process to enhance solar absorptance while keeping the desired color appearance.

Abstract: Glycine receptor chloride channels are Cys-loop receptor proteins that isomerize between a low affinity closed state and a high affinity ion-conducting state. There is currently much interest in understanding the mechanisms that link affinity changes with conductance changes. This essentially involves an agonist binding in the glycine receptor ligand-binding site initiating local conformational changes that propagate in a wave towards the channel gate. However, it has proved difficult to convincingly distinguish those agonist-induced domain movements that are critical for triggering activation from those that are simply local deformations to accommodate ligands in the site. We employed voltage-clamp fluorometry to compare conformational changes in the ligand-binding site in response to activation by glycine, which binds locally, and ivermectin, which binds in the transmembrane domain. We reasoned that ivermectin-mediated activation should initiate a conformational wave that propagates from the pore-lining domain towards the ligand-binding domain, eliciting conformational changes in those extracellular domains that are allosterically linked to the gate. We found that ivermectin indeed elicited conformational changes in ligand-binding domain loops C, D and F. This implies that conformational changes in these domains are important for activation. This result also provides a mechanism to explain how ivermectin potentiates glycine-induced channel activation.

Abstract: 1,4-Bis(3-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzene monomer was successfully synthesized via Suzuki coupling reaction. Poly(1,4-bis(3-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzene) (PBMTB) was electrochemically synthesized and characterized. Characterizations of the resulting polymer PBMTB were performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, the spectroelectrochemical and electrochromic properties of the polymer film were investigated. The resulting polymer film has distinct electrochromic properties and shows three different colors (yellow, yellowish green and blue) under various potentials. The PBMTB film shows a maximum optical contrast (ΔT%) of 58% at 630nm with a response time of 1.11s. The coloration efficiency (CE) of PBMTB film was calculated to be 107cm2C−1. An electrochromic device (ECD) based on PBMTB and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was also constructed and characterized. The optical contrast (ΔT%) at 606nm was found to be 50% and response time was measured as 0.41s. The CE of the device was calculated to be 365.6cm2C−1. This ECD has satisfactory optical memories and redox stability.

Abstract: The present study demonstrated the direct application of poly(3-hexylthiophene) benzyl-di-n-octylphosphine oxide (P3HT-DOPO) functionalized ZnO nanoparticles (P3HT-DOPO@ZnO) as active layer of hybrid bulk heterojunction solar cells. P3HT-DOPO@ZnO Scheme 1 nanocomposites were synthesized by direct grafting of P3HT-DOPO, which was prepared via Suzuki-Miyaura reaction between P3HT-Br and p-benzyl-di-n-octylphosphine oxide acid. The resulting P3HT-DOPO@ZnO nanocomposites possess a well-defined interface, thus significantly promoting the dispersion of ZnO nanoparticles within the P3HT matrix and facilitating the electronic interaction between these two components, resulting in a more efficient photoinduced charge transfer than that of in physical mixture of P3HT and ZnO nanoparticles. The hybrid photovoltaic device of P3HT-DOPO@ZnO performance exhibited an improved device efficiencies as high as 0.077%, with Jsc=1.05mA/cm2, Voc=0.34V and a FF=0.22 under AM 1.5G illumination with 100mW/cm2 light intensity.

Abstract: Freshly isolated human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are small and round cells which upon cultivation adopt a polarized morphology and redistribute certain cell surface antigens. To functionally dissect this polarization process, we addressed impacts of protein synthesis, HSPC trafficking, cytoskeleton organization or lipid raft integrity on the establishment and maintenance of the cell polarity of human HSPCs. Effects on the morphology, sub-cellular distribution of lipid raft-associated molecular polarization markers (Flotillin-1, Flotillin-2, ICAM-3) and in vitro migration capabilities of treated cells were studied. We could distinguish two levels of cellular polarization, a molecular and a morphological level. Our data suggest that protein synthesis, lipid raft integrity and enzymatic activities of PI3K and aPKC are required to organize the molecular cell polarity. The morphological cell polarization process, however, also depends on actin polymerization and rho-GTPase activities. In summary, our data qualify HSPC polarization processes as new pharmaceutical target to interfere with migratory and with homing capabilities of HSPCs.

Secretion of the housekeeping protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by the LEE-encoded type III secretion system in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli,

Abstract: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a multifunctional housekeeping protein secreted by pathogens and involved in adhesion and/or virulence. Previously we reported that enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) and enteropathogenic (EPEC) Escherichia coli secrete GAPDH into the culture medium. This bacterial protein binds human plasminogen and fibrinogen and remains associated with Caco-2 cells upon infection. In these pathogens, GAPDH secretion is not linked to outer membrane vesicles and depends on growth conditions, although the secretion mechanism is still unknown. EPEC is an attaching and effacing pathogen able to secrete and translocate multiple effector proteins into infected cells through a type III secretion system (T3SS). The secretion process is often dependent on a bacterial chaperone. The chaperone CesT displays broad substrate specificity and plays a central role in the recruitment of multiple type III effectors to the T3SS apparatus. Here we provide genetic evidences on GAPDH secretion through T3SS by EPEC grown in DMEM. Secretion of GAPDH is increased in ΔsepD mutants and abolished in mutants defective in the type III ATPase EscN. Complementation with escN gene restores GAPDH secretion. In addition, we prove by means of pull down experiments, overlay immunoblotting and biolayer interferometry a novel interaction between GAPDH and the chaperone CesT. This interaction, which is strong and slow dissociating, may stabilize a population of GAPDH molecules in a secretion competent-state and target them to the type III secretion apparatus. This is the first description of CesT interaction with a housekeeping protein and its export through T3SS.

Abstract: α-Crystallin, a major component of the eye lens cytoplasm, is a large multimer formed from two members of the small heat shock protein (sHsp) family. Inherited crystallin mutations are a common cause of childhood cataract, whereas miscellaneous changes to the long-lived crystallins cause age-related cataract, the most common cause of blindness worldwide. Newly formed eye lens cells use proteostasis to deal with the consequences of mutations, whereas mature lens cells, devoid of the ATP-driven folding and degradation machines, are hypothesized to have the α-crystallin “holdase” chaperone function to prevent protein aggregation. We discuss the impact of truncating and missense mutations on α-crystallin, based on recent progress towards determining sHsp 3D structure. Dominant missense mutations to the “α-crystallin domain” of αA- (HSPB4) or αB-crystallin (HSPB5) occur on residues predicted to facilitate domain dynamics. αB-Crystallin is also expressed in striated muscle and mutations cause myopathy. The impact on these cellular cytoplasms is compared where sHsp multimer partners and metabolic constraints are different. Selected inherited mutations of the lens β- and γ-crystallins are considered in the context of their possible dependence on the “holdase” chaperone function of α-crystallin. Looking at discrete changes to specific crystallin polypeptide chains that can function as chaperone or substrate provide insights into the workings of a cytoplasmic proteostatic system. These observations provide a framework for validating the function of α-crystallin as a chaperone, or as a lens space filler adapted from a chaperone function. Understanding the mechanistic role of α-crystallins will aid progress in research into age-related cataract and adult-onset myopathy.

Abstract: In this study, thermal energy storage properties and thermal reliability some fatty acid esters/building material composites as novel form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) were investigated. The form-stable composite PCMs were prepared by absorbing galactitol hexa myristate (GHM) and galactitol hexa laurate (GHL) esters into porous networks of diatomite, perlite and vermiculite. In composite PCMs, fatty acid esters were used as energy storage materials while diatomite, perlite and vermiculite were used as building materials. The prepared composite PCMs were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR) analysis techniques. The SEM results proved that the esters were well confined into the building materials. The maximum mass percentages of GHM adsorbed by perlite, diatomite and vermiculite were determined as 67, 55 and 52wt%, respectively as they were found for GHL to be 70, 51 and 39wt%, respectively. Thermal properties and thermal stabilities of the form-stable composite PCMs were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The DSC results showed that the melting temperatures and latent heat values of the PCMs are in range of about 39–46°C and 61–121J/g. The thermal cycling test revealed that the composite PCMs have good thermal reliability and chemical stability. TG analysis revealed that the composite PCMs had high thermal durability property above their working temperature ranges. Moreover, the thermal conductivities of the PCMs were increased by adding the expanded graphite (EG) in mass fraction of 5%. Based on all results, it was also concluded that the prepared six composite PCMs had important potential for thermal energy storage applications such as solar space heating and cooling applications in buildings.

The results show that open-circuit voltage losses in bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells are affected from the diffusion enhancement inherent to disordered semiconductors. The model is validated by the fitting to recently published experimental data.

Abstract: Choroidal metastasis as an initial presenting feature of metastatic lung cancer is exceedingly rare. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is an effective and widely accepted therapeutic modality. However, data addressing the effectiveness of other treatment strategies is limited. We present a patient with choroidal metastases secondary to lung cancer and review the relevant literature. A 25-year-old male presented with deterioration of vision. His evaluation revealed bilateral choroidal metastasis secondary to adenocarcinoma of the lung. Unfortunately, his vision continued to deteriorate despite treatment with EBRT and chemotherapy. Choroidal metastasis as an initial presentation of metastatic lung cancer is exceedingly rare, as only 30 cases have been reported. EBRT and systemic chemotherapy are effective therapeutic modalities. This case report could prove helpful to clinicians faced with a similar exceedingly rare scenario.

Abstract: ZnO is a promising material for application in dye-sensitized solar cells, related to its attractive electrical properties and the facile preparation of nanomaterials, with excellent control over the structure and morphology. In this work ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells were prepared, and the effect of the presence of a compact ZnO interlayer between the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) electrode and the nanostructured, mesoporous ZnO film on the performance of the solar cell is reported. The compact interlayer was deposited using planar rf magnetron sputtering, and the ZnO nanomaterial was prepared by forced hydrolysis from zinc acetate in ethanol solution. The presence of the compact interlayer has a positive effect on the overall characteristics of the solar cell and decreases the recombination rate from the TCO substrate, resulting in a higher open circuit voltage under low light conditions. The best efficiency of non-optimized solar cells at 1 sun was 4.0%.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films are made using sulfurisation of co-sputtered metallic and sulfur-containing precursor films. The CZTS grain size is larger for metallic precursors than for sulfur-containing precursors while more uniform films with fewer voids are obtained in the latter case. During sulfurisation of precursors with tin-excess in closed quartz ampoules, tin is lost from the films with greater losses from metallic precursors. We suggest that the reduced grain size and the reduced tin-loss for sulfur-containing precursors can be explained by a larger number of CZTS nuclei being formed early in the sulfurisation process. In sulfur containing precursors with large tin excess, SnS2 is observed together with CZTS, and a tin-rich bottom layer segregates. This indicates that tin-diffusion in CZTS is relatively slow. Solar cell devices made for a range of compositions at and around stoichiometric CZTS show highest efficiencies in two compositional groups; Zn-rich and Cu-poor/Sn-rich, while close to stoichiometric material gives poor devices. Devices including the tin-rich bottom layer show efficiencies of up to 3.2%. The role of secondary phases such as ZnS and SnS2 on device performance is discussed.

Abstract: We report on cost-effective and ITO-free polymer solar cells (PSCs) fabricated on the copper (Cu) sheets consisting mainly of a Cu electrode and a polyimide substrate. The Cu electrode was used as a bottom cathode in inverted PSCs, and each layer above the Cu sheet was all-solution-processed. The work-functions of Cu electrodes were engineered with an interfacial dipole layer to enhance the device-performance. Highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (hcPEDOT:PSS) was used as a transparent top anode, and a photoactive layer was based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The fabricated PSCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼2.5%, demonstrating PSCs fabricated on Cu sheets have the great potential for cost-effective power generators. This study could be an important approach to the development of all-solution-processed and roll-to-roll PSCs using low-cost Cu electrodes as a cathode.

Abstract: A new solar selective absorbing coating of NbTiON/SiON was prepared on Cu substrate using a reactive magnetron sputtering method. The new coating exhibits a high absorptance (α) of 0.95 and a low emittance (ε) of 0.07, and the thickness of NbTiON and SiON layers was optimized to achieve high solar selectivity. The spectral properties (α/ε) of the coating on Cu substrate are stable (0.94/0.08) even after heat-treatment at 500°C in vacuum for 40h, but decreased at 600°C. If the substrate is replaced by stainless steel (SS), the coating exhibits better stability, which indicates its potential applications in intermediate temperate solar absorber.

Abstract: The dehydrogenation process of hydrogenated switchable mirrors using magnesium–nickel alloy thin film was studied in situ using spectroscopic ellipsometry. Ellipsometric angles Ψ and Δ of the switchable mirrors varied drastically as a result of dehydrogenation, which is a transformation from transparent to reflective states. The process was analyzed by dividing into the following three phases. The first phase was the dehydrogenation process of a thin Mg4Ni layer with several nanometers at a hydrogenated Pd/Mg4Ni interface. The second phase was the dehydrogenation processes of the hydrogenated Mg4Ni layer, which proceeded from the Pd/Mg4Ni interface to the substrate. The final phase was the desorption process of hydrogen, which was absorbed in Mg4Ni as solid solution and the dehydrogenation process was terminated.

Abstract: Photoelectrochromic (PEC) devices were assembled with an electrochemically deposited tungsten oxide (WO3) thin film on transparent conductive glass (ITO) substrates, a composite polymeric electrolyte (PE), and a Ruthenium 535 sensitized TiO2 sol–gel film deposited on ITO substrates. The polymeric electrolyte was prepared by the sol–gel method using a viscous polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW 600) and titanium isopropoxide as precursors in an acidic medium. A lithium salt (LiI) was added to the PEG–Ti complex for photoelectrochemical purposes. The color change of WO3 based PEC devices under 100mW/cm2 illumination at short circuit conditions indicates that the introduction of titanium complex inside the polymeric electrolyte accelerates the coloring speed from 26 to 9s. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses of PEC devices show that the presence of titanium complex in PE reduces the charge transfer resistance and increases the charge storage capacity of the cells. This improvement could come from the oxidation of iodides and reduction of titanium ions inside the composite electrolytes that increase the lithium ion's mobility.

Abstract: Nickel oxide (NiO) was thermally evaporated between the active layer and the top anode in inverted polymer solar cells. We demonstrate that NiO behaves as an anode buffer layer. The NiO thin film can module the Schottky barrier and form an ohmic contact at the organic/metal interface, which make it a great holes transport layer. The device performance with NiO of different thicknesses are investigated and compared. The results show that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases by fivefold with 2nm NiO compared to the control cell without NiO. The optimum device performance with 2nm NiO shows the Jsc of 7.92mA/cm2, Voc of 0.46V, FF of 39.8%, and thus the PCE of 1.45% under AM1.5G illumination of 100mW/cm2.

Abstract: We applied the horizontal electric field externally to improve the performances of organic solar cells based on the P3HT:PCBM heterojunction system. The treatment can orientate polymer materials and change the morphology of the active layer. Hence, the fill factor (FF) is enhanced from 63% to 67%. Furthermore, the treatment improves the morphology of the active layer. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the active layer is increased and the contact areas between the layer and the electrode become larger, which raises current density (JSC) from 9.14mA/cm2 to 9.55mA/cm2. Therefore, the device applied with horizontal electric field has better performance and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhances from 3.04% to 3.46%.

Abstract: A novel procedure based on the reactive evaporation method was developed to deposit highly transparent thin films of i-ZnO and n+-ZnO in-situ. The opto-electrical properties of the ZnO films were optimized for using them as TCO layer in solar cells. The optimization of the preparation parameters was achieved through a figure of merit defined in terms of both, the transmittance and the resistivity. n+-ZnO films with resistivities around 8×10−4Ωcm and i-ZnO films with resistivities around 105Ωcm and transmittances greater than 80% (in the visible region) were obtained with this method. The applicability of the i-ZnO and n+-ZnO thin films in photovoltaic devices has been demonstrated by using them as interdiffusion barrier and TCO layer in CuInS2 based solar cells. Conversion efficiencies of 9.1% were achieved with CIS based solar cells using ZnO thin films deposited by reactive evaporation.

Abstract: In this paper we present the physical properties of two types of multilayer structures: ITO/metal/ITO and ZnO/metal/ZnO obtained by successive sputtering depositions of metallic targets (In:Sn, Zn, Ag, Au) in reactive atmosphere (for oxide films) and under inert atmosphere (for metallic interlayer films). Very good quality transparent conducting thin films structures (ρ=2×10−5Ωcm, T∼90%) were obtained. The morphological, optical and electrical properties were analyzed and compared for the multilayer films deposited in identical conditions on glass and PET substrates. The influence of substrate nature on the morphological properties is more pronounced in the case of zinc oxide films. The Haake figures of merit at λ=550nm are comprised between 4×10−3Ω−1 and 29×10–3Ω−1 in function of the nature of the metallic interlayer. The stability of electrical properties with the temperature of the oxide/metal/oxide films is remarkable in comparison with the usual behavior of single oxide films.

Abstract: Ultra-thin Cd(1−x)Zn(x)S/CdTe devices were produced by atmospheric pressure metal organic chemical vapour deposition (AP-MOCVD) with varying CdTe absorber thicknesses ranging from 1.0 to 0.2μm and compared to baseline cells with total CdTe thickness of 2.25μm. The ultra-thin CdTe layers (≤1μm) were intentionally doped with As to induce p-type conductivity in the absorber. Cell performance reduced with CdTe thickness, with the magnitude of photo-current generation loss becoming more significant for the very thin CdTe layers. The decline in cell performance was lower than the optically limited performance relating to a decrease in shunt resistance, Rsh, especially for the thinnest cells due to areas of incomplete CdTe coverage and large presence of pin-holes leading to micro-shorts. Incorporation of Zn into the CdS window layer improved cell performance for all devices except when 0.2μm thick CdTe was used. This improvement was markedly in the blue region owing to enhanced optical transparency of the window layer. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements showed a red-shift of the window layer absorption edge due to leaching out of Zn during the CdCl2 treatment. Reduction of the CdCl2 deposition time was demonstrated to recover the blue response of the ultra-thin cells.

Abstract: A simple and low cost thin film solution processing system comprising a single roll coating machine has been developed to allow direct investigation of variable parameter effects in roll-to-roll processing. We present roll coating of the active layers in polymer solar cells and validate the instrument by reinvestigating the well known effect of solvent on performance. We obtained a maximum power conversion efficiency of 1.6% for the reference cells, which compares well with reported roll-to-roll coated cells according to ProcessOne, with a relative deviation caused by solvent type nearing 40% on roll coated cells, confirming the solvent to have a significant influence on the performance of the finished cell. We further present a slot-die coating head with an ultra low dead volume allowing for the preparation of roll coated polymer solar cells on flexible substrates with nearly no loss of solution, enabling roll coating testing of new polymers where only small amounts are often available. We demonstrate the formation of >50 solar cells (each with an active area of 1cm2) with printed metal back electrodes using as little as 0.1mL of active layer solution. This approach outperforms spin coating with respect to temperature control, ink usage, speed and is directly compatible with industrial processing and upscaling.

Abstract: Water is considered as an important degradation factor for PV-modules by causing hydrolysis of polymeric components, corrosion of glass and of metallic components like grids and interconnectors. The type approval testing of PV-modules according to the IEC standards takes water into account by means of the so called Damp-Heat test and the Frost-Thaw test. The test-conditions were designed long time ago and initially meant to reflect the service life of a module, but the type approval testing is not applicable for prediction of long-term durability behaviour, but a qualification test for the assurance of a minimum quality level. Basically absorption and mass transport of water into and within the module has to be considered. These phenomena depend on the ambient climate of the PV-module in use, the design (back-sheet, glass-glass, all polymer, e.g.), the operation conditions (rack-mounted, on rooftop, building integrated) and the material composition. We try to evaluate test conditions that are primarily based on the stresses occurring during the operation at specific locations by using monitored climatic data and applying phenomenological models for the estimation of the moisture load at the surfaces of PV-modules as function of the module temperature. A simple time transformation function was used for the design of appropriate damp-heat tests as accelerated service life tests. The evaluated testing times differ up to an order of magnitude for different climatic locations, depending on the kinetics of the dominant degradation processes.

Abstract: Crystalline tungsten oxide nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) and subsequently employed to form electrochromic thin films using ultrasonic spray deposition. Particle morphology may be tuned using HWCVD synthesis parameters including filament temperature, substrate temperature, and oxygen partial pressure. The electrochromic performance of films derived from three sets of NPs was characterized by performing cyclic voltammetry in direct registry with measurements of optical transmission. The coloration efficiency scaled with the specific surface area, and values obtained from films derived from HWCVD NPs were as high as 38cm2/C, comparing favorably with leading WO3 films produced by sputtering. The HWCVD-based material formed continuous films that were mesoporous in nature, while the larger commercial NPs did not form homogeneous coatings. In addition to size, XRD and Raman analysis revealed a correlation between performance and the presence of the ε-monoclinic crystal phase.

Abstract: We report a relatively simple process for fast nano-texturing of p-type (100) silicon surface using silver catalyzed wet chemical etching in aqueous hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen peroxide solution at room temperature. In this approach, a fine textured black surface was achieved in about 15–30s duration with reflectivity less than 4% in 400–1000nm range. The reflectivity versus texturization time has been investigated and co-related with morphological characteristics of the nano-textured-silicon (nT-Si) surfaces. The nano-texturization process is also applicable in multi-crystalline silicon. Further, n+–p–p+ structured solar cells have been fabricated on such nT-Si substrates following the standard fabrication protocol. Significant improvement in short circuit current density (>20%) and efficiency (∼1.25% absolute) has been achieved compared with planar control cell without deterioration of other performance parameters (such as open circuit voltage and fill factor). Light beam induced current measurements have also been carried out to show the spatial distribution of the light trapping and current in the planar and the nT-Si solar cells.

Abstract: Using probe-type ultrasonic irradiation, the dissolution of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) in photovoltaic (PV) modules was investigated in various organic solvents, including O-dichlorobenzene (O-DCB), trichloroethylene (TCE), benzene, and toluene. The experiments were carried out at different solvent concentrations, temperatures, ultrasonic powers, and irradiation times. In the presence of 450W of ultrasonic radiation, EVA in PV modules was completely dissolved in 3M toluene at 70°C; however, the PV cell was damaged due to the swelling of EVA. At an irradiation power of 900W, the dissolution ratio was greater than that obtained at a power of 450W, and the effects of ultrasonic power were confirmed at 70°C. In TCE and benzene, a decrease in the dissolution of EVA was observed as the temperature increased from 55 to 70°C due to the occurrence of pyrolysis and pyrolytic reactions, which were attributed to the low boiling point and ultrasonic degradation of the solvent, respectively. Except when O-DCB was used, cracks were observed in the PV cell, and the complete dissolution of EVA was attained. Thus, O-DCB is the most effective solvent for recovering PV cells via ultrasonic irradiation.

Abstract: Innovative designs based on semi-interpenetrating polymers networks (semi-IPN), where an electronic conductive polymer (ECP) is formed within – but on each side – a film of a polymer network chosen both for their mechanical properties and ionic conductivity lead to devices with battery-like architecture. Usually, the route to introduce the ECP is an oxidative chemical polymerization leading to conducting semi-IPN with mixed conductivities (electronic and ionic). We will present the fabrication of such semi-IPN using an electrochemical route to form the ECP. This strategy is interesting since it allows the choice of the electrolytic medium and therefore the nature of the doping ion. This process implies the electropolymerization of the conjugated monomer – 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) – within a flexible insulating matrix, which is a Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) network or a flexible IPN made of NBR and a branched polyethylene oxide (PEO) network. In the first part, scanning electron microscopy experiments show that the two-phases composition of the semi-IPN NBR/PEDOT obtained notably the localization of PEDOT inside the NBR matrix. The electropolymerization process is discussed and electrochemical characterization by cyclic voltamograms demonstrates the accessibility of the PEDOT inside the matrix. In the second part, we present first the reflective properties of the NBR/PEDOT semi-IPN. Upon chemical oxidation/reduction processes, it is possible to observe a 25% reflection contrast in the Near Infrared (NIR) at 2.5μm. Then, we described the device's fabrication requiring the dual combination of two semi-IPNs. In order to favor the adhesion between them, we chose a whole system based on an NBR/PEO/PEDOT semi-IPN in which the EDOT is polymerized under the same conditions as previously. The junction was ensured by the PEO partner serving as binder between the two semi-IPNs. Then, after the addition of an electrolyte (LiClO4 0.1M/PC) to complete the device elaboration, it was possible to electrochemically switch the system and to observe NIR optical modulation with a promising contrast up to Δ%R=14% at 2.5μm. The optical properties were also measured in the middle infrared region: the contrasts were Δ%R3–5μm=18% and Δ%R8–12μm=17% in the integrated bands II (3–5μm) and III (8–12μm), respectively.

Abstract: In our previous studies, ZKSCAN3 was demonstrated to be over-expressed in invasive colonic tumor cells and their liver metastases, but minimally expressed in adjacent non-transformed tissues. Further preliminary data showed that ZKSCAN3 was expressed in a majority of prostate cancer patient samples, but not in normal prostate tissues. Moreover, the ZKSCAN3 protein is highly expressed in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, which has high metastatic potential, but little expression was observed in non-metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. Thus, we hypothesized that ZKSCAN3 could participate in tumor metastasis by regulating tumor cell migration. To test this hypothesis, ZKSCAN3 mRNA was knocked down by ZKSCAN3 specific shRNA in PC3 cells and a significant decrease in cell motility was observed. In contrast, when ZKSCAN3 cDNA was overexpressed in PC3 cells, cell detachment was observed and suspension culture induced apoptosis was greatly decreased, suggesting that ZKSCAN3 is able to enhance PC3 cell survival under anoikis stress. Additional wound healing and invasion assays showed that cell migration was enhanced by ZKSCAN3 expression. Interestingly, the ZKSCAN3 gene was amplified in 26% (5/19) of metastatic prostate cancers and 20% (1/5) of lymph node metastases, but there was no amplification found in primary prostate cancers, further supporting the role of ZKSCAN3 in tumor cell migration. In vivo studies using orthotopic tumor models indicated that overexpression of ZKSCAN3 significantly enhanced tumorigenicity. Taken together, we provide evidence that ZKSCAN3, a zinc finger transcription factor, plays a critical role in promoting prostate cancer cell migration.

Abstract: Our laboratory has proved that 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a product of arachidonic acid catalyzed by 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), plays a pivotal role in hypoxic pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, the mechanisms of how hypoxia regulates 15-LO expression are still unclear. As the formation of endogenous transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1), implicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension pathogenesis, was promoted by hypoxia, we suspect whether hypoxia-induced the expression of 15-LO is via the TGF-β1 pathway. We found that treatment of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells with TGF-β1 significantly increased the expression of 15-LO and levels of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, product of 15-LO, which were inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta receptor I (TGFβRI) inhibitor, SD-208 and siRNA targeted to knockdown rat TGFβRI. Moreover, our results showed that TGF-β1 regulated the cell cycle progression and made more cells from the G0/G1 phase to the G2/M+S phase and enhanced the microtubule formation in cell nucleus. Additionally, we found that the 15-LO pathway was involved in TGFβ-1-mediated cell viability, DNA synthesis and the cell cycle progression. Our data provide novel evidence that hypoxia induced 15-LO expression is through TGF-β1, and 15-LO pathway plays a critical role in TGFβRI mediated the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells induced by hypoxia. Thus, new strategies aimed at combined blockade of TGFβRI as well as 15-LO may yield optimal therapeutic benefits.

Abstract: Metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) is a zinc finger protein conserved from mammals to insects. It mediates protection against heavy metal load by activating the expression of metallothionein and other genes. In Drosophila, MTF-1 serves a dual function in that it not only helps to protect against heavy metal load but also induces the expression of Ctr1B, the gene for an intestinal copper importer, upon copper starvation. By dissecting Drosophila MTF-1 function, we have identified determinants for nuclear import and export, and characterized a phosphorylation site mutant (T127A) that differentially affects MTF-1 target genes. Further, by generating a series of fusion proteins with the heterologous DNA binding domain of Gal4 we identified a strong, constitutive activation domain in the central region of MTF-1 (aa 352–540). By contrast, an extended fusion protein that includes MTF-1's C-terminus (aa 352–791) is not active in standard conditions but induced by copper load. The paramount regulatory importance of the C-terminal part, that harbors a cysteine-rich “metallothionein-like” domain, was corroborated by different experiments. Transgenic flies expressing C-terminally truncated MTF-1 variants displayed high constitutive transcription of both, the genes for metallothioneins and the copper importer Ctr1B. The indiscriminate activation of these genes that are normally induced under opposite conditions of copper load and copper starvation manifested itself in a shortened lifespan, crippled wings, and female sterility.

Abstract: The significance of IL-6 production in tuberculosis is yet to be fully elucidated, although it is known for quite some time that IL-6 interferes with IFN-γ induced signal. In order to know which cellular process induced by IFN-γ is actually counteracted by IL-6, we studied the role of IL-6 on IFN-γ induced autophagy formation in virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in THP-1 cells, since it is well characterized that induction of autophagy by IFN-γ eliminates intracellular mycobacterium by overcoming the phagosome maturation block imposed by bacilli. We report here that IL-6 inhibits both IFN-γ and starvation induced autophagy in M. tuberculosis H37Rv infected cells. M. tuberculosis H37Rv infection results in time dependent production of IL-6 in THP-1 cells and neutralization of this endogenous IL-6 by anti-IL-6 antibody significantly enhances the IFN-γ mediated killing of the intracellular bacteria. IL-6 time dependently lowers Atg12–Atg5 complex and therefore inhibits autophagosome biogenesis rather than autophagolysosome formation. IL-6 also affects IFN-γ mediated stimulation of mTOR, p-38 and JNK pathways. These results clearly indicate that virulent mycobacteria strategically upregulate IL-6 production to combat innate immunity.

Abstract: The use of vacuum co-evaporation to produce Cu2ZnSnSe4 photovoltaic devices with 9.15% total-area efficiency is described. These new results suggest that the early success of the atmospheric techniques for kesterite photovoltaics may be related to the ease with which one can control film composition and volatile phases, rather than a fundamental benefit of atmospheric conditions for film properties. The co-evaporation growth recipe is documented, as is the motivation for various features of the recipe. Characteristics of the resulting kesterite films and devices are shown in scanning electron micrographs, including photoluminescence, current-voltage, and quantum efficiency. Current-voltage curves demonstrate low series resistance without the light-dark cross-over seen in many devices in the literature. Band gap indicated by quantum efficiency and photoluminescence is roughly consistent with that expected from first principles calculation.

Abstract: Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which epithelial cells undergo phenotypic transition to mesenchymal cells and thus is involved in the pathogenesis of tumor metastasis and organ fibrosis. Notch signaling is a highly conserved pathway that regulates intercellular communication and directs cell fate decisions. Here, we show the critical role of Notch signaling in TGF-β1-induced EMT. Inhibition of Notch signaling either by γ-secretase inhibitor or by knocking down of Notch signaling molecules by small interfering RNA abrogated EMT in association with decreased expression of Snai1. Constitutive activation of Notch signaling was sufficient for the induction of Snai1 as well as Notch ligand Jagged1. Notch signaling induced Snai1 expression via direct transcriptional activation. Collectively, these data show that Notch signaling activation promote TGF-β1-induced EMT through the induction of Snai1. Further studies on Notch signaling may provide diagnostic and therapeutic targets for cancer and fibrotic disease.

Abstract: As a phase change material, Wood's alloy is infiltrated into the compressed expanded natural graphite (CENG) in an attempt to improve the thermal conductivity of the alloy. The thermal conductivity of the CENG/Wood's alloy composite depends on the bulk density of the CENG. Thermal conductivity of the composites can be 2.8–5.8 times than that of the Wood's alloy. On the other hand, the latent heat of the composites ranges from 29.27 to 34.20J/g. The graphite does not undergo a phase change, so the latent heat would be expected to be linear with the amount of Wood's alloy. The composites have a potential use in the heat sink of the electronic device.

Abstract: A new D-A conjugated polymer containing a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene donor unit and bisthienyl-s-tetrazine acceptor unit, PBDT-TTz, was synthesized by Stille cross-coupling polymerization and was characterized by 1H NMR, elemental analysis and GPC. The copolymer shows good thermal stability with decomposition temperature of 276°C and broad absorption band from 350 to 700nm. Cyclic voltammetric measurement shows that the HOMO energy level of the copolymer is deep-lying (−5.42eV), which implies that the copolymer has good stability in the air and assures a higher open circuit potential when it is applied in photovoltaic cells. Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells were fabricated using PBDT-TTz blended PC71BM as the active layer. The power conversion efficiency of the PSC is 3.32% under 100mW/cm2 AM 1.5 illumination, indicating that PBDT-TTz is a potential candidate for polymer solar cells.

Abstract: Polymer/fullerene solar cells with an inverted layer sequence and free from indium tin oxide (ITO) are presented in this study. We concentrate on critical interface effects in inverted devices and compare different semi-transparent front contacts, such as ultra-thin Au films and Au grid structures. The solvent of the absorber blend was found to have a distinct impact on the stability of the initially deposited cathode layer. Furthermore, we did wettability studies of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) on the active layer and determined the surface energy of polymer/fullerene blends. Ultra-thin Au films with varying thickness were investigated in terms of sheet resistance and transmittance. The optimal thickness was achieved via simulation of organic solar cells. Finally, we present a comparison of inverted solar cells with an active area of about 1cm2 both with Au films and Au grid structures as front contact in terms of photovoltaic performance, reproducibility, and degradation. Notably better results were achieved when using Au grid structures as front contact, even with a not optimized grid geometry.

Abstract: A novel process is developed for the preparation of Prussian blue (PB) film, involving its electrodeposition from its precursor solution, containing additionally the surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB); the film is denoted as CTAB-modified PB film. The present approach allows for mitigating the energy barrier of redox reactions between Prussian blue and its reduced state, Everitt’s salt. The absorbance spectra of the CTAB-modified PB exhibit a maximal optical difference at 690nm. The transmittance changes (ΔT) of CTAB-modified PB film and unmodified PB film were measured in the electrolyte of 0.5M KCl and 0.01M HCl at 690nm. It reveals that CTAB-PB film took 4.2 and 2.4s for darkening (oxidation) and bleaching (reduction), respectively, for 44.2% transmittance change (ΔT), whereas the unmodified film required 35 and 55s for 42.1% of ΔT. By an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) analysis, it is observed that the insertion and extraction of potassium ions and water molecules at the interface of the CTAB-modified PB film and the electrolyte solution are faster than those of the unmodified PB film. Also, during the potential cycling of the CTAB-modified PB film, it was found to be stable, with reference to the stability of the unmodified PB film.

Abstract: Human and rat hepatic tissue express many serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes, such as 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 receptors, which mediate diverse effects. 5-HT is known to regulate several key aspects of liver biology including hepatic blood flow, innervations and wound healing. 5-HT is also known to enhance net glucose uptake during glucose infusion in fasted dogs, but little is known about the ability of 5-HT to control hepatic glucose metabolism, especially glycolysis. This study addresses the potential of 5-HT to regulate PFK activity and the mechanisms related to the enzyme activity. Based on our results, we are the first to provide evidence that 5-HT up-regulates PFK in mouse hepatic tissue. Activation of the enzyme occurs through the 5-HT2A receptor and phospholipase C (PLC), resulting in PFK intracellular redistribution and favoring PFK association to the cytoskeletal f-actin-enriched fractions. Interestingly, 5-HT and insulin act in a synergistic manner, likely because of the ability of insulin to increase fructose-2,6-bisphosphate because the presence of this PFK allosteric regulator enhances the 5-HT effect on the enzyme activity. Together, these data demonstrate the ability of 5-HT to control hepatic glycolysis and present clues about the mechanisms involved in these processes, which may be important in understanding the action of 5-HT during the hepatic wound healing process.

Abstract: A facile approach to develop a novel soluble liquid-crystalline fullerene derivative, N-methyl-2- [(4-(4′-cyano)biphenyloxy)hexyloxyphenyl)]-3,4-fulleropyrrolidine, C60-bp-CN is reported. Compared to C60, the modified C60-bp-CN shows broadened light harvesting and lower LUMO level (−4.2eV), ascribing to the strong intermolecular interaction induced by self-assembled cyanobiphenyl mesogens, especially after thermal annealing from liquid crystalline states. When blended with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), the absorption of the blend film is red-shifted to 700nm, and the intensity is also remarkably increased. The results indicate that the modified C60-bp-CN is a promising acceptor for polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on BHJ active layers. Therefore, solar cell devices based on an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:C60-bp-CN/LiF/Al configuration are fabricated. Clearly, the performances of all the devices are dramatically enhanced relative to corresponding species based on P3HT/C60 active layers. Among all the thermal treatments the mesophase annealing achieves the best performance with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.5mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.52V, a calculated fill factor (FF) of 0.23, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.65%, which is 3 times higher than that of the untreated one.

Abstract: Mounting evidence indicates that signaling via VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) extends beyond blood vessel formation. Recently, VEGFRs are also found to be constitutively expressed in keratinocytes and epidermal appendages. Here, we show that the expression of VEGFRs (including VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and NRP-1) was significantly enhanced by moderate dose of ultraviolet B (UVB) in normal human keratinocytes and epidermis. The elevated expression of VEGFRs by UVB was independent of autocrine stimulation by their natural ligand, VEGF, but mainly mediated through hypoxia and oxidative stress. Moderate dose UVB also promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, this effect was again VEGF independent. Both α and δ isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) were required for UVB-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-1, but only the δ isoform was required for VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of VEGFRs or isoforms of PKC was completely inhibited by PP2, a specific inhibitor for Src family kinases (SFKs), indicating that SFKs are upstream of PKC and VEGFRs. Moderate dose UVB-induced VEGF exerted an anti-apoptotic effect for keratinocytes, whereas high dose UVB-induced VEGF played as an inflammatory factor. Of note, neutralization of VEGFR-2 but not VEGFR-1 exacerbated UVB-induced cell death and reduced survival of keratinocytes. Furthermore, VEGFR-2 neutralization inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 and Akt by UVB, suggesting that VEGFR-2 signaling was involved in the pro-survival mechanism via ERK1/2 and PI3-K/Akt pathway. Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that VEGFR-2 signaling is activated and promotes survival of keratinocytes under moderate dose of UVB irradiation.

Abstract: The photoelectric power conversion efficiencies of currently reported organic/polymeric photovoltaic materials are still relatively low (typically less than 9% under AM 1.5 and one Sun intensity), and the three major losses are still severe, i.e., the ‘photon loss’ due to mismatch of materials energy gaps versus the sunlight photon energies, the ‘exciton loss’ and the ‘carrier loss’ due to poor solid state morphologies of existing polymeric donor/acceptor binary systems. Therefore, both molecular frontier orbitals (HOMOs, LUMOs) and phase morphologies of the photovoltaic polymers need to be optimized to further enhance the efficiency. In this presentation, our recent efforts on frontier orbital and energy gap engineering and terminal functionalizations of conjugated polymer blocks, and the donor-bridge-acceptor type block copolymer approaches will be reviewed. For instance, an earlier developed (DBAB)n block copolymer system (where D represents a conjugated donor block, A represents a conjugated acceptor block, and B represents a non-conjugated bridge unit) exhibited much better photovoltaic properties compared to the corresponding simple D/A blend system. Recently, a new DBA conjugated block copolymer system based on mono-functionalized monomers has also been synthesized. Additionally, a series of terminal functional and sulfone-containing conjugated polymers with evolving frontier orbital energy levels and gaps have recently been designed, synthesized, and studied. The HOMO/LUMO energy gaps of these new polymers were in a range of 1.5–2.6eV, which are very attractive for solar energy applications. The terminal functional groups (aldehyde or phosphonate) make these polymer blocks potentially ideal candidates for the development of donor/acceptor block copolymer supra-molecular nanostructures for a variety of optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: Osteoclasts, bone-specialized multinucleated cells, are responsible for bone destructive diseases such as osteoporosis, periodontitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Natural plant-derived products have received substantial attention given their potential therapeutic and preventive activities against human diseases. In the present study, we investigated the effects of isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a natural flavonoid isolated from licorice, on receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced in vitro osteoclastogenesis and inflammation-mediated bone destruction in vivo. We observed that ISL dose-dependently inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation from RAW 264.7 and primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), as well as decreased the extent of lacunar resorption. Specifically, ISL targeted RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and F-actin rings formation at an early stage. The RANKL-stimulated mRNA expression of osteoclast-related genes and transcription factors were also diminished by ISL. Mechanistically, ISL blocked the RANKL-triggered RANK–TRAF6 association, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), inhibitor of κBα (IκBα) phosphorylation and degradation, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 nuclear translocation, as well as activator protein (AP)-1 activation. ISL almost abrogated the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1) expression and inhibited its nuclear translocation specifically in pre-osteoclasts. Furthermore, the ectopic introduction of NFATc1 into osteoclast precursors almost reversed the ISL-elicited anti-osteoclastogenic effects. Consistent with the in vitro results, administration of ISL prevented inflammatory bone loss in mice by attenuating osteoclast activity. Taken together, our results demonstrated that ISL suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory bone loss via RANK–TRAF6, MAPK, IκBα/NF-κB, and AP-1 signaling pathways. Therefore, ISL may be considered as a novel therapeutic and/or preventive strategy against lytic bone diseases.

Abstract: The quality and lifetime of solar cells critically depend on minimization of both bulk and surface imperfections. When a solar cell is reverse-biased with low voltage, weak emission from imperfections (pre-breakdown sites) appears. We report on the local measurement of such breakdown using a scanning near-field optical microscope. Due to the very weak signals, we use a cooled photomultiplier in the photon counting regime to achieve high sensitivity light detection. This technique allows non-destructive detection, localization and high spatial resolution of light-emitting centers originating from different imperfections in the cell. We have found that the emission from these pre-breakdown sites exhibits unique thermal characteristics. As a consequence, the thermal characteristics can distinguish among several kinds of imperfections in monocrystalline silicon solar cells.

Abstract: The initiation and propagation of a crack in a silicon wafer introduces local variations in the stress field and lattice structure through elastic energy release at crack-tip. In this study, the low load (<10mN) capability of a Hysitron Triboindenter® has been employed to profile the exact distribution of stress and transformed Si-phases around micro-cracks in the PV silicon wafer. Hardness measurements showed an asymptotic drop, as the nanoindents were made closer to radial cracks or indent edges. Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) and micro-Raman spectroscopic measurements, at the nano- and micro-scale, respectively, confirmed that the stress induced amorphization/phase change attributes to the hardness drop. Additionally, microscopic techniques including Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were applied to examine the nanoindent morphology impacted by local stress field and Si-phase change.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) backsheets composed of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films were evaluated via principal component analysis (PCA) of near infrared (NIR) spectral datasets obtained using a potable NIR spectrometer. The discrimination of material and the degree of deterioration of the backsheets following heating and humidifying or irradiating with UV light was examined. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis was also employed to evaluate the degree of deterioration. The reference values (peel and tensile strength) were obtained via the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61215 and Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 1703 standard methods. The values of the peel strength and tensile strength after heating/humidifying treatment correlate quite strongly with the NIR predicted values (R2=0.946 and R2=0.973, respectively). These results show that the degree of deterioration of a PV backsheet can be nondestructively and easily determined via NIR spectroscopy.

Abstract: Sprouty-related EVH1 domain (Spred) proteins modulate growth factor receptor signaling by inhibiting the Ras/ERK pathway. In particular, the Sprouty-related domain (SPR) of Spred2 is essential for the Spred2-mediated inhibitory effect, but the molecular mechanism is largely unknown. We show here that the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a new binding partner of Spred2 via interaction with the SPR domain. Mutation of three tyrosines 303/343/353 within the SPR domain not only abolish EGF-induced p85 binding to Spred2 but also attenuate the inhibitory effect on Ras/ERK activation by Spred2. This results in increased Hela cell proliferation and neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. We further demonstrate that p85 binding to Spred2 enhances the Spred2-mediated inhibitory effect via increased Ras binding to Spred2 and decreased Spred2 ubiquitination. We also show that Spred2 constitutively associates with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via its SPR domain and dissociates from EGFR upon EGF stimulation. Moreover, mutation of tyrosines 303/343/353 together enhances Spred2 binding to EGFR. Taken together, these results suggest critical roles of the three tyrosines 303/343/353 within the SPR domain in regulating Spred2 signaling and provide a mechanism for the SPR domain of Spred2 to mediate the inhibitory effect on the Ras/ERK pathway.

Abstract: We applied complementary imaging methods to investigate processing failures of roll-to-roll solution processed polymer solar modules based on polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunctions. For investigation of processing deficiencies in solar modules we employed dark lock-in thermography (DLIT), electroluminescence (ELI) and photoluminescence/reflection imaging (PLI/RI) complemented by optical imaging (OI). The combination of all high resolution images allowed us to allocate the origin of processing errors to a specific deposition process, i.e. the insufficient coverage of an electrode interlayer. The investigation can be divided into a fast DLIT overview of the module and a successive more detailed analysis of the suspicious region by all imaging methods.

Abstract: We report a new organic photovoltaics (OPV) design, “a wrapped OPV”, which can circumvent both challenges of short exciton diffusion length [1], and low charge carrier mobility [2] of organic semiconductors by orienting the OPV vertically, to capture; manage; guide and use all incident photons and therefore, generate higher current. Resonant light, on being transmitted into a wrapped OPV, makes multiple passes through the photoactive layer and is absorbed completely, thus achieving benefits of thick photoactive layer while maintaining its ultra-thin thickness requirement. The current density generated from a wrapped OPV is twice than that generated by a similar OPV with flat orientation.

Abstract: Grid-connected photovoltaic systems show energy losses due to angular, spectral and low irradiance effects. It would be desirable to know the amount of these losses in real systems. Nowadays, we can find in literature several models, which estimate these losses. However, they are not easy to implement. In this paper, a new method that allows the calculation of angular, spectral and low irradiance losses as a whole is presented. It uses an artificial neural network model in combination with the Osterwald model. Both models are integrated in a single structure. The method is an easy-to-use tool, which only receives two inputs: the global irradiance on the plane of the generator and the cell temperature. At present, the method allows the calculation of the mentioned losses as a whole for systems located at Southern Spain.

Abstract: A high contrast all-solid-state electrochromic device (ECD) is fabricated, using the device heptyl viologen (HV(BF4)2) as the cathodic coloring solution (electrochromic), 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) as the anodic radical provider (ion-storage layer), and crystals of succinonitrile (SN)-plastic as the solid-matrix. The electrochemical and electrochromic properties of HV(BF4)2 and TEMPO molecules are analyzed from their individual perspectives in a 0.1M electrolyte of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4) in propylene carbonate (PC). A solid-matrix is prepared by mixing PC with SN (heated at 70°C) at the volume ratio of 30/70 for PC/SN, and then mixing this content with 0.1M TBABF4. Furthermore, 6wt% silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanoparticles are added to the matrix to eliminate its crystalline nature. This all-solid-state ECD made with this non-crystalline solid-matrix shows a high optical contrast with coloration efficiencies of ca. 65.5 and 342.2cm2/C at 610nm at two stages. The transmittance of the ECD at 610nm can be changed reversibly from 80.7% (bleached) to 6.7% (darkened), with applied potentials of 0 and 1.5V, respectively. Electrochemical and electrochromic properties of the ECD are verified using cyclic voltammetry (CV), in-situ potential-UV–vis absorption 3D spectra, and optical transmittance kinetic curves. ECDs with SN and all-solid-state electrolyte are shown at the stages of bleaching and darkening through their optical microscopic images.

Abstract: Fully roll-to-roll processed polymer solar cell modules were prepared, characterized, and laminated. Cell modules were cut from the roll and matched pairs were selected, one module with exposed cut edges, the other laminated again with the same materials and adhesive sealing fully around the cut edges. The edge sealing rim was 10mm wide. Cell modules were characterized by periodic measurements of IV curves over extended periods in a variety of conditions, as well as by a variety of spatial imaging techniques. Data show significant stability benefits of the edge sealing process. The results of the imaging experiments show that the ingress of atmospheric reactants from the edges leads to degradation. In the case of edge sealed devices the same effects are observed but significantly slowed down. In particular, the fast nonlinear degradation is eliminated.

Abstract: We report a series of fused pyrrolo[3,2-d:4,5-d′]bisthiazole (PBTz)-containing polymers as OPV donor materials, which exhibit a combination of small optical band gap, good solubility and relatively high molecular weight. The performance of the organic photovoltaic cells (OPV) made using the PBTz-containing polymers is studied. The highest performance was obtained with the polymer exhibiting the strongest crystallinity in the blend film, a PBTz-fused bithiophene polymer. Blend devices made from this polymer with PC70BM delivered a short-circuit current density of up to 9.4mAcm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.61V, a fill factor of 53% and a power conversion efficiency of 3%.

Abstract: We investigated the effect of solvent on the photovoltaic performance of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells comprising of an n type polymer poly (2,5-didodecyloxy-1,4-phenylene-2-cyanovinylene-2,5-dioctyloxy-1,4-phenylene-1-cyanovinylene) (DE119) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). We have fabricated devices from blends of P3HT and DE119 with varying acceptor ratio cast from chlorobenzene, toluene and chloroform. For the devices with 1:2wt ratio of P3HT and DE119, respectively, cast from chlorobenzene, we achieved a short circuit current density of (JSC) of 0.85mA/cm2 and an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1100mV with a FF of 0.33 leading to an efficiency of 0.3%. We also showed that inversion of the device can be accomplished using an amorphous titanium oxide (TiOx) as the hole blocking layer.

Abstract: The interlayer adhesion of roll-to-roll processed flexible inverted P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells is reported. Poor adhesion between adjacent layers may result in loss of device performance from delamination driven by the thermomechanical stresses in the device. We demonstrate how a thin-film adhesion technique can be applied to flexible organic solar cells to obtain quantitative adhesion values. For the P3HT:PCBM-based BHJ polymer solar cells, the interface of the BHJ with the conductive polymer layer PEDOT:PSS was found to be the weakest. The adhesion fracture energy varied from 1.6J/m2 to 0.1J/m2 depending on the composition of the P3HT:PCBM layer. Post-deposition annealing time and temperature were shown to increase the adhesion at this interface. Additionally the PEDOT:PSS cells are compared with V2O5 cells whereby adhesive failure marked by high fracture energies was observed.

Non-muscle myosin IIA transports a Golgi glycosyltransferase to the endoplasmic reticulum by binding to its cytoplasmic tail,

Abstract: The mechanism of the Golgi-to-ER transport of Golgi glycosyltransferases is not clear. We utilize a cell line expressing the core 2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-M (C2GnT-M) tagged with c-Myc to explore this mechanism. By immunoprecipitation using anti-c-Myc antibodies coupled with proteomics analysis, we have identified several proteins including non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA), heat shock protein (HSP)-70 and ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 in the immunoprecipitate. Employing yeast-two-hybrid analysis and pulldown experiments, we show that the C-terminal region of the NMIIA heavy chain binds to the 1–6 amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of C2GnT-M. We have found that NMIIA co-localizes with C2GnT-M at the periphery of the Golgi. In addition, inhibition or knockdown of NMIIA prevents the brefeldin A-induced collapse of the Golgi as shown by the inhibition of the migration of both Giantin, a Golgi matrix protein, and C2GnT-M, a Golgi non-matrix protein, to the ER. In contrast, knockdown of HSP70 retains Giantin in the Golgi but moves C2GnT-M to the ER, a process also blocked by inhibition or knockdown of NMIIA. Also, the intracellular distribution of C2GnT-M is not affected by knockdown of β-coatomer protein with or without inhibition of HSPs, suggesting that the Golgi-to-ER trafficking of C2GnT-M does not depend on coat protein complex-I. Further, inhibition of proteasome results in accumulation of ubiquitinated C2GnT-M, suggesting its degradation by proteasome. Therefore, NMIIA and not coat protein complex-I is responsible for transporting the Golgi glycosyltransferase to the ER for proteasomal degradation. The data suggest that NMIIA is involved in the Golgi remodeling.

Abstract: Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain-3 (LC3) plays a critical role in autophagosome formation during autophagy; however, its potential alternative functions remain largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate a discrete role for LC3 in osteoclast, a specialized bone-resorbing cell that requires a dynamic microtubule network for its activity. We found that an increase in the conversion of soluble LC3-I to lipid-bound LC3-II in mature osteoclast was correlated with osteoclast activity, but not with autophagic activity. Knockdown of LC3 using small interfering RNA did not affect TRAP-positive multinucleated cell formation, but suppressed actin ring formation, cathepsin K release, and the subsequent bone-resorbing capacity of osteoclasts. LC3 mediated this function by associating with microtubules and regulating Cdc42 activity. More importantly, LC3-II protein levels were reduced by the Atg5 knockdown, and this knockdown led to decrease in Cdc42 activity, indicating that LC3-II is critical for Cdc42 activity. Overexpression of a constitutively active form of Cdc42 partially rescued the phenotype induced by LC3 knockdown. Our results demonstrate that LC3 contributes to the regulatory link between the microtubule and Cdc42 involved in bone-resorbing activity, providing evidence for a role for LC3 in mediating diverse cellular functions beyond its role as an autophagy protein.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) are a series of functional materials with storing and releasing energy properties. PCMs are able to adjust and control the environment around them through storing and releasing energy during phase change process. Based on the phase change theory, bis(1,3-dihydroxypropan-2-yl)4,4′-methylenebis(4,1-phenylene)dicarbamate, a novel tetrahydroxy compound, was designed and synthesized. Depending on the spatial structure of the tetrahydroxy compound, the form-stable thermoplastic polyurethane solid–solid phase change material (TPUPCM) was prepared. In the molecular structure of TPUPCM, polyethylene glycol was employed as the soft segments, and the hard segments were made up of 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and tetrahydroxy compound made up multi-benzene ring structure. The composition and structure, crystalline morphology, phase change behaviors, thermal performances and mechanical properties for tetrahydroxy compound and TPUPCM were investigated by using fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (1H NMR), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimentry (DSC), thermogravimetry analysis system (TGA) and Instron 5566 tensile tester. The TPUPCM's the weight average molecular weight, number average molecular weight, dissolving and mechanical abilities were also tested. The results show that the solid–solid phase-change material possesses excellent phase-change properties and an applicable temperature range. The heating cycle phase-change enthalpy is 137.4J/g, and the cooling cycle phase-change enthalpy is 127.6J/g. The decomposition of TPUPCM starts and reaches a maximum at 323.5°C and 396.2°C, respectively. Furthermore, the solid–solid phase-change material is dissolvable, meltable and can be processed directly, and has potential applications in thermal energy storage.

Abstract: High-quality surface passivation is essential for obtaining crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells with high energy-conversion efficiency. Silicon-nitride (SiNx)/amorphous-silicon (a-Si) stacked layers prepared by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (Cat-CVD), also referred to as hot-wire CVD, demonstrate excellent performance as surface passivation layers for c-Si and realize a dramatically low surface recombination velocity (SRV). However, the use of a more transparent material than a-Si is required because the a-Si layer absorbs sunlight. Here, Si-rich SiNx films, as a more transparent material, with various atomic ratios of silicon/nitrogen (Si/N) are investigated as a replacement for a-Si films. The use of SiNx/Si-rich-SiNx stacked layers as passivation films on c-Si wafers results in a SRV as low as 5cm/s and 30% improvement of the transparency at the wavelength of 400nm compared to that of the SiNx/a-Si stacked layers. Moreover, after the annealing process, the passivation characteristics of the stacked layer were significantly improved, with a SRV as low as 3cm/s.
