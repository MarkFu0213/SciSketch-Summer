Abstract: Satellite cells play crucial roles in mediating the growth, maintenance, and repair of postnatal skeletal muscle. Activated satellite cells (myoblasts) can divide symmetrically or asymmetrically to generate progenies that self-renewal, proliferate or differentiate. Pax7 is a defining marker of quiescent and activated satellite cells, but not differentiated myoblast. We demonstrate here that deletion of Lkb1 upregulates Pax7 expression in myoblasts and inhibits asymmetric divisions that generate differentiating progenies. Furthermore, we find that Lkb1 activates the Notch signaling pathway, which subsequently increases Pax7 expression and promotes self-renewal and proliferation while inhibiting differentiation. Mechanistic studies reveal that Lkb1 regulates Notch activation through AMPK-mTOR pathway in myoblasts. Together, these results establish a key role of Lkb1 in regulating myoblast division and cell fates choices.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumour with high resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. As such, increasing attention has focused on developing new therapeutic strategies to improve treatment responses. Recently, attention has been shifted to natural compounds that are able to halt tumour development. Among them, carnosol (CAR), a phenolic diterpene present in rosemary, has become a promising molecule that is able to prevent certain types of solid cancer. However, no data are available on the effects of CAR in GBM. Here, CAR activity decreased the proliferation of different human glioblastoma cell lines, particularly cells that express wild type p53. The p53 pathway is involved in the control of apoptosis and is often impaired in GBM. Notably, CAR, through the dissociation of p53 from its endogenous inhibitor MDM2, was able to increase the intracellular p53 levels in GBM cells. Accordingly, functional reactivation of p53 was demonstrated by the stimulation of p53 target genes’ transcription, the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle blockade. Most importantly, CAR produced synergistic effects with temozolomide (TMZ) and reduced the restoration of the tumour cells’ proliferation after drug removal. Thus, for the first time, these data highlighted the potential use of the diterpene in the sensitization of GBM cells to chemotherapy through a direct re-activation of p53 pathway. Furthermore, progress has been made in delineating the biochemical mechanisms underlying the pro-apoptotic effects of this molecule.

Abstract: Thermochromic (TC) vanadium dioxide thin films provide means for controlling solar energy throughput and can be used for energy-saving applications such as smart windows. One of the factors limiting the deployment of VO2 films in TC devices is the growth temperature τs. At present, temperatures in excess of 450°C are required, which clearly can be an impediment especially for temperature-sensitive substrates. Here we address the issue of high τs by synthesizing VO2 thin films from highly ionized fluxes of depositing species generated in high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) discharges. The use of ions facilitates low-temperature film growth because the energy of the depositing species can be readily manipulated by substrate bias. For comparison, films were also synthesized by pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering. Structural and optical characterization of VO2 thin films on ITO-coated glass substrates confirms previous results that HiPIMS allows τs to be reduced from ~500 to ~300°C. Importantly, we demonstrated that HiPIMS permits the composition and TC response of the films to be tuned by altering the energy of the deposition flux via substrate bias. An optimum ion energy of 100eV was identified, which points at a potential for further reduction of τs thereby opening new possibilities for industrially-relevant applications of VO2-based TC thin films. Weak TC activity was observed even at τs≈200°C in HiPIMS-produced films.

Abstract: A chronic excess of glucocorticoids elicits deleterious effects in the hippocampus. Conversely, retinoic acid plays a major role in aging brain plasticity. As synaptic plasticity depends on mechanisms related to cell morphology, we investigated the involvement of retinoic acid and glucocorticoids in the remodelling of the HT22 neurons actin cytoskeleton. Cells exhibited a significantly more elongated shape with retinoic acid and a rounder shape with dexamethasone; retinoic acid reversed the effects of dexamethasone. Actin expression and abundance were unchanged by retinoic acid or dexamethasone but F-actin organization was dramatically modified. Indeed, retinoic acid and dexamethasone increased (70±7% and 176±5%) cortical actin while retinoic acid suppressed the effect of dexamethasone (90±6%). Retinoic acid decreased (−22±9%) and dexamethasone increased (134±16%) actin stress fibres. Retinoic acid also suppressed the effect of dexamethasone (−21±7%). Spectrin is a key protein in the actin network remodelling. Its abundance was decreased by retinoic acid and increased by dexamethasone (−21±11% and 52±10%). However, retinoic acid did not modify the effect of dexamethasone (48±7%). Calpain activity on spectrin was increased by retinoic acid and decreased by dexamethasone (26±14% and −57±5%); retinoic acid mildly but significantly modified the effect of dexamethasone (−44±7%). The calpain inhibitor calpeptin suppressed the effects of retinoic acid and dexamethasone on cell shape and actin stress fibres remodelling but did not modify the effects on cortical actin. Retinoic acid and dexamethasone have a dramatic but mainly opposite effect on actin cytoskeleton remodelling. These effects originate, at least partly, from calpain activity.

Abstract: We have explored the fabrication of indium-free electrodes for use in a PCDTBT:PC70BM organic photovoltaic (OPV) device, and compare different multilayer electrodes as the device anode. Two oxide/metal/oxide structures were investigated that consisted of MoO3/Ag/MoO3 (MAM) and TeO2/Ag/MoO3 (TAM) multilayers. Using scanning electron microscopy measurements, we find that the electrode utilising a TeO2 seed layer encouraged the growth of a more continuous silver layer at low film thickness relative to an MoO3 seed layer, and thus combines enhanced optical transmission (by around 7%) with low sheet resistance (14Ω/□). This enhanced optical transmittance results in an increased short-circuit current in photovoltaic cells, with TAM-based devices having a power conversion efficiency around 6% higher than those fabricated using a comparable MAM electrode.

Abstract: The change in reflectivity of black-Si (b-Si) upon optical excitation was measured by the pump-probe technique using picosecond laser pulses at 532 (pump) and 1064nm (probe) wavelengths. The specular reflection from the random pattern of plasma-etched b-Si nano-needles was dominated by the photo-excited free-carrier contribution to the reflectivity. The kinetics of the reflectivity were found to be consistent with surface structural and chemical analysis, performed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The surface recombination velocity on the b-Si needles was estimated to be ~102cm/s. Metalization of b-Si led to much faster recombination and alteration of reflectivity. The reflectivity spectra of random b-Si surfaces with different needle lengths was modeled by a multi-step refractive index profile in the Drude formalism. The dip in the reflectivity spectra and the sign reversal in the differential reflectivity signal at certain b-Si needle sizes is explained by the model.

The importance of selecting a proper biological milieu for protein corona analysis in vitro: Human plasma versus human serum,

Abstract: Nanoparticle (NP) exposure to biological fluids in the body results in protein binding to the NP surface, which forms a protein coating that is called the “protein corona”. To simplify studies of protein–NP interactions and protein corona formation, NPs are incubated with biological solutions, such as human serum or human plasma, and the effects of this exposure are characterized in vitro. Yet, how NP exposure to these two different biological milieus affects protein corona composition and cell response has not been investigated. Here, we explore the differences between the protein coronas that form when NPs are incubated in human serum versus human plasma. NP characterization indicated that NPs that were exposed to human plasma had higher amounts of proteins bound to their surfaces, and were slightly larger in size than those exposed to human serum. In addition, significant differences in corona composition were also detected with gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, where a higher fraction of coagulation proteins and complement factors were found on the plasma-exposed NPs. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy showed that the uptake of plasma-exposed NPs was higher than that of serum-exposed NPs by RAW 264.7 macrophage immune cells, but not by NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. This difference is likely due to the elevated amounts of opsonins, such as fibrinogen, on the surfaces of the NPs exposed to plasma, but not serum, because these components trigger NP internalization by immune cells. As the human plasma better mimics the composition of the in vivo environment, namely blood, in vitro protein corona studies should employ human plasma, and not human serum, so the biological phenomena that is observed is more similar to that occurring in vivo.

Abstract: The low cost electrodeposition method was used to grow Cu2O thin films and experimentally determine the optimal absorber layer thickness. Raman scattering studies indicate the presence of solely crystalline Cu2O and SEM images show that the thin films consist of grains with a pyramidal shape. The influence of the thickness of the light absorbing Cu2O layer on the basic characteristic of the heterojunction and their properties have been investigated using reflectivity, current–voltage (J–V), capacitance–voltage (C–V) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. The depletion layer, the charge collection length of the minority carrier, and reflectivity are the main factors describing the device properties. The efficiency of 1.09% with an open circuit voltage of Voc=0.35V, a short circuit current density Jsc=6.21mAcm−2 and a filling factor of FF=50% was obtained as the highest value for our solar cells. A Gaussian fit shows that the film thickness of around 3µm is an optimum with respect to a high efficiency of the solar cells. C–V measurements shows that the estimated value of the built-in potential is Vb=0.35V and the acceptor concentration at the junction is NA=4.375×1016cm−3 for solar cell with the highest efficiency.

Abstract: Nb-doped TiO2 (TNO) thin films with high electrical conductivity and excellent transparency were fabricated for the first time by reactive remote-plasma sputtering deposition. TNO films were deposited on non-alkali glass slides at room temperature, using a reactive remote plasma sputtering technology, followed by low-temperature annealing in ambient air. The as-deposited films were amorphous which were then crystallised into anatase nanocrystals after a short thermal exposure of 30min at a moderate temperature of 280°C. Such low temperature crystallisation induced remarkable enhancement of both conductivity and transparency, with the annealed samples demonstrating low resistivity of 6.4×10−4Ωcm at room temperature and up to 87% optical transmittance. Fundamentally, the excellent transparent conductivity from the current work is attributed to the interplay between doping Nb to the Ti sub-lattice sites of the anatase phase and energetic/electronic effects due to formation of native defects. The achieved optical transparency and electrical conductivity for TNO are comparable to those for tin-doped indium oxide (ITO), thus demonstrating great potential in low-carbon processing of TNO to substitute the ITO that is based on the depleting and expensive indium resource.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important for the proliferation of endothelial cells and have been shown to be involved in diabetic retinopathy (DR). In previous study, we found that miRNAs might play a critical role in hyperglycemia-induced endothelial cell proliferation based on miRNA expression profiling. Here, the roles of microRNA-18b (miR-18b) in the proliferation of human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were investigated in an in vitro model of HRECs grown in high glucose. We identified that levels of miR-18b were decreased in high-glucose-induced HRECs, compared with those in cells incubated in normal glucose. However, the reduction of miR-18b up-regulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and promoted effects on in vitro proliferation of HRECs. Mechanistically, insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was identified as a target of miR-18b. IGF-1 simulation could antagonize the effect induced by miR-18b up-regulation, promoting cell proliferation and increasing VEGF production. In contrast, the opposite results were observed with silencing IGF-1, which was consistent with the effects of miR-18b overexpression. MiR-18b exerted its function on VEGF synthesis and cell proliferation by suppressing the IGF-1/insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) pathway, consequently inhibiting the downstream phosphorylation of Akt, MEK, and ERK. Hence, this may provide a new insight into understanding the mechanism of DR pathogenesis, as well as a potential therapeutic target for proliferative DR.

Abstract: Solar blind photodetectors have shown a paramount encouragement owing to their promising applications in the fields of ultraviolet (UV) astronomy, fire alarms, missile warning, environmental studies, biological/chemical analysis and short range communication security. Due to the weak solar blind signal, there is a real need to develop solar blind avalanche photodiode (APD) with high internal avalanche gain to compete with the commercial Si APDs and photomultiplier tubes. Herein, we report the development of APD based on the growth of two wide band gap metal oxides operating within the solar blind region of the UV-spectrum (200–280nm). It was found that the growth of β-Ga2O3 on SnO2 thin film via cation exchange mechanism results in the development of a solar blind photodetector with ultrahigh sensitivity, high spectral selectivity, very fast response, high stability and high signal to noise ratio. The high external quantum efficiency of the APD developed was assigned to the avalanche multiplication effect.

Abstract: Al–N cermet solar selective coatings with double absorbing layers were deposited on Al substrates via a home-made DC magnetron sputter system. The as-deposited coatings showed a high solar absorptance of 0.942 and a normal emittance of 0.066 at 80°C. Thermal accelerated aging tests results showed that the coatings are durable for at least 25 years. Neutral salt spray test showed that the coating presents excellent corrosion stability because the optical performance (absorptance and emittance) of the coating remained almost unchanged after a 200h test. The structural, chemical, and optical evolution of the coatings with heat treatment in air was comprehensively investigated. Our research clearly indicated that the as-deposited double cermet layer Al–AlN solar absorber coatings can be used for solar-thermal flat plate collectors. Furthermore, we obtained different colored Al–AlN cermet coatings in a wide range only by tuning the thickness of the Al–AlN (LMVF) and AlN anti-reflective (AR) layers, while maintaining high absorptance (>0.90) and low emittance (<0.10). These coatings are colored blue, purple, red, yellowish orange, and yellow, can be easily produced via a commercial production process, and are suitable for building integration solar energy saving systems.

Abstract: Conjugates of anthracyclines are a new possibility for anticancer agent delivery, which seems to be a very promising alternative to the currently used cancer treatment strategies. In our study, we investigated the ability of a doxorubicin–transferrin (DOX–TRF) conjugate to induce cell death in two solid tumor cell lines: non-small cell lung cancer (A549) and hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG2). The observed effects of the DOX–TRF conjugate on these cell cultures were compared with those of free doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used antineoplastic therapeutic agent. Our results provided direct evidence that the investigated conjugate is considerably more cytotoxic to the examined human cancer cell lines than is DOX alone. Moreover, we confirmed that the antitumor efficacy of DOX–TRF conjugate is related to its apoptosis-inducing ability, which was shown during measurements of typical features of programmed cell death. In solid tumor cell lines, the DOX–TRF conjugate induced changes in cellular morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential and caspases-3 and -9 activities. Furthermore, all of the analyzed hallmarks of apoptosis were confirmed by the oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation assay and by a real-time PCR quantitative study, which displayed the superiority of the conjugate-induced programmed cell death over free drug-triggered cell death.

Abstract: The performance of crystalline silicon photovoltaic module is mainly determined by the efficiency of silicon cells, but the performances of other components, such as the encapsulant, the front glass and the backsheet, also have an impact. Among these, the optical properties of the backsheet are critical in determining the performance of the photovoltaic module as higher reflectance of the inner side of the backsheet helps redirect more reflected light back to the photovoltaic cell. In addition to the optical properties of the backsheet, the durability of the backsheet should be taken into account due to its role in ensuring a module lifetime of 20–25 years. The backsheet protects the module and its components from external stresses and also acts as an electric insulator. In this study, we focused on the performance and degradation of different types of backsheets and how these impact the performance of the module. We investigate how the initial optical performance of the backsheet impacts the performance of the module. After degradation at 85°C and 85% relative humidity over 4000h, reflectance and module performance were correlated and compared with its initial performance.

Abstract: Emerging evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNA, or miR) play vital roles in regulating osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that govern BMSCs osteogenic differentiation is of paramount importance for improving the treatment of bone-related diseases. In our current study, we investigated the role of miR-23a in BMSCs osteogenesis. Our results revealed that miR-23a was significantly downregulated during osteogenic differentiation. Overexpression of miR-23a inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in vitro, whereas downregulation of miR-23a enhanced the process. Target prediction analysis and dual luciferase reporter assays confirmed that low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) was a direct target of miR-23a. Furthermore, knockdown of LRP5 inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs, similar to the effect observed in upregulation miR-23a. Our data indicate that miR-23a plays an inhibitory role in osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs, which may act by targeting LRP5.

Abstract: Halide perovskite solar cells based on nanocolumnar ZnO are considered alternative candidates to the more established TiO2 based devices. Replacing the scaffold oxide layer by ZnO has the benefit of a larger electron mobility and lower processing temperatures, still reaching power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 15%. The perovskite layer stability and improving the PCE are currently two major issues under investigation. Regarding the latter, the presence of an interfacial layer of Al-doped ZnO (AZO) gives an enhanced power output, as it was recently reported. Using density functional theory calculations we discuss the band alignment at the ZnO (AZO) - halide perovskite interface, indicating one possible source for the enhanced PCE.

These interconnections are typically formed by three patterning steps, each of which have an impact on the series resistance and consequently on the total module performance. Here, we implement the transmission line method for the complete analysis of the P2 patterning step of the photoactive layer in organic photovoltaic modules. Devices are investigated with a sample design that allows for a comparative study of the P2 connection on the solar cell performance. We compare subtractive mechanical scribing to a newly developed additive pre-patterning method for the P2 step. Aerosol Jet printed pre-patterning lines of low surface energy and conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) modified with a fluorosurfactant repel the subsequently spray coated photoactive layer. Furthermore, the influence of MoO3 in the P2 pattern is elucidated, displaying a substantial increase in series resistance and decrease in device performance.

Abstract: The impact of using thin GaAs(Sb)(N) capping layers (CLs) on InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) is investigated for their application in solar cell devices. We demonstrate the ability to combine strain-balancing techniques with band engineering approaches through the application of such CLs. Extended photoresponse is attainable by means of an independent tunability of the electron and hole confinements in the QD. Moreover, the CL acts itself as a quantum well (QW), providing an additional photoresponse, so that the devices work as hybrid QD–QW solar cells. The use of a GaAsSb CL is particularly beneficial, providing devices with efficiencies under AM1.5 conditions 20% higher than standard GaAs-capped QDs. This is mainly due to a significant increase in photocurrent beyond the GaAs bandgap, leading to an enhanced short-circuit current density (Jsc). The addition of N to the CLs, however, produces a strong reduction in Jsc. This is found to be related to carrier collection problems, namely, hindered electron extraction and retrapping in the CLs. Nevertheless, the application of reverse biases induces a release of the trapped carriers assisted by a sequential tunneling mechanism. In the case of GaAsN CLs, this leads to a complete carrier collection and reveals an even higher QD–QW-related photocurrent than when using a GaAsSb CL. The hindered carrier collection is stronger in the case of the quaternary CLs, likely due to the faster recombination rates in the type-I GaAsSbN/GaAs QW structure as compared to the type-II ternary counterparts. Nevertheless, alternative approaches, such as the use of a thinner CL or a short-period superlattice CL, lead to significant improvements, demonstrating a great potential for the quaternary CLs under a proper device design.

Abstract: Accelerated thermal cycle test of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of molecular weight 6000, an organic phase change material (O-PCM), has been carried out for 1500 melt/freeze cycles. The latent heat of fusion and melting temperature is measured using differential scanning calorimeter between 0th and 1500th melt–freeze cycles to study the changes in its thermal properties. Also, the changes in the compositional/functional groups of the material during the cycle test are also measured using FT-IR spectroscopy technique. The melting temperature is found to be stable in the quoted range of 55–60°C with a maximum deviation of 6.5% when compared to that of at 0th cycle. However, a gradual drop in the latent heat of fusion with the increasing number of thermal cycles is measured. The FT-IR spectra do not show any noticeable changes in the peaks which confirm its compositional stability even after the higher number of thermal cycles. Thermal and chemical reliability tests of PEG 6000 along with the techno-economic analysis have shown that this PCM has a significant potential to be used as a thermal energy storage system.

Abstract: We present the preparation and characterization of solution processed lead free films of zero-dimensional methylammonium iodo bismuthate (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 perovskite. Structural characterization reveals the formation of hexagonal micro-crystals with preferred growth orientation along the c-axis. The material exhibits a wide band gap of 2.9eV and upon optical excitation the photoluminescence emission is observed at 1.65eV (751nm). Photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the stoichiometry of the (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 perovskite and yields an ionization energy of 6.24eV, while Raman spectra confirm the vibrational modes of the bioctahedral inorganic anion framework (Bi2I9)3− in the low wavenumber regime (<200cm−1) regime. Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) are employed to evaluate the experimental results. We apply this novel bismuth-based hybrid perovskite in proof of principle simple heterojunction solar cell devices, which yield power conversion efficiencies of ~0.1%. Further enhancement is expected once the film morphology and device stack are optimized.

Abstract: The circulating catecholamines (CAs) epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE) derive from two major sources in the whole organism: the sympathetic nerve endings, which release NE on effector organs, and the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, which are cells that synthesize, store and release Epi (mainly) and NE. All of the Epi in the body and a significant amount of circulating NE derive from the adrenal medulla. The secretion of CAs from adrenal chromaffin cells is regulated in a complex way by a variety of membrane receptors, the vast majority of which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including adrenergic receptors (ARs), which act as “presynaptic autoreceptors” in this regard. There is a plethora of CA-secretagogue signals acting on these receptors but some of them, most notably the α2ARs, inhibit CA secretion. Over the past few years, however, a few new proteins present in chromaffin cells have been uncovered to participate in CA secretion regulation. Most prominent among these are GRK2 and β-arrestin1, which are known to interact with GPCRs regulating receptor signaling and function. The present review will discuss the molecular and signaling mechanisms by which adrenal chromaffin cell-residing GPCRs and their regulatory proteins modulate CA synthesis and secretion. Particular emphasis will be given to the newly discovered roles of GRK2 and β-arrestins in these processes and particular points of focus for future research will be highlighted, as well.

Abstract: This paper reports on modeled and experimental results of industrial aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) silicon solar cells with 3-, 4- and 5-busbar (3-, 4- and 5-BB). It was found that by keeping the same metal grid coverage, solar cells with 4- and 5-BB gave higher fill factor (FF) and energy conversion efficiency than the state-of-the-art 3-BB. This is attributed to decreased gridline resistance as the number of busbars increases from three to four, and four to five. The experimental I–V data showed an average increase in cell efficiency by 0.41%absolute and 0.66%absolute with 4-BB and 5-BB cells, respectively, compared to the 3-BB counterparts. By using the production emitter and commercial size of 239cm2, best efficiency of ~19.94% was achieved for a 5-BB Al-BSF cell.

Abstract: The impact of a low temperature diffusion (LTD) step at about 650°C after emitter diffusion on the performance of silicon solar cells is investigated. Neighbouring wafers from a silicon ingot with and without LTD were chosen to make the cells using screen printed techniques. The efficiency was measured and detailed photoluminescence images were performed for the cells with and without LTD. It is found that LTD can significantly increase the efficiency of the cells about 2% by a gettering effect. The post-firing hydrogen passivation was then applied to the screen printed cells made with and without LTD. The efficiency and photoluminescence image before and after post-firing hydrogen passivation were measured to examine the impact of hydrogenation on the cells made with and without LTD. It is found that cells with LTD can respond better to hydrogenation.

Abstract: Understanding of the durability of each individual layer and their interfaces in a multilayered photovoltaic (PV) backsheet is critical to the design and selection of materials for making reliable and high performance PV modules. In this study, Raman imaging was used to depth profile the chemical degradation of a multilayer commercial backsheet film exposed to ultra-violet (UV) radiation at 85°C, 5% relative humidity (RH, dry) and 85°C, 60% RH (humid) on the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) SPHERE (Simulated Photodegradation via High Energy Radiant Exposure). The backsheet film was a multipart laminate comprising of a pigmented polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-based outer layer, PET core layer and three ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) layers having different vinyl acetate (VA) contents, along with two inner adhesive layers between PET outer and PET core layers, and PET core and EVA layers. Cross-sectional samples were prepared by cryo-microtomy for various characterizations. The multilayer structures were examined by laser scanning confocal and atomic force microscopies, while their chemical degradation profiles were obtained by Raman spectroscopic imaging. Non-uniform degradation was observed in the aged backsheet film, and both UV and moisture appeared to significantly affect the degradation profiles of the multilayers. Severe degradation, indicated by high fluorescence, occurred in the outermost region of the pigmented PET outer layer, and the degradation gradient extended to approximately 20µm to the bulk. It was also found that the inner adhesive layers were severely deteriorated under moist condition, indicating that the long-term adhesion between the layers could be a major area of concern for multilayer backsheets used in a humid environment. The relationship between the sharp (non-uniform) degradation profile, resultant internal stress, and ultimate failures (cracking and delamination) was discussed as well.

Abstract: Noncompensated n–p codoping by different element combinations has proven to be an effective approach to create intermediate bands (IBs) in wide band gap semiconductors. Here, we present a new noncompensated n–p codoping case by simultaneously substitute the cation and anion pair with the same element, which is implemented by using group VA element codoped CuGaS2 systems, within first-principles calculations. The results suggest that the M (N, P, As or Sb) element substitutional codoping on Ga and S sites will introduce partially filled and isolated IBs in the band gap, and that the optical absorption is enhanced in all of the M codoped systems compared with the host CuGaS2, due to the additional electron transition though IB. However, the stability analysis suggest that only P, As and Sb can enable stable IB material growth, and N will decompose the compound into more stable binary phase. Hence, M (P, As or Sb) codoped CuGaS2 materials are predicted as promising candidates in photovoltaic applications. Besides, the codoping method may also be used in other functional materials to obtain controllable doping.

Abstract: Interdigitated nanostructures can increase power conversion efficiency (PCE) by providing large interfaces for the dissociation of excitons and arrays for carrier transportation without recombination. Here, we reappraise the validity of donor–acceptor nanostructures composed of well-aligned porphyrin–fullerene nanopillars based on their contribution to the PCE compared with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) and bilayer (BL) organic photovoltaic solar cells (OPVs) with high efficiencies. Contrary to expectations, the results showed that poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6, 6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) interdigitated nanostructures hardly enhanced the PCE. We suggested three reasons focused on the morphological characteristics: the misbalanced carrier transit time caused by differences in the travel distances and carrier mobilities, detrimental effects on carrier transportation due to the overlap of the pathways to the electrodes, and the dependence of the PCE on the shapes and sizes of the nanostructures.

Abstract: In order to favor electronic conductivity in sodium iron fluorophosphate electrodes for lithium- or sodium-ion batteries, composites of Na2FePO4F with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were prepared by pilot-scale spray drying. Addition of multi-walled CNTs in the solution results in an excellent dispersion of the CNTs within the volume of Na2FePO4F and not only at the surface of the particles. Following a heat treatment at 600°C in argon in order to reach crystallization, X-ray diffraction and ex situ Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed the presence of significant amounts of Fe(III) and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) in the powder. However, Na2FePO4F/CNTs composites exhibit good electrochemical performance when cycling against lithium, with a discharge capacity of 104mAhg−1 at C/10 rate and 90mAhg−1 at 1C rate. Therefore, operando 57Fe transmission Mössbauer spectroscopy analyses were carried out in order to investigate the evolution of the iron oxidation state during cycling. During the first discharge, all the Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II), explaining the good electrochemical performance.

Abstract: The degradation of the open circuit voltage (VOC) and of the I–V characteristics of p+/n amorphous silicon/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells (a-Si:H(p+/i)/c-Si(n) HIT cells) due to the use of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) with small work function at the front contact is investigated. The influence of the TCO work function on the band diagrams, carrier profiles and I–V characteristics in the dark and under illumination is studied by means of AFORS-HET device simulations supported by circuit modeling. It is found that when the TCO work function is not high enough to ensure a good ohmic contact with p-type heavily doped a-Si:H(p+) the VOC degradation is due to the rectifying Schottky barrier at the TCO/a-Si:H(p+) interface. On the other hand, if in addition to the small TCO work function the p-type active doping level in a-Si:H(p+) is reduced, the hole concentration in the p+ inversion layer emitter at the hetero-interface significantly drops leading to a strong enhancement of the emitter dark current and to serious VOC degradation. Moreover, if carrier recombination at the hetero-interface is significant, the weak inversion layer emitter may collapse at a relatively low cell voltage leading to total cell failure.

Modulation of miR-185-5p expression by EBV-miR-BART6 contributes to developmental differences in ABCG4 gene expression in human megakaryocytes,

Abstract: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by low platelet count and bleeding, and is usually triggered by viral infections. We previously reported that 14 viral microRNAs of megakaryocytes cultured with serum from patients with ITP, including ebv-miR-BART6, are up-regulated. Previous research has reported that ebv-miR-BART6 down-regulated the expression of miR-185-5p. We therefore predicted that the ABCG4 gene, which is highly expressed in megakaryocyte progenitor cells, is a direct target of miR-185-5p. We hypothesized that ebv-miR-BART6 may play a role in development and differentiation of megakaryocytes. First, we verified the negative regulation of ABCG4 by miR-185-5p through luciferase assay analysis. Second, after transfection of ebv-miR-BART6 into megakaryocytes developing from normal cord blood mononuclear cells (MNCs), we found that the level of miR-185-5p in the ebv-miR-BART6 group was reduced to almost a third of that in the control groups, accompanied by up-regulation of ABCG4 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Meanwhile, proliferation of megakaryocytes was significantly repressed in the ebv-miR-BART6 group compared with the blank and negative control groups (14.89%±3.13%, 34.15%±2.42% and 30.96%±4.37%, respectively; P<0.001). Our results further revealed that ebv-miR-BART6 inhibited megakaryocyte colony unit formation, decreased CD41 expression and inhibited megakaryocyte polyploidization. These data suggest a new paradigm to explain the mechanisms underlying ITP, involving the regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis by viral microRNAs through the intronic hsa-microRNA.

Abstract: EPAS-1/HIF-2α (Endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1/hypoxia-inducible transcription factors 2α) is a transcription factor expressed in a wide range of human cancers, including stomach cancer. Although EPAS-1 has been studied for years, its function in oncogenic transformation processes needs to be further investigated. In this study, we found that EPAS-1 would promote the growth of stomach cancer cell line BGC-823. Our results revealed that EPAS-1 interacts with Pregnane X Receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that regulates multiple genes’ transcription involved in multi-drugs resistance (MDR) process. Protein-protein interaction between EPAS-1 and PXR was identified by co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pull down assays. By this interaction, EPAS-1 recruited PXR to its response elements in promoter/enhancer regions of CYP3A4, a PXR target gene. Over-expression of EPAS-1 increased the expression of PXR responsive genes, enhanced the proliferation of BGC-823 cells and boosted the resistance of BGC-823 cells against the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs, e.g. Mitomycin C and Paclitaxel. Reduction of EPAS-1 level via its siRNA disrupted the proliferation, and enhanced the susceptibility of BGC-823 cells to those chemotherapeutic drugs. Our findings suggested that EPAS-1 and PXR may cooperatively participate in development and especially MDR process of stomach cancer. These findings may contribute to more effective targeted drugs discovery for the stomach cancer therapy.

Abstract: The proof of concept of using luminescent down shifting (LDS) layers as alternative UV filters for P3HT:PCBM OPVs is demonstrated using a lanthanide-based metal complex. The results are verified using a combination of indoor light soaking, with single cell devices, and outdoor performance monitoring, using a 16-cell monolithically connected OPV module. By applying the LDS layer, a ~5% relative enhancement in photocurrent is observed for both sets of devices. More significantly, indoor light soaking tests on single cell devices without encapsulation showed an 850% enhancement in the measured half-life (T50%). The OPV modules were encapsulated and tested for outdoor stability over a 70 day period in the Negev desert, Israel. The modules made with the LDS filter are shown to match the stability of those made with a commercial UV filter and outperform the modules with no filter applied, with a 51% enhancement in the measured stability (T75%). Significantly, the work provides clear experimental evidence that the LDS layer can act as a UV filter in OPVs without compromising the efficiency of the solar cell, thus providing an added benefit over commercial UV filters.

Abstract: This study addresses the potential-induced degradation (PID) of n-type single-crystalline silicon (sc-Si) photovoltaic (PV) modules with a rear-side emitter. The n-type rear-emitter module configurations were fabricated using n-type bifacial sc-Si solar cells by module lamination with the p+ emitter side down. After the PID tests applying −1000V, the modules show a rapid decrease in the open-circuit voltage (Voc), followed by relatively slower reductions in the fill factor and the short-circuit current density (Jsc). Their dark current density–voltage (J–V) data and external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) indicate that the drop in Voc is caused by an increase in the saturation current density due to the enhanced surface recombination of minority carriers. In contrast, the modules exhibit slight degradation under +1000V, which is characterized by only slight decreases in Voc and Jsc. The EQE measurement reveals that these decreases are also attributed to the enhanced surface recombination of minority carriers. This behavior is almost identical to that of the polarization effect in n-type interdigitated back contact PV modules reported in a previous study. By comparing the PID resistance with that of other types of modules, the n-type rear-emitter PV modules are relatively resistant to PID. This may become an advantage of the n-type rear-emitter PV modules.

Abstract: This research studies a binary mixture composed of sodium nitrate and urea for use as a phase change material in latent thermal energy storage systems between 75 and 90°C. This temperature is suitable for heating and domestic hot water applications, such as solar thermal systems and cogeneration devices. This work is divided into two parts. In Part I, the phase diagram of the system was experimentally determined via DSC, the synthetic visual method and X-ray diffraction. A eutectic composition was found at 71.25% (w/w) urea and 21.75% (w/w) sodium nitrate. The main thermal properties and density of this composition were studied in detail to evaluate its potential as a PCM. The results showed a melting temperature of 85°C and a melting enthalpy of 172J/g. These properties are suitable for the intended purpose. Currently, the mixture presents an approximated market price below 1€/kg, which is highly competitive. In this Part II, the water uptake of the material was evaluated to gain knowledge of its hygroscopic behavior. XRD measurements were also performed to study the formation of new phases or compounds caused by the presence of water. In addition, because urea undergoes thermal degradation upon heating, a preliminary accelerated thermal cycling study was performed to determine the thermal reliability of the mixture. After 210 accelerated thermal cycles, the latent melting enthalpy of the sample was reduced by 1.2%. These results were complemented by chromatographic analysis used to detect any presence of degradation byproducts. According to the results, the mixture formed by sodium nitrate and urea shows potential for use as a PCM in the applicable temperature range. Further research focused on thermal degradation over longer periods of use is encouraged to establish whether the material has a proper lifespan for actual thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that an additional nitrous oxide (N2O) plasma treatment step after the regular SiNx:H anti-reflective coating (ARC) deposition practically eliminates background plating during Ni–Cu contact metallization for c-Si solar cells. This step is relatively simple and could henceforth enable the commercialization of plated Ni–Cu contacts, which is currently inhibited by the creation of localized metal-silicon interfaces due to background plating, among other issues like adhesion. The average active area efficiency and fill-factor of reference cells without any plasma treatment are 17.4% and 73.5%, respectively. N2O plasma treatment before ARC deposition leads to an improved average fill-factor of 75.0%. This improvement is attributed to a reduction in the area affected by background plating by approximately 40% due to the formation of a thin silicon oxy-nitride layer. N2O plasma treatment after ARC deposition is even more effective and can overcome background plating with an average active area cell efficiency and fill-factor of 18.5% and 77.5%, respectively. This performance improvement is attributed to oxidation of the ARC surface by the plasma post-treatment. Analysis of background plating losses is complemented by current–voltage curve fits to a 3-diode model with resistance limited recombination, performed by the freely available program “2/3-Diode Fit”.

Abstract: We have used impedance spectroscopy technique to monitor degradation mechanisms in organic solar cells based on a blend of PTB7:PC71BM. We have measured the impedance of the cell on a periodical basis for almost four months, and experimental data have been modeled using three different circuits. The evolution of the circuital parameters gives information about the device dynamical mechanisms. We have observed at high voltages a low frequency feature that is more pronounced along days of measurement. This low frequency arc has been associated to charge accumulation that is related to a worsening of charge extraction through the contacts. The simultaneous increase of recombination and low frequency resistances at high voltages (around Voc) results in a decrease of the fill factor and therefore of the efficiency.

Abstract: We have determined for the first time the device-relevant optical constants of 500nm and 800nm-thick Cu2ZnSnS4 absorbers, grown on bare and Mo-coated soda-lime glass (SLG), using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The composition, structure, phase purity and morphology were characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning-electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. For the SE analysis, carefully determined sample characteristics were utilized to build a multilayer stack optical model, in order to derive the dielectric functions and refractive indices. The SE-derived absorption coefficients from CZTS/SLG samples were compared with those derived from complementary spectrophotometry measurements and found to be in good agreement. The bandgap determined from Tauc plots was Eg=1.57±0.02eV. The absorption coefficients just above the bandgap were found to be a few 104cm−1 and to exceed 105cm−1 at energies above ~2.5eV, which is much higher than previously found. The sub-bandgap k-value was found to be k~0.05 or less, suggesting that a moderate band tail is present. Separate device characterization performed on identical samples allowed us to assign device efficiencies of, respectively, 2.8% and 5.3% to the 500nm and 800nm-thick samples featured in this study.

Abstract: High conversion efficiency (η) values have been obtained from modified CuS film electrodes electrochemically deposited onto Glass/FTO. The modification involved pre-annealing the film followed by coating with tetra(-4-pyridyl)porphyrinato manganese (MnTPyP+) ions embedded inside a polyethylene (PE) matrix. The Glass/FTO/CuS/MnTPyP/PE electrodes exhibited enhanced photo-electrochemical (PEC) characteristics under solar simulated illumination (5.6mW/cm−2) in aqueous media, compared to the as-prepared Glass/FTO/CuS films which showed no PEC activity. Up to 17.4% efficiency and 85% fill factor (FF) values were obtained from the modified film electrodes. Such characteristics have not been widely known for metal chalcogenide based film electrodes before. Different pre-annealing temperatures were attempted and the 250°C temperature, followed by quenching, showed favorable results. Different aqueous redox couples were studied and the environmentally safe FeCl2/FeCl3 aqueous system showed highest PEC characteristics. Effect of pre-annealing on film electrode characteristics is discussed. The MnTPyP/PE matrix behaves as charge transfer catalyst for the holes across the CuS film/liquid junction.

Abstract: Different synthesis protocols have been developed to control TiO2 anatase nanoparticle packing. The diameter of TiO2 packing aggregate varies from 13nm to a few 100nm. Efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) fabricated with the obtained TiO2 packing aggregate films was reported to depend on the size of the packing aggregate. It increases with the increase of the aggregate size (number of TiO2 nanoparticles) to a maximum of 4.3% and then it decreases. This effect was discussed in terms of a balance between the incident light scatterings, adsorbing amount of dye molecules, cracks free and the efficiency of electron transfer (reduction of recombination process).

Abstract: Diacylglycerol (DAG), a second messenger involved in different cell signaling cascades, activates protein kinase C (PKC) and D (PKD), among other kinases. The present work analyzes the effects resulting from the alteration of DAG levels on neuronal and muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) distribution. We employ CHO-K1/A5 cells, expressing adult muscle-type AChR in a stable manner, and hippocampal neurons, which endogenously express various subtypes of neuronal AChR. CHO-K1/A5 cells treated with dioctanoylglycerol (DOG) for different periods showed augmented AChR cell surface levels at short incubation times (30min–4h) whereas at longer times (18h) the AChR was shifted to intracellular compartments. Similarly, in cultured hippocampal neurons surface AChR levels increased as a result of DOG incubation for 4h. Inhibition of endogenous DAG catabolism produced changes in AChR distribution similar to those induced by DOG treatment. Specific enzyme inhibitors and Western blot assays revealed that DAGs exert their effect on AChR distribution through the modulation of the activity of classical PKC (cPKC), novel PKC (nPKC) and PKD activity.

Abstract: Micropatterned polyaniline (mPani) thin films on indium tin oxide (ITO) conducting substrates are prepared by the electrostatic field-assisted potentiostatic deposition (ESaPD) and their electrochromic (EC) properties are investigated in this study. The mPani thin films can be directly electrodeposited onto the ITO substrates under the influence of a patterned electrostatic field induced by a micropatterned electrostatic film through contact electrification. It is found that the mPani thin film has faster coloring/bleaching responses, small enhancement in transmittance modulation ability and higher coloration efficiency than the non-patterned Pani thin film prepared with the same deposition time. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis indicates that the charge-transfer resistance of the mPani thin film is smaller than that of the non-patterned Pani thin film, and which could be the reason for the enhancement of the EC properties of the mPani thin film.

Abstract: Thirty percent of preterm births directly result from preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (PPROM). Clinical management currently proposes using a collagen plug to mechanically stop loss of amniotic fluid. Vitamin A and its active metabolite (retinoic acid) have well-known pro-healing properties and could thus make good candidates as a proposable adjuvant to this mechanical approach. Here we investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the pro-healing properties of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) in fetal membranes via an approach using an in vitro primary amniocyte wound model and transcriptomics. The results demonstrate that atRA promotes migration in primary amniocytes, improving wound healing in vitro by up to 90%. This effect is mediated by the induction of LOXL4, which plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the extracellular matrix by regulating collagen reticulation. This new insight into how atRA exerts its pro-healing properties prompts us to propose using atRA as a candidate strategy to help prevent future PPROM.

Abstract: Arrays of closely packed nanocrystals show interesting properties that can be exploited to induce new features in nanostructured optoelectronic devices. In this work we study, by first principles calculations, effects induced on near band-edge states and on carrier multiplication by nanocrystals interplay. By considering both hydrogenated and oxygenated structures, we prove that interaction between silicon nanocrystals can alter both the energy gap of the system and dynamics of excited states with a relevance that depends on the nanocrystal–nanocrystal separation, on nanocrystals orientation and on nanocrystals surface properties.

Abstract: The capability to control in an smart way the infrared reflectance to environmental temperature variations can be achieved with thermochromic materials like VO2. In this paper, we report the application of VO2 on ceramic tiles aiming to control the reflected infrared radiation on smart roofs and thus improving the energy efficiency, which is associated to the reduction of the carbon dioxide emissions. The VO2 nanoparticles have been produced by hydrothermal synthesis assisted by microwave irradiation, providing a new, quicker and cleaner production route. Afterwards, the VO2 nanoparticles were transferred to the surface of ceramic glassy tiles, which were prepared through dispersing the nanopowders in water and followed by spray coating with posterior annealing treatments in order to promote the surface adhesion as well as the stabilization of the material monoclinic phase. The VO2 transition temperature was controlled by doping with tungsten and a reduction from 69°C to 49°C was achieved. The superior thermochromic characteristics of VO2 nanoparticles in conjunction with this new application to a smart roof offers a great potential to regulate the energy in an intelligent way.

Abstract: ZnGa2O4:Eu3+ nanophosphor was synthesized through a hydrothermal method and used as an effective light down-shifting/converting material in mesoporous TiO2 layer of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The nanophosphor can convert the high energy incident photon into the photon(s) with lower energy, which can excite CH3NH3PbI3 to generate more photo generated electron–hole pairs, and thus promote the incident light use ratio and increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. After the incorporation of suitable amount of ZnGa2O4:Eu3+ into PSCs, the cell PCE is increased to 13.80% with a photocurrent density of 23.68mAcm−2 and a highest PCE of 14.34% with a photocurrent density of 25.02mAcm−2 is achieved, much higher than those of the cell without ZnGa2O4:Eu3+ (PCE of 10.67% and photocurrent density of 20.2mAcm−2). The enhanced photovoltaic performance by incorporating the nanophosphor into PSCs should be ascribed to the increased incident light use ratio and improved exciton generation rate.

Abstract: Chalcopyrite p-type quaternary CuInxAl1−xSe2 (x=0.44−0.74) semiconductor photoelectrodes are prepared on various substrates via the reactive selenization of radio-frequency-sputtered Cu–In–Al metal precursors. The influence of the aluminum content in the quaternary CuInxAl1−xSe2 photoelectrodes on the structural, optical and photoelectrochemical properties of CuInxAl1−xSe2 samples is investigated. X-ray diffraction patterns and energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays results reveal that the metal precursors can be converted into the tetragonal CuInxAl1−xSe2 phase after the selenizations process under a Se atmosphere at a temperature of 570°C for 1h. The energy band gaps of samples are tuned by varying the aluminum content in samples. The direct energy band gap of samples increases from 1.25 to 1.8eV when the [Al]/[Al+In] molar ratio in samples increases from 0.26 to 0.56. The mobility and carrier density of samples are in the ranges of 1.06–5.86cm2V−1s−1 and 8.23×1016–2.34×1019cm−3, respectively. The sample with an [Al]/[Al+In] molar ratio of 0.34 has the highest photoelectrochemical performance in aqueous H2SO4 solution with the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPCE) and photo-enhanced ABPCE of 8.99% and 3.61% at an applied voltage of −1.0V vs. an Ag/AgCl electrode, respectively.

Abstract: The present work shows the effect of magnesium doping on structural, optoelectrical and electrical properties of Cu2O thin films prepared by spray pyrolysis. The variation in the concentration of Mg shows significant impact on the final thin film properties, whereas the film doped with 0.5at% of Mg exhibited major property improvements in comparison with the undoped thin film and among the other concentrations tested. This condition was further applied for the deposition of an absorber layer in a heterojunction solar cell array with a gradient in thicknesses of active layers to investigate the impact of changing thicknesses on the PV parameters of the solar cell. TiO2 was used as a window layer and the 0.5at% Cu2O doped film as an absorber layer. The produced heterojunction solar cell array was further exposed to a rapid thermal annealing treatment. The I–V measurements show an open circuit voltage of up to 365mV and a short circuit current density, which is dependent on absorber layer thickness, and reaches to a maximum value of 0.9mA/cm2.

Abstract: The impact of device architecture on organic photovoltaic device performance has been problematic to quantify due to extraction layer materials and device testing issues. In particular, published reports have used different pairs of hole and electron extraction layer materials for conventional versus inverted devices. The origins of the large apparent discrepancy in device J–V characteristics become difficult to understand, arising from differences in built-in potentials and in the extraction layers’ conductivities that can affect collection of stray current outside of device area. Here, we show that by using an identical pair of hole and electron extraction layers, and by precisely defining illuminated device area with a shadow mask, most of the differences in the performance of conventional and inverted P3HT:PCBM organic photovoltaic devices are eliminated. The remaining difference in short-circuit current density and EQE spectral shape can be explained primarily by the ratio of hole and electron mobility that leads to more efficient carrier extraction in the inverted devices, with a minor contribution from unintentional p-type doping of the active layer that influences the drift field profile.

Abstract: The corrosion resistance of two ferritic steels P91 and X20CrMoV11-1, two austenitic steels SS316 and SS347H and a Ni-alloy IN625 is studied during long term isothermal immersion in molten nitrate salts consisting of 40% KNO3 and 60% NaNO3. The corrosion test was conducted at 600°C for a maximum immersion time of 5000h. The corrosion behavior was determined by recording the weight changes of samples at different time intervals and metallographic methods. The corrosion products were investigated in detail via electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that P91 and X20CrMoV11-1 do not offer a sufficient long term corrosion resistance in molten nitrate salts. Stainless steels SS316 and SS347H instead formed protective oxide scales in both salts with similar kinetics. However, dissolution of the formed oxide scale in the form of alkali ferrite was observed on stainless steels. A linear weight loss with a very slow kinetics was evident for IN625. However, IN625 showed the best protective behavior among alloys. The qualitative and quantitative EPMA results revealed that a multiphase oxide layer composed of iron–chromium spinel, iron oxides, and sodium ferrite formed on the stainless steel SS347H. A dense NiO layer was primarily formed on the IN625 surface.

Abstract: Aging is accompanied by the functional decline of cells, tissues, and organs, as well as, a striking increase in susceptibility to a wide range of diseases. Within a tissue, both differentiated cells and adult stem cells are susceptible to intrinsic and extrinsic changes while aging. Muscle derived stem cells (MDSCs) are tissue specific stem cells which have been studied well for their multipotential nature. Although there are reports relating to diminished function and regenerative capacity of aged MDSCs as compared to their young counterparts, not much has been reported relating to the concomitant gain in unipotent nature of aged MDSCs. In this study, we report an inverse correlation between aging and expression of adult/mesenchymal stem cell markers and a direct correlation between aging and myogenecity in MDSCs. Aged MDSCs were able to generate a greater number of dystrophin positive myofibres, as compared to, the young MDSCs when transplanted in muscle of dystrophic mice. Our data, therefore, suggests that aging stress adds to the decline in stem cell characteristics with a concomitant increase in unipotency, in terms of, myogenecity of MDSCs. This study, hence, also opens the possibilities of using unipotent aged MDSCs as potential candidates for transplantation in patients with muscular dystrophies.

Abstract: Copper–zinc–tin–sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4 or CZTS) is an important p-type semiconductor material for solar cell applications. A unique architecture for liquid junction solar cell made of ZnO/Al:ZnO/ZnS or ZnSe/CZTS core/shell vertically aligned nanorods array is reported. Over fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass, vertically aligned Al-doped zinc oxide nanorods (VANR) were grown over ZnO seed layer. It was followed by surface transformation of ZnO nanorods to ZnS or ZnSe through solubility constant (Ksp) difference induced anion exchange in a S2− or Se2− solution to produce ZnO/ZnS and ZnO/ZnSe core–shell (CS) structures. Separately, CZTS nanoparticles were synthesized from high temperature arrested precipitation and subsequently used for sensitization of ZnO/ZnS CS-VANR nanostructures. Cu2S and polysulfide were employed as counter-electrode and electrolyte respectively for fabrication of liquid junction solar cells. FE-SEM, HRTEM, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy techniques were employed for microstructural, morphological and compositional characterization of different component materials. The J–V measurements of the solar cell correspond to a several fold higher power conversion efficiency than similar device with thin film multilayer planar configuration involving same amount of materials. The aligned core/shell nanorods configuration offers an increase in the interfacial area by several folds, shorter pathway for charge transport and efficient photon absorption.

Abstract: For understanding and improving the performance of industrial Si solar cells, it helps to quantify the losses in the various device parts very precisely, because this enhances the predictive power of roadmaps deduced from such analysis. We show how the precision of commonly applied methods for measuring the saturation current density, J0, can be noticeably improved. Firstly, two methods are compared for determining the optical properties of the samples specifically made for lifetime measurements. Secondly, it is evaluated, which excess carrier density level is best to choose for extracting J0 of the various device regions. Thirdly, the bulk lifetime is extracted by a combination of measurements and modeling of the surface passivation.

Abstract: Highly transparent and well aligned ZnO nanorods (NRs) have been synthesized by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates. The effect of electrodeposition parameters such as sweep rate and number of cycles was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence (PL) and UV–visible spectroscopy. The deposited ZnO NRs show hexagonal zincite structure and a high transmittance up to 95% in the near infrared and part of the visible region. The density, the orientation and the optical properties of ZnO NRs were strongly affected by the type of the sweep rate, and this was related to the nucleation mode involved in each case.

Abstract: During the last 10 years, the concept of “biased agonism” also called “functional selectivity” swamped the pharmacology of 7 transmembrane receptors and paved the way for developing signaling pathway-selective drugs with increased efficacy and less adverse effects. Initially thought to select the activation of only a subset of the signaling pathways by the reference agonist, bias ligands revealed higher complexity as they have been shown to stabilize variable receptor conformations that associate with distinct signaling events from the reference. Today, one major challenge relies on the in vitro determination of the bias and classification of these ligands, as a prerequisite for future in vivo and clinical translation. In this review, current experimental considerations for the bias evaluation related to choice of the cellular model, of the signaling pathway as well as of the assays are presented and discussed.

Abstract: Planar cell polarity (PCP) is defined as the coordinated alignment of cell polarity across the tissue plane, which is important for the integration of cells into tissues. One of the best examples of PCP is in the cochlear epithelium. Several core PCP proteins have been identified to play important roles in PCP regulation, in which these proteins form complexes and associate with the cell membrane asymmetrically, mediating intercellular PCP signal transduction. Among the core PCP proteins are two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), Celsr and Frizzled, both of which have been shown to play important roles in cochlear PCP regulation. Celsr and Frizzled genes are expressed in the cochlear sensory epithelium, and Frizzled1, 2, 3 and 6 show asymmetric localizations on the cell membrane of hair cells or supporting cells. In the animal model, Celsr1, Frizzled2 and Frizzled3/6 mutant or knockout mice have profound cochlear PCP deficits. Downstream of GPCR signaling, Gαi was shown to asymmetrically localize on the apical surface of hair cells, together with LGN and mInsc, Gαi controls cochlear PCP in a cell-autonomous way. Inactivity of Gαi, LGN or mInsc results in PCP deficits in the mouse cochlea. We hypothesize that GPCR-Gαi coupling plays a pivotal role in cochlear PCP regulation via connecting the intercellular PCP signals with cell-autonomous PCP machinery. Further investigations are needed to fully understand the mechanism of cochlear PCP regulation.

Abstract: In this paper, we report effectiveness of microstructured scattering layer and their efficient light trapping mechanism for performance improvement of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Our simple roll-to-roll processed polymeric scattering layer is an intrinsic and economical way to harvest more light in the photoactive layer of PSC׳s. An inverted polymer solar cell with microstructured scattering layer and photoactive layer of poly[4,8-bis(5-2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl]benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3, 4-b]thioph-ene-(-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)(PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) exhibit a maximum power conversion efficiency of 8.60% under simulated AM 1.5G illumination at light intensity of 100 mw/cm2. A significant improvement of over 15% in short circuit current density of the solar cell devices is achieved by means of suppressing Fresnel reflection at the glass and air interface. In addition, wetting properties and optical simulation of the PSC׳s with and without scattering layer are performed using water contact angle measurement and SETFOS 4.1 module. We expect that this methodology will be advantageous for the development of future organic solar cells.

Abstract: Two electron-donating sides chain (octylthio and methoxy) were strategically attached on BDTT unit to develop two new polymers (PBDTT-OS-TT-EF and PBDTT-OS-TT-CF) as donor materials for polymer solar cells. PBDTT-OS-TT-EF and PBDTT-OS-TT-CF show broad absorption spectra with narrow optical band-gap of 1.52 and 1.56eV, and low-lying HOMO energy level of −5.34 and −5.46eV, respectively. A high Voc of 0.92V was obtained from the PSC devices based on PBDTT-OS-TT-EF. Particularly, the Voc of PSC device based on PBDTT-OS-TT-CF is as high as 1.00V, which is the highest value for the devices based on TT-base polymers. The results indicate that the engineering two electron-donating side chains in BDTT unit is an effective strategy to narrow the band-gap and manipulate the energy levels of polymers, which can be potentially applied to design polymer donor materials with high Voc values.

Twist induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell motility in breast cancer via ITGB1-FAK/ILK signaling axis and its associated downstream network,

Abstract: Twist, a highly conserved basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor, functions as a major regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis. In different cell models, signaling pathways such as TGF-β, MAPK/ERK, WNT, AKT, JAK/STAT, Notch, and P53 have also been shown to play key roles in the EMT process, yet little is known about the signaling pathways regulated by Twist in tumor cells. Using iTRAQ-labeling combined with 2D LC–MS/MS analysis, we identified 194 proteins with significant changes of expression in MCF10A-Twist cells. These proteins reportedly play roles in EMT, cell junction organization, cell adhesion, and cell migration and invasion. ECM–receptor interaction, MAPK, PI3K/AKT, P53 and WNT signaling were found to be aberrantly activated in MCF10A-Twist cells. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis showed that integrin β1 (ITGB1) acts as a core regulator in linking integrin-linked kinase (ILK), Focal-adhesion kinase (FAK), MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and WNT signaling. Increased Twist and ITGB1 are associated with breast tumor progression. Twist transcriptionally regulates ITGB1 expression. Over-expression of ITGB1 or Twist in MCF10A led to EMT, activation of FAK/ILK, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and WNT signaling. Knockdown of Twist or ITGB1 in BT549 and Hs578T cells decreased activity of FAK, ILK, and their downstream signaling, thus specifically impeding EMT and cell invasion. Knocking down ILK or inhibiting FAK, MAPK/ERK, or PI3K/AKT signaling also suppressed Twist-driven EMT and cell invasion. Thus, the Twist-ITGB1-FAK/ILK pathway and their downstream signaling network dictate the Twist-induced EMT process in human mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells.

Abstract: A hybrid tandem solar cell consisting of a thin-film, nanocrystalline silicon top junction and a silicon heterojunction bottom junction is proposed as a supporting solar cell for photoelectrochemical applications. Tunneling recombination junction engineering is shown to be an important consideration in designing this type of solar cell. The best hybrid cell produced has a spectral utilization of 30.6mAcm−2 a JSC of 14mAcm−2, a VOC of 1.1V, a fill factor of 0.67 and thus an efficiency of 10.3%. A high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 7.9% can be predicted when using the hybrid cell in conjunction with current a-SiC photocathode technology.

Abstract: Four β-cyclodextrin/4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate/polyethylene glycol (β-CD/MDI/PEG) crosslinking copolymers with different crosslinking density were prepared and characterized as novel polymeric solid–solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) for thermal energy storage. In the SSPCMs, PEG acts as the phase change functional chain and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) acts as the molecular framework. The results from wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and polarizing optical microscopy (POM) show that the synthesized SSPCMs have good crystallization properties and spherocrystal morphology with smaller size than that of PEG. According to the results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) curves, the SSPCMs possess high phase change enthalpies, good reusability, thermal reliability and stability. It is concluded that the crosslinking density of SSPCMs is a crucial factor significantly influenced the free movement and crystallization of PEG segments, and then affects phase transition properties of SSPCMs.

Abstract: The electronic structures of CdSe/CdTe type II colloidal quantum dots are predicted using a model based on k·p theory and the many-particle configuration interaction method. The separation of energy levels in the conduction band is examined and used to identify phonon bottlenecks, and how these evolve as the shell thickness is increased. Bottlenecks are found to persist both above and below the threshold for multiple exciton generation for all the shell thicknesses investigated. The overall electron cooling rate is thus expected to fall as the shell thickness is increased and Auger cooling suppressed, and this is confirmed experimentally using ultrafast transient absorption measurements. A reduced overall rate of electron cooling will enhance the quantum yield of multiple exciton generation with which it competes. Using a detailed-balance model, we have thus calculated that with proper design of core/and shell structures the efficiency of a solar cell based on CdSe/CdTe quantum dots can be enhanced to 36.5% by multiple exciton generation.

Abstract: High glucose-induced increase in production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) is recognized as a major cause of the clinical complications associated with diabetes. ROS/RNS apart from being redox agents, cause an unwanted severe physiological load to cells, also act as cellular messengers, and play a key role in activation of circulating macrophages. However, the molecular mechanisms of activation of macrophages by hyperglycemic conditions are currently unclear. In the present study, we report that high glucose (HG) causes a dramatic increase in the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, at least in part through enhanced mRNA transcription. The increase in levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines corresponds to increased levels of ROS/RNS, which is accompanied by increased activities of Akt, ERK1/2, tuberin, down regulation of 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase (OGG1), and increase in 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) accumulation in DNA. Elevated levels of ROS/RNS are triggering alteration in antioxidants level, biomolecules damage, cell cycle dysregulation, and apoptosis in macrophage cells. Pretreatment of antioxidants caused decrease in the levels of ROS/RNS leads to an increase in the levels of antioxidants, decrease in biomolecules damage, alterations in Akt, ERK1/2, tuberin, upregulation of OGG1, and decrease in 8-OHdG accumulations in DNA. Further, antioxidants treatments inhibit the effects of HG on the transcriptional activity of cytokines and chemokines. Our results demonstrate that intracellular signaling pathways mediated by ROS/RNS are linked to each other by elevated glucose in macrophages activation leading to inflammation. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation of how ROS/RNS cooperate to conduct inflammatory intracellular signals in macrophages related complications in hyperglycemic conditions.

Abstract: A functionally multilayered Cr/CrTiAlN-G/TiAlN/AlSiN/AlSiO coating configuration, suitable for enhancing solar selectivity of stainless steel substrates used in concentrated solar power (CSP) systems, has been formulated using cathodic arc physical vapor deposition (CAPVD) technique. The sequence of functional layers was decided based on their refractive index values and their relative thickness was optimized to achieve maximum solar selectivity. The optimized coating exhibits encouraging values of solar absorptivity (α) – 0.95 and thermal emissivity (ε) – 0.09 to 0.14 up to 600°C. Further, the solar selectivity factor (α/ε) for the coating is found to be comparable with the best selective coatings currently available for elevated temperature operation. The coatings were also studied for their long term stability and found to be stable up to 500°C, although considerable change in optical properties was observed on increasing the temperature to 600°C. The noted properties make the present coating a promising candidate as a high temperature solar selective coating on stainless steel substrates.

Abstract: The stability of roll-to-roll processed organic photovoltaic modules having an inverted structure and incorporating polyethylenimine–ethoxylate (PEIE) as the electron-selective layer was investigated. Large-area modules were fabricated on ITO-coated PET substrates using roll-to-roll coating and printing methods. Modules were encapsulated with commercially-available ultra-high gas/vapor barrier films by employing new encapsulation protocols developed during this work. The operational lifetime of modules on storage in an environmental chamber at ambient temperature and relative humidity of 35°C and 50%, respectively, and under continuous simulated AM1.5G illumination was found to increase by more than three orders of magnitude upon encapsulation. The chemical stability of the PEIE films under these storage conditions was also studied. Fracture tests were conducted on modules exposed to the same storage conditions to investigate the effects on inter- and intra-layer adhesion and cohesion. An increase in adhesive strength was found for the exposed devices indicating an absence of any substantial mechanical degradation of the deposited layers for the exposure conditions used during this work. The results described here demonstrate the potential utility of commercially-available PEIE as a convenient and effective organic electron-selective layer for the fabrication of durable roll-to-roll processed organic solar cell devices.

Abstract: An advanced photon management approach is developed for a photovoltaic–thermoelectric hybrid system to increase the solar energy utilization efficiency. A biomimetic parabolic-shaped structure on the Si film and a thin SiO2 film at the bottom of the Si film as back-antireflection coating improves the absorptance of photons with wavelengths of 0.3–1.1μm, which can generate electron–hole pairs. Photons with wavelengths of 1.1–2.5μm transmit through the structured surface and are absorbed by the thermoelectric modules, which improves the conversion efficiency of the entire hybrid system. The structured surface with graded refractive index can effectively harvest photons with wavelengths of 0.3–2.5μm. The effects of the structural parameters and the incident angle on the spectral features of the structured surface are analyzed. The results indicate that the structured surface provides high omnidirectional absorptance for wavelengths of 0.3–1.1μm and high transmittance for wavelengths of 1.1–2.5μm as well as favorable polarization-insensitive features over a good incident angle range as a good candidate for the photovoltaic–thermoelectric hybrid systems.

Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) infection triggers autophagosome formation, but inhibits the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. However, the role of autophagy in IAV replication is still largely unclarified. In this study, we aim to reveal the role of autophagy in IAV replication and the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation. By using autophagy-deficient (Atg7−/−) MEFs, we demonstrated that autophagy deficiency significantly reduced the levels of viral proteins, mRNA and genomic RNAs (vRNAs) without affecting viral entry. We further found that autophagy deficiency lead to a transient increase in phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream targets including 4E-BP1 and S6 at a very early stage of IAV infection, and markedly suppressed p70S6K phosphorylation at the late stage of IAV infection. Furthermore, autophagy deficiency resulted in impairment of Hsp90 induction in response to IAV infection. These results indicate that IAV regulates autophagy to benefit the accumulation of viral elements (synthesis of viral proteins and genomic RNA) during IAV replication. This regulation is associated with modulation of Hsp90 induction and mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway. Our results provide important evidence for the role of autophagy in IAV replication and the mechanisms underlying the regulation.

Abstract: Treatment of human erythrocytes with high glucose concentrations altered the content and distributions of three tubulin isotypes, with consequent reduction of erythrocyte deformability and osmotic resistance. In erythrocytes from diabetic subjects (D erythrocytes), (i) tubulin in the membrane-associated fraction (Mem-Tub) was increased and tubulin in the sedimentable fraction (Sed-Tub) was decreased, (ii) deformability was lower than in erythrocytes from normal subjects (N erythrocytes), and (iii) detyrosinated/acetylated tubulin content was higher in the Mem-Tub fraction and tyrosinated/acetylated tubulin content was higher in the Sed-Tub fraction, in comparison with N erythrocytes. Similar properties were observed for human N erythrocytes treated with high glucose concentrations, and for erythrocytes from rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. In N erythrocytes, high-glucose treatment caused translocation of tubulin from the Sed-Tub to Mem-Tub fraction, thereby reducing deformability and inducing acetylation/tyrosination in the Sed-Tub fraction. The increased tubulin acetylation in these cells resulted from inhibition of deacetylase enzymes. Increased tubulin acetylation and translocation of this acetylated tubulin to the Mem-Tub fraction were both correlated with reduced osmotic resistance. Our findings suggest that (i) high glucose concentrations promote tubulin acetylation and translocation of this tubulin to the membrane, and (ii) this tubulin is involved in regulation of erythrocyte deformability and osmotic fragility.

Influence of Sb/N contents during the capping process on the morphology of InAs/GaAs quantum dots,

Abstract: InAs/GaAs QDs are being investigated in the field of solar cells (SCs) with the aim of achieving high SC performances. In order to control the band offsets and the accumulated strain, the application of capping layers (CLs) made of GaAs-based alloys is becoming a common approach that shows promising advantages for SC applications. However, up to now there are very few statistically reliable studies of their impact on the QD morphologies. Our work by TEM techniques over more than a hundred of InAs QDs has evaluated a broad range of CL materials and structures with Sb and/or N with a singular accuracy. Our outcomes showed that the Sb could play antagonistic roles regarding the QD decomposition depending on the growth conditions. Unlike it occurs at common growth rates (1ML/s), at high growth rates of 2ML/s the Sb does not protect the QDs, but even intensifies their erosion. On the other side, N provides the best results in terms of maintaining the original shape of the QDs. In the case of a simultaneous presence of Sb and N, a synergetic effect in the erosion strength is observed. Nevertheless, avoiding the concomitance presence of N and Sb on the growth front by growing a short-period GaAsSb/GaAsN superlattice CLs moderates this behavior. The results are discussed in terms of processes such as surfactant, intermixing, segregation, bond strength or strain-enhanced diffusion that could operate during the capping process. The strong modifications on the QD–CL morphology, that we show are expected to have a significant impact on QD SC performance, cannot be disregarded.

Abstract: Periodontal disease (PD), a degenerative bacterially induced disease of periodontium, can lead to bone resorption and teeth loss. Development of PD includes a strong inflammatory reaction, which involves multiple immune cells and their secreting factors including interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is not only an important modulator of immune and hematopoietic responses but also affects bone metabolism. In the present study we aimed to determine whether IL-17 affects the regenerative potential of periodontal ligament mesenchymal stem cells (PDLSCs) by investigating its ability to modulate osteogenic differentiation of these cells in vitro along with associated signaling pathways. Our results revealed that IL-17 inhibited both the proliferation and migration of PDLSCs and decreased their osteogenic differentiation by activating ERK1,2 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases. Obtained data suggested that IL-17 might contribute to alveolar bone loss in PD.

Abstract: Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis are both characterised by the presence of cytochrome c (cyto-c) in the cytosol. We present data on the extra-mitochondrial NADH oxidation catalysed by exogenous (cytosolic) cyto-c, as a possible answer to the paradox of apoptosis being an energy-dependent program but characterized by the impairment of the respiratory chain. The reduction of molecular oxygen induced by the cytosolic NADH/cyto-c pathway is coupled to the generation of an electrochemical proton gradient available for ATP synthesis. Original findings show that SH reagents inhibit the NADH/cyto-c system with a conformational change mechanism. The mitochondrial integrity-test of sulfite oxidase unequivocally demonstrates that this enzyme (120kDa) can be released outside but exogenous cyto-c (12.5kDa) does not permeate into mitochondria. Valinomycin at 2nM stimulates both the energy-dependent reversible mitochondrial swelling and the NADH/cyto-c oxidation pathway. The pro-apoptotic activity of valinomycin, as well as to the dissipation of membrane potential, can be also ascribed to the increased activity of the NADH/cyto-c oxidation pathway useful as an additional source of energy for apoptosis. It can be speculated that the activation of the NADH/cyto-c system coupled to valinomycin-induced mitochondrial osmotic swelling may represent a strategy to activate apoptosis in confined solid tumours.

Abstract: The malignancy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is largely due to its invasion. Hence, prevention of the cancer cell invasion, which is essentially regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), is substantially critical for a successful treatment for NSCLC. Here, we showed that compared to other cancers, NSCLC had a significant higher ratio of VEGF-A protein vs mRNA, and significantly lower levels of miR-497, suggesting presence of a post-transcriptional control of VEGF-A in NSCLC different from other cancers. Compared with paired normal lung tissue, NSCLC expressed lower levels of miR-497 and higher levels of VEGF-A. Moreover, the levels of miR-497 and VEGF-A were inversely correlated in NSCLC specimen. Bioinformatics analyses showed that miR-497 bound to 3′-UTR of VEGF-A mRNA in NSCLC lines to inhibit its translation. Overexpression of miR-497 in NSCLC lines decreased VEGF-A protein, while depletion of miR-497 in NSCLC lines increased VEGF-A protein. However, modification of miR-497 levels in NSCLC lines did not alter VEGF-A mRNA levels. Overexpression of miR-497 in NSCLC lines inhibited cell growth and invasion, while depletion of miR-497 in NSCLC lines increased cell growth and invasion. Together, our data demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for miR-497 in suppression of VEGF-A-mediated NSCLC cancer cell growth and invasion.

Abstract: Colloidal graphene/PbS quantum dots (QDs) hybrid nanostructures are fabricated with chemical grafting in one-pot solution methods. In the hybrid nanocomposites, PbS QDs are decorated on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets (NSs). By employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, it is shown that the rGO NSs are bonded to PbS nanocrystals through oxygen functional groups, leading to improved surface passivation and electrical conductivity in the hybrids. The results obtained by the recordings of time-resolved photoluminescence spectra, field effect mobility, and photovoltaic performance revealed that rGO grafted to PbS QD composite structures provided better charge transport by 16 times compared to PbS alone, which is attributed to suppressed charge recombination and improved interfacial charge transport processes. Thus, the developed hybrid photoactive film enhanced open circuit current (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) by 12% and 14% correspondingly.

Abstract: Nanostructured thin films are appealing to solar light harvesting and high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. A new Cu2O/ZnO heterojunction solar cell architecture has been developed with ZnO nanotubes (NTs) and nanorods (NRs), on a 500nm thick, n-type ZnO seed layer, covered by a 2.5–3µm thick, p-type Cu2O layer to provide the full built-in potential across the junction area, all done by electrodeposition method. This architecture is used to improve the light harvesting and charge collection efficiency by taking advantage of the high surface area junction and direct charge transfer pathway of these one-dimensional ZnO nanostructures. In addition, we calculate the optimized thickness of p-type Cu2O film of 2.5–3µm to maximize their open-circuit voltages. Post-annealing of the p-type Cu2O nanostructured film at 200°C is found to provide better crystallinity and a higher conductivity for additional improvement in the performance. Further optimization of the Cu2O film thickness according to their charge carrier concentration and absolute permittivity values also assures the full built-in potential across the junction interface. Finally, the electrodeposited tubular ZnO nanostructures are grown on the top of a sufficiently thick ZnO seed layer, which prevents any leakage pathway and increases the junction area, and consequently increases their short-circuit current values. The open-circuit voltages obtained for Cu2O/ZnO-NT (0.66V) and Cu2O/ZnO-NR heterojunction devices (0.71V) represent the highest values reported to date for this type of electrodeposited Cu2O/ZnO solar cells. Interestingly, the short-circuit current density of the Cu2O/ZnO-NT cell (2.40mA/cm2) is twice that of the Cu2O/ZnO-NR cell (1.12mA/cm2) with a photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies of 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. These results illustrate the advantage of single-step electrodeposition of ZnO nanotubes, which provide a larger interfacial area and a much lower defect density than previously reported nanotubes obtained by etching ZnO nanorods. The new device architecture also offers a minimum leakage path and reduced recombination loss expected in typical nanostructure-based photovoltaics. This study demonstrates a promising approach to fabricating low-cost metal oxide nanostructured thin-film solar cells by a scalable, efficient electrochemical method for cost reduction, process simplification, and performance improvement.

Abstract: Objective/background
Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) DNA load is increasingly being used as a noninvasive biomarker for detecting EBV association in lymphomas. Since there is a need of data from India, we undertook to prospectively evaluate plasma EBV DNA load as a marker of EBV association in newly diagnosed adult-onset Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).
Methods
EBV DNA was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. In a subset of patients, an assay was validated qualitatively with EBV latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1) immunohistochemistry (IHC). Wherever possible, follow-up plasma samples post three cycles of chemotherapy were obtained.
Results
Over a period of 10months, 33 newly diagnosed adult-onset HL were enrolled in the study. Pretherapy plasma EBV DNA was detectable in ∼49% (16/33) patients (viral loads range, 1.0–51.2×103copies/mL) and undetectable in 30 voluntary blood donors. LMP1 IHC was positive in 56% of cases tested (14/25). Sensitivity and specificity of plasma EBV DNA with respect to LMP1 IHC were 86% and 100%, respectively. Of the eight patients in whom follow-up plasma was available, in five EBV baseline-positive patients EBV load reverted to negative postchemotherapy and corroborated with clinical remission.
Conclusion
Plasma EBV DNA load estimation may be useful in detecting EBV-association and possibly monitoring the response to therapy in EBV-related HL especially in our country where EBV association of HL is higher than in developed nations.

Abstract: The hot carrier solar cell is a promising concept for high efficiency photovoltaics. Obtaining the dynamic temperature information for the hot carriers in an absorber is of crucial importance to this concept. In this paper, we present a dynamical hot carrier theory that extracts the carrier temperature and the instantaneous carrier occupation from transient absorption spectra. We have applied this model to two transition metal nitride materials, HfN and ZrN. The analysis showed that for HfN the initial carrier temperature rose to 360K immediately after a femtosecond pulse excitation and then dropped rapidly to 330K within 0.13ps. After this initial process, the carrier temperature still remained relatively elevated at above 320K for as long as 2ns. The initial fast process was attributed to the strong carrier–carrier scattering in the material while the slow decay of temperature might be due to unusually weak electron–phonon interactions. A shorter cooling time and overall lower hot carrier temperatures were observed in ZrN.

Abstract: As promising candidates for thermophotovoltaic energy conversion systems, epitaxial thin film III–V cells have gained increasing attention due to their potential for reduced weight. However, few studies have been done to date to enhance the performance of epitaxial single crystal GaSb thin film cells. In this work, the internal quantum efficiencies of epitaxial single crystal GaSb thin film cells with Zn-diffused and epitaxial p–n junctions were predicted with models verified using the corresponding experimental results. The results are the first to indicate that, for the former, when the base region thickness is approximately equal to minority carrier diffusion length, the maximal IQE can be obtained and it is notably higher than the IQE of GaSb bulk cell at wavelengths from 800 to 1700nm. Reducing bottom surface recombination velocity and increasing hole Shockley–Read–Hall lifetime could also increase the IQE. While for the latter, the results demonstrated that the optimal base region thickness is also approximately equal to minority diffusion length, and reducing emitter region thickness will increase the IQE when the base region is optimized. The comparison of the two optimized GaSb thin film cells showed that the GaSb thin film cell with epitaxial p–n junction has a higher IQE.

Abstract: Molybdate hexacyanoferrate (MoOHCF), a brownish red Prussian blue (PB) analogue based on molybdate (MoO), has been prepared as an electrodeposited film for electrochromic window application. The electrochromic mechanism of MoOHCF is similar to that of PB, involving alkali metal ions which intercalate into the lattice structure at different applied potentials to bring a vivid color change. MoOHCF presents a brownish red color at its reduced state (0.51V) and becomes yellowish at the oxidized state (1.17V). Our electrodeposited MoOHCF thin film exhibits wide transmittance change (ΔT=ca. 48%) at 480nm, a fast response time (2.1s) and high cycling stability that exceeds 300 cycles. In addition, it can be assembled into an electrochromic window capable of a broad-band (300–900nm) transmittance modulation with PB. In this study, a PB/MoOHCF electrochromic device (PMECD) with the NaClO4/propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte is fabricated. The device changes its color between deep green and yellowish (almost transparent). By controlling the potential between ˗0.5V and +1.0V (PB vs. MoOHCF), the PMECD shows the capacity of modulating average 40% optical transmittance for whole visible wavelengths. This suggests that MoOHCF is an ideal counter electrode for PB on assembling a promising energy-saving smart window.

Abstract: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide released by motor neuron in skeletal muscle and modulates the neuromuscular transmission by induction of synthesis and insertion of acetylcholine receptor on postsynaptic muscle membrane; however, its role in skeletal muscle protein metabolism remains unclear. We examined the in vitro and in vivo effects of CGRP on protein breakdown and signaling pathways in control skeletal muscles and muscles following denervation (DEN) in rats. In isolated muscles, CGRP (10−10 to 10−6M) reduced basal and DEN-induced activation of overall proteolysis in a concentration-dependent manner. The in vitro anti-proteolytic effect of CGRP was completely abolished by CGRP8-37, a CGRP receptor antagonist. CGRP down-regulated the lysosomal proteolysis, the mRNA levels of LC3b, Gabarapl1 and cathepsin L and the protein content of LC3-II in control and denervated muscles. In parallel, CGRP elevated cAMP levels, stimulated PKA/CREB signaling and increased Foxo1 phosphorylation in both conditions. In denervated muscles and starved C2C12 cells, Rp-8-Br-cAMPs or PKI, two PKA inhibitors, completely abolished the inhibitory effect of CGRP on Foxo1, 3 and 4 and LC3 lipidation. A single injection of CGRP (100μgkg−1) in denervated rats increased the phosphorylation levels of CREB and Akt, inhibited Foxo transcriptional activity, the LC3 lipidation as well as the mRNA levels of LC3b and cathepsin L, two bona fide targets of Foxo. This study shows for the first time that CGRP exerts a direct inhibitory action on autophagic-lysosomal proteolysis in control and denervated skeletal muscle by recruiting cAMP/PKA signaling, effects that are related to inhibition of Foxo activity and LC3 lipidation.

Abstract: Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were prepared on the top of the indium tin oxide (ITO) window layer in thin-film silicon solar cells using a magnetron sputtering method. In comparison with the pure ITO film, the samples with the Au NPs show higher optical transmittance. It is found that the photoluminescence (PL) intensities from the ITO films are enhanced significantly by the Au NPs, so do the macroscopic conductance and the microscopic conductive atomic microcopy (C-AFM) current–voltage (I–V) characteristics. It also appears that the surface work function (φs) is changed by the Au NPs, the longer time the Au NP deposition, the more Au NPs on surface, the larger φs. When the sample is illuminated, its φs downshifts due to the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excited by the illumination on the Au NPs. It is found that the short circuit current density (Jsc) of the solar cells is increased by as much as 20.78% for the optimized solar cell configuration.

Abstract: Here we report photocatalytic application of heterojunction based on In2O3 nanorods decorated black Ti–Ni–O nanotubes. Black Ti–Ni–O nanotubes were fabricated through tin metal reduction reaction with the as-annealed Ti–Ni–O samples. Structural, morphological and optical properties of the heterostructure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra techniques. Nonstoichiometric defects caused by oxygen vacancies in both the In2O3 and the Ti–Ni–O oxides could improve both the visible and infrared absorption, and thus effectively enhance the photocatalytic performance. The heterostructure photoanodes could yield a photocurrent density of 5.32mA/cm2 at 0V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1M KOH and a remarkable photoconversion efficiency of 3.18% at −0.52V vs. Ag/AgCl.

Abstract: Renal fibrosis results from an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix that occurs in most types of chronic kidney disease. Among the many fibrogenic factors that regulate renal fibrotic processes, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and inflammation after injury play critical roles. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is important for signaling processes implicated in autoimmune, inflammatory, and allergic diseases. We examined the effects of Syk inhibition on renal fibrosis in vivo and on TGF-β1-induced renal fibroblast activation in vitro. A unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model was induced in male B6 mice. Mice with UUO were administered a Syk inhibitor or saline intraperitoneally 1 day before UUO surgery and daily thereafter. Both kidneys were harvested 7 days after surgery for further analysis. For the in vitro experiments, NRK-49F rat fibroblasts were pre-incubated with a Syk inhibitor before TGF-β1 stimulation. The inhibitory effects of Syk inhibition on signaling pathways down-stream of TGF-β1 were analyzed. In the UUO mouse model, administration of a Syk inhibitor attenuated extracellular matrix protein deposition and expression of α-smooth muscle actin, type I collagen, and fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, macrophage infiltration in UUO kidney was reduced by Syk inhibition. Pre-incubation of NRK-49F cells with a Syk inhibitor suppressed TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast activation. Furthermore, inhibitory effects of Syk inhibition on TGF-β1-mediated myofibroblast activation were associated with down-regulation of MAPK-p38. These results suggest that Syk inhibition reduces tubulointerstitial fibrosis in UUO mice and inhibits TGF-β1-induced kidney myofibroblast activation. Syk inhibition could have therapeutic potential for the treatment of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

Abstract: Transparent conducting electrodes (TCE) with increased robustness and stability were produced from a composite of silver nanowires (AgNW) and reduced graphene oxide (GO) using ultrasonic spray coating. Ultrasonic spray coating is suited for large area depositions and thin films of AgNW and reduced GO TCEs with consistent optoelectronic properties were produced using this method and the reduction of GO was kept environmentally friendly by using ascorbic acid (AA) as the reducing agent. TCEs produced in this manner were highly conductive and had an average sheet resistance of 5.3Ω/□ and an average transmittance of 64.9% ― the best TCE produced in this manner had a figure of merit of 190. Here, AgNWs were protected from humidity induced degradation and the effect of capillary instability at elevated temperatures on the nanowires was retarded by the introduction of a GO–AA over layer. A τ value of 1.5×10−9 was found to signify the onset of capillary instability induced failure in the AgNW TCE and from experimentally supported calculations, it was predicted that the lifetimes of nanowire TCEs under thermal degradation could be extended significantly by keeping the gaseous environment oxygen free.

Abstract: Cellular senescence is recognized as a potent anticancer mechanism that inhibits carcinogenesis. Cancer cells can also undergo senescence upon chemo- or radiotherapy. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, shows anticancer properties both in vitro and in vivo. Previously, we have shown that treatment with curcumin leads to senescence of human cancer cells. Now we identified the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon. We observed a time-dependent accumulation of mitotic cells upon curcumin treatment. The time-lapse analysis proved that those cells progressed through mitosis for a significantly longer period of time. A fraction of cells managed to divide or undergo mitotic slippage and then enter the next phase of the cell cycle. Cells arrested in mitosis had an improperly formed mitotic spindle and were positive for γH2AX, which shows that they acquired DNA damage during prolonged mitosis. Moreover, the DNA damage response pathway was activated upon curcumin treatment and the components of this pathway remained upregulated while cells were undergoing senescence. Inhibition of the DNA damage response decreased the number of senescent cells. Thus, our studies revealed that the induction of cell senescence upon curcumin treatment resulted from aberrant progression through the cell cycle. Moreover, the DNA damage acquired by cancer cells, due to mitotic disturbances, activates an important molecular mechanism that determines the potential anticancer activity of curcumin.

Abstract: Silicon solar cells featuring carrier selective contacts have been demonstrated to reach ultra-high conversion efficiency. In this work, the electron-selective contact characteristics of ultrathin TiOx films deposited by atomic layer deposition on silicon are investigated via simultaneous consideration of the surface passivation quality and the contact resistivity. Thin TiOx films are demonstrated to provide not only good passivation to silicon surfaces, but also allow a relative low contact resistivity at the TiOx/Si heterojunction. A maximum implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of ~703mV is achieved with the passivation of a 4.5nm TiOx film, and a relatively low contact resistivity of (~0.25Ωcm2 is obtained at the TiOx/n-Si heterojunction simultaneously. N-type silicon solar cell with the champion efficiency of 20.5% is achieved by the implementation of a full-area electron-selective TiOx contacts. A simulated efficiency of up to 23.7% is achieved on the n-type solar cell with a full-area TiOx contact. The efficient, low cost electron-transporting/hole-blocking TiOx layer enables the fabrication of high efficiency silicon solar cells with a simplified process flow.

Abstract: Reverse gravure (RG) coating is reported here as an alternate film deposition method for potential large scale roll-to-roll production of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). The basic working principles of RG coating are shown and compared to the more well-known gravure printing. Gravure printing is similar to RG coating from a process point of view, but the films produced using each method are very different to each other. An optical thickness measurement system was developed and used to monitor film thickness variation of RG coated photo-active layers with various coating parameters in situ in the roll-to-roll process. Partially and fully printed OPV modules were fabricated using, primarily, the roll-to-roll RG coating process and devices showed 2.1% and 1.5% power conversion efficiencies, respectively.

Abstract: We systematically investigated the thermal effects of drying process as well as thermal annealing on morphology and performance of inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) fabricated by roll-to-roll (R2R) slot-die coating. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs layer is strongly influenced by bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer. Compared to the conventional annealing process, we demonstrate that the drying process for transforming the wet active layer into solid-state film (an early polymer crystallization step) in the R2R process is a critical control of morphological evolution to the desired structure. We have demonstrated that a significant improvement in performance of inverted PSCs can be achieved by tuning the parameters in the drying process prior to the annealing process. This study provides the mechanistic understanding of how the drying and annealing processes affect the morphological evolution regarding to the crystallinity, BHJ structure and interface between layers. Moreover, with respect to environmental concerns, halogen-free are carried out as an alternative solvent to halogenated solvents. We successfully incorporate halogen-free solvent, o-xylene, with an elevated drying temperature for improving the performance of R2R slot-die coated inverted solar cells.

Abstract: The objective of this study is to overcome the leakage and low thermal conductivity problems of paraffin as PCMs (phase change materials) for thermal energy storage by impregnating SEBS/paraffin/HDPE FSPCMs (form-stable phase change materials) into metal foam. The form-stable composites were prepared by absorbing paraffin into the network of powder-like styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene (SEBS) triblock copolymer and covering high-density polyethylene (HDPE) on pre-prepared SEBS/paraffin mixture. The composites were characterized by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Hot disk. Paraffin leakage was investigated by accelerated degradation test at 80°C. The melting temperature and latent heat of the composites were determined as 50.56°C and 151.6J/g, respectively. FT-IR results revealed good chemical compatibility among paraffin, SEBS and HDPE. SEM images and XRD test results demonstrated that the paraffin had uniformly dispersed into SEBS. This composite was testified able to keep paraffin from seepage with only 2.39wt% of paraffin loss after 50 thermal cycles test (150h). In addition, the thermal conductivity of SEBS/paraffin/HDPE was 0.272W/mK, which was increased up to 2.142W/mK when copper foam was embedded in the composite.

Abstract: In this report, spinel NiCo2O4 nanobelts anchored on reduced graphene oxide (NiCo2O4@RGO) have been synthesized by a hydrothermal reduction process and used as counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Without RGO, the NiCo2O4 nanobelts tend to aggregate and form sarciniform patterns. By introducing RGO, the NiCo2O4 nanobelts are dispersed on graphene sheets uniformly. The DSSC based on NiCo2O4 nanobelts CE achieves power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.20% and a higher PCE (6.17%) on NiCo2O4@RGO nanocomposite, which was comparable to the Pt CE (6.07%). The cyclic voltammetry tests (CV) analysis indicates that the NiCo2O4@RGO CE gives a more stable catalytic activity for triiodide reduction than NiCo2O4 CE does. Due to the existence of RGO, the composite possesses both higher efficiency and stability.

Abstract: The present work reports on a study on the microstructure and its evolution during processing of CdTe absorber layers from CdTe/CdS thin film solar cells grown by low-temperature processes in substrate configuration. Investigations were performed at different stages of the cell manufacturing, from deposition to the final functional solar cell, with the aim to understand the microstructure formation of the photoactive layer. To this end 3-dimensional microstructure characterization was performed using focused ion beam/electron backscatter diffraction tomography ("3D-EBSD") together with conventional 2D-EBSD. The analyses revealed strong microstructural and textural changes developing across the thickness of the absorber material, between the back contact and the p–n junction interfaces. Based on the 3-dimensional reconstruction of the CdTe thin film, a coherent growth model was proposed, emphasizing the microstructural continuity before and after a typical CdCl2-annealing activation treatment. One of the principal results is that the absorber layer is created by two concomitant processes, deposition and recrystallization, which led to different textures and microstructures. Further changes are the result of subsequent annealing treatments, favoring twinning and promoting well-defined texture components. The results open the possibility for a grain boundary engineering approach applied to the design of such cells.

Abstract: Organo-metal halide perovskite solar cells have shown unique charms in the upgrade rate of maximum power conversion efficiency, the diversity of device architecture and facilitated fabrication process. And the clear understanding of the role of each component and the basic working mechanisms in solar cells is important for further improvement in efficiency, especially for mesoscopic perovskite solar cells. Here, a two-dimensional modeling of the TiO2 nanowire-based organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells was performed combining the optical and electrical responses to reveal the impact of the properties of TiO2 nanowire array and absorber layer. Simulation results show a great dependence of device performance on the electron concentration of TiO2 nanowires, which decided the electron field distribution inside cells, and an optimum thickness of 600nm is obtained for the TiO2 nanowires with low electron concentration. The collection of carriers is primarily within perovskite itself, and the ratio through TiO2 nanowire is less than 5%. These findings can facilitate device optimization and enhance the performance of the perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: The ITO transparent anode with a SnO2 layer (SnO2/ITO) serving as a buffer layer between the PEDOT: PSS has been prepared onto glass substrates. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that the SnO2 layer exhibits an amorphous structure. After the acid treatment, the resistivity of SnO2/ITO anodes was smaller than that of the acid-treated ITO anodes. Furthermore, the mechanism of the enhanced chemical stability by the SnO2 buffer layer is proposed. Such SnO2/ITO transparent anodes were used for organic solar cells (OSCs). The power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of OSCs used SnO2/ITO anodes with a SnO2 buffer layer thickness of 10nm increased by 15% compared with the reference OSC used a bare ITO anode.

Abstract: The use of the upconversion emission in Tm3+ doped glasses for solar applications has been analyzed. The Tm3+ ions, that absorb photons from the near infrared range, perform an energy transfer upconversion process from the 3F4 intermediate energy level to the 3H4 excited state followed by the radiative emission of photons at 800nm, which correspond to the 3H4→3H6 electronic transition. These photons can be absorbed by a silicon solar cell and hence be used in the generation of photocurrent. From the analysis of the rate equations that describes the emission of the 800nm photons, the dependence of the External Quantum Efficiency with the solar concentration value has been obtained.

Abstract: We found a clear correlation between the solar conversion efficiency and the distribution of the ZnS secondary phase in Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) solar cells. Five CZTS solar cells were prepared by the two-step process in which sputtered precursor multilayers were sulfurized at different temperatures. In higher efficiency solar cells, the ZnS secondary phase was found to accumulate near the interface between CZTS and MoS2 formed on top of the Mo layer. It was also found that a solar cell with a higher efficiency showed weaker ZnS Raman signal in the MoS2 layer. The highest conversion efficiency of 7.5% was obtained from a solar cell prepared at a sulfurization temperature of 570°C, in which no ZnS was detected in the MoS2 layer. We suggest that in order to obtain a high efficiency CZTS solar cell, it is critical to find a condition that keeps ZnS from the MoS2 layer.

Abstract: A new, highly photoactive system consisting of N-WO3 coated on polyester fabric is prepared. The catalyst coating is done through a simple heat attachment method. The photocatalytic activity of the photoactive system (N-WO3@PF) is evaluated for degradation of a recalcitrant dye, amaranth, in a recirculation thin-film fixed-bed reactor (TFFBR) under solar light, as well as under ultraviolet A and visible light for comparison. Analyses by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy confirm the presence of N-WO3 evenly coated on the fabric surface. Based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy analysis, N-WO3@PF shows remarkable absorbance in the visible and near-infrared region. The photocatalytic degradation of amaranth under solar light increases with increasing catalyst loading and decreases with increasing flow rate, reactor inclination, and salinity. The inhibition effect of inorganic ions is in the order of Ca2+>CO32−>SO42−>NO3−. At chosen experimental conditions (irradiation time of 4h, dye concentration of 10mg/L, catalyst loading of 16.4g/m2, pH of 7, flow rate of 80mL/min, and inclination angle of 20°), dye degradation efficiencies under solar, ultraviolet A, and visible light are 98.2, 63.5, and 56.7%, respectively. After 12 runs under identical experimental conditions, dye degradation efficiencies are reduced to 86.9 (solar), 56.2 (ultraviolet A), and 41.3% (visible). On the basis of figure-of-merit recommended by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (ACO of 2.9m2/(m3 order)), N-WO3@PF shows a better performance compared to some existing photoactive systems. Overall, results show that the photoactive system N-WO3@PF can be successfully used for the degradation of amaranth in a TFFBR under solar light and could be a suitable option for environmental photocatalysis.

Cubic silicon carbide as a potential photovoltaic material,

Abstract: In this work we present a significant advancement in cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) growth in terms of crystal quality and domain size, and indicate its potential use in photovoltaics. To date, the use of 3C-SiC for photovoltaics has not been considered due to the band gap of 2.3eV being too large for conventional solar cells. Doping of 3C-SiC with boron introduces an energy level of 0.7eV above the valence band. Such energy level may form an intermediate band (IB) in the band gap. This IB concept has been presented in the literature to act as an energy ladder that allows absorption of sub-bandgap photons to generate extra electron–hole pairs and increase the efficiency of a solar cell. The main challenge with this concept is to find a materials system that could realize such efficient photovoltaic behavior. The 3C-SiC bandgap and boron energy level fits nicely into the concept, but has not been explored for an IB behavior. For a long time crystalline 3C-SiC has been challenging to grow due to its metastable nature. The material mainly consists of a large number of small domains if the 3C polytype is maintained. In our work a crystal growth process was realized by a new approach that is a combination of initial nucleation and step-flow growth. In the process, the domains that form initially extend laterally to make larger 3C-SiC domains, thus leading to a pronounced improvement in crystalline quality of 3C-SiC. In order to explore the feasibility of IB in 3C-SiC using boron, we have explored two routes of introducing boron impurities; ion implantation on un-doped samples and epitaxial growth on un-doped samples using pre-doped source material. The results show that 3C-SiC doped with boron is an optically active material, and thus is interesting to be further studied for IB behavior. For the ion implanted samples the crystal quality was maintained even after high implantation doses and subsequent annealing. The same was true for the samples grown with pre-doped source material, even with a high concentration of boron impurities. We present optical emission and absorption properties of as-grown and boron implanted 3C-SiC. The low-temperature photoluminescence spectra indicate the formation of optically active deep boron centers, which may be utilized for achieving an IB behavior at sufficiently high dopant concentrations. We also discuss the potential of boron doped 3C-SiC base material in a broader range of applications, such as in photovoltaics, biomarkers and hydrogen generation by splitting water.

Abstract: Moisture ingress into photovoltaic modules can be detrimental to the expected lifetime of the photovoltaic device. Hence, better understanding of this process and ways to predict the lifetime of a module are of high importance. Moisture ingress occurs through the polymeric materials used in a PV module, especially through the encapsulant which contacts all the sensitive parts in the module. In this work material parameters of polyvinyl butyral, an encapsulant mostly used for glass–glass modules, are presented and an examination of its lateral moisture transport and uptake behavior was undertaken to attain parameters for use in simulations. The uptake of moisture followed Fickian behavior. The absorption isotherm found was of Type III according to the classification by Brunauer, Emmett and Teller.

Abstract: In this work, we describe a novel approach for the fabrication of flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules with an inverted architecture by a versatile and scalable gravure printing process. The printing has been carried out using a sheet-to-sheet (S2S) lab scale proofer, while all the printing steps were performed in ambient conditions and were optimized for each of the OPV layers. Commercially available zinc oxide (ZnO) ink was used as the electron transport (ETL) layer, poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) blend comprised the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layer, poly-3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene:poly(styrenesulfonic-acid) (PEDOT:PSS) was used as the hole transport layer (HTL), and silver (Ag) nanoparticle ink was used as the top contact electrode. The four OPV layers have been successively printed on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible substrate using the same printing parameters, allowing the high production throughput in a roll-to-roll (R2R) printing process. The printed OPV modules have size of 45cm2 with an active area of 8cm2 composed of 8 interconnected cells and exhibited a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.22%. The printing parameters were optimized by the contribution from extensive morphological characterization carried out by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM), as well as from Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE) for the determination of the printed layers thickness, optical properties and photoactive layer blend morphology. The above approach revealed the required printing parameters for the further optimization of the layer interface, morphology, thickness and substrate properties in order to implement the above methodology for large-scale manufacturing of flexible OPVs by a R2R process.

Abstract: In this work, we present the development and assessment of transparent and heat-insulation thin films that represent a new class of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymers. The addition of ultraviolet (UV) absorber, yellow pigment and indium tin oxide (ITO) or antimony tin oxide (ATO) showed significant improvement upon shielding effect against UV light, blue light and near-infrared (NIR) light, respectively. Particularly, environmentally friendly polyester plasticizer was applied. The optical and actual heat insulation properties were investigated by an Ultraviolet–Visible–Near infrared (UV–vis–NIR) spectrometer and a self-designed device, respectively. It was found that low transmittance (21.09% and 24.46% respectively) in NIR region (800–2600nm) can be achieved with the addition of 2.0 phr ITO or ATO particles, and a decrease of 3°C or 5°C can also be observed in temperature test. Meanwhile, the thin films possessed a low UV transmittance performance (200–400nm), accompanied with low transmittance in blue light range (400–500nm) while maintained a high light transmittance in visible light range (400–800nm). The shielding effectiveness provided by the materials fabricated in this study offer specificity and potency in next-generation transparent and heat-insulation thin film, with applications in protection of valuable antique, glasses, display screen and windows of automobiles.

Abstract: A novel process was developed to prepare a sequentially stacked CuGa/In precursor using DC magnetron sputtering to make absorber for Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell. Compared with precursor made of normally used single-layer In, CuGa/In film with bi-layer In was found to be with smoother surface and better coverage of the CuGa film by In islands. CIGS absorber prepared by selenizing the precursor with bi-layer In film showed a surface with less roughness, which indicated strong influence of the surface texture of the precursor on the morphology of the absorber. Furthermore, the thickness inhomogeneity of the In islands on the CuGa layer in the precursor was found to induce different degree of mixing for Ga and In, resulting in a lateral composition fluctuation among CIGS grains in addition to the normally observed vertical Ga grading in each grain. By using a precursor with bi-layer In film, an improvement of cell efficiency is always obtained resulting from the increased open circuit voltage (Voc) and larger fill factor (FF).
