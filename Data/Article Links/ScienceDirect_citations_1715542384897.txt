Abstract: Summary
TIA1 is a prion-related RNA-binding protein whose capacity to form various types of intracellular aggregates has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. However, its role in normal brain function is poorly understood. Here, we show that TIA1 bidirectionally modulates stress-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in fear memory and olfactory discrimination learning. At the behavioral level, conditioned odor avoidance is potentiated by TIA1 deletion, whereas overexpression of TIA1 in the ventral hippocampus inhibits both contextual fear memory and avoidance. However, the latter genetic manipulations have little impact on other hippocampus-dependent tasks. Transcriptional profiling indicates that TIA1 presides over a large network of immune system genes with modulatory roles in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. Our results uncover a physiological and partly sex-dependent function for TIA1 in fear memory and may provide molecular insight into stress-related psychiatric conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful tool by which to characterize the transcriptional profile of low-abundance cell types, but its application to the inner ear has been hampered by the bony labyrinth, tissue sparsity, and difficulty dissociating the ultra-rare cells of the membranous cochlea. Herein, we present a method to isolate individual inner hair cells (IHCs), outer hair cells (OHCs), and Deiters’ cells (DCs) from the murine cochlea at any post-natal time point. We harvested more than 200 murine IHCs, OHCs, and DCs from post-natal days 15 (p15) to 228 (p228) and leveraged both short- and long-read single-cell RNA sequencing to profile transcript abundance and structure. Our results provide insights into the expression profiles of these cells and document an unappreciated complexity in isoform variety in deafness-associated genes. This refined view of transcription in the organ of Corti improves our understanding of the biology of hearing and deafness.

Abstract: Summary
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease treated with anti-CD20-based immuno-chemotherapy (R-CHOP). We identified that low levels of GAPDH predict a poor response to R-CHOP treatment. Importantly, we demonstrated that GAPDHlow lymphomas use OxPhos metabolism and rely on mTORC1 signaling and glutaminolysis. Consistently, disruptors of OxPhos metabolism (phenformin) or glutaminolysis (L-asparaginase) induce cytotoxic responses in GAPDHlow B cells and improve GAPDHlow B cell-lymphoma-bearing mice survival, while they are low or not efficient on GAPDHhigh B cell lymphomas. Ultimately, we selected four GAPDHlow DLBCL patients, who were refractory to all anti-CD20-based therapies, and targeted DLBCL metabolism using L-asparaginase (K), mTOR inhibitor (T), and metformin (M) (called KTM therapy). Three out of the four patients presented a complete response upon one cycle of KTM. These findings establish that the GAPDH expression level predicts DLBCL patients’ response to R-CHOP treatment and their sensitivity to specific metabolic inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
While the pluripotency of stem cells is known to determine the fate of embryonic development, the mechanisms underlying the acquisition and maintenance of full pluripotency largely remain elusive. Here, we show that the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion is critical for the full pluripotency of stem cells. By analyzing induced pluripotent stem cells with differential developmental potential, we found that excess mitochondrial fission is associated with an impaired embryonic developmental potential. We further uncover that the disruption of mitochondrial dynamics impairs the differentiation and embryonic development of pluripotent stem cells; most notably, pluripotent stem cells that display excess mitochondrial fission fail to produce live-born offspring by tetraploid complementation. Mechanistically, excess mitochondrial fission increases cytosolic Ca2+ entry and CaMKII activity, leading to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of β-Catenin protein. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated fundamental role for mitochondrial dynamics in determining the full pluripotency and embryonic developmental potential of pluripotent stem cells.

Abstract: We investigated the protective effects of swimming exercise on high-fat diet-induced heart and aorta damage by evaluating oxidative stress and the endothelial nitric oxide (NO) system. Sprague Dawley rats were fed either standard chow (STD, 6% fat) or high-fat diet (HFD; 45% fat) for 18 weeks, with half of the animals trained by daily swimming sessions (EXC; 1 h per day for 5 days/week) for the last 6 weeks of the experimental period and half kept sedentary (SED). Heart and aorta tissues were prepared for routine light and electron microscopy evaluation. Endothelial NOS (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) distribution in the tissue samples were examined by immunohistochemistry. Biochemical examinations, including blood serum lipid profiles, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and tissue NO levels were measured. Deteriorated heart and aorta morphology, increased MDA levels and iNOS-immunoreactivity (iNOS-ir), as well as decreased GSH, NO, SOD, and eNOS-ir parameters were observed in the HFD + SED group. These morphological and biochemical parameters were ameliorated in the HFD + EXC group. Our study revealed that obesity-induced iNOS activation and increased oxidative stress in cardiac and aorta tissues. Exercise protected the obesity-induced cardiac and aortic tissue damage by modulating oxidant/antioxidant balance via involvement of the NO system.

Abstract: Summary
Insufficient responses to hypocaloric diets have been attributed to hormonal adaptations that override self-control of food intake. We tested this hypothesis by measuring circulating energy-balance hormones and brain functional magnetic resonance imaging reactivity to food cues in 24 overweight/obese participants before, and 1 and 3 months after starting a calorie restriction diet. Increased activity and functional connectivity in prefrontal regions at month 1 correlated with weight loss at months 1 and 3. Weight loss was also correlated with increased plasma ghrelin and decreased leptin, and these changes were associated with food cue reactivity in reward-related brain regions. However, the reduction in leptin did not counteract weight loss; indeed, it was correlated with further weight loss at month 3. Activation in prefrontal regions associated with self-control could contribute to successful weight loss and maintenance. This work supports the role of higher-level cognitive brain function in body-weight regulation in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells induce an immunosuppressive microenvironment that is a major obstacle for successful tumor immunotherapy. Dissecting the regulatory mechanisms between energy metabolism and functionality in Treg cells will provide insight toward developing novel immunotherapies against cancer. Here we report that human naturally occurring and tumor-associated Treg cells exhibit distinct metabolic profiles with selectivity for glucose metabolism compared with effector T cells. Treg-mediated accelerated glucose consumption induces cellular senescence and suppression of responder T cells through cross-talk. TLR8 signaling selectively inhibits glucose uptake and glycolysis in human Treg cells, resulting in reversal of Treg suppression. Importantly, TLR8 signaling-mediated reprogramming of glucose metabolism and function in human Treg cells can enhance anti-tumor immunity in vivo in a melanoma adoptive transfer T cell therapy model. Our studies identify mechanistic links between innate signaling and metabolic regulation of human Treg suppression, which may be used as a strategy to advance tumor immunotherapy.

Abstract: Calcium signalling through store-operated calcium (SOC) entry is of crucial importance for T-cell activation and the adaptive immune response. This entry occurs via the prototypic Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel. STIM1, a key molecular component of this process, is located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is initially activated upon Ca2+ store depletion. This activation signal is transmitted to the plasma membrane via a direct physical interaction that takes place between STIM1 and the highly Ca2+-selective ion channel Orai1. The activation of STIM1 induces an extended cytosolic conformation. This, in turn, exposes the CAD/SOAR domain and leads to the formation of STIM1 oligomers. In this study, we focused on a small helical segment (STIM1 α3, aa 400–403), which is located within the CAD/SOAR domain. We determined this segment’s specific functional role in terms of STIM1 activation and Orai1 gating. The STIM1 α3 domain appears not essential for STIM1 to interact with Orai1. Instead, it represents a key domain that conveys STIM1 interaction into Orai1 channel gating. The results of cysteine crosslinking experiments revealed the close proximity of STIM1 α3 to a region within Orai1, which was located at the cytosolic extension of transmembrane helix 3, forming a STIM1-Orai1 gating interface (SOGI). We suggest that the interplay between STIM1 α3 and Orai1 TM3 allows STIM1 coupling to be transmitted into physiological CRAC channel activation.

Abstract: After injury of the nervous system glial cells react according to the stimuli by modifying their morphology and function. Glia activation was reported in different kainic acid (KA)-induced neurodegeneration models. Here, we describe glial morphometric changes occurring in an excitotoxic KA-induced cervical spinal cord injury model. Concomitant degenerative and apoptotic processes are also reported. Male rats injected at the spinal cord C5 segment either with KA or saline were euthanized at post-injection (PI) days 1, 2, 3 or 7. Anti-IBA-1 and anti-GFAP antibodies were used to identify microglia and activated astrocytes, respectively, and to morphometrically characterized them. Fluoro-Jade B staining and TUNEL reaction were used to determine neuronal and glial degeneration and apoptosis. KA-injected group showed a significant increase in microglia number at the ipsilateral side by PI day 3. Different microglia reactive phenotypes were observed. Reactive microglia was still present by PI day 7. Astrocytes in KA-injected group showed a biphasic increase in number at PI days 1 and 3. Degenerative and apoptotic events were only observed in KA-injected animals, increasing mainly by PI day 1. Understanding the compromise of glia in different neurodegenerative processes may help to define possible common or specific therapeutic approaches directed towards neurorestorative strategies.

Abstract: Summary
The genome is organized into topologically associated domains (TADs) that enclose smaller subTADs. Here, we identify and characterize an enhancer that is located in the middle of the V gene region of the immunoglobulin kappa light chain (Igκ) locus that becomes active preceding the stage at which this locus undergoes V(D)J recombination. This enhancer is a hub of long-range chromatin interactions connecting subTADs in the V gene region with the recombination center at the J genes. Deletion of this element results in a highly altered long-range chromatin interaction pattern across the locus and, importantly, affects individual V gene utilization locus-wide. These results indicate the existence of an enhancer-dependent framework in the Igκ locus and further suggest that the composition of the diverse antibody repertoire is regulated in a subTAD-specific manner. This enhancer thus plays a structural role in orchestrating the proper folding of the Igκ locus in preparation for V(D)J recombination.

Abstract: Summary
Both the timing and kinetics of neurotransmitter release depend on the positioning of clustered Ca2+ channels in active zones to docked synaptic vesicles on presynaptic plasma membranes. However, how active zones form is not known. Here, we show that RIM and RIM-BP, via specific multivalent bindings, form dynamic and condensed assemblies through liquid-liquid phase separation. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs), via C-terminal-tail-mediated direct binding to both RIM and RIM-BP, can be enriched to the RIM and RIM-BP condensates. We further show that RIM and RIM-BP, together with VGCCs, form dense clusters on the supported lipid membrane bilayers via phase separation. Therefore, RIMs and RIM-BPs are plausible organizers of active zones, and the formation of RIM and RIM-BP condensates may cluster VGCCs into nano- or microdomains and position the clustered Ca2+ channels with Ca2+ sensors on docked vesicles for efficient and precise synaptic transmissions.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) is an abundant and essential component of the translation machinery. The biogenesis of this 93 kDa multi-domain protein is assisted by the chaperonin TRiC/CCT. Here, we show in yeast cells that the highly conserved protein Hgh1 (FAM203 in humans) is a chaperone that cooperates with TRiC in eEF2 folding. In the absence of Hgh1, a substantial fraction of newly synthesized eEF2 is degraded or aggregates. We solved the crystal structure of Hgh1 and analyzed the interaction of wild-type and mutant Hgh1 with eEF2. These experiments revealed that Hgh1 is an armadillo repeat protein that binds to the dynamic central domain III of eEF2 via a bipartite interface. Hgh1 binding recruits TRiC to the C-terminal eEF2 module and prevents unproductive interactions of domain III, allowing efficient folding of the N-terminal GTPase module. eEF2 folding is completed upon dissociation of TRiC and Hgh1.

Abstract: Summary
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is implicated in value-based decision making, anticipation, and adaptation; however, how ACC activity modulates these behaviors is unclear. One possibility is via the ACC’s connections with the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a dopaminergic region implicated in motivation and feedback processing. We tested this by monitoring ACC and VTA local field potentials in rats performing a cost-benefit reversal task that elicited both value-based and anticipatory choices. Partial directed coherence analyses revealed that elevated 4-Hz ACC-to-VTA signaling accompanied decisions that appeared to be anticipatory. ACC-to-VTA signaling also occurred post-reversal, consistent with it being involved in the initiation of non-default behavior. An analysis of 4-Hz signals in the other direction (VTA-to-ACC) revealed that it was elevated when the rats committed errors and that this signal was followed by behavioral adaptation. Together, these findings suggest that bidirectional communication between the ACC and VTA supports behavioral flexibility.

Abstract: The porcine myeloid antimicrobial peptide (PMAP), one of the cathelicidin family members, contains small cationic peptides with amphipathic properties. We used a putative lysozyme originated from the bacteriophage P22 (P22 lysozyme) as a fusion partner, which was connected to the N-terminus of the PMAP36 peptide, to markedly increase the expression levels of recombinant PMAP36. The PMAP36-P22 lysozyme fusion protein with high solubility was produced in Escherichia coli. The final purified yield was approximately 1.8 mg/L. The purified PMAP36-P22 lysozyme fusion protein exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus subtilis). Furthermore, we estimated its hemolytic activity against pig erythrocytes as 6% at the high concentration (128 μM) of the PMAP36-P22 lysozyme fusion protein. Compared with the PMAP36 peptide (12%), our fusion protein exhibited half of the hemolytic activity. Overall, our recombinant PMAP36-P22 lysozyme fusion protein sustained the antimicrobial activity with the lower hemolytic activity associated with the synthetic PMAP36 peptide. This study suggests that the PMAP36-P22 lysozyme fusion system could be a crucial addition to the plethora of novel antimicrobials.

Abstract: Summary
The reactions catalyzed by the delta-5 and delta-6 desaturases (D5D/D6D), key enzymes responsible for highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) synthesis, regenerate NAD+ from NADH. Here, we show that D5D/D6D provide a mechanism for glycolytic NAD+ recycling that permits ongoing glycolysis and cell viability when the cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio is reduced, analogous to lactate fermentation. Although lesser in magnitude than lactate production, this desaturase-mediated NAD+ recycling is acutely adaptive when aerobic respiration is impaired in vivo. Notably, inhibition of either HUFA synthesis or lactate fermentation increases the other, underscoring their interdependence. Consistent with this, a type 2 diabetes risk haplotype in SLC16A11 that reduces pyruvate transport (thus limiting lactate production) increases D5D/D6D activity in vitro and in humans, demonstrating a chronic effect of desaturase-mediated NAD+ recycling. These findings highlight key biologic roles for D5D/D6D activity independent of their HUFA end products and expand the current paradigm of glycolytic NAD+ regeneration.

Abstract: Purpose
It has been suggested that FK506 could improve some symptoms of OAB in both clinical settings and animal models; however, its mechanism of action is not well-understood. Here, we investigated the effect of FK506 on TRPC6 in bladder smooth muscle, and explored the possible involvement of TRPC6 in OAB.
Methods
FK506 was injected intraperitoneally into rats in which OAB was induced via BOO, and urodynamic indices were recorded. Rats and human bladder smooth muscle tissues with or without OAB were examined for TRPC6 expression by western blot, RT-PCR and IF staining. Cultured BSMCs were treated with PDGF, TRPC6 siRNAs and FK506. Then the TRPC6 expression and cellular proliferation were examined, and the Ca2+ influx and contractility of BSMCs were examined by time-lapse Ca2+ imaging and collagen gel contraction. Finally, IF and Co-IP were performed to test the effects of FK506 on NFAT translocation to the nucleus and the interaction of TRPC6 with FKBP12, respectively.
Results
FK506 improved urodynamic indices of OAB rats, and TRPC6 was expressed in rats and human bladder tissues. TRPC6 elevation in OAB rats was inhibited by FK506, and this inhibition coincided with improvements in urodynamic indices. PDGF enhanced TRPC6 expression, cellular proliferation, Ca2+ influx and contractility of BSMCs, and these effects were inhibited by TRPC6 siRNAs and FK506. FK506 inhibited NFAT translocation to the nucleus and disrupted the interaction of TRPC6 with FKBP12.
Conclusions
Our results collectively indicate that FK506 may be used to treat OAB, and that TRPC6 may serve as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in OAB.

Phosphorylation of heptahelical receptors is thought to regulate G protein signaling, receptor endocytosis, and non-canonical signaling via recruitment of β-arrestins. We investigated chemokine receptor functionality under phosphorylation-deficient and β-arrestin-deficient conditions by studying interneuron migration in the embryonic cortex. This process depends on CXCL12, CXCR4, G protein signaling and on the atypical CXCL12 receptor ACKR3. We found that phosphorylation was crucial, whereas β-arrestins were dispensable for ACKR3-mediated control of CXCL12 levels in vivo. Cortices of mice expressing phosphorylation-deficient ACKR3 exhibited a major interneuron migration defect, which was accompanied by excessive activation and loss of CXCR4. Cxcl12-overexpressing mice mimicked this phenotype. Excess CXCL12 caused lysosomal CXCR4 degradation, loss of CXCR4 responsiveness, and, ultimately, similar motility defects as Cxcl12 deficiency. By contrast, β-arrestin deficiency caused only a subtle migration defect mimicked by CXCR4 gain of function. These findings demonstrate that phosphorylation regulates atypical chemokine receptor function without β-arrestin involvement in chemokine sequestration and non-canonical signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Lung alveolar type I cells (AT1) and alveolar type II cells (AT2) regulate the structural integrity and function of alveoli. AT1, covering ∼95% of the surface area, are responsible for gas exchange, whereas AT2 serve multiple functions, including alveolar repair through proliferation and differentiation into AT1. However, the signaling mechanisms for alveolar repair remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced acute lung injury in mice, that non-canonical Notch ligand Dlk1 (delta-like 1 homolog) is essential for AT2-to-AT1 differentiation. Notch signaling was activated in AT2 at the onset of repair but later suppressed by Dlk1. Deletion of Dlk1 in AT2 induced persistent Notch activation, resulting in stalled transition to AT1 and accumulation of an intermediate cell population that expressed low levels of both AT1 and AT2 markers. Thus, Dlk1 expression leads to precisely timed inhibition of Notch signaling and activates AT2-to-AT1 differentiation, leading to alveolar repair.

Abstract: Summary
The circadian clock and associated feeding rhythms have a profound impact on metabolism and the gut microbiome. To what extent microbiota reciprocally affect daily rhythms of physiology in the host remains elusive. Here, we analyzed transcriptome and metabolome profiles of male and female germ-free mice. While mRNA expression of circadian clock genes revealed subtle changes in liver, intestine, and white adipose tissue, germ-free mice showed considerably altered expression of genes associated with rhythmic physiology. Strikingly, the absence of the microbiome attenuated liver sexual dimorphism and sex-specific rhythmicity. The resulting feminization of male and masculinization of female germ-free animals is likely caused by altered sexual development and growth hormone secretion, associated with differential activation of xenobiotic receptors. This defines a novel mechanism by which the microbiome regulates host metabolism.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a good model for preclinical and clinical investigations, and alternative sources of MSCs are subject to intensive experiments. In this study, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated from heart and liver tissue of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). The flow-cytometry as well as RT-PCR were used to analyze the expression of a panel of cell surface markers CD44, CD90, CD31 and CD34. In the following, alizarin red, oil red-O and toluidine blue staining were carried out to evaluate the multi-lineage differentiation of zebrafish heart and liver tissue-derived MSCs. Subsequently, the gene and protein expression of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog as pluri-potent markers were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. In addition, MTT assay was used for cell proliferation potential and population doubling time (PDT) assessment. Also, the aging of cells was investigated by β-galactosidase activity assay. The results showed that, like other MSCs, zebrafish heart and liver tissue-derived MSCs were positive for mesenchymal, negative for hematopoietic markers and expressed pluripotent markers Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. Moreover, these cells were differentiated to osteocyte, adipocyte, and chondrocyte lineages following directed differentiation. It was found that PDT of zebrafish heart and liver tissue-derived MSCs were 50.67 and 46.61 h, respectively. These cells had significantly more rapid growth on day 4. Our results show that zebrafish heart and liver tissue-derived MSCs exhibited typical MSC characteristics including fibroblast morphology, multi-lineage differentiation capacity, pluripotency potential and expression of a typical set of classic MSC surface markers.

Abstract: Summary
The marsupial Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) faces extinction due to transmissible devil facial tumor disease (DFTD). To unveil the molecular underpinnings of this transmissible cancer, we combined pharmacological screens with an integrated systems-biology characterization. Sensitivity to inhibitors of ERBB tyrosine kinases correlated with their overexpression. Proteomic and DNA methylation analyses revealed tumor-specific signatures linked to the evolutionary conserved oncogenic STAT3. ERBB inhibition blocked phosphorylation of STAT3 and arrested cancer cells. Pharmacological blockade of ERBB or STAT3 prevented tumor growth in xenograft models and restored MHC class I expression. This link between the hyperactive ERBB-STAT3 axis and major histocompatibility complex class I-mediated tumor immunosurveillance provides mechanistic insights into horizontal transmissibility and puts forward a dual chemo-immunotherapeutic strategy to save Tasmanian devils from DFTD.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) are postulated to provide a continuous supply of osteoblasts throughout life. However, under certain conditions, the SSC population can become incorrectly specified or is not maintained, resulting in reduced osteoblast formation, decreased bone mass, and in severe cases, osteoporosis. Glutamine metabolism has emerged as a critical regulator of many cellular processes in diverse pathologies. The enzyme glutaminase (GLS) deaminates glutamine to form glutamate—the rate-limiting first step in glutamine metabolism. Using genetic and metabolic approaches, we demonstrate GLS and glutamine metabolism are required in SSCs to regulate osteoblast and adipocyte specification and bone formation. Mechanistically, transaminase-dependent α-ketoglutarate production is critical for the proliferation, specification, and differentiation of SSCs. Collectively, these data suggest stimulating GLS activity may provide a therapeutic approach to expand SSCs in aged individuals and enhance osteoblast differentiation and activity to increase bone mass.

Abstract: Nowadays there are various models of spinal cord injury (SCI) that recreate mechanisms of human SCI. The ex vivo modeling of injury is a robust approach, confronts with less experimental and ethical challenges. Currently almost all ex vivo models are obtained either from embryonic or postnatal animals, which can hardly mimic features of human SCI. This study was designed to develop SCI in slice culture of adult rats. Here, the lumbar enlargement of an adult rat was sliced and cultured. After seven days in vitro, a weight was dropped to simulate the injury. The result showed that although the rate of cell death in first days of in vitro was high, it reduced after 7 days and dropping a weight at the time caused significant rate of cell death in slices. It was shown that injury can disturb histological features and neuronal integrity in the slices. Treating the injured slices with valproic acid resulted in a significant decrease of TNF-α and increase of BDNF expression. Collected data revealed obtained slices from adult rat were able to adjust to the culture environment after 7 days and dropping a weight at the time point could simulate the injury. Besides mimicking the disturbing features of human SCI, this model can response to VPA pharmacological treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Cell survival is a critical and ubiquitous endpoint in biology. The broadly accepted colony formation assay (CFA) directly measures a cell’s ability to divide; however, it takes weeks to perform and is incompatible with high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies. Here, we describe the MicroColonyChip, which exploits microwell array technology to create an array of colonies. Unlike the CFA, where visible colonies are counted by eye, using fluorescence microscopy, microcolonies can be analyzed in days rather than weeks. Using automated analysis of microcolony size distributions, the MicroColonyChip achieves comparable sensitivity to the CFA (and greater sensitivity than the 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide [XTT] assay). Compared to CellTiter-Glo, the MicroColonyChip is as sensitive and also robust to artifacts caused by differences in initial cell seeding density. We demonstrate efficacy via studies of radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity and show that the approach is amenable to multiplexing. We conclude that the MicroColonyChip is a rapid and automated alternative for cell survival quantitation.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in tumor growth, progression, and therapeutic resistance, but interrogating the role of specific tumor-stromal interactions on tumorigenic phenotypes is challenging within in vivo tissues. Here, we tested whether three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting could improve in vitro models by incorporating multiple cell types into scaffold-free tumor tissues with defined architecture. We generated tumor tissues from distinct subtypes of breast or pancreatic cancer in relevant microenvironments and demonstrate that this technique can model patient-specific tumors by using primary patient tissue. We assess intrinsic, extrinsic, and spatial tumorigenic phenotypes in bioprinted tissues and find that cellular proliferation, extracellular matrix deposition, and cellular migration are altered in response to extrinsic signals or therapies. Together, this work demonstrates that multi-cell-type bioprinted tissues can recapitulate aspects of in vivo neoplastic tissues and provide a manipulable system for the interrogation of multiple tumorigenic endpoints in the context of distinct tumor microenvironments.

Abstract: Summary
The autophagy cargo receptor p62 facilitates the condensation of misfolded, ubiquitin-positive proteins and their degradation by autophagy, but the molecular mechanism of p62 signaling to the core autophagy machinery is unclear. Here, we show that disordered residues 326–380 of p62 directly interact with the C-terminal region (CTR) of FIP200. Crystal structure determination shows that the FIP200 CTR contains a dimeric globular domain that we designated the “Claw” for its shape. The interaction of p62 with FIP200 is mediated by a positively charged pocket in the Claw, enhanced by p62 phosphorylation, mutually exclusive with the binding of p62 to LC3B, and it promotes degradation of ubiquitinated cargo by autophagy. Furthermore, the recruitment of the FIP200 CTR slows the phase separation of ubiquitinated proteins by p62 in a reconstituted system. Our data provide the molecular basis for a crosstalk between cargo condensation and autophagosome formation.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) can be released by numerous cell types in vitro, are often protected within vesicles, and can modify recipient cell function. To determine how the composition and cellular sources of exRNAs and the extracellular vesicles (EVs) that carry them change in vivo during tissue inflammation, we analyzed bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from mice before and after lung allergen challenge. In the lung, extracellular microRNAs (ex-miRNAs) had a composition that was highly correlated with airway-lining epithelium. Using cell type-specific membrane tagging and single vesicle flow, we also found that 80% of detected vesicles were of epithelial origin. After the induction of allergic airway inflammation, miRNAs selectively expressed by immune cells, including miR-223 and miR-142a, increased and hematopoietic-cell-derived EVs also increased >2-fold. These data demonstrate that infiltrating immune cells release ex-miRNAs and EVs in inflamed tissues to alter the local extracellular environment.

Abstract: Summary
Inability to mediate fed-fast transitions in the liver is known to cause metabolic dysfunctions and diseases. Intuitively, a failure to inhibit futile translation of state-specific transcripts during fed-fast cycles would abrogate dynamic physiological transitions. Here, we have discovered hepatic fed microRNAs that target fasting-induced genes and are essential for a refed transition. Our findings highlight the role of these fed microRNAs in orchestrating system-level control over liver physiology and whole-body energetics. By targeting SIRT1, PGC1α, and their downstream genes, fed microRNAs regulate metabolic and mitochondrial pathways. MicroRNA expression, processing, and RISC loading oscillate during these cycles and possibly constitute an anticipatory mechanism. Fed-microRNA oscillations are deregulated during aging. Scavenging of hepatic fed microRNAs causes uncontrolled gluconeogenesis and failure in the catabolic-to-anabolic switching upon feeding, which are hallmarks of metabolic diseases. Besides identifying mechanisms that enable efficient physiological toggling, our study highlights fed microRNAs as candidate therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Intratumor mutational heterogeneity has been documented in primary non-small-cell lung cancer. Here, we elucidate mechanisms of tumor evolution and heterogeneity in metastatic thoracic tumors (lung adenocarcinoma and thymic carcinoma) using whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing, SNP array for copy-number alterations (CNAs), and mass-spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics of metastases obtained by rapid autopsy. APOBEC mutagenesis, promoted by increased expression of APOBEC3 region transcripts and associated with a high-risk APOBEC3 germline variant, correlated with mutational tumor heterogeneity. TP53 mutation status was associated with APOBEC hypermutator status. Interferon pathways were enriched in tumors with high APOBEC mutagenesis and IFN-γ-induced expression of APOBEC3B in lung adenocarcinoma cells, suggesting that the immune microenvironment may promote mutational heterogeneity. CNAs occurring late in tumor evolution correlated with downstream transcriptomic and proteomic heterogeneity, although global proteomic heterogeneity was significantly greater than transcriptomic and CNA heterogeneity. These results illustrate key mechanisms underlying multi-dimensional heterogeneity in metastatic thoracic tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Following implantation, the epiblast (EPI) cells transit from the naive to primed pluripotency, accompanied by dynamic changes in X chromosome activity in females. To investigate the molecular attributes of this process, we performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of 1,724 cells of E5.25, E5.5, E6.25, and E6.5 mouse embryos. We identified three cellular states in the EPI cells that capture the transition along the pluripotency continuum and the acquisition of primitive streak propensity. The transition of three EPI states was driven by inductive signaling activity emanating from the visceral endoderm (VE). In the EPI of female embryos, X chromosome reactivation (XCR) was initiated prior to the completion of imprinted X chromosome inactivation (XCI), and the ensuing random XCI was highly asynchronous. Moreover, imprinted paternal XCI proceeded faster in the VE than the extraembryonic ectoderm. Our study has provided a detailed molecular roadmap of the emergent lineage commitment before gastrulation and characterized X chromosome dynamics during early mouse development.

Abstract: Summary
Neurite fasciculation through contact-dependent signaling is important for the wiring and function of the neuronal circuits. Here, we describe a type of axon-dendrite fasciculation in C. elegans, where proximal dendrites of the nociceptor PVD adhere to the axon of the ALA interneuron. This axon-dendrite fasciculation is mediated by a previously uncharacterized adhesive signaling by the ALA membrane signal SAX-7/L1CAM and the PVD receptor SAX-3/Robo but independent of Slit. L1CAM physically interacts with Robo and instructs dendrite adhesion in a Robo-dependent manner. Fasciculation mediated by L1CAM-Robo signaling aligns F-actin dynamics in the dendrite growth cone and facilitates dynamic growth cone behaviors for efficient dendrite guidance. Disruption of PVD dendrite fasciculation impairs nociceptive mechanosensation and rhythmicity in body curvature, suggesting that dendrite fasciculation governs the functions of mechanosensory circuits. Our work elucidates the molecular mechanisms by which adhesive axon-dendrite signaling shapes the construction and function of sensory neuronal circuits.

Abstract: The rodlet structure present on the Aspergillus fumigatus conidial surface hides conidia from immune recognition. In spite of the essential biological role of the rodlets, the molecular basis for their self-assembly and disaggregation is not known. Analysis of the soluble forms of conidia-extracted and recombinant RodA by NMR spectroscopy has indicated the importance of disulfide bonds and identified two dynamic regions as likely candidates for conformational change and intermolecular interactions during conversion of RodA into the amyloid rodlet structure. Point mutations introduced into the RODA sequence confirmed that (1) mutation of a single cysteine was sufficient to block rodlet formation on the conidial surface and (2) both presumed amyloidogenic regions were needed for proper rodlet assembly. Mutations in the two putative amyloidogenic regions retarded and disturbed, but did not completely inhibit, the formation of the rodlets in vitro and on the conidial surface. Even in a disturbed form, the presence of rodlets on the surface of the conidia was sufficient to immunosilence the conidium. However, in contrast to the parental conidia, long exposure of mutant conidia lacking disulfide bridges within RodA or expressing RodA carrying the double (I115S/I146G) mutation activated dendritic cells with the subsequent secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The immune reactivity of the RodA mutant conidia was not due to a modification in the RodA structure, but to the exposure of different pathogen-associated molecular patterns on the surface as a result of the modification of the rodlet surface layer. The full degradation of the rodlet layer, which occurs during early germination, is due to a complex array of cell wall bound proteases. As reported earlier, this loss of the rodlet layer lead to a strong anti-fumigatus host immune response in mouse lungs.

Abstract: Summary
KRAS mutations are the earliest events found in approximately 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). However, little is known as to why KRAS mutations preferentially occur in PDACs and what processes/factors generate these mutations. While abnormal carbohydrate metabolism is associated with a high risk of pancreatic cancer, it remains elusive whether a direct relationship between KRAS mutations and sugar metabolism exists. Here, we show that under high-glucose conditions, cellular O-GlcNAcylation is significantly elevated in pancreatic cells that exhibit lower phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity than other cell types. This post-translational modification specifically compromises the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) activity, leading to deficiency in dNTP pools, genomic DNA alterations with KRAS mutations, and cellular transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting bromodomains (BRDs) of the bromo-and-extra-terminal (BET) family offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention in cancer and other diseases. Here, we profile the interactomes of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT following treatment with the pan-BET BRD inhibitor JQ1, revealing broad rewiring of the interaction landscape, with three distinct classes of behavior for the 603 unique interactors identified. A group of proteins associate in a JQ1-sensitive manner with BET BRDs through canonical and new binding modes, while two classes of extra-terminal (ET)-domain binding motifs mediate acetylation-independent interactions. Last, we identify an unexpected increase in several interactions following JQ1 treatment that define negative functions for BRD3 in the regulation of rRNA synthesis and potentially RNAPII-dependent gene expression that result in decreased cell proliferation. Together, our data highlight the contributions of BET protein modules to their interactomes allowing for a better understanding of pharmacological rewiring in response to JQ1.

Abstract: Summary
Adenosine deaminase associated with RNA1 (ADAR1) deregulation contributes to therapeutic resistance in many malignancies. Here we show that ADAR1-induced hyper-editing in normal human hematopoietic progenitors impairs miR-26a maturation, which represses CDKN1A expression indirectly via EZH2, thereby accelerating cell-cycle transit. However, in blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia progenitors, loss of EZH2 expression and increased CDKN1A oppose cell-cycle transit. Moreover, A-to-I editing of both the MDM2 regulatory microRNA and its binding site within the 3′ UTR region stabilizes MDM2 transcripts, thereby enhancing blast crisis progenitor propagation. These data reveal a dual mechanism governing malignant transformation of progenitors that is predicated on hyper-editing of cell-cycle-regulatory miRNAs and the 3′ UTR binding site of tumor suppressor miRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Prolonged intervention studies investigating molecular metabolism are necessary for a deeper understanding of dietary effects on health. Here we provide mechanistic information about metabolic adaptation to fat-rich diets. Healthy, slightly overweight men ingested saturated or polyunsaturated fat-rich diets for 6 weeks during weight maintenance. Hyperinsulinemic clamps combined with leg balance technique revealed unchanged peripheral insulin sensitivity, independent of fatty acid type. Both diets increased fat oxidation potential in muscle. Hepatic insulin clearance increased, while glucose production, de novo lipogenesis, and plasma triacylglycerol decreased. High fat intake changed the plasma proteome in the immune-supporting direction and the gut microbiome displayed changes at taxonomical and functional level with polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). In mice, eucaloric feeding of human PUFA and saturated fatty acid diets lowered hepatic triacylglycerol content compared with low-fat-fed control mice, and induced adaptations in the liver supportive of decreased gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. Intake of fat-rich diets thus induces extensive metabolic adaptations enabling disposition of dietary fat without metabolic complications.

Abstract: Summary
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease initiated by the invasion of pancreatic islets by immune cells that selectively kill the β cells. We found that rodent and human T lymphocytes release exosomes containing the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, and miR-155, which can be transferred in active form to β cells favoring apoptosis. Inactivation of these miRNAs in recipient β cells prevents exosome-mediated apoptosis and protects non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice from diabetes development. Islets from protected NOD mice display higher insulin levels, lower insulitis scores, and reduced inflammation. Looking at the mechanisms underlying exosome action, we found that T lymphocyte exosomes trigger apoptosis and the expression of genes involved in chemokine signaling, including Ccl2, Ccl7, and Cxcl10, exclusively in β cells. The induction of these genes may promote the recruitment of immune cells and exacerbate β cell death during the autoimmune attack. Our data point to exosomal-miRNA transfer as a communication mode between immune and insulin-secreting cells.

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication commences at eukaryotic replication origins following assembly and activation of bidirectional CMG helicases. Once activated, CMG unwinds the parental DNA duplex and DNA polymerase α-primase initiates synthesis on both template strands. By utilizing an origin-dependent replication system using purified yeast proteins, we have mapped start sites for leading-strand replication. Synthesis is mostly initiated outside the origin sequence. Strikingly, rightward leading strands are primed left of the origin and vice versa. We show that each leading strand is established from a lagging-strand primer synthesized by the replisome on the opposite side of the origin. Preventing elongation of primers synthesized left of the origin blocked rightward leading strands, demonstrating that replisomes are interdependent for leading-strand synthesis establishment. The mechanism we reveal negates the need for dedicated leading-strand priming and necessitates a crucial role for the lagging-strand polymerase Pol δ in connecting the nascent leading strand with the advancing replisome.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell time-lapse data provide the means for disentangling sources of cell-to-cell and intra-cellular variability, a key step for understanding heterogeneity in cell populations. However, single-cell analysis with dynamic models is a challenging open problem: current inference methods address only single-gene expression or neglect parameter correlations. We report on a simple, flexible, and scalable method for estimating cell-specific and population-average parameters of non-linear mixed-effects models of cellular networks, demonstrating its accuracy with a published model and dataset. We also propose sensitivity analysis for identifying which biological sub-processes quantitatively and dynamically contribute to cell-to-cell variability. Our application to endocytosis in yeast demonstrates that dynamic models of realistic size can be developed for the analysis of single-cell data and that shifting the focus from single reactions or parameters to nuanced and time-dependent contributions of sub-processes helps biological interpretation. Generality and simplicity of the approach will facilitate customized extensions for analyzing single-cell dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity induces lipotoxic cardiomyopathy, a condition in which lipid accumulation in cardiomyocytes causes cardiac dysfunction. Here, we show that glycogen synthase kinase-3α (GSK-3α) mediates lipid accumulation in the heart. Fatty acids (FAs) upregulate GSK-3α, which phosphorylates PPARα at Ser280 in the ligand-binding domain (LBD). This modification ligand independently enhances transcription of a subset of PPARα targets, selectively stimulating FA uptake and storage, but not oxidation, thereby promoting lipid accumulation. Constitutively active GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, was sufficient to drive PPARα signaling, while cardiac-specific knockdown of GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, or replacement of PPARα Ser280 with Ala conferred resistance to lipotoxicity in the heart. Fibrates, PPARα ligands, inhibited phosphorylation of PPARα at Ser280 by inhibiting the interaction of GSK-3α with the LBD of PPARα, thereby reversing lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. These results suggest that GSK-3α promotes lipid anabolism through PPARα-Ser280 phosphorylation, which underlies the development of lipotoxic cardiomyopathy in the context of obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and cellular metabolism promotes tumor aggressiveness by sustaining the activity of key growth, invasion, and survival pathways. Yet mechanisms by which biophysical properties of ECM relate to metabolic processes and tumor progression remain undefined. In both cancer cells and carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), we found that ECM stiffening mechanoactivates glycolysis and glutamine metabolism and thus coordinates non-essential amino acid flux within the tumor niche. Specifically, we demonstrate a metabolic crosstalk between CAF and cancer cells in which CAF-derived aspartate sustains cancer cell proliferation, while cancer cell-derived glutamate balances the redox state of CAFs to promote ECM remodeling. Collectively, our findings link mechanical stimuli to dysregulated tumor metabolism and thereby highlight a new metabolic network within tumors in which diverse fuel sources are used to promote growth and aggressiveness. Furthermore, this study identifies potential metabolic drug targets for therapeutic development in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Guard cells integrate various hormone signals and environmental cues to balance plant gas exchange and transpiration. The wounding-associated hormone jasmonic acid (JA) and the drought hormone abscisic acid (ABA) both trigger stomatal closure. In contrast to ABA however, the molecular mechanisms of JA-induced stomatal closure have remained largely elusive. Here, we identify a fast signaling pathway for JA targeting the K+ efflux channel GORK. Wounding triggers both local and systemic stomatal closure by activation of the JA signaling cascade followed by GORK phosphorylation and activation through CBL1-CIPK5 Ca2+ sensor-kinase complexes. GORK activation strictly depends on plasma membrane targeting and Ca2+ binding of CBL1-CIPK5 complexes. Accordingly, in gork, cbl1, and cipk5 mutants, JA-induced stomatal closure is specifically abolished. The ABA-coreceptor ABI2 counteracts CBL1-CIPK5-dependent GORK activation. Hence, JA-induced Ca2+ signaling in response to biotic stress converges with the ABA-mediated drought stress pathway to facilitate GORK-mediated stomatal closure upon wounding.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogenesis has been intensely studied in rodents but remains poorly understood in humans. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze human testes. Clustering analysis of neonatal testes reveals several cell subsets, including cell populations with characteristics of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). In adult testes, we identify four undifferentiated spermatogonia (SPG) clusters, each of which expresses specific marker genes. We identify protein markers for the most primitive SPG state, allowing us to purify this likely SSC-enriched cell subset. We map the timeline of male germ cell development from PGCs through fetal germ cells to differentiating adult SPG stages. We also define somatic cell subsets in both neonatal and adult testes and trace their developmental trajectories. Our data provide a blueprint of the developing human male germline and supporting somatic cells. The PGC-like and SSC markers are candidates to be used for SSC therapy to treat infertility.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) induce an age-dependent loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. We have identified Furin 1, a pro-protein convertase, as a translational target of LRRK2 in DA neurons. Transgenic knockdown of Furin1 or its substrate the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) ligand glass bottom boat (Gbb) protects against LRRK2-induced loss of DA neurons. LRRK2 enhances the accumulation of phosphorylated Mad (pMad) in the nuclei of glial cells in the vicinity of DA neurons but not in DA neurons. Consistently, exposure to paraquat enhances Furin 1 levels in DA neurons and induces BMP signaling in glia. In support of a neuron-glial signaling model, knocking down BMP pathway members only in glia, but not in neurons, can protect against paraquat toxicity. We propose that a neuron-glial BMP-signaling cascade is critical for mediating age-dependent neurodegeneration in two models of Parkinson’s disease, thus opening avenues for future therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a retinal-cerebellar degenerative disorder caused by CAG-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansions in the ataxin-7 gene. As many SCA7 clinical phenotypes occur in mitochondrial disorders, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy of patients revealed altered energy metabolism, we considered a role for mitochondrial dysfunction. Studies of SCA7 mice uncovered marked impairments in oxygen consumption and respiratory exchange. When we examined cerebellar Purkinje cells in mice, we observed mitochondrial network abnormalities, with enlarged mitochondria upon ultrastructural analysis. We developed stem cell models from patients and created stem cell knockout rescue systems, documenting mitochondrial morphology defects, impaired oxidative metabolism, and reduced expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) production enzymes in SCA7 models. We observed NAD+ reductions in mitochondria of SCA7 patient NPCs using ratiometric fluorescent sensors and documented alterations in tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in patients. Our results indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction, stemming from decreased NAD+, is a defining feature of SCA7.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation and H3K9me are hallmarks of heterochromatin in plants and mammals, and are successfully maintained across generations. The biochemical and structural basis for this maintenance is poorly understood. The maintenance DNA methyltransferase from Zea mays, ZMET2, recognizes dimethylation of H3K9 via a chromodomain (CD) and a bromo adjacent homology (BAH) domain, which flank the catalytic domain. Here, we show that dinucleosomes are the preferred ZMET2 substrate, with DNA methylation preferentially targeted to linker DNA. Electron microscopy shows one ZMET2 molecule bridging two nucleosomes within a dinucleosome. We find that the CD stabilizes binding, whereas the BAH domain enables allosteric activation by the H3K9me mark. ZMET2 further couples recognition of H3K9me to an increase in the specificity for hemimethylated versus unmethylated DNA. We propose a model in which synergistic coupling between recognition of nucleosome spacing, H3K9 methylation, and DNA modification allows ZMET2 to maintain DNA methylation in heterochromatin with high fidelity.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomerase-independent but recombination-dependent pathway that maintains telomeres. Here, we describe an assay to visualize ALT-mediated telomeric DNA synthesis in ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) without DNA-damaging agents or replication inhibitors. Using this assay, we find that ALT occurs through two distinct mechanisms. One of the ALT mechanisms requires RAD52, a protein implicated in break-induced DNA replication (BIR). We demonstrate that RAD52 directly promotes telomeric D-loop formation in vitro and is required for maintaining telomeres in ALT-positive cells. Unexpectedly, however, RAD52 is dispensable for C-circle formation, a hallmark of ALT. In RAD52-knockout ALT cells, C-circle formation and RAD52-independent ALT DNA synthesis gradually increase as telomeres are shortened, and these activities are dependent on BLM and BIR proteins POLD3 and POLD4. These results suggest that ALT occurs through a RAD52-dependent and a RAD52-independent BIR pathway, revealing the bifurcated framework and dynamic nature of this process.

Abstract: Summary
The control of systemic metabolic homeostasis involves complex inter-tissue programs that coordinate energy production, storage, and consumption, to maintain organismal fitness upon environmental challenges. The mechanisms driving such programs are largely unknown. Here, we show that enteroendocrine cells in the adult Drosophila intestine respond to nutrients by secreting the hormone Bursicon α, which signals via its neuronal receptor DLgr2. Bursicon α/DLgr2 regulate energy metabolism through a neuronal relay leading to the restriction of glucagon-like, adipokinetic hormone (AKH) production by the corpora cardiaca and subsequent modulation of AKH receptor signaling within the adipose tissue. Impaired Bursicon α/DLgr2 signaling leads to exacerbated glucose oxidation and depletion of energy stores with consequent reduced organismal resistance to nutrient restrictive conditions. Altogether, our work reveals an intestinal/neuronal/adipose tissue inter-organ communication network that is essential to restrict the use of energy and that may provide insights into the physiopathology of endocrine-regulated metabolic homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The yeast protein Ipa1 was recently discovered to interact with the Ysh1 endonuclease of the pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation (C/P) machinery, and Ipa1 mutation impairs 3′end processing. We report that Ipa1 globally promotes proper transcription termination and poly(A) site selection, but with variable effects on genes depending upon the specific configurations of polyadenylation signals. Our findings suggest that the role of Ipa1 in termination is mediated through interaction with Ysh1, since Ipa1 mutation leads to decrease in Ysh1 and poor recruitment of the C/P complex to a transcribed gene. The Ipa1 association with transcriptionally active chromatin resembles that of elongation factors, and the mutant shows defective Pol II elongation kinetics in vivo. Ysh1 overexpression in the Ipa1 mutant rescues the termination defect, but not the mutant’s sensitivity to 6-azauracil, an indicator of defective elongation. Our findings support a model in which an Ipa1/Ysh1 complex helps coordinate transcription elongation and 3′ end processing.

Abstract: Summary
Repeated drug use has long-lasting effects on plasticity throughout the brain’s reward and memory systems. Environmental cues that are associated with drugs of abuse can elicit craving and relapse, but the neural circuits responsible for driving drug-cue-related behaviors have not been well delineated, creating a hurdle for the development of effective relapse prevention therapies. In this study, we used a cocaine+cue self-administration paradigm followed by cue re-exposure to establish that the strength of the drug cue association corresponds to the strength of synapses between the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) of the thalamus and the lateral amygdala (LA). Furthermore, we demonstrate, via optogenetically induced LTD of MGN-LA synapses, that reversing cocaine-induced potentiation of this pathway is sufficient to inhibit cue-induced relapse-like behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Elevations in branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) associate with numerous systemic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and heart failure. However, an integrated understanding of whole-body BCAA metabolism remains lacking. Here, we employ in vivo isotopic tracing to systemically quantify BCAA oxidation in healthy and insulin-resistant mice. We find that most tissues rapidly oxidize BCAAs into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, with the greatest quantity occurring in muscle, brown fat, liver, kidneys, and heart. Notably, pancreas supplies 20% of its TCA carbons from BCAAs. Genetic and pharmacologic suppression of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, a clinically targeted regulatory kinase, induces BCAA oxidation primarily in skeletal muscle of healthy mice. While insulin acutely increases BCAA oxidation in cardiac and skeletal muscle, chronically insulin-resistant mice show blunted BCAA oxidation in adipose tissues and liver, shifting BCAA oxidation toward muscle. Together, this work provides a quantitative framework for understanding systemic BCAA oxidation in health and insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) is an RNA-guided DNA-cutting nuclease that has been repurposed for genome editing. Upon target DNA binding, Cas12a cleaves both the target DNA in cis and non-target single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) in trans. To elucidate the molecular basis for both DNase cleavage modes, we performed structural and biochemical studies on Francisella novicida Cas12a. We show that guide RNA-target strand DNA hybridization conformationally activates Cas12a, triggering its trans-acting, non-specific, single-stranded DNase activity. In turn, cis cleavage of double-stranded DNA targets is a result of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent DNA duplex unwinding, electrostatic stabilization of the displaced non-target DNA strand, and ordered sequential cleavage of the non-target and target DNA strands. Cas12a releases the PAM-distal DNA cleavage product and remains bound to the PAM-proximal DNA cleavage product in a catalytically competent, trans-active state. Together, these results provide a revised model for the molecular mechanisms of both the cis- and the trans-acting DNase activities of Cas12a enzymes, enabling their further exploitation as genome editing tools.

Abstract: Summary
Human enteroids—epithelial spheroids derived from primary gastrointestinal tissue—are a promising model to study pathogen-epithelial interactions. However, accessing the apical enteroid surface is challenging because it is enclosed within the spheroid. We developed a technique to reverse enteroid polarity such that the apical surface everts to face the media. Apical-out enteroids maintain proper polarity and barrier function, differentiate into the major intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) types, and exhibit polarized absorption of nutrients. We used this model to study host-pathogen interactions and identified distinct polarity-specific patterns of infection by invasive enteropathogens. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium targets IEC apical surfaces for invasion via cytoskeletal rearrangements, and Listeria monocytogenes, which binds to basolateral receptors, invade apical surfaces at sites of cell extrusion. Despite different modes of entry, both pathogens exit the epithelium within apically extruding enteroid cells. This model will enable further examination of IECs in health and disease.

Abstract: The omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is known to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest via the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in many types of cancers. However, the roles of DHA in drug-resistant cancer cells have not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of DHA in cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer SNU-601/cis2 cells. DHA was found to induce ROS-dependent apoptosis in these cells. The inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) blocker 2-aminoethyl diphenylboninate (2-APB) reduced DHA-induced ROS production, consequently reducing apoptosis. We also found that G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120), a receptor of long-chain fatty acids, is expressed in SNU-601/cis2 cells, and the knockdown of GPR120 using specific shRNAs alleviated DHA-mediated ROS production and apoptosis. GPR120 knockdown reduced the expression of ER stress response genes, similar to the case for the pre-treatment of the cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, or 2-APB. Indeed, the knockdown of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a transcription factor that functions under ER stress conditions, markedly reduced DHA-mediated apoptosis, indicating that CHOP plays an essential role in the anti-cancer activity of DHA. These results suggest that GPR120 mediates DHA-induced apoptosis by regulating IP3R, ROS, and ER stress levels in cisplatin-resistant cancer cells, and that GPR120 is an effective chemotherapeutic target for cisplatin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Mafb and c-Maf transcription factor (TF) expression is enriched in medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) lineages, beginning in late-secondary progenitors and continuing into mature parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SST+) interneurons. However, the functions of Maf TFs in MGE development remain to be elucidated. Herein, Mafb and c-Maf were conditionally deleted, alone and together, in the MGE and its lineages. Analyses of Maf mutant mice revealed redundant functions of Mafb and c-Maf in secondary MGE progenitors, where they repress the generation of SST+ cortical and hippocampal interneurons. By contrast, Mafb and c-Maf have distinct roles in postnatal cortical interneuron (CIN) morphological maturation, synaptogenesis, and cortical circuit integration. Thus, Mafb and c-Maf have redundant and opposing functions at different steps in CIN development.

Abstract: Summary
Dorsal raphe (DR) serotonin neurons provide a major input to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Here, we show that DR serotonin transporter (SERT) neurons establish both asymmetric and symmetric synapses on VTA dopamine neurons, but most of these synapses are asymmetric. Moreover, the DR-SERT terminals making asymmetric synapses on VTA dopamine neurons coexpress vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGluT3; transporter for accumulation of glutamate for its synaptic release), suggesting the excitatory nature of these synapses. VTA photoactivation of DR-SERT fibers promotes conditioned place preference, elicits excitatory currents on mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons, increases their firing, and evokes dopamine release in nucleus accumbens. These effects are blocked by VTA inactivation of glutamate and serotonin receptors, supporting the idea of glutamate release in VTA from dual DR SERT-VGluT3 inputs. Our findings suggest a path-specific input from DR serotonergic neurons to VTA that promotes reward by the release of glutamate and activation of mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Mice deficient for SIRT6 exhibit a severely shortened lifespan, growth retardation, and highly elevated LINE1 (L1) activity. Here we report that SIRT6-deficient cells and tissues accumulate abundant cytoplasmic L1 cDNA, which triggers strong type I interferon response via activation of cGAS. Remarkably, nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), which inhibit L1 retrotransposition, significantly improved health and lifespan of SIRT6 knockout mice and completely rescued type I interferon response. In tissue culture, inhibition of L1 with siRNA or NRTIs abrogated type I interferon response, in addition to a significant reduction of DNA damage markers. These results indicate that L1 activation contributes to the pathologies of SIRT6 knockout mice. Similarly, L1 transcription, cytoplasmic cDNA copy number, and type I interferons were elevated in the wild-type aged mice. As sterile inflammation is a hallmark of aging, we propose that modulating L1 activity may be an important strategy for attenuating age-related pathologies.

Abstract: Sevoflurane is a widely used anesthetics in surgery and considered as a safe reagent for clinical use. However, recent studies demonstrated that sevoflurane has a neurotoxic effect in central nervous system. Thus, finding ways to alleviate the side effect of sevoflurane is of importance. In this study, we identified the neuroprotective role of midazolam in hippocampal neurons. Midazolam treatment could alleviate the neuronal death and promote the neuronal maturation in hippocampal neurons in vitro. In vivo studies demonstrated that midazolam injection could improve behavioral deficit in sevoflurane-exposed animals. The anti-apoptotic function of midazolam in sevoflurane-exposed neurons was mediated by ERK signaling. Collectively, we elucidated a new role of midazolam in preventing hippocampal neuronal death from sevoflurane exposure, potentially providing a new strategy to resist the neurotoxicity in the clinical application of sevoflurane.

Abstract: Summary
Daily rhythms in animal physiology are driven by endogenous circadian clocks in part through rest-activity and feeding-fasting cycles. Here, we examined principles that govern daily respiration. We monitored oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide release, as well as tissue oxygenation in freely moving animals to specifically dissect the role of circadian clocks and feeding time on daily respiration. We found that daily rhythms in oxygen and carbon dioxide are clock controlled and that time-restricted feeding restores their rhythmicity in clock-deficient mice. Remarkably, day-time feeding dissociated oxygen rhythms from carbon dioxide oscillations, whereby oxygen followed activity, and carbon dioxide was shifted and aligned with food intake. In addition, changes in carbon dioxide levels altered clock gene expression and phase shifted the clock. Collectively, our findings indicate that oxygen and carbon dioxide rhythms are clock controlled and feeding regulated and support a potential role for carbon dioxide in phase resetting peripheral clocks upon feeding.

Abstract: An imbalance in Ca2+ homeostasis represents an early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Presenilin-1 and -2 (PS1 and PS2) mutations, the major cause of familial AD (FAD), have been extensively associated with alterations in different Ca2+ signaling pathways, in particular those handled by storage compartments. However, FAD-PSs effect on organelles Ca2+ content is still debated and the mechanism of action of mutant proteins is unclear. To fulfil the need of a direct investigation of intracellular stores Ca2+ dynamics, we here present a detailed and quantitative single-cell analysis of FAD-PSs effects on organelle Ca2+ handling using specifically targeted, FRET (Fluorescence/Förster Resonance Energy Transfer)-based Ca2+ indicators. In SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and in patient-derived fibroblasts expressing different FAD-PSs mutations, we directly measured Ca2+ concentration within the main intracellular Ca2+ stores, e.g., Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and Golgi Apparatus (GA) medial- and trans-compartment. We unambiguously demonstrate that the expression of FAD-PS2 mutants, but not FAD-PS1, in either SH-SY5Y cells or FAD patient-derived fibroblasts, is able to alter Ca2+ handling of ER and medial-GA, but not trans-GA, reducing, compared to control cells, the Ca2+ content within these organelles by partially blocking SERCA (Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+-ATPase) activity. Moreover, by using a cytosolic Ca2+ probe, we show that the expression of both FAD-PS1 and -PS2 reduces the Ca2+ influx activated by stores depletion (Store-Operated Ca2+ Entry; SOCE), by decreasing the expression levels of one of the key molecules, STIM1 (STromal Interaction Molecule 1), controlling this pathway. Our data indicate that FAD-linked PSs mutants differentially modulate the Ca2+ content of intracellular stores yet leading to a complex dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis, which represents a common disease phenotype of AD.

Abstract: Summary
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) remains an unmet medical challenge. Here, we unravel an unanticipated metabolic heterogeneity in HGSOC. By combining proteomic, metabolomic, and bioergenetic analyses, we identify two molecular subgroups, low- and high-OXPHOS. While low-OXPHOS exhibit a glycolytic metabolism, high-OXPHOS HGSOCs rely on oxidative phosphorylation, supported by glutamine and fatty acid oxidation, and show chronic oxidative stress. We identify an important role for the PML-PGC-1α axis in the metabolic features of high-OXPHOS HGSOC. In high-OXPHOS tumors, chronic oxidative stress promotes aggregation of PML-nuclear bodies, resulting in activation of the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α. Active PGC-1α increases synthesis of electron transport chain complexes, thereby promoting mitochondrial respiration. Importantly, high-OXPHOS HGSOCs exhibit increased response to conventional chemotherapies, in which increased oxidative stress, PML, and potentially ferroptosis play key functions. Collectively, our data establish a stress-mediated PML-PGC-1α-dependent mechanism that promotes OXPHOS metabolism and chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Local circuit GABAergic inhibitory interneurons control the integration and transfer of information in many brain regions. Several different forms of plasticity reported at interneuron excitatory synapses are triggered by cell- and synapse-specific postsynaptic calcium (Ca2+) mechanisms. To support this function, the spatiotemporal dynamics of dendritic Ca2+ elevations must be tightly regulated. While the dynamics of postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling through activation of different Ca2+ sources has been explored, the Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms that operate in interneuron dendrites during different patterns of activity remain largely unknown. Using a combination of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and two-photon Ca2+ imaging in acute mouse hippocampal slices, we characterized the Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms activated by Ca2+ transients (CaTs) associated with backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) in dendrites of hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons. Our data showed that Ca2+ clearance increased as a function of activity, pointing to an activity-dependent recruitment of specific Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms. bAP-CaTs were significantly prolonged in the presence of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) inhibitors as well as the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and the mitochondria Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) blockers. While PMCA, NCX and SERCA pumps cooperated in the cytosolic Ca2+ removal at a wide range of concentrations, the MCU was only activated at higher Ca2+ loads produced by repetitive interneuron firing. These results identify a division of labor between distinct Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms shaping dendritic Ca2+ dynamics and possibly contributing to activity-dependent regulation of synaptic inputs in interneurons. In addition, the MCU activated by larger Ca2+ levels may be involved in the activity-dependent ATP production or interneuron-selective vulnerability associated with cytosolic Ca2+ overloads under pathological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
In Parkinson’s disease (PD), α-synuclein (αS) pathologically impacts the brain, a highly lipid-rich organ. We investigated how alterations in αS or lipid/fatty acid homeostasis affect each other. Lipidomic profiling of human αS-expressing yeast revealed increases in oleic acid (OA, 18:1), diglycerides, and triglycerides. These findings were recapitulated in rodent and human neuronal models of αS dyshomeostasis (overexpression; patient-derived triplication or E46K mutation; E46K mice). Preventing lipid droplet formation or augmenting OA increased αS yeast toxicity; suppressing the OA-generating enzyme stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) was protective. Genetic or pharmacological SCD inhibition ameliorated toxicity in αS-overexpressing rat neurons. In a C. elegans model, SCD knockout prevented αS-induced dopaminergic degeneration. Conversely, we observed detrimental effects of OA on αS homeostasis: in human neural cells, excess OA caused αS inclusion formation, which was reversed by SCD inhibition. Thus, monounsaturated fatty acid metabolism is pivotal for αS-induced neurotoxicity, and inhibiting SCD represents a novel PD therapeutic approach.

Abstract: Summary
Innate immunity is central to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, but it remains unclear why immunity is altered in the disease state and whether changes in immunity are a cause or a consequence of neuronal dysfunction. Here, we identify a molecular pathway that links innate immunity to age-dependent loss of dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila. We find, first, that altering the expression of the activating subunit of the Cdk5 protein kinase (Cdk5α) causes severe disruption of autophagy. Second, this disruption of autophagy is both necessary and sufficient to cause the hyperactivation of innate immunity, particularly expression of anti-microbial peptides. Finally, it is the upregulation of immunity that induces the age-dependent death of dopaminergic neurons. Given the dysregulation of Cdk5 and innate immunity in human neurodegeneration and the conserved role of the kinase in the regulation of autophagy, this sequence is likely to have direct application to the chain of events in human neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Summary
In Huntington disease (HD), the analysis of tissue-specific CAG repeat length effects has been challenging, given the difficulty in obtaining relevant patient tissues with a broad range of CAG repeat lengths. We used genome editing to generate an allelic panel of isogenic HD (IsoHD) human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines carrying varying CAG repeat lengths in the first exon of HTT. Functional analyses in differentiated neural cells revealed CAG repeat length-related abnormalities in mitochondrial respiration and oxidative stress and enhanced susceptibility to DNA damage. To explore tissue-specific effects in HD, we differentiated the IsoHD panel into neural progenitor cells, neurons, hepatocytes, and muscle cells. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the resultant cell types identified CAG repeat length-dependent and cell-type-specific molecular phenotypes. We anticipate that the IsoHD panel and transcriptomic and proteomic data will serve as a versatile, open-access platform to dissect the molecular factors contributing to HD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Activating mutations in GNAQ/GNA11, encoding Gαq G proteins, are initiating oncogenic events in uveal melanoma (UM). However, there are no effective therapies for UM. Using an integrated bioinformatics pipeline, we found that PTK2, encoding focal adhesion kinase (FAK), represents a candidate synthetic lethal gene with GNAQ activation. We show that Gαq activates FAK through TRIO-RhoA non-canonical Gαq-signaling, and genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of FAK inhibits UM growth. Analysis of the FAK-regulated transcriptome demonstrated that GNAQ stimulates YAP through FAK. Dissection of the underlying mechanism revealed that FAK regulates YAP by tyrosine phosphorylation of MOB1, inhibiting core Hippo signaling. Our findings establish FAK as a potential therapeutic target for UM and other Gαq-driven pathophysiologies that involve unrestrained YAP function.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas immunity requires integration of short, foreign DNA fragments into the host genome at the CRISPR locus, a site consisting of alternating repeat sequences and foreign-derived spacers. In most CRISPR systems, the proteins Cas1 and Cas2 form the integration complex and are both essential for DNA acquisition. Most type V-C and V-D systems lack the cas2 gene and have unusually short CRISPR repeats and spacers. Here, we show that a mini-integrase comprising the type V-C Cas1 protein alone catalyzes DNA integration with a preference for short (17- to 19-base-pair) DNA fragments. The mini-integrase has weak specificity for the CRISPR array. We present evidence that the Cas1 proteins form a tetramer for integration. Our findings support a model of a minimal integrase with an internal ruler mechanism that favors shorter repeats and spacers. This minimal integrase may represent the function of the ancestral Cas1 prior to Cas2 adoption.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear-encoded mutations causing metabolic and degenerative diseases have highly variable expressivity. Patients sharing the homozygous mutation (c.523delC) in the adenine nucleotide translocator 1 gene (SLC25A4, ANT1) develop cardiomyopathy that varies from slowly progressive to fulminant. This variability correlates with the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineage. To confirm that mtDNA variants can modulate the expressivity of nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded diseases, we combined in mice the nDNA Slc25a4−/− null mutation with a homoplasmic mtDNA ND6P25L or COIV421A variant. The ND6P25L variant significantly increased the severity of cardiomyopathy while the COIV421A variant was phenotypically neutral. The adverse Slc25a4−/− and ND6P25L combination was associated with impaired mitochondrial complex I activity, increased oxidative damage, decreased l-Opa1, altered mitochondrial morphology, sensitization of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, augmented somatic mtDNA mutation levels, and shortened lifespan. The strikingly different phenotypic effects of these mild mtDNA variants demonstrate that mtDNA can be an important modulator of autosomal disease.

Abstract: Summary
Subcellular localization is a main determinant of protein function; however, a global view of cellular proteome organization remains relatively unexplored. We have developed a robust mass spectrometry-based analysis pipeline to generate a proteome-wide view of subcellular localization for proteins mapping to 12,418 individual genes across five cell lines. Based on more than 83,000 unique classifications and correlation profiling, we investigate the effect of alternative splicing and protein domains on localization, complex member co-localization, cell-type-specific localization, as well as protein relocalization after growth factor inhibition. Our analysis provides information about the cellular architecture and complexity of the spatial organization of the proteome; we show that the majority of proteins have a single main subcellular location, that alternative splicing rarely affects subcellular location, and that cell types are best distinguished by expression of proteins exposed to the surrounding environment.

Abstract: Summary
Displacement loops (D-loops) are pivotal intermediates of homologous recombination (HR), a universal DNA double strand break (DSB) repair pathway. We developed a versatile assay for the physical detection of D-loops in vivo, which enabled studying the kinetics of their formation and defining the activities controlling their metabolism. Nascent D-loops are detected within 2 h of DSB formation and extended in a delayed fashion in a genetic system designed to preclude downstream repair steps. The majority of nascent D-loops are disrupted by two pathways: one supported by the Srs2 helicase and the other by the Mph1 helicase and the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 helicase-topoisomerase complex. Both pathways operate without significant overlap and are delineated by the Rad54 paralog Rdh54 in an ATPase-independent fashion. This study uncovers a layer of quality control of HR relying on nascent D-loop dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Parsing diverse nerve cells into biological types is necessary for understanding neural circuit organization. Morphology is an intuitive criterion for neuronal classification and a proxy of connectivity, but morphological diversity and variability often preclude resolving the granularity of neuron types. Combining genetic labeling with high-resolution, large-volume light microscopy, we established a single neuron anatomy platform that resolves, registers, and quantifies complete neuron morphologies in the mouse brain. We discovered that cortical axo-axonic cells (AACs), a cardinal GABAergic interneuron type that controls pyramidal neuron (PyN) spiking at axon initial segments, consist of multiple subtypes distinguished by highly laminar-specific soma position and dendritic and axonal arborization patterns. Whereas the laminar arrangements of AAC dendrites reflect differential recruitment by input streams, the laminar distribution and local geometry of AAC axons enable differential innervation of PyN ensembles. This platform will facilitate genetically targeted, high-resolution, and scalable single neuron anatomy in the mouse brain.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to phosphodiester bond formation, RNA polymerase II has an RNA endonuclease activity, stimulated by TFIIS, which rescues complexes that have arrested and backtracked. How TFIIS affects transcription under normal conditions is poorly understood. We identified backtracking sites in human cells using a dominant-negative TFIIS (TFIISDN) that inhibits RNA cleavage and stabilizes backtracked complexes. Backtracking is most frequent within 2 kb of start sites, consistent with slow elongation early in transcription, and in 3′ flanking regions where termination is enhanced by TFIISDN, suggesting that backtracked pol II is a favorable substrate for termination. Rescue from backtracking by RNA cleavage also promotes escape from 5′ pause sites, prevents premature termination of long transcripts, and enhances activation of stress-inducible genes. TFIISDN slowed elongation rates genome-wide by half, suggesting that rescue of backtracked pol II by TFIIS is a major stimulus of elongation under normal conditions.

Abstract: CD4 T cells differentiate into RORγt/IL-17A-expressing cells in the small intestine following colonization by segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB). However, it remains unclear whether SFB-specific CD4 T cells can differentiate directly from naïve precursors, and whether their effector differentiation is solely directed towards the Th17 lineage. In this study, we used adoptive T cell transfer experiments and showed that naïve CD4 T cells can migrate to the small intestinal lamina propria (sLP) and differentiate into effector T cells that synthesize IL-17A in response to SFB colonization. Using single cell RT-PCR analysis, we showed that the progenies of SFB responding T cells are not uniform but composed of transcriptionally divergent populations including Th1, Th17 and follicular helper T cells. We further confirmed this finding using in vitro culture of SFB specific intestinal CD4 T cells in the presence of cognate antigens, which also generated heterogeneous population with similar features. Collectively, these findings indicate that a single species of intestinal bacteria can generate a divergent population of antigen-specific effector CD4 T cells, rather than it provides a cytokine milieu for the development of a particular effector T cell subset.

Abstract: Summary
The control of cell position and division act in concert to dictate multicellular organization in tissues and organs. How these processes shape global order and molecular movement across organs is an outstanding problem in biology. Using live 3D imaging and computational analyses, we extracted networks capturing cellular connectivity dynamics across the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem (SAM) and topologically analyzed the local and global properties of cellular architecture. Locally generated cell division rules lead to the emergence of global tissue-scale organization of the SAM, facilitating robust global communication. Cells that lie upon more shorter paths have an increased propensity to divide, with division plane placement acting to limit the number of shortest paths their daughter cells lie upon. Cell shape heterogeneity and global cellular organization requires KATANIN, providing a multiscale link between cell geometry, mechanical cell-cell interactions, and global tissue order.

Abstract: Summary
Intron retention (IR) has emerged as an important mechanism of gene expression control, but the factors controlling IR events remain poorly understood. We observed consistent IR in one intron of the Irf7 gene and identified BUD13 as an RNA-binding protein that acts at this intron to increase the amount of successful splicing. Deficiency in BUD13 was associated with increased IR, decreased mature Irf7 transcript and protein levels, and consequently a dampened type I interferon response, which compromised the ability of BUD13-deficient macrophages to withstand vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. Global analysis of BUD13 knockdown and BUD13 cross-linking to RNA revealed a subset of introns that share many characteristics with the one found in Irf7 and are spliced in a BUD13-dependent manner. Deficiency of BUD13 led to decreased mature transcript from genes containing such introns. Thus, by acting as an antagonist to IR, BUD13 facilitates the expression of genes at which IR occurs.

Abstract: Summary
mTORC1 and GSK3 play critical roles in early stages of (macro)autophagy, but how they regulate late steps of autophagy remains poorly understood. Here we show that mTORC1 and GSK3-TIP60 signaling converge to modulate autophagosome maturation through Pacer, an autophagy regulator that was identified in our recent study. Hepatocyte-specific Pacer knockout in mice results in impaired autophagy flux, glycogen and lipid accumulation, and liver fibrosis. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 phosphorylates Pacer at serine157 to disrupt the association of Pacer with Stx17 and the HOPS complex and thus abolishes Pacer-mediated autophagosome maturation. Importantly, dephosphorylation of Pacer under nutrient-deprived conditions promotes TIP60-mediated Pacer acetylation, which facilitates HOPS complex recruitment and is required for autophagosome maturation and lipid droplet clearance. This work not only identifies Pacer as a regulator in hepatic autophagy and liver homeostasis in vivo but also reveals a signal integration mechanism involved in late stages of autophagy and lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The BRCA1-BRCA2-RAD51 axis is essential for homologous recombination repair (HRR) and is frequently disrupted in breast cancers. PARP inhibitors (PARPis) are used clinically to treat BRCA-mutated breast tumors. Using a genetic screen, we identified EMI1 as a modulator of PARPi sensitivity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. This function requires the F-box domain of EMI1, through which EMI1 assembles a canonical SCF ubiquitin ligase complex that constitutively targets RAD51 for degradation. In response to genotoxic stress, CHK1-mediated phosphorylation of RAD51 counteracts EMI1-dependent degradation by enhancing RAD51’s affinity for BRCA2, leading to RAD51 accumulation. Inhibition of RAD51 degradation restores HRR in BRCA1-depleted cells. Human breast cancer samples display an inverse correlation between EMI1 and RAD51 protein levels. A subset of BRCA1-deficient TNBC cells develop resistance to PARPi by downregulating EMI1 and restoring RAD51-dependent HRR. Notably, reconstitution of EMI1 expression reestablishes PARPi sensitivity both in cellular systems and in an orthotopic mouse model.

Abstract: Summary
The post-translational modification of key residues at the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAP2-CTD) coordinates transcription, splicing, and RNA processing by modulating its capacity to act as a landing platform for a variety of protein complexes. Here, we identify a new modification at the CTD, the deimination of arginine and its conversion to citrulline by peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PADI2), an enzyme that has been associated with several diseases, including cancer. We show that, among PADI family members, only PADI2 citrullinates R1810 (Cit1810) at repeat 31 of the CTD. Depletion of PADI2 or loss of R1810 results in accumulation of RNAP2 at transcription start sites, reduced gene expression, and inhibition of cell proliferation. Cit1810 is needed for interaction with the P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) kinase complex and for its recruitment to chromatin. In this way, CTD-Cit1810 favors RNAP2 pause release and efficient transcription in breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Steroid hormones are important signaling molecules that regulate growth and drive the development of many cancers. These factors act as long-range signals that systemically regulate the growth of the entire organism, whereas the Hippo/Warts tumor-suppressor pathway acts locally to limit organ growth. We show here that autophagy, a pathway that mediates the degradation of cellular components, also controls steroid production. This process is regulated by Warts (in mammals, LATS1/2) signaling, via its effector microRNA bantam, in response to nutrients. Specifically, autophagy-mediated mobilization and trafficking of the steroid precursor cholesterol from intracellular stores controls the production of the Drosophila steroid ecdysone. Furthermore, we also show that bantam regulates this process via the ecdysone receptor and Tor signaling, identifying pathways through which bantam regulates autophagy and growth. The Warts pathway thus promotes nutrient-dependent systemic growth during development by autophagy-dependent steroid hormone regulation (ASHR). These findings uncover an autophagic trafficking mechanism that regulates steroid production.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell gene expression reveals the diversity within a differentiated cell type. Often, cells of the same type show a continuum of gene-expression patterns. The origin of such continuum gene-expression patterns is unclear. To address this, we develop a theory to understand how a continuum provides division of labor in a tissue in which cells collectively contribute to several tasks. We find that a continuum is optimal when there are spatial gradients in the tissue that affect the performance in each task. The continuum is bounded inside a polyhedron whose vertices are expression profiles optimal at each task. We test this using single-cell gene expression for intestinal villi and liver hepatocytes, which form a curved 1D trajectory and a full 3D tetrahedron in gene-expression space, respectively. We infer the tasks for both cell types and characterize the spatial zonation of the task-specialist cells. This approach can be generally applied to other tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting both upper and lower motor neurons (MNs). To date, its underlying mechanisms have yet to be clarified completely, and there are no truly effective treatments. Here, we show that MAP4K4, a MAP kinase family member, regulates MN death, with its suppression not only promoting survival but preventing neurite degeneration and decreasing mutant SOD1 levels through autophagy activation. Moreover, we report that MAP4K4 signaling specifically modulates MN viability via phosphorylated JNK3 and activation of the canonical c-Jun apoptotic pathway. Finally, we show the feasibility of MAP4K4 as a drug target by using an available MAP4K4-specific inhibitor, which improves survival of ESC and/or iPSC-derived MNs and MNs cultured from mouse spinal cords. In summary, our studies highlight a MAP4K4-initiated signaling cascade that induces MN degeneration, shedding light on the mechanism underlying MN degeneration and providing a druggable target for ALS therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Calcium is a universal signal in all eukaryotes, but the mechanism for encoding calcium signatures remains largely unknown. Calcium oscillations control pollen tube growth and fertilization in flowering plants, serving as a model for dissecting the molecular machines that mediate calcium fluctuations. We report that pollen-tube-specific cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGC18, CNGC8, and CNGC7) together with calmodulin 2 (CaM2) constitute a molecular switch that either opens or closes the calcium channel depending on cellular calcium levels. Under low calcium, calcium-free calmodulin 2 (Apo-CaM2) interacts with CNGC18-CNGC8 complex, leading to activation of the influx channel and consequently increasing cytosolic calcium levels. Calcium-bound CaM2 dissociates from CNGC18/8 heterotetramer, closing the channel and initiating a downturn of cellular calcium levels. We further reconstituted the calcium oscillator in HEK293 cells, supporting the model that Ca2+-CaM-dependent regulation of CNGC channel activity provides an auto-regulatory feedback mechanism for calcium oscillations during pollen tube growth.

Abstract: Summary
Increased susceptibility of circadian clock mutant mice to metabolic diseases has led to the idea that a molecular clock is necessary for metabolic homeostasis. However, these mice often lack a normal feeding-fasting cycle. We tested whether time-restricted feeding (TRF) could prevent obesity and metabolic syndrome in whole-body Cry1;Cry2 and in liver-specific Bmal1 and Rev-erbα/β knockout mice. When provided access to food ad libitum, these mice rapidly gained weight and showed genotype-specific metabolic defects. However, when fed the same diet under TRF (food access restricted to 10 hr during the dark phase) they were protected from excessive weight gain and metabolic diseases. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses showed that TRF reduced the accumulation of hepatic lipids and enhanced cellular defenses against metabolic stress. These results suggest that the circadian clock maintains metabolic homeostasis by sustaining daily rhythms in feeding and fasting and by maintaining balance between nutrient and cellular stress responses.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is a heterogeneous phenotype that is crudely measured by body mass index (BMI). There is a need for a more precise yet portable method of phenotyping and categorizing risk in large numbers of people with obesity to advance clinical care and drug development. Here, we used non-targeted metabolomics and whole-genome sequencing to identify metabolic and genetic signatures of obesity. We find that obesity results in profound perturbation of the metabolome; nearly a third of the assayed metabolites associated with changes in BMI. A metabolome signature identifies the healthy obese and lean individuals with abnormal metabolomes—these groups differ in health outcomes and underlying genetic risk. Specifically, an abnormal metabolome associated with a 2- to 5-fold increase in cardiovascular events when comparing individuals who were matched for BMI but had opposing metabolome signatures. Because metabolome profiling identifies clinically meaningful heterogeneity in obesity, this approach could help select patients for clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) develops after years of prediabetes during which high glucose (glucotoxicity) impairs insulin secretion. We report that the ATP-conducting mitochondrial outer membrane voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1) is upregulated in islets from T2D and non-diabetic organ donors under glucotoxic conditions. This is caused by a glucotoxicity-induced transcriptional program, triggered during years of prediabetes with suboptimal blood glucose control. Metformin counteracts VDAC1 induction. VDAC1 overexpression causes its mistargeting to the plasma membrane of the insulin-secreting β cells with loss of the crucial metabolic coupling factor ATP. VDAC1 antibodies and inhibitors prevent ATP loss. Through direct inhibition of VDAC1 conductance, metformin, like specific VDAC1 inhibitors and antibodies, restores the impaired generation of ATP and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in T2D islets. Treatment of db/db mice with VDAC1 inhibitor prevents hyperglycemia, and maintains normal glucose tolerance and physiological regulation of insulin secretion. Thus, β cell function is preserved by targeting the novel diabetes executer protein VDAC1.

Abstract: Summary
R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures that form during transcription, especially over unmethylated CpG-rich promoters of active genes. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), CpG-rich developmental regulator genes are repressed by the Polycomb complexes PRC1 and PRC2. Here, we show that R-loops form at a subset of Polycomb target genes, and we investigate their contribution to Polycomb repression. At R-loop-positive genes, R-loop removal leads to decreased PRC1 and PRC2 recruitment and Pol II activation into a productive elongation state, accompanied by gene derepression at nascent and processed transcript levels. Stable removal of PRC2 derepresses R-loop-negative genes, as expected, but does not affect R-loops, PRC1 recruitment, or transcriptional repression of R-loop-positive genes. Our results highlight that Polycomb repression does not occur via one mechanism but consists of different layers of repression, some of which are gene specific. We uncover that one such mechanism is mediated by an interplay between R-loops and RING1B recruitment.

Abstract: The ultrastructure of the spermatozoon of Allopodocotyle tunisiensis (Digenea, Opecoelidae), an intestinal parasite of Solea aegyptiaca (Teleostei, Soleidae), is described by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The mature spermatozoon is a filiform cell that exhibits two axonemes of different length with the 9+'1' pattern of trepaxonematan Platyhelminthes. In the anterior spermatozoon extremity, cortical microtubules are absent. They appear after the disappearance of an anterior electron-dense material, being initially in a continuous and submembranous layer. They surround only partially the sperm cell. Later, these cortical microtubules are distributed into two bundles. Additionally, the spermatozoon of A. tunisiensis shows two mitochondria, a nucleus, an external ornamentation of the plasma membrane, spine-like bodies, and a large amount of glycogen granules. According to the location of the external ornamentation, A. tunisiensis presents a Quilichini et al.'s type 2 spermatozoon. With respect to the posterior extremity, the sperm cell of A. tunisiensis corresponds to the Quilichini et al.'s opecoelid type. The morphology of the first mitochondrion with a U-shaped posterior extremity is described for the first time in a digenean spermatozoon.

Abstract: Summary
Lipoproteins trapped in arteries drive atherosclerosis. Extravascular low-density lipoprotein undergoes receptor uptake, whereas high-density lipoprotein (HDL) interacts with cells to acquire cholesterol and then recirculates to plasma. We developed photoactivatable apoA-I to understand how HDL passage through tissue is regulated. We focused on skin and arteries of healthy mice versus those with psoriasis, which carries cardiovascular risk in man. Our findings suggest that psoriasis-affected skin lesions program interleukin-17-producing T cells in draining lymph nodes to home to distal skin and later to arteries. There, these cells mediate thickening of the collagenous matrix, such that larger molecules including lipoproteins become entrapped. HDL transit was rescued by depleting CD4+ T cells, neutralizing interleukin-17, or inhibiting lysyl oxidase that crosslinks collagen. Experimental psoriasis also increased vascular stiffness and atherosclerosis via this common pathway. Thus, interleukin-17 can reduce lipoprotein trafficking and increase vascular stiffness by, at least in part, remodeling collagen.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cell plasticity facilitates the development of therapy resistance and malignant progression. De-differentiation processes, such as an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), are known to enhance cellular plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that cancer cell plasticity can be exploited therapeutically by forcing the trans-differentiation of EMT-derived breast cancer cells into post-mitotic and functional adipocytes. Delineation of the molecular pathways underlying such trans-differentiation has motivated a combination therapy with MEK inhibitors and the anti-diabetic drug Rosiglitazone in various mouse models of murine and human breast cancer in vivo. This combination therapy provokes the conversion of invasive and disseminating cancer cells into post-mitotic adipocytes leading to the repression of primary tumor invasion and metastasis formation.

Abstract: Background and Objective
In the field of cartilage repair, use of two or more cell populations such as mesenchymal stem cells with chondrocytes in an in-vitro co-culture synergistic environment has been attempted to evade limitations of monoculture systems and promote/induce chondrogenesis. Articular cartilage-derived chondroprogenitors (CPs), considered to have stem-cell like characteristics have been proposed as a potential contender for neocartilage development. Our objective was to assess whether co-cultures using different ratios of chondrocytes(C) and CPs would demonstrate better results in terms of growth kinetics, surface marker expression, chondrogenic potential, tendency for hypertrophy and glycosaminoglycan deposition than monocultures.
Study design
Human chondrocytes and CPs (fibronectin adhesion assay) from the same cartilage source were isolated. Passage 2 cells were subjected to monolayer/pellet cultures and were grown as monocultures and cocultures at the following percentage ratios(C:CP) 80:20, 65:35, 50:50, 35:65 and 20:80.
Results
Analysis of data acquired from population doubling, flow cytometry, RT-PCR and Safranin O uptake demonstrated similar results in all monoculture and co-culture groups with no significant inter-group variation, even when reported specific markers of identification (CD54 and CD44:chondrocyte markers) and isolation (CD29 and CD49e: forming heterodimeric fibronectin receptor for CP sorting) were examined.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study suggests the need for improved sorting techniques based on a characteristic differentiating biomarker for selection of cells which are true representatives of CPs possessing properties of enhanced chondrogenesis and reduced hypertrophy.

Abstract: Melanomacrophage centres (MMCs) are distinct aggregations of pigment-containing cells in internal organs of fish, amphibians and reptiles. Although MMCs are commonly used as biomarkers for anthropogenic exposure in many environmental monitoring programs, a substantial knowledge on characteristics of MMCs is required prior to the assessment of MMC responses. The present study was the first to determine the 3D structure of splenic MMCs of a fish from a number of consecutive histology sections by use of the Fiji and AutoCad software. Most splenic MMCs of shorthorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus scorpius) had spherical shape and limited variation in size (maximum diameter). We confirmed the close relationship between MMCs and blood vessels in spleen of shorthorn sculpins as 97% of investigated MMCs (60 whole MMCs over 510 μm thickness of the samples) were closely associated with splenic blood capillaries (mainly ellipsoids) at least once in a set of consecutive sections. In this paper, we describe variations in morphology, density, size, area, distribution, pigments and response to pathogens of MMC populations from different organs (spleen, kidney, liver, pancreas and gills). Additionally, we provide evidence suggesting the presence and dominance of pheomelanin in MMCs of shorthorn sculpins.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise promotes adipose remodeling and improves obesity-induced metabolic disorders through mechanisms that remain obscure. Here, we identify the FGF21 signaling in adipose tissues as an obligatory molecular transducer of exercise conferring its metabolic benefits in mice. Long-term high fat diet-fed obese mice exhibit compromised effects of exogenous FGF21 on alleviation of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia, accompanied with markedly reduced expression of FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1) and β-Klotho (KLB) in adipose tissues. These impairments in obese mice are reversed by treadmill exercise. Mice lacking adipose KLB are refractory to exercise-induced alleviation of insulin resistance, glucose dysregulation, and ectopic lipid accumulation due to diminished adiponectin production, excessive fatty acid release, and enhanced adipose inflammation. Mechanistically, exercise induces the adipose expression of FGFR1 and KLB via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-mediated transcriptional activation. Thus, exercise sensitizes FGF21 actions in adipose tissues, which in turn sends humoral signals to coordinate multi-organ crosstalk for maintaining metabolic homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Altered DNA methylation plays an important role in the onset and progression of kidney disease. However, little is known about how the changes arise in disease states. Here, we report that KAT5-mediated DNA damage repair is essential for the maintenance of kidney podocytes and is associated with DNA methylation status. Podocyte-specific KAT5-knockout mice develop severe albuminuria with increased DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), increased DNA methylation of the nephrin promoter region, and decreased nephrin expression. Podocyte KAT5 expression is decreased, whereas DNA DSBs and DNA methylation are increased in diabetic nephropathy; moreover, KAT5 restoration by gene transfer attenuates albuminuria. Furthermore, KAT5 decreases DNA DSBs and DNA methylation at the same nephrin promoter region, which indicates that KAT5-mediated DNA repair may be related to DNA methylation status. These results suggest a concept in which an environment of DNA damage repair, which occurs with decreased KAT5, may affect DNA methylation status.

Abstract: Summary
Mitophagy, a mitochondrial quality control process for eliminating dysfunctional mitochondria, can be induced by a response of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial division. However, the coordination between MMP and mitochondrial division for selecting the damaged portion of the mitochondrial network is less understood. Here, we found that MMP is reduced focally at a fission site by the Drp1 recruitment, which is initiated by the interaction of Drp1 with mitochondrial zinc transporter Zip1 and Zn2+ entry through the Zip1-MCU complex. After division, healthy mitochondria restore MMP levels and participate in the fusion-fission cycle again, but mitochondria that fail to restore MMP undergo mitophagy. Thus, interfering with the interaction between Drp1 and Zip1 blocks the reduction of MMP and the subsequent mitophagic selection of damaged mitochondria. These results suggest that Drp1-dependent fission provides selective pressure for eliminating “bad sectors” in the mitochondrial network, serving as a mitochondrial quality surveillance system.

Abstract: Rat melanotrophs express several types of voltage-gated and ligand-gated calcium channels, although mechanisms involved in the maintenance of the resting intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) remain unknown. We analyzed mechanisms regulating resting [Ca2+]i in dissociated rat melanotrophs by Ca2+-imaging and patch-clamp techniques. Treatment with antagonists of L-type, but not N- or P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) as well as removal of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in a rapid and reversible decrease in [Ca2+]i, indicating constitutive Ca2+ influx through L-type VGCCs. Reduction of extracellular Na+ concentration (replacement with NMDG+) similarly decreased resting [Ca2+]i. When cells were champed at –80 mV, decrease in the extracellular Na+ resulted in a positive shift of the holding current. In cell-attached voltage-clamp and whole-cell current-clamp configurations, the reduction of extracellular Na+ caused hyperpolarisation. The holding current shifted in negative direction when extracellular K+ concentration was increased from 5 mM to 50 mM in the presence of K+ channel blockers, Ba2+ and TEA, indicating cation nature of persistent conductance. RT-PCR analyses of pars intermedia tissues detected mRNAs of TRPV1, TRPV4, TRPC6, and TRPM3-5. The TRPV channel blocker, ruthenium red, shifted the holding current in positive direction, and significantly decreased the resting [Ca2+]i. These results indicate operation of a constitutive cation conductance sensitive to ruthenium red, which regulates resting membrane potential and [Ca2+]i in rat melanotrophs.

Abstract: Summary
The introduction of azole heterocycles into a peptide backbone is the principal step in the biosynthesis of numerous compounds with therapeutic potential. One of them is microcin B17, a bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor whose activity depends on the conversion of selected serine and cysteine residues of the precursor peptide to oxazoles and thiazoles by the McbBCD synthetase complex. Crystal structures of McbBCD reveal an octameric B4C2D2 complex with two bound substrate peptides. Each McbB dimer clamps the N-terminal recognition sequence, while the C-terminal heterocycle of the modified peptide is trapped in the active site of McbC. The McbD and McbC active sites are distant from each other, which necessitates alternate shuttling of the peptide substrate between them, while remaining tethered to the McbB dimer. An atomic-level view of the azole synthetase is a starting point for deeper understanding and control of biosynthesis of a large group of ribosomally synthesized natural products.

Abstract: Summary
HIV persists in long-lived infected cells that are not affected by antiretroviral treatment. These HIV reservoirs are mainly located in CD4+ T cells, but their distribution is variable in the different subsets. Susceptibility to HIV-1 increases with CD4+ T cell differentiation. We evaluated whether the metabolic programming that supports the differentiation and function of CD4+ T cells affected their susceptibility to HIV-1. We found that differences in HIV-1 susceptibility between naive and more differentiated subsets were associated with the metabolic activity of the cells. Indeed, HIV-1 selectively infected CD4+ T cells with high oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, independent of their activation phenotype. Moreover, partial inhibition of glycolysis (1) impaired HIV-1 infection in vitro in all CD4+ T cell subsets, (2) decreased the viability of preinfected cells, and (3) precluded HIV-1 amplification in cells from HIV-infected individuals. Our results elucidate the link between cell metabolism and HIV-1 infection and identify a vulnerability in tackling HIV reservoirs.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription initiation requires opening of promoter DNA in the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pre-initiation complex (PIC), but it remains unclear how this is achieved. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) structure of a yeast PIC that contains underwound, distorted promoter DNA in the closed Pol II cleft. The DNA duplex axis is offset at the upstream edge of the initially melted DNA region (IMR) where DNA opening begins. Unstable IMRs are found in a subset of yeast promoters that we show can still initiate transcription after depletion of the transcription factor (TF) IIH (TFIIH) translocase Ssl2 (XPB in human) from the nucleus in vivo. PIC-induced DNA distortions may thus prime the IMR for melting and may explain how unstable IMRs that are predicted in promoters of Pol I and Pol III can open spontaneously. These results suggest that DNA distortion in the polymerase cleft is a general mechanism that contributes to promoter opening.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the neural framework behind appetite control is fundamental to developing effective therapies to combat the obesity epidemic. The paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) is critical for appetite regulation, yet, the real-time, physiological response properties of PVH neurons to nutrients are unknown. Using a combination of fiber photometry, electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and neural manipulation strategies, we determined the population dynamics of four molecularly delineated PVH subsets implicated in feeding behavior: glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (PVHGlp1r), melanocortin-4 receptor (PVHMc4r), oxytocin (PVHOxt), and corticotropin-releasing hormone (PVHCrh). We identified both calorie- and state-dependent sustained activity increases and decreases in PVHGlp1r and PVHCrh populations, respectively, while observing transient bulk changes of PVHMc4r, but no response in PVHOxt, neurons to food. Furthermore, we highlight the role of PVHGlp1r neurons in orchestrating acute feeding behavior, independent of the anti-obesity drug liraglutide, and demonstrate the indispensability of PVHGlp1r and PVHMc4r, but not PVHOxt or PVHCrh neurons, in body weight maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Biallelic germline mutations affecting NTHL1 predispose carriers to adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer, but the complete phenotype is unknown. We describe 29 individuals carrying biallelic germline NTHL1 mutations from 17 families, of which 26 developed one (n = 10) or multiple (n = 16) malignancies in 14 different tissues. An unexpected high breast cancer incidence was observed in female carriers (60%). Mutational signature analysis of 14 tumors from 7 organs revealed that NTHL1 deficiency underlies the main mutational process in all but one of the tumors (93%). These results reveal NTHL1 as a multi-tumor predisposition gene with a high lifetime risk for extracolonic cancers and a typical mutational signature observed across tumor types, which can assist in the recognition of this syndrome.
