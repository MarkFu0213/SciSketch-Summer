Abstract: Different from the nucleolus-specific localization in some types of cancer cells, ribosomal L1 domain-containing protein 1 (RSL1D1) distributes throughout the nucleus in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. RSL1D1 directly interacts with DNA binding domain (aa 93–292) of wild-type p53 (p53-WT) and thereby recruits p53 to HDM2. The ensuing formation of RSL1D1/HDM2/p53 complex enhances p53 ubiquitination and decreases the protein level of p53 in CRC cells. In this study, we investigated the interaction between RSL1D1 and mutant p53 proteins. We first corroborated that aa 93–224 of p53 is a more precise domain for RSL1D1 binding and mutation in either aa 93–224 or aa 225–292 domain of p53 affects RSL1D1-p53 interaction. R175H mutated p53 does not interact with RSL1D1, whereas R273H mutated p53 still can bind to RSL1D1 but showing a remarkably decreased affinity than p53-WT. Although p53-R273H retains a weakened binding affinity with RSL1D1, it can hardly be recruited to HDM2 by RSL1D1 in HCT116 CRC cells. Accordingly, RSL1D1 loses its capacity to negatively regulate either R175H or R273H p53 mutant via directly interaction in HCT116 cells, thereby facilitating p53 mutants to accumulate and gain oncogenic function. Our findings help explain why mutant p53 proteins are more stable than p53-WT in CRC cells.

Abstract: The Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF- β1) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is the major cytokine that acts as a mediator of tumor-stroma crosstalk, which in fact has a dual role in either promoting or suppressing tumor development. The cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major cell types in the TME, and the interaction with most of the epithelial cancers is the prime reason for cancer survival. However, the molecular mechanisms, associated with the TGF- β1 induced tumor promotion through tumor-CAF crosstalk are not well understood. In the Reverse Warburg effect, CAFs feed the adjacent cancer cells by lactate produced during the aerobic glycolysis. We hypothesized that the monocarboxylate transporter, MCT4 which is implicated in lactate efflux from the CAFs, must be overexpressed in the CAFs. Contextually, to explore the role of TGF- β1 in the hypoxia-induced autophagy in CAFs, we treated CoCl2 and external TGF- β1 to the human dermal fibroblasts and L929 murine fibroblasts. We demonstrated that hypoxia accelerated the TGF- β1 signaling and subsequent transformation of normal fibroblasts to CAFs. Moreover, we elucidated that synergistic induction of autophagy by hypoxia and TGF- β1 upregulate the aerobic glycolysis and MCT4 expression in CAFs. Furthermore, we showed a positive correlation between glucose consumption and MCT4 expression in the CAFs. Autophagy was also found to be involved in the EMT in hypoxic CAFs. Collectively, these findings reveal the unappreciated role of autophagy in TME, which enhances the CAF transformation and that promotes tumor migration and metastasis via the reverse Warburg effect.

Abstract: Summary
Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is emerging as global problem with unknown molecular drivers. Using a digital epidemiology approach, we recruited 8,077 individuals to the cohort study for digital health research in Germany (DigiHero) to respond to a basic questionnaire followed by a PASC-focused survey and blood sampling. We report the first 318 participants, the majority thereof after mild infections. Of those, 67.8% report PASC, predominantly consisting of fatigue, dyspnea, and concentration deficit, which persists in 60% over the mean 8-month follow-up period and resolves independently of post-infection vaccination. PASC is not associated with autoantibodies, but with elevated IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF plasma levels, which we confirm in a validation cohort with 333 additional participants and a longer time from infection of 10 months. Blood profiling and single-cell data from early infection suggest the induction of these cytokines in COVID-19 lung pro-inflammatory macrophages creating a self-sustaining feedback loop.

Abstract: Radioresistance currently poses a significant challenge to successful disease control of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We previously uncovered that annexin A3 (ANXA3), a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein, is underexpressed in radioresistant NPC cells and mouse xenografts. This study aims to further unravel the mechanistic basis underlying ANXA3-mediated radioresistance in NPC. We show that either innate ANXA3 downregulation or short hairpin RNA(shRNA)-based knockdown of ANXA3 confers resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) in NPC both in vitro and in mouse xenograft models in vivo, whereas radiosensitization was observed when ANXA3 was ectopically expressed. Mechanistically, ANXA3 knockdown dramatically enhances IR-induced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, leading to increased post-IR phosphorylation of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) concomitant with markedly accelerated DNA DSB repair. In addition, pretreatment with cetuximab efficiently abrogated the radioresistant phenotype of ANXA3-low cells as well as the ANXA3 knockdown-induced post-IR EGFR nuclear accumulation, suggesting that EGFR is an essential mediator for ANXA3 depletion-mediated radioprotection in NPC. Collectively, this work reveals for the first time a critical role of ANXA3 in radiation survival and DNA repair mechanism of NPC and provides mechanistic evidence to support ANXA3 as a potential therapeutic target to improve radiocurability for NPC.

Abstract: Summary
The elimination of amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers is a promising strategy for therapeutic drug development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD mouse models that develop Aβ pathology have been used to demonstrate in vivo efficacy of compounds that later failed in clinical development. Here, we analyze the concentration and size distribution of Aβ oligomers in different transgenic mouse models of AD and in human brain samples by surface-based fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (sFIDA), a highly sensitive method for detecting and quantitating protein aggregates. We demonstrate dose- and time-dependent oligomer elimination by the compound RD2 in mouse and human AD brain homogenates as sources of native Aβ oligomers. Such ex vivo target engagement analyses with mouse- and human-brain-derived oligomers have the potential to enhance the translational value from pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies to clinical trials.

Abstract: Oxidative stress is considered a driving event in the damage to inner hair cell (IHC) synapses. Mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is an important regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, the effect of SIRT3 on IHC synapses remains elusive. In this study, we treated cochlear basilar membrane (CBM) with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to establish an oxidative stress model in vitro. The H2O2-induced CBM exhibited decreased the number of IHC synapses with low levels of ATP and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, H2O2-induced CBM showed markedly reduced levels of forkhead box protein O 3a (FOXO3a), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), thereby increasing ROS generation. SIRT3 overexpression via administrating nicotinamide riboside in the H2O2-induced CBM protected IHC synapses against oxidative stress and inhibited hair cell apoptosis. We further demonstrated that SIRT3 overexpression led to upregulation of IDH2, and hypoacetylation of several proteins, such as FOXO3a and SOD2, which in turn reduced the levels of ROS and improved mitochondrial function. Collectively, these findings reveal that overexpressing SIRT3 may be a potential therapeutic approach for damaged IHC synapses induced by oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor regulatory T cells (CAR Tregs) is a promising way to prevent allograft loss without the morbidity associated with current therapies. Non-human primates (NHPs) are a clinically relevant model to develop transplant regimens, but manufacturing and engraftment of NHP CAR Tregs have not been demonstrated yet. Here, we describe a culture system that massively expands CAR Tregs specific for the Bw6 alloantigen. In vitro, these Tregs suppress in an antigen-specific manner without pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion or cytotoxicity. In vivo, Bw6-specific CAR Tregs preferentially traffic to and persist in bone marrow for at least 1 month. Following transplant of allogeneic Bw6+ islets and autologous CAR Tregs into the bone marrow of diabetic recipients, CAR Tregs traffic to the site of islet transplantation and maintain a phenotype of suppressive Tregs. Our results establish a framework for the optimization of CAR Treg therapy in NHP disease models.

Abstract: Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescents living in regions with low vaccination rates rely on post-infection immunity for protection against re-infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluate humoral and T cell immunity against five variants of concern (VOCs) in mild-COVID-19 convalescents at 12 months after infection with ancestral virus. In this cohort, ancestral, receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody and circulating memory B cell levels are conserved in most individuals, and yet serum neutralization against live B.1.1.529 (Omicron) is completely abrogated and significantly reduced for other VOCs. Likewise, ancestral SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell frequencies are maintained in >50% of convalescents, but the cytokine response in these cells to mutated spike epitopes corresponding to B.1.1.529 and B.1.351 (Beta) VOCs were impaired. These results indicate that increased antigen variability in VOCs impairs humoral and spike-specific T cell immunity post-infection, strongly suggesting that COVID-19 convalescents are vulnerable and at risk of re-infection with VOCs, thus stressing the importance of vaccination programs.

Abstract: Summary
Serological markers are a promising tool for surveillance and targeted interventions for Plasmodium vivax malaria. P. vivax is closely related to the zoonotic parasite P. knowlesi, which also infects humans. P. vivax and P. knowlesi are co-endemic across much of South East Asia, making it important to design serological markers that minimize cross-reactivity in this region. To determine the degree of IgG cross-reactivity against a panel of P. vivax serological markers, we assayed samples from human patients with P. knowlesi malaria. IgG antibody reactivity is high against P. vivax proteins with high sequence identity with their P. knowlesi ortholog. IgG reactivity peaks at 7 days post-P. knowlesi infection and is short-lived, with minimal responses 1 year post-infection. We designed a panel of eight P. vivax proteins with low levels of cross-reactivity with P. knowlesi. This panel can accurately classify recent P. vivax infections while reducing misclassification of recent P. knowlesi infections.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal microbiome releases a plethora of small molecules. Here, we show that the Ruminococcaceae metabolite isoamylamine (IAA) is enriched in aged mice and elderly people, whereas Ruminococcaceae phages, belonging to the Myoviridae family, are reduced. Young mice orally administered IAA show cognitive decline, whereas Myoviridae phage administration reduces IAA levels. Mechanistically, IAA promotes apoptosis of microglial cells by recruiting the transcriptional regulator p53 to the S100A8 promoter region. Specifically, IAA recognizes and binds the S100A8 promoter region to facilitate the unwinding of its self-complementary hairpin structure, thereby subsequently enabling p53 to access the S100A8 promoter and enhance S100A8 expression. Thus, our findings provide evidence that small molecules released from the gut microbiome can directly bind genomic DNA and act as transcriptional coregulators by recruiting transcription factors. These findings further unveil a molecular mechanism that connects gut metabolism to gene expression in the brain with implications for disease development.

Abstract: Summary
Prior to initiating symptomatic malaria, a single Plasmodium sporozoite infects a hepatocyte and develops into thousands of merozoites, in part by scavenging host resources, likely delivered by vesicles. Here, we demonstrate that host microtubules (MTs) dynamically reorganize around the developing liver stage (LS) parasite to facilitate vesicular transport to the parasite. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identified host regulators of cytoskeleton organization, vesicle trafficking, and ER/Golgi stress that regulate LS development. Foci of γ-tubulin localized to the parasite periphery; depletion of centromere protein J (CENPJ), a novel regulator identified in the screen, exacerbated this re-localization and increased infection. We demonstrate that the Golgi acts as a non-centrosomal MT organizing center (ncMTOC) by positioning γ-tubulin and stimulating MT nucleation at parasite periphery. Together, these data support a model where the Plasmodium LS recruits host Golgi to form MT-mediated conduits along which host organelles are recruited to PVM and support parasite development.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is a molecular chaperone and central regulator of protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Paramount to this role is Hsp70’s binding to client proteins and co-chaperones to produce distinct complexes, such that understanding the protein–protein interactions (PPIs) of Hsp70 is foundational to describing its function and dysfunction in disease. Mounting evidence suggests that these PPIs include both “canonical” interactions, which are universally conserved, and “non-canonical” (or “secondary”) contacts that seem to have emerged in eukaryotes. These two categories of interactions involve discrete binding surfaces, such that some clients and co-chaperones engage Hsp70 with at least two points of contact. While the contributions of canonical interactions to chaperone function are becoming increasingly clear, it can be challenging to deconvolute the roles of secondary interactions. Here, we review what is known about non-canonical contacts and highlight examples where their contributions have been parsed, giving rise to a model in which Hsp70’s secondary contacts are not simply sites of additional avidity but are necessary and sufficient to impart unique functions. From this perspective, we propose that further exploration of non-canonical contacts will generate important insights into the evolution of Hsp70 systems and inspire new approaches for developing small molecules that tune Hsp70-mediated proteostasis.

Abstract: Purpose
The impairment of the coronary microcirculatory barrier caused by acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is closely related to poor prognosis. Recently, pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF) has been proven to be a promising cardiovascular protective drug. In this study, we demonstrated the protective role of PEDF in endothelial tight junctions (TJs) and the vascular barrier in AMI.
Materials and methods
2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), echocardiography and immunofluorescence staining were used to observe the size of infarcted myocardium area and cardiac function in myocardial tissue, and the distribution of TJ proteins in human coronary endothelial cells (HCAEC). Dextran leakage assay and Transwell were used to assess the extent of vascular and HCAEC leakage. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot were used to detect TJ-related mRNA and protein, and signaling pathway protein expression.
Results
PEDF effectively reduced the infarction area and improved cardiac function in AMI rats, and lowered the leakage in AMI rats’ angiocarpy and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)–treated HCAEC. Furthermore, PEDF upregulated the expression of TJ mRNA and proteins in vivo and vitro. Mechanistically, PEDF inhibited the expression of phosphorylated low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (p-LRP6) and active β-catenin under OGD, thus suppressing the activation of the classical Wnt pathway.
Conclusions
These novel findings demonstrated that PEDF maintained the expression of TJ proteins and endothelial barrier integrity by inhibiting the classical Wnt pathway during AMI.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) secreted exosomes are essential in MM-related complications such as osteolytic bone lesions and renal failure, but their role and underlying mechanism in cardiac complications has not yet been clarified. Here, we investigated the effects of U266 (a MM cell line) exosomes (U266-exo) on regulating the viability, cell cycle, oxidative stress and apoptosis of H9C2 cells and the role of circ-CACNG2 in these effects. We found that U266-exo coculture significantly inhibited viability and promoted apoptosis of H9C2 cells, and serum exosomes of MM patients harbored high level of circ-CACNG2. The clinical data analyses indicated that circ-CACNG2 was an independent prognostic and diagnostic indicator of MM-related cardiac complications. Also, in vitro experiments showed that circ-CACNG2 inhibited viability and promoted apoptosis of H9C2 cells. RIPA, pull-down assays, dual-luciferase reporter assays, and RNA FISH assays revealed that miR-197-3p could bind to circ-CACNG2 and caspase3 directly. Rescue experiments proved that circ-CACNG2 can increase the expression of caspase3 by binding to and decreasing the expression of miR-197-3p. In conclusion, MM-exosomes could inhibit cardiomyocyte viability and promote apoptosis partially through circ-CACNG2/miR-197-3p/caspase3 axis.

Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is the second cause of cancer-related mortality in women. Seizure related 6 homolog like 2 (SEZ6L2), a protein presented on cell surface, is involved in tumor development. It was found to be highly expressed in BC, however, its role in BC remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to explore the role of SEZ6L2 in BC. Firstly, the correlationship between SEZ6L2 expression and the clinic pathological characteristics of patients diagnosed with BC was analyzed. Subsequently, the role of SEZ6L2 was further explored using MTT, transwell invasion, flow cytometry, colony formation and wound healing assays. The result showed that the level of SEZ6L2 was remarkably correlated with the TNM stage, HER-2 status and lymph node metastasis of BC. Knockdown of SEZ6L2 significantly suppressed the proliferation of BC cells and induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. In addition, SEZ6L2 knockdown repressed their migration and invasion. On the contrary, SEZ6L2 overexpression performed the opposite effects. Furthermore, SEZ6L2 also accelerated the in vivo tumorigenesis of BC cells. Additionally, according to bioinformatics resources, we identified upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) as a transcriptional factor which bound to the promoter of SEZ6L2 and positively regulated its transcription. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that SEZ6L2 was transcriptionally regulated by USF1 and was involved in the growth and metastasis of BC cells. Revealing the role of SEZ6L2 in BC provides additional knowledge for the pathogenesis of BC, which may benefit to BC therapy.

Abstract: Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) from human and animal fat have emerged as therapeutic alternatives for damaged tissues. Pre-conditioning of ASCs with hypoxia results in their functional enhancement, which might facilitate the process of healing. However, there is still a critical need for large-scale preclinical studies to reinforce the translation of these findings into clinical practice for humans and in veterinary medicine. Here, we adapted a full-thickness excisional skin wound mouse model to evaluate and compare the effect of pig adipose-derived stem cells (pASCs) cultured under normoxia (pASCs-Nor) or hypoxia (pASCs-Hyp) on the healing process. We show that pASCs-Hyp accelerated re-epithelialization, increased hyaluronic acid (HA) content, and decreased scar elevation index (SEI) during the late stage of healing (day 21). Transplantation of pASCs-Hyp also promoted expression of angiogenic marker VegfA and decreased levels of pro-scarring Tgfβ1. Mice tolerated xenotransplantation of the pASCs with no impact on macrophage (CD68 -positive cell) content. However, wounds treated with pASCs-Hyp exhibited decreased elasticity at the early stage of healing and increased expression of Wnt signaling members including Wnt10a, Wnt11, and β-catenin, which are associated with scar-forming wound repair. In conclusion, pASCs treatment may provide a critical step toward the evaluation of pASCs as therapeutically relevant cells in the context of wound healing.

Abstract: Cholesterol homeostasis plays an important role in the maintenance of normal body functions. CYP27A1 is a key enzyme known to regulate cholesterol homeostasis, which catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to 27-HC and has been implicated in the occurrence and metastasis of various cancer types. The present study aimed to explore the regulatory role of CYP27A1 in the development of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In particular, the effect of CYP27A1 on the proliferation and migration of ccRCC cells was investigated. The construction of a stable 786-O cell line overexpressing CYP27A1/pLVX was mediated by lentiviral infection. The proliferative capacity was assessed using MTT and colony formation. Wound healing assay was used to measure cell migration. Production of intracellular cholesterol and 27-HC was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The LXRs/ABCA1 pathway of cholesterol metabolism regulation was studied by RT-qPCR and Western blotting analysis after cells were treated with stimulation agents of 27-HC or T0901317 and inhibition agents of siRNA or GSK2033. The results revealed that overexpression of CYP27A1 could increase the intracellular production of 27-HC and inhibit the proliferation and migration of 786-O cells. And the treatment of 786-O cells with 27-HC induced a similar effect. CYP27A1/27HC mediated activation of the liver X receptors (LXRs) could up-regulate the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), further resulting in the reduction of intracellular cholesterol contents. All of these findings indicated a regulatory role of CYP27A1 in the proliferation and migration of ccRCC, via activating LXRs/ABCA1 to regulate cholesterol homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccination of cows has elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). In this study, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are isolated from a clade A (KNH1144 and BG505) vaccinated cow using a heterologous clade B antigen (AD8). CD4 binding site (CD4bs) bNAb (MEL-1872) is more potent than a majority of CD4bs bNAbs isolated so far. MEL-1872 mAb with CDRH3 of 57 amino acids shows more potency (geometric mean half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50]: 0.009 μg/mL; breadth: 66%) than VRC01 against clade B viruses (29-fold) and than CHO1-31 against tested clade A viruses (21-fold). It also shows more breadth and potency than NC-Cow1, the only other reported anti-HIV-1 bovine bNAb, which has 60% breadth with geometric mean IC50 of 0.090 μg/mL in this study. Using successive different stable-structured SOSIP trimers in bovines can elicit bNAbs focusing on epitopes ubiquitous across subtypes. Furthermore, the cross-clade selection strategy also results in ultra-potent bNAbs.

Abstract: Summary
We describe a generalizable time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based platform to profile the cellular action of heterobifunctional degraders (or proteolysis-targeting chimeras [PROTACs]) that is capable of both accurately quantifying protein levels in whole-cell lysates in less than 1 h and measuring small-molecule target engagement to endogenous proteins, here specifically for human bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4). The detection mix consists of a single primary antibody targeting the protein of interest, a luminescent donor-labeled anti-species nanobody, and a fluorescent acceptor ligand. Importantly, our strategy can readily be applied to other targets of interest and will greatly facilitate the cell-based profiling of small-molecule inhibitors and PROTACs in a high-throughput format with unmodified cell lines. We furthermore validate our platform in the characterization of celastrol, a p-quinone methide-containing pentacyclic triterpenoid, as a broad cysteine-targeting E3 ubiquitin ligase warhead for potent and efficient targeted protein degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Individuals with Down syndrome (DS; Ts21), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, have smaller brains that reflect fewer neurons at pre- and post-natal stages, implicating impaired neurogenesis during development. Our stereological analysis of adult DS cortex indicates a reduction of calretinin-expressing interneurons. Using Ts21 human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and isogenic controls, we find that Ts21 progenitors generate fewer COUP-TFII+ progenitors with reduced proliferation. Single-cell RNA sequencing of Ts21 progenitors confirms the altered specification of progenitor subpopulations and identifies reduced WNT signaling. Activation of WNT signaling partially restores the COUP-TFII+ progenitor population in Ts21, suggesting that altered WNT signaling contributes to the defective development of cortical interneurons in DS.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetic hearts are more vulnerable to myocardial ischemia reperfusion (MIR) injury, which involves decreased mitophagy status with unknown mechanisms. MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, has been shown to have protection against ischemia reperfusion injury through upregulating mitophagy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of MitoQ on myocardium during MIR injury in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Herein, this study discovered that type 2 diabetic hearts with PINK1/Parkin downregulation suffered more MIR injury accompanied by reduced mitophagy. Treatment with MitoQ significantly decreased the levels of CK-MB, LDH, myocardial infarction, myocardial pathological damage, and cardiomyocytes apoptosis, while it improved cardiac function, mitophagy status, and PINK1/Parkin pathway in vivo study. Furthermore, MitoQ significantly reduced high glucose/high fat and hypoxia/reoxygenation induced injury in H9C2 cells as evidenced by reduced cardiomyocytes apoptosis and ROS production, and increased cell viability, the level of mitochondrial membrane potential, PINK1/Parkin expression. However, mitochondrial division inhibitor (mdivi-1), an inhibitor of mitophagy, reversed the improvement and protein expression levels of PINK1/Parkin pathway in vitro models. In conclusion, MIR induced more severe damage in T2D by reduction of mitophagy. MitoQ can confer cardioprotection following MIR in T2D by mitophagy up-regulation via PINK1/Parkin pathway.

Abstract: Vitronectin is an abundant multifunctional glycoprotein found in serum, the extracellular matrix, and bone, and is involved in diverse physiological processes. Here, we developed a new bioactive dimeric peptide (VnP-8-DN1 dimer) from a human vitronectin-derived motif (IDAAFTRINCQG; residues 206–217; VnP-8) via removal of an isoleucine residue at the N-terminus of VnP-8 and spontaneous air oxidation. The VnP-8-DN1 dimer potently enhanced cell attachment activity, and this activity was mediated by binding to cellular heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors. Moreover, the VnP-8-DN1 dimer suppressed osteoclast differentiation by blocking the early stage of osteoclastogenesis induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL). Furthermore, the VnP-8-DN1 dimer decreased the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts and increased the survival of osteoclast precursor cells by decreasing the cellular level of c-Fms and reducing RANK expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the VnP-8-DN1 dimer inhibits the early stages of M–CSF– and RANK-induced osteoclast differentiation by binding to c-Fms and inhibiting M-CSF signaling.

Abstract: Purpose
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe medical condition, is among the major causes of death in critically ill patients. Morphine is used as a therapeutic agent against severe pain. The mechanisms of its reactions over ARDS are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to assess the mechanism of morphine in rats with ARDS.
Methods
Rats were injected with lipopolysaccharide to induce ARDS, and some rats were pre-treated with graded doses of morphine in the lateral ventricles to assess survival and non-infected mortality. Immunohistochemical and HE staining were performed to measure MPO and CD68 activity in the lungs and lung injury. ELISA was conducted to detect the inflammatory factor levels in the plasma and BALF. Co-labeling of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and c-Fos was observed in the brain tissues. MOR-positive cells in brain tissues were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The effect of MOR antagonists on ARDS was examined in rats by pre-injection of naloxone or methylnaltrexone. The expression of MyD88, TLR4, and NF-κB was lastly assessed.
Results
Dose-independent improvement was observed in respiratory capacity and lung injury in ARDS rats after morphine pre-injection, along with reduced inflammatory factors in the plasma and BALF. MOR-positive cells were elevated after morphine, which occurred within the ventral part of the gigantocellular reticular nucleus (GiV). Naloxone and methylnaltrexone blocked the effects of morphine via central and peripheral MOR. Morphine activated TLR pathway in a MyD88-dependent manner.
Conclusion
Morphine activates MOR within the GiV and the TLR pathway to attenuate ARDS in rats.

Abstract: Summary
Although the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is a primary characteristic of glaucoma, astrocytes also contribute to their neurodegeneration in disease states. Although studies often explore cell-autonomous aspects of RGC neurodegeneration, a more comprehensive model of glaucoma should take into consideration interactions between astrocytes and RGCs. To explore this concept, RGCs and astrocytes were differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with a glaucoma-associated OPTN(E50K) mutation along with corresponding isogenic controls. Initial results indicated significant changes in OPTN(E50K) astrocytes, including evidence of autophagy dysfunction. Subsequently, co-culture experiments demonstrated that OPTN(E50K) astrocytes led to neurodegenerative properties in otherwise healthy RGCs, while healthy astrocytes rescued some neurodegenerative features in OPTN(E50K) RGCs. These results are the first to identify disease phenotypes in OPTN(E50K) astrocytes, including how their modulation of RGCs is affected. Moreover, these results support the concept that astrocytes could offer a promising target for therapeutic intervention in glaucoma.

Abstract: Summary
The cornea fends off chemicals, dirt, and infectious particles and provides most of the eye’s focusing power. Corneal transparency is of paramount importance to normal vision, yet how it is established and maintained remains unclear. Here, we ablated Notch1 in keratocytes using Twist2-Cre mice and found that Twist2-Cre; Notch1f/f mice developed stroma expansion and neovascularization, followed by hyperproliferation and metaplasia of corneal epithelial progenitor cells and plaque formation at central cornea, leading to loss of transparency. Development of these phenotypes does not involve bacteria-caused inflammation; instead, Notch1 deletion upregulates Vegfa and Vegfc via Hif1α in keratocytes. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor axitinib prevented development of these anomalies in Twist2-Cre; Notch1f/f mice, suggesting that VEGFs secreted by keratocytes promote not only neovascularization but also proliferation and metaplasia of epithelial progenitor cells at central cornea. This study uncovers a Notch1-Hif1α-VEGF pathway in keratocytes that maintains corneal transparency and represents a potential target for treatment of related corneal disorders.

Abstract: Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for the development of heart failure. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), an emerging class of non-protein-coding transcripts, are involved in regulation of multiple cardiac diseases through diverse molecular mechanism, whereas the role of cytoplasmic lncRNAs in regulating cardiac hypertrophy remains unclear. In this study, we identified a novel and functional long noncoding RNA Gm17501, which was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes. The expression level of lncRNA Gm17501 was altered in cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload and phenylephrine treatment. Moreover, lncRNA Gm17501 expression was decreased in the heart tissue of patients with heart failure. Silencing lncRNA Gm17501 aggravated cardiac hypertrophy under pathological stress. Inhibition of lncRNA Gm17501 did not alter the expression of nearby genes but decreased mRNA level of calcium handling proteins which were involved in cardiac contraction. Therefore, the cytoplasmic lncRNA Gm17501 might protect cardiomyocytes against hypertrophy, possibly by maintaining calcium signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the complete immune cell composition of human neuroblastoma (NB) is crucial for the development of immunotherapeutics. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on 19 human NB samples coupled with multiplex immunohistochemistry, survival analysis, and comparison with normal fetal adrenal gland data. We provide a comprehensive immune cell landscape and characterize cell-state changes from normal tissue to NB. Our analysis reveals 27 immune cell subtypes, including distinct subpopulations of myeloid, NK, B, and T cells. Several different cell types demonstrate a survival benefit. In contrast to adult cancers and previous NB studies, we show an increase in inflammatory monocyte cell state when contrasting normal and tumor tissue, while no differences in cytotoxicity and exhaustion score for T cells, nor in Treg activity, are observed. Our receptor-ligand interaction analysis reveals a highly complex interactive network of the NB microenvironment from which we highlight several interactions that we suggest for future therapeutic studies.

Abstract: Summary
Stress granules are phase-separated assemblies formed around RNAs. So far, the techniques available to identify these RNAs are not suitable for single cells and small tissues displaying cell heterogeneity. Here, we used TRIBE (target of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing) to profile stress granule RNAs. We used an RNA-binding protein (FMR1) fused to the catalytic domain of an RNA-editing enzyme (ADAR), which coalesces into stress granules upon oxidative stress. RNAs colocalized with this fusion are edited, producing mutations that are detectable by VASA sequencing. Using single-molecule FISH, we validated that this purification-free method can reliably identify stress granule RNAs in bulk and single S2 cells and in Drosophila neurons. Similar to mammalian cells, we find that stress granule mRNAs encode ATP binding, cell cycle, and transcription factors. This method opens the possibility to identify stress granule RNAs and other RNA-based assemblies in other single cells and tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Embryo studies have established that the patterning of the mouse gastrula depends on a regulatory network in which the WNT, BMP, and NODAL signaling pathways cooperate, but aspects of their respective contributions remain unclear. Studying their impact on the spatial organization and developmental trajectories of micropatterned epiblast-like cell (EpiLC) colonies, we show that NODAL is required prior to BMP action to establish the mesoderm and endoderm lineages. The presence of BMP then forces NODAL and WNT to support the formation of posterior primitive streak (PS) derivatives, while its absence allows them to promote that of anterior PS derivatives. Also, a Nodal mutation elicits more severe patterning defects in vitro than in the embryo, suggesting that ligands of extra-embryonic origin can rescue them. These results support the implication of a combinatorial process in PS patterning and illustrate how the study of micropatterned EpiLC colonies can complement that of embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) can reprogram terminally differentiated somatic cells into totipotent embryos, but with multiple defects. The nucleosome positioning, as an important epigenetic regulator for gene expression, is largely unexplored during SCNT embryonic development. Here, we mapped genome-wide nucleosome profiles in mouse SCNT embryos using ultra-low-input MNase-seq (ULI-MNase-seq). We found that the nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) around promoters underwent dramatic reestablishment, which is consistent with the cell cycle. Dynamics of nucleosome position in SCNT embryos were delayed compared to fertilized embryos. Subsequently, we found that the aberrant gene expression levels in inner cell mass (ICM) were positively correlated with promoter NDRs in donor cells, which indicated that the memory of nucleosome occupancy in donor cells was a potential barrier for SCNT-mediated reprogramming. We further confirmed that the histone acetylation level of donor cells was associated with the memory of promoter NDRs. Our study provides insight into nucleosome reconfiguration during SCNT preimplantation embryonic development.

Abstract: Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) has been implicated in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. However, the potential biomechanism and biological implications of AMD1 in breast cancer (BC) remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of abnormal expression of AMD1 in BC. The expression of AMD1 in different human BC cell lines was studied by using western blotting and qRT–PCR. In vitro cell proliferation, clone formation, cell cycle and apoptosis assays were performed to explore the effect of AMD1 on cellular proliferation. Xenograft mouse models were established to elucidate the role of AMD1 in BC growth. The expression profiles of AMD1 in 28 pairs of BC tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues (ANTs) were investigated by using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The clinical implication and prognostic evaluation of AMD1 in BC were examined by excavating the online database. We found that the expression levels of AMD1 in BC cell lines were significantly higher than those in the normal human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A. In addition, AMD1 potentiated proliferation, induced cell cycle progression and inhibited apoptosis in BC cells. Subcutaneous tumor xenografts also supported the promotive role of AMD1 in BC growth. We discovered that the level of AMD1 in BC tissues was significantly higher than that in ANTs. Using the online database, increased AMD1 was found to be associated with clinical indicators and predicted a poor prognosis in patients with BC. Our findings indicate that AMD1 elicits potent oncogenic effects on the malignant progression of BC. AMD1 might serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with BC.

Abstract: Karyotyping is an examination that helps in detecting chromosomal abnormalities. Chromosome analysis is a very challenging task which requires various steps to obtain a karyotype. The challenges associated with chromosome analysis are overlapping and touching of chromosomes. The input considered for chromosome analysis is the metaspread G band chromosomes. The proposed work mainly focus on separation the overlapped and touching chromosomes which is considered to be the major challenge in karyotype. There are various research contribution in chromosome analysis in progress which includes both low (Machine Learning) and high level (Deep Learning) methods.

Abstract: The bladder cancer-associated protein (BLCAP) gene is a tumor-suppressor gene as its encoded protein can inhibit cell proliferation by stimulating apoptosis in many malignant tumors. It is also a novel site of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA). In this study, we found by exome and transcriptome sequencing that there was an abnormal RNA editing event of the BLCAP gene in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. The editing of BLCAP transcripts promoted the degradation of BLCAP by ubiquitination, so BLCAP could not maintain its function as a tumor suppressor gene in CRC. Moreover, our further studies revealed that BLCAP could interact with Rb1 and inhibit its phosphorylation, while the loss of repressive effect due to reduced BLCAP protein levels caused by A-to-I RNA editing facilitates the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, leading to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Thus, A-to-I RNA editing events tend to play an essential role in CRC carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Mitochondrial cloning is a promising approach to achieve homoplasmic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. We previously developed a microfluidic device that performs single mitochondrion transfer from a mtDNA-intact cell to a mtDNA-less (ρ0) cell by promoting cytoplasmic connection through a microtunnel between them. In the present study, we described a method for generating transmitochondrial cybrids using the microfluidic device. After achieving mitochondrial transfer between HeLa cells and thymidine kinase-deficient ρ0143B cells using the microfluidic device, selective culture was carried out using a pyruvate and uridine (PU)-absent and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine-supplemented culture medium. The resulting cells contained HeLa mtDNA and 143B nuclei, but both 143B mtDNA and HeLa nuclei were absent in these cells. Additionally, these cells showed lower lactate production than parent ρ0143B cells and disappearance of PU auxotrophy for cell growth. These results suggest successful generation of transmitochondrial cybrids using the microfluidic device. Furthermore, we succeeded in selective harvest of generated transmitochondrial cybrids under a PU-supplemented condition by removing unfused ρ0 cells with puromycin-based selection in the microfluidic device.

Abstract: Temozolomide (TMZ) is the first-line drug for the clinical treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), but drug resistance limits its treatment benefits. This study was intended to investigate whether propofol could restrict the resistance of GBM cells to TMZ and uncover the underlying mechanisms. Human GBM cell line U251 and TMZ-resistant U251/TMZ cell line were transplanted into mice to construct GBM and TMZ-resistant GBM xenograft tumors. Tumor growth in mice was monitored, and the tumor tissues were collected for biochemical analysis. THP-1 cell differentiated into M0 subtype macrophage using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The culture medium of M0 macrophage was collected for treating U251 cells with the presence or absence of propofol or propofol + DMOG (HIF-1α activator). Results showed that propofol significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of TMZ on tumor growth, macrophage infiltration and inflammation in TMZ-resistant GBM xenograft tumors in vivo. Compared with GBM xenograft tumors, higher expression of HIF-1α, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), p-p65 and cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2) was observed in TMZ-resistant GBM xenograft tumors, but propofol co-treatment markedly reduced the expression of these proteins. In in vitro experiments, culture medium from M0 macrophage promoted U251 cell survival, inflammation and expression of HIF-1α, MGMT, p65 and Cox2, whereas inhibited cell apoptosis. However, propofol suppressed the PMA-induced THP-1 M0 macrophage activation, and propofol-treated culture medium from M0 macrophage blocked all the effects of M0 medium on U251 cells. Additionally, DMOG reversed the effect of propofol-treated M0 medium on U251 cells. In conclusion, Propofol restricted TMZ resistance via inhibiting macrophage activation and down-regulating HIF-1α expression in GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired replication has been previously linked to growth retardation and microcephaly; however, why the brain is critically affected compared with other organs remains elusive. Here, we report the differential response between early neural progenitors (neuroepithelial cells [NECs]) and fate-committed neural progenitors (NPs) to replication licensing defects. Our results show that, while NPs can tolerate altered expression of licensing factors, NECs undergo excessive replication stress, identified by impaired replication, increased DNA damage, and defective cell-cycle progression, leading eventually to NEC attrition and microcephaly. NECs that possess a short G1 phase license and activate more origins than NPs, by acquiring higher levels of DNA-bound MCMs. In vivo G1 shortening in NPs induces DNA damage upon impaired licensing, suggesting that G1 length correlates with replication stress hypersensitivity. Our findings propose that NECs possess distinct cell-cycle characteristics to ensure fast proliferation, although these inherent features render them susceptible to genotoxic stress.

Abstract: The well-documented tumor suppressor p53 is also a major stress response factor for its diverse regulation on cellular energetics. However, the effect of p53 on mitochondrial biogenesis, which plays a predominant role in response to the elevated energy demands, appears to be pleiotropic in various conditions and has not reached agreement. Mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12), reported as a bi-functional protein for its roles in both mitochondrial ribosomes and transcriptional complexes, is a core regulatory component in mitochondrial biogenesis. Here we proved that MRPL12 is transcriptionally regulated by p53. Furthermore, the p53/MRPL12 regulation of mitochondria is part of the signaling pathway that maintains the basal mitochondrial content and positively coordinates the mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in response to metabolic perturbation. Since p53 serves as the‘Guardian of the Genome’, our findings may revealed a new mechanism underlying the conditions when more ATP is warranted to maintain the genome integrity and cell survival. Therefore the pharmacological intervention or metabolic modulation (e.g., through fasting or exercise) of the p53/MRPL12 pathway promises to be a therapeutic approach that can safeguard health.

Abstract: Summary
The triggers that drive interferon-γ (IFNγ)-producing CD8 T cell (Tc1 cell)-mediated autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) remain obscure. Here, we show that lack of hematopoietic Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (Tet2), an epigenetic regulator associated with autoimmunity, results in the development of microbiota-dependent AIH-like pathology, accompanied by hepatic enrichment of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand-producing pathobionts and rampant Tc1 cell immunity. We report that AIH-like disease development is dependent on both IFNγ and AhR signaling, as blocking either reverts ongoing AIH-like pathology. Illustrating the critical role of AhR-ligand-producing pathobionts in this condition, hepatic translocation of the AhR ligand indole-3-aldehyde (I3A)-releasing Lactobacillus reuteri is sufficient to trigger AIH-like pathology. Finally, we demonstrate that I3A is required for L. reuteri-induced Tc1 cell differentiation in vitro and AIH-like pathology in vivo, both of which are restrained by Tet2 within CD8 T cells. This AIH-disease model may contribute to the development of therapeutics to alleviate AIH.

Abstract: Background
The treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is developing towards “targeted therapy”, which faces challenges such as low sensitivity and drug resistance. Therefore, targeted drugs need to be used in combination with other drugs to overcome clinical problems.
Objective
AML cells and animal models were used to determine the synergistic anti-leukemic effect of Dactolisib (BEZ235) and Venetoclax (ABT199) and explore its mechanism.
Methods
In vitro experiments, we used cell counting kit-8 (CCK8), flow cytometry, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and Western blot to detect the anti-leukemic effects of ABT199 and BEZ235. In vivo experiments, female nude mice were injected subcutaneously with THP-1 cells to form tumors, evaluate the combined effect of ABT199 and BEZ235 by indicators such as tumor size, tumor weight, Ki67 and cleaved-Caspase3 staining. The mice's body weight and HE staining were used to evaluate the liver injury and adverse drug reactions.
Results
The combination of BEZ235 and ABT199 has a synergistic effect through promoting apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation. The BEZ235 increased the drug sensitivity of ABT199 by reducing the MCL-1 protein synthesis and promoted the degradation of MCL-1 protein, which is considered as the mechanism of reversing ABT199 resistance. Furthermore, the BEZ235 and ABT199 can synergistically enhance the inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
Conclusion
The combination of BEZ235 and ABT199 exhibits a synergistic anti-tumor effect in AML by down-regulating MCL-1 protein.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) checkpoint blockade therapy requires the CD28 co-stimulatory receptor for CD8+ T cell expansion and cytotoxicity. However, CD28 expression is frequently lost in exhausted T cells and during immune senescence, limiting the clinical benefits of PD-1 immunotherapy in individuals with cancer. Here, using a cereblon knockin mouse model that regains in vivo T cell response to lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory imide drug, we show that lenalidomide reinstates the anti-tumor activity of CD28-deficient CD8+ T cells after PD-1 blockade. Lenalidomide redirects the CRL4Crbn ubiquitin ligase to degrade Ikzf1 and Ikzf3 in T cells and unleashes paracrine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and intracellular Notch signaling, which collectively bypass the CD28 requirement for activation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells and inhibition of tumor growth by PD-1 blockade. Our results suggest that PD-1 immunotherapy can benefit from a lenalidomide combination when treating solid tumors infiltrated with abundant CD28− T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a growing burden worldwide, and there is no reliable biomarker used in clinical routines to date. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is routinely collected in patients with neurological symptoms and should closely reflect alterations in PD patients’ brains. Here, we describe a scalable and sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics workflow for CSF proteome profiling. From two independent cohorts with over 200 individuals, our workflow reproducibly quantifies over 1,700 proteins from minimal CSF amounts. Machine learning determines OMD, CD44, VGF, PRL, and MAN2B1 to be altered in PD patients or to significantly correlate with clinical scores. We also uncover signatures of enhanced neuroinflammation in LRRK2 G2019S carriers, as indicated by increased levels of CTSS, PLD4, and HLA proteins. A comparison with our previously acquired urinary proteomes reveals a large overlap in PD-associated changes, including lysosomal proteins, opening up new avenues to improve our understanding of PD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by cisplatin (cis-AKI) involves indicators such as inflammation and oxidative stress (OS) in proximal tubules, although its underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown so far. Exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying cisplatin-induced AKI is of great significance for AKI prevention and also for preventing its progression into chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). OS and ferroptosis are mutually causal; they finally lead to the regulatory cell injury and death induced by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). GPX4 is critical not only in OS, but studies established as the key regulator of ferroptosis. In this context, the present study focused on determining the biological function of miR-214-3p in the cisplatin-induced ferroptosis of tubular epithelial cell (TEC) and the underlying molecular mechanism. The relationship between TEC ferroptosis and cisplatin-induced AKI was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Ferrostatin-1(Fer-1), an inhibitor of ferroptosis, was observed to confer a protective effect against the renal tubular injury and renal failure induced by cisplatin. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the genes that have important functions in the development of cis-AKI. In the present study, GPX4 was predicted as a target of miR-214–3p. Moreover, inhibiting miR-214-3p enhanced the expressions of GPX4 and SLC7A11 while decreasing the ACSL4 expression. Furthermore, miR-214-3p down-regulation protected against TEC death and renal tubule damage both in vitro and in vivo. According to these findings, inhibiting miR-214-3p would alleviate TEC ferroptosis in cis-AKI via GPX4.

Abstract: Recurrence and metastasis affect the survival rate of breast cancer patients. The fundamental reason lies in the lack of understanding of the mechanism of breast cancer metastasis. In this study, the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of breast cancer cells were evaluated. The mechanism of NUPR1/TFE3 signaling pathway on autophagy-related proteins and migration-invasion-related proteins was examined in cell model in vitro. The effects of NUPR1 on malignancy formation and metastasis were investigated in vivo. We found that NUPR1 was upregulated in breast cancer cells and tissues. NUPR1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of ZR-75-30 cells and inhibited malignancy formation and metastasis in vivo. Mechanically, NUPR1 promoted autophagy by activating of TFE3 transcription, thereby regulating breast cancer metastasis. This paper indicates that NUPR1 activates autophagy through the TFE3 signaling pathway to promote breast cancer metastasis, and provides a biological basis for the intervention of blocking distant metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Researchers often seek to decode mental states from brain activity measured with functional MRI. Rigorous decoding requires the use of formal neural prediction models, which are likely to be the most accurate if they use the whole brain. However, the computational burden and lack of interpretability of off-the-shelf statistical methods can make whole-brain decoding challenging. Here, we propose a method to build whole-brain neural decoders that are both interpretable and computationally efficient. We extend the partial least squares algorithm to build a regularized model with variable selection that offers a unique “fit once, tune later” approach: users need to fit the model only once and can choose the best tuning parameters post hoc. We show in real data that our method scales well with increasing data size and yields interpretable predictors. The algorithm is publicly available in multiple languages in the hope that interpretable whole-brain predictors can be implemented more widely in neuroimaging research.

Abstract: Exosomes play pivotal roles in intercellular communication, and pathophysiological functions. In this study, we aimed to understand the role of exosomal proteome derived from C. albicans infected mice (C57BL/6) eyeball. Exosomes were characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering and Western blot, quantified and subjected to LC-MS/MS and cytokine quantification by ELISA. The average size of exosomes was 170–200 nm with number of exosomes amounted to 1.42 × 1010 in infected set compared to control (1.24 × 109). Western blot was positive for CD9, CD63 and CD81 confirming the presence of exosomes. IL-6, IL1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ levels were significantly elevated in infected eye at 72 h.p.i. Proteomic analysis identified 42 differentially expressed proteins, of these 37 were upregulated and 5 were downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) revealed enrichment of cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organisation, and cellular response proteins such as aquaporin-5, gasdermin-A, CD5 antigen-like, Catenin, V-ATPase, and vesicle associated protein. Additionally, KEGG pathway analysis indicated the association of metabolic and carbon signalling pathways with exosomes from C. albicans infected eye. The protein cargo in exosomes released during endophthalmitis with C. albicans seems to play a unique role in the pathogenesis of the disease and further validations with larger cohort of patients is required to confirm them as biomarkers.

Abstract: Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) phosphorylates and inhibits eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). This leads to the release of eIF4E from 4E-BP1 and the initiation of eIF4E-dependent mRNA translation. In this study, we examined the expression of a 4E-BP1-based reporter (mTORC1 activity reporter; TORCAR) with various localization signal tags to clarify the relationship between the localization of 4E-BP1 and its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at threonine 37/46 and serine 65 was efficient at lysosomes and the plasma membrane, whereas it was significantly decreased in the nucleus. In addition, the localization of endogenous eIF4E shifted from the cytoplasm to the nucleus only when nuclear-localized TORCAR was expressed. Nuclear-localized TORCAR decreased cyclin D1 protein levels and altered cell cycle distribution. These data provide an experimental tool to manipulate the localization of endogenous eIF4E without affecting mTORC1 and highlight the important role of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of eIF4E.

Abstract: The significance of KDM2B in oncogenesis has been appreciated, but the mechanism behind is incompletely understood. In this work, we addressed its effects on the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Overexpression of KDM2B was linked to dismal prognoses of NSCLC patients. Based on the expression levels of KDM2B in a panel of NSCLC cell lines, A549, showing lower level of expression, and SK-MES-1, showing higher levels of expression, were selected as model systems to evaluate the effect of KDM2B overexpression and KDM2B silencing, respectively. Knockdown of KDM2B hampered NSCLC cell proliferation, invasion, as well as migration, while enhanced apoptosis. Additionally, KDM2B repressed the expression of microRNA (miR)-let-7b-5p through demethylation modification of H3K36me2, thereby promoting the expression of zester homolog 2 (EZH2), the target gene of let-7b-5p in NSCLC. Moreover, EZH2 transcriptionally induced the expression of PKMYT1 to activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Sh-EZH2 and sh-PKMYT1 neutralized the supporting effects of KDM2B on cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Additionally, deletion of KDM2B reduced the xenograft volumes in nude mice. In conclusion, KDM2B induces the EZH2/PKMYT1/Wnt/β-catenin axis by inhibiting the let-7b-5p expression, which promotes NSCLC growth. More investigations are essential to determine the oncogenic role of KDM2B in NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor escape mechanisms for immunotherapy include deficiencies in antigen presentation, diminishing adaptive CD8+ T cell antitumor activity. Although innate natural killer (NK) cells are triggered by loss of MHC class I, their response is often inadequate. To increase tumor susceptibility to both innate and adaptive immune elimination, we performed parallel genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens under NK and CD8+ T cell pressure. We identify all components, RNF31, RBCK1, and SHARPIN, of the linear ubiquitination chain assembly complex (LUBAC). Genetic and pharmacologic ablation of RNF31, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, strongly sensitizes cancer cells to NK and CD8+ T cell killing. This occurs in a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-dependent manner, causing loss of A20 and non-canonical IKK complexes from TNF receptor complex I. A small-molecule RNF31 inhibitor sensitizes colon carcinoma organoids to TNF and greatly enhances bystander killing of MHC antigen-deficient tumor cells. These results merit exploration of RNF31 inhibition as a clinical pharmacological opportunity for immunotherapy-refractory cancers.

Abstract: To date, most studies of exosomes related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have used commercial cancer cell lines or patient plasma as source material. In this study, we isolated exosomes directly from HCC tissues to investigate the potential of exosomal contents as biomarkers for HCC. Exosomes were identified and verified using transmission electron microscopy, nano-flow cytometry analysis, and western blotting. Tissue-derived exosomal miRNA expression was profiled by high-throughput sequencing, and differential expression of miRNAs was validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. The diagnostic performance of differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs for HCC was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Target genes of these miRNAs were verified using luciferase reporter assays, and their functions were studied through in vitro and rescue assays. In total, 225 differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs were identified in HCC samples compared with adjacent liver tissues, and some were associated with HCC tumorigenesis and progression. Comparison of the expression profiles of tissue-derived and plasma-derived exosomal miRNAs identified hsa-miR-483-5p as the only differentially expressed miRNA detected in both HCC tissue and plasma, and this was in a validation group of HCC patients. Analysis of the diagnostic performance of plasma exosomal hsa-miR-483-5p or plasma hsa-miR-483-5p found that both could differentiate HCC and non-HCC cases. In vitro ectopic miR-483-5p expression promoted HCC cell proliferation. CDK15 was confirmed to bind with miR-483-5p directly, and thus, miR-483-5p may function by downregulating CDK15. Hsa-miR-483-5p represents a potential specific and sensitive biomarker for HCC diagnosis.

Abstract: Summary
Astrocytes are emerging key players in neurological disorders. However, their role in disease etiology is poorly understood owing to inaccessibility of primary human astrocytes. Pluripotent stem cell-derived cells fail to mimic age and due to their clonal origin do not mimic genetic heterogeneity of patients. In contrast, direct conversion constitutes an attractive approach to generate human astrocytes that capture age and genetic diversity. We describe efficient direct conversion of human fibroblasts to functional induced astrocytes (iAs). Expression of the minimal combination Sox9 and Nfib generates iAs with molecular, phenotypic, and functional properties resembling primary human astrocytes. iAs could be obtained by conversion of fibroblasts covering the entire human lifespan. Importantly, iAs supported function of induced neurons obtained through direct conversion from the same fibroblast population. Fibroblast-derived iAs will become a useful tool to elucidate the biology of astrocytes and complement current in vitro models for studies of late-onset neurological disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The biological determinants underlying the range of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) clinical manifestations are not fully understood. Here, over 1,400 plasma proteins and 2,600 single-cell immune features comprising cell phenotype, endogenous signaling activity, and signaling responses to inflammatory ligands are cross-sectionally assessed in peripheral blood from 97 patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 and 40 uninfected patients. Using an integrated computational approach to analyze the combined plasma and single-cell proteomic data, we identify and independently validate a multi-variate model classifying COVID-19 severity (multi-class area under the curve [AUC]training = 0.799, p = 4.2e-6; multi-class AUCvalidation = 0.773, p = 7.7e-6). Examination of informative model features reveals biological signatures of COVID-19 severity, including the dysregulation of JAK/STAT, MAPK/mTOR, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) immune signaling networks in addition to recapitulating known hallmarks of COVID-19. These results provide a set of early determinants of COVID-19 severity that may point to therapeutic targets for prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 progression.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas systems must enact robust immunity against foreign genetic material without inducing cytotoxic autoimmunity. For type VI systems that use Cas13 nucleases and recognize RNA targets, immune activation requires extensive CRISPR RNA (crRNA) guide-target complementarity and a target-flanking motif. Here, we report a third requirement shaping the immune response: the expression of the target transcript exceeding a threshold. We found that endogenous non-essential transcripts targeted by crRNAs rarely elicited autoimmunity. Instead, autoimmune induction required over-expressing the targeted transcripts above a threshold. A genome-wide screen confirmed target expression levels as a global determinant of cytotoxic autoimmunity and revealed that this threshold shifts with each guide-target pair. This threshold further ensured defense against a lytic bacteriophage yet allowed the tolerance of a targeted beneficial gene expressed from an invading plasmid. These findings establish target expression levels as an additional criterion for immune defense by RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems, preventing autoimmunity and distinguishing pathogenic and benign invaders.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell imaging of individual mRNAs has revealed core mechanisms of the central dogma. However, most approaches require cell fixation or have limited sensitivity for live-cell applications. Here, we describe SunRISER (SunTag-based reporter for imaging signal-enriched mRNA), a computationally and experimentally optimized approach for unambiguous detection of single mRNA molecules in living cells. When viewed by epifluorescence microscopy, SunRISER-labeled mRNAs show strong signal to background and resistance to photobleaching, which together enable long-term mRNA imaging studies. SunRISER variants, using 8× and 10× stem-loop arrays, demonstrate effective mRNA detection while significantly reducing alterations to target mRNA sequences. We characterize SunRISER to observe mRNA inheritance during mitosis and find that stressors enhance diversity among post-mitotic sister cells. Taken together, SunRISER enables a glimpse into living cells to observe aspects of the central dogma and the role of mRNAs in rare and dynamical trafficking events.

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute (Ago) proteins are widespread nucleic-acid-guided enzymes that recognize targets through complementary base pairing. Although, in eukaryotes, Agos are involved in RNA silencing, the functions of prokaryotic Agos (pAgos) remain largely unknown. In particular, a clade of truncated and catalytically inactive pAgos (short pAgos) lacks characterization. Here, we reveal that a short pAgo protein in the archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus, together with its two genetically associated proteins, Aga1 and Aga2, provide robust antiviral protection via abortive infection. Aga2 is a toxic transmembrane effector that binds anionic phospholipids via a basic pocket, resulting in membrane depolarization and cell killing. Ago and Aga1 form a stable complex that exhibits nucleic-acid-directed nucleic-acid-recognition ability and directly interacts with Aga2, pointing to an immune sensing mechanism. Together, our results highlight the cooperation between pAgos and their widespread associated proteins, suggesting an uncharted diversity of pAgo-derived immune systems.

Abstract: Summary
The observation that trophoblast (TB) can be generated from primed pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) by exposure to bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) when FGF2 and ACTIVIN signaling is minimized has recently been challenged with the suggestion that the procedure instead produces amnion. Here, by analyzing transcriptome data from multiple sources, including bulk and single-cell data, we show that the BMP4 procedure generates bona fide TB with similarities to both placental villous TB and TB generated from TB stem cells. The analyses also suggest that the transcriptomic signatures between embryonic amnion and different forms of TB have commonalities. Our data provide justification for the continued use of TB derived from PSCs as a model for investigating placental development.

Abstract: Summary
Chemogenetic methods enabling the rapid translocation of specific proteins to the plasma membrane (PM) in a single protein-single ligand manner are useful tools in cell biology. We recently developed a technique, in which proteins fused to an Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) variant carrying N-terminal hexalysine residues are recruited from the cytoplasm to the PM using the synthetic myristoyl-d-Cys-tethered trimethoprim (mDcTMP) ligand. However, this system achieved PM-specific translocation only when the eDHFR tag was fused to the N terminus of proteins, thereby limiting its application. In this report, we engineered a universal PM-targeting tag for mDcTMP-induced protein translocation by grafting the hexalysine motif into an intra-loop region of eDHFR. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the new loop-engineered eDHFR tag and mDcTMP pair for conditional PM recruitment and activation of various tag-fused signaling proteins with different fusion configurations and for reversibly and repeatedly controlling protein localization to generate synthetic signal oscillations.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) by forced expression of cardiogenic transcription factors. However, it remains unknown how fibroblasts adopt a cardiomyocyte (CM) fate during their spontaneous ongoing transdifferentiation toward myofibroblasts (MFs). By tracing fibroblast lineages following cardiac reprogramming in vitro, we found that most mature iCMs are derived directly from fibroblasts without transition through the MF state. This direct conversion is attributable to mutually exclusive induction of cardiac sarcomeres and MF cytoskeletal structures in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts during reprogramming. For direct fate switch from fibroblasts to iCMs, significant remodeling of actin isoforms occurs in fibroblasts, including induction of α-cardiac actin and decrease of the actin isoforms predominant in MFs. Accordingly, genetic or pharmacological ablation of MF-enriched actin isoforms significantly enhances cardiac reprogramming. Our results demonstrate that remodeling of actin isoforms is required for fibroblast to CM fate conversion by cardiac reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular stress and toxicity are often associated with the formation of protein multimers, or aggregates. Numerous degenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease, prion-propagated disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cardiac amyloidosis, and diabetes, are characterized by aggregated protein deposits. Current methods are limited in the ability to assess multimer size along with multimer quantitation and to incorporate one or more ancillary traits, including target specificity, operative simplicity, and process speed. Here, we report development of a microparticle immunocapture assay that combines the advantages inherent to a monoclonal antibody:protein interaction with highly quantitative flow cytometry analysis. Using established reagents to build our platform, and aggregation-prone amyloid beta 1-42 peptide (Aβ42) and alpha-synuclein to demonstrate proof of principle, our results indicate that this assay is a highly adaptable method to measure multimer size and quantity at the same time in a technically streamlined workflow applicable to laboratory and clinical samples.

Abstract: Summary
Although recombination is a feature of coronavirus evolution, previously detected recombinant lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have shown limited circulation thus far. Here, we present a detailed phylogenetic analysis of four SARS-CoV-2 lineages to investigate the possibility of virus recombination among them. Our analyses reveal well-supported phylogenetic differences between the Orf1ab region encoding viral non-structural proteins and the rest of the genome, including Spike (S) protein and remaining reading frames. By accounting for several deletions in NSP6, Orf3a, and S, we conclude that the B.1.628 major cluster, now designated as lineage XB, originated from a recombination event between viruses of B.1.631 and B.1.634 lineages. This scenario is supported by the spatiotemporal distribution of these lineages across the USA and Mexico during 2021, suggesting that the recombination event originated in this geographical region. This event raises important questions regarding the role and potential effects of recombination on SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the malignant tumors most frequently encountered in the clinic. Studies have shown that the abnormal expression of various genes leads to the malignant progression of tumors, and the modification in DNA methylation can cause a change in gene expression. Increasing evidence has shown that abnormal expression of PCDH17 is found in many human cancers. However, its functional role in HCC remains unexplored. Herein, we found that PCDH17 was expressed at low levels in HCC tissues and cell lines. There is a significant correlation between low expression of PCDH17 and poor prognosis of HCC patients. Increased expression of PCDH17 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC. The low expression of PCDH17 was due to its high DNA methylation level, and changing the expression of DNMT3B significantly affect the DNA methylation level of PCDH17 and increase its protein expression. Furthermore, methylation of PCDH17 regulated by DNMT3B affects the malignant biological behavior of HCC through EMT. In conclusion, PCDH17 participates in malignant biological behavior of HCC and that DNMT3B plays an important role in the regulation of PCDH17 methylation, which affects the malignant progression of HCC.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) emerged early in evolution and occur in all domains of life and nearly in all species, including humans. Mutations in four sHSPs (HspB1, HspB3, HspB5, HspB8) are associated with neuromuscular disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolutionary forces shaping these sHSPs during vertebrate evolution. We performed comparative evolutionary analyses on a set of orthologous sHSP sequences, based on the ratio of non-synonymous: synonymous substitution rates for each codon. We found that these sHSPs had been historically exposed to different degrees of purifying selection, decreasing in this order: HspB8 > HspB1, HspB5 > HspB3. Within each sHSP, regions with different degrees of purifying selection can be discerned, resulting in characteristic selective pressure profiles. The conserved α-crystallin domains were exposed to the most stringent purifying selection compared to the flanking regions, supporting a 'dimorphic pattern' of evolution. Thus, during vertebrate evolution the different sequence partitions were exposed to different and measurable degrees of selective pressures. Among the disease-associated mutations, most are missense mutations primarily in HspB1 and to a lesser extent in the other sHSPs. Our data provide an explanation for this disparate incidence. Contrary to the expectation, most missense mutations cause dominant disease phenotypes. Theoretical considerations support a connection between the historic exposure of these sHSP genes to a high degree of purifying selection and the unusual prevalence of genetic dominance of the associated disease phenotypes. Our study puts the genetics of inheritable sHSP-borne diseases into the context of vertebrate evolution.

Abstract: As in many other cancers, highly malignant proliferation and disordered cell division play irreplaceable roles in the exceedingly easy recurrence and complex progression of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM); however, mechanistic studies of the numerous regulators involved in this process are still insufficiently thorough. The role of BCAS3 has been studied in other cancers, but its role in GBM is unclear. Here, our goal was to investigate the expression pattern of BCAS3 in GBM and its potential mechanism of action. Using TCGA database and human GBM samples, we found that BCAS3 expression was up-regulated in GBM, and its high expression predicted poor prognosis. To further investigate the relationship between BCAS3 and GBM characteristics, we up-regulated and down-regulated BCAS3 expression in GBM to detect its effect on cell proliferation and cell cycle. At the same time, we established U87 cells stably overexpressing BCAS3 and generated an intracranial xenograft model to investigate the Potential role of BCAS3 in vivo. Finally, based on in vitro cell experiments and in vivo GBM xenograft models, we observed that BCAS3 significantly regulates GBM cell proliferation and cell cycle and that this regulation is associated with p53/GADD45α Signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that BCAS3 is inextricably linked to the progression of GBM and that targeting BCAS3 may have therapeutic effects in GBM patients.

Abstract: Summary
Cell cycle and differentiation decisions are linked; however, the underlying principles that drive these decisions are unclear. Here, we combined cell-cycle reporter system and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiling to study the transcriptomes of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the context of cell-cycle states and differentiation. By applying retinoic acid, to G1 and G2/M ESCs, we show that, while both populations can differentiate toward epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), only G2/M ESCs could differentiate into extraembryonic endoderm cells. We identified Esrrb, a pluripotency factor that is upregulated during G2/M, as a driver of extraembryonic endoderm stem cell (XEN) differentiation. Furthermore, enhancer chromatin states based on wild-type (WT) and ESRRB knockout (KO) ESCs show association of ESRRB with XEN poised enhancers. G1 cells overexpressing Esrrb allow ESCs to produce XENs, while ESRRB-KO ESCs lost their potential to differentiate into XEN. Overall, this study reveals a vital link between Esrrb and cell-cycle states during the exit from pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (hESC-RPE) are a promising cell source to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Despite several ongoing clinical studies, a detailed mapping of transient cellular states during in vitro differentiation has not been performed. Here, we conduct single-cell transcriptomic profiling of an hESC-RPE differentiation protocol that has been developed for clinical use. Differentiation progressed through a culture diversification recapitulating early embryonic development, whereby cells rapidly acquired a rostral embryo patterning signature before converging toward the RPE lineage. At intermediate steps, we identified and examined the potency of an NCAM1+ retinal progenitor population and showed the ability of the protocol to suppress non-RPE fates. We demonstrated that the method produces a pure RPE pool capable of maturing further after subretinal transplantation in a large-eyed animal model. Our evaluation of hESC-RPE differentiation supports the development of safe and efficient pluripotent stem cell-based therapies for AMD.

Abstract: Summary
There is no cure for HIV infection, as the virus establishes a latent reservoir, which escapes highly active antiretroviral treatments. One major obstacle is the difficulty identifying cells that harbor latent proviruses. We devised a single-round viral vector that carries a series of versatile reporter molecules that are expressed in an LTR-dependent or LTR-independent manner and make it possible to accurately distinguish productive from latent infection. Using primary human CD4+ T cells, we show that transcriptionally silent proviruses are found in more than 50% of infected cells. The latently infected cells harbor proviruses but lack evidence for multiple spliced transcripts. LTR-silent integrations occurred to variable degrees in all CD4+ T subsets examined, with CD4+ TEM and CD4+ TREG displaying the highest frequency of latent infections. This viral vector permits the interrogation of HIV latency at single-cell resolution, revealing mechanisms of latency establishment and allowing the characterization of effective latency-reversing agents.

Abstract: Radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBEs) refer to a series of reactions displaying in nonirradiated cells triggered by signals from irradiated cells. Though bystander effects induced by ionizing radiation have been well studied, there are still limited data on ultraviolet(UV) induced bystander effects(UV-RIBEs). Studies have verified that exosomes, acting as a new tool of intercellular communication, participate in ionizing radiation-induced bystander effect. The purpose of what we studied was to explore the function of exosomes in UV-RIBEs, and seeking the relevant mechanism. Human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) were exposed to a single dose of ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation (20 J/cm2) or ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (60 mJ/cm2), respectively. Exosomes were isolated from the culture medium of HSFs by differential ultracentrifugation. Three endpoints relevant to potodamage were used in the evaluation of UV-RIBEs, which including the cell proliferation, oxidative damage, and apoptosis. Our results showed that exosomes from UV-irradiated cells contributed to UV-RIBEs. The expression of miR-4655–3p in exosomes increased after UV radiation and exosomes assisted in the transportation of miR-4655–3p between cells. The upregulation of miR-4655–3p enhanced the UV-RIBEs in the bystander cells. MiR-4655–3p restrained the expression of E2F2 through direct binding to its 3′-UTR. In addition, E2F2 contributed to the cell proliferation and decreased oxidative damage of HSFs. To sum up that exosomal miR-4655–3p plays a crucial role in UV-RIBEs and this function mentioned partially related to the inhibition of E2F2.

Abstract: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a tumorigenic cell subpopulation, which contributes to treatment resistance, tumor recurrence, and metastasis. This study aimed to investigate the role and underlying molecular targets of high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) in the progression and CSCs regulation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HMGA2 mRNA and protein expression levels were examined in HNSCC specimens and cells by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. The roles of HMGA2 were validated via loss-of-function and exogenous overexpression experiments in vitro and in vivo, and CSCs properties were assessed by tumorsphere formation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays provided further insight into the molecular mechanisms by which HMGA2 regulates stemness. HMGA2 was abnormally overexpressed in HNSCC, and it promoted the expression of the CSCs markers including SOX2, CD133, CD44, ALDH1A1, and Bmi1. HMGA2 was correlated with stemness, malignant progression, and reduced survival in HNSCC. Luciferase reporter assay indicated that Snai2 was a direct downstream target gene of HMGA2. Mechanistically, ChIP-qPCR assay showed that HMGA2 was recruited to three binding sites on the Snai2 promoter, directly facilitating the transcription of Snai2 in HNSCC. Snai2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of HMGA2 interference on the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of HNSCC and CSC marker expression in vitro and in vivo. HMGA2 promoted the malignant progression of HNSCC and acquired CSCs properties through direct regulation of Snai2, thereby suggesting that targeting the HMGA2-Snai2 axis might be a promising therapeutic strategy for HNSCC.

Abstract: Induction of differentiation sensitizes chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells to the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib by mechanisms that remain unknown. We previously identified the BCR-ABL downstream effector CD69 which inhibits imatinib-induced CML cell differentiation. Herein, we found that the erythroid differentiation inducers activin A and aclacinomycin A induced expression of erythroid markers (α-globin, ζ-globin, GATA-1, and glycophorin A) and simultaneously reduced CD69 levels in K562 CML cells. Blockade of p38MAPK by SB203580 and shRNA eliminated the inhibitory effect of activin A on the promoter, mRNA, and protein levels and positive cell population of CD69. CD69 overexpression inhibited activin A-induced erythroid marker expression. Pretreatment of K562 cells with activin A to induce differentiation followed by a subtoxic concentration of imatinib caused growth inhibition and apoptosis that was reduced by CD69 overexpression. Activin A also reduced the expression of CD69's potential downstream molecule metallothionein 2A (MT2A) via p38MAPK. MT2A-knockdown reduced CD69 inhibition of activin A-induced erythroid marker expression. Furthermore, MT2A-knockdown reduced CD69 inhibition of activin A-imatinib sequential treatment-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis in K562 and BCR-ABL-expressing CD34+ cells. These results suggest that CD69 inhibits activin A induction of erythroid differentiation-mediated CML cell sensitivity to imatinib via MT2A. Therefore, activin A induction of erythroid differentiation sensitizes BCR-ABL-positive cells to imatinib by downregulating the erythroid differentiation suppressors CD69 and MT2A.

Abstract: Summary
Congenital alterations in the levels of the transcription factor Forkhead box g1 (FOXG1) coding gene trigger “FOXG1 syndrome,” a spectrum that recapitulates birth defects found in the “congenital Zika syndrome,” such as microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental conditions. Here, we report that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection alters FOXG1 nuclear localization and causes its downregulation, thus impairing expression of genes involved in cell replication and apoptosis in several cell models, including human neural progenitor cells. Growth factors, such as EGF and FGF2, and Thr271 residue located in FOXG1 AKT domain, take part in the nuclear displacement and apoptosis protection, respectively. Finally, by progressive deletion of FOXG1 sequence, we identify the C-terminus and the residues 428–481 as critical domains. Collectively, our data suggest a causal mechanism by which ZIKV affects FOXG1, its target genes, cell cycle progression, and survival of human neural progenitors, thus contributing to microcephaly.

Abstract: Summary
Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR) is a co-stimulatory receptor and an important target for cancer immunotherapy. We herein present a potent FcγR-independent GITR agonist IBI37G5 that can effectively activate effector T cells and synergize with anti-programmed death 1 (PD1) antibody to eradicate established tumors. IBI37G5 depends on both antibody bivalency and GITR homo-dimerization for efficient receptor cross-linking. Functional analyses reveal bell-shaped dose responses due to the unique 2:2 antibody-receptor stoichiometry required for GITR activation. Antibody self-competition is observed after concentration exceeded that of 100% receptor occupancy (RO), which leads to antibody monovalent binding and loss of activity. Retrospective pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics analysis demonstrates that the maximal efficacy is achieved at medium doses with drug exposure near saturating GITR occupancy during the dosing cycle. Finally, we propose an alternative dose-finding strategy that does not rely on the traditional maximal tolerated dose (MTD)-based paradigm but instead on utilizing the RO-function relations as biomarker to guide the clinical translation of GITR and similar co-stimulatory agonists.

Abstract: Summary
Hippocampal neurogenesis declines with aging. Wnt ligands and antagonists within the hippocampal neurogenic niche regulate the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and the development of new neurons, and the changes of their levels in the niche mediate aging-associated decline of neurogenesis. We found that RNA-binding protein LIN28A remained existent in neural progenitor cells and granule neurons in the adult hippocampus and that it decreased with aging. Lin28a knockout inhibited the responsiveness of neural progenitor cells to niche Wnt agonists and reduced neurogenesis, thus impairing pattern separation. Overexpression of Lin28a increased the proliferation of neural progenitor cells, promoted the functional integration of newborn neurons, restored neurogenesis in Wnt-deficient dentate gyrus, and rescued the impaired pattern separation in aging mice. Our data suggest that LIN28A regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis as an intracellular mechanism by responding to niche Wnt signals, and its decrease is involved in aging-associated decline of hippocampal neurogenesis and related cognitive functions.

Abstract: Summary
Dissemination of cancer cells from primary tumors to the brain occurs in many cancer patients, increasing morbidity and death. There is an unmet medical need to develop translational platforms to evaluate therapeutic responses. Toward this goal, we established a library of 23 patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of brain metastases (BMs) from eight distinct primary tumors. In vivo tumor formation correlates with patients’ poor survival. Mouse subcutaneous xenografts develop spontaneous metastases and intracardiac PDXs increase dissemination to the CNS, both models mimicking the dissemination pattern of the donor patient. We test the FDA-approved drugs buparlisib (pan-PI3K inhibitor) and everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) and show their efficacy in treating our models. Finally, we show by RNA sequencing that human BMs and their matched PDXs have similar transcriptional profiles. Overall, these models of BMs recapitulate the biology of human metastatic disease and can be valuable translational platforms for precision medicine.

Abstract: Summary
The increasingly frequent outbreaks of pathogenic viruses have underlined the urgent need to improve our arsenal of antivirals that can be deployed for future pandemics. Innate immunity is a powerful first line of defense against pathogens, and compounds that boost the innate response have high potential to act as broad-spectrum antivirals. Here, we harnessed localization-dependent protein-complementation assays (called Alpha Centauri) to measure the nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), thus providing a readout of innate immune activation following viral infection that is applicable to high-throughput screening of immunomodulatory molecules. As proof of concept, we screened a library of kinase inhibitors on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and identified Gilteritinib as a powerful enhancer of innate responses to viral infection. This immunostimulatory activity of Gilteritinib was found to be dependent on the AXL-IRF7 axis and results in a broad and potent antiviral activity against unrelated RNA viruses.

Abstract: Summary
The reactivity of RNA 2ʹ-OH acylation is broadly useful both in probing structure and in preparing conjugates. To date, this reactivity has been analyzed in limited sets of biological RNA sequences, leaving open questions of how reactivity varies inherently without regard to sequence in structured contexts. We constructed and probed “generic” structured RNA libraries using homogeneous loop sequences, employing deep sequencing to carry out a systematic survey of reactivity. We find a wide range of RNA reactivities among single-stranded sequences, with nearest neighbors playing substantial roles. Remarkably, certain small loops are found to be far more reactive on average (up to 4,000-fold) than single-stranded RNAs, due to conformational constraints that enhance reactivity. Among loops, we observe large variations in reactivity based on size, type, and position. The results lend insights into RNA designs for achieving high-efficiency local conjugation and provide new opportunities to refine structure analysis.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons (MNs). There are no effective treatments and patients usually die within 2–5 years of diagnosis. Emerging commonalities between familial and sporadic cases of this complex multifactorial disorder include disruption to RNA processing and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing TDP-43 and/or FUS protein aggregates. Both TDP-43 and FUS have been implicated in RNA processing functions, including microRNA biogenesis, transcription, and splicing. In this study, we explore the misexpression of microRNAs in an iPSC-based disease model of FUS ALS. We identify the downregulation of miR-139, an MN-enriched microRNA, in FUS and sporadic ALS MN. We discover that miR-139 downregulation leads to the activation of canonical WNT signaling and demonstrate that the WNT transcriptional mediator β-catenin is a major driver of MN degeneration in ALS. Our results highlight the importance of homeostatic RNA networks in ALS.

Abstract: Summary
Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis associates SNPs with gene expression; these relationships can be represented as a bipartite network with association strength as “edge weights” between SNPs and genes. However, most eQTL networks use binary edge weights based on thresholded FDR estimates: definitions that influence reproducibility and downstream analyses. We constructed twenty-nine tissue-specific eQTL networks using GTEx data and evaluated a comprehensive set of network specifications based on false discovery rates, test statistics, and p values, focusing on the degree centrality—a metric of an SNP or gene node’s potential network influence. We found a thresholded Benjamini-Hochberg q value weighted by the Z-statistic balances metric reproducibility and computational efficiency. Our estimated gene degrees positively correlate with gene degrees in gene regulatory networks, demonstrating that these networks are complementary in understanding regulation. Gene degrees also correlate with genetic diversity, and heritability analyses show that highly connected nodes are enriched for tissue-relevant traits.

Abstract: Human CUB and Sushi multiple domains (CSMD1) is considered a crucial role in cancer progression, but the specific function in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is not clear. Understanding the role of CSMD1 in ESCC progression may lead to a novel strategy for ESCC treatment. Here, we found that both CSMD1 mRNA and protein levels were downregulated in ESCC tissues. Reduced CSMD1 expression was correlated with a poor prognosis in ESCC patients. CSMD1 expression inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion in ESCC cell lines in vitro. CSMD1 deficiency in established xenografted tumors increases tumor size and weight. We further found that CSMD1-overexpression cells are more sensitive to chemotherapy. Moreover, we addressed the role of CSMD1 in the CD8+ T cell immune response. An in vitro killing assay showed that the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells was inhibited in CSMD1-overexpression tumor cells. In vivo, in CSMD1 deficiency tumor-bearing mice activation and expansion of CD8+ T cells were increased. Further investigation showed that CSMD1 expression on tumor cells was positively correlated with CD8+ T cells infiltration and cytokines secretion. These findings highlight that CSMD1 is a tumor suppressor gene in ESCC patients and a positive regulator of CD8+ T cells expansion and activation, and could increase cytokines secretion, indicating that tumor cell-associated CSMD1 might be a target for ESCC.

Abstract: Summary
The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed more than 5 million lives. Emerging variants of concern (VOCs) continually challenge viral control. Directing vaccine-induced humoral and cell-mediated responses to mucosal surfaces may enhance vaccine efficacy. Here we investigate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of optimized synthetic DNA plasmids encoding wild-type severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein (pS) co-formulated with the plasmid-encoded mucosal chemokine cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (pCTACK; CCL27). pCTACK-co-immunized animals exhibit increased spike-specific antibodies at the mucosal surface and increased frequencies of interferon gamma (IFNγ)+ CD8+ T cells in the respiratory mucosa. pCTACK co-immunization confers 100% protection from heterologous Delta VOC challenge. This study shows that mucosal chemokine adjuvants can direct vaccine-induced responses to specific immunological sites and have significant effects on heterologous challenge. Further study of this unique chemokine-adjuvanted vaccine approach in the context of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is likely important.

Abstract: Missed abortion (MA) is a special form of spontaneous abortion that is increasing in incidence. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying MA, especially regarding the decidua, are poorly understood. Herein, we identified molecular signaling pathways related to MA by comparing the decidua of women experiencing normal pregnancy and MA using a quantitative proteomics approach based on HPLC-MS/MS and iTRAQ labeling. Integrated bioinformatics analysis of villi and decidua was performed to reveal potential crosstalk signals in closely related tissues. We identified 2277 proteins with high confidence in decidua, of which 232 were differentially expressed in MA samples. Specifically, we reported that integrated quantitative proteomic and bioinformatic analysis revealed altered proteins in MA and the mechanisms underpinning MA involved numerous pathways, especially ribosome and cellular metabolism signaling. Moreover, Importin 9, Cullin 1 and COX6C are critical for MA, and their altered expression might contribute to the pathophysiology of MA. In particular, COX6C was dramatically down-regulated in both decidua and villi of MA. COX6C was also found to be highly expressed in syncytiotrophoblastic and cytotrophoblastic cells in villi and widely expressed in decidua of the control group, but dramatically decreased in the MA group. Functional analysis showed that knockdown of COX6C inhibited apoptosis process in both HTR-8 and SiHa cells, suggesting that COX6C may play protective effects in MA. Thus, this study could help to map the regulatory protein network related to MA and contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms of MA.

Abstract: In yeast, the Slt2(Mpk1) stress-activated protein kinase directs the activation of two transcription factors, Rlm1 and Swi4/Swi6, in response to cell wall stress. Rlm1 is activated through a phosphorylation by Slt2, whereas the Swi4/Swi6 activation is noncatalytic and triggered by the binding of phosphorylated forms of both Slt2 and a catalytically inactive pseudokinase (Mlp1). Previous studies have delineated a role for the molecular chaperone Hsp90 in the activation of Slt2, but the involvement of Hsp90 in these events of catalytic versus non-catalytic cell integrity signaling has remained elusive. In cells lacking Mlp1, the Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol was found to inhibit the Slt2-mediated catalytic activation of Rlm1, but not the noncatalytic activation of Swi4/Swi6. Mutation of residues in the TEY motif of the Slt2 activation loop strongly impacted both Hsp90 binding and Rlm1-mediated transcription. In contrast, many of these same mutations had only modest effects on Swi4/6 (Slt2-mediated, non-catalytic) transcription, although one that blocked both the Slt2:Hsp90 interaction and Rlm1-mediated transcription (E191G) triggered a hyperactivation of Swi4/6. Taken together, our results cement the importance of the Slt2 activation loop for both the binding of Hsp90 by Slt2 and the catalytic activation of cell integrity signaling.

We further developed complementary all-in-one vectors that are over one log-scale more sensitive to doxycycline-mediated activation in vitro than previous methods and resistant to shRNA inactivation in vivo. We demonstrate the utility of this system for intracranial expression of shRNAs in a glioblastoma model. Additionally, we leverage this platform to target the redundant RAF signaling node in a mouse model of KRAS-mutant cancer and show that robust combinatorial synthetic lethality efficiently abolishes tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
From individual cells to whole organisms, O2 transport unfolds across micrometer- to millimeter-length scales and can change within milliseconds in response to fluid flows and organismal behavior. The spatiotemporal complexity of these processes makes the accurate assessment of O2 dynamics via currently available methods difficult or unreliable. Here, we present “sensPIV,” a method to simultaneously measure O2 concentrations and flow fields. By tracking O2-sensitive microparticles in flow using imaging technologies that allow for instantaneous referencing, we measured O2 transport within (1) microfluidic devices, (2) sinking model aggregates, and (3) complex colony-forming corals. Through the use of sensPIV, we find that corals use ciliary movement to link zones of photosynthetic O2 production to zones of O2 consumption. SensPIV can potentially be extendable to study flow-organism interactions across many life-science and engineering applications.

Abstract: Summary
Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) have recently been derived from human embryos and early-first-trimester placenta; however, aside from ethical challenges, the unknown disease potential of these cells limits their scientific utility. We have previously established a bone morphogetic protein 4 (BMP4)-based two-step protocol for differentiation of primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into functional trophoblasts; however, those trophoblasts could not be maintained in a self-renewing TSC-like state. Here, we use the first step from this protocol, followed by a switch to newly developed TSC medium, to derive bona fide TSCs. We show that these cells resemble placenta- and naive hPSC-derived TSCs, based on their transcriptome as well as their in vitro and in vivo differentiation potential. We conclude that primed hPSCs can be used to generate functional TSCs through a simple protocol, which can be applied to a widely available set of existing hPSCs, including induced pluripotent stem cells, derived from patients with known birth outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Individuals with primary antibody deficiency (PAD) syndromes have poor humoral immune responses requiring immunoglobulin replacement therapy. We followed individuals with PAD after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination by evaluating their immunoglobulin replacement products and serum for anti-spike binding, Fcγ receptor (FcγR) binding, and neutralizing activities. The immunoglobulin replacement products tested have low anti-spike and receptor-binding domain (RBD) titers and neutralizing activity. In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-naive individuals with PAD, anti-spike and RBD titers increase after mRNA vaccination but wane by 90 days. Those vaccinated after SARS-CoV-2 infection develop higher and more sustained responses comparable with healthy donors. Most vaccinated individuals with PAD have serum-neutralizing antibody titers above an estimated correlate of protection against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and Delta virus but not against Omicron virus, although this is improved by boosting. Thus, some immunoglobulin replacement products likely have limited protective activity, and immunization and boosting of individuals with PAD with mRNA vaccines should confer at least short-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron.

Abstract: Summary
A major technical limitation hindering the widespread adoption of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived gastrointestinal (GI) organoid technologies is the need for de novo hPSC differentiation and dependence on spontaneous morphogenesis to produce detached spheroids. Here, we report a method for simple, reproducible, and scalable production of small intestinal organoids (HIOs) based on the aggregation of cryopreservable hPSC-derived mid-hindgut endoderm (MHE) monolayers. MHE aggregation eliminates variability in spontaneous spheroid production and generates HIOs that are comparable to those arising spontaneously. With a minor modification to the protocol, MHE can be cryopreserved, thawed, and aggregated, facilitating HIO production without de novo hPSC differentiation. Finally, aggregation can also be used to generate antral stomach organoids and colonic organoids. This improved method removes significant barriers to the implementation and successful use of hPSC-derived GI organoid technologies and provides a framework for improved dissemination and increased scalability of GI organoid production.

Abstract: Summary
Conjunctival epithelial cells, which express viral-entry receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), constitute the largest exposed epithelium of the ocular surface tissue and may represent a relevant viral-entry route. To address this question, we generated an organotypic air-liquid-interface model of conjunctival epithelium, composed of basal, suprabasal, and superficial epithelial cells, and fibroblasts, which could be maintained successfully up to day 75 of differentiation. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), with complementary imaging and virological assays, we observed that while all conjunctival cell types were permissive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome expression, a productive infection did not ensue. The early innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in conjunctival cells was characterised by a robust autocrine and paracrine NF-κB activity, without activation of antiviral interferon signalling. Collectively, these data enrich our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the human ocular surface, with potential implications for the design of preventive strategies and conjunctival transplantation.

Abstract: Cancer cells generally overexpress heat shock proteins (Hsps), the major components of cellular stress response, to overcome and survive the diverse stresses. However, the specific roles of Hsps in initiation and establishment of cancers remain unclear. Using loss of Lgl-mediated epithelial tumorigenesis in Drosophila, we induced tumorigenic somatic clones of different genetic backgrounds to examine the temporal and spatial expression and roles of major heat shock proteins in tumor growth. The constitutively expressed Hsp83, Hsc70 (heat shock cognate), Hsp60 and Hsp27 show elevated levels in all cells of the tumorigenic clone since early stages, which persists till their transformation. However, the stress-inducible Hsp70 is expressd only in a few cells at later stage of established tumorous clones that show high F-actin aggregation. Intriguingly, levels of heat shock factor (HSF), the master regulator of Hsps, remain unaltered in these tumorous cells and its down-regulation does not affect tumorigenic growth of lgl− clones overexpressing Yorkie, although down-regulation of Hsp83 prevents their survival and growth. Interestingly, overexpression of HSF or Hsp83 in lgl− cells makes them competitively successful in establishing tumorous clones. These results show that the major constitutively expressed Hsps, but not the stress-inducible Hsp70, are involved in early as well as late stages of epithelial tumors and their elevated expression in lgl− clones co-overexpressing Yorkie is independent of HSF.

Abstract: Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-associated complication accompanied by gestational hypertension and proteinuria, affecting 2–8% of pregnancies globally. The placental trophoblast cell invasion of decidua and myometrium during early gestation is crucial for healthy placentation. Thus, trophoblast dysfunction might contribute to PE onset. Therefore, further investigations are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of trophoblast cell functions. In the present study, we identified a novel pseudogene named C-Type Lectin Domain Family 4 Member G Pseudogene 1 (CLEC4GP1), which was aberrantly expressed in PE placental tissues. In vitro analyses showed that CLEC4GP1 overexpression significantly increased the cell viability and invasiveness and decreased the apoptosis rate of HTR-8/SVneo and JEG-3 cells, while CLEC4GP1 knockdown exerted opposite effects, suggesting the beneficial role of CLEC4GP1 in trophoblast cells. Next, co-expression analysis found that CLEC4GP1 was negatively correlated with Interleukin 15 (IL-15). The expression of IL-15 dramatically increased in PE placental tissues. In HTR-8/SVneo and JEG-3 cells, IL-15 exhibited detrimental effects, opposite to CLEC4GP1, and they were negatively correlated. In addition, CLEC4GP1 attenuates the mRNA stability of IL-16 by inhibiting the binding between human antigen R (HuR) protein and IL-15 RNA. Finally, the obverse effects of CLEC4GP1 and IL-15 were investigated, and results showed that IL-15 reverted CLEC4GP1 induced cellular functions. In brief, these data suggest that CLEC4GP1/IL-15 axis might modulate the occurrence and progression of PE via influencing the trophoblast cell viability, apoptosis, and invasive capability. This study provided cognizance of targeting the CLEC4GP1/IL-15 axis as a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate PE progression.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting mitophagy to activate the recycling of faulty mitochondria during aging is a strategy to mitigate muscle decline. We present results from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in middle-aged adults where we administer a postbiotic compound Urolithin A (Mitopure), a known mitophagy activator, at two doses for 4 months (NCT03464500). The data show significant improvements in muscle strength (∼12%) with intake of Urolithin A. We observe clinically meaningful improvements with Urolithin A on aerobic endurance (peak oxygen oxygen consumption [VO2]) and physical performance (6 min walk test) but do not notice a significant improvement on peak power output (primary endpoint). Levels of plasma acylcarnitines and C-reactive proteins are significantly lower with Urolithin A, indicating higher mitochondrial efficiency and reduced inflammation. We also examine expression of proteins linked to mitophagy and mitochondrial metabolism in skeletal muscle and find a significant increase with Urolithin A administration. This study highlights the benefit of Urolithin A to improve muscle performance.

Abstract: Whether and how sevoflurane preconditioning (SevoPre) exerts protection against acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury remains elusive. We observed significant myocardial injury, as evidenced by infarct size, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and circulating troponin-I, at 3 h of MI/R in both wildtype and adiponectin knockout mice. The injury was significantly ameliorated by SevoPre in wildtype mice, but not in adiponectin knockout mice. In wildtype mice, we found that MI/R could increase endoplasmic reticulum stress of cardiomyocytes, and impair association of adiponectin receptor 1 and ceveolin-3, both of which processes were largely restored by SevoPre. In summary, we demonstrated that significant injury had already took place at 3 h of MI/R, which could be ameliorated by SevoPre via promoting affinity of adiponectin receptor 1 and ceveolin-3, and then attenuating endoplasmic reticulum stress of cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is well known as a highly aggressive brain tumor subtype. Here, we show that overexpression (OE) of dematin actin-binding protein (DMTN) inhibits GBM proliferation and invasion by affecting cell cycle regulation and actin remodeling, respectively. RT–qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining demonstrated a significant reduction in DMTN expression in gliomas, especially in high-grade gliomas (HGG) compared with normal brains, which correlates with worse survival in HGG patients. Functional studies revealed inhibitory effects of DMTN on tumor proliferation and migratory capacities. The attenuation in tumor proliferative ability upon DMTN OE was accompanied by RhoA suppression and CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and cyclin D1 downregulation, while RhoA rescue restored the proliferative phenotype. Meanwhile, overexpression of DMTN produced profoundly disorganized stress fibers, which led to impaired tumor invasion. Furthermore, DMTN overexpression produced substantial suppression of tumor growth upon subcutaneous and intracranial implantation in mice, and this was accompanied by significantly reduced vinculin expression and Ki67 positivity. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the role of DMTN in regulating GBM cell proliferation, actin cytoskeleton, and cell morphology and identify DMTN as a vital tumor suppressor in GBM progression.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoiesis is maintained by functionally diverse lineage-biased hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The functional significance of HSC heterogeneity and the regulatory mechanisms underlying lineage bias are not well understood. However, absolute purification of HSC subtypes with a pre-determined behavior remains challenging, highlighting the importance of continued efforts toward prospective isolation of homogeneous HSC subsets. In this study, we demonstrate that CD49b subdivides the most primitive HSC compartment into functionally distinct subtypes: CD49b− HSCs are highly enriched for myeloid-biased and the most durable cells, while CD49b+ HSCs are enriched for multipotent cells with lymphoid bias and reduced self-renewal ability. We further demonstrate considerable transcriptional similarities between CD49b− and CD49b+ HSCs but distinct differences in chromatin accessibility. Our studies highlight the diversity of HSC functional behaviors and provide insights into the molecular regulation of HSC heterogeneity through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
For regenerative cell therapies using pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived cells, large quantities of purified cells are required. Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) is a powerful approach to collect target antigen-positive cells; however, it remains a challenge to purify various cell types efficiently at large scale without using antibodies specific to the desired cell type. Here we develop a technology that combines microRNA (miRNA)-responsive mRNA switch (miR-switch) with MACS (miR-switch-MACS) to purify large amounts of PSC-derived cells rapidly and effectively. We designed miR-switches that detect specific miRNAs expressed in target cells and controlled the translation of a CD4-coding transgene as a selection marker for MACS. For the large-scale purification of induced PSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), we transferred miR-208a-CD4 switch-MACS and obtained purified iPSC-CMs efficiently. Moreover, miR-375-CD4 switch-MACS highly purified pancreatic insulin-producing cells and their progenitors expressing Chromogranin A. Overall, the miR-switch-MACS method can efficiently purify target PSC-derived cells for cell replacement therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The chemotherapy resistance of esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs) is underpinned by cancer cell extrinsic mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment (TME). We demonstrate that, by targeting the tumor-promoting functions of the predominant TME cell type, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i), we can enhance the efficacy of standard-of-care chemotherapy. In ex vivo conditions, PDE5i prevent the transdifferentiation of normal fibroblasts to CAF and abolish the tumor-promoting function of established EAC CAFs. Using shotgun proteomics and single-cell RNA-seq, we reveal PDE5i-specific regulation of pathways related to fibroblast activation and tumor promotion. Finally, we confirm the efficacy of PDE5i in combination with chemotherapy in close-to-patient and in vivo PDX-based model systems. These findings demonstrate that CAFs drive chemotherapy resistance in EACs and can be targeted by repurposing PDE5i, a safe and well-tolerated class of drug administered to millions of patients world-wide to treat erectile dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a cancer-associated pathogen responsible for 165,000 deaths annually. EBV is also the etiological agent of infectious mononucleosis and is linked to multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, an EBV vaccine would have a significant global health impact. EBV is orally transmitted and has tropism for epithelial and B cells. Therefore, a vaccine would need to prevent infection of both in the oral cavity. Passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies against the gH/gL glycoprotein complex prevent experimental EBV infection in humanized mice and rhesus macaques, suggesting that gH/gL is an attractive vaccine candidate. Here, we evaluate the immunogenicity of several gH/gL nanoparticle vaccines. All display superior immunogenicity relative to monomeric gH/gL. A nanoparticle displaying 60 copies of gH/gL elicits antibodies that protect against lethal EBV challenge in humanized mice, whereas antibodies elicited by monomeric gH/gL do not. These data motivate further development of gH/gL nanoparticle vaccines for EBV.

Abstract: Summary
When corneal epithelial stem cells residing in the corneal limbus become dysfunctional, called a limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), corneal transparency is decreased, causing severe vision loss. Transplantation of corneal epithelial cell sheets (CEPS) derived from stem cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells, is a promising treatment for LSCD. However, the potential effect of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) concordance on CEPS transplantation has not been addressed. Here, we show that there is no difference in the immune response to CEPS between HLA-matched and -unmatched peripheral blood mononuclear cells in mixed lymphocyte reactions. CEPS transplantation in cynomolgus monkeys revealed that the immune response to major histocompatibility-unmatched CEPS was not strong and could be controlled by local steroid administration. Furthermore, programmed death ligand 1 was identified as an immunosuppressive molecule in CEPS under inflammatory conditions in vitro. Our results indicate that corneal epithelium has low immunogenicity and allogeneic CEPS transplantation requires mild immunosuppression.

Abstract: Summary
Microbially-derived gut metabolites are important contributors to host phenotypes, many of which may link microbiome composition to metabolic disease. However, relatively few metabolites with known bioactivity have been traced from specific microbes to host tissues. Here, we use a labeling strategy to characterize and trace bacterial sphingolipids from the gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to mouse colons and livers. We find that bacterial sphingolipid synthesis rescues excess lipid accumulation in a mouse model of hepatic steatosis and observe the transit of a previously uncharacterized bacterial sphingolipid to the liver. The addition of this sphingolipid to hepatocytes improves respiration in response to fatty-acid overload, suggesting that sphingolipid transfer to the liver could potentially contribute to microbiota-mediated liver function. This work establishes a role for bacterial sphingolipids in modulating hepatic phenotypes and defines a workflow that permits the characterization of other microbial metabolites with undefined functions in host health.

Abstract: Aim
The molecular mechanism of differentiation in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) preserves to be further elucidated. LncRNA HOTTIP has been proven to accelerate osteogenic differentiation, but the regulation mechanism is still unclear.
Methods
The human BMSCs (hBMSCs) were isolated and identified by the antigen CD29, CD34, CD44, CD45, and CD90 through flow cytometry. The osteogenic state was determined by the ALP Detection Kit and Alizarin red staining. The tube formation was observed under a microscope. HOTTIP expression level, DLX2 and TAF15, Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and transcriptional markers in osteogenesis and angiogenesis were examined with Western blot and RT-qPCR, respectively. The combination of TAF15 with lncRNA HOTTIP and DLX2 was detected by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pulldown assays.
Results
The outcomes revealed that HOTTIP was noticeably up-regulated accompanied by the osteogenic transcriptional factor in the process of osteoblast differentiation and angiogenesis. Besides, HOTTIP enhanced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, accelerated osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis along with up-regulation of osteogenic and angiogenic-related gene expression, by interaction with TAF15 to stabilize DLX2.
Conclusion
Taken together, our outcomes reveal that lncRNA HOTTIP accelerated osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis by interaction with TAF15 to stabilize DLX2.

Abstract: Indigo is a bis-indolic alkaloid that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects reported in literature and is a promissory compound for treating chronic inflammatory diseases. This fact prompted to investigate the effects of this alkaloid in the experimental model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the potential role of the indigo on oxidative stress and related signaling pathways in primary skeletal muscle cell cultures and in the diaphragm muscle from mdx mice. The MTT and Neutral Red assays showed no indigo dose-dependent toxicities in mdx muscle cells at concentrations analyzed (3.12, 6.25, 12.50, and 25.00 μg/mL). Antioxidant effect of indigo, in mdx muscle cells and diaphragm muscle, was demonstrated by reduction in 4-HNE content, H2O2 levels, DHE reaction, and lipofuscin granules. A significant decrease in the inflammatory process was identified by a reduction on TNF and NF-κB levels, on inflammatory area, and on macrophage infiltration in the dystrophic sample, after indigo treatment. Upregulation of PGC-1α and SIRT1 in dystrophic muscle cells treated with indigo was also observed. These results suggest the potential of indigo as a therapeutic agent for muscular dystrophy, through their action anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and modulator of SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway.

Abstract: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a highly lethal malignant gastrointestinal tumor. Sparstolonin B is an isocoumarin whose anticancer activity has recently received increasing attention. This study aimed to investigate Sparstolonin B's potential antitumor effect on pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The effect of Sparstolonin B on pancreatic cancer target genes and molecular mechanism was predicted via network pharmacology; Sparstolonin B significantly decreased Panc-1 and SW1990 cell viability and effectively suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells as shown by CCK-8, colony formation, and Transwell assays. Flow cytometry showed that it induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Sparstolonin B also upregulated Bax levels but decreased those of MMP2 and Bcl-2, downregulated IκBα expression, and upregulated p65 and IκBα phosphorylation; however, it had no effect on total NF-κB p65 levels. The NF-κB pathway inhibitor QNZ reversed these effects. The treatment group (26 μmol/L) had reduced graft volume and weight and fewer Ki-67-positive cells than the control group. Therefore, Sparstolonin B can inhibit the growth and induce the apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells via the NF-κB signaling pathway and may be a potential novel drug for pancreatic cancer treatment.
