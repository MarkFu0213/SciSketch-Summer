Abstract: Few studies have focused on the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) after chronic heat stress. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of chronic high temperature–humidity index treatment on the expressions of HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, HSPA2 and HSC70, in the Rex rabbit testis and the expressions of these proteins after recovery from the chronic heat shock. Thirty mature male rabbits of the same age were randomly divided into three groups: control, heat stress, and recovery. The western blot results showed that the expressional levels of HSP60, HSP90, and HSC70 increased significantly and HSPA2 was elevated slightly after a 9-week heat treatment. HSP70 was absent in the control testis and had a high level of expression after heat stress. All of these proteins partially reverted back to normal levels after a 9-week recovery. The immunohistochemical results indicated that the expression patterns of HSP60, HSP90, HSPA2, and HSC70 did not change.

Abstract: The PI3K-AKT pathway is frequently activated in human cancers, including breast cancer, and its activation appears to be critical for tumor maintenance. Some malignant cells are dependent on activated AKT for their survival; tumors exhibiting elevated AKT activity show sensitivity to its inhibition, providing an Achilles heel for their treatment. Here we show that the PKCη isoform is a negative regulator of the AKT signaling pathway. The IGF-I induced phosphorylation on Ser473 of AKT was inhibited by the PKCη-induced expression in MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cancer cells. This was further confirmed in shRNA PKCη-knocked-down MCF-7 cells, demonstrating elevated phosphorylation on AKT Ser473. While PKCη exhibited negative regulation on AKT phosphorylation it did not alter the IGF-I induced ERK phosphorylation. However, it enhanced ERK phosphorylation when stimulated by PDGF. Moreover, its effects on IGF-I/AKT and PDGF/ERK pathways were in correlation with cell proliferation. We further show that both PKCη and IGF-I confer protection against UV-induced apoptosis and cell death having additive effects. Although the protective effect of IGF-I involved activation of AKT, it was not affected by PKCη expression, suggesting that PKCη acts through a different route to increase cell survival. Hence, our studies show that PKCη provides negative control on AKT pathway leading to reduced cell proliferation, and further suggest that its presence/absence in breast cancer cells will affect cell death, which could be of therapeutic value.

Abstract: Intravascular delivery of cells has been increasingly used in stroke models and clinical trials. We compared the biodistribution and therapeutic effects of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) delivered by intra-arterial (IA) or intravenous (IV) injection after cortical ischemia. For the biodistribution analyses, BMMCs were labeled with 99mTechnetium (99mTc). At 2h, gamma-well counting of the brain and of the other organs evaluated did not show differences between the non-ischemic and ischemic groups or between injection routes, and the organs with the highest uptake were the liver and lungs, with low uptake in the brain. At 24h, the liver maintained the highest activity, and a marked decrease was seen in pulmonary uptake in all groups. At this time point, although the activity in the brain remained low, the lesioned hemisphere showed greater homing than the contralateral hemisphere, for both the IV and IA ischemic groups. Histological analysis by CellTrace labeling indicated similar homing between both routes in the peri-infarct region 24h after transplantation and functional recovery was observed in both groups up to 11weeks after the lesion. In conclusion, transplantation of BMMCs by IA or IV routes may lead to similar brain homing and therapeutic efficacy after experimental stroke.

Abstract: Summary
Phytopathogens can manipulate plant hormone signaling to access nutrients and counteract defense responses. Pseudomonas syringae produces coronatine, a toxin that mimics the plant hormone jasmonic acid isoleucine and promotes opening of stomata for bacterial entry, bacterial growth in the apoplast, systemic susceptibility, and disease symptoms. We examined the mechanisms underlying coronatine-mediated virulence and show that coronatine activates three homologous NAC transcription factor (TF) genes, ANAC019, ANAC055, and ANAC072, through direct activity of the TF, MYC2. Genetic characterization of NAC TF mutants demonstrates that these TFs mediate coronatine-induced stomatal reopening and bacterial propagation in both local and systemic tissues by inhibiting the accumulation of the key plant immune signal salicylic acid (SA). These NAC TFs exert this inhibitory effect by repressing ICS1 and activating BSMT1, genes involved in SA biosynthesis and metabolism, respectively. Thus, a signaling cascade by which coronatine confers its multiple virulence activities has been elucidated.

Abstract: In proliferating mammalian cells, DNA damage is detected by sensors that elicit a cellular response which arrests the cell cycle and repairs the damage. As part of the DNA damage response, DNA replication is inhibited and, within seconds, histone H2AX is phosphorylated. Here we describe a cell-free system that reconstitutes the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks using damage-activated cell extracts and naïve nuclei. Using this system the effect of damage signalling on nuclei that do not contain DNA lesions can be studied, thereby uncoupling signalling and repair. Soluble extracts from G1/S phase cells that were treated with etoposide before isolation, or pre-incubated with nuclei from etoposide-treated cells during an in vitro activation reaction, restrain both initiation and elongation of DNA replication in naïve nuclei. At the same time, H2AX is phosphorylated in naïve nuclei in a manner that is dependent upon the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinases. Notably, phosphorylated H2AX is not focal in naïve nuclei, but is evident throughout the nucleus suggesting that in the absence of DNA lesions the signal is not amplified such that discrete foci can be detected. This system offers a novel screening approach for inhibitors of DNA damage response kinases, which we demonstrate using the inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002.

Abstract: Summary
The Helicobacter pylori type IV secretion effector CagA is a major bacterial virulence determinant and critical for gastric carcinogenesis. Upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells, CagA localizes to the inner face of the plasma membrane, where it acts as a pathogenic scaffold/hub that promiscuously recruits host proteins to potentiate oncogenic signaling. We find that CagA comprises a structured N-terminal region and an intrinsically disordered C-terminal region that directs versatile protein interactions. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the N-terminal CagA fragment (residues 1-876) revealed that the region has a structure comprised of three discrete domains. Domain I constitutes a mobile CagA N terminus, while Domain II tethers CagA to the plasma membrane by interacting with membrane phosphatidylserine. Domain III interacts intramolecularly with the intrinsically disordered C-terminal region, and this interaction potentiates the pathogenic scaffold/hub function of CagA. The present work provides a tertiary-structural basis for the pathophysiological/oncogenic action of H. pylori CagA.

Abstract: The recent introduction of technologies capable of reprogramming human somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells offers a unique opportunity to study many aspects of neurodegenerative diseases in vitro that could ultimately lead to novel drug development and testing. Here, we report for the first time that human dermal fibroblasts from a patient with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS) were reprogrammed to pluripotency by retroviral transduction using defined factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC). The MSiPS cell lines resembled human embryonic stem (hES) cell-like colonies in morphology and gene expression and exhibited silencing of the retroviral transgenes after four passages. MSiPS cells formed embryoid bodies that expressed markers of all three germ layers by immunostaining and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR. The injection of undifferentiated iPS cell colonies into immunodeficient mice formed teratomas, thereby demonstrating pluripotency. The MSiPS cells were successfully differentiated into mature astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons with normal karyotypes. Although MSiPS-derived neurons displayed some differences in their electrophysiological characteristics as compared to the control cell line, they exhibit properties of functional neurons, with robust resting membrane potentials, large fast tetrodotoxin-sensitive action potentials and voltage-gated sodium currents. This study provides for the first time proof of concept that disease cell lines derived from skin cells obtained from an MS patient can be generated and successfully differentiated into mature neural lineages. This represents an important step in a novel approach for the study of MS pathophysiology and potential drug discovery.

Abstract: Long-term reconstituting hematopoietic stem cells first arise from the aorta of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region in a mouse embryo. We have previously reported that in cultures of the dispersed AGM region, CD45lowc-Kit+ cells possess the ability to reconstitute multilineage hematopoietic cells, but investigations are needed to show that this is not a cultured artifact and to clarify when and how this population is present. Based on the expression profile of CD45 and c-Kit in freshly dissociated AGM cells from embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) to E12.5 and aorta cells in the AGM from E13.5 to E15.5, we defined six cell populations (CD45−c-Kit−, CD45−c-Kitlow, CD45−c-Kithigh, CD45lowc-Kithigh, CD45highc-Kithigh, and CD45highc-Kitvery low). Among these six populations, CD45lowc-Kithigh cells were most able to form hematopoietic cell colonies, but their ability decreased after E11.5 and was undetectable at E13.5 and later. The CD45lowc-Kithigh cells showed multipotency in vitro. We demonstrated further enrichment of hematopoietic activity in the Hoechst dye-effluxing side population among the CD45lowc-Kithigh cells. Here, we determined that CD45lowc-Kithigh cells arise from the lateral plate mesoderm using embryonic stem cell-derived differentiation system. In conclusion, CD45lowc-Kithigh cells are the major hematopoietic cells of mouse AGM.

Abstract: Embryonic stem cell-associated antigens are expressed in a variety of adult stem cells as well as embryonic stem cells. In the present study, we investigated whether stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-4 can be used to isolate dental pulp (DP) stem cells. DP cells showed plastic adherence, specific surface antigen expression, and multipotent differentiation potential, similar to mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). SSEA-4+ cells were found in cultured DP cells in vitro as well as in DP tissue in vivo. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that 45.5% of the DP cells were SSEA-4+. When the DP cells were cultured in the presence of all-trans-retinoic acid, marked downregulation of SSEA-3 and SSEA-4 and the upregulation of SSEA-1 were observed. SSEA-4+ DP cells showed a greater telomere length and a higher growth rate compared to ungated and SSEA-4− cells. A clonal assay demonstrated that 65.5% of the SSEA-4+ DP cells had osteogenic potential, and the SSEA-4+ clonal DP cells showed multilineage differentiation potential toward osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and neurons in vitro. In addition, the SSEA-4+ DP cells had the capacity to form ectopic bone in vivo. Thus, our results suggest that SSEA-4 is a specific cell surface antigen that can be used to identify DP stem cells.

Abstract: p53, the major human tumor suppressor, appears to be related to sonic hedgehog (Shh)–Gli-mediated tumorigenesis. However, the role of p53 in tumor progression by the Shh–Gli signaling pathway is poorly understood. Herein we investigated the critical regulation of Gli3–p53 in tumorigenesis of colon cancer cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the mRNA level of Shh and Gli3 in colon tumor tissues was significantly higher than corresponding normal tissues (P<0.001). The inhibition of Gli3 by treatment with Gli3 siRNA resulted in a clear decrease in cell proliferation and enhanced the level of expression of p53 proteins compared to treatment with control siRNA. The half-life of p53 was dramatically increased by treatment with Gli3 siRNA. In addition, treatment with MG132 blocked MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation, and led to accumulation of p53 in Gli3 siRNA-overexpressing cells. Importantly, ectopic expression of p53 siRNA reduced the ability of Gli3 siRNA to suppress proliferation of those cells compared with the cells treated with Gli3 siRNA alone. Moreover, Gli3 siRNA sensitized colon cancer cells to treatment with anti-cancer agents (5-FU and bevacizumab). Taken together, our studies demonstrate that loss of Gli3 signaling leads to disruption of the MDM2–p53 interaction and strongly potentiate p53-dependent cell growth inhibition in colon cancer cells, indicating a basis for the rational use of Gli3 antagonists as a novel treatment option for colon cancer.

Abstract: There is emerging evidence that human solid tumor cells originate from cancer stem cells (CSCs). In cancer cell lines, tumor-initiating CSCs are mainly found in the side population (SP) that has the capacity to extrude dyes such as Hoechst 33342. We found that Nanog is expressed specifically in SP cells of human gastrointestinal (GI) cancer cells. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that NanogP8 but not Nanog was expressed in GI cancer cells. Transfection of NanogP8 into GI cancer cell lines promoted cell proliferation, while its inhibition by anti-Nanog siRNA suppressed the proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining of primary GI cancer tissues revealed NanogP8 protein to be strongly expressed in 3 out of 60 cases. In these cases, NanogP8 was found especially in an infiltrative part of the tumor, in proliferating cells with Ki67 expression. These data suggest that NanogP8 is involved in GI cancer development in a fraction of patients, in whom it presumably acts by supporting CSC proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogens commonly disrupt host cell processes or cause damage, but the surveillance mechanisms used by animals to monitor these attacks are poorly understood. Upon infection with pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the nematode C. elegans upregulates infection response gene irg-1 using the zip-2 bZIP transcription factor. Here we show that P. aeruginosa infection inhibits mRNA translation in the intestine via the endocytosed translation inhibitor Exotoxin A, which leads to an increase in ZIP-2 protein levels. In the absence of infection we find that the zip-2/irg-1 pathway is upregulated following disruption of several core host processes, including inhibition of mRNA translation. ZIP-2 induction is conferred by a conserved upstream open reading frame in zip-2 that could derepress ZIP-2 translation upon infection. Thus, translational inhibition, a common pathogenic strategy, can trigger activation of an immune surveillance pathway to provide host defense.

Abstract: Co-culture of periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts and SCC-25 oral squamous carcinoma cells (OSCC), results in conversion of PDLs into carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Paracrin circuits between CAFs and OSCC cells were hypothesized to regulate the gene expression of matrix remodeling enzymes in their co-culture, which was performed for 7days, followed by analysis of the mRNA/protein expression and activity of metalloproteinases (MMPs), their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) and other relevant genes. Interleukin1-β, transforming growth factor-β1, fibronectin and αvβ6 integrin have shown to be involved in the regulation of the MMP and TIMP gene expression in co-culture of CAFs and tumor cells. In addition, these cells also cooperated in activation of MMP pro-enzymes. It is particularly interesting that the fibroblast-produced inactive MMP-2 has been activated by the tumor-cell-produced membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). The crosstalk between cancer- and the surrounding fibroblast stromal-cells is essential for the fine tuning of cancer cells invasivity.

Abstract: Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a multifunctional protein involved in transcriptional control, pre-mRNA processing, RNA transport and translation. The domain structure of FUS reflects its functions in gene regulation and its ability to interact with other proteins, RNA and DNA. By use of a recombinant fragment of FUS in pull-down experiments followed by mass spectrometry analysis we have identified a novel interaction between the FUS N-terminal and the cytolinker plectin. An in situ proximity ligation assay confirmed that FUS-plectin interactions take place in the cytoplasm of cells. Furthermore, plectin deficient cells showed an altered subcellular localization of FUS and a deregulated expression of mRNAs bound to FUS. Our results show that plectin is important for normal FUS localization and function. Mutations involving FUS are causative factors in sarcomas and leukemias and also hereditary forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Plectin deficiency causes epidermolysis bullosa, a disease involving the skin and neuromuscular system. The novel FUS-plectin interaction offers new perspectives for understanding the role of FUS and plectin mutations in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

Abstract: Lipoxygenases oxidatively metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids to a rich spectrum of biologically active metabolites. The present study aimed at delineating the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms leading to 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) expression in the Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cell line L1236. Examination of the 15-LOX-1 5′ promoter region demonstrated three putative binding sites for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT6) within the proximal 1200 base pairs relative to the start codon. Analysis by serial promoter deletions and STAT6 binding site mutations indicated that all three STAT6 binding sites are required for full activation of the 15-LOX-1 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that these regions were occupied by STAT6 in L1236 (15-LOX-1 positive) but not in L428 (15-LOX-1 negative) cultured HL cells. Furthermore, DNA hypomethylation and histone hyperacetylation were detectable within the core promoter region of 15-LOX-1 only in L1236 cells but not L428 cells. Taken together, our data indicate that STAT6 activation and chromatin remodeling by DNA demethylation and histone acetylation are crucial for transcriptional activation of 15-LOX-1 in cultured HL cells. These prerequisites are fulfilled in the L1236 cell line, but not in the L428 cell line.

Abstract: Inflammation in older persons is associated with frailty, cachexia, and disability. We hypothesized that NSAID treatment in addition to antibiotics in older patients with acute infection might rapidly reduce inflammatory cytokines and might be of therapeutic potential to improve outcomes. A double-blind controlled trial was conducted in geriatric patients admitted for acute infection. Patients were randomized to receive either 10 mg piroxicam or placebo. Patients ≥70 years with CRP levels >10 mg/L of acute infectious origin were eligible. Twenty-five cyto-/chemokines as well as heat shock proteins Hsp27 (HSPB1) and Hsp70 (HSPA1A) were measured the first 4 days and then weekly until discharge, with a maximum of 3 weeks. Thirty Caucasian patients were included (median age 84.5 years, 67% female, median CRP 87.5 mg/L). In the piroxicam group, IL-6 and IP-10/CXCL10 decreased significantly during the study period. Relationships between cytokines were disrupted in the piroxicam group: for 12 out of 20 cytokines the number of correlations between changes in serum levels was significantly lower compared to placebo. Serum Hsp70 levels decreased significantly in the piroxicam group, but not in the placebo group. Without heat challenge, intracellular levels of Hsp70 in monocytes decreased in both groups, whereas HsP27 in monocytes increased with piroxicam with a significant difference compared to placebo at 3 weeks. Piroxicam in this setting cannot be considered merely as an anti-inflammatory drug, but rather as an immunomodulator. Further studies are needed to establish whether these effects can change functional outcomes in geriatric patients.

Cells secrete cytokine as a latent complex that must be activated for it to exert its biological functions. We previously discovered that the epithelial-restricted integrin αvβ6 activates TGF-β and that this process is important in a number of in vivo models of disease. Here, we show that agonists of G-protein coupled receptors (Sphingosine-1-Phosphate and Lysophosphatidic Acid) which are ligated under conditions of epithelial injury directly stimulate primary airway epithelial cells to activate latent TGF-β through a pathway that involves Rho Kinase, non-muscle myosin, the αvβ6 integrin, and the generation of mechanical tension. Interestingly, lung epithelial cells appear to exert force on latent TGF-β using sub-cortical actin/myosin rather than the stress fibers utilized by fibroblasts and other traditionally “contractile” cells. These findings extend recent evidence suggesting TGF-β can be activated by integrin-mediated mechanical force and suggest that this mechanism is important for an integrin (αvβ6) and a cell type (epithelial cells) that have important roles in biologically relevant TGF-β activation in vivo.

Abstract: During wound healing, fibroblasts transition from quiescence to a migratory state, then to a contractile myofibroblast state associated with wound closure. We found that the myofibroblast phenotype, characterized by the expression of high levels of contractile proteins, suppresses the expression of the pro-migratory gene, MMP-2. Fibroblasts cultured in a 3-D collagen lattice and allowed to develop tension showed increased contractile protein expression and decreased MMP-2 levels in comparison to a stress-released lattice. In 2-D cultures, factors that promote fibroblast contractility, including serum or TGF-β, down-regulated MMP-2. Pharmacologically inducing F-actin disassembly or reduced contractility increased MMP-2 expression, while conditions that promote F-actin assembly suppressed MMP-2 expression. In all cases, changes in MMP-2 levels were inversely related to changes in the contractile marker, smooth muscle α-actin. To determine if the mechanisms involved in contractile protein gene expression play a direct role in MMP-2 regulation, we used RNAi-mediated knock-down of the myocardin-like factors, MRTF-A and MRTF-B, which induced the down-regulation of contractile protein genes by fibroblasts under both serum-containing and serum-free conditions. In the presence of serum or TGF-β, MRTF-A/B knock-down resulted in the up-regulation of MMP-2; serum-free conditions prevented this increased expression. Together, these results indicate that, while MMP-2 expression is suppressed by F-actin formation, its up-regulation is not simply a consequence of contractile protein down-regulation.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate whether transmyocardial drilling revascularization combined with heparinized basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-incorporating degradable stent implantation (TMDRSI) can promote myocardial regeneration after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
Methods
A model of AMI was generated by ligating the mid-third of left anterior descending artery (LAD) of miniswine. After 6h, the animals were divided into none-treatment (control) group (n=6) and TMDRSI group (n=6). For TMDRSI group, two channels with 3.5mm in diameter were established by a self-made drill in the AMI region, into which a stent was implanted. Expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), cardiac stem cell (CSC)-mediated myocardial regeneration, myocardial apoptosis, myocardial viability, and cardiac function were assessed at various time-points.
Results
Six weeks after the operation, CSCs were found to have differentiated into cardiomyocytes to repair the infarcted myocardium, and all above indices showed much improvement in the TMDRSI group compared with the control group (P<0.001).
Conclusions
The new method has shown to be capable of promoting CSCs proliferation and differentiation into cardiomyocytes through activating the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, while inhibiting myocardial apoptosis, thereby enhancing myocardial regeneration following AMI and improving cardiac function. This may provide a new strategy for myocardial regeneration following AMI.

Abstract: Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a crucial regulator of cell fate in response to genotoxic stress. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation plays important roles in multiple cellular processes, including DNA repair, chromosomal stability, chromatin function, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) degradation is carried out mainly by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) enzymes. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is a known human carcinogen. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that exposure to BaP caused a concentration-dependent DNA damage in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. The role of PARG in the regulation of DNA damage induced by BaP is still unclear. To gain insight into the function of PARG and PAR in response to BaP, we used lentiviral gene silencing to generate 16HBE cell lines with stably suppressed PARG, and determined parameters of cell death and cell cycle following BaP exposure. We found that PARG was partially dependent on PAR synthesis, PARG depletion led to PAR accumulation. BaP-induced cell death was regulated by PARG, the absence of which was beneficial for undamaged cells. Our results further suggested that PARG probably has influence on ATM/p53 pathway and metabolic activation of BaP. Experimental evidences provided from this study suggest significant preventive properties of PAR accumulation in the toxicity caused by BaP.

Abstract: Hyaluronic acid (HA) is one of the main components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and is expressed throughout the body including the lung and mostly in areas surrounding proliferating and migrating cells. Furthermore, platelets have been implicated as important players in the airway remodelling process, e.g. due to their ability to induce airway smooth muscle cell (ASMC) proliferation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of HA, the HA-binding surface receptor CD44 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in platelet-induced ASMC proliferation. Proliferation of ASMC was measured using the MTS-assay, and we found that the CD44 blocking antibody and the HA synthase inhibitor 4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU) significantly inhibited platelet-induced ASMC proliferation. The interaction between ASMC and platelets was studied by fluorescent staining of F-actin. In addition, the ability of ASMC to synthesise HA was investigated by fluorescent staining using biotinylated HA-binding protein and a streptavidin conjugate. We observed that ASMC produced HA and that a CD44 blocking antibody and 4-MU significantly inhibited platelet binding to the area surrounding the ASMC. Furthermore, the FAK-inhibitor PF 573228 inhibited platelet-induced ASMC proliferation. Co-culture of ASMC and platelets also resulted in increased phosphorylation of FAK as detected by Western blot analysis. In addition, 4-MU significantly inhibited the increased FAK-phosphorylation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that ECM has the ability to influence platelet-induced ASMC proliferation. Specifically, we propose that HA produced by ASMC is recognised by platelet CD44. The platelet/HA interaction is followed by FAK activation and increased proliferation of co-cultured ASMC. We also suggest that the mitogenic effect of platelets represents a potential important and novel mechanism that may contribute to airway remodelling.

Abstract: Antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and peroxiredoxin (Prx), are essential components in cells to eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). GPx, CAT, and Prx genes have been reported in penaeid shrimp, and they showed different expression profiles at transcription or protein level when shrimps were challenged by microbes. In order to learn the relationship among the above three genes in their function, GPx, CAT, and Prx transcripts were analyzed, and the variation of GPx and CAT enzyme activity was detected when shrimp was injected with H2O2 or one antioxidant enzyme gene was silenced in shrimp by double-strand RNA injection. The results indicated that there existed some relationships among three antioxidant enzyme genes, CAT, GPx, and Prx in shrimp at transcriptional level. The transcription of CAT and GPx could be directly induced by H2O2 injection, while the transcription of Prx cannot be induced by H2O2. Decreased transcription level of CAT or GPx could lead to increased transcription of the other two genes, which suggested that there existed some compensation among these three antioxidant enzyme genes. These data can help us to understand the roles of antioxidant enzymes in crustacean.

Abstract: There are two different Angiotensin II (ANG II) peptides in nature: Human type (ANG II) and Bovine type (ANG II*). These eight amino acid peptides differ only at position 5 where Valine is replaced by Isoleucine in the Bovine type. They are present in all species studied so far. These amino acids are different by only one atom of carbon. This difference is so small, that it will allow any of ANG II, Bovine or Human antibodies to interact with all species and create a universal method for apoptosis detection. ANG II concentrations are found at substantially higher levels in apoptotic, compared to non-apoptotic, tissues. ANG II accumulation can lead to DNA damage, mutations, carcinogenesis and cell death. We demonstrate that Bovine antiserum can be used for universal detection of apoptosis. In 2010, the worldwide market for apoptosis detection reached the $20billion mark and significantly increases each year. Most commercially available methods are related to Annexin V and TUNNEL. Our new method based on ANG II is more widely known to physicians and scientists compared to previously used methods. Our approach offers a novel alternative for assessing apoptosis activity with enhanced sensitivity, at a lower cost and ease of use.

Abstract: Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal disease characterized by the premature onset of several age-associated pathologies. The protein defective in WS patients (WRN) is a helicase/exonuclease involved in DNA repair, replication, transcription and telomere maintenance. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a decisive element for the transcriptional regulation of genes essential for adaptation to low oxygen conditions. HIF-1 is also implicated in the molecular mechanisms of ageing. Here, we show that the cellular depletion of WRN protein (by siRNA targeting) leads to increased HIF-1 complex stabilization and activation. HIF-1 activation in the absence of WRN involves the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) since SkQ1, a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, and stigmatellin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex III, blocked increased HIF-1 levels. Ascorbate, an essential co-factor involved in HIF-1 stability, was decreased in WRN-depleted cells. Interestingly, expression levels of GLUT1, a known dehydroascorbic acid transporter, were also decreased in WRN-depleted cells. Ascorbate supplementation of WRN-depleted cells led to a dose-dependent inhibition of HIF-1 activation. These results indicate that WRN protein regulates HIF-1 activation by affecting mitochondrial ROS production and intracellular ascorbate levels. This work provides a novel mechanistic link between HIF-1 activity and different age-associated pathologies.

Abstract: We have previously characterized ubinuclein (Ubn-1) as a NACos (Nuclear and Adherent junction Complex components) protein which interacts with viral or cellular transcription factors and the tight junction (TJ) protein ZO-1. The purpose of the present study was to get more insights on the binding partners of Ubn-1, notably those present in the epithelial junctions. Using an in vivo assay of fluorescent protein-complementation assay (PCA), we demonstrated that the N-terminal domains of the Ubn-1 and ZO-1 proteins triggered a functional interaction inside the cell. Indeed, expression of both complementary fragments of venus fused to the N-terminal parts of Ubn-1 and ZO-1 was able to reconstitute a fluorescent venus protein. Furthermore, nuclear expression of the chimeric Ubn-1 triggered nuclear localization of the chimeric ZO-1. We could localize this interaction to the PDZ2 domain of ZO-1 using an in vitro pull-down assay. More precisely, a 184-amino acid region (from amino acids 39 to 223) at the N-terminal region of Ubn-1 was responsible for the interaction with the PDZ2 domain of ZO-1. Co-imunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy experiments also revealed the tight junction protein cingulin as a new interacting partner of Ubn-1. A proteomic approach based on mass spectrometry analysis (MS) was then undertaken to identify further binding partners of GST-Ubn-1 fusion protein in different subcellular fractions of human epithelial HT29 cells. LYRIC (Lysine-rich CEACAM1-associated protein) and RACK-1 (receptor for activated C-kinase) proteins were validated as bona fide interacting partners of Ubn-1. Altogether, these results suggest that Ubn-1 is a scaffold protein influencing protein subcellular localization and is involved in several processes such as cell–cell contact signalling or modulation of gene activity.

Abstract: Epithelial cells are largely immotile under normal circumstances, but become motile during development, repair of tissue damage and during cancer metastasis. Numerous growth factors act to initiate epithelial cell movements. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induces many epithelial cell lines to begin crawling. A number of small GTPases act downstream of HGF to alter cell shape and promote movement. Arf6 is one of these GTPases that can alter the cortical actin cytoskeleton and promote epithelial movement. Activation of Arf6 in MDCK cells by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor cytohesin 2/ARNO produces a scattering response strikingly reminiscent of the action of HGF. We have previously shown that IPCEF1, a scaffold that binds to cytohesin 2, is required for cytohesin-induced scattering. We report here that IPCEF1 is actually the C-terminal half of CNK3. CNKs are scaffolds involved in signal transduction downstream of Ras. We have found that both MDCK and CaCo-2 cells express a fused CNK3/IPCEF1 protein. Knockdown of this protein impairs HGF-induced Arf6 activation and migration in response to HGF treatment.

Abstract: Bone marrow derived-mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) are multipotent, nonhematopoietic progenitors in a hematopoietic microenvironment and indispensable for regulating hematopoiesis. Several studies have reported that toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to modulate their biological functions. In this study, we investigated the possible role(s) of TLRs in mediating the hematopoiesis-supporting role of human BM-MSCs. Human BM-MSCs were analyzed for mRNA expression of TLR1–10 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. TLR1–6, but not TLR7–10 were expressed by BM-MSCs. The protein expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was also confirmed by flow cytometry. We further explored the role of TLR2 and TLR4 in mediating the capacity of BM-MSCs to support the proliferation and differentiation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells obtained from cord blood. BM-MSCs increased proliferation of CD34+ cells and promoted the differentiation towards the myeloid lineage 7 or 14days after co-culture, as well as colony formation by those cells and the production of interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-8, IL-11, stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF), macrophage CSF and granulocyte-macrophage CSF, if MSCs had been stimulated with TLR2 agonist (PAM3CSK4) or TLR4 agonist (LPS). Interestingly, although these effects were elevated in a different degree, a synergistic effect was not observed in BM-MSCs co-stimulated with PAM3CSK4 and LPS. Together, our findings suggest that TLR2 and TLR4 signaling may indirectly regulate hematopoiesis by modulating BM-MSCs' functions. The increased hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation could be mediated, at least in part, by augmented hematopoiesis-related cytokine production of BM-MSCs.

Abstract: Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune non-scarring hair loss disorder. AA can be acute, recurrent, or chronic. Current therapeutic options for AA are limited, and there is no effective prevention for recurrent AA. We have previously shown a correlation between the expression of HSP70 (HSPA1A/B), a heat shock protein involved in the inflammatory response, and the onset of AA in the C3H/HeJ mouse model. In this study, we tested the effects of quercetin, a bioflavonoid with anti-inflammatory properties, on AA development and HSP70 expression in the C3H/HeJ model. Mice with spontaneous AA were treated with subcutaneous quercetin or sham injections. Hair regrowth was observed in lesional areas in all the quercetin-treated mice, but in none of the sham-treated mice. In addition, non-alopecic C3H/HeJ mice were heat-treated to induce alopecia, along with quercetin or sham injections. Whereas 24% of the heat-treated mice with sham injections developed alopecia, none of the mice receiving quercetin injections did. As expected, the level of HSP70 expression in quercetin-treated areas was comparable to control. Furthermore, we showed that systemic delivery of quercetin by intraperitoneal injections prevented/reduced spontaneous onset of AA. Our results demonstrated that quercetin provided effective treatment for AA as well as prevention of onset of AA in the C3H/HeJ model, and warrant further clinical studies to determine whether quercetin may provide both treatment for preexisting AA and prevention of recurrent AA. The ready availability of quercetin as a dietary supplement may lead to increased patient compliance and positive outcomes for AA.

Abstract: Several epidemiological studies have indicated that abundant consumption of foods from plant origin is associated with a reduced risk of developing several types of cancers. This chemopreventive effect is related to the high content of these foods in phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, that interfere with several processes involved in cancer progression including tumor cell growth, survival and angiogenesis. In addition to the low intake of plant-based foods, increased body mass and physical inactivity have recently emerged as other important lifestyle factors influencing cancer risk, leading to the generation of low-grade chronic inflammatory conditions which are a key process involved in tumor progression. The objectives of the current study are to investigate the inhibitory effects of these polyphenols on angiogenesis triggered by an inflammatory cytokine (IL-6) and to determine the mechanisms underlying this action. We found that, among the tested polyphenols, apigenin and luteolin were the most potent angiogenesis inhibitors through their inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cytokine IL-6/STAT3 pathway. These effects resulted in modulation of the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 signaling triggered by IL-6, as well as in a marked reduction in the proliferation, migration and morphogenic differentiation of endothelial cells. Interestingly, these polyphenols also modulated the expression of IL-6 signal transducing receptor (IL-6Rα) and the secretion of the extracellular matrix degrading enzyme MMP-2 as well as the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS3) protein. Overall, these results may provide important new information on the role of diet in cancer prevention.

Abstract: In the bone marrow cavity, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have been shown to reside in the endosteal and subendosteal perivascular niches, which play specific roles on HSC maintenance. Although cells with long-term ability to reconstitute full hematopoietic system can be isolated from both niches, several data support a heterogenous distribution regarding the cycling behavior of HSC. Whether this distinct behavior depends upon the role played by the stromal populations which distinctly create these two niches is a question that remains open. In the present report, we used our previously described in vivo assay to demonstrate that endosteal and subendosteal stromal populations are very distinct regarding skeletal lineage differentiation potential. This was further supported by a microarray-based analysis, which also demonstrated that these two stromal populations play distinct, albeit complementary, roles in HSC niche. Both stromal populations were preferentially isolated from the trabecular region and behave distinctly in vitro, as previously reported. Even though these two niches are organized in a very close range, in vivo assays and molecular analyses allowed us to identify endosteal stroma (F-OST) cells as fully committed osteoblasts and subendosteal stroma (F-RET) cells as uncommitted mesenchymal cells mainly represented by perivascular reticular cells expressing high levels of chemokine ligand, CXCL12. Interestingly, a number of cytokines and growth factors including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-7, IL-15, Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and stem cell factor (SCF) matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) were also found to be differentially expressed by F-OST and F-RET cells. Further microarray analyses indicated important mechanisms used by the two stromal compartments in order to create and coordinate the “quiescent” and “proliferative” niches in which hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors reside.

Abstract: The Ascl3 transcription factor marks a subset of salivary gland duct cells present in the three major salivary glands of the mouse. In vivo, these cells generate both duct and secretory acinar cell descendants. Here, we have analyzed whether Ascl3-expressing cells retain this multipotent lineage potential in adult glands. Cells isolated from mouse salivary glands were cultured in vitro as non-adherent spheres. Lineage tracing of the Ascl3-expressing cells within the spheres demonstrates that Ascl3+ cells isolated from adult glands remain multipotent, generating both duct and acinar cell types in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the progenitor cells characterized by Keratin 5 expression are an independent population from Ascl3+ progenitor cells. We conclude that the Ascl3+ cells are intermediate lineage-restricted progenitor cells of the adult salivary glands.

Abstract: Metformin is in widespread clinical use for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in patients. It has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial bioenergetic functions by inhibiting complex I of the electron transport chain. The expression of mitochondrial-specific molecular stress protein Hsp60 is a key consequence of mitochondrial impairment. Since this protein has important immune-modulatory properties, we have investigated the expression of Hsp60 in human THP-1 monocyte cells exposed to metformin. In this study, we demonstrate significant up-regulation of Hsp60 at both mRNA and protein levels when these cells were exposed to metformin at therapeutic dosage levels. Interestingly, there was also an increase in expression of CD14 mRNA in these cells. This suggested a possible modulation of the differentiation rates of the THP-1 cells during exposure to metformin. As monocyte differentiation marks a critical step in atherosclerosis, these observations suggest that long-term exposure to metformin could have important implications for the diabetic patient.

Abstract: Abnormal levels of heat shock proteins have been observed in a number of human neoplasms and demonstrate prognostic, predictive and therapeutic implications. Since osteosarcoma (OSA) in dogs provides an important model for the same disease in humans, the aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of Hsp27, Hsp72, Hsp73 and Hsp90 in 18 samples of canine appendicular OSA, in relation to histological grade and overall survival (OS), in order to investigate their potential prognostic, predictive and/or therapeutic value. A semiquantitative method was used for the analysis of the results. Hsp27, Hsp73 and Hsp90 showed a variably intense, cytoplasmic and nuclear immunoreactivity that was not associated with histological type or grade. On the other hand, a high percentage of Hsp72 immunostaining was significantly associated with grade III (P < 0.01) and a lack of immunolabelling was significantly correlated to a longer OS (P = 0.006). Neoplastic emboli were occasionally positive for Hsp27, faintly immunoreactive for Hsp72 and intensely immunolabelled by Hsp73 and Hsp90. In conclusion, absence of Hsp72 immunosignal appears to be associated with a favourable prognosis whilst the widespread Hsp90 immunoreactivity detected in all tumour cases as well as in neoplastic emboli, suggests this protein could be targeted in the therapy of canine OSA, and likewise in its human counterpart.

Abstract: Tissue resident mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to participate in tissue regeneration that follows cell turnover, apoptosis, or necrosis. It has been long known that aging impedes an organism's repair/regeneration capabilities. In order to study the age associated changes, the molecular characteristics of adipose tissue derived MSCs (ASCs) from three age groups of healthy volunteers i.e., young, middle aged, and aged were investigated. The number and multilineage differentiation potential of ASCs declined with age. Aging reduces the proliferative capacity along with increases in cellular senescence. A significant increase in quiescence of G2 and S phase was observed in ASCs from aged donors. The expression of genes related to senescence such as CHEK1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16ink4a was increased with age, however genes of apoptosis were downregulated. Further, an age-dependent abnormality in the expression of DNA break repair genes was observed. Global microRNA analysis revealed an abnormal expression of mir-27b, mir-106a, mir-199a, and let-7. In ubiquitously distributed adipose tissue (and ASCs), aging brings about important alterations, which might be critical for tissue regeneration and homeostasis. Our findings therefore provide a better understanding of the mechanism(s) involved in stem cell aging and regenerative potential, and this in turn may affect tissue repair that declines with aging.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) can improve the long-term outcome of transplanted individuals and reduce the relapse rate. Valproic acid (VPA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, when combined with different cytokine cocktails, induces the expansion of CD34+ cell populations derived from cord blood (CB) and other sources. We evaluated the effect of VPA, in combination with thrombopoietin (TPO), on the viability and expansion of CB-HSPCs and on short- and long-term engraftability in the NOD/SCID mouse model. In vitro, VPA+TPO inhibited HSPC differentiation and preserved the CD34+ cell fraction; the self-renewal of the CD34+ TPO+VPA-treated cells was suggested by the increased replating efficiency. In vivo, short- and long-term engraftment was determined after 6 and 20weeks. After 6weeks, the median chimerism percentage was 13.0% in mice transplanted with TPO-treated cells and only 1.4% in those transplanted with TPO+VPA-treated cells. By contrast, after 20weeks, the engraftment induced by the TPO+VPA-treated cells was three times more effective than that induced by TPO alone, and over ten times more effective compared to the short-term engraftment induced by the TPO+VPA-treated cells. The in vivo results are consistent with the higher secondary plating efficiency of the TPO+VPA-treated cells in vitro.

Abstract: Pharmacological targeting of inflammation through STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways is, among other inflammatory biomarkers, associated with cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibition and is believed to play a crucial role in prevention and therapy of cancer. Recently, inflammatory factors were found to impact on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) contribution to tumor angiogenesis. Given MSC chemotaxis and cell survival are regulated, in part, by the membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), an MMP also involved in transducing NF-κB intracellular signaling pathways, we tested whether STAT3 regulation by MT1-MMP may also contribute to the expression balance of COX-2 in MSC. We demonstrate that STAT3 phosphorylation was triggered in MSC treated with the MT1-MMP inducer lectin Concanavalin-A (ConA), and that this phosphorylation was abrogated by the JAK2 inhibitor AG490. MT1-MMP gene silencing significantly inhibited ConA-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and this was correlated with reduced proMMP-2 activation and COX-2 expression. On the other hand, STAT3 gene silencing potentiated ConA-induced COX-2 expression, providing evidence for a new MT1-MMP/JAK/STAT3 signaling axis that may, in part, explain how MT1-MMP contributes to proinflammatory intracellular signaling. Given that MSC are avidly recruited within inflammatory microenvironments and within experimental vascularizing tumors, these mechanistic observations support a possible dual control of cell adaptation to inflammation by MT1-MMP and that may enable MSC to be active participants within inflamed tissues.

Abstract: During mitosis, chromatin is highly condensed, and activities such as transcription and semiconservative replication do not occur. Consequently, the condensed condition of mitotic chromatin is assumed to inhibit DNA metabolism by impeding the access of DNA-transacting proteins. However, about 40years ago, several researchers observed unscheduled DNA synthesis in UV-irradiated mitotic chromosomes, suggesting the presence of excision repair. We re-examined this subject by directly measuring the removal of UV-induced DNA lesions by an ELISA and by a Southern-based technique in HeLa cells arrested at mitosis. We observed that the removal of (6-4) photoproducts from the overall genome in mitotic cells was as efficient as in interphase cells. This suggests that global genome repair of (6-4) photoproducts is fully functional during mitosis, and that the DNA in mitotic chromatin is accessible to proteins involved in this mode of DNA repair. Nevertheless, not all modes of DNA repair seem fully functional during mitosis. We also observed that the removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from the dihydrofolate reductase and c-MYC genes in mitotic cells was very slow. This suggests that transcription-coupled repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers is compromised or non-functional during mitosis, which is probably the consequence of mitotic transcriptional repression.

Abstract: Cells of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) play major roles in metabolic functions, maintenance of photoreceptor function, and photoreceptor survival in the retina. They normally form a stable monolayer, but migrate during disease states. Although growth factors produced by the RPE cells primarily control these cellular events, how these factors are regulated in RPE cells remain largely unknown. Here we show that the basic–helix–loop-helix–leucine zipper microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which plays central roles in the development and function of a variety of cell types including RPE cells, upregulates the expression of a multifunctional factor PEDF in RPE cells. Consequently, the upregulation of PEDF impairs microtubule assembly and thus inhibits RPE cell migration. Conversely, specific knockdown of PEDF partially rescues the impairment of microtubule assembly and cell migration proceeds in MITF overexpressing stable cells. We conclude that MITF acts through PEDF to inhibit RPE cell migration and to play a significant role in regulating RPE cellular function. We suggest that MITF has a novel and important role in maintaining RPE cells as a stable monolayer and the down-regulation of PEDF that may contribute to retinal degenerative diseases.

Abstract: Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are bone marrow-derived stromal cells, which play a role in tumor progression. We have shown earlier that breast cancer cells secrete higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) under hypoxia, leading to the recruitment of hMSCs towards hypoxic tumor cells. We found that (i) MDA-MB-231 cells secrete significantly higher levels of lactate (3-fold more) under hypoxia (1% O2) than under 20% O2 and (ii) lactate recruits hMSCs towards tumor cells by activating signaling pathways to enhance migration. The mRNA and protein expression of functional MCT1 in hMSCs is increased in response to lactate exposure. Thus, we hypothesized that hMSCs and stromal carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment have the capacity to take up lactate expelled from tumor cells and use it as a source of energy. Our 13C NMR spectroscopic measurements indicate that 13C-lactate is converted to 13C-alpha ketoglutarate in hMSCs and CAFs supporting this hypothesis. To our knowledge this is the first in vitro model system demonstrating that hMSCs and CAFs can utilize lactate produced by tumor cells.

Abstract: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the strongest regulators of physiological and pathological angiogenesis. VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), the primary receptor for VEGF, is thought to mediate major functional effects of VEGF. Previously, we have localized both VEGF and VEGFR-2 in human hair follicles. In this study, we further defined the expression and roles of VEGFR-2 on human hair follicle dermal papilla (DP) cells. The expression of VEGFR-2 on DP cells was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis separately, and localization of VEGFR-2 was defined by immunofluorescence. The effect of VEGF on DP cells was analyzed by MTT assays and specific inhibitors. Finally, the role of VEGF involved in the signaling pathways was investigated by Western blot. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated the expression of VEGFR-2 on DP cells. Immunostaining for VEGFR-2 showed strong signal on cultured human DP cells in vitro. Exogenous VEGF165 stimulated proliferation of DP cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, this stimulation was blocked by a VEGFR-2 neutralizing antibody (MAB3571) and an ERK inhibitor (PD98059). VEGF165-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was abolished by MAB3571 and PD98059, while the phosphorylation of p38, JNK and AKT were not changed by VEGF165. Taken together, VEGFR-2 is expressed on primary human hair follicle DP cells and VEGF induces proliferation of DP cells through VEGFR-2/ERK pathway, but not p38, JNK or AKT signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a cellular degradation process that can capture and eliminate intracellular microbes by delivering them to lysosomes for destruction. However, pathogens have evolved mechanisms to subvert this process. The intracellular bacterium Brucella abortus ensures its survival by forming the Brucella-containing vacuole (BCV), which traffics from the endocytic compartment to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the bacterium proliferates. We show that Brucella replication in the ER is followed by BCV conversion into a compartment with autophagic features (aBCV). While Brucella trafficking to the ER was unaffected in autophagy-deficient cells, aBCV formation required the autophagy-initiation proteins ULK1, Beclin 1, and ATG14L and PI3-kinase activity. However, aBCV formation was independent of the autophagy-elongation proteins ATG5, ATG16L1, ATG4B, ATG7, and LC3B. Furthermore, aBCVs were required to complete the intracellular Brucella lifecycle and for cell-to-cell spreading, demonstrating that Brucella selectively co-opts autophagy-initiation complexes to subvert host clearance and promote infection.

Abstract: Recent evidence shows that cells exchange collections of signals via microvesicles (MVs) and tunneling nano-tubes (TNTs). In this paper we have investigated whether in cell cultures GPCRs can be transferred by means of MVs and TNTs from a source cell to target cells. Western blot, transmission electron microscopy and gene expression analyses demonstrate that A2A and D2 receptors are present in released MVs. In order to further demonstrate the involvement of MVs in cell-to-cell communication we created two populations of cells (HEK293T and COS-7) transiently transfected with D2R-CFP or A2AR-YFP. These two types of cells were co-cultured, and FRET analysis demonstrated simultaneously positive cells to the D2R-CFP and A2AR-YFP. Fluorescence microscopy analysis also showed that GPCRs can move from one cell to another also by means of TNTs. Finally, recipient cells pre-incubated for 24h with A2AR positive MVs were treated with the adenosine A2A receptor agonist CGS-21680. The significant increase in cAMP accumulation clearly demonstrated that A2ARs were functionally competent in target cells. These findings demonstrate that A2A receptors capable of recognizing and decoding extracellular signals can be safely transferred via MVs from source to target cells.

Abstract: It has been reported that nucleolar fragmentation is a part of the overall apoptotic morphology, however, it is currently obscure whether and how nucleolar fragmentation can be induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) can prevent nucleolar fragmentation. To dissect these two questions, C2C12 myogenic cells and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with heat shock transcriptional factor 1 (HSF1) null mutation were treated with heat shock response (HS) (42.5 ± 0.5°C for 1 h and recovery at 37°C for 24 h) and then were insulted with 0.5 mmol/L H2O2. Morphological changes of nucleoli were observed under contrast microscope or electronic microscope. It was found that (1) stimulation with H2O2-induced nucleolar fragmentation by mediating cleavage and down-regulation of nucleolar protein, nucleolin in C2C12 myocytes and MEFs; (2) HS suppressed nucleolar fragmentation by inducing the expression of Hsp70 in an HSF1-dependent manner as indicated by assays of transfection with Hsp70 antisense oligonucleotides (AS-ONs) or recombinant plasmids of full-length Hsp70 cDNA; (3) protection of Hsp70 against nucleolar fragmentation was related to its accumulation in nucleolus mediated by nuclear localization sequence and its inhibition against cleavage and down-regulation of nucleolin. These results suggested that H2O2-induced nucleolar fragmentation and HS or Hsp70 inhibit H2O2-induced nucleolar fragmentation through the translocation of Hsp70 into nucleolar and its protection against impairment of nucleolin.

Abstract: Chronic high glucose levels lead to the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) as well as AGE precursors, such as methylglyoxal (MG) and glyoxal, via non-enzymatic glycation reactions in patients with diabetic mellitus. Glyoxalase 1 (GLO-1) detoxifies reactive dicarbonyls that form AGEs. To investigate the interaction between AGEs and GLO-1 in mesangial cells (MCs) under diabetic conditions, AGE levels and markers of oxidative stress were measured in GLO-1-overexpressing MCs (GLO-1-MCs) cultured in high glucose. Furthermore, we also examined levels of high glucose-induced apoptosis in GLO-1-MCs. In glomerular MCs, high glucose levels increased the formation of both MG and argpyrimidine (an MG-derived adduct) as well as GLO-1 expression. GLO-1-MCs had lower intracellular levels of MG accumulation, 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (an oxidative DNA damage marker), 4-hydroxyl-2-nonenal (a lipid peroxidation product), and nitrosylated protein (a marker of oxidative-nitrosative stress) compared to control cells. Expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes I, II, and III was also decreased in GLO-1-MCs. Furthermore, fewer GLO-1-MCs showed evidence of apoptosis as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick labeling assay, and activation of both poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 cleavage and caspase-3 was lower in GLO-1-MCs than in control cells cultured in high glucose. These results suggest that GLO-1 plays a role in high glucose-mediated signaling by reducing MG accumulation and oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: Summary
The enteropathogen Shigella flexneri invades epithelial cells, leading to inflammation and tissue destruction. We report that Shigella infection of epithelial cells induces an early genotoxic stress, but the resulting p53 response and cell death are impaired due to the bacterium's ability to promote p53 degradation, mainly through calpain protease activation. Calpain activation is promoted by the Shigella virulence effector VirA and dependent on calcium flux and the depletion of the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin. Further, although VirA-induced calpain activity is critical for regulating cytoskeletal events driving bacterial uptake, calpain activation ultimately leads to necrotic cell death, thereby restricting Shigella intracellular growth. Therefore, calpains work at multiple steps in regulating Shigella pathogenesis by disrupting the p53-dependent DNA repair response early during infection and regulating both formation and ultimate death of the Shigella epithelial replicative niche.

Abstract: Post-heat shock refolding of luciferase requires chaperones. Expression of a dominant negative HSF1 mutant (dnHSF1), which among other effects depletes cells of HSF1-regulated chaperones, blocked post-heat shock refolding of luciferase targeted to the cytoplasm, nucleus, or peroxisomes, while refolding of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted luciferase was inhibited by about 50 %. Luciferase refolding in the cytoplasm could be partially restored by expression of HSPA1A and fully by both HSPA1A and DNAJB1. For full refolding of ER luciferase, HSPA1A expression sufficed. Neither nuclear nor peroxisomal refolding was rescued by HSPA1A. A stimulatory effect of DNAJB1 on post-heat shock peroxisomal luciferase refolding was seen in control cells, while refolding in the cytoplasm or nucleus in control cells was inhibited by DNAJB1 expression in the absence of added HSPA1A. HSPB1 also improved refolding of peroxisomal luciferase in control cells, but not in dnHSF1 expressing cells. HSP90, HSPA5, HSPA6, and phosphomevalonate kinase (of which the synthesis is also downregulated by dnHSF1) had no effect on peroxisomal refolding in either control or chaperone-depleted cells. The chaperone requirement for post-heat shock refolding of peroxisomal luciferase in control cells is thus unusual in that it can be augmented by DNAJB1 or HSPB1 but not by HSPA1A; in dnHSF1 expressing cells, expression of none of the (co)-chaperones tested was effective, and an as yet to be identified, HSF1-regulated function is required.

Abstract: The pioneering discovery of the heat shock response by the Italian scientist Ferruccio Ritossa reached maturity this year, 2012. It was 50 years ago that Professor Ritossa, through an extraordinary combination of serendipity, curiosity, knowledge and inspiration, published the first observation that cells could mount very strong transcriptional activity when exposed to elevated temperatures, which was coined the heat shock response. This discovery led to the identification of heat shock proteins, which impact many areas of current biology and medicine, and has created a new avenue for more exciting discoveries. In recognition of the discovery of the heat shock response, Cell Stress Society International (CSSI) awarded Professor Ritossa with the CSSI medallion in October 2010 in Dozza, Italy. This article is based on a session of the Fifth CSSI Congress held in Québec commemorating Professor Ritossa and his discovery.

Abstract: Osteocalcin (OC) is a major noncollagenous bone matrix protein and an osteoblast marker whose expression is limited to mature osteoblasts during the late differentiation stage. In previous studies we have shown osteosarcomas to lose p53 function with a corresponding loss of osteocalcin gene expression. Introduction of wild type p53 resulted in re expression of the osteocalcin gene. Using gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a putative p53 binding site within the rat OC promoter region and observed an increase in OC promoter activity when p53 accumulates using a CAT assay. The p53 inducible gene Mdm2 is a well-known downstream regulator of p53 levels. Our results showed a synergistic increase in the OC promoter activity when both p53 and MDM2 were transiently overexpressed. We further demonstrate that p53 is not degraded during overexpression of MDM2 protein. Increased OC expression was observed with concomitantly increased p53, VDR, and MDM2 levels in ROS17/2.8 cells during treatment with differentiation promoting (DP) media, but was significantly decreased when co-treated with DP media and the small molecule inhibitor of MDM2–p53 interaction, Nutlin-3. We have also observed a dramatic increase of the OC promoter activity in the presence of p53 and Mdm2 with inclusion of Cbfa-1 and p300 factors. Our results suggest that under some physiological conditions the oncoprotein MDM2 may cooperate with p53 to regulate the osteocalcin gene during osteoblastic differentiation.

Abstract: After more than a decade of extensive experimentation, the promise of stem cells to revolutionize the field of medicine has negotiated their entry into clinical trial. Adipose tissue specifically holds potential as an attainable and abundant source of stem cells. Currently undergoing investigation are adipose stem cell (ASC) therapies for diabetes and critical limb ischemia, among others. In the enthusiastic pursuit of regenerative therapies, however, questions remain regarding ASC persistence and migration, and, importantly, their safety and potential for neoplasia. To date, assays of in vivo ASC activity have been limited by early end points. We hypothesized that with time, ASCs injected subcutaneously undergo removal by normal tissue turnover and homeostasis, and by the host's immune system. In this study, a high dose of culture expanded ASCs was formulated and implanted as multicellular aggregates into immunocompromised mice, which were maintained for over one year. Animals were monitored for toxicity, and surviving cells quantified at study endpoint. No difference in growth/weight or lifespan was found between cell-treated and vehicle treated animals, and no malignancies were detected in treated animals. Moreover, real-time PCR for a human specific sequence, ERV-3, detected no persistent ASCs. With the advent of clinical application, clarification of currently enigmatic stem cell properties has become imperative. Our study represents the longest duration determination of stem cell activity in vivo, and contributes strong evidence in support of the safety of adipose derived stem cell applications.

Abstract: Sox9 is a high-mobility group box-containing transcription factor that functions as a key regulator of chondrogenesis. We here report that Sox9 mediates the direct conversion of tenocytes to chondrocytes through an intermediate state in which both differentiation programs are active. Sox9 is abundantly expressed in cartilage but is undetectable in limb tendons that express Scleraxis (Scx) and Tenomodulin (Tnmd), tendon-specific early and late molecular markers, respectively. Upon forced expression of Sox9 in the chick forelimb, ectopic cartilage formation is preferentially observed in fibrous tissues including the tendons, ligaments, perichondrium/periosteum, dermis, and muscle connective tissues. Tnmd expression in tenocytes isolated from leg tendons was markedly upregulated by forced expression of basic helix–loop–helix (b-HLH) activators including Scx, Paraxis, Twist1 and Twist2. In contrast, the overexpression of Sox9 in monolayer tenocytes resulted in the downregulation of Tnmd and Scx expressions during passaging in culture, and the induction of cartilage molecular markers such as type II collagen (Col2a1) and Chondromodulin-I (ChM-I). This Sox9-driven switching from a tenocytic to a chondrocytic gene expression profile was associated with a dramatic change from a spindle to a polygonal cellular morphology. The extracellular accumulation of cartilage-characteristic proteoglycans was also observed. These data suggest that tenocytes have a strong potential for conversion into chondrocytes through the activities of Sox9 both in vitro and in vivo.

Carbonic anhydrase III regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2,

Abstract: Carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) is an isoenzyme of the CA family. Because of its low specific anhydrase activity, physiological functions in addition to hydrating CO2 have been proposed. CAIII expression is highly induced in adipogenesis and CAIII is the most abundant protein in adipose tissues. The function of CAIII in both preadipocytes and adipocytes is however unknown. In the present study we demonstrate that adipogenesis is greatly increased in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from CAIII knockout (KO) mice, as demonstrated by a greater than 10-fold increase in the induction of fatty acid-binding protein-4 (FABP4) and increased triglyceride formation in CAIII−/− MEFs compared with CAIII+/+ cells. To address the underlying mechanism, we investigated the expression of the two adipogenic key regulators, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2 (PPARγ2) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α. We found a considerable (approximately 1000-fold) increase in the PPARγ2 expression in the CAIII−/− MEFs. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous CAIII in NIH 3T3-L1 preadipocytes resulted in a significant increase in the induction of PPARγ2 and FABP4. When both CAIII and PPARγ2 were knocked down, FABP4 was not induced. We conclude that down-regulation of CAIII in preadipocytes enhances adipogenesis and that CAIII is a regulator of adipogenic differentiation which acts at the level of PPARγ2 gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
A major virulence factor of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a variant protein expressed on the infected erythrocyte surface. PfEMP1 is responsible for adherence of infected erythrocytes to the endothelium and plays an important role in pathogenesis. Mutually exclusive transcription and switched expression of one of 60 var genes encoding PfEMP1 in each parasite genome provides a mechanism for antigenic variation. We report the identification of a parasite protein, designated PfSET10, which localizes exclusively to the perinuclear active var gene expression site. PfSET10 is a histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferase required to maintain the active var gene in a poised state during division for reactivation in daughter parasites, and as such is required for P. falciparum antigenic variation. PfSET10 likely maintains the transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment of the active var promoter and thus retains memory for heritable transmission of epigenetic information during parasite division.

Protein kinase D1 stimulates proliferation and enhances tumorigenesis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells through a MEK/ERK-dependent signaling pathway,

Abstract: Protein kinase D1, PKD1, is a novel serine/threonine kinase whose altered expression and dysregulation in many tumors as well as its activation by several mitogens suggest that this protein could regulate proliferation and tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the precise signaling pathways used are still unclear and the potential direct role of PKD1 in tumor development and progression has not been yet investigated. In order to clarify the role of PKD1 in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, we studied the effects of PKD1 overexpression in a human adenocarcinoma breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 cells. We demonstrated that overexpression of PKD1 specifically promotes MCF-7 cell proliferation through accelerating G0/G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle. Moreover, inhibition of endogenous PKD1 significantly reduced cell proliferation. Taken together, these results clearly strengthen the regulatory role of PKD1 in cell growth. We also demonstrated that overexpression of PKD1 specifically diminished serum- and anchorage-dependence for proliferation and survival in vitro and allowed MCF-7 cells to form tumors in vivo. Thus, all these data highlight the central role of PKD1 in biological processes which are hallmarks of malignant transformation. Analysis of two major signaling pathways implicated in MCF-7 cell proliferation showed that PKD1 overexpression significantly increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation state without affecting Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, PKD1 overexpression-stimulated cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth were totally impaired by inhibition of the MEK/ERK kinase cascade. However, neither of these effects was affected by blocking the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Thus, the MEK/ERK signaling appears to be a determining pathway mediating the biological effects of PKD1 in MCF-7 cells. Taken together, all these data demonstrate that PKD1 overexpression increases the aggressiveness of MCF-7 breast cancer cells through enhancing their oncogenic properties and would, therefore, define PKD1 as a potentially new promising anti-tumor therapeutic target.

Abstract: Three clonal subpopulations of DLKP, a poorly differentiated squamous lung carcinoma cell line, display striking differences in ability to survive in suspension (anoikis resistance). DLKP-SQ is anoikis resistant (7.5% anoikis at 24h). In contrast, DLKP-M and DLKP-I are sensitive to anoikis (49.2% and 42.6% respectively). DLKP-I shows increased apoptosis consistently over all time points tested while DLKP-M appear to slow down metabolically and perhaps delays onset of anoikis by undergoing autophagy. Expression microarray analysis identified pronounced differential expression of Olfactomedin 3 (OLFM3) between the clones. High expression of OLFM3 was confirmed at the RNA level by qRT-PCR in DLKP-SQ and at the protein level by Western blotting (within the cell and secreted). Little or no OLFM3 was detected in the other two clones (DLKP-M and DLKP-I). Following siRNA knockdown of OLFM3 in DLKP-SQ, anoikis was increased 2.8-fold to 21% which was intermediate between the anoikis levels in DLKP-SQ and DLKP-M or DLKP-I. This knockdown correlated with increased apoptosis in suspension but not in attached culture conditions. Addition of recombinant OLFM3 reduced anoikis in DLKP-I. This is the first instance of OLFM3 being linked with anoikis resistance in a human cancer cell line.

Abstract: Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy involves the inhalation of 100% oxygen, whilst inside a chamber at greater than atmospheric pressure. It is an effective treatment for chronic diabetic wounds, although the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. We hypothesised that HBO could alter inflammatory gene expression in human endothelial cells via a reactive oxygen/nitrogen species-mediated pathway. Endothelial cells were exposed to a chronic wound model comprising hypoxia (2% O2 at 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA); PO2 ~2kPa) in the presence of lipopolysaccharide and TNF-α for 24h, then treated with HBO for 90min (97.5% O2 at 2.4 ATA; PO2 ~237kPa). 5h post-HBO, 19 genes involved in adhesion, angiogenesis, inflammation and oxidative stress were downregulated. Notably, only angiogenin gene expression, which promotes both angiogenesis and nitric oxide production (reflected by increased eNOS protein expression in this study), was upregulated. This led to a decrease in endothelial IL-8 mRNA and protein, which could help alleviate inflammatory processes during chronic wound healing. This was no longer evident 22.5h post-HBO, demonstrating the importance of daily exposures in HBO treatment protocols. These studies indicate that elevated oxygen transiently regulates inflammatory gene expression in endothelial cells, which may enhance chronic wound healing.

Abstract: Mucus hypersecretion is an important manifestation in patients with chronic inflammatory airway diseases. Excessive production of mucin leads to airway mucus obstruction and contributes to morbidity and mortality in these diseases. The molecular mechanisms underlying mucin overproduction, however, still remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), an important human respiratory pathogen, induced MUC5AC mucin expression via an epithelial cell signaling cascade in human airway epithelial cells. The flagellin purified from P. aeruginosa up-regulated MUC5AC expression by activating its receptor Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) in 16HBE cells. This effect was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitor (DPI), small interfering RNA of dual oxidase 2 (Duox2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers (nPG and DMSO). Flagellin induced TGF-α release, and stimulated phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MUC5AC overproduction. These effects were prevented by EGFR and TGF-α neutralizing antibodies, metalloprotease inhibitors (GM6001 and TNF-α protease inhibitor-1) and specific knockdown of TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) with TACE siRNA. These findings may bring new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections and lead to novel therapeutic intervention for mucin overproduction in patients with P. aeruginosa infections.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant human primary brain tumor, and its infiltrative nature represents the leading cause for the failure of therapies and tumor recurrences. It is therefore crucial the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying GBM invasion to identify novel therapeutic targets to limit motility. In this study, we evaluated the role of Epidermal growth factor receptor Pathway Substrate 8 (Eps8), a crucial regulator of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics accompanying cell motility and invasion, in GBM migration and invasiveness. We found that silencing of the protein by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) abrogated the migratory and invasive capacity of three different human GBM cell lines both in 2-dimensional (2-D) and 3-dimensional (3-D) in vitro assays. The inhibitory effect on invasion was maintained independently by the migration mode utilized by the cells in our 3-D model, and was accompanied by an impaired formation of actin-based cytoskeletal protrusive structures. Our data propose Eps8 as a key molecule involved in the control of the intrinsic invasive behavior of GBM cells, and suggest that this protein might represent a useful target for the design of new drugs for the treatment of these tumors.

Abstract: There is a growing evidence that the human homologue of the Drosophila headcase (HECA) plays an important role in human carcinogenesis. So far specific protein interaction partners and affected signaling pathways of HECA are still elusive. In a recent study we showed that HECA overexpression in oral squamous-cell carcinoma (OSCC) keratinocytes has tumor suppressive effects resulting in a recuperation of cell cycle control concerning the entry and progression of S-phase, G2- and M-phase. Currently, quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis of primary tumor tissue from OSCC patients demonstrate that HECA expression is markedly decreased compared to normal control patients with abundant HECA expression. Additionally, there is nearly no HECA expression in OSCC metastases. Here, we show that HECA expression is negatively controlled by the Wnt-pathway and TCF4, a Wnt related transcription factor, binds to the HECA promoter. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry reveals colocalization of HECA with the cyclin dependent kinase CDK9. Immunoprecipitation experiments and proximity ligation assays further reveal an interaction of HECA with CDK2, CDK9, Cyclin A and Cyclin K, a direct transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor. Silencing HECA in OSCC cell lines leads to a significant increase of cell division and a markedly increased resistance against the chemotherapeutic cisplatin. On the contrary, HECA overexpressing OSCC cell lines show decreased resistance of OSCC cells against cisplatin. Therefore, HECA could be considered as future therapeutic agent against Wnt-dependent tumor progression.

Abstract: Rapid transcription of the survival transcript, inducible heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), is critical for mounting cytoprotection against severe cellular stress, like elevated temperature. Previous investigations have demonstrated that exercise-induced expression of Hsp70 protein occurs in a fiber-specific pattern; however, the activation pattern of hsp70 mRNA expression remains unclear in skeletal muscle. Consequentially, the temporal localization of hsp70 mRNA was characterized via in situ hybridization (ISH) experiments examining fast-muscle, white vastus: 1, 3, 10, and 24 h after a single bout of intense treadmill running (1 h, 30 m/min, 6% grade) in rats. The role that the physiologic temperature stress associated with exercise (raising core body temperature to 40.0°C for 15 min (HS-40.0°C)) might play in inducing hsp70 mRNA expression was also explored. In skeletal muscle myofibers (SkM), hsp70 mRNA ISH signal was observed to be concentrated in a punctate manner that was associated with nuclei post-exercise. HS-40°C treatment produced minimal detectable hsp70 mRNA ISH signal in SkM. In large intermyofibrillar blood vessels (BV), peak hsp70 mRNA signal, distributed throughout the vessel wall, was observed 1 h post-exercise. In BV, no differences in hsp70 mRNA signal were observed between HS-40°C and EX-1 h. Results indicate that the majority of hsp70 mRNA is retained in a perinuclear localization in SkM post-exercise. They further suggest a muscle-type specific time course for peak hsp70 mRNA expression. This investigation suggests that the physiologic rise in core temperature associated with exercise per se is not the key stimulus responsible for inducing hsp70 mRNA transcription in SkM.

Abstract: Summary
Phagocytosis and autophagy are two important and related arms of the host's first-line defense against microbial invasion. Rubicon is a RUN domain containing cysteine-rich protein that functions as part of a Beclin-1-Vps34-containing autophagy complex. We report that Rubicon is also an essential, positive regulator of the NADPH oxidase complex. Upon microbial infection or Toll-like-receptor 2 (TLR2) activation, Rubicon interacts with the p22phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex, facilitating its phagosomal trafficking to induce a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines. Consequently, ectopic expression or depletion of Rubicon profoundly affected ROS, inflammatory cytokine production, and subsequent antimicrobial activity. Rubicon's actions in autophagy and in the NADPH oxidase complex are functionally and genetically separable, indicating that Rubicon functions in two ancient innate immune machineries, autophagy and phagocytosis, depending on the environmental stimulus. Rubicon may thus be pivotal to generating an optimal intracellular immune response against microbial infection.

Abstract: The molecular chaperone DnaK binds to exposed hydrophobic segments in proteins, protecting them from aggregation. DnaK interacts with protein substrates via its substrate-binding domain, and the affinity of this interaction is allosterically regulated by its nucleotide-binding domain. In addition to regulating interdomain allostery, the nucleotide state has been found to influence homo-oligomerization of DnaK. However, the architecture of oligomeric DnaK and its potential functional relevance in the chaperone cycle remain undefined. Towards that goal, we examined the structures of DnaK by negative stain electron microscopy. We found that DnaK samples contain an ensemble of monomers, dimers, and other small, defined multimers. To better understand the function of these oligomers, we stabilized them by cross-linking and found that they retained ATPase activity and protected a model substrate from denaturation. However, these oligomers had a greatly reduced ability to refold substrate and did not respond to stimulation by DnaJ. Finally, we observed oligomeric DnaK in Escherichia coli cellular lysates by native gel electrophoresis and found that these structures became noticeably more prevalent in cells exposed to heat shock. Together, these studies suggest that DnaK oligomers are composed of ordered multimers that are functionally distinct from monomeric DnaK. Thus, oligomerization of DnaK might be an important step in chaperone cycling.

Abstract: Induction of heat shock proteins (Hsp) 72 and 27 can improve insulin signalling in obesity and type 2 diabetes via inhibition of key stress kinases. In metabolic disease, altered insulin signalling, as illustrated by increased serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 (Ser312), is not confined to muscle or liver and can also affect other tissues and cell types, potentially impairing their primary biological function. This study specifically investigated insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in monocytes and examined the impact of HSP induction on insulin signalling. Control (CG, BMI < 25 kg/m2) or obese (OG, BMI > 30 kg/m2) participants were included in the study. Glucose transporter (GLUT)4 expression on monocytes, phosphorylated JNK, IKK-β and IRS-1, as well as Hsp27 and Hsp72, were measured in monocytes under fasting conditions. GLUT4 expression was also measured during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). HSP induction as well as JNK, IKK-β activation and IRS-1 serine phosphorylation was investigated following heat stress. Obese patients showed lower GLUT4 levels on monocytes during the OGTT. pJNK, pIKK-β and pIRS-1 levels were increased in OG with pJNK and pIKK-β levels positively correlated with serine pIRS-1 and negatively with GLUT4 supporting their role in insulin resistance. Heat exposure induced Hsp72 and Hps27, but only in CG for the latter, and decreased pJNK, pIKK-β and pIRS-1. Our results show that induction of Hsp72 and 27 via heat stress is associated with inactivation of stress kinases and reduced serine pIRS-1 in monocytes from obese participants. This indicates that metabolic diseases can also affect monocyte metabolism via cellular stress that can be modulated via HSP induction.

Abstract: The 4.1 proteins are cytoskeletal adaptor proteins that are linked to the control of mechanical stability of certain membranes and to the cellular accumulation and cell surface display of diverse transmembrane proteins. One of the four mammalian 4.1 proteins, 4.1R (80kDa/120kDa isoforms), has recently been shown to be required for the normal operation of several ion transporters in the heart (Stagg MA et al. Circ Res, 2008; 103: 855–863). The other three (4.1G, 4.1N and 4.1B) are largely uncharacterised in the heart. Here, we use specific antibodies to characterise their expression, distribution and novel activities in the left ventricle. We detected 4.1R, 4.1G and 4.1N by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting, but not 4.1B. Only one splice variant of 4.1N and 4.1G was seen whereas there are several forms of 4.1R. 4.1N, like 4.1R, was present in intercalated discs, but unlike 4.1R, it was not localised at the lateral plasma membrane. Both 4.1R and 4.1N were in internal structures that, at the level of resolution of the light microscope, were close to the Z-disc (possibly T-tubules). 4.1G was also in intracellular structures, some of which were coincident with sarcoplasmic reticulum. 4.1G existed in an immunoprecipitable complex with spectrin and SERCA2. 80kDa 4.1R was present in subcellular fractions enriched in intercalated discs, in a complex resistant to solubilization under non-denaturing conditions. At the intercalated disc 4.1R does not colocalise with the adherens junction protein, β-catenin, but does overlap with the other plasma membrane signalling proteins, the Na/K-ATPase and the Na/Ca exchanger NCX1. We conclude that isoforms of 4.1 proteins are differentially compartmentalised in the heart, and that they form specific complexes with proteins central to cardiomyocyte Ca2+ metabolism.

Abstract: Accumulation of mis- and unfolded proteins during viral replication can cause stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR). If unchecked, this process may induce cellular changes detrimental to viral replication. In the report, we investigated the impact of HSV-1 on the UPR during lytic replication. We found that HSV-1 effectively disarms the UPR in early stages of viral infection. Only ATF6 activation was detected during early infection, but with no upregulation of target chaperone proteins. Activity of the eIF2α/ATF4 signaling arm increased at the final stage of HSV-1 replication, which may indicate completion of virion assembly and egress, thus releasing suppression of the UPR. We also found that the promoter of viral ICP0 was responsive to ER stress, an apparent mimicry of cellular UPR genes. These results suggest that HSV-1 may use ICP0 as a sensor to modulate the cellular stress response.

Abstract: Summary
SAMHD1 has recently been identified as an HIV-1 restriction factor operating in myeloid cells. As a countermeasure, the Vpx accessory protein from HIV-2 and certain lineages of SIV have evolved to antagonize SAMHD1 by inducing its ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation. Here, we show that SAMHD1 experienced strong positive selection episodes during primate evolution that occurred in the Catarrhini ancestral branch prior to the separation between hominoids (gibbons and great apes) and Old World monkeys. The identification of SAMHD1 residues under positive selection led to mapping the Vpx-interaction domain of SAMHD1 to its C-terminal region. Importantly, we found that while SAMHD1 restriction activity toward HIV-1 is evolutionarily maintained, antagonism of SAMHD1 by Vpx is species-specific. The distinct evolutionary signature of SAMHD1 sheds light on the development of its antiviral specificity.

Abstract: Summary
The human SAMHD1 protein potently restricts lentiviral infection in dendritic cells and monocyte/macrophages but is antagonized by the primate lentiviral protein Vpx, which targets SAMHD1 for degradation. However, only two of eight primate lentivirus lineages encode Vpx, whereas its paralog, Vpr, is conserved across all extant primate lentiviruses. We find that not only multiple Vpx but also some Vpr proteins are able to degrade SAMHD1, and such antagonism led to dramatic positive selection of SAMHD1 in the primate subfamily Cercopithecinae. Residues that have evolved under positive selection precisely determine sensitivity to Vpx/Vpr degradation and alter binding specificity. By overlaying these functional analyses on a phylogenetic framework of Vpr and Vpx evolution, we can decipher the chronology of acquisition of SAMHD1-degrading abilities in lentiviruses. We conclude that vpr neofunctionalized to degrade SAMHD1 even prior to the birth of a separate vpx gene, thereby initiating an evolutionary arms race with SAMHD1.

Abstract: The heat shock protein, HSP70, is over-expressed in many tumours and acts at the crossroads of key intracellular processes in its role as a molecular chaperone. HSP70 associates with a vast array of peptides, some of which are antigenic and can mount adaptive immune responses against the tumour from which they are derived. The pool of peptides associated with HSP70 represents a unique barcode of protein metabolism in tumour cells. With a view to identifying unique protein targets that may be developed as tumour biomarkers, we used purified HSP70 and its associated peptide pool (HSP70–peptide complexes, HSP70-PCs) from different human breast tumour cell lines as targets for phage display biopanning. Our results show that HSP70-PCs from each cell line interact with unique sets of peptides within the phage display library. One of the peptides, termed IST, enriched in the biopanning process, was used in a ‘pull-down’ assay to identify the original protein from which the HSP70-associated peptides may have been derived. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3), a member of the elongation factor EF1α family, and the HSP GRP78, were pulled down by the IST peptide. All of these proteins are known to be up-regulated in cancer cells. Immunohistochemical staining of tumour tissue microarrays showed that the peptide co-localised with HSP70 in breast tumour tissue. The data indicate that the reservoir of peptides associated with HSP70 can act as a unique indicator of cellular protein activity and a novel source of potential tumour biomarkers.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that Ca2+ overload is one of the major contributors of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury. Since Frizzled-2 receptor, a seven transmembrane protein, transduces downstream signaling by specialized binding of Wnt5a to increase intracellular Ca2+ release, this work aimed to investigate the effect of Frizzled-2 on Ca2+ accumulation in H9c2 cells, which were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation to mimic myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. After exposing H9c2 cells to hypoxia/reoxygenation, we observed higher expression of Frizzled-2 and Wnt5a as compared to control group cells. Hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced intracellular Ca2+ accumulation approached that of cells transfected with frizzled-2 plasmid. In cells treated with RNAi specifically designed against frizzled-2, intracellular Ca2+ in both hypoxia/reoxygenation-treated cells and plasmid-treated cells were decreased. Rats that underwent ischemia/reperfusion injury exhibited increased intracellular Ca2+ with high expression levels of Frizzled-2 and Wnt5a as compared to the sham group. Our data indicates that upon binding to Wnt5a, increased Frizzled-2 expression after hypoxia/reoxygenation treatment activated intracellular calcium release in H9c2 cells. Our findings provide a new perspective in understanding calcium overload in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion.

Abstract: Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors and an important contributor to tumor radioresistance. miR-210 is the most consistently and robustly induced microRNA under hypoxia in different types of tumor cells and normal cells. In the present study, to explore the feasibility of miR-210 as an effective therapeutic target, lentiviral-mediated anti-sense miR-210 gene transfer technique was employed to downregulate miR-210 expression in hypoxic human hepatoma SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HuH7 cells, and phenotypic changes of which were analyzed. Hypoxia led to an increased hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and miR-210 expression and cell arrest in the G0/G1 phase in all cell lines. miR-210 downregulation significantly suppressed cell viability, induced cell arrest in the G0/G1 phase, increased apoptotic rate and enhanced radiosensitivity in hypoxic human hepatoma cells. Moreover, apoptosis-inducing factor, mitochondrion-associated, 3 (AIFM3) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-210. AIFM3 downregulation by siRNA attenuated radiation induced apoptosis in miR-210 downregulated hypoxic human hepatoma cells. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-210 might be a potential therapeutic target and specific inhibition of miR-210 expression in combination with radiotherapy might be expected to exert strong anti-tumor effect on hypoxic human hepatoma cells.

Abstract: cAMP pathway activation by thyrotropin (TSH) induces differentiation and gene expression in thyrocytes. We investigated which partners of the cAMP cascade regulate gene expression modulations: protein kinase A and/or the exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac). Human primary cultured thyrocytes were analysed by microarrays after treatment with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, the protein kinase A (PKA) activator 6-MB-cAMP and the Epac-selective cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (007) alone or combined with 6-MB-cAMP. Profiles were compared to those of TSH. Cultures treated with the adenylate cyclase- or the PKA activator alone or the latter combined with 007 had profiles similar to those induced by TSH. mRNA profiles of 007-treated cultures were highly distinct from TSH-treated cells, suggesting that TSH-modulated gene expressions are mainly modulated by cAMP and PKA and not through Epac in cultured human thyroid cells. To investigate whether the Epac-Rap-RapGAP pathway could play a potential role in thyroid tumorigenesis, the mRNA expressions of its constituent proteins were investigated in two malignant thyroid tumor types. Modulations of this pathway suggest an increased Rap pathway activity in these cancers independent from cAMP activation.

Abstract: Studies on lymph node metastasis of soft tissue sarcomas are insufficient because of its rarity. In this study, we examined the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C and VEGF-D in soft tissue sarcomas metastasized to lymph nodes. In addition, the effects of the two molecules on the barrier function of a lymphatic endothelial cell monolayer against sarcoma cells were analyzed. We examined 7 patients who had soft tissue sarcomas with lymph node metastases and who had undergone neither chemotherapy nor radiotherapy before lymphadenectomy. Immunohistochemistry revealed that 2 of 7 sarcomas that metastasized to lymph nodes expressed VEGF-C both in primary and metastatic lesions. On the other hand, VEGF-D expression was detected in 4 of 7 primary and 7 of 7 metastatic lesions, respectively. Interestingly, 3 cases that showed no VEGF-D expression at primary sites expressed VEGF-D in metastatic lesions. Recombinant VEGF-C at 10−8 and VEGF-D at 10−7and 10−8g/ml significantly increased the random motility of lymphatic endothelial cells compared with controls. VEGF-D significantly increased the migration of sarcoma cells through lymphatic endothelial monolayers. The fact that VEGF-D induced the migration of fibrosarcomas through the lymphatic endothelial monolayer is the probable reason for the strong relationship between VEGF-D expression and lymph node metastasis in soft tissue sarcomas. The important propensities of this molecule for the increase of lymph node metastases are not only lymphangiogenesis but also down-regulation of the barrier function of lymphatic endothelial monolayers, which facilitates sarcoma cells entering the lymphatic circulation.

Abstract: Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cad) tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation has been implicated in the disruption of adherens junctions (AJs) induced by inflammatory reactions. The impacts of statins on integrity of AJs and VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation have not been explored. The effects of atorvastatin on IL-1β and monocyte-induced VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) were studied. In ECs treated with interleukin (IL)-1β for 30min, VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation, dissociation of the VE-cad/β-catenin complex and transendothelial migration (TEM) of monocytes were increased. These processes were mediated by activation of HRas and RhoA that leads to phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC). Atorvastatin inhibited IL-1β-induced Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad by inhibiting RhoA and by dephosphorylating MLC. The attenuating effect of atorvastatin on VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation was reversed when RhoA was activated or MLC phosphatase was inhibited. Furthermore, inhibiting farnesyl transferase or geranylgeranyl transferase reproduced the inhibitory effects of atorvastatin on VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation. In addition, atorvastatin inhibited monocyte-induced VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation in ECs and attenuated IL-1β-induced TEM of monocytes. Our study introduces a novel pleiotropic effect of atorvastatin and suggests that statins protect the integrity of AJs in ECs by inhibiting RhoA-mediated Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad.

Abstract: The fundamental question of how and which neuronal specific transcription factors tailor mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics to the need of developing neuronal cells has remained largely unexplored. In this study, we report that the neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NeuroD6 possesses mitochondrial biogenic properties by amplifying the mitochondrial DNA content and TFAM expression levels, a key regulator for mitochondrial biogenesis. NeuroD6-mediated increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in the neuronal progenitor-like PC12-NEUROD6 cells is concomitant with enhanced mitochondrial bioenergetic functions, including increased expression levels of specific subunits of respiratory complexes of the electron transport chain, elevated mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels produced by oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, NeuroD6 augments the bioenergetic capacity of PC12-NEUROD6 cells to generate an energetic reserve, which confers tolerance to the mitochondrial stressor, rotenone. We found that NeuroD6 induces an adaptive bioenergetic response throughout rotenone treatment involving maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels in conjunction with preservation of the actin network. In conclusion, our results support the concept that NeuroD6 plays an integrative role in regulating and coordinating the onset of neuronal differentiation with acquisition of adequate mitochondrial mass and energetic capacity to ensure energy demanding events, such as cytoskeletal remodeling, plasmalemmal expansion, and growth cone formation.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells have the potential to differentiate into all human cell types and therefore hold a great therapeutic promise. Differentiation into the embryonic endoderm and its derivatives is of special interest since it can provide a cure for severe widespread clinical conditions such as diabetes and hepatic failure. In this work we established a unique experimental outline that enables the study of early human endoderm development and can help improve and create new differentiation protocols. To this end we started with mesendoderm cells and separated them into early endoderm and mesoderm progenitor cells using CXCR4 and PDGFRA cell surface markers. We molecularly characterized the different lineages, and demonstrated the importance of the TGFβ pathway in definitive endoderm initiation. The endoderm progenitor cells were then purified creating an endodermal differentiation niche that is not affected by other cell populations. We followed the differentiation of these cells at different time points, and demonstrated an up regulation of genes indicative to differentiation into both foregut and hindgut. Surprisingly, upon continued culture, there was significant down regulation of the hepatic gene signature. This down regulation could be rescued with FGF2 treatment demonstrating its importance in hepatic cell maintenance. In conclusion, we suggest that isolating endoderm progenitor cells is crucial for the analysis of their fate, and enables the identification of factors involved in their differentiation and maintenance.

Abstract: Increased protein aggregation and altered cell signaling accompany many neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's disease (HD). Cell stress is counterbalanced by signals mediating cell repair but the identity of these are not fully understood. We show here that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is inhibited and cytoprotective autophagy is activated in neuronal PC6.3 cells at 24h after expression of mutant huntingtin proteins. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1/2 interacted with growth arrest and DNA damage protein 34 (GADD34), which caused TSC2 dephosphorylation and induction of autophagy in mutant huntingtin expressing cells. However, GADD34 and autophagy decreased at later time points, after 48h of transfection with the concomitant increase in mTOR activity. Overexpression of GADD34 counteracted these effects and increased cytoprotective autophagy and cell survival. These results show that GADD34 plays an important role in cell protection in mutant huntingtin expressing cells. Modulation of GADD34 and the TSC pathway may prove useful in counteracting cell degeneration accompanying HD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Previously, we reported on the presence of antibodies to linear epitopes of human and mycobacterial 60 kD heat shock proteins (HSP) in the sera of healthy blood donors. Since many recent findings indicate that the levels of these antibodies may be altered in coronary heart disease (CHD) and also inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), it seemed worthwhile to compare the epitope specificity of the anti-HSP60 and anti-HSP65 antibodies in the sera of patients with these diseases to those in healthy subjects. The multipin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method was applied with a large overlapping set of synthetic 10-mer peptides covering selected regions of human HSP60 and Mycobacterium bovis HSP65. Sera of 12 healthy persons (HP), 14 CHD, and 14 IBD patients with the same concentration of total anti-HSP60 and HSP65 IgG antibodies were tested. We have identified CHD-specific epitopes in the equatorial domain of the HSP60 protein but in neither region of the HSP65 molecule, indicating that the formation of anti-HSP60 antibodies is not or only partially due to the cross-reaction between human HSP60 and bacterial HSP65. IBD-specific epitopes were found in many regions of the HSP60 and in even more regions of the HSP65 molecule including an IBD-specific T cell epitope in region X as well. These findings indicate that the epitope specificity of the anti-human and anti-mycobacterial HSP60 antibodies associated with various diseases is different.

Abstract: Developing targeted therapies for high grade gliomas (HGG), the most common primary brain tumor in adults, relies largely on glioma cultures. However, it is unclear if HGG tumorigenic signaling pathways are retained under in-vitro conditions. Using array comparative genomic hybridization and immunohistochemical profiling, we contrasted the epidermal and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (EGFR/PDGFR) in-vitro pathway status of twenty-six primary HGG cultures with the pathway status of their original HGG biopsies. Genomic gains or amplifications were lost during culturing while genomic losses were more likely to be retained. Loss of EGFR amplification was further verified immunohistochemically when EGFR over expression was decreased in the majority of cultures. Conversely, PDGFRα and PDGFRβ were more abundantly expressed in primary cultures than in the original tumor (p<0.05). Despite these genomic and proteomic differences, primary HGG cultures retained key aspects of dysregulated tumorigenic signaling. Both in-vivo and in-vitro the presence of EGFR resulted in downstream activation of P70s6K while reduced downstream activation was associated with the presence of PDGFR and the tumor suppressor, PTEN. The preserved pathway dysregulation make this glioma model suitable for further studies of glioma tumorigenesis, however individual culture related differences must be taken into consideration when testing responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents.

Abstract: High-grade gliomas (HGG), are the most common aggressive brain tumours in adults. Inhibitors targeting growth factor signalling pathways in glioma have shown a low clinical response rate. To accurately evaluate response to targeted therapies further in vitro studies are necessary. Growth factor pathway expression using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mutant EGFR (EGFRvIII), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), C-Kit and C-Abl together with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression and downstream activation of AKT and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (P70S6K) was analysed in 26 primary glioma cultures treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib, gefitinib and imatinib. Response to TKIs was assessed using 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50). Response for each culture was compared with the EGFR/PDGFR immunocytochemical pathway profile using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Erlotinib response was not strongly associated with high expression of the growth factor pathway components. PTEN expression did not correlate with response to any of the three TKIs. Increased EGFR expression was associated with gefitinib response; increased PDGFR-α expression was associated with imatinib response. The results of this in vitro study suggest gefitinib and imatinib may have therapeutic potential in HGG tumours with a corresponding growth factor receptor expression profile.

Abstract: Cell migration is a multistep process initiated by extracellular matrix components that leads to cytoskeletal changes and formation of different protrusive structures at the cell periphery. Lumican, a small extracellular matrix leucine-rich proteoglycan, has been shown to inhibit human melanoma cell migration by binding to α2β1 integrin and affecting actin cytoskeleton organization. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of lumican overexpression on the migration ability of human colon adenocarcinoma LS180 cells. The cells stably transfected with plasmid containing lumican cDNA were characterized by the increased chemotactic migration measured on Transwell filters. Lumican-overexpressing cells presented the elevated filamentous to monomeric actin ratio and gelsolin up-regulation. This was accompanied by a distinct cytoskeletal actin rearrangement and gelsolin subcellular relocation, as observed under laser scaning confocal microscope. Moreover, LS180 cells overexpressing lumican tend to form podosome-like structures as indicated by vinculin redistribution and its colocalization with gelsolin and actin at the submembrane region of the cells. In conclusion, the elevated level of lumican secretion to extracellular space leads to actin cytoskeletal remodeling followed by an increase in migration capacity of human colon LS180 cells. These data suggest that lumican expression and its presence in ECM has an impact on colon cancer cells motility and may modulate invasiveness of colon cancer.

Abstract: Adipose tissue is expected to provide a source of cells for protein replacement therapies via auto-transplantation. However, the conditioning of the environment surrounding the transplanted adipocytes for their long-term survival and protein secretion properties has not been established. We have recently developed a preparation procedure for preadipocytes, ceiling culture-derived proliferative adipocytes (ccdPAs), as a therapeutic gene vehicle suitable for stable gene product secretion. We herein report the results of our evaluation of using fibrin glue as a scaffold for the transplanted ccdPAs for the expression of a transduced gene in a three-dimensional culture system. The ccdPAs secreted the functional protein translated from an exogenously transduced gene, as well as physiological adipocyte proteins, and the long viability of ccdPAs (up to 84days) was dependent on the fibrinogen concentrations. The ccdPAs spontaneously accumulated lipid droplets, and their expression levels of the transduced exogenous gene with its product were maintained for at least 56days. The fibrinogen concentration modified the adipogenic differentiation of ccdPAs and their exogenous gene expression levels, and the levels of exogenously transduced gene expression at the different fibrinogen concentrations were dependent on the extent of adipogenic differentiation in the gel. These results indicate that fibrin glue helps to maintain the high adipogenic potential of cultured adipocytes after passaging in a 3D culture system, and suggests that once they are successfully implanted at the transplantation site, the cells exhibit increased expression of the transduced gene with adipogenic differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Host resistance to viral infection requires type I (α/β) and II (γ) interferon (IFN) production. Another important defense mechanism is the degradative activity of macroautophagy (herein autophagy), mediated by the coordinated action of evolutionarily conserved autophagy proteins (Atg). We show that the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1 protein complex, whose prior known function is in autophagosome formation, is required for IFNγ-mediated host defense against murine norovirus (MNV) infection. Importantly, the direct antiviral activity of IFNγ against MNV in macrophages required Atg5-Atg12, Atg7, and Atg16L1, but not induction of autophagy, the degradative activity of lysosomal proteases, fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, or the Atg8-processing protein Atg4B. IFNγ, via Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1, inhibited formation of the membranous cytoplasmic MNV replication complex, where Atg16L1 localized. Thus, the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1 complex performs a pivotal, nondegradative role in IFNγ-mediated antiviral defense, establishing that multicellular organisms have evolved to use portions of the autophagy pathway machinery in a cassette-like fashion for host defense.

Abstract: Successful use of stem cell-based therapeutic products is conditioned by transplantation of optimized cells in permissive microenvironment. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fates are tightly regulated by humoral factors, cellular interactions and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which are complex polysaccharides with structural heterogeneity. During osteogenesis, a temporally controlled expression of particular GAG species is required to interact with specific growth promoting and differentiating factors to regulate their biological activities. As a comparative tool to study natural GAG, we used structurally and functionally related synthetic GAG mimetics. One of these compounds [OTR4120] was previously shown to stimulate bone repair in rat models. Here, we demonstrate that structurally distinct GAG mimetics stimulate differentially clonogenicity, proliferation, migration and osteogenic phenotype of MSC in vitro, according to their specific chemical signature, underlying the role of sulfate and acetyl groups in specific interactions with heparin binding factors (HBF). These effects are dependent on FGF-2 interactions since they are inhibited by a FGF receptor 1 signaling pathway blocker. These data suggest that the in vivo [OTR4120] bone regenerative effect could be due to its ability to induce MSC migration and osteogenic differentiation. To conclude, we provide evidences showing that GAG mimetics may have great interest for bone regeneration therapy and represent an alternative to exogenous growth factor treatments to optimize potential therapeutic properties of MSC.

Abstract: The capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to survive and engraft in the target tissue may lead to promising therapeutic effects. However, the fact that the majority of MSCs die during the first few days following transplantation complicates cell therapy. Hence, it is necessary to strengthen the stem cells to withstand the rigors of the microenvironment to improve the efficacy of cell therapy. In this study, we manipulated MSCs to express a cytoprotective factor, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), to address this issue. Full-length cDNA of human HO-1 was isolated and cloned into TOPO vector by TOPO cloning reaction. Then, the construct was ligated to gateway adapted adenovirus expression vector by LR recombination reaction. Afterwards, the recombinant virus expressing HO-1 was produced in appropriate mammalian cell line and used to infect MSCs. The HO-1 engineered MSCs were exposed to hypoxic and oxidative stress conditions followed by evaluation of the cells’ viability and apoptosis. Transient expression of HO-1 was detected within MSCs. It was observed that HO-1 expression could protect MSCs against cell death and the apoptosis triggered by hypoxic and oxidative stress conditions. The MSCs-HO-1 retained their ability to differentiate into adipogenic, chondrogenic, or osteogenic lineages. These findings could be applied as a strategy for prevention of graft cell death in MSCs-based cell therapy and is a good demonstration of how an understanding of cellular stress responses can be used for practical applications.

Abstract: The mitochondrial 70-kDa heat shock protein (mtHsp70), also known in humans as mortalin, is a central component of the mitochondrial protein import motor and plays a key role in the folding of matrix-localized mitochondrial proteins. MtHsp70 is assisted by a member of the 40-kDa heat shock protein co-chaperone family named Tid1 and a nucleotide exchange factor. Whereas, yeast mtHsp70 has been extensively studied in the context of protein import in the mitochondria, and the bacterial 70-kDa heat shock protein was recently shown to act as an ATP-fuelled unfolding enzyme capable of detoxifying stably misfolded polypeptides into harmless natively refolded proteins, little is known about the molecular functions of the human mortalin in protein homeostasis. Here, we developed novel and efficient purification protocols for mortalin and the two spliced versions of Tid1, Tid1-S, and Tid1-L and showed that mortalin can mediate the in vitro ATP-dependent reactivation of stable-preformed heat-denatured model aggregates, with the assistance of Mge1 and either Tid1-L or Tid1-S co-chaperones or yeast Mdj1. Thus, in addition of being a central component of the protein import machinery, human mortalin together with Tid1, may serve as a protein disaggregating machine which, for lack of Hsp100/ClpB disaggregating co-chaperones, may carry alone the scavenging of toxic protein aggregates in stressed, diseased, or aging human mitochondria.

Abstract: The carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) is an Hsp70 co-chaperone and a U-box ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in protein quality control in higher eukaryotes. The yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is the only known hemiascomycete where a CHIP ortholog is found. Here, we characterize Y. lipolytica’s CHIP ortholog (Yl.Chn1p) and document its interactions with components of the protein quality control machinery. We show that Yl.Chn1p is non-essential unless Y. lipolytica is severely stressed. We sought for genetic interactions among key components of the Y. lipolytica protein quality control arsenal, including members of the Ssa-family of Hsp70 molecular chaperones, the Yl.Bag1p Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor, the Yl.Chn1p and Yl.Ufd2p U-box ubiquitin ligases, the Yl.Doa10p and Yl.Hrd1p RING-finger ubiquitin ligases, and the Yl.Hsp104p disaggregating molecular chaperone. Remarkably, no synthetic phenotypes were observed among null alleles of the corresponding genes in most cases, suggesting that overlapping pathways efficiently act to enable Y. lipolytica cells to survive under harsh conditions. Yl.Chn1p interacts with mammalian and Saccharomyces cerevisiae members of the Hsp70 family in vitro, and these interactions are differently regulated by Hsp70 co-chaperones. We demonstrate notably that Yl.Chn1p/Ssa1p interaction is Fes1p-dependent and the formation of an Yl.Chn1p/Ssa1p/Sse1p ternary complex. Finally, we show that, similar to Sse1p, Yl.Chn1p can act as a “holdase” to prevent the aggregation of a heat-denatured protein.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic bacterial strains emerge largely due to transfer of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes between bacteria, a process known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci of bacteria and archaea encode a sequence-specific defense mechanism against bacteriophages and constitute a programmable barrier to HGT. However, the impact of CRISPRs on the emergence of virulence is unknown. We programmed the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae with CRISPR sequences that target capsule genes, an essential pneumococcal virulence factor, and show that CRISPR interference can prevent transformation of nonencapsulated, avirulent pneumococci into capsulated, virulent strains during infection in mice. Further, at low frequencies bacteria can lose CRISPR function, acquire capsule genes, and mount a successful infection. These results demonstrate that CRISPR interference can prevent the emergence of virulence in vivo and that strong selective pressure for virulence or antibiotic resistance can lead to CRISPR loss in bacterial pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
The human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV) primarily infect lymphocytes, which must be activated for efficient viral replication. We show that the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 (gp41CD) of both HIV-1 and SIV induces activation of NF-κB, a cellular factor important for proviral genome transcription and lymphocyte activation. This NF-κB activating property localized to a region 12–25 (SIV) or 59–70 (HIV-1) residues from the gp41 membrane-spanning domain. An siRNA-based screen of 42 key NF-κB regulators revealed that gp41CD-mediated activation occurs through the canonical NF-κB pathway via TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). TAK1 activity was required for gp41CD-mediated NF-κB activation, and HIV-1-derived gp41CD physically interacted with TAK1 through the same region required for NF-κB activation. Importantly, an NF-κB activation-deficient HIV-1 mutant exhibited increased dependence on cellular activation for replication. These findings demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved role for gp41CD in activating NF-κB to promote infection.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins are ubiquitous in all three domains (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya) and possess molecular chaperone activity by binding to unfolded polypeptides and preventing aggregation of proteins in vitro. The functions of a small heat shock protein (S.so-HSP20) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 have not been described. In the present study, we used real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis to measure mRNA expression of S.so-HSP20 in S. solfataricus P2 and found that it was induced by temperatures that were substantially lower (60°C) or higher (80°C) than the optimal temperature for S. solfataricus P2 (75°C). The expression of S.so-HSP20 mRNA was also up-regulated by cold shock (4°C). Escherichia coli cells expressing S.so-HSP20 showed greater thermotolerance in response to temperature shock (50°C, 4°C). By assaying enzyme activities, S.so-HSP20 was found to promote the proper folding of thermo-denatured citrate synthase and insulin B chain. These results suggest that S.so-HSP20 promotes thermotolerance and engages in chaperone-like activity during the stress response.

Abstract: We previously reported the presence of a mtDNA mutation hotspot in UV-induced premalignant and malignant skin tumors in hairless mice. We have modeled this change (9821insA) in murine cybrid cells and demonstrated that this alteration in mtDNA associated with mtBALB haplotype can alter the biochemical characteristics of cybrids and subsequently can contribute to significant changes in their behavioral capabilities. This study shows that changes in mtDNA can produce differences in expression levels of specific nuclear-encoded genes, which are capable of triggering the phenotypes such as seen in malignant cells. From a potential list of differentially expressed genes discovered by microarray analysis, we selected MMP-9 and Col1a1 for further studies. Real-time PCR confirmed up-regulation of MMP-9 and down-regulation of Col1a1 in cybrids harboring the mtDNA associated with the skin tumors. These cybrids also showed significantly increased migration and invasion abilities compared to wild type. The non-specific MMP inhibitor, GM6001, was able to inhibit migratory and invasive abilities of the 9821insA cybrids confirming a critical role of MMPs in cellular motility. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a key transcription factor for production of MMPs. An inhibitor of NF-κB activation, Bay 11-7082, was able to inhibit the expression of MMP-9 and ultimately decrease migration and invasion of mutant cybrids containing 9821insA. These studies confirm a role of NF-κB in the regulation of MMP-9 expression and through this regulation modulates the migratory and invasive capabilities of cybrids with mutant mtDNA. Enhanced migration and invasion abilities caused by up-regulated MMP-9 may contribute to the tumorigenic phenotypic characteristics of mutant cybrids.

Abstract: Regulation of membrane transport is controlled by small G proteins, which include members of the Rab and Arf families. Whereas the role of the classic Arf family members are well characterized, many of the Arf-like proteins (Arls) remain poorly defined. Here we show that Arl5a and Arl5b are localised to the trans-Golgi in mammalian cells, and furthermore have identified a role for Arl5b in the regulation of retrograde membrane transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The constitutively active Arl5b (Q70L)-GFP mutant was localised efficiently to the Golgi in HeLa cells whereas the dominant-negative Arl5b (T30N)-GFP mutant was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and resulted in perturbation of the Golgi apparatus. Stable HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged Arl5b (Q70L) showed an increased rate of endosome-to-Golgi transport of the membrane cargo TGN38 compared with control HeLa cells. Depletion of Arl5b by RNAi resulted in an alteration in the intracellular distribution of mannose-6-phosphate receptor, and significantly reduced the endosome-to-TGN transport of the membrane cargo TGN38 and of Shiga toxin, but had no affect on the anterograde transport of the cargo E-cadherin. Collectively these results suggest that Arl5b is a TGN-localised small G protein that plays a key role in regulating transport along the endosome-TGN pathway.

Abstract: Streptococcus intermedius is a facultatively anaerobic, opportunistic pathogen that causes purulent infections and abscess formation. The DnaK chaperone system has been characterized in several pathogenic bacteria and seems to have important functions in stress resistance and pathogenicity. However, the role of DnaK in S. intermedius remains unclear. Therefore, we constructed a dnaK knockout mutant that exhibited slow growth, thermosensitivity, accumulation of GroEL in the cell, and reduced cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells. The level of secretion of a major pathogenic factor, intermedilysin, was not affected by dnaK mutation. We further examined the function and property of the S. intermedius DnaK chaperone system by using Escherichia coli ΔdnaK and ΔrpoH mutant strains. S. intermedius DnaK could not complement the thermosensitivity of E. coli ΔdnaK mutant. However, the intact S. intermedius DnaK chaperone system could complement the thermosensitivity and acid sensitivity of E. coli ΔdnaK mutant. The S. intermedius DnaK chaperone system could regulate the activity and stability of the heat shock transcription factor σ32 in E. coli, although S. intermedius does not utilize σ32 for heat shock transcription. The S. intermedius DnaK chaperone system was also able to efficiently eliminate the aggregated proteins from ΔrpoH mutant cells. Overall, our data showed that the S. intermedius DnaK chaperone system has important functions in quality control of cellular proteins but has less participation in the modulation of expression of pathogenic factors.

Abstract: Background
Tescalcin is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1). Levay and Slepak recently proposed a role for tescalcin in megakaryopoiesis that was independent of NHE1 activity. Their studies using K562 and HEL cell lines, and human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells suggested an essential role for tescalcin in megakaryocyte differentiation.
Objective
To study the role of tescalcin in megakaryocyte development using a murine model of megakaryopoiesis.
Methods
We generated a mouse with targeted disruption of tescalcin and investigated megakaryocyte development.
Results
Tescalcin-deficient mice had a normal number of megakaryocytes and platelets. The morphology, polyploidization profile, and expression of Fli-1 in bone marrow-derived megakaryocytes were also normal.
Conclusion
Tescalcin does not appear to be necessary for normal megakaryocyte development.

Abstract: Tumor hypoxia has been considered to be a potential therapeutic target, because hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors and is associated with their malignant phenotype. In the present study, we investigated the antitumor effect of a novel hypoxic cytotoxin, 3-[2-hydroxyethyl(methyl)amino]-2-quinoxalinecarbonitrile 1,4-dioxide (TX-2098) in inhibiting the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and consequently vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) expression in pancreatic cancer. The antitumor effects of TX-2098 under hypoxia were tested against various human pancreatic cancer cell lines using WST-8 assay. VEGF protein induced pancreatic cancer was determined on cell-free supernatant by ELISA. Moreover, nude mice bearing subcutaneously (s.c.) or orthotopically implanted human SUIT-2 were treated with TX-2098. Tumor volume, survival and expression of HIF-1 and associated molecules were evaluated in treatment versus control groups. In vitro, TX-2098 inhibited the proliferation of various pancreatic cancer cell lines. In s.c model, tumors from nude mice injected with pancreatic cancer cells and treated with TX-2098 showed significant reductions in volume (P<0.01 versus control). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that TX-2098 significantly inhibited mRNA expression of the HIF-1 associated molecules, VEGF, glucose transporter 1 and Aldolase A (P<0.01 versus control). These treatments also prolong the survival in orthotopic models. These results suggest that the effect of TX-2098 in pancreatic cancer might be correlated with the expression of VEGF and HIF-1 targeted molecules.

Abstract: Mechanical strain has been reported to affect the proliferation/differentiation of many cell types; however, the effects of mechanotransduction on self-renewal as well as pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells remains unknown. To investigate the effects of mechanical strain on mouse ES cell fate, we examined the expression of Nanog, which is an essential regulator of self-renewal and pluripotency as well as Nanog-associated intracellular signaling during uniaxial cyclic mechanical strain. The mouse ES cell line, CCE was plated onto elastic membranes, and we applied 10% strain at 0.17Hz. The expression of Nanog was reduced during ES cell differentiation in response to the withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF); however, two days of cyclic mechanical strain attenuated this reduction of Nanog expression. On the other hand, the cyclic mechanical strain promoted PI3K-Akt signaling, which is reported as an upstream of Nanog transcription. The cyclic mechanical strain-induced Akt phosphorylation was blunted by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Furthermore, cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, also inhibited the mechanical strain-induced increase in phospho-Akt. These findings imply that mechanical force plays a role in regulating Nanog expression in ES cells through the actin cytoskeleton-PI3K-Akt signaling.

Abstract: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited cause of kidney failure and characterized by the formation of multiple fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. It is believed that environmental factors may play an important role in the disease progression. However, the molecular identity of autocrine/paracrine factors influencing cyst formation is largely unknown. In this study, we identified transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) secreted by normal human kidney (NHK) and ADPKD cells as an inhibitor of cystogenesis in 3D culture system using ADPKD cells from human kidneys. TGF-β2 was identified in conditioned media (CM) of NHK and ADPKD cells as a latent factor activated by heat in vitro. While all TGF-β isoforms recombinant proteins (TGF-β1, -β2, or -β3) displayed a similar inhibitory effect on cyst formation, TGF-β2 was the predominant isoform detected in CM. The involvement of TGF-β2 in the suppression of cyst formation was demonstrated by using a TGF-β2 specific blocking antibody and a TGF-β receptor I kinase inhibitor. TGF-β2 inhibited cyst formation by a mechanism other than activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase that mediated cell death in ADPKD cells. Further, we found that TGF-β2 modulated expression of various genes involved in cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions and extracellular matrix proteins that may play a role in the regulation of cystogenesis. Collectively, our results suggest that TGF-β2 secreted by renal epithelial cells may be an inhibitor of cystogenesis influencing the progression of ADPKD.

Abstract: Dystroglycan (DG) is an extracellular receptor composed of two subunits, α-DG and β-DG, connected through the α-DG C-terminal domain and the β-DG N-terminal domain. We report an alanine scanning of all DG cysteine residues performed on DG-GFP constructs overexpressed in 293-Ebna cells, demonstrating that Cys-669 and Cys-713, both located within the β-DG N-terminal domain, are key residues for the DG precursor cleavage and trafficking, but not for the interaction between the two DG subunits. In addition, we have used immunprecipitation and confocal microscopy showing that ERp57, a member of the disulfide isomerase family involved in glycoprotein folding, is associated and colocalizes immunohistochemically with β-DG in the ER and at the plasma membrane of 293-Ebna cells. The β-DG–ERp57 complex also included α-DG. DG mutants, unable to undergo the precursor cleavage, were still associated to ERp57. β-DG and ERp57 were also co-immunoprecipitated in rat heart and kidney tissues. In vitro, a mutant ERp57, mimicking the reduced form of the wild-type protein, interacts directly with the recombinant N-terminal domain of both α-DG and β-DG with apparent dissociation constant values in the micromolar range. ERp57 is likely to be involved in the DG processing/maturation pathway, but its association to the mature DG complex might also suggest some further functional role that needs to be investigated.
