Abstract: Summary
The regeneration capacity of neonatal mouse heart is controversial. In addition, whether epicardial cells provide a progenitor pool for de novo heart regeneration is incompletely defined. Following apical resection of the neonatal mouse heart, we observed limited regeneration potential. Fate-mapping of Tbx18MerCreMer mice revealed that newly formed coronary vessels and a limited number of cardiomyocytes were derived from the T-box transcription factor 18 (Tbx18) lineage. However, further lineage tracing with SM-MHCCreERT2 and Nfactc1Cre mice revealed that the new smooth muscle and endothelial cells are in fact derivatives of pre-existing coronary vessels. Our data show that neonatal mouse heart can regenerate but that its potential is limited. Moreover, although epicardial cells are multipotent during embryogenesis, their contribution to heart repair through “stem” or “progenitor” cell conversion is minimal after birth. These observations suggest that early embryonic heart development and postnatal heart regeneration are distinct biological processes. Multipotency of epicardial cells is significantly decreased after birth.

Abstract: Summary
The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a biflagellated cell with two actin genes: one encoding a conventional actin (IDA5) and the other encoding a divergent novel actin-like protein (NAP1). Here, we probe how actin redundancy contributes to flagellar assembly. Disrupting a single actin allows complete flagellar assembly. However, when disrupting both actins using latrunculin B (LatB) treatment on the nap1 mutant background, we find that actins are necessary for flagellar growth from newly synthesized limiting flagellar proteins. Under total actin disruption, transmission electron microscopy identified an accumulation of Golgi-adjacent vesicles. We also find that there is a mislocalization of a key transition zone gating and ciliopathy protein, NPHP-4. Our experiments demonstrate that each stage of flagellar biogenesis requires redundant actin function to varying degrees, with an absolute requirement for these actins in transport of Golgi-adjacent vesicles and flagellar incorporation of newly synthesized proteins.

Abstract: Summary
We remember our lives as sequences of events, but it is unclear how these memories are controlled during retrieval. In rats, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is positioned to influence sequence memory through extensive top-down inputs to regions heavily interconnected with the hippocampus, notably the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus (RE) and perirhinal cortex (PER). Here, we used an hM4Di synaptic-silencing approach to test our hypothesis that specific mPFC→RE and mPFC→PER projections regulate sequence memory retrieval. First, we found non-overlapping populations of mPFC cells project to RE and PER. Second, suppressing mPFC activity impaired sequence memory. Third, inhibiting mPFC→RE and mPFC→PER pathways effectively abolished sequence memory. Finally, a sequential lag analysis showed that the mPFC→RE pathway contributes to a working memory retrieval strategy, whereas the mPFC→PER pathway supports a temporal context memory retrieval strategy. These findings demonstrate that mPFC→RE and mPFC→PER pathways serve as top-down mechanisms that control distinct sequence memory retrieval strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most invasive and metastatic cancers and has a dismal 5-year survival rate. We show that N-WASP drives pancreatic cancer metastasis, with roles in both chemotaxis and matrix remodeling. lysophosphatidic acid, a signaling lipid abundant in blood and ascites fluid, is both a mitogen and chemoattractant for cancer cells. Pancreatic cancer cells break lysophosphatidic acid down as they respond to it, setting up a self-generated gradient driving tumor egress. N-WASP-depleted cells do not recognize lysophosphatidic acid gradients, leading to altered RhoA activation, decreased contractility and traction forces, and reduced metastasis. We describe a signaling loop whereby N-WASP and the endocytic adapter SNX18 promote lysophosphatidic acid-induced RhoA-mediated contractility and force generation by controlling lysophosphatidic acid receptor recycling and preventing degradation. This chemotactic loop drives collagen remodeling, tumor invasion, and metastasis and could be an important target against pancreatic cancer spread.

Abstract: For physiological or pathological understanding of bone disease caused by abnormal behavior of osteoclasts (OCs), functional studies of molecules that regulate the generation and action of OCs are required. In a microarray approach, we found the suppression of tumorigenicity 5 (ST5) gene is upregulated by receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), the OC differentiation factor. Although the roles of ST5 in cancer and β-cells have been reported, the function of ST5 in bone cells has not yet been investigated. Knockdown of ST5 by siRNA reduced OC differentiation from primary precursors. Moreover, ST5 downregulation decreased expression of NFATc1, a key transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis. In contrast, overexpression of ST5 resulted in the opposite phenotype of ST5 knockdown. In immunocytochemistry experiments, the ST5 protein is co-localized with Src in RANKL-committed cells. In addition, ST5 enhanced activation of Src and Syk, a Src substrate, in response to RANKL. ST5 reduction caused a decrease in RANKL-evoked calcium oscillation and inhibited translocation of NFATc1 into the nucleus. Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence of ST5 involvement in positive regulation of osteoclastogenesis via Src/Syk/calcium signaling.

Abstract: Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) are promising for regenerating degenerated intervertebral discs (IVDs), but the low efficiency of nucleus pulposus (NP)-specific differentiation limits their clinical applications. The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway is important in NP-specific differentiation of ADSCs, and Smoothened Agonist (SAG) is a highly specific and effective agonist of Shh signaling. In this study, we proposed a new differentiation strategy with the use of the small molecule SAG. The NP-specific differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis of ADSCs were measured in vitro, and the regenerative effects of SAG pretreated ADSCs in degenerated IVDs were verified in vivo. The results showed that the combination of SAG and transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3) is able to increase the ECM synthesis of ADSCs. In addition, the gene and protein expression levels of NP-specific markers were increased by treatment with SAG and TGF-β3. Furthermore, SAG pretreated ADSCs can also improve the disc height, water content, ECM content, and structure of degenerated IVDs in vivo. Our new differentiation scheme has high efficiency in inducing NP-specific differentiation of ADSCs and is promising for stem cell-based treatment of degenerated IVDs.

Abstract: Summary
The lymphatic vasculature requires intraluminal valves to maintain forward lymph flow. Lymphatic valves form and are constantly maintained by oscillatory fluid flow throughout life, yet the earliest steps of how lymphatic endothelial cells are able to respond to fluid shear stress remain unknown. Here, we show that the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin is required for the upregulation of valve-specific transcription factors. Conditional deletion of VE-cadherin in vivo prevented valve formation in the embryo and caused postnatal regression of nearly all lymphatic valves in multiple tissues. Since VE-cadherin is known to signal through β-catenin and the VEGFR/AKT pathway, each pathway was probed. Expression of a constitutively active β-catenin mutant or direct pharmacologic activation of AKT in vivo significantly rescued valve regression in the VE-cadherin-deficient lymphatic vessels. In conclusion, VE-cadherin-dependent signaling is required for lymphatic valve formation and maintenance and therapies to augment downstream pathways hold potential to treat lymphedema in patients.

Abstract: Summary
Target RNA binding to crRNA-bound type III-A CRISPR-Cas multi-subunit Csm surveillance complexes activates cyclic-oligoadenylate (cAn) formation from ATP subunits positioned within the composite pair of Palm domain pockets of the Csm1 subunit. The generated cAn second messenger in turn targets the CARF domain of trans-acting RNase Csm6, triggering its HEPN domain-based RNase activity. We have undertaken cryo-EM studies on multi-subunit Thermococcus onnurineus Csm effector ternary complexes, as well as X-ray studies on Csm1–Csm4 cassette, both bound to substrate (AMPPNP), intermediates (pppAn), and products (cAn), to decipher mechanistic aspects of cAn formation and release. A network of intermolecular hydrogen bond alignments accounts for the observed adenosine specificity, with ligand positioning dictating formation of linear pppAn intermediates and subsequent cAn formation by cyclization. We combine our structural results with published functional studies to highlight mechanistic insights into the role of the Csm effector complex in mediating the cAn signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes (ETMRs) are highly lethal infant brain cancers with characteristic amplification of Chr19q13.41 miRNA cluster (C19MC) and enrichment of pluripotency factor LIN28A. Here we investigated C19MC oncogenic mechanisms and discovered a C19MC-LIN28A-MYCN circuit fueled by multiple complex regulatory loops including an MYCN core transcriptional network and super-enhancers resulting from long-range MYCN DNA interactions and C19MC gene fusions. Our data show that this powerful oncogenic circuit, which entraps an early neural lineage network, is potently abrogated by bromodomain inhibitor JQ1, leading to ETMR cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms coordinating pancreatic β cell metabolism with insulin secretion are essential for glucose homeostasis. One key mechanism of β cell nutrient sensing uses the mitochondrial GTP (mtGTP) cycle. In this cycle, mtGTP synthesized by succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is hydrolyzed via mitochondrial PEPCK (PEPCK-M) to make phosphoenolpyruvate, a high-energy metabolite that integrates TCA cycling and anaplerosis with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Several strategies, including xenotopic overexpression of yeast mitochondrial GTP/GDP exchanger (GGC1) and human ATP and GTP-specific SCS isoforms, demonstrated the importance of the mtGTP cycle. These studies confirmed that mtGTP triggers and amplifies normal GSIS and rescues defects in GSIS both in vitro and in vivo. Increased mtGTP synthesis enhanced calcium oscillations during GSIS. mtGTP also augmented mitochondrial mass, increased insulin granule number, and membrane proximity without triggering de-differentiation or metabolic fragility. These data highlight the importance of the mtGTP signal in nutrient sensing, insulin secretion, mitochondrial maintenance, and β cell health.

Abstract: Summary
The renal corpuscle of the kidney comprises a glomerular vasculature embraced by podocytes and supported by mesangial myofibroblasts, which ensure plasma filtration at the podocyte-generated slit diaphragm. With a spectrum of podocyte-expressed gene mutations causing chronic disease, an enhanced understanding of podocyte development and function to create relevant in vitro podocyte models is a clinical imperative. To characterize podocyte development, scRNA-seq was performed on human fetal kidneys, identifying distinct transcriptional signatures accompanying the differentiation of functional podocytes from progenitors. Interestingly, organoid-generated podocytes exhibited highly similar, progressive transcriptional profiles despite an absence of the vasculature, although abnormal gene expression was pinpointed in late podocytes. On transplantation into mice, organoid-derived podocytes recruited the host vasculature and partially corrected transcriptional profiles. Thus, human podocyte development is mostly intrinsically regulated and vascular interactions refine maturation. These studies support the application of organoid-derived podocytes to model disease and to restore or replace normal kidney functions.

Abstract: Summary
A species barrier for the influenza A virus is the differential expression of sialic acid, which can either be α2,3-linked for avians or α2,6-linked for human viruses. The influenza A virus hosts also express other species-specific sialic acid derivatives. One major modification at C-5 is N-glycolyl (NeuGc), instead of N-acetyl (NeuAc). N-glycolyl is mammalian specific and expressed in pigs and horses, but not in humans, ferrets, seals, or dogs. Hemagglutinin (HA) adaptation to either N-acetyl or N-glycolyl is analyzed on a sialoside microarray containing both α2,3- and α2,6-linkage modifications on biologically relevant N-glycans. Binding studies reveal that avian, human, and equine HAs bind either N-glycolyl or N-acetyl. Structural data on N-glycolyl binding HA proteins of both H5 and H7 origin describe this specificity. Neuraminidases can cleave N-glycolyl efficiently, and tissue-binding studies reveal strict species specificity. The exclusive manner in which influenza A viruses differentiate between N-glycolyl and N-acetyl is indicative of selection.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian gametogenesis involves dramatic and tightly regulated chromatin remodeling, whose regulatory pathways remain largely unexplored. Here, we generate a comprehensive high-resolution structural and functional atlas of mouse spermatogenesis by combining in situ chromosome conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and meiotic cohesins, coupled with confocal and super-resolution microscopy. Spermatogonia presents well-defined compartment patterns and topological domains. However, chromosome occupancy and compartmentalization are highly re-arranged during prophase I, with cohesins bound to active promoters in DNA loops out of the chromosomal axes. Compartment patterns re-emerge in round spermatids, where cohesin occupancy correlates with transcriptional activity of key developmental genes. The compact sperm genome contains compartments with actively transcribed genes but no fine-scale topological domains, concomitant with the presence of protamines. Overall, we demonstrate how genome-wide cohesin occupancy and transcriptional activity is associated with three-dimensional (3D) remodeling during spermatogenesis, ultimately reprogramming the genome for the next generation.

Abstract: Summary
Despite being fundamentally important and having direct therapeutic implications, the functional genomics of the clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens is often impeded by the lack of genome-editing tools. Here, we report the establishment of a highly efficient, in situ genome-editing technique applicable in clinical and environmental isolates of the prototypic MDR pathogen P. aeruginosa by harnessing the endogenous type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems. Using this approach, we generate various reverse mutations in an epidemic MDR genotype, PA154197, and identify underlying resistance mechanisms that involve the extensive synergy among three different resistance determinants. Screening a series of “ancestor” mutant lines uncovers the remarkable sensitivity of the MDR line PA154197 to a class of small, cationic peptidomimetics, which sensitize PA154197 cells to antibiotics by perturbing outer-membrane permeability. These studies provide a framework for molecular genetics and anti-resistance drug discovery for clinically isolated MDR pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
We performed genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of 133 combined hepatocellular and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-ICC) cases, including separate, combined, and mixed subtypes. Integrative comparison of cHCC-ICC with hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma revealed that combined and mixed type cHCC-ICCs are distinct subtypes with different clinical and molecular features. Integrating laser microdissection, cancer cell fraction analysis, and single nucleus sequencing, we revealed both mono- and multiclonal origins in the separate type cHCC-ICCs, whereas combined and mixed type cHCC-ICCs were all monoclonal origin. Notably, cHCC-ICCs showed significantly higher expression of Nestin, suggesting Nestin may serve as a biomarker for diagnosing cHCC-ICC. Our results provide important biological and clinical insights into cHCC-ICC.

Abstract: Summary
In response to foreign and endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), protein kinase R (PKR) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) reprogram translation in mammalian cells. PKR inhibits translation initiation through eIF2α phosphorylation, which triggers stress granule (SG) formation and promotes translation of stress responsive mRNAs. The mechanisms of RNase L-driven translation repression, its contribution to SG assembly, and its regulation of dsRNA stress-induced mRNAs are unknown. We demonstrate that RNase L drives translational shut-off in response to dsRNA by promoting widespread turnover of mRNAs. This alters stress granule assembly and reprograms translation by allowing translation of mRNAs resistant to RNase L degradation, including numerous antiviral mRNAs such as interferon (IFN)-β. Individual cells differentially activate dsRNA responses revealing variation that can affect cellular outcomes. This identifies bulk mRNA degradation and the resistance of antiviral mRNAs as the mechanism by which RNase L reprograms translation in response to dsRNA.

GAPDH is emerging as a key player in T cell development and function. To investigate the role of GAPDH in T cells, we generated a transgenic mouse model overexpressing GAPDH in the T cell lineage. Aged mice developed a peripheral Tfh-like lymphoma that recapitulated key molecular, pathological, and immunophenotypic features of human angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL). GAPDH induced non-canonical NF-κB pathway activation in mouse T cells, which was strongly activated in human AITL. We developed a NIK inhibitor to reveal that targeting the NF-κB pathway prolonged AITL-bearing mouse survival alone and in combination with anti-PD-1. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting NF-κB signaling in AITL and provide a model for future AITL therapeutic investigations.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are frequently the most abundant immune cells in cancers and are associated with poor survival. Here, we generated TAM molecular signatures from K14cre;Cdh1flox/flox;Trp53flox/flox (KEP) and MMTV-NeuT (NeuT) transgenic mice that resemble human invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and HER2+ tumors, respectively. Determination of TAM-specific signatures requires comparison with healthy mammary tissue macrophages to avoid overestimation of gene expression differences. TAMs from the two models feature a distinct transcriptomic profile, suggesting that the cancer subtype dictates their phenotype. The KEP-derived signature reliably correlates with poor overall survival in ILC but not in triple-negative breast cancer patients, indicating that translation of murine TAM signatures to patients is cancer subtype dependent. Collectively, we show that a transgenic mouse tumor model can yield a TAM signature relevant for human breast cancer outcome prognosis and provide a generalizable strategy for determining and applying immune cell signatures provided the murine model reflects the human disease.

Abstract: Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) that regulates vascular signalling transduction, vasocontraction and vasodilation. Although the physiological role of ROS in endothelial cells is acknowledged, the mechanisms underlying H2O2 regulation of signalling in native, fully-differentiated endothelial cells is unresolved. In the present study, the effects of H2O2 on Ca2+ signalling were investigated in the endothelium of intact rat mesenteric arteries. Spontaneous local Ca2+ signals and acetylcholine evoked Ca2+ increases were inhibited by H2O2. H2O2 inhibition of acetylcholine-evoked Ca2+ signals was reversed by catalase. H2O2 exerts its inhibition on the IP3 receptor as Ca2+ release evoked by photolysis of caged IP3 was supressed by H2O2. H2O2 suppression of IP3-evoked Ca2+ signalling may be mediated by mitochondria. H2O2 depolarized mitochondria membrane potential. Acetylcholine-evoked Ca2+ release was inhibited by depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential by the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or complex 1 inhibitor, rotenone. We propose that the suppression of IP3-evoked Ca2+ release by H2O2 arises from the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. These results suggest that mitochondria may protect themselves against Ca2+ overload during IP3-linked Ca2+ signals by a H2O2 mediated negative feedback depolarization of the organelle and inhibition of IP3-evoked Ca2+ release.

Abstract: Summary
Analysis of gene expression in single cells allows for decomposition of cellular states as low-dimensional latent spaces. However, the interpretation and validation of these spaces remains a challenge. Here, we present scCoGAPS, which defines latent spaces from a source single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, and projectR, which evaluates these latent spaces in independent target datasets via transfer learning. Application of developing mouse retina to scRNA-Seq reveals intrinsic relationships across biological contexts and assays while avoiding batch effects and other technical features. We compare the dimensions learned in this source dataset to adult mouse retina, a time-course of human retinal development, select scRNA-seq datasets from developing brain, chromatin accessibility data, and a murine-cell type atlas to identify shared biological features. These tools lay the groundwork for exploratory analysis of scRNA-seq data via latent space representations, enabling a shift in how we compare and identify cells beyond reliance on marker genes or ensemble molecular identity.

Abstract: Summary
To identify therapeutic targets in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we chemically interrogated 200 sequenced primary specimens. Mubritinib, a known ERBB2 inhibitor, elicited strong anti-leukemic effects in vitro and in vivo. In the context of AML, mubritinib functions through ubiquinone-dependent inhibition of electron transport chain (ETC) complex I activity. Resistance to mubritinib characterized normal CD34+ hematopoietic cells and chemotherapy-sensitive AMLs, which displayed transcriptomic hallmarks of hypoxia. Conversely, sensitivity correlated with mitochondrial function-related gene expression levels and characterized a large subset of chemotherapy-resistant AMLs with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) hyperactivity. Altogether, our work thus identifies an ETC complex I inhibitor and reveals the genetic landscape of OXPHOS dependency in AML.

Abstract: The fungal cell wall is the first point of contact between fungal pathogens and host organisms. It serves as a protective barrier against biotic and abiotic stresses and as a signal to the host that a fungal pathogen is present. The fungal cell wall is made predominantly of carbohydrates and glycoproteins, many of which serve as binding receptors for host defence molecules or activate host immune responses through interactions with membrane-bound receptors. Plant defensins are a large family of cationic antifungal peptides that protect plants against fungal disease. Binding of the plant defensin NaD1 to the fungal cell wall has been described but the specific component of the cell wall with which this interaction occurred was unknown. The effect of binding was also unclear, that is whether the plant defensin used fungal cell wall components as a recognition motif for the plant to identify potential pathogens or if the cell wall acted to protect the fungus against the defensin. Here we describe the interaction between the fungal cell wall polysaccharides chitin and β-glucan with NaD1 and other plant defensins. We discovered that the β-glucan layer protects the fungus against plant defensins and the loss of activity experienced by many cationic antifungal peptides at elevated salt concentrations is due to sequestration by fungal cell wall polysaccharides. This has limited the development of cationic antifungal peptides for the treatment of systemic fungal diseases in humans as the level of salt in serum is enough to inactivate most cationic peptides.

Abstract: Summary
Centrosomes, the predominant sites of microtubule nucleation and anchorage, coordinate spindle assembly and cell division in animal cells. At the onset of mitosis, centrioles accumulate microtubule-organizing pericentriolar material (PCM) in a process termed centrosome maturation. To what extent centrosome maturation depends on the continued activity of mitotic regulators or the presence of centrioles has hitherto been unclear. Using the C. elegans early embryo, we show that PCM expansion requires the Polo-like kinase PLK-1 and CEP192 (SPD-2 in C. elegans), but not its upstream regulator Aurora A (AIR-1), while maintenance of the PCM polymer depends exclusively on PLK-1. SPD-2 and PLK-1 are highly concentrated at centrioles. Unexpectedly, laser microsurgery reveals that while centrioles are required for PCM recruitment and centrosome structural integrity they are dispensable for PCM maintenance. We propose a model whereby centrioles promote centrosome maturation by recruiting PLK-1, but subsequent maintenance occurs via PLK-1 acting directly within the PCM.

Abstract: Summary
In budding yeast, a single DNA double-strand break (DSB) triggers the activation of Mec1ATR-dependent DNA damage checkpoint. After about 12 h, cells turn off the checkpoint signaling and adapt despite the persistence of the DSB. We report that the adaptation involves the autophosphorylation of Mec1 at site S1964. A non-phosphorylatable mec1-S1964A mutant causes cells to arrest permanently in response to a single DSB without affecting the initial kinase activity of Mec1. Autophosphorylation of S1964 is dependent on Ddc1Rad9 and Dpb11TopBP1, and it correlates with the timing of adaptation. We also report that Mec1’s binding partner, Ddc2ATRIP, is an inherently stable protein that is degraded specifically upon DNA damage. Ddc2 is regulated extensively through phosphorylation, which, in turn, regulates the localization of the Mec1-Ddc2 complex to DNA lesions. Taken together, these results suggest that checkpoint response is regulated through the autophosphorylation of Mec1 kinase and through the changes in Ddc2 abundance and phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, withstands diverse environmental stresses in the host. The periplasmic protease HtrA is required only to survive extreme conditions in most bacteria but is predicted to be essential for normal growth in mycobacteria. We confirm that HtrA is indeed essential in Mycobacterium smegmatis and interacts with another essential protein of unknown function, LppZ. However, the loss of any of three unlinked genes, including those encoding Ami3, a peptidoglycan muramidase, and Pmt, a mannosyltransferase, suppresses the essentiality of both HtrA and LppZ, indicating the functional relevance of these genes’ protein products. Our data indicate that HtrA-LppZ is required to counteract the accumulation of active Ami3, which is toxic under the stabilizing influence of Pmt-based mannosylation. This suggests that HtrA-LppZ blocks the toxicity of a cell wall enzyme to maintain mycobacterial homeostasis.

Abstract: Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and regarded as a strong anti-oxidant agent. In this study, we focused on the mechanistic insights involved in the hepato-protective effects of CoQ10 against hepatic ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury. Our results revealed that CoQ10 significantly improved hepatic dysfunctions and oxidative stress caused by IR injury. Interestingly, as compared to IR subjected rat, CoQ10 inhibited apoptosis by marked down-regulation of both Bax and PUMA genes while the level of Bcl-2 gene was significantly increased. Moreover, CoQ10 up-regulated PI3K, Akt and mTOR protein expressions while it inhibited the expression of both GSK-3β and β-catenin. Additionally, CoQ10 restored oxidant/antioxidant balance via marked activated Nrf-2 protein as well as up-regulation of both Sirt-1 and FOXO-3 genes. Moreover, CoQ10 strongly inhibited inflammatory response through down-regulation of NF-κB-p65 and decrease both JAK1 and STAT-3 protein expressions with a subsequent modulating circulating inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, histopathological analysis showed that CoQ10 remarkably ameliorated the histopathological damage induced by IR injury. Taken together, our results suggested and proved that CoQ10 provided a hepato-protection against hepatic IR injury via inhibition of apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation and their closed related pathways.

Abstract: Despite decades of research into colorectal cancer (CRC), there is an ongoing need for treatments that are more effective and safer than those currently available. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) show beneficial effects in the context of several diseases, including CRC, and are generally regarded as safe. Here, we isolated a Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR)-derived therapeutic protein, p8, which suppressed CRC proliferation. We found that p8 translocated specifically to the cytosol of DLD-1 cells. Moreover, p8 down-regulated expression of Cyclin B1 and Cdk1, both of which are required for cell cycle progression. We confirmed that p8 exerted strong anti-proliferative activity in a mouse CRC xenograft model. Intraperitoneal injection of recombinant p8 (r-p8) led to a significant reduction (up to 59%) in tumor mass when compared with controls. In recent years, bacterial drug delivery systems (DDSs) have proven to be effective therapeutic agents for acute colitis. Therefore, we aimed to use such systems, particularly LAB, to generate the valuable therapeutic proteins to treat CRC. To this end, we developed a gene expression cassette capable of inducing secretion of large amounts of p8 protein from Pediococcus pentosaceus SL4 (PP). We then confirmed that this protein (PP-p8) exerted anti-proliferative activity in a mouse CRC xenograft model. Oral administration of PP-p8 DDS led to a marked reduction in tumor mass (up to 64%) compared with controls. The PP-p8 DDS using LAB described herein has advantages over other therapeutics; these advantages include improved safety (the protein is a probiotic), cost-free purification, and specific targeting of CRC cells.

Abstract: Summary
The phytohormone auxin plays crucial roles in nearly every aspect of plant growth and development. The auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factor family regulates auxin-responsive gene expression and exhibits nuclear localization in regions of high auxin responsiveness. Here we show that the ARF7 and ARF19 proteins accumulate in micron-sized assemblies within the cytoplasm of tissues with attenuated auxin responsiveness. We found that the intrinsically disordered middle region and the folded PB1 interaction domain of ARFs drive protein assembly formation. Mutation of a single lysine within the PB1 domain abrogates cytoplasmic assemblies, promotes ARF nuclear localization, and results in an altered transcriptome and morphological defects. Our data suggest a model in which ARF nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning regulates auxin responsiveness, providing a mechanism for cellular competence for auxin signaling.

Abstract: Summary
A significant fraction (∼10%) of cancer cells maintain their telomere length via a telomerase-independent mechanism known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). There are no known molecular, ALT-specific, therapeutic targets. We have identified TSPYL5 (testis-specific Y-encoded-like protein 5) as a PML body component, co-localizing with ALT telomeres and critical for ALT+ cell viability. TSPYL5 was described as an inhibitor of the USP7 deubiquitinase. We report that TSPYL5 prevents the poly-ubiquitination of POT1—a shelterin component—and protects POT1 from proteasomal degradation exclusively in ALT+ cells. USP7 depletion rescued POT1 poly-ubiquitination and loss, suggesting that the deubiquitinase activates POT1 E3 ubiquitin ligase(s). Similarly, PML depletion suppressed POT1 poly-ubiquitination, suggesting an interplay between USP7 and PML to trigger POT1 degradation in TSPYL5-depleted ALT+ cells. We demonstrate that ALT telomeres need to be protected from POT1 degradation in ALT-associated PML bodies and identify TSPYL5 as an ALT+ cancer-specific therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Activated macrophages adapt their metabolic pathways to drive the pro-inflammatory phenotype, but little is known about the biochemical underpinnings of this process. Here, we find that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates the pentose phosphate pathway, the serine synthesis pathway, and one-carbon metabolism, the synergism of which drives epigenetic reprogramming for interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression. Glucose-derived ribose and one-carbon units fed by both glucose and serine metabolism are synergistically integrated into the methionine cycle through de novo ATP synthesis and fuel the generation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) during LPS-induced inflammation. Impairment of these metabolic pathways that feed SAM generation lead to anti-inflammatory outcomes, implicating SAM as an essential metabolite for inflammatory macrophages. Mechanistically, SAM generation maintains a relatively high SAM:S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio to support histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation for IL-1β production. We therefore identify a synergistic effect of glucose and amino acid metabolism on orchestrating SAM availability that is intimately linked to the chromatin state for inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we determined the relative importance of different transcriptional mechanisms in the genome-reduced bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae, by employing an array of experimental techniques under multiple genetic and environmental perturbations. Of the 143 genes tested (21% of the bacterium’s annotated proteins), only 55% showed an altered phenotype, highlighting the robustness of biological systems. We identified nine transcription factors (TFs) and their targets, representing 43% of the genome, and 16 regulators that indirectly affect transcription. Only 20% of transcriptional regulation is mediated by canonical TFs when responding to perturbations. Using a Random Forest, we quantified the non-redundant contribution of different mechanisms such as supercoiling, metabolic control, RNA degradation, and chromosome topology to transcriptional changes. Model-predicted gene changes correlate well with experimental data in 95% of the tested perturbations, explaining up to 70% of the total variance when also considering noise. This analysis highlights the importance of considering non-TF-mediated regulation when engineering bacteria.

Abstract: Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) is an effective layer of plant defense initiated upon recognition of avirulence (Avr) effectors from pathogens by cognate plant disease resistance (R) proteins. In rice, a large number of R genes have been characterized from various cultivars and have greatly contributed to breeding programs to improve resistance against the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. The extreme diversity of R gene repertoires is thought to be a result of co-evolutionary history between rice and its pathogens including M. oryzae. Here we show that Pii is an allele of Pi5 by DNA sequence characterization and complementation analysis. Pii-1 and Pii-2 cDNAs were cloned by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from the Pii-carrying cultivar Fujisaka5. The complementation test in susceptible rice cultivar Dongjin demonstrated that the rice blast resistance mediated by Pii, similar to Pi5, requires the presence of two nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat genes, Pii-1 and Pii-2. Consistent with our hypothesis that Pi5 and Pii are functionally indistinguishable, the replacement of Pii-1 by Pi5-1 and Pii-2 by Pi5-2, respectively, does not change the level of disease resistance to M. oryzae carrying AVR-Pii. Surprisingly, Exo70F3, required for Pii-mediated resistance, is dispensable for Pi5-mediated resistance. Based on our results, despite similarities observed between Pi5 and Pii, we hypothesize that Pi5 and Pii pairs require partially distinct mechanisms to function.

Abstract: Summary
Spatial sorting to discrete quality control sites in the cell is a process harnessing the toxicity of aberrant proteins. We show that the yeast t-snare phosphoprotein syntaxin5 (Sed5) acts as a key factor in mitigating proteotoxicity and the spatial deposition and clearance of IPOD (insoluble protein deposit) inclusions associates with the disaggregase Hsp104. Sed5 phosphorylation promotes dynamic movement of COPII-associated Hsp104 and boosts disaggregation by favoring anterograde ER-to-Golgi trafficking. Hsp104-associated aggregates co-localize with Sed5 as well as components of the ER, trans Golgi network, and endocytic vesicles, transiently during proteostatic stress, explaining mechanistically how misfolded and aggregated proteins formed at the vicinity of the ER can hitchhike toward vacuolar IPOD sites. Many inclusions become associated with mitochondria in a HOPS/vCLAMP-dependent manner and co-localize with Vps39 (HOPS/vCLAMP) and Vps13, which are proteins providing contacts between vacuole and mitochondria. Both Vps39 and Vps13 are required also for efficient Sed5-dependent clearance of aggregates.

Abstract: Summary
Although double-strand break (DSB) repair is essential for a cell’s survival, little is known about how DSB repair mechanisms are affected by age. Here we characterize the impact of cellular aging on the efficiency of single-strand annealing (SSA), a DSB repair mechanism. We measure SSA repair efficiency in young and old yeast cells and report a 23.4% decline in repair efficiency. This decline is not due to increased use of non-homologous end joining. Instead, we identify increased G1 phase duration in old cells as a factor responsible for the decreased SSA repair efficiency. Expression of 3xCLN2 leads to higher SSA repair efficiency in old cells compared with expression of 1xCLN2, confirming the involvement of cell-cycle regulation in age-associated repair inefficiency. Examining how SSA repair efficiency is affected by sequence heterology, we find that heteroduplex rejection remains high in old cells. Our work provides insights into the links between single-cell aging and DSB repair efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Precise assembly of the sarcomere, a force-generating unit in striated muscles, is critical for muscle contraction. Defective sarcomere organization is linked to myopathies and cachexia. The molecular mechanisms concerning sarcomere assembly are poorly understood. Here, we report that the SUMO-specific isopeptidase SENP3 determines sarcomere assembly by specifically regulating the sarcomeric contractile myosin heavy-chain gene MyHC-II. The contractile ability of mature muscle cells is severely compromised in SENP3-depleted cells. Mechanistically, SENP3 is associated with the SETD7 histone methyltransferase and deSUMOylates SETD7. By recruiting SETD7 to MyHC-II, SENP3 promotes association of SETD7 with transcriptionally active RNA polymerase II and precludes the opposing methyltransferase Suv39h1. Strikingly, SENP3 is degraded in cachexia, characterized by dramatic loss of sarcomeric protein, particularly MyHC-II. SENP3 regulation of SETD7 is impaired in cachexia, leading to perturbed MyHC-II expression and disorganized sarcomeres. Our findings reveal an unanticipated role of SENP3 in sarcomere assembly and cachexia.

Abstract: Summary
During translation, an mRNA is typically occupied by multiple ribosomes sparsely distributed across the coding sequence. This distribution, mediated by slow rates of initiation relative to elongation, ensures that they rarely collide with each other, but given the stochastic nature of protein synthesis, collision events do occur. Recent work from our lab suggested that collisions signal for mRNA degradation through no-go decay (NGD). We have explored the impact of stalling on ribosome function when NGD is compromised and found it to result in +1 frameshifting. We used reporters that limit the number of ribosomes on a transcript to show that +1 frameshifting is induced through ribosome collision in yeast and bacteria. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between ribosome density and frameshifting efficiency. It is thus tempting to speculate that NGD, in addition to its role in mRNA quality control, evolved to cope with stochastic collision events to prevent deleterious frameshifting events.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in cancer immunotherapies make it critical to identify genes that modulate antigen presentation and tumor-immune interactions. We report that DUX4, an early embryonic transcription factor that is normally silenced in somatic tissues, is re-expressed in diverse solid cancers. Both cis-acting inherited genetic variation and somatically acquired mutations in trans-acting repressors contribute to DUX4 re-expression in cancer. Although many DUX4 target genes encode self-antigens, DUX4-expressing cancers were paradoxically characterized by reduced markers of anti-tumor cytolytic activity and lower major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene expression. We demonstrate that DUX4 expression blocks interferon-γ-mediated induction of MHC class I, implicating suppressed antigen presentation in DUX4-mediated immune evasion. Clinical data in metastatic melanoma confirmed that DUX4 expression was associated with significantly reduced progression-free and overall survival in response to anti-CTLA-4. Our results demonstrate that cancers can escape immune surveillance by reactivating a normal developmental pathway and identify a therapeutically relevant mechanism of cell-intrinsic immune evasion.

Abstract: Summary
Asymptomatic and symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects may present with equivalent neuropathological burdens but have significantly different antemortem cognitive decline rates. Using the transcriptome as a proxy for functional state, we selected 414 expression profiles of symptomatic AD subjects and age-matched non-demented controls from a community-based neuropathological study. By combining brain tissue-specific protein interactomes with gene networks, we identified functionally distinct composite clusters of genes that reveal extensive changes in expression levels in AD. Global expression for clusters broadly corresponding to synaptic transmission, metabolism, cell cycle, survival, and immune response were downregulated, while the upregulated cluster included largely uncharacterized processes. We propose that loss of EGR3 regulation mediates synaptic deficits by targeting the synaptic vesicle cycle. Our results highlight the utility of integrating protein interactions with gene perturbations to generate a comprehensive framework for characterizing alterations in the molecular network as applied to AD.

Abstract: Cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) signalling affects several cellular processes in Bacillus cereus group bacteria including biofilm formation and motility, and CdgF was previously identified as a diguanylate cyclase promoting biofilm formation in B. thuringiensis. C-di-GMP can exert its function as a second messenger via riboswitch binding, and a functional c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitch has been found upstream of cbpA in various B. cereus group strains. Protein signature recognition predicted CbpA to be a cell wall-anchored surface protein with a fibrinogen or collagen binding domain. The aim of this study was to identify the binding ligand of CbpA and the function of CbpA in cellular processes that are part of the B. cereus group c-di-GMP regulatory network. By global gene expression profiling cbpA was found to be down-regulated in a cdgF deletion mutant, and cbpA exhibited maximum expression in early exponential growth. Contrary to the wild type, a ΔcbpA deletion mutant showed no binding to collagen in a cell adhesion assay, while a CbpA overexpression strain exhibited slightly increased collagen binding compared to the control. For both fibrinogen and fibronectin there was however no change in binding activity compared to controls, and CbpA did not appear to contribute to binding to abiotic surfaces (polystyrene, glass, steel). Also, the CbpA overexpression strain appeared to be less motile and showed a decrease in biofilm formation compared to the control. This study provides the first experimental proof that the binding ligand of the c-di-GMP regulated adhesin CbpA is collagen.

Abstract: Summary
Every bacterial population harbors a small subpopulation of so-called persisters that are transiently antibiotic tolerant. These persisters are associated with the recalcitrance of chronic infections because they can recolonize the host after antibiotic removal. Although several effectors have been described to induce persistence, persister cell awakening is poorly understood. We previously reported that the toxin HokB induces persistence via pore formation, resulting in membrane depolarization and ATP leakage. We now delineate mechanisms responsible for the awakening of HokB-induced persisters. We show that HokB dimerization by the oxidoreductase DsbA is essential for pore formation and peptide stability. Pores are disassembled via DsbC-mediated monomerization, which targets HokB for DegQ-mediated degradation. Finally, pore disassembly allows membrane repolarization by the electron transport chain, supporting cells to resume growth. These results provide a detailed view of both the formation and awakening of HokB-induced persister cells.

Abstract: Summary
Stroke causes focal brain lesions that disrupt functional connectivity (FC), a measure of activity synchronization, throughout distributed brain networks. It is often assumed that FC disruptions reflect damage to specific cortical regions. However, an alternative explanation is that they reflect the structural disconnection (SDC) of white matter pathways. Here, we compare these explanations using data from 114 stroke patients. Across multiple analyses, we find that SDC measures outperform focal damage measures, including damage to putative critical cortical regions, for explaining FC disruptions associated with stroke. We also identify a core mode of structure-function covariation that links the severity of interhemispheric SDCs to widespread FC disruptions across patients and that correlates with deficits in multiple behavioral domains. We conclude that a lesion’s impact on the structural connectome is what determines its impact on FC and that interhemispheric SDCs may play a particularly important role in mediating FC disruptions after stroke.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in DNA sequencing technologies have reshaped our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer, providing a precise genomic view of tumors. Complementary biochemical and biophysical perspectives of cancer point toward profound shifts in nutrient uptake and utilization that propel tumor growth and major changes in the structure of the plasma membrane of tumor cells. The molecular mechanisms that bridge these fundamental aspects of tumor biology remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase LPCAT1 functionally links specific genetic alterations in cancer with aberrant metabolism and plasma membrane remodeling to drive tumor growth. Growth factor receptor-driven cancers are found to depend on LPCAT1 to shape plasma membrane composition through enhanced saturated phosphatidylcholine content that is, in turn, required for the transduction of oncogenic signals. These results point to a genotype-informed strategy that prioritizes lipid remodeling pathways as therapeutic targets for diverse cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Methods for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have greatly advanced in recent years. While droplet- and well-based methods have increased the capture frequency of cells for scRNA-seq, these technologies readily produce technical artifacts, such as doublet cell captures. Doublets occurring between distinct cell types can appear as hybrid scRNA-seq profiles, but do not have distinct transcriptomes from individual cell states. We introduce DoubletDecon, an approach that detects doublets with a combination of deconvolution analyses and the identification of unique cell-state gene expression. We demonstrate the ability of DoubletDecon to identify synthetic, mixed-species, genetic, and cell-hashing cell doublets from scRNA-seq datasets of varying cellular complexity with a high sensitivity relative to alternative approaches. Importantly, this algorithm prevents the prediction of valid mixed-lineage and transitional cell states as doublets by considering their unique gene expression. DoubletDecon has an easy-to-use graphical user interface and is compatible with diverse species and unsupervised population detection algorithms.

Abstract: Summary
During heart regeneration in the zebrafish, fibrotic tissue is replaced by newly formed cardiomyocytes derived from preexisting ones. It is unclear whether the heart is composed of several cardiomyocyte populations bearing different capacity to replace lost myocardium. Here, using sox10 genetic fate mapping, we identify a subset of preexistent cardiomyocytes in the adult zebrafish heart with a distinct gene expression profile that expanded after cryoinjury. Genetic ablation of sox10+ cardiomyocytes impairs cardiac regeneration, revealing that these cells play a role in heart regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotes with multiple small RNA pathways, the mechanisms that channel RNAs within specific pathways are unclear. Here, we reveal the reactions that account for channeling in the small interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis phase of the Arabidopsis RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. The process begins with template DNA transcription by NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE IV (Pol IV), whose atypical termination mechanism, induced by nontemplate DNA base-pairing, channels transcripts to the associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RDR2. RDR2 converts Pol IV transcripts into double-stranded RNAs and then typically adds an extra untemplated 3′ terminal nucleotide to the second strands. The dicer endonuclease DCL3 cuts resulting duplexes to generate 24- and 23-nt siRNAs. The 23-nt RNAs bear the untemplated terminal nucleotide of the RDR2 strand and are underrepresented among ARGONAUTE4-associated siRNAs. Collectively, our results provide mechanistic insights into Pol IV termination, Pol IV-RDR2 coupling, and RNA channeling, from template DNA transcription to siRNA strand discrimination.

Abstract: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) of bacterial adaptive immunity have been adopted as a powerful and versatile tool for manipulation of the genome. This paradigm has been widely applied in biological research and treatments of animal or cellular disease models. A critical feature of CRISPR-Cas is the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), which dictates the DNA target recognition mechanism of Cas proteins. While, direct identifying functional PAM sequences in human cells remains a challenge. Here, we developed a positive screen system termed PAM-DOSE (PAM Definition by Observable Sequence Excision) to delineate the functional PAMs in human cells. Specifically, the PAM libraries for CRISPR-Cas (SpCas9, SpCas9-NG, FnCas12a, AsCas12a, LbCas12a and MbCas12a) were generated and the corresponding CRISPR-Cas mediated cleaved fragments with functional PAM in human cells were harvested for DNA sequencing, which could be tracked and visualized with either florescence microscopy or flow cytometry analysis. With this system, we identified the functional PAMs of CRISPR-Cas members. We also found that spacer sequence affects the PAM preference of Cas proteins. This method will facilitate identification of functional PAMs for Cas-mediated human genome editing applications.

Abstract: Summary
The success of immunotherapy has led to a myriad of clinical trials accompanied by efforts to gain mechanistic insight and identify predictive signatures for personalization. However, many immune monitoring technologies face investigator bias, missing unanticipated cellular responses in limited clinical material. We present here a mass cytometry (CyTOF) workflow for standardized, systems-level biomarker discovery in immunotherapy trials. To broadly enumerate immune cell identity and activity, we established and extensively assessed a reference panel of 33 antibodies to cover major cell subsets, simultaneously quantifying activation and immune checkpoint molecules in a single assay. This assay enumerates ≥98% of peripheral immune cells with ≥4 positively identifying antigens. Robustness and reproducibility are demonstrated on multiple samples types, across two research centers and by orthogonal measurements. Using automated analysis, we identify stratifying immune signatures in bone marrow transplantation-associated graft-versus-host disease. Together, this validated workflow ensures comprehensive immunophenotypic analysis and data comparability and will accelerate biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptive type 2 immune responses against the intestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Hp) require the interaction of follicle-associated CXCR5+ dendritic cells with naive T cells in the draining mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs). However, the source of CXCL13 responsible for attracting CXCR5+ dendritic cells has remained unclear. Using multiplex imaging combined with deep tissue analysis, we observed new CXCL13+ fibroblastic reticular cells surrounding paracortical and cortical B cell follicles in the mLNs of infected mice. CXCL13+ fibroblasts expressed markers of marginal reticular cells (MRCs), and their expansion required lymphotoxin (LT)-dependent interactions between IL-4Rα-expressing B cells and CCL19+ fibroblasts. Infection-induced follicles did not necessarily contain follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), indicating that CXCL13+ fibroblasts may instead drive their formation. These data reveal a role for lymphotoxin signaling to CCL19+ fibroblasts in the development of CXCL13+ MRC-like cells and adaptive type 2 immunity in response to helminth infection.

Abstract: Summary
Rhodopsin (Rho), a prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in vertebrate vision, activates the G-protein transducin (GT) by catalyzing GDP-GTP exchange on its α subunit (GαT). To elucidate the determinants of GT coupling and activation, we obtained cryo-EM structures of a fully functional, light-activated Rho-GT complex in the presence and absence of a G-protein-stabilizing nanobody. The structures illustrate how GT overcomes its low basal activity by engaging activated Rho in a conformation distinct from other GPCR-G-protein complexes. Moreover, the nanobody-free structures reveal native conformations of G-protein components and capture three distinct conformers showing the GαT helical domain (αHD) contacting the Gβγ subunits. These findings uncover the molecular underpinnings of G-protein activation by visual rhodopsin and shed new light on the role played by Gβγ during receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange.

Abstract: Summary
Muscle function is regulated by Ca2+, which mediates excitation-contraction coupling, energy metabolism, adaptation to exercise, and sarcolemmal repair. Several of these actions rely on Ca2+ delivery to the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, the pore of which is formed by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). MCU’s gatekeeping and cooperative activation are controlled by MICU1. Loss-of-protein mutation in MICU1 causes a neuromuscular disease. To determine the mechanisms underlying the muscle impairments, we used MICU1 patient cells and skeletal muscle-specific MICU1 knockout mice. Both these models show a lower threshold for MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake. Lack of MICU1 is associated with impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake during excitation-contraction, aerobic metabolism impairment, muscle weakness, fatigue, and myofiber damage during physical activity. MICU1 deficit compromises mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake during sarcolemmal injury, which causes ineffective repair of the damaged myofibers. Thus, dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake hampers myofiber contractile function, likely through energy metabolism and membrane repair.

Abstract: Summary
SF3B1, which encodes an essential spliceosomal protein, is frequently mutated in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and many cancers. However, the defect of mutant SF3B1 is unknown. Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from MDS patients and confirmed that SF3B1 mutants use aberrant 3′ splice sites. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we purified complexes containing either wild-type or the hotspot K700E mutant SF3B1 and found that levels of a poorly studied spliceosomal protein, SUGP1, were reduced in mutant spliceosomes. Strikingly, SUGP1 knockdown completely recapitulated the splicing errors, whereas SUGP1 overexpression drove the protein, which our data suggest plays an important role in branchsite recognition, into the mutant spliceosome and partially rescued splicing. Other hotspot SF3B1 mutants showed similar altered splicing and diminished interaction with SUGP1. Our study demonstrates that SUGP1 loss is a common defect of spliceosomes with disease-causing SF3B1 mutations and, because this defect can be rescued, suggests possibilities for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Fate-changing transcription factors (TFs) scan chromatin to initiate new genetic programs during cell differentiation and reprogramming. Yet the protein structure domains that allow TFs to target nucleosomal DNA remain unexplored. We screened diverse TFs for binding to nucleosomes containing motif-enriched sequences targeted by pioneer factors in vivo. FOXA1, OCT4, ASCL1/E12α, PU1, CEBPα, and ZELDA display a range of nucleosome binding affinities that correlate with their cell reprogramming potential. We further screened 593 full-length human TFs on protein microarrays against different nucleosome sequences, followed by confirmation in solution, to distinguish among factors that bound nucleosomes, such as the neuronal AP-2α/β/γ, versus factors that only bound free DNA. Structural comparisons of DNA binding domains revealed that efficient nucleosome binders use short anchoring α helices to bind DNA, whereas weak nucleosome binders use unstructured regions and/or β sheets. Thus, specific modes of DNA interaction allow nucleosome scanning that confers pioneer activity to transcription factors.

Abstract: Summary
Defects in mitotic spindle orientation (MSO) disrupt the organization of stem cell niches impacting tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. Mutations in centrosome genes reduce MSO fidelity, leading to tissue dysplasia and causing several diseases such as microcephaly, dwarfism, and cancer. Whether these mutations perturb spindle orientation solely by affecting astral microtubule nucleation or whether centrosome proteins have more direct functions in regulating MSO is unknown. To investigate this question, we analyzed the consequences of deregulating Plk4 (the master centriole duplication kinase) activity in Drosophila asymmetrically dividing neural stem cells. We found that Plk4 functions upstream of MSO control, orchestrating centriole symmetry breaking and consequently centrosome positioning. Mechanistically, we show that Plk4 acts through Spd2 phosphorylation, which induces centriole release from the apical cortex. Overall, this work not only reveals a role for Plk4 in regulating centrosome function but also links the centrosome biogenesis machinery with the MSO apparatus.

Abstract: Summary
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulatory molecules, but unlike with other RNAs, the direct link between their tertiary structure motifs and their function has proven elusive. Here we report structural and functional studies of human maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a tumor suppressor lncRNA that modulates the p53 response. We found that, in an evolutionary conserved region of MEG3, two distal motifs interact by base complementarity to form alternative, mutually exclusive pseudoknot structures (“kissing loops”). Mutations that disrupt these interactions impair MEG3-dependent p53 stimulation in vivo and disrupt MEG3 folding in vitro. These findings provide mechanistic insights into regulation of the p53 pathway by MEG3 and reveal how conserved motifs of tertiary structure can regulate lncRNA biological function.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification occurs co-transcriptionally and impacts pre-mRNA processing; however, the mechanism of co-transcriptional m6A-dependent alternative splicing regulation is still poorly understood. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G (hnRNPG) is an m6A reader protein that binds RNA through RRM and Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) motifs. Here, we show that hnRNPG directly binds to the phosphorylated carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) using RGG motifs in its low-complexity region. Through interactions with the phosphorylated CTD and nascent RNA, hnRNPG associates co-transcriptionally with RNAPII and regulates alternative splicing transcriptome-wide. m6A near splice sites in nascent pre-mRNA modulates hnRNPG binding, which influences RNAPII occupancy patterns and promotes exon inclusion. Our results reveal an integrated mechanism of co-transcriptional m6A-mediated splicing regulation, in which an m6A reader protein uses RGG motifs to co-transcriptionally interact with both RNAPII and m6A-modified nascent pre-mRNA to modulate RNAPII occupancy and alternative splicing.

Abstract: Summary
The fidelity of inhibitory neurotransmission is dependent on the accumulation of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) at the appropriate synaptic sites. Synaptic GABAARs are constructed from α(1-3), β(1-3), and γ2 subunits, and neurons can target these subtypes to specific synapses. Here, we identify a 15-amino acid inhibitory synapse targeting motif (ISTM) within the α2 subunit that promotes the association between GABAARs and the inhibitory scaffold proteins collybistin and gephyrin. Using mice in which the ISTM has been introduced into the α1 subunit (Gabra1-2 mice), we show that the ISTM is critical for axo-axonic synapse formation, the efficacy of GABAergic neurotransmission, and seizure sensitivity. The Gabra1-2 mutation rescues seizure-induced lethality in Gabra2-1 mice, which lack axo-axonic synapses due to the deletion of the ISTM from the α2 subunit. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the ISTM plays a critical role in promoting inhibitory synapse formation, both in the axonic and somatodendritic compartments.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of body temperature critically depends on thyroid hormone (TH). Recent studies revealed that TH induces browning of white adipose tissue, possibly contributing to the observed hyperthermia in hyperthyroid patients and potentially providing metabolic benefits. Here, we show that browning by TH requires TH-receptor β and occurs independently of the sympathetic nervous system. The beige fat, however, lacks sufficient adrenergic stimulation and is not metabolically activated despite high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Studies at different environmental temperatures reveal that TH instead causes hyperthermia by actions in skeletal muscle combined with a central body temperature set-point elevation. Consequently, the metabolic and thermogenic effects of systemic hyperthyroidism were maintained in UCP1 knockout mice, demonstrating that neither beige nor brown fat contributes to the TH-induced hyperthermia and elevated glucose consumption, and underlining that the mere presence of UCP1 is insufficient to draw conclusions on the therapeutic potential of browning agents.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of synchrony between geophysical time and insulin action predisposes to metabolic diseases. Yet the brain and peripheral pathways linking proper insulin effect to diurnal changes in light-dark and feeding-fasting inputs are poorly understood. Here, we show that the insulin sensitivity of several metabolically relevant tissues fluctuates during the 24 h period. For example, in mice, the insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue is lowest during the light period. Mechanistically, by performing loss- and gain-of-light-action and food-restriction experiments, we demonstrate that SIRT1 in steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) convey photic inputs to entrain the biochemical and metabolic action of insulin in skeletal muscle. These findings uncover a critical light-SF1-neuron-skeletal-muscle axis that acts to finely tune diurnal changes in insulin sensitivity and reveal a light regulatory mechanism of skeletal muscle function.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent a major component of the tumor microenvironment supporting tumorigenesis. TAMs re-education has been proposed as a strategy to promote tumor inhibition. However, whether this approach may work in prostate cancer is unknown. Here we find that Pten-null prostate tumors are strongly infiltrated by TAMs expressing C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2), and activation of this receptor through CXCL2 polarizes macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Notably, pharmacological blockade of CXCR2 receptor by a selective antagonist promoted the re-education of TAMs toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Strikingly, CXCR2 knockout monocytes infused in Ptenpc−/−; Trp53pc−/− mice differentiated in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-releasing pro-inflammatory macrophages, leading to senescence and tumor inhibition. Mechanistically, PTEN-deficient tumor cells are vulnerable to TNF-α-induced senescence, because of an increase of TNFR1. Our results identify TAMs as targets in prostate cancer and describe a therapeutic strategy based on CXCR2 blockade to harness anti-tumorigenic potential of macrophages against this disease.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-associated mutations in genes encoding RNA splicing factors (SFs) commonly occur in leukemias, as well as in a variety of solid tumors, and confer dependence on wild-type splicing. These observations have led to clinical efforts to directly inhibit the spliceosome in patients with refractory leukemias. Here, we identify that inhibiting symmetric or asymmetric dimethylation of arginine, mediated by PRMT5 and type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), respectively, reduces splicing fidelity and results in preferential killing of SF-mutant leukemias over wild-type counterparts. These data identify genetic subsets of cancer most likely to respond to PRMT inhibition, synergistic effects of combined PRMT5 and type I PRMT inhibition, and a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic efficacy of PRMT inhibition in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Mucus separates gut-luminal microbes from the tissue. It is unclear how pathogens like Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm) can overcome this obstacle. Using live microscopy, we monitored S.Tm interactions with native murine gut explants and studied how mucus affects the infection. A dense inner mucus layer covers the distal colon tissue, limiting direct tissue access. S.Tm performs near-surface swimming on this mucus layer, which allows probing for colon mucus heterogeneities, but can also entrap the bacterium in the dense inner colon mucus layer. In the cecum, dense mucus fills only the bottom of the intestinal crypts, leaving the epithelium between crypts unshielded and prone to access by motile and non-motile bacteria alike. This explains why the cecum is highly infection permissive and represents the primary site of S.Tm enterocolitis in the streptomycin mouse model. Our findings highlight the importance of mucus in intestinal defense and homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise engages signaling networks to control the release of circulating factors beneficial to health. However, the nature of these networks remains undefined. Using high-throughput phosphoproteomics, we quantify 20,249 phosphorylation sites in skeletal muscle-like myotube cells and monitor their responses to a panel of cell stressors targeting aspects of exercise signaling in vivo. Integrating these in-depth phosphoproteomes with the phosphoproteome of acute aerobic exercise in human skeletal muscle suggests that co-administration of β-adrenergic and calcium agonists would activate complementary signaling relevant to this exercise context. The phosphoproteome of cells treated with this combination reveals a surprising divergence in signaling from the individual treatments. Remarkably, only the combination treatment promotes multisite phosphorylation of SERBP1, a regulator of Serpine1 mRNA stability, a pro-fibrotic secreted protein. Secretome analysis reveals that the combined treatments decrease secretion of SERPINE1 and other deleterious factors. This study provides a framework for dissecting phosphorylation-based signaling relevant to acute exercise.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory functions of the vagus nerve are critical for conscious perceptions and for monitoring visceral functions in the cardio-pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems. Here, we present a comprehensive identification, classification, and validation of the neuron types in the neural crest (jugular) and placode (nodose) derived vagal ganglia by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) transcriptomic analysis. Our results reveal major differences between neurons derived from different embryonic origins. Jugular neurons exhibit fundamental similarities to the somatosensory spinal neurons, including major types, such as C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs), A-LTMRs, Aδ-nociceptors, and cold-, and mechano-heat C-nociceptors. In contrast, the nodose ganglion contains 18 distinct types dedicated to surveying the physiological state of the internal body. Our results reveal a vast diversity of vagal neuron types, including many previously unanticipated types, as well as proposed types that are consistent with chemoreceptors, nutrient detectors, baroreceptors, and stretch and volume mechanoreceptors of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular systems.

Abstract: Summary
Variations in the human FTO gene have been linked to obesity and altered connectivity of the dopaminergic neurocircuitry. Here, we report that fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in dopamine D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2 MSNs) of mice regulate the excitability of these cells and control their striatopallidal globus pallidus external (GPe) projections. Lack of FTO in D2 MSNs translates into increased locomotor activity to novelty, associated with altered timing behavior, without impairing the ability to control actions or affecting reward-driven and conditioned behavior. Pharmacological manipulations of dopamine D1 receptor (D1R)- or D2R-dependent pathways in these animals reveal altered responses to D1- and D2-MSN-mediated control of motor output. These findings reveal a critical role for FTO to control D2 MSN excitability, their projections to the GPe, and behavioral responses to novelty.

Abstract: Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) are pacemaker cells that exhibit periodic spontaneous depolarization in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and generate pacemaker potentials. In this study, we investigated the effects of ghrelin and motilin on the pacemaker potentials of ICCs isolated from the mouse small intestine. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration, we demonstrated that ghrelin depolarized pacemaker potentials of cultured ICCs in a dose-dependent manner. The ghrelin receptor antagonist [D-Lys] GHRP-6 completely inhibited this ghrelin-induced depolarization. Intracellular guanosine 5′-diphosphate-β-S and pre-treatment with Ca2+-free solution or thapsigargin also blocked the ghrelin-induced depolarization. To investigate the involvement of inositol triphosphate (IP3), Rho kinase, and protein kinase C (PKC) in ghrelin-mediated pacemaker potential depolarization of ICCs, we used the IP3 receptor inhibitors 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and xestospongin C, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, and the PKC inhibitors staurosporine, Go6976, and rottlerin. All inhibitors except rottlerin blocked the ghrelin-induced pacemaker potential depolarization of ICCs. In addition, motilin depolarized the pacemaker potentials of ICCs in a similar dose-dependent manner as ghrelin, and this was also completely inhibited by [D-Lys] GHRP-6. These results suggest that ghrelin induced the pacemaker potential depolarization through the ghrelin receptor in a G protein-, IP3-, Rho kinase-, and PKC-dependent manner via intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ regulation. In addition, motilin was able to depolarize the pacemaker potentials of ICCs through the ghrelin receptor. Therefore, ghrelin and its receptor may modulate GI motility by acting on ICCs in the murine small intestine.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer metastasis depends on cell survival following loss of extracellular matrix attachment and dissemination through the circulation. The metastatic spread can be enhanced by the clustering of detached cancer cells and increased antioxidant defense. Here, we link these responses by describing how cell clustering limits reactive oxygen species (ROS). Loss of attachment causes mitochondrial perturbations and increased ROS production. The formation of cell clusters induces a hypoxic environment that drives hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (Hif1α)-mediated mitophagy, clearing damaged mitochondria and limiting ROS. However, hypoxia and reduced mitochondrial capacity promote dependence on glycolysis for ATP production that is supported by cytosolic reductive metabolism. Preventing this metabolic adaptation or disruption of cell clusters results in ROS accumulation, cell death, and a reduction of metastatic capacity in vivo. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of cell clustering in supporting survival during extracellular matrix detachment and metastatic spread and may point to targetable vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrosis is the final common pathway leading to end-stage renal failure. By analyzing the kidneys of patients and animal models with fibrosis, we observed a significant mitochondrial defect, including the loss of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) in kidney tubule cells. Here, we generated mice with tubule-specific deletion of TFAM (Ksp-Cre/Tfamflox/flox). While these mice developed severe mitochondrial loss and energetic deficit by 6 weeks of age, kidney fibrosis, immune cell infiltration, and progressive azotemia causing death were only observed around 12 weeks of age. In renal cells of TFAM KO (knockout) mice, aberrant packaging of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) resulted in its cytosolic translocation, activation of the cytosolic cGAS-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) DNA sensing pathway, and thus cytokine expression and immune cell recruitment. Ablation of STING ameliorated kidney fibrosis in mouse models of chronic kidney disease, demonstrating how TFAM sequesters mtDNA to limit the inflammation leading to fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
In the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA), CD4+ T cells promote pro-inflammatory effector functions by shunting glucose away from glycolysis and ATP production. Underlying mechanisms remain unknown, and here we implicate the DNA repair nuclease MRE11A in the cells’ bioenergetic failure. MRE11A deficiency in RA T cells disrupted mitochondrial oxygen consumption and suppressed ATP generation. Also, MRE11A loss of function caused leakage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol, triggering inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and pyroptotic cell death. Caspase-1 activation was frequent in lymph-node-residing T cells in RA patients. In vivo, pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of MRE11A resulted in tissue deposition of mtDNA, caspase-1 proteolysis, and aggressive tissue inflammation. Conversely, MRE11A overexpression restored mitochondrial fitness and shielded tissue from inflammatory attack. Thus, the nuclease MRE11A regulates a mitochondrial protection program, and MRE11A deficiency leads to DNA repair defects, energy production, and failure and loss of tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
In complex genetic loci, individual enhancers interact most often with specific basal promoters. Here we investigate the activation of the Bicoid target gene hunchback (hb), which contains two basal promoters (P1 and P2). Early in embryogenesis, P1 is silent, while P2 is strongly activated. In vivo deletion of P2 does not cause activation of P1, suggesting that P2 contains intrinsic sequence motifs required for activation. We show that a two-motif code (a Zelda binding site plus TATA) is required and sufficient for P2 activation. Zelda sites are present in the promoters of many embryonically expressed genes, but the combination of Zelda plus TATA does not seem to be a general code for early activation or Bicoid-specific activation per se. Because Zelda sites are also found in Bicoid-dependent enhancers, we propose that simultaneous binding to both enhancers and promoters independently synchronizes chromatin accessibility and facilitates correct enhancer-promoter interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Extra-cranial malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) and cranial atypical teratoid RTs (ATRTs) are heterogeneous pediatric cancers driven primarily by SMARCB1 loss. To understand the genome-wide molecular relationships between MRTs and ATRTs, we analyze multi-omics data from 140 MRTs and 161 ATRTs. We detect similarities between the MYC subgroup of ATRTs (ATRT-MYC) and extra-cranial MRTs, including global DNA hypomethylation and overexpression of HOX genes and genes involved in mesenchymal development, distinguishing them from other ATRT subgroups that express neural-like features. We identify five DNA methylation subgroups associated with anatomical sites and SMARCB1 mutation patterns. Groups 1, 3, and 4 exhibit cytotoxic T cell infiltration and expression of immune checkpoint regulators, consistent with a potential role for immunotherapy in rhabdoid tumor patients.

Abstract: Summary
YAP/TEAD are nuclear effectors of the Hippo pathway, regulating organ size and tumorigenesis largely through promoter-associated function. However, their function as enhancer regulators remains poorly understood. Through an in vivo proximity-dependent labeling (BioID) technique, we identified YAP1 and TEAD4 protein as co-regulators of ERα on enhancers. The binding of YAP1/TEAD4 to ERα-bound enhancers is augmented upon E2 stimulation and is required for the induction of E2/ERα target genes and E2-induced oncogenic cell growth. Furthermore, their enhancer binding is a prerequisite for enhancer activation marked by eRNA transcription and for the recruitment of the enhancer activation machinery component MED1. The binding of TEAD4 on active ERE-containing enhancers is independent of its DNA-binding behavior, and instead, occurs through protein-tethering trans-binding. Our data reveal a non-canonical function of YAP1 and TEAD4 as ERα cofactors in regulating cancer growth, highlighting the potential of YAP/TEAD as possible actionable drug targets for ERα+ breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells acquire unlimited proliferative capacity by either re-expressing telomerase or inducing alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), which relies on telomere recombination. Here, we show that ALT recombination requires coordinate regulation of the SMX and BTR complexes to ensure the appropriate balance of resolution and dissolution activities at recombining telomeres. Critical to this control is SLX4IP, which accumulates at ALT telomeres and interacts with SLX4, XPF, and BLM. Loss of SLX4IP increases ALT-related phenotypes, which is incompatible with cell growth following concomitant loss of SLX4. Inactivation of BLM is sufficient to rescue telomere aggregation and the synthetic growth defect in this context, suggesting that SLX4IP favors SMX-dependent resolution by antagonizing promiscuous BLM activity during ALT recombination. Finally, we show that SLX4IP is inactivated in a subset of ALT-positive osteosarcomas. Collectively, our findings uncover an SLX4IP-dependent regulatory mechanism critical for telomere maintenance in ALT cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Growth factor signaling is initiated at the plasma membrane and propagated through the cytoplasm for eventual relay to intracellular organelles such as lysosomes. The serine/threonine kinase mTOR participates in growth factor signaling as a component of two multi-subunit complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 associates with lysosomes, and its activity depends on the positioning of lysosomes within the cytoplasm, although there is no consensus regarding the exact effect of perinuclear versus peripheral distribution. mTORC2 and its substrate kinase AKT have a widespread distribution, but they are thought to act mainly at the plasma membrane. Using cell lines with knockout of components of the lysosome-positioning machinery, we show that perinuclear clustering of lysosomes delays reactivation of not only mTORC1, but also mTORC2 and AKT upon serum replenishment. These experiments demonstrate the existence of pools of mTORC2 and AKT that are sensitive to lysosome positioning.

Abstract: Summary
Following infection, inflammatory cues upregulate core transcriptional programs to establish pathogen-specific protection. In viral infections, T follicular helper (TFH) cells express the prototypical T helper 1 transcription factor T-bet. Several studies have demonstrated essential but conflicting roles for T-bet in TFH biology. Understanding the basis of this controversy is crucial, as modulation of T-bet expression instructs TFH differentiation and ultimately protective antibody responses. Comparing influenza and LCMV viral infections, we demonstrate that the role of T-bet is contingent on the environmental setting of TFH differentiation, IL-2 signaling, and T cell competition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that T-bet expression by either TFH or GC B cells independently drives antibody isotype class switching. Specifically, T cell-specific loss of T-bet promotes IgG1, whereas B cell-specific loss of T-bet inhibits IgG2a/c switching. Combined, this work highlights that the context-dependent induction of T-bet instructs the development of protective, neutralizing antibodies following viral infection or vaccination.

Abstract: Summary
The excitability of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells is mediated by a slow AHP (sAHP) that responds to calcium increases by Cav1 calcium channels and ryanodine receptors (RyR). We used super-resolution and FRET microscopy to investigate the proximity and functional coupling among Cav1.3/Cav1.2, RyR2, and KCa3.1 potassium channels that contribute to the sAHP. dSTORM and FRET imaging shows that Cav1.3, RyR2, and KCa3.1 are organized as a triprotein complex that colocalizes with junctophilin (JPH) 3 and 4 proteins that tether the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum. JPH3 and JPH4 shRNAs dissociated a Cav1.3-RyR2-KCa3.1 complex and reduced the IsAHP. Infusing JPH3 and JPH4 antibodies into CA1 cells reduced IsAHP and spike accommodation. These data indicate that JPH3 and JPH4 proteins maintain a Cav1-RyR2-KCa3.1 complex that allows two calcium sources to act in tandem to define the activation properties of KCa3.1 channels and the IsAHP.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferons (IFNs) have therapeutic potential in CNS autoimmune diseases, such as uveitis, but the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using a T cell-transfer model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), we found that IFN-α/β treatment inhibited the migration of IFN-γ-producing pathogenic CD4+ T cells to effector sites. IFN-α/β upregulated the expression of the cognate ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, causing ligand-mediated downregulation of CXCR3 expression and effector T cell retention in the spleen. Accordingly, type I IFN did not alter EAU progression in CXCR3−/− mice. In uveitis patients, disease exacerbations correlated with reduced serum IFN-α concentrations. IFN-α/β reduced CXCR3 expression and migration by human effector T cells, and these parameters were associated with the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-α in uveitis patients. Our findings provide insight into the molecular basis of type I IFN therapy for CNS autoimmune diseases and identify CXCR3 as a biomarker for effective type I IFN immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Acute itch can be generated by either chemical or mechanical stimuli, which activate separate pathways in the periphery and spinal cord. While substantial progress has been made in mapping the transmission pathway for chemical itch, the central pathway for mechanical itch remains obscure. Using complementary genetic and pharmacological manipulations, we show that excitatory neurons marked by the expression of the neuropeptide Y1 receptor (Y1Cre neurons) form an essential pathway in the dorsal spinal cord for the transmission of mechanical but not chemical itch. Ablating or silencing the Y1Cre neurons abrogates mechanical itch, while chemogenetic activation induces scratching. Moreover, using Y1 conditional knockout mice, we demonstrate that endogenous neuropeptide Y (NPY) acts via dorsal-horn Y1-expressing neurons to suppress light punctate touch and mechanical itch stimuli. NPY-Y1 signaling thus regulates the transmission of innocuous tactile information by establishing biologically relevant thresholds for touch discrimination and mechanical itch reflexes.

Abstract: Summary
Histone methylation is essential for regulating gene expression during organogenesis to maintain stem cells and execute a proper differentiation program for their descendants. Here we show that the COMPASS family histone methyltransferase co-factor ASH2L is required for maintaining neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and the production and positioning of projection neurons during neocortex development. Specifically, loss of Ash2l in NPCs results in malformation of the neocortex; the mutant neocortex has fewer neurons, which are also abnormal in composition and laminar position. Moreover, ASH2L loss impairs trimethylation of H3K4 and the transcriptional machinery specific for Wnt-β-catenin signaling, inhibiting the proliferation ability of NPCs at late stages of neurogenesis by disrupting S phase entry to inhibit cell cycle progression. Overexpressing β-catenin after ASH2L elimination rescues the proliferation deficiency. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that ASH2L is crucial for modulating Wnt signaling to maintain NPCs and generate a full complement of neurons during mammalian neocortex development.

Abstract: Summary
γ-interferon-inducible protein-16 (IFI16), a key DNA sensor, triggers downstream STING-dependent type I interferon (IFN-I) production and antiviral immunity. However, it is still unclear how to negatively regulate IFI16 to avoid excessive IFN-I production and autoimmunity. Here, we find that STING directly interacts with IFI16 and facilitates IFI16 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by recruiting the E3 ligase TRIM21. The 1-pyrin region of IFI16 is responsible for the IFI16-STING interaction, and the first three lysines in the N-terminal region of IFI16 are the key sites that lead to STING-mediated IFI16 ubiquitination and degradation. Compared to wild-type IFI16, a higher level of viral DNA triggered IFN-β and antiviral IFN-stimulated gene expression, and thus less HSV-1 infection, was observed in the cells transfected with IFI16-K3/4/6R, an IFI16 mutant that is resistant to degradation. STING-mediated negative feedback regulation of IFI16 restricts IFN-I overproduction during antiviral immunity to avoid autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms that enable immune evasion at metastatic sites are poorly understood. We show that the Polycomb Repressor Complex 1 (PRC1) drives colonization of the bones and visceral organs in double-negative prostate cancer (DNPC). In vivo genetic screening identifies CCL2 as the top prometastatic gene induced by PRC1. CCL2 governs self-renewal and induces the recruitment of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages and regulatory T cells, thus coordinating metastasis initiation with immune suppression and neoangiogenesis. A catalytic inhibitor of PRC1 cooperates with immune checkpoint therapy to reverse these processes and suppress metastasis in genetically engineered mouse transplantation models of DNPC. These results reveal that PRC1 coordinates stemness with immune evasion and neoangiogenesis and point to the potential clinical utility of targeting PRC1 in DNPC.

Abstract: Summary
Malaria represents a major global health issue, and the identification of new intervention targets remains an urgent priority. This search is hampered by more than one-third of the genes of malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites being uncharacterized. We report a large-scale protein interaction network in Plasmodium schizonts, generated by combining blue native-polyacrylamide electrophoresis with quantitative mass spectrometry and machine learning. This integrative approach, spanning 3 species, identifies >20,000 putative protein interactions, organized into 600 protein clusters. We validate selected interactions, assigning functions in chromatin regulation to previously unannotated proteins and suggesting a role for an EELM2 domain-containing protein and a putative microrchidia protein as mechanistic links between AP2-domain transcription factors and epigenetic regulation. Our interactome represents a high-confidence map of the native organization of core cellular processes in Plasmodium parasites. The network reveals putative functions for uncharacterized proteins, provides mechanistic and structural insight, and uncovers potential alternative therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
During symmetry breaking, the highly conserved Rho GTPase Cdc42 becomes stabilized at a defined site via an amplification process. However, little is known about how a new polarity site is established in an already asymmetric cell—a critical process in a changing environment. The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans switches from budding to filamentous growth in response to external cues, a transition controlled by Cdc42. Here, we have used optogenetic manipulation of cell polarity to reset growth in asymmetric filamentous C. albicans cells. We show that increasing the level of active Cdc42 on the plasma membrane results in disruption of the exocyst subunit Sec3 localization and a striking de novo clustering of secretory vesicles. This new cluster of secretory vesicles is highly dynamic, moving by hops and jumps, until a new growth site is established. Our results reveal that secretory vesicle clustering can occur in the absence of directional growth.

Abstract: Summary
The Alzheimer’s disease (AD) susceptibility gene, CD2-associated protein (CD2AP), encodes an actin binding adaptor protein, but its function in the nervous system is largely unknown. Loss of the Drosophila ortholog cindr enhances neurotoxicity of human Tau, which forms neurofibrillary tangle pathology in AD. We show that Cindr is expressed in neurons and present at synaptic terminals. cindr mutants show impairments in synapse maturation and both synaptic vesicle recycling and release. Cindr associates and genetically interacts with 14-3-3ζ, regulates the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and affects turnover of Synapsin and the plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA). Loss of cindr elevates PMCA levels and reduces cytosolic calcium. Studies of Cd2ap null mice support a conserved role in synaptic proteostasis, and CD2AP protein levels are inversely related to Synapsin abundance in human postmortem brains. Our results reveal CD2AP neuronal requirements with relevance to AD susceptibility, including for proteostasis, calcium handling, and synaptic structure and function.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence that some high-impact biomedical results cannot be repeated has stimulated interest in practices that generate findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data. Multiple papers have identified specific examples of irreproducibility, but practical ways to make data more reproducible have not been widely studied. Here, five research centers in the NIH LINCS Program Consortium investigate the reproducibility of a prototypical perturbational assay: quantifying the responsiveness of cultured cells to anti-cancer drugs. Such assays are important for drug development, studying cellular networks, and patient stratification. While many experimental and computational factors impact intra- and inter-center reproducibility, the factors most difficult to identify and control are those with a strong dependency on biological context. These factors often vary in magnitude with the drug being analyzed and with growth conditions. We provide ways to identify such context-sensitive factors, thereby improving both the theory and practice of reproducible cell-based assays.

Abstract: Summary
Tetraspanins are a class of evolutionarily conserved transmembrane proteins with 33 members identified in mammals that have the ability to organize specific membrane domains, named tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs). Despite the relative abundance of different tetraspanins in the CNS, few studies have explored their role at synapses. Here, we investigate the function of TSPAN5, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily for which mRNA transcripts are found at high levels in the mouse brain. We demonstrate that TSPAN5 is localized in dendritic spines of pyramidal excitatory neurons and that TSPAN5 knockdown induces a dramatic decrease in spine number because of defects in the spine maturation process. Moreover, we show that TSPAN5 interacts with the postsynaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-1, promoting its correct surface clustering. We propose that membrane compartmentalization by tetraspanins represents an additional mechanism for regulating excitatory synapses.

Abstract: Summary
Cytotoxic lymphocytes normally kill virus-infected cells by apoptosis induction. Cytotoxic granule-dependent apoptosis induction engages the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, whereas death receptor (DR)-dependent apoptosis triggers the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Hantaviruses, single-stranded RNA viruses of the order Bunyavirales, induce strong cytotoxic lymphocyte responses in infected humans. Cytotoxic lymphocytes, however, are largely incapable of eradicating hantavirus-infected cells. Here, we show that the prototypic hantavirus, Hantaan virus (HTNV), induces TRAIL production but strongly inhibits TRAIL-mediated extrinsic apoptosis induction in infected cells by downregulating DR5 cell surface expression. Mechanistic analyses revealed that HTNV triggers both 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of DR5 through direct ubiquitination of DR5 and hampers DR5 transport to the cell surface. These results corroborate earlier findings, demonstrating that hantavirus also inhibits cytotoxic cell granule-dependent apoptosis induction. Together, these findings show that HTNV counteracts intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis induction pathways, providing a defense mechanism utilized by hantaviruses to inhibit cytotoxic cell-mediated eradication of infected cells.

Abstract: Summary
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest superfamily of cell surface signaling proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their cell surface delivery after synthesis remain poorly understood. Here, we screen the TBC domain-containing proteins, putative Rab GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), in the intracellular trafficking of GPCRs and identify several TBC proteins that activity-dependently regulate the anterograde transport, en route from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi or from the Golgi to the cell surface, of several prototypic GPCR members without affecting other plasma membrane proteins. We also show that TBC1D6 functions as a GAP for Rab26, physically associates with Rab26, and attenuates Rab26 interaction with GPCRs. Furthermore, both overexpression and depletion of TBC1D6 inhibit the post-Golgi traffic of GPCRs. These data demonstrate important roles of the TBC proteins in forward trafficking of nascent GPCRs and reveal regulatory mechanisms of GPCR targeting to the functional destination.

Abstract: Summary
Precise control of developmental processes is encoded in the genome in the form of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Such multi-factorial systems are difficult to decode in vertebrates owing to their complex gene hierarchies and dynamic molecular interactions. Here we present a genome-wide in vivo reconstruction of the GRN underlying development of the multipotent neural crest (NC) embryonic cell population. By coupling NC-specific epigenomic and transcriptional profiling at population and single-cell levels with genome/epigenome engineering in vivo, we identify multiple regulatory layers governing NC ontogeny, including NC-specific enhancers and super-enhancers, novel trans-factors, and cis-signatures allowing reverse engineering of the NC-GRN at unprecedented resolution. Furthermore, identification and dissection of divergent upstream combinatorial regulatory codes has afforded new insights into opposing gene circuits that define canonical and neural NC fates early during NC ontogeny. Our integrated approach, allowing dissection of cell-type-specific regulatory circuits in vivo, has broad implications for GRN discovery and investigation.

Abstract: Summary
Drug resistance is a significant hindrance to effective cancer treatment. Although resistance mechanisms of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant cancer cells to lethal EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) treatment have been investigated intensively, how cancer cells orchestrate adaptive response under sublethal drug challenge remains largely unknown. Here, we find that 2-h sublethal TKI treatment elicits a transient drug-tolerant state in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. Continuous sublethal treatment reinforces this tolerance and eventually establishes long-term TKI resistance. This adaptive process involves H3K9 demethylation-mediated upregulation of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1) and subsequent metabolic reprogramming, which promotes TKI resistance through attenuating reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Combination treatment with TKI- and ROS-inducing reagents overcomes this drug resistance in preclinical mouse models. Clinical information analyses support the correlation of BCAT1 expression with the EGFR TKI response. Our findings reveal the importance of BCAT1-engaged metabolism reprogramming in TKI resistance in lung cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is associated with loss of tissue mass and a decline in adult stem cell function in many tissues. In contrast, aging in the prostate is associated with growth-related diseases including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Surprisingly, the effects of aging on prostate epithelial cells have not been established. Here we find that organoid-forming progenitor activity of mouse prostate basal and luminal cells is maintained with age. This is caused by an age-related expansion of progenitor-like luminal cells that share features with human prostate luminal progenitor cells. The increase in luminal progenitor cells may contribute to greater risk for growth-related disease in the aging prostate. Importantly, we demonstrate expansion of human luminal progenitor cells in BPH. In summary, we define a Trop2+ luminal progenitor subset and identify an age-related shift in the luminal compartment of the mouse and human prostate epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activate innate immunity via interactions between their Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domain and downstream adaptor proteins. Here we report that Salmonella Enteritidis produces a secreted protein (TcpS) that contains both a TIR domain and a coiled-coil domain. TcpS blocks MyD88- and TRIF-mediated TLR signaling, inhibits inflammatory responses, and promotes bacterial survival. Early-stage immune evasion by TcpS results in severe tissue damage in the late stage of infection and contributes to Salmonella virulence. TcpS-derived peptides inhibit nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and reduce lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-elicited systemic inflammation. Therapeutic peptide administration alleviates weight loss of mice infected with H1N1 influenza. Importantly, maximal TcpS-mediated TLR inhibition requires the critical TIR-TcpS residues Y191 and I284, as well as TcpS homodimerization via its N-terminal coiled-coil domain. Our study unveils a mechanism in which TcpS suppresses innate immunity via both its homodimerization and interaction with MyD88. TcpS is also a potential therapeutic agent for inflammation-associated diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The release of acetylcholine from cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) directly modulates striatal output via muscarinic receptors on medium spiny neurons (MSNs). While thalamic inputs provide strong excitatory input to ChIs, cortical inputs primarily regulate MSN firing. Here, we found that, while thalamic inputs do drive ChI firing, a subset of ChIs responds robustly to stimulation of cortical inputs as well. To examine how input-evoked changes in ChI firing patterns drive acetylcholine release at cholinergic synapses onto MSNs, muscarinic M4-receptor-mediated synaptic events were measured in MSNs overexpressing G-protein gated potassium channels (GIRK2). Stimulation of both cortical and thalamic inputs was sufficient to equally drive muscarinic synaptic events in MSNs, resulting from the broad synaptic innervation of the stimulus-activated ChI population across many MSNs. Taken together, this indicates an underappreciated role for the extensive cholinergic network, in which small populations of ChIs can drive substantial changes in post-synaptic receptor activity across the striatum.

Abstract: Summary
Iron is an essential metal that fine-tunes the innate immune response by regulating macrophage function, but an integrative view of transcriptional and metabolic responses to iron perturbation in macrophages is lacking. Here, we induced acute iron chelation in primary human macrophages and measured their transcriptional and metabolic responses. Acute iron deprivation causes an anti-proliferative Warburg transcriptome, characterized by an ATF4-dependent signature. Iron-deprived human macrophages show an inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and a concomitant increase in glycolysis, a large increase in glucose-derived citrate pools associated with lipid droplet accumulation, and modest levels of itaconate production. LPS polarization increases the itaconate:succinate ratio and decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In rats, acute iron deprivation reduces the severity of macrophage-dependent crescentic glomerulonephritis by limiting glomerular cell proliferation and inducing lipid accumulation in the renal cortex. These results suggest that acute iron deprivation has in vivo protective effects mediated by an anti-inflammatory immunometabolic switch in macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue browning and systemic energy expenditure provide a defense mechanism against obesity and associated metabolic diseases. In high-cholesterol Western diet-fed mice, mast cell (MC) inactivation ameliorates obesity and insulin resistance and improves the metabolic rate, but a direct role of adipose tissue MCs in thermogenesis and browning remains unproven. Here, we report that adrenoceptor agonist norepinephrine-stimulated metabolic rate and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) browning are enhanced in MC-deficient Kitw-sh/w-sh mice and MC-stabilized wild-type mice on a chow diet. MC reconstitution to SAT in Kitw-sh/w-sh mice blocks these changes. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that MC inactivation elevates SAT platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRα+) adipocyte precursor proliferation and accelerates beige adipocyte differentiation. Using the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) inhibitor and TPH1-deficient MCs, we show that MC-derived serotonin inhibits SAT browning and systemic energy expenditure. Functional inactivation of MCs or inhibition of MC serotonin synthesis in SAT promotes adipocyte browning and systemic energy metabolism in mice.

Abstract: Summary
In the Drosophila ovarian germline, Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signals released by niche cells promote germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance. Although BMP signaling is known to repress expression of a key differentiation factor, it remains unclear whether BMP-responsive transcription also contributes positively to GSC identity. Here, we identify the GSC transcriptome using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), including the BMP-induced transcriptional network. Based on these data, we provide evidence that GSCs form two types of cellular projections. Genetic manipulation and live ex vivo imaging reveal that both classes of projection allow GSCs to access a reservoir of Dpp held away from the GSC-niche interface. Moreover, microtubule-rich projections, termed “cytocensors”, form downstream of BMP and have additional functionality, which is to attenuate BMP signaling. In this way, cytocensors allow dynamic modulation of signal transduction to facilitate differentiation following GSC division. This ability of cytocensors to attenuate the signaling response expands the repertoire of functions associated with signaling projections.

Abstract: Summary
The homeodomain is found in hundreds of transcription factors that play roles in fate determination via cell-autonomous regulation of gene expression. However, some homeodomain-containing proteins (HPs) are thought to be secreted and penetrate neighboring cells to affect the recipient cell fate. To determine whether this is a general characteristic of HPs, we carried out a large-scale validation for intercellular transfer of HPs. Our screening reveals that intercellular transfer is a general feature of HPs, but it occurs in a cell-context-sensitive manner. We also found the secretion is not solely a function of the homeodomain, but it is supported by external motifs containing hydrophobic residues. Thus, mutations of hydrophobic residues of HPs abrogate secretion and consequently interfere with HP function in recipient cells. Collectively, our study proposes that HP transfer is an intercellular communication method that couples the functions of interacting cells.

Abstract: Summary
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading heritable cause of intellectual disability and commonly co-occurs with autism spectrum disorder. Silencing of the Fmr1 gene leads to the absence of the protein product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which represses translation of many target mRNAs. Excess translation of these targets is one cause of neuronal dysfunction in FXS. Utilizing the Drosophila model of FXS, we identified the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) Wallenda/dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) as a critical target of FMRP. dFMRP binds Wallenda mRNA and is required to limit Wallenda protein levels. In dFmr1 mutants, Wallenda signaling drives defects in synaptic development, neuronal morphology, and behavior. Pharmacological inhibition of Wallenda in larvae suppresses dFmr1 neurodevelopmental phenotypes, while adult administration prevents dFmr1 behavioral defects. We propose that in dFmr1 mutants chronic Wallenda/DLK signaling disrupts nervous system development and function and that inhibition of this kinase cascade might be a candidate therapeutic intervention for the treatment of FXS.

Abstract: Summary
DLX transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of the developing vertebrate brain, driving forebrain GABAergic neuronal differentiation. Ablation of Dlx1&2 alters expression of genes that are critical for forebrain GABAergic development. We integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses, complemented with in situ hybridization (ISH), and in vivo and in vitro studies of regulatory element (RE) function. This revealed the DLX-organized gene regulatory network at genomic, cellular, and spatial levels in mouse embryonic basal ganglia. DLX TFs perform dual activating and repressing functions; the consequences of their binding were determined by the sequence and genomic context of target loci. Our results reveal and, in part, explain the paradox of widespread DLX binding contrasted with a limited subset of target loci that are sensitive at the epigenomic and transcriptomic level to Dlx1&2 ablation. The regulatory properties identified here for DLX TFs suggest general mechanisms by which TFs orchestrate dynamic expression programs underlying neurodevelopment.

Abstract: Summary
Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lysophospholipid generated by sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), regulates lymphocyte egress into circulation via S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling, and it controls the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper-17 cells. However, the mechanisms by which receptor-independent SphK1-mediated intracellular S1P levels modulate T cell functionality remains unknown. We show here that SphK1-deficient T cells maintain central memory phenotype and exhibit higher mitochondrial respiration and reduced differentiation to Tregs. Mechanistically, we discovered a direct correlation between SphK1-generated S1P and lipid transcription factor PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) activity, which in turn regulates lipolysis in T cells. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of SphK1 improved metabolic fitness and anti-tumor activity of T cells against murine melanoma. Further, inhibition of SphK1 and PD1 together led to improved control of melanoma. Overall, these data highlight the clinical potential of limiting SphK1/S1P signaling for enhancing anti-tumor-adoptive T cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Unlike the adult mammalian retina, Müller glia (MG) in the adult zebrafish retina are able to dedifferentiate into a “stem cell”-like state and give rise to multipotent progenitor cells upon retinal damage. We show that miR-216a is downregulated in MG after constant intense light lesioning and that miR-216a suppression is necessary and sufficient for MG dedifferentiation and proliferation during retina regeneration. miR-216a targets the H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1l, which is upregulated in proliferating MG after retinal damage. Loss-of-function experiments show that Dot1l is necessary for MG reprogramming and mediates MG proliferation downstream of miR-216a. We further demonstrate that miR-216a and Dot1l regulate MG-mediated retina regeneration through canonical Wnt signaling. This article reports a regulatory mechanism upstream of Wnt signaling during retina regeneration and provides potential targets for enhancing regeneration in the adult mammalian retina.
