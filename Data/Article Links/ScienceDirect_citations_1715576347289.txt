Abstract: Summary
The number one cause of human fetal death are defects in heart development. Because the human embryonic heart is inaccessible and the impacts of mutations, drugs, and environmental factors on the specialized functions of different heart compartments are not captured by in vitro models, determining the underlying causes is difficult. Here, we established a human cardioid platform that recapitulates the development of all major embryonic heart compartments, including right and left ventricles, atria, outflow tract, and atrioventricular canal. By leveraging 2D and 3D differentiation, we efficiently generated progenitor subsets with distinct first, anterior, and posterior second heart field identities. This advance enabled the reproducible generation of cardioids with compartment-specific in vivo-like gene expression profiles, morphologies, and functions. We used this platform to unravel the ontogeny of signal and contraction propagation between interacting heart chambers and dissect how mutations, teratogens, and drugs cause compartment-specific defects in the developing human heart.

Abstract: Summary
Autozygosity is associated with rare Mendelian disorders and clinically relevant quantitative traits. We investigated associations between the fraction of the genome in runs of homozygosity (FROH) and common diseases in Genes & Health (n = 23,978 British South Asians), UK Biobank (n = 397,184), and 23andMe. We show that restricting analysis to offspring of first cousins is an effective way of reducing confounding due to social/environmental correlates of FROH. Within this group in G&H+UK Biobank, we found experiment-wide significant associations between FROH and twelve common diseases. We replicated associations with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and post-traumatic stress disorder via within-sibling analysis in 23andMe (median n = 480,282). We estimated that autozygosity due to consanguinity accounts for 5%–18% of T2D cases among British Pakistanis. Our work highlights the possibility of widespread non-additive genetic effects on common diseases and has important implications for global populations with high rates of consanguinity.

Abstract: Summary
Colorectal cancer exhibits dynamic cellular and genetic heterogeneity during progression from precursor lesions toward malignancy. Analysis of spatial multi-omic data from 31 human colorectal specimens enabled phylogeographic mapping of tumor evolution that revealed individualized progression trajectories and accompanying microenvironmental and clonal alterations. Phylogeographic mapping ordered genetic events, classified tumors by their evolutionary dynamics, and placed clonal regions along global pseudotemporal progression trajectories encompassing the chromosomal instability (CIN+) and hypermutated (HM) pathways. Integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data revealed recurring epithelial programs and infiltrating immune states along progression pseudotime. We discovered an immune exclusion signature (IEX), consisting of extracellular matrix regulators DDR1, TGFBI, PAK4, and DPEP1, that charts with CIN+ tumor progression, is associated with reduced cytotoxic cell infiltration, and shows prognostic value in independent cohorts. This spatial multi-omic atlas provides insights into colorectal tumor-microenvironment co-evolution, serving as a resource for stratification and targeted treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Transfer RNA (tRNA) modifications are critical for protein synthesis. Queuosine (Q), a 7-deaza-guanosine derivative, is present in tRNA anticodons. In vertebrate tRNAs for Tyr and Asp, Q is further glycosylated with galactose and mannose to generate galQ and manQ, respectively. However, biogenesis and physiological relevance of Q-glycosylation remain poorly understood. Here, we biochemically identified two RNA glycosylases, QTGAL and QTMAN, and successfully reconstituted Q-glycosylation of tRNAs using nucleotide diphosphate sugars. Ribosome profiling of knockout cells revealed that Q-glycosylation slowed down elongation at cognate codons, UAC and GAC (GAU), respectively. We also found that galactosylation of Q suppresses stop codon readthrough. Moreover, protein aggregates increased in cells lacking Q-glycosylation, indicating that Q-glycosylation contributes to proteostasis. Cryo-EM of human ribosome-tRNA complex revealed the molecular basis of codon recognition regulated by Q-glycosylations. Furthermore, zebrafish qtgal and qtman knockout lines displayed shortened body length, implying that Q-glycosylation is required for post-embryonic growth in vertebrates.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer. However, mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming and how altered metabolism in turn enhances tumorigenicity are poorly understood. Here, we report that arginine levels are elevated in murine and patient hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), despite reduced expression of arginine synthesis genes. Tumor cells accumulate high levels of arginine due to increased uptake and reduced arginine-to-polyamine conversion. Importantly, the high levels of arginine promote tumor formation via further metabolic reprogramming, including changes in glucose, amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism. Mechanistically, arginine binds RNA-binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) to control expression of metabolic genes. RBM39-mediated upregulation of asparagine synthesis leads to enhanced arginine uptake, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain high arginine levels and oncogenic metabolism. Thus, arginine is a second messenger-like molecule that reprograms metabolism to promote tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
MLL/KMT2A amplifications and translocations are prevalent in infant, adult, and therapy-induced leukemia. However, the molecular contributor(s) to these alterations are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that histone H3 lysine 9 mono- and di-methylation (H3K9me1/2) balance at the MLL/KMT2A locus regulates these amplifications and rearrangements. This balance is controlled by the crosstalk between lysine demethylase KDM3B and methyltransferase G9a/EHMT2. KDM3B depletion increases H3K9me1/2 levels and reduces CTCF occupancy at the MLL/KMT2A locus, in turn promoting amplification and rearrangements. Depleting CTCF is also sufficient to generate these focal alterations. Furthermore, the chemotherapy doxorubicin (Dox), which associates with therapy-induced leukemia and promotes MLL/KMT2A amplifications and rearrangements, suppresses KDM3B and CTCF protein levels. KDM3B and CTCF overexpression rescues Dox-induced MLL/KMT2A alterations. G9a inhibition in human cells or mice also suppresses MLL/KMT2A events accompanying Dox treatment. Therefore, MLL/KMT2A amplifications and rearrangements are controlled by epigenetic regulators that are tractable drug targets, which has clinical implications.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the rare cells responsible for the lifelong curative effects of hematopoietic cell (HC) transplantation. The demand for clinical-grade HSCs has increased significantly in recent decades, leading to major difficulties in treating patients. A promising but not yet achieved goal is the generation of HSCs from pluripotent stem cells. Here, we have obtained vector- and stroma-free transplantable HSCs by differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using an original one-step culture system. After injection into immunocompromised mice, cells derived from hiPSCs settle in the bone marrow and form a robust multilineage hematopoietic population that can be serially transplanted. Single-cell RNA sequencing shows that this repopulating activity is due to a hematopoietic population that is transcriptionally similar to human embryonic aorta-derived HSCs. Overall, our results demonstrate the generation of HSCs from hiPSCs and will help identify key regulators of HSC production during human ontogeny.

Abstract: Summary
Drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) poses an emerging threat to human health with urgent need for alternative therapeutic approaches. Here, we deciphered the B cell and antibody response to the virulence-associated type III secretion system (T3SS) in a cohort of patients chronically infected with PA. Single-cell analytics revealed a diverse B cell receptor repertoire directed against the T3SS needle-tip protein PcrV, enabling the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) abrogating T3SS-mediated cytotoxicity. Mechanistic studies involving cryoelectron microscopy identified a surface-exposed C-terminal PcrV epitope as the target of highly neutralizing mAbs with broad activity against drug-resistant PA isolates. These anti-PcrV mAbs were as effective as treatment with conventional antibiotics in vivo. Our study reveals that chronically infected patients represent a source of neutralizing antibodies, which can be exploited as therapeutics against PA.

Abstract: Summary
Fatty acids (FAs) play a central metabolic role in living cells as constituents of membranes, cellular energy reserves, and second messenger precursors. A 2.6 MDa FA synthase (FAS), where the enzymatic reactions and structures are known, is responsible for FA biosynthesis in yeast. Essential in the yeast FAS catalytic cycle is the acyl carrier protein (ACP) that actively shuttles substrates, biosynthetic intermediates, and products from one active site to another. We resolve the S. cerevisiae FAS structure at 1.9 Å, elucidating cofactors and water networks involved in their recognition. Structural snapshots of ACP domains bound to various enzymatic domains allow the reconstruction of a full yeast FA biosynthesis cycle. The structural information suggests that each FAS functional unit could accommodate exogenous proteins to incorporate various enzymatic activities, and we show proof-of-concept experiments where ectopic proteins are used to modulate FAS product profiles.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated hydrocephalus (TAH) is a common and lethal complication of brain metastases. Although other factors beyond mechanical obstructions have been suggested, the exact mechanisms are unknown. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we find that a distinct population of mast cells locate in the choroid plexus and dramatically increase during TAH. Genetic fate tracing and intracranial mast-cell-specific tryptase knockout showed that choroid plexus mast cells (CPMCs) disrupt cilia of choroid plexus epithelia via the tryptase-PAR2-FoxJ1 pathway and consequently increase cerebrospinal fluid production. Mast cells are also found in the human choroid plexus. Levels of tryptase in cerebrospinal fluid are closely associated with clinical severity of TAH. BMS-262084, an inhibitor of tryptase, can cross the blood-brain barrier, inhibit TAH in vivo, and alleviate mast-cell-induced damage of epithelial cilia in a human pluripotent stem-cell-derived choroid plexus organoid model. Collectively, we uncover the function of CPMCs and provide an attractive therapy for TAH.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we report the design, construction, and characterization of a tRNA neochromosome, a designer chromosome that functions as an additional, de novo counterpart to the native complement of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Intending to address one of the central design principles of the Sc2.0 project, the ∼190-kb tRNA neochromosome houses all 275 relocated nuclear tRNA genes. To maximize stability, the design incorporates orthogonal genetic elements from non-S. cerevisiae yeast species. Furthermore, the presence of 283 rox recombination sites enables an orthogonal tRNA SCRaMbLE system. Following construction in yeast, we obtained evidence of a potent selective force, manifesting as a spontaneous doubling in cell ploidy. Furthermore, tRNA sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics, nucleosome mapping, replication profiling, FISH, and Hi-C were undertaken to investigate questions of tRNA neochromosome behavior and function. Its construction demonstrates the remarkable tractability of the yeast model and opens up opportunities to directly test hypotheses surrounding these essential non-coding RNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Recent work has identified dozens of non-coding loci for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk, but their mechanisms and AD transcriptional regulatory circuitry are poorly understood. Here, we profile epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes of 850,000 nuclei from prefrontal cortexes of 92 individuals with and without AD to build a map of the brain regulome, including epigenomic profiles, transcriptional regulators, co-accessibility modules, and peak-to-gene links in a cell-type-specific manner. We develop methods for multimodal integration and detecting regulatory modules using peak-to-gene linking. We show AD risk loci are enriched in microglial enhancers and for specific TFs including SPI1, ELF2, and RUNX1. We detect 9,628 cell-type-specific ATAC-QTL loci, which we integrate alongside peak-to-gene links to prioritize AD variant regulatory circuits. We report differential accessibility of regulatory modules in late AD in glia and in early AD in neurons. Strikingly, late-stage AD brains show global epigenome dysregulation indicative of epigenome erosion and cell identity loss.

Abstract: Summary
Super-enhancers are compound regulatory elements that control expression of key cell identity genes. They recruit high levels of tissue-specific transcription factors and co-activators such as the Mediator complex and contact target gene promoters with high frequency. Most super-enhancers contain multiple constituent regulatory elements, but it is unclear whether these elements have distinct roles in activating target gene expression. Here, by rebuilding the endogenous multipartite α-globin super-enhancer, we show that it contains bioinformatically equivalent but functionally distinct element types: classical enhancers and facilitator elements. Facilitators have no intrinsic enhancer activity, yet in their absence, classical enhancers are unable to fully upregulate their target genes. Without facilitators, classical enhancers exhibit reduced Mediator recruitment, enhancer RNA transcription, and enhancer-promoter interactions. Facilitators are interchangeable but display functional hierarchy based on their position within a multipartite enhancer. Facilitators thus play an important role in potentiating the activity of classical enhancers and ensuring robust activation of target genes.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian oocytes are filled with poorly understood structures called cytoplasmic lattices. First discovered in the 1960s and speculated to correspond to mammalian yolk, ribosomal arrays, or intermediate filaments, their function has remained enigmatic to date. Here, we show that cytoplasmic lattices are sites where oocytes store essential proteins for early embryonic development. Using super-resolution light microscopy and cryoelectron tomography, we show that cytoplasmic lattices are composed of filaments with a high surface area, which contain PADI6 and subcortical maternal complex proteins. The lattices associate with many proteins critical for embryonic development, including proteins that control epigenetic reprogramming of the preimplantation embryo. Loss of cytoplasmic lattices by knocking out PADI6 or the subcortical maternal complex prevents the accumulation of these proteins and results in early embryonic arrest. Our work suggests that cytoplasmic lattices enrich maternally provided proteins to prevent their premature degradation and cellular activity, thereby enabling early mammalian development.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell analysis in living humans is essential for understanding disease mechanisms, but it is impractical in non-regenerative organs, such as the eye and brain, because tissue biopsies would cause serious damage. We resolve this problem by integrating proteomics of liquid biopsies with single-cell transcriptomics from all known ocular cell types to trace the cellular origin of 5,953 proteins detected in the aqueous humor. We identified hundreds of cell-specific protein markers, including for individual retinal cell types. Surprisingly, our results reveal that retinal degeneration occurs in Parkinson’s disease, and the cells driving diabetic retinopathy switch with disease stage. Finally, we developed artificial intelligence (AI) models to assess individual cellular aging and found that many eye diseases not associated with chronological age undergo accelerated molecular aging of disease-specific cell types. Our approach, which can be applied to other organ systems, has the potential to transform molecular diagnostics and prognostics while uncovering new cellular disease and aging mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment remain poorly understood. To address this, we generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the aged human prefrontal cortex covering 2.3 million cells from postmortem human brain samples of 427 individuals with varying degrees of AD pathology and cognitive impairment. Our analyses identified AD-pathology-associated alterations shared between excitatory neuron subtypes, revealed a coordinated increase of the cohesin complex and DNA damage response factors in excitatory neurons and in oligodendrocytes, and uncovered genes and pathways associated with high cognitive function, dementia, and resilience to AD pathology. Furthermore, we identified selectively vulnerable somatostatin inhibitory neuron subtypes depleted in AD, discovered two distinct groups of inhibitory neurons that were more abundant in individuals with preserved high cognitive function late in life, and uncovered a link between inhibitory neurons and resilience to AD pathology.

Abstract: Summary
MXRA8 is a receptor for chikungunya (CHIKV) and other arthritogenic alphaviruses with mammalian hosts. However, mammalian MXRA8 does not bind to alphaviruses that infect humans and have avian reservoirs. Here, we show that avian, but not mammalian, MXRA8 can act as a receptor for Sindbis, western equine encephalitis (WEEV), and related alphaviruses with avian reservoirs. Structural analysis of duck MXRA8 complexed with WEEV reveals an inverted binding mode compared with mammalian MXRA8 bound to CHIKV. Whereas both domains of mammalian MXRA8 bind CHIKV E1 and E2, only domain 1 of avian MXRA8 engages WEEV E1, and no appreciable contacts are made with WEEV E2. Using these results, we generated a chimeric avian-mammalian MXRA8 decoy-receptor that neutralizes infection of multiple alphaviruses from distinct antigenic groups in vitro and in vivo. Thus, different alphaviruses can bind MXRA8 encoded by different vertebrate classes with distinct engagement modes, which enables development of broad-spectrum inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
In adult mammals, skin wounds typically heal by scarring rather than through regeneration. In contrast, “super-healer” Murphy Roths Large (MRL) mice have the unusual ability to regenerate ear punch wounds; however, the molecular basis for this regeneration remains elusive. Here, in hybrid crosses between MRL and non-regenerating mice, we used allele-specific gene expression to identify cis-regulatory variation associated with ear regeneration. Analyzing three major cell populations (immune, fibroblast, and endothelial), we found that genes with cis-regulatory differences specifically in fibroblasts were associated with wound-healing pathways and also co-localized with quantitative trait loci for ear wound-healing. Ectopic treatment with one of these proteins, complement factor H (CFH), accelerated wound repair and induced regeneration in typically fibrotic wounds. Through single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we observed that CFH treatment dramatically reduced immune cell recruitment to wounds, suggesting a potential mechanism for CFH’s effect. Overall, our results provide insights into the molecular drivers of regeneration with potential clinical implications.

Abstract: Summary
Organ regeneration requires dynamic cell interactions to reestablish cell numbers and tissue architecture. While we know the identity of progenitor cells that replace lost tissue, the transient states they give rise to and their role in repair remain elusive. Here, using multiple injury models, we find that alveolar fibroblasts acquire distinct states marked by Sfrp1 and Runx1 that influence tissue remodeling and reorganization. Unexpectedly, ablation of alveolar epithelial type-1 (AT1) cells alone is sufficient to induce tissue remodeling and transitional states. Integrated scRNA-seq followed by genetic interrogation reveals RUNX1 is a key driver of fibroblast states. Importantly, the ectopic induction or accumulation of epithelial transitional states induce rapid formation of transient alveolar fibroblasts, leading to organ-wide fibrosis. Conversely, the elimination of epithelial or fibroblast transitional states or RUNX1 loss, leads to tissue simplification resembling emphysema. This work uncovered a key role for transitional states in orchestrating tissue topologies during regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular perturbations underlying Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are primarily studied in human postmortem samples and model organisms. Here, we generated a single-nucleus atlas from a rare cohort of cortical biopsies from living individuals with varying degrees of AD pathology. We next performed a systematic cross-disease and cross-species integrative analysis to identify a set of cell states that are specific to early AD pathology. These changes—which we refer to as the early cortical amyloid response—were prominent in neurons, wherein we identified a transitional hyperactive state preceding the loss of excitatory neurons, which we confirmed by acute slice physiology on independent biopsy specimens. Microglia overexpressing neuroinflammatory-related processes also expanded as AD pathology increased. Finally, both oligodendrocytes and pyramidal neurons upregulated genes associated with β-amyloid production and processing during this early hyperactive phase. Our integrative analysis provides an organizing framework for targeting circuit dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and amyloid production early in AD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons build synaptic contacts using different protein combinations that define the specificity, function, and plasticity potential of synapses; however, the diversity of synaptic proteomes remains largely unexplored. We prepared synaptosomes from 7 different transgenic mouse lines with fluorescently labeled presynaptic terminals. Combining microdissection of 5 different brain regions with fluorescent-activated synaptosome sorting (FASS), we isolated and analyzed the proteomes of 18 different synapse types. We discovered ∼1,800 unique synapse-type-enriched proteins and allocated thousands of proteins to different types of synapses (https://syndive.org/). We identify shared synaptic protein modules and highlight the proteomic hotspots for synapse specialization. We reveal unique and common features of the striatal dopaminergic proteome and discover the proteome signatures that relate to the functional properties of different interneuron classes. This study provides a molecular systems-biology analysis of synapses and a framework to integrate proteomic information for synapse subtypes of interest with cellular or circuit-level experiments.

Abstract: Summary
Expansions of repeat DNA tracts cause >70 diseases, and ongoing expansions in brains exacerbate disease. During expansion mutations, single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) form slipped-DNAs. We find the ssDNA-binding complexes canonical replication protein A (RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3) and Alternative-RPA (RPA1, RPA3, and primate-specific RPA4) are upregulated in Huntington disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) patient brains. Protein interactomes of RPA and Alt-RPA reveal unique and shared partners, including modifiers of CAG instability and disease presentation. RPA enhances in vitro melting, FAN1 excision, and repair of slipped-CAGs and protects against CAG expansions in human cells. RPA overexpression in SCA1 mouse brains ablates expansions, coincident with decreased ATXN1 aggregation, reduced brain DNA damage, improved neuron morphology, and rescued motor phenotypes. In contrast, Alt-RPA inhibits melting, FAN1 excision, and repair of slipped-CAGs and promotes CAG expansions. These findings suggest a functional interplay between the two RPAs where Alt-RPA may antagonistically offset RPA’s suppression of disease-associated repeat expansions, which may extend to other DNA processes.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T cells play fundamental roles in orchestrating immune responses and tissue homeostasis. However, our inability to associate peptide human leukocyte antigen class-II (HLA-II) complexes with their cognate T cell receptors (TCRs) in an unbiased manner has hampered our understanding of CD4+ T cell function and role in pathologies. Here, we introduce TScan-II, a highly sensitive genome-scale CD4+ antigen discovery platform. This platform seamlessly integrates the endogenous HLA-II antigen-processing machinery in synthetic antigen-presenting cells and TCR signaling in T cells, enabling the simultaneous screening of multiple HLAs and TCRs. Leveraging genome-scale human, virome, and epitope mutagenesis libraries, TScan-II facilitates de novo antigen discovery and deep exploration of TCR specificity. We demonstrate TScan-II’s potential for basic and translational research by identifying a non-canonical antigen for a cancer-reactive CD4+ T cell clone. Additionally, we identified two antigens for clonally expanded CD4+ T cells in Sjögren’s disease, which bind distinct HLAs and are expressed in HLA-II-positive ductal cells within affected salivary glands.

Abstract: Summary
Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) can model personalized therapy responses; however, current screening technologies cannot reveal drug response mechanisms or how tumor microenvironment cells alter therapeutic performance. To address this, we developed a highly multiplexed mass cytometry platform to measure post-translational modification (PTM) signaling, DNA damage, cell-cycle activity, and apoptosis in >2,500 colorectal cancer (CRC) PDOs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in response to clinical therapies at single-cell resolution. To compare patient- and microenvironment-specific drug responses in thousands of single-cell datasets, we developed “Trellis”—a highly scalable, tree-based treatment effect analysis method. Trellis single-cell screening revealed that on-target cell-cycle blockage and DNA-damage drug effects are common, even in chemorefractory PDOs. However, drug-induced apoptosis is rarer, patient-specific, and aligns with cancer cell PTM signaling. We find that CAFs can regulate PDO plasticity—shifting proliferative colonic stem cells (proCSCs) to slow-cycling revival colonic stem cells (revCSCs) to protect cancer cells from chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we used unbiased systems approaches to study the host-selective forces driving VOC evolution. We discovered that VOCs evolved convergent strategies to remodel the host by modulating viral RNA and protein levels, altering viral and host protein phosphorylation, and rewiring virus-host protein-protein interactions. Integrative computational analyses revealed that although Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta ultimately converged to suppress interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), Omicron BA.1 did not. ISG suppression correlated with the expression of viral innate immune antagonist proteins, including Orf6, N, and Orf9b, which we mapped to specific mutations. Later Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 more potently suppressed innate immunity than early subvariant BA.1, which correlated with Orf6 levels, although muted in BA.4 by a mutation that disrupts the Orf6-nuclear pore interaction. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 convergent evolution overcame human adaptive and innate immune barriers, laying the groundwork to tackle future pandemics.

Abstract: Summary
The rise and fall of the Roman Empire was a socio-political process with enormous ramifications for human history. The Middle Danube was a crucial frontier and a crossroads for population and cultural movement. Here, we present genome-wide data from 136 Balkan individuals dated to the 1st millennium CE. Despite extensive militarization and cultural influence, we find little ancestry contribution from peoples of Italic descent. However, we trace a large-scale influx of people of Anatolian ancestry during the Imperial period. Between ∼250 and 550 CE, we detect migrants with ancestry from Central/Northern Europe and the Steppe, confirming that “barbarian” migrations were propelled by ethnically diverse confederations. Following the end of Roman control, we detect the large-scale arrival of individuals who were genetically similar to modern Eastern European Slavic-speaking populations, who contributed 30%–60% of the ancestry of Balkan people, representing one of the largest permanent demographic changes anywhere in Europe during the Migration Period.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the CNS. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) contributes to the MS pathogenesis because high levels of EBV EBNA386–405-specific antibodies cross react with the CNS-derived GlialCAM370–389. However, it is unclear why only some individuals with such high autoreactive antibody titers develop MS. Here, we show that autoreactive cells are eliminated by distinct immune responses, which are determined by genetic variations of the host, as well as of the infecting EBV and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). We demonstrate that potent cytotoxic NKG2C+ and NKG2D+ natural killer (NK) cells and distinct EBV-specific T cell responses kill autoreactive GlialCAM370–389-specific cells. Furthermore, immune evasion of these autoreactive cells was induced by EBV-variant-specific upregulation of the immunomodulatory HLA-E. These defined virus and host genetic pre-dispositions are associated with an up to 260-fold increased risk of MS. Our findings thus allow the early identification of patients at risk for MS and suggest additional therapeutic options against MS.

Abstract: Summary
Human inherited disorders of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) immunity underlie severe mycobacterial diseases. We report X-linked recessive MCTS1 deficiency in men with mycobacterial disease from kindreds of different ancestries (from China, Finland, Iran, and Saudi Arabia). Complete deficiency of this translation re-initiation factor impairs the translation of a subset of proteins, including the kinase JAK2 in all cell types tested, including T lymphocytes and phagocytes. JAK2 expression is sufficiently low to impair cellular responses to interleukin-23 (IL-23) and partially IL-12, but not other JAK2-dependent cytokines. Defective responses to IL-23 preferentially impair the production of IFN-γ by innate-like adaptive mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) and γδ T lymphocytes upon mycobacterial challenge. Surprisingly, the lack of MCTS1-dependent translation re-initiation and ribosome recycling seems to be otherwise physiologically redundant in these patients. These findings suggest that X-linked recessive human MCTS1 deficiency underlies isolated mycobacterial disease by impairing JAK2 translation in innate-like adaptive T lymphocytes, thereby impairing the IL-23-dependent induction of IFN-γ.

Abstract: Summary
To understand the molecular mechanisms of cellular pathways, contemporary workflows typically require multiple techniques to identify proteins, track their localization, and determine their structures in vitro. Here, we combined cellular cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) and AlphaFold2 modeling to address these questions and understand how mammalian sperm are built in situ. Our cellular cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging provided 6.0-Å reconstructions of axonemal microtubule structures. The well-resolved tertiary structures allowed us to unbiasedly match sperm-specific densities with 21,615 AlphaFold2-predicted protein models of the mouse proteome. We identified Tektin 5, CCDC105, and SPACA9 as novel microtubule-associated proteins. These proteins form an extensive interaction network crosslinking the lumen of axonemal doublet microtubules, suggesting their roles in modulating the mechanical properties of the filaments. Indeed, Tekt5 −/− sperm possess more deformed flagella with 180° bends. Together, our studies presented a cellular visual proteomics workflow and shed light on the in vivo functions of Tektin 5.

Abstract: Summary
The meninges lie in the interface between the skull and brain, harboring lymphatic vasculature and skull progenitor cells (SPCs). How the skull and brain communicate remains largely unknown. We found that impaired meningeal lymphatics and brain perfusion drive neurocognitive defects in Twist1+/− mice, an animal model of craniosynostosis recapitulating human Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Loss of SPCs leads to skull deformities and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), whereas transplanting SPCs back into mutant mice mitigates lymphatic and brain defects through two mechanisms: (1) decreasing elevated ICP by skull correction and (2) promoting the growth and migration of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) via SPC-secreted vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C). Treating Twist1+/− mice with VEGF-C promotes meningeal lymphatic growth and rescues defects in ICP, brain perfusion, and neurocognitive functions. Thus, the skull functionally integrates with the brain via meningeal lymphatics, which is impaired in craniosynostosis and can be restored by SPC-driven lymphatic activation via VEGF-C.

Abstract: Summary
The liver is known for its remarkable regenerative ability through proliferation of hepatocytes. Yet, during chronic injury or severe hepatocyte death, proliferation of hepatocytes is exhausted. To overcome this hurdle, we propose vascular-endothelial-growth-factor A (VEGFA) as a therapeutic means to accelerate biliary epithelial-cell (BEC)-to-hepatocyte conversion. Investigation in zebrafish establishes that blocking VEGF receptors abrogates BEC-driven liver repair, while VEGFA overexpression promotes it. Delivery of VEGFA via nonintegrative and safe nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) in acutely or chronically injured mouse livers induces robust BEC-to-hepatocyte conversion and elimination of steatosis and fibrosis. In human and murine diseased livers, we further identified VEGFA-receptor KDR-expressing BECs associated with KDR-expressing cell-derived hepatocytes. This work defines KDR-expressing cells, most likely being BECs, as facultative progenitors. This study reveals unexpected therapeutic benefits of VEGFA delivered via nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP, whose safety is widely validated with COVID-19 vaccines, for harnessing BEC-driven repair to potentially treat liver diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The assembly of the neuronal and other major cell type programs occurred early in animal evolution. We can reconstruct this process by studying non-bilaterians like placozoans. These small disc-shaped animals not only have nine morphologically described cell types and no neurons but also show coordinated behaviors triggered by peptide-secreting cells. We investigated possible neuronal affinities of these peptidergic cells using phylogenetics, chromatin profiling, and comparative single-cell genomics in four placozoans. We found conserved cell type expression programs across placozoans, including populations of transdifferentiating and cycling cells, suggestive of active cell type homeostasis. We also uncovered fourteen peptidergic cell types expressing neuronal-associated components like the pre-synaptic scaffold that derive from progenitor cells with neurogenesis signatures. In contrast, earlier-branching animals like sponges and ctenophores lacked this conserved expression. Our findings indicate that key neuronal developmental and effector gene modules evolved before the advent of cnidarian/bilaterian neurons in the context of paracrine cell signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Most organs have tissue-resident immune cells. Human organoids lack these immune cells, which limits their utility in modeling many normal and disease processes. Here, we describe that pluripotent stem cell-derived human colonic organoids (HCOs) co-develop a diverse population of immune cells, including hemogenic endothelium (HE)-like cells and erythromyeloid progenitors that undergo stereotypical steps in differentiation, resulting in the generation of functional macrophages. HCO macrophages acquired a transcriptional signature resembling human fetal small and large intestine tissue-resident macrophages. HCO macrophages modulate cytokine secretion in response to pro- and anti-inflammatory signals and were able to phagocytose and mount a robust response to pathogenic bacteria. When transplanted into mice, HCO macrophages were maintained within the colonic organoid tissue, established a close association with the colonic epithelium, and were not displaced by the host bone-marrow-derived macrophages. These studies suggest that HE in HCOs gives rise to multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and functional tissue-resident macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) autoantibodies cause NMDAR encephalitis, the most common autoimmune encephalitis, leading to psychosis, seizures, and autonomic dysfunction. Current treatments comprise broad immunosuppression or non-selective antibody removal. We developed NMDAR-specific chimeric autoantibody receptor (NMDAR-CAAR) T cells to selectively eliminate anti-NMDAR B cells and disease-causing autoantibodies. NMDAR-CAARs consist of an extracellular multi-subunit NMDAR autoantigen fused to intracellular 4-1BB/CD3ζ domains. NMDAR-CAAR T cells recognize a large panel of human patient-derived autoantibodies, release effector molecules, proliferate, and selectively kill antigen-specific target cell lines even in the presence of high autoantibody concentrations. In a passive transfer mouse model, NMDAR-CAAR T cells led to depletion of an anti-NMDAR B cell line and sustained reduction of autoantibody levels without notable off-target toxicity. Treatment of patients may reduce side effects, prevent relapses, and improve long-term prognosis. Our preclinical work paves the way for CAAR T cell phase I/II trials in NMDAR encephalitis and further autoantibody-mediated diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Itch is an unpleasant sensation that evokes a desire to scratch. The skin barrier is constantly exposed to microbes and their products. However, the role of microbes in itch generation is unknown. Here, we show that Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterial pathogen associated with itchy skin diseases, directly activates pruriceptor sensory neurons to drive itch. Epicutaneous S. aureus exposure causes robust itch and scratch-induced damage. By testing multiple isogenic bacterial mutants for virulence factors, we identify the S. aureus serine protease V8 as a critical mediator in evoking spontaneous itch and alloknesis. V8 cleaves proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) on mouse and human sensory neurons. Targeting PAR1 through genetic deficiency, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown, or pharmacological blockade decreases itch and skin damage caused by V8 and S. aureus exposure. Thus, we identify a mechanism of action for a pruritogenic bacterial factor and demonstrate the potential of inhibiting V8-PAR1 signaling to treat itch.

Abstract: Summary
Cytoplasmic divisions are thought to rely on nuclear divisions and mitotic signals. We demonstrate in Drosophila embryos that cytoplasm can divide repeatedly without nuclei and mitotic CDK/cyclin complexes. Cdk1 normally slows an otherwise faster cytoplasmic division cycle, coupling it with nuclear divisions, and when uncoupled, cytoplasm starts dividing before mitosis. In developing embryos where CDK/cyclin activity can license mitotic microtubule (MT) organizers like the spindle, cytoplasmic divisions can occur without the centrosome, a principal organizer of interphase MTs. However, centrosomes become essential in the absence of CDK/cyclin activity, implying that the cytoplasm can employ either the centrosome-based interphase or CDK/cyclin-dependent mitotic MTs to facilitate its divisions. Finally, we present evidence that autonomous cytoplasmic divisions occur during unperturbed fly embryogenesis and that they may help extrude mitotically stalled nuclei during blastoderm formation. We postulate that cytoplasmic divisions occur in cycles governed by a yet-to-be-uncovered clock mechanism autonomous from CDK/cyclin complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Most animals require sleep, and sleep loss induces serious pathophysiological consequences, including death. Previous experimental approaches for investigating sleep impacts in mice have been unable to persistently deprive animals of both rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS). Here, we report a “curling prevention by water” paradigm wherein mice remain awake 96% of the time. After 4 days of exposure, mice exhibit severe inflammation, and approximately 80% die. Sleep deprivation increases levels of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) in the brain, and we found that elevated PGD2 efflux across the blood-brain-barrier—mediated by ATP-binding cassette subfamily C4 transporter—induces both accumulation of circulating neutrophils and a cytokine-storm-like syndrome. Experimental disruption of the PGD2/DP1 axis dramatically reduced sleep-deprivation-induced inflammation. Thus, our study reveals that sleep-related changes in PGD2 in the central nervous system drive profound pathological consequences in the peripheral immune system.

Abstract: Summary
Polarized cells rely on a polarized cytoskeleton to function. Yet, how cortical polarity cues induce cytoskeleton polarization remains elusive. Here, we capitalized on recently established designed 2D protein arrays to ectopically engineer cortical polarity of virtually any protein of interest during mitosis in various cell types. This enables direct manipulation of polarity signaling and the identification of the cortical cues sufficient for cytoskeleton polarization. Using this assay, we dissected the logic of the Par complex pathway, a key regulator of cytoskeleton polarity during asymmetric cell division. We show that cortical clustering of any Par complex subunit is sufficient to trigger complex assembly and that the primary kinetic barrier to complex assembly is the relief of Par6 autoinhibition. Further, we found that inducing cortical Par complex polarity induces two hallmarks of asymmetric cell division in unpolarized mammalian cells: spindle orientation, occurring via Par3, and central spindle asymmetry, depending on aPKC activity.

Abstract: Summary
Bats, rodents, and shrews are the most important animal sources of human infectious diseases. However, the evolution and transmission of viruses among them remain largely unexplored. Through the meta-transcriptomic sequencing of internal organ and fecal samples from 2,443 wild bats, rodents, and shrews sampled from four Chinese habitats, we identified 669 viruses, including 534 novel viruses, thereby greatly expanding the mammalian virome. Our analysis revealed high levels of phylogenetic diversity, identified cross-species virus transmission events, elucidated virus origins, and identified cases of invertebrate viruses in mammalian hosts. Host order and sample size were the most important factors impacting virome composition and patterns of virus spillover. Shrews harbored a high richness of viruses, including many invertebrate-associated viruses with multi-organ distributions, whereas rodents carried viruses with a greater capacity for host jumping. These data highlight the remarkable diversity of mammalian viruses in local habitats and their ability to emerge in new hosts.

Abstract: Summary
Short tandem repeat (STR) instability causes transcriptional silencing in several repeat expansion disorders. In fragile X syndrome (FXS), mutation-length expansion of a CGG STR represses FMR1 via local DNA methylation. Here, we find megabase-scale H3K9me3 domains on autosomes and encompassing FMR1 on the X chromosome in FXS patient-derived iPSCs, iPSC-derived neural progenitors, EBV-transformed lymphoblasts, and brain tissue with mutation-length CGG expansion. H3K9me3 domains connect via inter-chromosomal interactions and demarcate severe misfolding of TADs and loops. They harbor long synaptic genes replicating at the end of S phase, replication-stress-induced double-strand breaks, and STRs prone to stepwise somatic instability. CRISPR engineering of the mutation-length CGG to premutation length reverses H3K9me3 on the X chromosome and multiple autosomes, refolds TADs, and restores gene expression. H3K9me3 domains can also arise in normal-length iPSCs created with perturbations linked to genome instability, suggesting their relevance beyond FXS. Our results reveal Mb-scale heterochromatinization and trans interactions among loci susceptible to instability.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells are regulated by oncogenic mutations and microenvironmental signals, yet these processes are often studied separately. To functionally map how cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic cues co-regulate cell fate, we performed a systematic single-cell analysis of 1,107 colonic organoid cultures regulated by (1) colorectal cancer (CRC) oncogenic mutations, (2) microenvironmental fibroblasts and macrophages, (3) stromal ligands, and (4) signaling inhibitors. Multiplexed single-cell analysis revealed a stepwise epithelial differentiation phenoscape dictated by combinations of oncogenes and stromal ligands, spanning from fibroblast-induced Clusterin (CLU)+ revival colonic stem cells (revCSCs) to oncogene-driven LRIG1+ hyper-proliferative CSCs (proCSCs). The transition from revCSCs to proCSCs is regulated by decreasing WNT3A and TGF-β-driven YAP signaling and increasing KRASG12D or stromal EGF/Epiregulin-activated MAPK/PI3K flux. We find that APC loss and KRASG12D collaboratively limit access to revCSCs and disrupt stromal-epithelial communication—trapping epithelia in the proCSC fate. These results reveal that oncogenic mutations dominate homeostatic differentiation by obstructing cell-extrinsic regulation of cell-fate plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Progression through fate decisions determines cellular composition and tissue architecture, but how that same architecture may impact cell fate is less clear. We took advantage of organoids as a tractable model to interrogate this interaction of form and fate. Screening methodological variations revealed that common protocol adjustments impacted various aspects of morphology, from macrostructure to tissue architecture. We examined the impact of morphological perturbations on cell fate through integrated single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics. Regardless of the specific protocol, organoids with more complex morphology better mimicked in vivo human fetal brain development. Organoids with perturbed tissue architecture displayed aberrant temporal progression, with cells being intermingled in both space and time. Finally, encapsulation to impart a simplified morphology led to disrupted tissue cytoarchitecture and a similar abnormal maturational timing. These data demonstrate that cells of the developing brain require proper spatial coordinates to undergo correct temporal progression.

Abstract: Summary
Different functional regions of brain are fundamental for basic neurophysiological activities. However, the regional specification remains largely unexplored during human brain development. Here, by combining spatial transcriptomics (scStereo-seq) and scRNA-seq, we built a spatiotemporal developmental atlas of multiple human brain regions from 6–23 gestational weeks (GWs). We discovered that, around GW8, radial glia (RG) cells have displayed regional heterogeneity and specific spatial distribution. Interestingly, we found that the regional heterogeneity of RG subtypes contributed to the subsequent neuronal specification. Specifically, two diencephalon-specific subtypes gave rise to glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, whereas subtypes in ventral midbrain were associated with the dopaminergic neurons. Similar GABAergic neuronal subtypes were shared between neocortex and diencephalon. Additionally, we revealed that cell-cell interactions between oligodendrocyte precursor cells and GABAergic neurons influenced and promoted neuronal development coupled with regional specification. Altogether, this study provides comprehensive insights into the regional specification in the developing human brain.

Abstract: Summary
The Sc2.0 project is building a eukaryotic synthetic genome from scratch. A major milestone has been achieved with all individual Sc2.0 chromosomes assembled. Here, we describe the consolidation of multiple synthetic chromosomes using advanced endoreduplication intercrossing with tRNA expression cassettes to generate a strain with 6.5 synthetic chromosomes. The 3D chromosome organization and transcript isoform profiles were evaluated using Hi-C and long-read direct RNA sequencing. We developed CRISPR Directed Biallelic URA3-assisted Genome Scan, or “CRISPR D-BUGS,” to map phenotypic variants caused by specific designer modifications, known as “bugs.” We first fine-mapped a bug in synthetic chromosome II (synII) and then discovered a combinatorial interaction associated with synIII and synX, revealing an unexpected genetic interaction that links transcriptional regulation, inositol metabolism, and tRNASerCGA abundance. Finally, to expedite consolidation, we employed chromosome substitution to incorporate the largest chromosome (synIV), thereby consolidating >50% of the Sc2.0 genome in one strain.

Abstract: Summary
The enhanced cognitive abilities characterizing the human species result from specialized features of neurons and circuits. Here, we report that the hominid-specific gene LRRC37B encodes a receptor expressed in human cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs) and selectively localized to the axon initial segment (AIS), the subcellular compartment triggering action potentials. Ectopic expression of LRRC37B in mouse CPNs in vivo leads to reduced intrinsic excitability, a distinctive feature of some classes of human CPNs. Molecularly, LRRC37B binds to the secreted ligand FGF13A and to the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) β-subunit SCN1B. LRRC37B concentrates inhibitory effects of FGF13A on Nav channel function, thereby reducing excitability, specifically at the AIS level. Electrophysiological recordings in adult human cortical slices reveal lower neuronal excitability in human CPNs expressing LRRC37B. LRRC37B thus acts as a species-specific modifier of human neuron excitability, linking human genome and cell evolution, with important implications for human brain function and diseases.

We found that interstitial macrophages (IMs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are dominant producers of type I IFN during Mtb infection in mice and non-human primates, and pDCs localize near human Mtb granulomas. Depletion of pDCs reduces Mtb burdens, implicating pDCs in tuberculosis pathogenesis. During IFN-driven disease, we observe abundant DNA-containing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) described to activate pDCs. Cell-type-specific disruption of the type I IFN receptor suggests that IFNs act on IMs to inhibit Mtb control. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) indicates that type I IFN-responsive cells are defective in their response to IFNγ, a cytokine critical for Mtb control. We propose that pDC-derived type I IFNs act on IMs to permit bacterial replication, driving further neutrophil recruitment and active tuberculosis disease.

Abstract: Summary
Conscious perception is greatly diminished during sleep, but the underlying circuit mechanism is poorly understood. We show that cortical ignition—a brain process shown to be associated with conscious awareness in humans and non-human primates—is strongly suppressed during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep in mice due to reduced cholinergic modulation and rapid inhibition of cortical responses. Brain-wide functional ultrasound imaging and cell-type-specific calcium imaging combined with optogenetics showed that activity propagation from visual to frontal cortex is markedly reduced during NREM sleep due to strong inhibition of frontal pyramidal neurons. Chemogenetic activation and inactivation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons powerfully increased and decreased visual-to-frontal activity propagation, respectively. Furthermore, although multiple subtypes of dendrite-targeting GABAergic interneurons in the frontal cortex are more active during wakefulness, soma-targeting parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are more active during sleep. Chemogenetic manipulation of parvalbumin interneurons showed that sleep/wake-dependent cortical ignition is strongly modulated by perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Persistent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in neurons are an early pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with the potential to disrupt genome integrity. We used single-nucleus RNA-seq in human postmortem prefrontal cortex samples and found that excitatory neurons in AD were enriched for somatic mosaic gene fusions. Gene fusions were particularly enriched in excitatory neurons with DNA damage repair and senescence gene signatures. In addition, somatic genome structural variations and gene fusions were enriched in neurons burdened with DSBs in the CK-p25 mouse model of neurodegeneration. Neurons enriched for DSBs also had elevated levels of cohesin along with progressive multiscale disruption of the 3D genome organization aligned with transcriptional changes in synaptic, neuronal development, and histone genes. Overall, this study demonstrates the disruption of genome stability and the 3D genome organization by DSBs in neurons as pathological steps in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes move and evict nucleosomes at gene promoters and enhancers to modulate DNA access. Although SWI/SNF subunits are commonly mutated in disease, therapeutic options are limited by our inability to predict SWI/SNF gene targets and conflicting studies on functional significance. Here, we leverage a fast-acting inhibitor of SWI/SNF remodeling to elucidate direct targets and effects of SWI/SNF. Blocking SWI/SNF activity causes a rapid and global loss of chromatin accessibility and transcription. Whereas repression persists at most enhancers, we uncover a compensatory role for the EP400/TIP60 remodeler, which reestablishes accessibility at most promoters during prolonged loss of SWI/SNF. Indeed, we observe synthetic lethality between EP400 and SWI/SNF in cancer cell lines and human cancer patient data. Our data define a set of molecular genomic features that accurately predict gene sensitivity to SWI/SNF inhibition in diverse cancer cell lines, thereby improving the therapeutic potential of SWI/SNF inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
The evolution and development of the head have long captivated researchers due to the crucial role of the head as the gateway for sensory stimuli and the intricate structural complexity of the head. Although significant progress has been made in understanding head development in various vertebrate species, our knowledge of early human head ontogeny remains limited. Here, we used advanced whole-mount immunostaining and 3D imaging techniques to generate a comprehensive 3D cellular atlas of human head embryogenesis. We present detailed developmental series of diverse head tissues and cell types, including muscles, vasculature, cartilage, peripheral nerves, and exocrine glands. These datasets, accessible through a dedicated web interface, provide insights into human embryogenesis. We offer perspectives on the branching morphogenesis of human exocrine glands and unknown features of the development of neurovascular and skeletomuscular structures. These insights into human embryology have important implications for understanding craniofacial defects and neurological disorders and advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
The large-scale evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been marked by rapid turnover of genetic clades. New variants show intrinsic changes, notably increased transmissibility, and antigenic changes that reduce cross-immunity induced by previous infections or vaccinations. How this functional variation shapes global evolution has remained unclear. Here, we establish a predictive fitness model for SARS-CoV-2 that integrates antigenic and intrinsic selection. The model is informed by tracking of time-resolved sequence data, epidemiological records, and cross-neutralization data of viral variants. Our inference shows that immune pressure, including contributions of vaccinations and previous infections, has become the dominant force driving the recent evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The fitness model can serve continued surveillance in two ways. First, it successfully predicts the short-term evolution of circulating strains and flags emerging variants likely to displace the previously predominant variant. Second, it predicts likely antigenic profiles of successful escape variants prior to their emergence.

Abstract: Summary
Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) represent a large percentage of overall nuclear protein content. The prevailing dogma is that IDRs engage in non-specific interactions because they are poorly constrained by evolutionary selection. Here, we demonstrate that condensate formation and heterotypic interactions are distinct and separable features of an IDR within the ARID1A/B subunits of the mSWI/SNF chromatin remodeler, cBAF, and establish distinct “sequence grammars” underlying each contribution. Condensation is driven by uniformly distributed tyrosine residues, and partner interactions are mediated by non-random blocks rich in alanine, glycine, and glutamine residues. These features concentrate a specific cBAF protein-protein interaction network and are essential for chromatin localization and activity. Importantly, human disease-associated perturbations in ARID1B IDR sequence grammars disrupt cBAF function in cells. Together, these data identify IDR contributions to chromatin remodeling and explain how phase separation provides a mechanism through which both genomic localization and functional partner recruitment are achieved.

Abstract: Summary
Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) has provided unprecedented insights into amyloid fibril structures, including those associated with disease. However, these structures represent the endpoints of long assembly processes, and their relationship to fibrils formed early in assembly is unknown. Consequently, whether different fibril architectures, with potentially different pathological properties, form during assembly remains unknown. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine structures of amyloid fibrils at different times during in vitro fibrillation of a disease-related variant of human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP-S20G). Strikingly, the fibrils formed in the lag, growth, and plateau phases have different structures, with new forms appearing and others disappearing as fibrillation proceeds. A time course with wild-type hIAPP also shows fibrils changing with time, suggesting that this is a general property of IAPP amyloid assembly. The observation of transiently populated fibril structures has implications for understanding amyloid assembly mechanisms with potential new insights into amyloid progression in disease.

Abstract: Summary
Reactivating silenced γ-globin expression through the disruption of repressive regulatory domains offers a therapeutic strategy for treating β-hemoglobinopathies. Here, we used transformer base editor (tBE), a recently developed cytosine base editor with no detectable off-target mutations, to disrupt transcription-factor-binding motifs in hematopoietic stem cells. By performing functional screening of six motifs with tBE, we found that directly disrupting the BCL11A-binding motif in HBG1/2 promoters triggered the highest γ-globin expression. Via a side-by-side comparison with other clinical and preclinical strategies using Cas9 nuclease or conventional BEs (ABE8e and hA3A-BE3), we found that tBE-mediated disruption of the BCL11A-binding motif at the HBG1/2 promoters triggered the highest fetal hemoglobin in healthy and β-thalassemia patient hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells while exhibiting no detectable DNA or RNA off-target mutations. Durable therapeutic editing by tBE persisted in repopulating hematopoietic stem cells, demonstrating that tBE-mediated editing in HBG1/2 promoters is a safe and effective strategy for treating β-hemoglobinopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic development is remarkably robust, but temperature stress can degrade its ability to generate animals with invariant anatomy. Phenotypes associated with environmental stress suggest that some cell types are more sensitive to stress than others, but the basis of this sensitivity is unknown. Here, we characterize hundreds of individual zebrafish embryos under temperature stress using whole-animal single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify cell types and molecular programs driving phenotypic variability. We find that temperature perturbs the normal proportions and gene expression programs of numerous cell types and also introduces asynchrony in developmental timing. The notochord is particularly sensitive to temperature, which we map to a specialized cell type: sheath cells. These cells accumulate misfolded protein at elevated temperature, leading to a cascading structural failure of the notochord and anatomic defects. Our study demonstrates that whole-animal single-cell RNA-seq can identify mechanisms for developmental robustness and pinpoint cell types that constitute key failure points.

Abstract: Summary
The maturation of genomic surveillance in the past decade has enabled tracking of the emergence and spread of epidemics at an unprecedented level. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, genomic data revealed that local epidemics varied considerably in the frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage importation and persistence, likely due to a combination of COVID-19 restrictions and changing connectivity. Here, we show that local COVID-19 epidemics are driven by regional transmission, including across international boundaries, but can become increasingly connected to distant locations following the relaxation of public health interventions. By integrating genomic, mobility, and epidemiological data, we find abundant transmission occurring between both adjacent and distant locations, supported by dynamic mobility patterns. We find that changing connectivity significantly influences local COVID-19 incidence. Our findings demonstrate a complex meaning of “local” when investigating connected epidemics and emphasize the importance of collaborative interventions for pandemic prevention and mitigation.

Abstract: Summary
Acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) species are cofactors for numerous enzymes that acylate thousands of proteins. Here, we describe an enzyme that uses S-nitroso-CoA (SNO-CoA) as its cofactor to S-nitrosylate multiple proteins (SNO-CoA-assisted nitrosylase, SCAN). Separate domains in SCAN mediate SNO-CoA and substrate binding, allowing SCAN to selectively catalyze SNO transfer from SNO-CoA to SCAN to multiple protein targets, including the insulin receptor (INSR) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Insulin-stimulated S-nitrosylation of INSR/IRS1 by SCAN reduces insulin signaling physiologically, whereas increased SCAN activity in obesity causes INSR/IRS1 hypernitrosylation and insulin resistance. SCAN-deficient mice are thus protected from diabetes. In human skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, SCAN expression increases with body mass index and correlates with INSR S-nitrosylation. S-nitrosylation by SCAN/SNO-CoA thus defines a new enzyme class, a unique mode of receptor tyrosine kinase regulation, and a revised paradigm for NO function in physiology and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular lineage histories and their molecular states encode fundamental principles of tissue development and homeostasis. Current lineage-recording mouse models have insufficient barcode diversity and single-cell lineage coverage for profiling tissues composed of millions of cells. Here, we developed DARLIN, an inducible Cas9 barcoding mouse line that utilizes terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and 30 CRISPR target sites. DARLIN is inducible, generates massive lineage barcodes across tissues, and enables the detection of edited barcodes in ∼70% of profiled single cells. Using DARLIN, we examined fate bias within developing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and revealed unique features of HSC migration. Additionally, we established a protocol for joint transcriptomic and epigenomic single-cell measurements with DARLIN and found that cellular clonal memory is associated with genome-wide DNA methylation rather than gene expression or chromatin accessibility. DARLIN will enable the high-resolution study of lineage relationships and their molecular signatures in diverse tissues and physiological contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Regeneration across tissues and organs exhibits significant variation throughout the body and undergoes a progressive decline with age. To decode the relationships between aging and regenerative capacity, we conducted a comprehensive single-cell transcriptome analysis of regeneration in eight tissues from young and aged mice. We employed diverse analytical models to study tissue regeneration and unveiled the intricate cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the attenuated regenerative processes observed in aged tissues. Specifically, we identified compromised stem cell mobility and inadequate angiogenesis as prominent contributors to this age-associated decline in regenerative capacity. Moreover, we discovered a unique subset of Arg1+ macrophages that were activated in young tissues but suppressed in aged regenerating tissues, suggesting their important role in age-related immune response disparities during regeneration. This study provides a comprehensive single-cell resource for identifying potential targets for interventions aimed at enhancing regenerative outcomes in the aging population.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are abundant immune cells in the circulation and frequently infiltrate tumors in substantial numbers. However, their precise functions in different cancer types remain incompletely understood, including in the brain microenvironment. We therefore investigated neutrophils in tumor tissue of glioma and brain metastasis patients, with matched peripheral blood, and herein describe the first in-depth analysis of neutrophil phenotypes and functions in these tissues. Orthogonal profiling strategies in humans and mice revealed that brain tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) differ significantly from blood neutrophils and have a prolonged lifespan and immune-suppressive and pro-angiogenic capacity. TANs exhibit a distinct inflammatory signature, driven by a combination of soluble inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-ɑ) and Ceruloplasmin, which is more pronounced in TANs from brain metastasis versus glioma. Myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages, emerge at the core of this network of pro-inflammatory mediators, supporting the concept of a critical myeloid niche regulating overall immune suppression in human brain tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Naive human pluripotent stem cells have the remarkable ability to self-organize into blastocyst-like structures (“blastoids”) that model lineage segregation in the pre-implantation embryo. However, the extent to which blastoids can recapitulate the defining features of human post-implantation development remains unexplored. Here, we report that blastoids cultured on thick three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrices capture hallmarks of early post-implantation development, including epiblast lumenogenesis, rapid expansion and diversification of trophoblast lineages, and robust invasion of extravillous trophoblast cells by day 14. Extended blastoid culture results in the localized activation of primitive streak marker TBXT and the emergence of embryonic germ layers by day 21. We also show that the modulation of WNT signaling alters the balance between epiblast and trophoblast fates in post-implantation blastoids. This work demonstrates that 3D-cultured blastoids offer a continuous and integrated in vitro model system of human embryonic and extraembryonic development from pre-implantation to early gastrulation stages.

Pollen-pistil interactions establish interspecific/intergeneric pre-zygotic hybridization barriers in plants. The rejection of undesired pollen at the stigma is crucial to avoid outcrossing but can be overcome with the support of mentor pollen. The mechanisms underlying this hybridization barrier are largely unknown. Here, in Arabidopsis, we demonstrate that receptor-like kinases FERONIA/CURVY1/ANJEA/HERCULES RECEPTOR KINASE 1 and cell wall proteins LRX3/4/5 interact on papilla cell surfaces with autocrine stigmatic RALF1/22/23/33 peptide ligands (sRALFs) to establish a lock that blocks the penetration of undesired pollen tubes. Compatible pollen-derived RALF10/11/12/13/25/26/30 peptides (pRALFs) act as a key, outcompeting sRALFs and enabling pollen tube penetration. By treating Arabidopsis stigmas with synthetic pRALFs, we unlock the barrier, facilitating pollen tube penetration from distantly related Brassicaceae species and resulting in interspecific/intergeneric hybrid embryo formation. Therefore, we uncover a “lock-and-key” system governing the hybridization breadth of interspecific/intergeneric crosses in Brassicaceae. Manipulating this system holds promise for facilitating broad hybridization in crops.

Abstract: Summary
Germinal centers (GCs) form in lymph nodes after immunization or infection to facilitate antibody affinity maturation and memory and plasma cell (PC) development. PC differentiation is thought to involve stringent selection for GC B cells expressing the highest-affinity antigen receptors, but how this plays out during complex polyclonal responses is unclear. We combine temporal lineage tracing with antibody characterization to gain a snapshot of PCs developing during influenza infection. GCs co-mature B cell clones with antibody affinities spanning multiple orders of magnitude; however, each generates PCs with similar efficiencies, including weak binders. Within lineages, PC selection is not restricted to variants with the highest-affinity antibodies. Differentiation is commonly associated with proliferative expansion to produce “nodes” of identical PCs. Immunization-induced GCs generate fewer PCs but still of low- and high-antibody affinities. We propose that generating low-affinity antibody PCs reflects an evolutionary compromise to facilitate diverse serum antibody responses.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomes serve dual antagonistic functions in cells by mediating anabolic growth signaling and the catabolic turnover of macromolecules. How these janus-faced activities are regulated in response to cellular nutrient status is poorly understood. We show here that lysosome morphology and function are reversibly controlled by a nutrient-regulated signaling lipid switch that triggers the conversion between peripheral motile mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling-active and static mTORC1-inactive degradative lysosomes clustered at the cell center. Starvation-triggered relocalization of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P)-metabolizing enzymes reshapes the lysosomal surface proteome to facilitate lysosomal proteolysis and to repress mTORC1 signaling. Concomitantly, lysosomal phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), which marks motile signaling-active lysosomes in the cell periphery, is erased. Interference with this PI(3)P/PI(4)P lipid switch module impairs the adaptive response of cells to altering nutrient supply. Our data unravel a key function for lysosomal phosphoinositide metabolism in rewiring organellar membrane dynamics in response to cellular nutrient status.

Abstract: Summary
A generic level of chromatin organization generated by the interplay between cohesin and CTCF suffices to limit promiscuous interactions between regulatory elements, but a lineage-specific chromatin assembly that supersedes these constraints is required to configure the genome to guide gene expression changes that drive faithful lineage progression. Loss-of-function approaches in B cell precursors show that IKAROS assembles interactions across megabase distances in preparation for lymphoid development. Interactions emanating from IKAROS-bound enhancers override CTCF-imposed boundaries to assemble lineage-specific regulatory units built on a backbone of smaller invariant topological domains. Gain of function in epithelial cells confirms IKAROS’ ability to reconfigure chromatin architecture at multiple scales. Although the compaction of the Igκ locus required for genome editing represents a function of IKAROS unique to lymphocytes, the more general function to preconfigure the genome to support lineage-specific gene expression and suppress activation of extra-lineage genes provides a paradigm for lineage restriction.

Abstract: Summary
Human reasoning depends on reusing pieces of information by putting them together in new ways. However, very little is known about how compositional computation is implemented in the brain. Here, we ask participants to solve a series of problems that each require constructing a whole from a set of elements. With fMRI, we find that representations of novel constructed objects in the frontal cortex and hippocampus are relational and compositional. With MEG, we find that replay assembles elements into compounds, with each replay sequence constituting a hypothesis about a possible configuration of elements. The content of sequences evolves as participants solve each puzzle, progressing from predictable to uncertain elements and gradually converging on the correct configuration. Together, these results suggest a computational bridge between apparently distinct functions of hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry and a role for generative replay in compositional inference and hypothesis testing.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cells regulate their self-renewal and differentiation fate outcomes through both symmetric and asymmetric divisions. m6A RNA methylation controls symmetric commitment and inflammation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through unknown mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the nuclear speckle protein SON is an essential m6A target required for murine HSC self-renewal, symmetric commitment, and inflammation control. Global profiling of m6A identified that m6A mRNA methylation of Son increases during HSC commitment. Upon m6A depletion, Son mRNA increases, but its protein is depleted. Reintroduction of SON rescues defects in HSC symmetric commitment divisions and engraftment. Conversely, Son deletion results in a loss of HSC fitness, while overexpression of SON improves mouse and human HSC engraftment potential by increasing quiescence. Mechanistically, we found that SON rescues MYC and suppresses the METTL3-HSC inflammatory gene expression program, including CCL5, through transcriptional regulation. Thus, our findings define a m6A-SON-CCL5 axis that controls inflammation and HSC fate.

Abstract: Summary
Cannabis activates the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), which elicits analgesic and emotion regulation benefits, along with adverse effects, via Gi and β-arrestin signaling pathways. However, the lack of understanding of the mechanism of β-arrestin-1 (βarr1) coupling and signaling bias has hindered drug development targeting CB1. Here, we present the high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of CB1-βarr1 complex bound to the synthetic cannabinoid MDMB-Fubinaca (FUB), revealing notable differences in the transducer pocket and ligand-binding site compared with the Gi protein complex. βarr1 occupies a wider transducer pocket promoting substantial outward movement of the TM6 and distinctive twin toggle switch rearrangements, whereas FUB adopts a different pose, inserting more deeply than the Gi-coupled state, suggesting the allosteric correlation between the orthosteric binding pocket and the partner protein site. Taken together, our findings unravel the molecular mechanism of signaling bias toward CB1, facilitating the development of CB1 agonists.

Abstract: Summary
Cav1.2 channels play crucial roles in various neuronal and physiological processes. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of human Cav1.2, both in its apo form and in complex with several drugs, as well as the peptide neurotoxin calciseptine. Most structures, apo or bound to calciseptine, amlodipine, or a combination of amiodarone and sofosbuvir, exhibit a consistent inactivated conformation with a sealed gate, three up voltage-sensing domains (VSDs), and a down VSDII. Calciseptine sits on the shoulder of the pore domain, away from the permeation path. In contrast, when pinaverium bromide, an antispasmodic drug, is inserted into a cavity reminiscent of the IFM-binding site in Nav channels, a series of structural changes occur, including upward movement of VSDII coupled with dilation of the selectivity filter and its surrounding segments in repeat III. Meanwhile, S4-5III merges with S5III to become a single helix, resulting in a widened but still non-conductive intracellular gate.

Abstract: Summary
Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a highly heritable mental disorder with thousands of associated genetic variants located mostly in the noncoding space of the genome. Translating these associations into insights regarding the underlying pathomechanisms has been challenging because the causal variants, their mechanisms of action, and their target genes remain largely unknown. We implemented a massively parallel variant annotation pipeline (MVAP) to perform SCZ variant-to-function mapping at scale in disease-relevant neural cell types. This approach identified 620 functional variants (1.7%) that operate in a highly developmental context and neuronal-activity-dependent manner. Multimodal integration of epigenomic and CRISPRi screening data enabled us to link these functional variants to target genes, biological processes, and ultimately alterations of neuronal physiology. These results provide a multistage prioritization strategy to map functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-to-gene-to-endophenotype relations and offer biological insights into the context-dependent molecular processes modulated by SCZ-associated genetic variation.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular signals interact in networks to mediate biological processes. To analyze these networks, it would be useful to image many signals at once, in the same living cell, using standard microscopes and genetically encoded fluorescent reporters. Here, we report temporally multiplexed imaging (TMI), which uses genetically encoded fluorescent proteins with different clocklike properties—such as reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins with different switching kinetics—to represent different cellular signals. We linearly decompose a brief (few-second-long) trace of the fluorescence fluctuations, at each point in a cell, into a weighted sum of the traces exhibited by each fluorophore expressed in the cell. The weights then represent the signal amplitudes. We use TMI to analyze relationships between different kinase activities in individual cells, as well as between different cell-cycle signals, pointing toward broad utility throughout biology in the analysis of signal transduction cascades in living systems.

Abstract: Summary
The dynamics of immunity to infection in infants remain obscure. Here, we used a multi-omics approach to perform a longitudinal analysis of immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in infants and young children by analyzing blood samples and weekly nasal swabs collected before, during, and after infection with Omicron and non-Omicron variants. Infection stimulated robust antibody titers that, unlike in adults, showed no sign of decay for up to 300 days. Infants mounted a robust mucosal immune response characterized by inflammatory cytokines, interferon (IFN) α, and T helper (Th) 17 and neutrophil markers (interleukin [IL]-17, IL-8, and CXCL1). The immune response in blood was characterized by upregulation of activation markers on innate cells, no inflammatory cytokines, but several chemokines and IFNα. The latter correlated with viral load and expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in myeloid cells measured by single-cell multi-omics. Together, these data provide a snapshot of immunity to infection during the initial weeks and months of life.

Abstract: Summary
The gut epithelium has a remarkable ability to recover from damage. We employed a combination of high-throughput sequencing approaches, mouse genetics, and murine and human organoids and identified a role for TGFB signaling during intestinal regeneration following injury. At 2 days following irradiation (IR)-induced damage of intestinal crypts, a surge in TGFB1 expression is mediated by monocyte/macrophage cells at the location of damage. The depletion of macrophages or genetic disruption of TGFB signaling significantly impaired the regenerative response. Intestinal regeneration is characterized by the induction of a fetal-like transcriptional signature during repair. In organoid culture, TGFB1 treatment was necessary and sufficient to induce the fetal-like/regenerative state. Mesenchymal cells were also responsive to TGFB1 and enhanced the regenerative response. Mechanistically, pro-regenerative factors, YAP/TEAD and SOX9, are activated in the epithelium exposed to TGFB1. Finally, pre-treatment with TGFB1 enhanced the ability of primary epithelial cultures to engraft into damaged murine colon, suggesting promise for cellular therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic stimulation can cause T cell dysfunction and limit the efficacy of cellular immunotherapies. Improved methods are required to compare large numbers of synthetic knockin (KI) sequences to reprogram cell functions. Here, we developed modular pooled KI screening (ModPoKI), an adaptable platform for modular construction of DNA KI libraries using barcoded multicistronic adaptors. We built two ModPoKI libraries of 100 transcription factors (TFs) and 129 natural and synthetic surface receptors (SRs). Over 30 ModPoKI screens across human TCR- and CAR-T cells in diverse conditions identified a transcription factor AP4 (TFAP4) construct that enhanced fitness of chronically stimulated CAR-T cells and anti-cancer function in vitro and in vivo. ModPoKI’s modularity allowed us to generate an ∼10,000-member library of TF combinations. Non-viral KI of a combined BATF-TFAP4 polycistronic construct enhanced fitness. Overexpressed BATF and TFAP4 co-occupy and regulate key gene targets to reprogram T cell function. ModPoKI facilitates the discovery of complex gene constructs to program cellular functions.

Abstract: Summary
Harmonizing cell types across the single-cell community and assembling them into a common framework is central to building a standardized Human Cell Atlas. Here, we present CellHint, a predictive clustering tree-based tool to resolve cell-type differences in annotation resolution and technical biases across datasets. CellHint accurately quantifies cell-cell transcriptomic similarities and places cell types into a relationship graph that hierarchically defines shared and unique cell subtypes. Application to multiple immune datasets recapitulates expert-curated annotations. CellHint also reveals underexplored relationships between healthy and diseased lung cell states in eight diseases. Furthermore, we present a workflow for fast cross-dataset integration guided by harmonized cell types and cell hierarchy, which uncovers underappreciated cell types in adult human hippocampus. Finally, we apply CellHint to 12 tissues from 38 datasets, providing a deeply curated cross-tissue database with ∼3.7 million cells and various machine learning models for automatic cell annotation across human tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular perception of auxin, an essential phytohormone in plants, has been debated for decades. Auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1) physically interacts with quintessential transmembrane kinases (TMKs) and was proposed to act as an extracellular auxin receptor, but its role was disputed because abp1 knockout mutants lack obvious morphological phenotypes. Here, we identified two new auxin-binding proteins, ABL1 and ABL2, that are localized to the apoplast and directly interact with the extracellular domain of TMKs in an auxin-dependent manner. Furthermore, functionally redundant ABL1 and ABL2 genetically interact with TMKs and exhibit functions that overlap with those of ABP1 as well as being independent of ABP1. Importantly, the extracellular domain of TMK1 itself binds auxin and synergizes with either ABP1 or ABL1 in auxin binding. Thus, our findings discovered auxin receptors ABL1 and ABL2 having functions overlapping with but distinct from ABP1 and acting together with TMKs as co-receptors for extracellular auxin.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cultured axenically without detergent forms biofilm-like cords, a clinical identifier of virulence. In lung-on-chip (LoC) and mouse models, cords in alveolar cells contribute to suppression of innate immune signaling via nuclear compression. Thereafter, extracellular cords cause contact-dependent phagocyte death but grow intercellularly between epithelial cells. The absence of these mechanopathological mechanisms explains the greater proportion of alveolar lesions with increased immune infiltration and dissemination defects in cording-deficient Mtb infections. Compression of Mtb lipid monolayers induces a phase transition that enables mechanical energy storage. Agent-based simulations demonstrate that the increased energy storage capacity is sufficient for the formation of cords that maintain structural integrity despite mechanical perturbation. Bacteria in cords remain translationally active despite antibiotic exposure and regrow rapidly upon cessation of treatment. This study provides a conceptual framework for the biophysics and function in tuberculosis infection and therapy of cord architectures independent of mechanisms ascribed to single bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic mutations accumulate in all cells with age and can confer a selective advantage, leading to clonal expansion over time. In hematopoietic cells, mutations in a subset of genes regulating DNA repair or epigenetics frequently lead to clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Here, we describe the context and mechanisms that lead to enrichment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with mutations in SRCAP, which encodes a chromatin remodeler that also influences DNA repair. We show that SRCAP mutations confer a selective advantage in human cells and in mice upon treatment with the anthracycline-class chemotherapeutic doxorubicin and bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, Srcap mutations lead to a lymphoid-biased expansion, driven by loss of SRCAP-regulated H2A.Z deposition and increased DNA repair. Altogether, we demonstrate that SRCAP operates at the intersection of multiple pathways in stem and progenitor cells, offering a new perspective on the functional impact of genetic variants that promote stem cell competition in the hematopoietic system.

Abstract: Summary
The hedonic value of salt fundamentally changes depending on the internal state. High concentrations of salt induce innate aversion under sated states, whereas such aversive stimuli transform into appetitive ones under sodium depletion. Neural mechanisms underlying this state-dependent salt valence switch are poorly understood. Using transcriptomics state-to-cell-type mapping and neural manipulations, we show that positive and negative valences of salt are controlled by anatomically distinct neural circuits in the mammalian brain. The hindbrain interoceptive circuit regulates sodium-specific appetitive drive , whereas behavioral tolerance of aversive salts is encoded by a dedicated class of neurons in the forebrain lamina terminalis (LT) expressing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor, Ptger3. We show that these LT neurons regulate salt tolerance by selectively modulating aversive taste sensitivity, partly through a PGE2-Ptger3 axis. These results reveal the bimodal regulation of appetitive and tolerance signals toward salt, which together dictate the amount of sodium consumption under different internal states.

Abstract: Summary
The complement system is a critical part of our innate immune response, and the terminal products of this cascade, anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, exert their physiological and pathophysiological responses primarily via two GPCRs, C3aR and C5aR1. However, the molecular mechanism of ligand recognition, activation, and signaling bias of these receptors remains mostly elusive. Here, we present nine cryo-EM structures of C3aR and C5aR1 activated by their natural and synthetic agonists, which reveal distinct binding pocket topologies of complement anaphylatoxins and provide key insights into receptor activation and transducer coupling. We also uncover the structural basis of a naturally occurring mechanism to dampen the inflammatory response of C5a via proteolytic cleavage of the terminal arginine and the G-protein signaling bias elicited by a peptide agonist of C3aR identified here. In summary, our study elucidates the innerworkings of the complement anaphylatoxin receptors and should facilitate structure-guided drug discovery to target these receptors in a spectrum of disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The CD1 system binds lipid antigens for display to T cells. Here, we solved lipidomes for the four human CD1 antigen-presenting molecules, providing a map of self-lipid display. Answering a basic question, the detection of >2,000 CD1-lipid complexes demonstrates broad presentation of self-sphingolipids and phospholipids. Whereas peptide antigens are chemically processed, many lipids are presented in an unaltered form. However, each type of CD1 protein differentially edits the self-lipidome to show distinct capture motifs based on lipid length and chemical composition, suggesting general antigen display mechanisms. For CD1a and CD1d, lipid size matches the CD1 cleft volume. CD1c cleft size is more variable, and CD1b is the outlier, where ligands and clefts show an extreme size mismatch that is explained by uniformly seating two small lipids in one cleft. Furthermore, the list of compounds that comprise the integrated CD1 lipidome supports the ongoing discovery of lipid blockers and antigens for T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) senses a spectrum of endogenous amine-containing metabolites (EAMs) to mediate diverse psychological functions and is useful for schizophrenia treatment without the side effects of catalepsy. Here, we systematically profiled the signaling properties of TAAR1 activation and present nine structures of TAAR1-Gs/Gq in complex with EAMs, clinical drugs, and synthetic compounds. These structures not only revealed the primary amine recognition pocket (PARP) harboring the conserved acidic D3.32 for conserved amine recognition and “twin” toggle switch for receptor activation but also elucidated that targeting specific residues in the second binding pocket (SBP) allowed modulation of signaling preference. In addition to traditional drug-induced Gs signaling, Gq activation by EAM or synthetic compounds is beneficial to schizophrenia treatment. Our results provided a structural and signaling framework for molecular recognition by TAAR1, which afforded structural templates and signal clues for TAAR1-targeted candidate compounds design.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder. Its symptoms are typically treated with levodopa or dopamine receptor agonists, but its action lacks specificity due to the wide distribution of dopamine receptors in the central nervous system and periphery. Here, we report the development of a gene therapy strategy to selectively manipulate PD-affected circuitry. Targeting striatal D1 medium spiny neurons (MSNs), whose activity is chronically suppressed in PD, we engineered a therapeutic strategy comprised of a highly efficient retrograde adeno-associated virus (AAV), promoter elements with strong D1-MSN activity, and a chemogenetic effector to enable precise D1-MSN activation after systemic ligand administration. Application of this therapeutic approach rescues locomotion, tremor, and motor skill defects in both mouse and primate models of PD, supporting the feasibility of targeted circuit modulation tools for the treatment of PD in humans.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing has enabled advanced T cell therapies, but occasional loss of the targeted chromosome remains a safety concern. To investigate whether Cas9-induced chromosome loss is a universal phenomenon and evaluate its clinical significance, we conducted a systematic analysis in primary human T cells. Arrayed and pooled CRISPR screens revealed that chromosome loss was generalizable across the genome and resulted in partial and entire loss of the targeted chromosome, including in preclinical chimeric antigen receptor T cells. T cells with chromosome loss persisted for weeks in culture, implying the potential to interfere with clinical use. A modified cell manufacturing process, employed in our first-in-human clinical trial of Cas9-engineered T cells (NCT03399448), reduced chromosome loss while largely preserving genome editing efficacy. Expression of p53 correlated with protection from chromosome loss observed in this protocol, suggesting both a mechanism and strategy for T cell engineering that mitigates this genotoxicity in the clinic.

Abstract: Summary
Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC, “Long COVID”) pose a significant global health challenge. The pathophysiology is unknown, and no effective treatments have been found to date. Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain the etiology of PASC, including viral persistence, chronic inflammation, hypercoagulability, and autonomic dysfunction. Here, we propose a mechanism that links all four hypotheses in a single pathway and provides actionable insights for therapeutic interventions. We find that PASC are associated with serotonin reduction. Viral infection and type I interferon-driven inflammation reduce serotonin through three mechanisms: diminished intestinal absorption of the serotonin precursor tryptophan; platelet hyperactivation and thrombocytopenia, which impacts serotonin storage; and enhanced MAO-mediated serotonin turnover. Peripheral serotonin reduction, in turn, impedes the activity of the vagus nerve and thereby impairs hippocampal responses and memory. These findings provide a possible explanation for neurocognitive symptoms associated with viral persistence in Long COVID, which may extend to other post-viral syndromes.

Abstract: Summary
SpCas9 and AsCas12a are widely utilized as genome-editing tools in human cells. However, their relatively large size poses a limitation for delivery by cargo-size-limited adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. The type V-F Cas12f from Acidibacillus sulfuroxidans is exceptionally compact (422 amino acids) and has been harnessed as a compact genome-editing tool. Here, we developed an approach, combining deep mutational scanning and structure-informed design, to successfully generate two AsCas12f activity-enhanced (enAsCas12f) variants. Remarkably, the enAsCas12f variants exhibited genome-editing activities in human cells comparable with those of SpCas9 and AsCas12a. The cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures revealed that the mutations stabilize the dimer formation and reinforce interactions with nucleic acids to enhance their DNA cleavage activities. Moreover, enAsCas12f packaged with partner genes in an all-in-one AAV vector exhibited efficient knock-in/knock-out activities and transcriptional activation in mice. Taken together, enAsCas12f variants could offer a minimal genome-editing platform for in vivo gene therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Today’s genomics workflows typically require alignment to a reference sequence, which limits discovery. We introduce a unifying paradigm, SPLASH (Statistically Primary aLignment Agnostic Sequence Homing), which directly analyzes raw sequencing data, using a statistical test to detect a signature of regulation: sample-specific sequence variation. SPLASH detects many types of variation and can be efficiently run at scale. We show that SPLASH identifies complex mutation patterns in SARS-CoV-2, discovers regulated RNA isoforms at the single-cell level, detects the vast sequence diversity of adaptive immune receptors, and uncovers biology in non-model organisms undocumented in their reference genomes: geographic and seasonal variation and diatom association in eelgrass, an oceanic plant impacted by climate change, and tissue-specific transcripts in octopus. SPLASH is a unifying approach to genomic analysis that enables expansive discovery without metadata or references.

Abstract: Summary
Photosynthesis is central to food production and the Earth’s biogeochemistry, yet the molecular basis for its regulation remains poorly understood. Here, using high-throughput genetics in the model eukaryotic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we identify with high confidence (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.11) 70 poorly characterized genes required for photosynthesis. We then enable the functional characterization of these genes by providing a resource of proteomes of mutant strains, each lacking one of these genes. The data allow assignment of 34 genes to the biogenesis or regulation of one or more specific photosynthetic complexes. Further analysis uncovers biogenesis/regulatory roles for at least seven proteins, including five photosystem I mRNA maturation factors, the chloroplast translation factor MTF1, and the master regulator PMR1, which regulates chloroplast genes via nuclear-expressed factors. Our work provides a rich resource identifying regulatory and functional genes and placing them into pathways, thereby opening the door to a system-level understanding of photosynthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Endometrial decidualization connecting embryo implantation and placentation is transient but essential for successful pregnancy, which, however, is not systematically investigated. Here, we use a scStereo-seq technology to spatially visualize and define the dynamic functional decidual hubs assembled by distinct immune, endothelial, trophoblast, and decidual stromal cells (DSCs) in early pregnant mice. We unravel the DSC transdifferentiation trajectory and surprisingly discover a dual-featured type of immune-featured DSCs (iDSCs). We find that immature DSCs attract immune cells and induce decidual angiogenesis at the mesenchymal-epithelial transition hub during decidualization initiation. iDSCs enable immune cell recruitment and suppression, govern vascularization, and promote cytolysis at immune cell assembling and vascular hubs, respectively, to establish decidual homeostasis at a later stage. Interestingly, dysfunctional and spatially disordered iDSCs cause abnormal accumulation of immune cells in the vascular hub, which disrupts decidual hub specification and eventually leads to pregnancy complications in DBA/2-mated CBA/J mice.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt proteins are enzymatically lipidated by Porcupine (PORCN) in the ER and bind to Wntless (WLS) for intracellular transport and secretion. Mechanisms governing the transfer of these low-solubility Wnts from the ER to the extracellular space remain unclear. Through structural and functional analyses of Wnt7a, a crucial Wnt involved in central nervous system angiogenesis and blood-brain barrier maintenance, we have elucidated the principles of Wnt biogenesis and Wnt7-specific signaling. The Wnt7a-WLS complex binds to calreticulin (CALR), revealing that CALR functions as a chaperone to facilitate Wnt transfer from PORCN to WLS during Wnt biogenesis. Our structures, functional analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that a phospholipid in the core of Wnt-bound WLS regulates the association and dissociation between Wnt and WLS, suggesting a lipid-mediated Wnt secretion mechanism. Finally, the structure of Wnt7a bound to RECK, a cell-surface Wnt7 co-receptor, reveals how RECKCC4 engages the N-terminal domain of Wnt7a to activate Wnt7-specific signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Embryogenesis necessitates harmonious coordination between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Although stem cells of both embryonic and extraembryonic origins have been generated, they are grown in different culture conditions. In this study, utilizing a unified culture condition that activates the FGF, TGF-β, and WNT pathways, we have successfully derived embryonic stem cells (FTW-ESCs), extraembryonic endoderm stem cells (FTW-XENs), and trophoblast stem cells (FTW-TSCs) from the three foundational tissues of mouse and cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) blastocysts. This approach facilitates the co-culture of embryonic and extraembryonic stem cells, revealing a growth inhibition effect exerted by extraembryonic endoderm cells on pluripotent cells, partially through extracellular matrix signaling. Additionally, our cross-species analysis identified both shared and unique transcription factors and pathways regulating FTW-XENs. The embryonic and extraembryonic stem cell co-culture strategy offers promising avenues for developing more faithful embryo models and devising more developmentally pertinent differentiation protocols.

Abstract: Summary
A formal demonstration that mammalian pluripotent stem cells possess preimplantation embryonic cell-like (naive) pluripotency is the generation of chimeric animals through early embryo complementation with homologous cells. Whereas such naive pluripotency has been well demonstrated in rodents, poor chimerism has been achieved in other species including non-human primates due to the inability of the donor cells to match the developmental state of the host embryos. Here, we have systematically tested various culture conditions for establishing monkey naive embryonic stem cells and optimized the procedures for chimeric embryo culture. This approach generated an aborted fetus and a live chimeric monkey with high donor cell contribution. A stringent characterization pipeline demonstrated that donor cells efficiently (up to 90%) incorporated into various tissues (including the gonads and placenta) of the chimeric monkeys. Our results have major implications for the study of primate naive pluripotency and genetic engineering of non-human primates.

Abstract: Summary
Gravity controls directional growth of plants, and the classical starch-statolith hypothesis proposed more than a century ago postulates that amyloplast sedimentation in specialized cells initiates gravity sensing, but the molecular mechanism remains uncharacterized. The LAZY proteins are known as key regulators of gravitropism, and lazy mutants show striking gravitropic defects. Here, we report that gravistimulation by reorientation triggers mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling-mediated phosphorylation of Arabidopsis LAZY proteins basally polarized in root columella cells. Phosphorylation of LAZY increases its interaction with several translocons at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts (TOC) proteins on the surface of amyloplasts, facilitating enrichment of LAZY proteins on amyloplasts. Amyloplast sedimentation subsequently guides LAZY to relocate to the new lower side of the plasma membrane in columella cells, where LAZY induces asymmetrical auxin distribution and root differential growth. Together, this study provides a molecular interpretation for the starch-statolith hypothesis: the organelle-movement-triggered molecular polarity formation.

Abstract: Summary
Progenitor cells are critical in preserving organismal homeostasis, yet their diversity and dynamics in the aged brain remain underexplored. We introduced TrackerSci, a single-cell genomic method that combines newborn cell labeling and combinatorial indexing to characterize the transcriptome and chromatin landscape of proliferating progenitor cells in vivo. Using TrackerSci, we investigated the dynamics of newborn cells in mouse brains across various ages and in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Our dataset revealed diverse progenitor cell types in the brain and their epigenetic signatures. We further quantified aging-associated shifts in cell-type-specific proliferation and differentiation and deciphered the associated molecular programs. Extending our study to the progenitor cells in the aged human brain, we identified conserved genetic signatures across species and pinpointed region-specific cellular dynamics, such as the reduced oligodendrogenesis in the cerebellum. We anticipate that TrackerSci will be broadly applicable to unveil cell-type-specific temporal dynamics in diverse systems.

Abstract: Summary
The mpox outbreak of 2022–2023 involved rapid global spread in men who have sex with men. We infected 18 rhesus macaques with mpox by the intravenous, intradermal, and intrarectal routes and observed robust antibody and T cell responses following all three routes of infection. Numerous skin lesions and high plasma viral loads were observed following intravenous and intradermal infection. Skin lesions peaked on day 10 and resolved by day 28 following infection. On day 28, we re-challenged all convalescent and 3 naive animals with mpox. All convalescent animals were protected against re-challenge. Transcriptomic studies showed upregulation of innate and inflammatory responses and downregulation of collagen formation and extracellular matrix organization following challenge, as well as rapid activation of T cell and plasma cell responses following re-challenge. These data suggest key mechanistic insights into mpox pathogenesis and immunity. This macaque model should prove useful for evaluating mpox vaccines and therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that causes pain, degradation, and dysfunction. Excessive canonical Wnt signaling in osteoarthritis contributes to chondrocyte phenotypic instability and loss of cartilage homeostasis; however, the regulatory niche is unknown. Using the temporomandibular joint as a model in multiple species, we identify Lgr5-expressing secretory cells as forming a Wnt inhibitory niche that instruct Wnt-inactive chondroprogenitors to form the nascent synovial joint and regulate chondrocyte lineage and identity. Lgr5 ablation or suppression during joint development, aging, or osteoarthritis results in depletion of Wnt-inactive chondroprogenitors and a surge of Wnt-activated, phenotypically unstable chondrocytes with osteoblast-like properties. We recapitulate the cartilage niche and create StemJEL, an injectable hydrogel therapy combining hyaluronic acid and sclerostin. Local delivery of StemJEL to post-traumatic osteoarthritic jaw and knee joints in rabbit, rat, and mini-pig models restores cartilage homeostasis, chondrocyte identity, and joint function. We provide proof of principal that StemJEL preserves the chondrocyte niche and alleviates osteoarthritis.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental feature of cellular growth is that total protein and RNA amounts increase with cell size to keep concentrations approximately constant. A key component of this is that global transcription rates increase in larger cells. Here, we identify RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) as the limiting factor scaling mRNA transcription with cell size in budding yeast, as transcription is highly sensitive to the dosage of RNAPII but not to other components of the transcriptional machinery. Our experiments support a dynamic equilibrium model where global RNAPII transcription at a given size is set by the mass action recruitment kinetics of unengaged nucleoplasmic RNAPII to the genome. However, this only drives a sub-linear increase in transcription with size, which is then partially compensated for by a decrease in mRNA decay rates as cells enlarge. Thus, limiting RNAPII and feedback on mRNA stability work in concert to scale mRNA amounts with cell size.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 primary strain-based vaccination exerts a protective effect against Omicron variants-initiated infection, symptom occurrence, and disease severity in a booster-dependent manner. Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. During the 2022 Omicron outbreak in Shanghai, we enrolled 122 infected adults and 50 uninfected controls who had been unvaccinated or vaccinated with two or three doses of COVID-19 inactive vaccines and performed integrative analysis of 41-plex CyTOF, RNA-seq, and Olink on their peripheral blood samples. The frequencies of HLA-DRhi classical monocytes, non-classical monocytes, and Th1-like Tem tended to increase, whereas the frequency of Treg was reduced by booster vaccine, and they influenced symptom occurrence in a vaccine dose-dependent manner. Intercorrelation and mechanistic analysis suggested that the booster vaccination induced monocytic training, which would prime monocytic activation and maturation rather than differentiating into myeloid-derived suppressive cells upon Omicron infections. Overall, our study provides insights into how booster vaccination elaborates protective immunity across SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Abstract: Summary
Our understanding of the molecular basis for cellular senescence remains incomplete, limiting the development of strategies to ameliorate age-related pathologies by preventing stem cell senescence. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screening using a human mesenchymal precursor cell (hMPC) model of the progeroid syndrome. We evaluated targets whose activation antagonizes cellular senescence, among which SOX5 outperformed as a top hit. Through decoding the epigenomic landscapes remodeled by overexpressing SOX5, we uncovered its role in resetting the transcription network for geroprotective genes, including HMGB2. Mechanistically, SOX5 binding elevated the enhancer activity of HMGB2 with increased levels of H3K27ac and H3K4me1, raising HMGB2 expression so as to promote rejuvenation. Furthermore, gene therapy with lentiviruses carrying SOX5 or HMGB2 rejuvenated cartilage and alleviated osteoarthritis in aged mice. Our study generated a comprehensive list of rejuvenators, pinpointing SOX5 as a potent driver for rejuvenation both in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of viral RNA biogenesis is fundamental to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection. To characterize host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) involved in this process, we biochemically identified proteins bound to genomic and subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. We find that the host protein SND1 binds the 5′ end of negative-sense viral RNA and is required for SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. SND1-depleted cells form smaller replication organelles and display diminished virus growth kinetics. We discover that NSP9, a viral RBP and direct SND1 interaction partner, is covalently linked to the 5′ ends of positive- and negative-sense RNAs produced during infection. These linkages occur at replication-transcription initiation sites, consistent with NSP9 priming viral RNA synthesis. Mechanistically, SND1 remodels NSP9 occupancy and alters the covalent linkage of NSP9 to initiating nucleotides in viral RNA. Our findings implicate NSP9 in the initiation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis and unravel an unsuspected role of a cellular protein in orchestrating viral RNA production.
