Abstract: Graminaceous plants release ferric-chelating phytosiderophores that bind to iron. These ferric-phytosiderophore complexes are transported across the plasma membrane by a protein produced from Yellow Stripe 1 (YS1). Here, we report the characterization of OsYSL16, one of the YS1-like genes in rice. Real-time analysis revealed that this gene was constitutively expressed irrespective of metal status. Promoter fusions of OsYSL16 to {¡-glucuronidase (GUS) showed that OsYSL16 was highly expressed in the vascular tissues of the root, leaf, and spikelet, and in leaf mesophyll cells. The OsYSL16-green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane. From a pool of rice T-DNA insertional lines, we identified two independent activation-tagging mutants in OsYSL16. On an Fe-deficient medium, those mutants retained relatively high chlorophyll concentrations compared with the wild-type (WT) controls, indicating that they are more tolerant to a lack of iron. The Fe concentration in shoots was also higher in the OsYSL16 activation lines than in the WT. During germination, the rate of Fe-utilization from the seeds was higher in the OsYSL16 activation lines than in the WT seeds. Our results suggest that the function of OsYSL16 in Fe-homeostasis is to enable distribution of iron within a plant.

Abstract: Summary
Caspase 1 is part of the inflammasome, which is assembled upon pathogen recognition, while caspases 3 and/or 7 are mediators of apoptotic and nonapoptotic functions. PARP1 cleavage is a hallmark of apoptosis yet not essential, suggesting it has another physiological role. Here we show that after LPS stimulation, caspase 7 is activated by caspase 1, translocates to the nucleus, and cleaves PARP1 at the promoters of a subset of NF-κB target genes negatively regulated by PARP1. Mutating the PARP1 cleavage site D214 renders PARP1 uncleavable and inhibits PARP1 release from chromatin and chromatin decondensation, thereby restraining the expression of cleavage-dependent NF-κB target genes. These findings propose an apoptosis-independent regulatory role for caspase 7-mediated PARP1 cleavage in proinflammatory gene expression and provide insight into inflammasome signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Polarized delivery of signaling and adhesion molecules to the leading edge is required for directional migration of cells. Here, we describe a role for the PIP2-synthesizing enzyme, PIPKIγi2, in regulation of exocyst complex control of cell polarity and polarized integrin trafficking during migration. Loss of PIPKIγi2 impaired directional migration, formation of cell polarity, and integrin trafficking to the leading edge. Upon initiation of directional migration, PIPKIγi2 via PIP2 generation controls the integration of the exocyst complex into an integrin-containing trafficking compartment that requires the talin-binding ability of PIPKIγi2, and talin for integrin recruitment to the leading edge. A PIP2 requirement is further emphasized by inhibition of PIPKIγi2-regulated directional migration by an Exo70 mutant deficient in PIP2 binding. These results reveal how phosphoinositide generation orchestrates polarized trafficking of integrin in coordination with talin that links integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, processes that are required for directional migration.

Abstract: Summary
Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) is a glycolysis enzyme catalyzing conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate by transferring a phosphate from PEP to ADP. We report here that PKM2 localizes to the cell nucleus. The levels of nuclear PKM2 correlate with cell proliferation. PKM2 activates transcription of MEK5 by phosphorylating stat3 at Y705. In vitro phosphorylation assays show that PKM2 is a protein kinase using PEP as a phosphate donor. ADP competes with the protein substrate binding, indicating that the substrate may bind to the ADP site of PKM2. Our experiments suggest that PKM2 dimer is an active protein kinase, while the tetramer is an active pyruvate kinase. Expression of a PKM2 mutant that exists as a dimer promotes cell proliferation, indicating that protein kinase activity of PKM2 plays a role in promoting cell proliferation. Our study reveals an important link between metabolism alteration and gene expression during tumor transformation and progression.

Abstract: In field conditions, the zebra2 (z2) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa) produces leaves with transverse pale-green/yellow stripes. It was recently reported that ZEBRA2 encodes carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO) and that low levels of lutein, an essential carotenoid for non-photochemical quenching, cause leaf variegation in z2 mutants. However, we found that the z2 mutant phenotype was completely suppressed by growth under continuous light (CL; permissive) conditions, with concentrations of chlorophyll, carotenoids and chloroplast proteins at normal levels in z2 mutants under CL. In addition, three types of reactive oxygen species (ROS; superoxide [O2]), hydrogen peroxide [H2O2], and singlet oxygen [1O2]) accumulated to high levels in z2 mutants grown under short-day conditions (SD; alternate 10-h light/14-h dark; restrictive), but do not accumulate under CL conditions. However, the levels of lutein and zeaxanthin in z2 leaves were much lower than normal in both permissive CL and restrictive SD growth conditions, indicating that deficiency of these two carotenoids is not responsible for the leaf variegation phenotype. We found that the CRTISO substrate tetra-cis-lycopene accumulated during the dark periods under SD, but not under CL conditions. Its accumulation was also positively correlated with 1O2 levels generated during the light period, which consequently altered the expression of 1O2-responsive and cell death-related genes in the variegated z2 leaves. Taking these results together, we propose that the z2 leaf variegation can be largely attributed to photoperiodic accumulation of tetra-cis-lycopene and generation of excessive 1O2 under natural day-night conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular response to DNA damage employs multiple dynamic protein modifications to exert rapid and adaptable effects. Substantial work has detailed the roles of canonical checkpoint-mediated phosphorylation in this program. Recent studies have also implicated sumoylation in the DNA damage response; however, a systematic view of the contribution of sumoylation to replication and repair and its interplay with checkpoints is lacking. Here, using a biochemical screen in yeast, we establish that DNA damage-induced sumoylation occurs on a large scale. We identify MRX (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2) as a positive regulator of this induction for a subset of repair targets. In addition, we find that defective sumoylation results in failure to complete replication of a damaged genome and impaired DNA end processing, highlighting the importance of the SUMO-mediated response in genome integrity. We also show that DNA damage-induced sumoylation does not require Mec1 checkpoint signaling, and the presence of both enables optimal DNA damage resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Antiviral proteins that recognize pathogen-specific or aberrantly located molecular motifs are perfectly positioned to act as pattern-recognition receptors and signal to the immune system. Here we investigated whether the interferon-induced viral restriction factor tetherin (CD317/BST2), which is known to inhibit HIV-1 particle release by physically tethering virions to the cell surface, has such a signaling role. We find that upon restriction of Vpu-defective HIV-1, tetherin acts as a virus sensor to induce NFκB-dependent proinflammatory gene expression. Signaling requires both tetherin’s extracellular domain involved in virion retention and determinants in the cytoplasmic tail, including an endocytic motif, although signaling is independent of virion endocytosis. Furthermore, recruitment of the TNF-receptor-associated factor TRAF6 and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase TAK1 are critical for signaling. Human tetherin’s ability to mediate efficient signaling may have arisen as a result of a five amino acid deletion that occurred in hominids after their divergence from chimpanzees.

Abstract: Summary
Innate immune responses are characterized by precise gene expression whereby gene subsets are temporally induced to limit infection, although the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. We show that antiviral immunity in Drosophila requires the transcriptional pausing pathway, including negative elongation factor (NELF) that pauses RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and positive elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which releases paused Pol II to produce full-length transcripts. We identify a set of genes that is rapidly transcribed upon arbovirus infection, including components of antiviral pathways (RNA silencing, autophagy, JAK/STAT, Toll, and Imd) and various Toll receptors. Many of these genes require P-TEFb for expression and exhibit pausing-associated chromatin features. Furthermore, transcriptional pausing is critical for antiviral immunity in insects because NELF and P-TEFb are required to restrict viral replication in adult flies and vector mosquito cells. Thus, transcriptional pausing primes virally induced genes to facilitate rapid gene induction and robust antiviral responses.

Abstract: Altered oxidative stress has long been observed in cancer cells, and this biochemical property of cancer cells represents a specific vulnerability that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit. The major role of an elevated oxidative stress for the efficacy of molecular targeted drugs is under investigation. Menadione is considered an attractive model for the study of oxidative stress, which can induce apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cell lines. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) via its receptors not only promotes cell survival but also reverses apoptosis and promotes cancer progression. Here, we present evidence for the biological role of PGE2 as a protective agent of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in monocytic cells. Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with PGE2 markedly ameliorated the menadione-induced apoptosis and inhibited the degradation of PARP and lamin B. The EP2 receptor antagonist AH6809 abrogated the inhibitory effect of PGE2, suggesting the role of the EP✓cAMP system. The PKA inhibitor H89 also reversed apoptosis and decreased the PKA activity that was elevated 10-fold by PGE2. The treatment of HL-60 cells with NAC or zinc chloride showed a similar protective effect as with PGE2 on menadione-treated cells. Furthermore, PGE2 activated the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway, which in turn initiated ERK activation, and ultimately protected menadione-induced apoptosis. These results imply that PGE2 via cell survival pathways may protect oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in monocytic cells. This study warrants further pre-clinical investigation as well as application towards leukemia clinics.

Abstract: The most prominent capabilities of mesenchymal stem cells (MCSs) which make them promising for therapeutic applications are their capacity to endure and implant in the target tissue. However, the therapeutic applications of these cells are limited due to their early death within the first few days following transplantation. Therefore, to improve cell therapy efficacy, it is necessary to manipulate MSCs to resist severe stresses imposed by microenvironment. In this study, we manipulated MSCs to express a cytoprotective factor, nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) to address this issue. Full-length human Nrf2 cDNA was isolated and TOPO cloned into TOPO cloning vector and then transferred to gateway adapted adenovirus expression vector by LR recombination reaction. Afterwards, the Nrf2 bearing recombinant virus was prepared in appropriate mammalian cell line and used to infect MSCs. The viability and apoptosis of the Nrf2 expressing MSCs were evaluated following hypoxic and oxidative stress conditions. Transient expression of Nrf2 by MSCs protected them against cell death and the apoptosis triggered by hypoxic and oxidative stress conditions. Nrf2 also enhanced the activity of SOD and HO-1. These findings could be used as a strategy for prevention of graft cell death in MSC-based cell therapy. It also indicates that management of cellular stress responses can be used for practical applications.

Abstract: One widespread and conserved Ca2+ entry pathway in eukaryotic cells is the store-operated CRAC channel and Ca2+ entry through these channels activates a disparate array of cellular responses. Under physiological conditions, mitochondria are important regulators of CRAC channel gating. Through these actions, mitochondria help control a range of spatially and temporally distinct CRAC channel-driven responses including enzyme activation, secretion, intercellular communication through paracrine signals and gene expression.

Abstract: Bone consists of type I collagen as a major protein with minor various matrix proteins. Type VI collagen is one of bone matrix proteins but its function is not known. We therefore examined the effects of type VI collagen deficiency on bone. 3D-μCT analysis revealed that type VI collagen deficiency reduced cancellous bone mass. Cortical bone mass was not affected. Type VI collagen deficiency distorted the shape of osteoblasts both in the cancellous bone and in the cambium layer of periosteal region. Furthermore, type VI collagen deficiency disorganized collagen arrangement. These data indicate that type VI collagen contributes to maintain bone mass.

Abstract: The presence of lymphatic vessels in dental pulp has recently been controversial, and no conclusion has been reached. In this study, we investigated the control of lymphangiogenesis with dental pulp development in the mouse mandibular molar using VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGFR-3 as indices of lymphatic vessel-controlling factors. In addition, to distinguish blood and lymphatic vascular epithelial cells, we performed immunohistochemical analysis using von Willebrand factor (vWF) and statistical analysis. In dental papilla in the bell-stage non-calcified period, mesenchymal cells positive for VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGFR-3 increased and lumen-forming endothelial cells were noted, but vWF was negative, suggesting that these were actively forming lymphatic vessels. Positive undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, an increase in endothelial cells in dental pulp, and lumen expansion were noted early after birth. Positivity was also detected in the odontoblast layer and sheath of Hertwig after birth, suggesting that these factors also play important roles in odontoblast differentiation and maturation and periodontal ligament and tooth root formation. We embryologically clarified lymphatic vessel formation in dental pulp and a process of lymphatic vessel formation from blood vessels, suggesting involvement of the surrounding tissue, odontoblasts, and sheath of Hertwig in vessel formation.

Abstract: Background
Notch is one of the most important signaling pathways involved in cell fate determination. Activation of the Notch pathway requires the binding of a membrane-bound ligand to the Notch receptor in the adjacent cell which induces proteolytic cleavages and the activation of the receptor. A unique feature of the Notch signaling is that processes such as modification, endocytosis or recycling of the ligand have been reported to play critical roles during Notch signaling, however, the underlying molecular mechanism appears context-dependent and often controversial.
Results
Here we identified SNX17 as a novel regulator of the Notch pathway. SNX17 is a sorting nexin family protein implicated in vesicular trafficking and we find it is specifically required in the ligand-expressing cells for Notch signaling. Mechanistically, SNX17 regulates the protein level of Jag1a on plasma membrane by binding to Jag1a and facilitating the retromer-dependent recycling of the ligand. In zebrafish, inhibition of this SNX17-mediated Notch signaling pathway results in defects in neurogenesis as well as pancreas development.
Conclusions
Our results reveal that SNX17, by acting as a cargo-specific adaptor, promotes the retromer dependent recycling of Jag1a and Notch signaling and this pathway is involved in cell fate determination during zebrafish neurogenesis and pancreas development.

Abstract: Summary
One of the earliest steps in metazoan pre-mRNA splicing involves binding of U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) 65 KDa subunit to the polypyrimidine (Py) tract and of the 35 KDa subunit to the invariant AG dinucleotide at the intron 3′ end. Here we use in vitro and in vivo depletion, as well as reconstitution assays using purified components, to identify hnRNP A1 as an RNA binding protein that allows U2AF to discriminate between pyrimidine-rich RNA sequences followed or not by a 3′ splice site AG. Biochemical and NMR data indicate that hnRNP A1 forms a ternary complex with the U2AF heterodimer on AG-containing/uridine-rich RNAs, while it displaces U2AF from non-AG-containing/uridine-rich RNAs, an activity that requires the glycine-rich domain of hnRNP A1. Consistent with the functional relevance of this activity for splicing, proofreading assays reveal a role for hnRNP A1 in U2AF-mediated recruitment of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA.

Abstract: Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an intracellular effector of cell–matrix interactions and regulates many cellular processes, including growth, proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. The present work analyzes the role of ILK in wound healing in adult animals using a conditional knock-out of the ILK gene generated with the tamoxifen-inducible Cre-lox system (CRE-LOX mice). Results show that ILK deficiency leads to retarded wound closure in skin. Intracellular mechanisms involved in this process were analyzed in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) isolated from CRE-LOX mice and revealed that wounding promotes rapid activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and ILK. Knockdown of ILK resulted in a retarded wound closure due to a decrease in cellular proliferation and loss of HGF protein expression during the healing process, in vitro and in vivo. Alterations in cell proliferation and wound closure in ILK-deficient MEF or mice could be rescued by exogenous administration of human HGF. These data demonstrate, for the first time, that the activation of PI3K and ILK after skin wounding are critical for HGF-dependent tissue repair and wound healing.

Abstract: The segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is important for the maintenance and transmission of the genome between generations. Recently, we clarified that human mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is required for equal distribution and symmetric segregation of mtDNA in cultured cells; however, the molecular mechanism involved is largely unknown. ClpX is an ATPase associated with various cellular activities (AAA+) proteins that localize to the mitochondrial matrix and is suggested to associate with mtDNA. In this study, we found that RNAi-mediated knockdown of ClpX in HeLa cells resulted in enlarged mtDNA nucleoids, which is very similar to that observed in TFAM-knockdown cells in several properties. The expression of TFAM protein was not significantly reduced in ClpX-knockdown cells. However, the enlarged mtDNA nucleoids caused by ClpX-knockdown were suppressed by overexpression of recombinant TFAM and the phenotype was not observed in knockdown with ClpP, a protease subunit of ClpXP. Endogenous ClpX and TFAM exist in close vicinity, and ClpX enhanced DNA-binding activity of TFAM in vitro. These results suggest that human ClpX, a novel mtDNA regulator, maintains mtDNA nucleoid distribution through TFAM function as a chaperone rather than as a protease and its involvement in mtDNA segregation.

Abstract: Summary
Several species of pathogenic bacteria replicate within an intracellular vacuolar niche. Bacteria that escape into the cytosol are captured by the autophagic pathway and targeted for lysosomal degradation, representing a defense against bacterial exploitation of the host cytosol. Autophagic capture of Salmonella Typhimurium occurs predominantly via generation of a polyubiquitin signal around cytosolic bacteria, binding of adaptor proteins, and recruitment of autophagic machinery. However, the components mediating bacterial target selection and ubiquitination remain obscure. We identify LRSAM1 as the E3 ligase responsible for anti-Salmonella autophagy-associated ubiquitination. LRSAM1 localizes to several intracellular bacterial pathogens and generates the bacteria-associated ubiquitin signal; these functions require LRSAM1's leucine-rich repeat and RING domains, respectively. Using cells from LRSAM1-deficient individuals, we confirm that LRSAM1 is required for ubiquitination associated with intracellular bacteria but dispensable for ubiquitination of aggregated proteins. LRSAM1 is therefore a bacterial recognition protein and ubiquitin ligase that defends the cytoplasm from invasive pathogens.

More than 200 proteins copurify with spliceosomes, the compositionally dynamic RNPs catalyzing pre-mRNA splicing. To better understand protein - protein interactions governing splicing, we systematically investigated interactions between human spliceosomal proteins. A comprehensive Y2H interaction matrix screen generated a protein interaction map comprising 632 interactions between 196 proteins. Among these, 242 interactions were found between spliceosomal core proteins and largely validated by coimmunoprecipitation. To reveal dynamic changes in protein interactions, we integrated spliceosomal complex purification information with our interaction data and performed link clustering. These data, together with interaction competition experiments, suggest that during step 1 of splicing, hPRP8 interactions with SF3b proteins are replaced by hSLU7, positioning this second step factor close to the active site, and that the DEAH-box helicases hPRP2 and hPRP16 cooperate through ordered interactions with GPKOW. Our data provide extensive information about the spliceosomal protein interaction network and its dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
The life span of Caenorhabditis elegans is controlled by signaling between the germline and the soma. Germ cell removal extends life span by triggering the activation of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in the intestine. Here we analyze microRNA function in C. elegans aging and show that the microRNA mir-71 functions to mediate the effects of germ cell loss on life span. mir-71 is required for the life span extension caused by germline removal, and overexpression of mir-71 further extends the life span of animals lacking germ cells. mir-71 functions in the nervous system to facilitate the localization and transcriptional activity of DAF-16 in the intestine. Our findings reveal a microRNA-dependent mechanism of life span regulation by the germline and indicate that signaling among the gonad, the nervous system, and the intestine coordinates the life span of the entire organism.

Abstract: Intracellular heat shock protein (Hsp) 27 is a potent anti-apoptotic factor that, among other activities, prevents the binding of membrane receptor Fas to its ligand FasL. However, the potential role of extracellular Hsp27 and possibilities to control it have not been clarified. Moreover, there are no data on relations between Hsp27, sFas/sFasL system, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)—neither children nor adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum concentrations of Hsp27 and their potential regulators (sFas, sFasL, MMP-7, TIMP-1) in children with CKD and on chronic dialysis. Twenty-six CKD children stage 5 still on conservative treatment, 19 patients on hemodialysis (HD), 22 children on automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), and 30 controls were examined. Serum concentrations of Hsp27, sFas, sFasL, MMP-7, and TIMP-1 were assessed by ELISA. Median values of Hsp27 were significantly elevated in all dialyzed patients vs. those in pre-dialysis period and vs. controls, the highest values being observed in subjects on HD. Regression analysis revealed that MMP-7, TIMP-1, sFas, and sFasL were the best predictors of Hsp27 concentrations in dialyzed patients. Children with CKD are prone to Hsp27 dysfunction, aggravated by the dialysis commencement, and more pronounced in patients on hemodialysis. Correlations between Hsp27 and examined parameters suggest the potential role for Hsp27 as a marker of cell damage in the pediatric population on chronic dialysis.

Abstract: Summary
During the systemic inflammatory response of severe sepsis, neutrophils accumulate in the liver microcirculation, but their functional significance is largely unknown. We show that neutrophils migrate to liver sinusoids during endotoxemia and sepsis where they exert protective effects by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are DNA-based structures that capture and eliminate microbes. NETs released into the vasculature ensnare bacteria from the bloodstream and prevent dissemination. NET production requires platelet-neutrophil interactions and can be inhibited by platelet depletion or disruption of integrin-mediated platelet-neutrophil binding. During sepsis, NET release increases bacterial trapping by 4-fold (beyond the basal level provided by resident intravascular macrophages). Blocking NET formation reduces the capture of circulating bacteria during sepsis, resulting in increased dissemination to distant organs. Thus, NETs ensnare circulating bacteria and provide intravascular immunity that protects against bacterial dissemination during septic infections.

Abstract: Summary
Variations in lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial outer membrane component, determine virulence of the obligate intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We find that while avirulent C. burnetii LPS (avLPS) stimulates host p38α-MAPK signaling required for proper trafficking of bacteria containing compartments to lysosomes for destruction, pathogenic C. burnetii LPS (vLPS) does not. The defect in vLPS and pathogenic C. burnetii targeting to degradative compartments involves an antagonistic engagement of TLR4 by vLPS, lack of p38α-MAPK-driven phosphorylation, and block in recruitment of the homotypic fusion and protein-sorting complex component Vps41 to vLPS-containing vesicles. An upstream activator of p38α-MAPK or phosphomimetic mutant Vps41-S796E expression overrides the inhibition, allowing vLPS and pathogenic C. burnetii targeting to phagolysosomes. Thus, p38α-MAPK and its crosstalk with Vps41 play a central role in trafficking bacteria to phagolysosomes. Pathogenic C. burnetii has evolved LPS variations to evade this host response and thrive intracellularly.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is linked to dynamic actin cytoskeleton reorganization, which is involved in tumor cell motility and metastasis. Thus, inhibition of ROS generation and actin polymerization in tumor cells may represent an effective anticancer strategy. However, the molecular basis of this signaling pathway is currently unknown. Here, we show that the Ecklonia cava-derived antioxidant dieckol downregulates the Rac1/ROS signaling pathway and inhibits Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (wAVE2)-mediated invasive migration of B16 mouse melanoma cells. Steady-state intracellular ROS levels were higher in malignant B16F10 cells than in parental, nonmetastatic B16F0 cells. Elevation of ROS by H2O2 treatment increased migration and invasion ability of B16F0 cells to level similar to that of B16F10 cells, suggesting that intracellular ROS signaling mediates the prometastatic properties of B16 mouse melanoma cells. ROS levels and the cell migration and invasion ability of B16 melanoma cells correlated with Rac1 activation and WAVE2 expression. Overexpression of dominant negative Rac1 and depletion of WAVE2 by siRNA suppressed H2O2-induced cell invasion of B16F0 and B16F10 cells. Similarly, dieckol attenuates the ROS-mediated Rac1 activation and WAVE2 expression, resulting in decreased migration and invasion of B16 melanoma cells. In addition, we found that dieckol decreases association between WAVE2 and NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox. Therefore, this finding suggests that WAVE2 acts to couple intracellular Rac1/ROS signaling to the invasive migration of B16 melanoma cells, which is inhibited by dieckol.

Abstract: Summary
Germline mutations that inactivate BRCA2 promote early-onset cancer with chromosome instability. Here, we report that BRCA2 regulates the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Previously, we reported that BubR1 acetylation is essential for SAC activity. In this study we show that BRCA2 recruits the PCAF acetyltransferase and aids in BubR1 acetylation during mitosis. In the absence of BRCA2, BubR1 acetylation is abolished, and the level of BubR1 decreases during mitosis. Similarly, Brca2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibited weak SAC activity. Transgenic mice that were engineered to have interruptions in the BRCA2-BubR1 association exhibited marked decrease of BubR1 acetylation, weakened SAC activity, and aneuploidy. These transgenic mice developed spontaneous tumors at 40% penetrance. Moreover, immunohistochemical analyses of human breast cancer specimens suggested that BRCA2 mutation and BubR1 status is closely linked. Our results provide an explanation for how mutation of BRCA2 can lead to chromosome instability without apparent mutations in SAC components.

Abstract: Summary
Colitis results from breakdown of homeostasis between intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system, with both environmental and genetic influencing factors. Flagellin receptor TLR5-deficient mice (T5KO) display elevated intestinal proinflammatory gene expression and colitis with incomplete penetrance, providing a genetically sensitized system to study the contribution of microbiota to driving colitis. Both colitic and noncolitic T5KO exhibited transiently unstable microbiotas, with lasting differences in colitic T5KO, while their noncolitic siblings stabilized their microbiotas to resemble wild-type mice. Transient high levels of proteobacteria, especially enterobacteria species including E. coli, observed in close proximity to the gut epithelium were a striking feature of colitic microbiota. A Crohn’s disease-associated E. coli strain induced chronic colitis in T5KO, which persisted well after the exogenously introduced bacterial species had been eliminated. Thus, an innate immune deficiency can result in unstable gut microbiota associated with low-grade inflammation, and harboring proteobacteria can drive and/or instigate chronic colitis.

Abstract: Summary
Current antiangiogenic agents used to treat cancer only partially inhibit neovascularization and cause normal tissue toxicities, fueling the need to identify therapeutic agents that are more selective for pathological angiogenesis. Tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8), also known as anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1), is a highly conserved cell-surface protein overexpressed on tumor-infiltrating vasculature. Here we show that genetic disruption of Tem8 results in impaired growth of human tumor xenografts of diverse origin including melanoma, breast, colon, and lung cancer. Furthermore, antibodies developed against the TEM8 extracellular domain blocked anthrax intoxication, inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis, displayed broad antitumor activity, and augmented the activity of clinically approved anticancer agents without added toxicity. Thus, TEM8 targeting may allow selective inhibition of pathological angiogenesis.

Abstract: Every cell or neuronal type utilizes its own specific organization of its Ca2+ homeostasis depending on its specific function and its physiological needs. The magnocellular neurones, with their somata situated in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and their nerve terminals populating the posterior hypophysis (neural lobe) are a typical and classical example of a neuroendocrine system, and an important experimental model for attempting to understand the characteristics of the neuronal organization of Ca2+ homeostasis. The magnocellular neurones synthesize, in a cell specific manner, two neurohormones: arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT), which can be released, in a strict Ca2+-dependent manner, both at the axonal terminals, in the neural lobe, and at the somatodendritic level. The two types of neurones show also distinct type of bioelectrical activity, associated with specific secretory patterns. In these neurones, the Ca2+ homeostatic pathways such as the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ pump, the plasmalemmal Ca2+ pump (PMCA) and the mitochondria are acting in a complementary fashion in clearing Ca2+ loads that follow neuronal stimulation. The somatodendritic AVP and OT release closely correlates with intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. More importantly, the ER Ca2+ stores play a major role in Ca2+ homeostatic mechanism in identified OT neurones. The balance between the Ca2+ homeostatic systems that are in the supraoptic neurones differ from those active in the terminals, in which mainly Ca2+ extrusion through the Ca2+ pump in the plasma membrane and uptake by mitochondria are active. In both AVP and OT nerve terminals, no functional ER Ca2+ stores can be evidenced experimentally. We conclude that the physiological significance of the complexity of Ca2+ homeostatic mechanisms in the somatodendritic region of supraoptic neurones and their terminals can be multifaceted, attributable, in major part, to their specialized electrical activity and Ca2+-dependent neurohormone release.

Abstract: Secretory vesicles of chromaffin cells are acidic organelles that maintain an increasing pH gradient towards the cytosol (5.5 vs. 7.3) that is mediated by V-ATPase activity. This gradient is primarily responsible for the accumulation of large concentrations of amines and Ca2+, although the mechanisms mediating Ca2+ uptake and release from granules, and the physiological relevance of these processes, remain unclear. The presence of a vesicular matrix appears to create a bi-compartmentalised medium in which the major fractions of solutes, including catecholamines, nucleotides and Ca2+, are strongly associated with vesicle proteins, particularly chromogranins. This association appears to be favoured at acidic pH values. It has been demonstrated that disrupting the pH gradient of secretory vesicles reduces their rate of exocytosis and promotes the leakage of vesicular amines and Ca2+, dramatically increasing the movement of secretory vesicles and triggering exocytosis. In this short review, we will discuss the data available that highlights the importance of pH in regulating the association between chromogranins, vesicular amines and Ca2+. We will also address the potential role of vesicular Ca2+ in two major processes in secretory cells, vesicle movement and exocytosis.

Is ryanodine receptor a calcium or magnesium channel? Roles of K+ and Mg2+ during Ca2+ release,

Abstract: The ryanodine receptor (RyR) is a poorly selective channel that mediates Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. How RyR's selectivity between the physiological cations K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ affects single-channel Ca2+ current amplitude is examined using a recent model of RyR permeation. It is found that K+ provides the vast majority of the countercurrent (through RyR itself) that is needed to prevent the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane potential from changing and stopping Ca2+ release. Moreover, intra-pore competition between Ca2+ and Mg2+ defines single RyR Ca2+ current amplitude. Since both [Mg2+] and [Ca2+]SR can change during pathophysiological conditions, the RyR unitary Ca2+ current amplitude during Ca2+ release may change significantly due to this Ca2+/Mg2+ competition. Compared to the classic action of Mg2+ on RyR open probability, these Ca2+ current amplitude changes have as large or larger effects on overall RyR Ca2+ mobilization. A new aspect of RyR divalent versus monovalent selectivity is also identified where this kind of selectivity decreases as divalent concentration increases.

Abstract: Summary
We investigated the role of autophagy in atherosclerosis. During plaque formation in mice, autophagic markers colocalized predominantly with macrophages (mϕ). Atherosclerotic aortas had elevated levels of p62, suggesting that dysfunctional autophagy is characteristic of plaques. To determine whether autophagy directly influences atherogenesis, we characterized Beclin-1 heterozygous-null and mϕ-specific ATG5-null (ATG5-mϕKO) mice, commonly used models of autophagy haploinsufficiency and deficiency, respectively. Haploinsufficent Beclin-1 mice had no atherosclerotic phenotype, but ATG5-mϕKO mice had increased plaques, suggesting an essential role for basal levels of autophagy in atheroprotection. Defective autophagy is associated with proatherogenic inflammasome activation. Classic inflammasome markers were robustly induced in ATG5-null mϕ, especially when coincubated with cholesterol crystals. Moreover, cholesterol crystals appear to be increased in ATG5-mϕKO plaques, suggesting a potentially vicious cycle of crystal formation and inflammasome activation in autophagy-deficient plaques. These results show that autophagy becomes dysfunctional in atherosclerosis and its deficiency promotes atherosclerosis in part through inflammasome hyperactivation.

Abstract: Understanding the molecular programs of the generation of human dopaminergic neurons (DAn) from their ventral mesencephalic (VM) precursors is of key importance for basic studies, progress in cell therapy, drug screening and pharmacology in the context of Parkinson's disease. The nature of human DAn precursors in vitro is poorly understood, their properties unstable, and their availability highly limited. Here we present positive evidence that human VM precursors retaining their genuine properties and long-term capacity to generate A9 type Substantia nigra human DAn (hVM1 model cell line) can be propagated in culture. During a one month differentiation, these cells activate all key genes needed to progress from pro-neural and pro-dopaminergic precursors to mature and functional DAn. For the first time, we demonstrate that gene cascades are correctly activated during differentiation, resulting in the generation of mature DAn. These DAn have morphological and functional properties undistinguishable from those generated by VM primary neuronal cultures. In addition, we have found that the forced expression of Bcl-XL induces an increase in the expression of key developmental genes (MSX1, NGN2), maintenance of PITX3 expression temporal profile, and also enhances genes involved in DAn long-term function, maintenance and survival (EN1, LMX1B, NURR1 and PITX3). As a result, Bcl-XL anticipates and enhances DAn generation.

Abstract: Summary
Commensal bacteria impact host health and immunity through various mechanisms, including the production of immunomodulatory molecules. Bacteroides fragilis produces a capsular polysaccharide (PSA), which induces regulatory T cells and mucosal tolerance. However, unlike pathogens, which employ secretion systems, the mechanisms by which commensal bacteria deliver molecules to the host remain unknown. We reveal that Bacteroides fragilis releases PSA in outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that induce immunomodulatory effects and prevent experimental colitis. Dendritic cells (DCs) sense OMV-associated PSA through TLR2, resulting in enhanced regulatory T cells and anti-inflammatory cytokine production. OMV-induced signaling in DCs requires growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein (Gadd45α). DCs treated with PSA-containing OMVs prevent experimental colitis, whereas Gadd45α−/− DCs are unable to promote regulatory T cell responses or suppress proinflammatory cytokine production and host pathology. These findings demonstrate that OMV-mediated delivery of a commensal molecule prevents disease, uncovering a mechanism of interkingdom communication between the microbiota and mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Muscle cells have a remarkable capability to repair plasma membrane lesions. Mutations in dysferlin (dysf) are known to elicit a progressive myopathy in humans, probably due to impaired sarcolemmal repair. We show here that loss of Dysf and annexin A6 (Anxa6) function lead to myopathy in zebrafish. By use of high-resolution imaging of myofibers in intact animals, we reveal sequential phases in sarcolemmal repair. Initially, membrane vesicles enriched in Dysf together with cytoplasmic Anxa6 form a tight patch at the lesion independently of one another. In the subsequent steps, annexin A2a (Anxa2a) followed by annexin A1a (Anxa1a) accumulate at the patch; the recruitment of these annexins depends on Dysf and Anxa6. Thus, sarcolemmal repair relies on the ordered assembly of a protein-membrane scaffold. Moreover, we provide several lines of evidence that the membrane for sarcolemmal repair is derived from a specialized plasma membrane compartment.

Abstract: Abscisic acid stress ripening (ASR1) protein is a small hydrophilic, low molecular weight, and stress-specific plant protein. The gene coding region of ASR1 protein, which is induced under high salinity in rice (Oryza sativa Ilmi), was cloned into a yeast expression vector pVTU260 and transformed into yeast cells. Heterologous expression of ASR1 protein in transgenic yeast cells improved tolerance to abiotic stresses including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), high salinity (NaCl), heat shock, menadione, copper sulfate, sulfuric acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, and also high concentration of ethanol. In particular, the expression of metabolic enzymes (Fba1p, Pgk1p, Eno2p, Tpi1p, and Adh1p), antioxidant enzyme (Ahp1p), molecular chaperone (Ssb1p), and pyrimidine biosynthesis-related enzyme (Ura1p) was up-regulated in the transgenic yeast cells under oxidative stress when compared with wild-type cells. All of these enzymes contribute to an alleviated redox state to H2O2-induced oxidative stress. In the in vitro assay, the purified ASR1 protein was able to scavenge ROS by converting H2O2 to H2O. Taken together, these results suggest that the ASR1 protein could function as an effective ROS scavenger and its expression could enhance acquired tolerance of ROS-induced oxidative stress through induction of various cell rescue proteins in yeast cells.

Metabolic Adaptation to Tissue Iron Overload Confers Tolerance to Malaria,

Abstract: Summary
Disease tolerance is a defense strategy that limits the fitness costs of infection irrespectively of pathogen burden. While restricting iron (Fe) availability to pathogens is perceived as a host defense strategy, the resulting tissue Fe overload can be cytotoxic and promote tissue damage to exacerbate disease severity. Examining this interplay during malaria, the disease caused by Plasmodium infection, we find that expression of the Fe sequestering protein ferritin H chain (FtH) in mice, and ferritin in humans, is associated with reduced tissue damage irrespectively of pathogen burden. FtH protection relies on its ferroxidase activity, which prevents labile Fe from sustaining proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. FtH expression is inhibited by JNK activation, promoting tissue Fe overload, tissue damage, and malaria severity. Mimicking FtH’s antioxidant effect or inhibiting JNK activation pharmacologically confers therapeutic tolerance to malaria in mice. Thus, FtH provides metabolic adaptation to tissue Fe overload, conferring tolerance to malaria.

Abstract: Summary
Viral nucleic acids often trigger an innate immune response in infected cells. Many viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), have evolved mechanisms to evade intracellular recognition. Nevertheless, HCV-permissive cells can trigger a viral RNA-, TLR7-, and cell-contact-dependent compensatory interferon response in nonpermissive plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Here we report that these events are mediated by transfer of HCV-RNA-containing exosomes from infected cells to pDCs. The exosomal viral RNA transfer is dependent on the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery and on Annexin A2, an RNA-binding protein involved in membrane vesicle trafficking, and is suppressed by exosome release inhibitors. Further, purified concentrated HCV-RNA-containing exosomes are sufficient to activate pDCs. Thus, vesicular sequestration and exosomal export of viral RNA may serve both as a viral strategy to evade pathogen sensing within infected cells and as a host strategy to induce an unopposed innate response in replication-nonpermissive bystander cells.

Abstract: Cryptogein is a proteinaceous elicitor secreted by the oomycete Phytophthora cryptogea, which induces a hypersensitive response in tobacco plants. We have previously reported that in tobacco BY-2 cells treated with cryptogein, most of the genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway were upregulated and cell wall-bound phenolics accumulated. Both events were Ca2+ dependent. In this study, we designed a microarray covering a large proportion of the tobacco genome and monitored gene expression in cryptogein-elicited BY-2 cells to get a more complete view of the transcriptome changes and to assess their Ca2+ dependence. The predominant functional gene categories affected by cryptogein included stress- and disease-related proteins, phenylpropanoid pathway, signaling components, transcription factors and cell wall reinforcement. Among the 3819 unigenes whose expression changed more than fourfold, 90% were Ca2+ dependent, as determined by their sensitivity to lanthanum chloride. The most Ca2+-dependent transcripts upregulated by cryptogein were involved in defense responses or the oxylipin pathway. This genome-wide study strongly supports the importance of Ca2+-dependent transcriptional regulation of regulatory and defense-related genes contributing to cryptogein responses in tobacco.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic cells possess many transcriptionally regulated mechanisms to alleviate the nucleosome barrier. Dramatic changes to the chromatin structure of Drosophila melanogaster Hsp70 gene loci are dependent on the transcriptional activator, heat shock factor (HSF), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Here, we find that PARP is associated with the 5′ end of Hsp70, and its enzymatic activity is rapidly induced by heat shock. This activation causes PARP to redistribute throughout Hsp70 loci and Poly(ADP-ribose) to concurrently accumulate in the wake of PARP's spread. HSF is necessary for both the activation of PARP's enzymatic activity and its redistribution. Upon heat shock, HSF triggers these PARP activities mechanistically by directing Tip60 acetylation of histone H2A lysine 5 at the 5′ end of Hsp70, where inactive PARP resides before heat shock. This acetylation is critical for the activation and spread of PARP as well as for the rapid nucleosome loss over the Hsp70 loci.

Abstract: Summary
Lymphatic valves are essential for efficient lymphatic transport, but the mechanisms of early lymphatic-valve morphogenesis and the role of biomechanical forces are not well understood. We found that the transcription factors PROX1 and FOXC2, highly expressed from the onset of valve formation, mediate segregation of lymphatic-valve-forming cells and cell mechanosensory responses to shear stress in vitro. Mechanistically, PROX1, FOXC2, and flow coordinately control expression of the gap junction protein connexin37 and activation of calcineurin/NFAT signaling. Connexin37 and calcineurin are required for the assembly and delimitation of lymphatic valve territory during development and for its postnatal maintenance. We propose a model in which regionally increased levels/activation states of transcription factors cooperate with mechanotransduction to induce a discrete cell-signaling pattern and morphogenetic event, such as formation of lymphatic valves. Our results also provide molecular insights into the role of endothelial cell identity in the regulation of vascular mechanotransduction.

Abstract: Summary
The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) comprises multiple heptapeptide repeats of the consensus Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7. Reversible phosphorylation of Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7 during the transcription cycle mediates the sequential recruitment of transcription/RNA processing factors. Phosphorylation of Ser7 is required for recruitment of the gene type-specific Integrator complex to the Pol II-transcribed small nuclear (sn)RNA genes. Here, we show that RNA Pol II-associated protein 2 (RPAP2) specifically recognizes the phospho-Ser7 mark on the Pol II CTD and also interacts with Integrator subunits. siRNA-mediated knockdown of RPAP2 and mutation of Ser7 to alanine cause similar defects in snRNA gene expression. In addition, we show that RPAP2 is a CTD Ser5 phosphatase. Taken together, our results indicate that during transcription of snRNA genes, Ser7 phosphorylation facilitates recruitment of RPAP2, which in turn both recruits Integrator and dephosphorylates Ser5.

Abstract: Corticosteroid hormones, which are released in high amounts after stress, easily pass the blood–brain-barrier. In the brain they bind to intracellular receptors which act as transcriptional regulators. These receptors are highly expressed in neurons of the hippocampal formation and the amygdala, areas that play a role in (emotional) memory formation. Voltage gated Ca2+ channels are among the most prominent targets of corticosteroid hormones. When the levels of corticosterone - the prevalent corticosteroid in rats and mice- are low, L-type Ca2+ currents of CA1 hippocampal cells are small. However, when hormone levels rise e.g. after stress, the amplitude of L-type Ca2+ currents will be slowly enhanced, through a process requiring DNA binding of glucocorticoid receptor homodimers. Kinetic properties and voltage dependency of the currents remain unchanged. Neurons in the basolateral amygdala respond in a comparable fashion, but Ca2+ currents of neurons in the dentate gyrus are unaffected by corticosteroids. The stress-induced increase in Ca2+ influx has considerable functional consequences in health and disease. At the short term, i.e. 1–4h after stress, the enhanced Ca2+ influx contributes to stronger firing frequency accommodation and a higher threshold for the induction of long-term potentiation. This helps to normalize neuronal activity after stress and presumably protects earlier encoded, stress-related information. At the longer term, though, increased Ca2+ load may impose a risk, increasing the vulnerability of limbic cells to additional challenges e.g. during epileptic or ischemic episodes.

Abstract: The buccal cavity of an herbivorous fish Oreochromis niloticus was investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy. The buccal cavity distinguished into the roof and the floor. Three different types of taste buds (type I, II and III) are distributed in the buccal cavity. The proximal part of the buccal cavity bears relatively high epidermal papillae in which type I TBs was found. The middle region of the buccal cavity is mostly occupied by low epidermal papillae containing type II TBs. Type III TBs which are present within the metabranchial buccal cavity; never rise above the normal level of the epithelium. The different types of TBs are useful for ensuring full utilization of the gustatory ability of the fish. It is postulated that the TBs serve different functions: TBs type I and II may act as chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors. TBs type III acts predominantly as a chemoreceptors. TBs of each type show two kinds of receptor villi within their receptor areas: tall villi and small villi. The surface of the lining epithelial cells shows a delicate microridge system. These structures protect against physical abrasion potentially caused during food maneuvering and swallowing. Furthermore, protection of the epithelium from abrasion is enhanced with goblet cells secretion.

Abstract: The present study aimed to determine whether dentine tissue and preparations of extracellular matrix (ECM) from pulp (pECM) and dentine (dECM), and breakdown products, influenced pulp cell migration. Chemotaxis transwell and agarose spot assays demonstrated that both dentine and pulp ECM molecules acted as chemoattractants for primary pulp cells. Chemoattractant activities of dECM and pECM were enhanced when subjected to acid and enzymatic breakdown, respectively. This enhanced activity following physiologically relevant breakdown may be pertinent to the disease environment. Pulp cell migration in response to dental ECMs was dependent on an active rho pathway. Recruited cells exhibited increased stem cell marker expression indicating that dental ECMs and their breakdown products selectively attract progenitor cells that contribute to repair processes. In conclusion, combined these results indicate that ECM molecules contribute to cell recruitment necessary for regeneration of the dentine-pulp complex after injury.

Abstract: Summary
BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) fail to eliminate quiescent leukemia stem cells (LSC) in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Thus, strategies targeting LSC are required to achieve cure. We show that the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 is overexpressed in human CML LSC. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 or SIRT1 knockdown increased apoptosis in LSC of chronic phase and blast crisis CML and reduced their growth in vitro and in vivo. SIRT1 effects were enhanced in combination with the BCR-ABL TKI imatinib. SIRT1 inhibition increased p53 acetylation and transcriptional activity in CML progenitors, and the inhibitory effects of SIRT1 targeting on CML cells depended on p53 expression and acetylation. Activation of p53 via SIRT1 inhibition represents a potential approach to target CML LSC.

Abstract: Summary
A key event in Wnt signaling is conversion of TCF/Lef from a transcriptional repressor to an activator, yet how this switch occurs is not well understood. Here, we report an unanticipated role for X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) in regulating this critical Wnt signaling event that is independent of its antiapoptotic function. We identified DIAP1 as a positive regulator of Wingless signaling in a Drosophila S2 cell-based RNAi screen. XIAP, its vertebrate homolog, is similarly required for Wnt signaling in cultured mammalian cells and in Xenopus embryos, indicating evolutionary conservation of function. Upon Wnt pathway activation, XIAP is recruited to TCF/Lef where it monoubiquitylates Groucho (Gro)/TLE. This modification decreases affinity of Gro/TLE for TCF/Lef. Our data reveal a transcriptional switch involving XIAP-mediated ubiquitylation of Gro/TLE that facilitates its removal from TCF/Lef, thus allowing β-catenin-TCF/Lef complex assembly and initiation of a Wnt-specific transcriptional program.

Abstract: Aphanius dispar, a freshwater fish (mean total length±sd, 3.42±0.33cm) was exposed to different concentrations of deltamethrin (2.25, 2.50 and 3.00μgL−1), an insecticide used to control Dubas bug, Ommatissus lybicus in Oman. The histopathological changes in the structure of the gills in fish exposed to deltamethrin was studied using light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. In light microscopy, the fish exposed to 2.25μgL−1 deltamethrin, showed hypertrophy and hyperplasia of chloride cells, while in 2.50μgL−1, additional changes like vacuolization, lifting of the lamellar epithelium and fusion of secondary lamellae were observed. The most severe alteration including vacuolization, desquamation of cells and dilation of intercellular space was recorded at 3.00μgL−1. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy, supports the findings of light microscopy and further document the ultrastructural damage caused, especially in exposure to 2.50 and 3.00μgL−1. Al l changes observed are described in detail. The deltamethrin exposure concentration of 2.25μgL−1 seems to be a threshold above which any small increase in concentration results in severe damage. All present results have been compared with those of previous studies on gill damage caused by various chemical substances. The impacts of the damage on the functioning of gills as a respiratory organ are discussed.

Abstract: Summary
The vertebrate body forms in an anterior-to-posterior progression, driven by a population of undifferentiated cells at the posterior-most end of the embryo. Recent studies have demonstrated that these undifferentiated cells are multipotent stem cells, suggesting that local signaling factors specify cell fate. However, the mechanism of cell fate specification during this process is unknown. Using a combination of single cell transplantation and newly developed cell-autonomous inducible Wnt inhibitor and activator transgenic zebrafish lines, we show that canonical Wnt signaling is continuously necessary and sufficient to specify mesoderm from a bipotential neural/mesodermal precursor. Surprisingly, we also find that Wnt signaling functions subsequently within the mesoderm to specify somites instead of posterior vascular endothelium. Our results demonstrate that dynamic local Wnt signaling cues specify germ layer contribution and mesodermal tissue type specification of multipotent stem cells throughout the formation of the early vertebrate embryonic body.

Abstract: Summary
We report that mice ablated for the Sam68 RNA-binding protein exhibit a lean phenotype as a result of increased energy expenditure, decreased commitment to early adipocyte progenitors, and defects in adipogenic differentiation. The Sam68−/− mice were protected from obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance induced with a high-fat diet. To identify the alternative splice events regulated by Sam68, genome-wide exon usage profiling in white adipose tissue was performed. Adipocytes from Sam68−/− mice retained intron 5 within the mTOR transcript introducing a premature termination codon, leading to an unstable mRNA. Consequently, Sam68-depleted cells had reduced mTOR levels resulting in lower levels of insulin-stimulated S6 and Akt phosphorylation leading to defects in adipogenesis, and this defect was rescued by the exogenous expression of full-length mTOR. Sam68 bound intronic splice elements within mTOR intron 5 required for the usage of the 5′ splice site. We propose that Sam68 regulates alternative splicing during adipogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeres form the site of chromosome attachment to microtubules during mitosis. Identity of these loci is maintained epigenetically by nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A. Propagation of CENP-A chromatin is uncoupled from DNA replication initiating only during mitotic exit. We now demonstrate that inhibition of Cdk1 and Cdk2 activities is sufficient to trigger CENP-A assembly throughout the cell cycle in a manner dependent on the canonical CENP-A assembly machinery. We further show that the key CENP-A assembly factor Mis18BP1HsKNL2 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner that controls its centromere localization during mitotic exit. These results strongly support a model in which the CENP-A assembly machinery is poised for activation throughout the cell cycle but kept in an inactive noncentromeric state by Cdk activity during S, G2, and M phases. Alleviation of this inhibition in G1 phase ensures tight coupling between DNA replication, cell division, and subsequent centromere maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Translation arrest leads to an endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNA that is termed no-go decay (NGD). It has been reported that the Dom34:Hbs1 complex stimulates this endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNA induced by translation arrest in vivo and dissociates subunits of a stalled ribosome in vitro. Here we report that Dom34:Hbs1 dissociates the subunits of a ribosome that is stalled at the 3′ end of mRNA in vivo, and has a crucial role in both NGD and nonstop decay. Dom34:Hbs1-mediated dissociation of a ribosome that is stalled at the 3′ end of mRNA is required for degradation of a 5′-NGD intermediate. Dom34:Hbs1 facilitates the decay of nonstop mRNAs from the 3′ end by exosomes and is required for the complete degradation of nonstop mRNA decay intermediates. We propose that Dom34:Hbs1 stimulates degradation of the 5′-NGD intermediate and of nonstop mRNA by dissociating the ribosome that is stalled at the 3′ end of the mRNA.

Abstract: Peroxiredoxins (Prxs), which are classified into three isotypes in plants, play important roles in protection systems as peroxidases or molecular chaperones. The three Prx isotypes of Chinese cabbage, namely C1C-Prx, C2C-Prx, and C-PrxII, have recently been identified and characterized. The present study compares their molecular properties and biochemical functions to gain insights into their concerted roles in plants. The three Prx isotype genes were differentially expressed in tissue- and developmental stage-specific manners. The transcript level of the C1C-Prx gene was abundant at the seed stage, but rapidly decreased after imbibitions. In contrast, the C2C-Prx transcript was not detected in the seeds, but its expression level increased at germination and was maintained thereafter. The C-PrxII transcript level was mild at the seed stage, rapidly increased for 10 days after imbibitions, and gradually disappeared thereafter. In the localization analysis using GFP-fusion proteins, the three isotypes showed different cellular distributions. C1C-Prx was localized in the cytosol and nucleus, whereas C2C-Prx and C-Prx were found mainly in the chloroplast and cytosol, respectively. In vitro thiol-dependent antioxidant assays revealed that the relative peroxidase activities of the isotypes were C-PrxII > C2C-Prx > C1C-Prx. C1C-Prx and C2C-Prx, but not C-PrxII, prevented aggregation of malate dehydrogenase as a molecular chaperone. Taken together, these results suggest that the three isotypes of Prx play specific roles in the cells in timely and spatially different manners, but they also cooperate with each other to protect the plant.

Abstract: Summary
The VAPB/ALS8 major sperm protein domain (vMSP) is implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy, yet its function in the nervous system is not well understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, the vMSP is cleaved from its transmembrane anchor and secreted in a cell type-specific fashion. We show that vMSPs secreted by neurons act on Lar-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase and Roundabout growth cone guidance receptors expressed in striated muscle. This signaling pathway promotes Arp2/3-dependent actin remodeling and mitochondrial localization to actin-rich muscle I-bands. C. elegans VAPB mutants have mitochondrial localization, morphology, mobility, and fission/fusion defects that are suppressed by Lar-like receptor or Arp2/3 inactivation. Hence, growth cone guidance receptor pathways that remodel the actin cytoskeleton have unanticipated effects on mitochondrial dynamics. We propose that neurons secrete vMSPs to promote striated muscle energy production and metabolism, in part through the regulation of mitochondrial localization and function.

Abstract: Thioredoxin (Trx) is a small redox protein existing ubiquitously in all living organisms and plays an important role in multiple cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and immune response. To date very few studies have been carried out to examine the function of piscine Trx. In this study, we identified and analyzed the function of a Trx homologue, CsTrx1, from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). The deduced amino acid sequence of CsTrx1 is composed of 107 residues and shares 54.1−60.8% overall identities with the Trx of other teleosts. CsTrx1 contains the highly conserved CXXC motif, which in mammals is known to be the active site, in the form of CQPC. Expression of CsTrx1 as determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was highest in liver and upregulated in time-dependent manners by bacterial infection and by exposure to iron, copper, and hydrogen peroxide. Purified recombinant CsTrx1 (rCsTrx1) exhibited insulin disulfide reductase activity and antioxidant activity, both which, however, were lost when the two cysteine residues in the CQPC motif were mutated to serine. Further analysis showed that rCsTrx1 was able to stimulate the proliferation of head kidney leukocytes, upregulate the expression of immune relevant genes, and enhance the resistance of leukocytes against bacterial infection. Taken together, these results indicate that CsTrx1 is a biologically active reductase and an antioxidant that requires the CXXC motif for activity and that CsTrx1 possesses cytokine-like immunoregulatory property. These results suggest a role for CsTrx1 in protecting cells against oxidative stress caused by oxidant exposure and pathogen infection.

Abstract: While genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) allow Ca2+ imaging in model organisms, the gene expression is often under the control of a single promoter that may drive expression beyond, the cell types of interest. To enable more cell-type specific targeting, GECIs can be brought under the, control of the intersecting expression from two promoters. Here, we present the splitting and, reassembly of two representative GECIs (TN-XL and GCaMP2) mediated by the split intein from Nostoc, punctiforme (NpuDnaE). While the split TN-XL biosensor offered ratiometric Ca2+ imaging, it had a, diminished Ca2+ response relative to the native TN-XL biosensor. In contrast, the split GCaMP2, biosensor retained similar Ca2+ response to the native GCaMP2. The split GCaMP2 biosensor was, further targeted to the pharyngeal muscles of Caenorhabditis elegans where Ca2+ signals from feeding C. elegans, were imaged. Thus, we envision that increased cell-type targetability of GECIs is feasible with two, complementary promoters.

Abstract: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) was studied in three human lung cells – P (fetal lung-derived cells), A549 (lung adenocarcinoma) and SK-MES-1 (squamous cell carcinoma) using a fluorescent cytochemical procedure developed on the basis of the substrate 4-(glycyl-l-prolyl hydrazido)-N-hexyl-1,8-naphthalimide. The observed differences in the enzyme expression were confirmed by measuring the enzyme hydrolysis of glycyl-l-prolyl-para-nitroanilide. The surface and total dipeptidyl peptidase activities of P cells were correspondingly 7–8 and 3–10 times higher than those of SK-MES-1 and A549 cells. The ratio surface per total activity showed that in P (95%) and A549 (93%) cells the enzyme is associated with the plasmalemma while in SK-MES-1 cells (35%) it is bound to intracellular membranes. In order to compare the results from cell cultures with those in human tumor, the enzyme activity was investigated in cryo-sections of three cases of diagnosed squamous lung carcinoma. DPPIV activity was restricted to the connective tissue stroma surrounding the DPPIV-negative tumor foci.

Abstract: Ectotherms from sunny and hot environments need to cope with solar radiation. Mediterranean land snails of the superfamily Helicoidea feature a behavioural strategy to escape from solar radiation-induced excessive soil heating by climbing up vertical objects. The height of climbing, and also other parameters like shell colouration pattern, shell orientation, shell size, body mass, actual internal and shell surface temperature, and the interactions between those factors may be expected to modulate proteotoxic effects in snails exposed to solar radiation and, thus, their stress response. Focussing on natural populations of Xeropicta derbentina, we conducted a ‘snapshot’ field study using the individual Hsp70 level as a proxy for proteotoxic stress. In addition to correlation analyses, an IT-model selection approach based on Akaike’s Information Criterion was applied to evaluate a set of models with respect to their explanatory power and to assess the relevance of each of the above-mentioned parameters for individual stress, by model averaging and parameter estimation. The analysis revealed particular importance of the individuals’ shell size, height above ground, the shell colouration pattern and the interaction height × orientation. Our study showed that a distinct set of behavioural traits and intrinsic characters define the Hsp70 level and that environmental factors and individual features strongly interact.

Abstract: The biological functions of Myc are to regulate cell growth, apoptosis, cell differentiation and stem-cell self-renewal. Abnormal accumulation of c-Myc is able to induce excessive proliferation of normal cells. von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) is a key regulator of hypoxia-inducible factor1α (HIF1α), thus accumulation and hyperactivation of HIF1α is the most prominent feature of VHL-mutated renal cell carcinoma. Interestingly, the Myc pathway is reported to be activated in renal cell carcinoma even though the precise molecular mechanism still remains to be established. Here, we demonstrated that pVHL locates at the c-Myc promoter region through physical interaction with Myc. Furthermore, pVHL reinforces HDAC1/2 recruitment to the Myc promoter, which leads to the auto-suppression of Myc. Therefore, one possible mechanism of Myc auto-suppression by pVHL entails removing histone acetylation. Our study identifies a novel mechanism for pVHL-mediated negative regulation of c-Myc transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferons (IFNs) are considered to be the universal mechanism by which viral infections are controlled. However, many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) rely on antiviral pathways that are toxic to host cells, which may be detrimental in nonrenewable cell types, such as neurons. We show that dorsal root ganglionic (DRG) neurons produced little type I IFNs in response to infection with a neurotropic virus, herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1). Further, type I IFN treatment failed to completely block HSV-1 replication or to induce IFN-primed cell death in neurons. We found that DRG neurons required autophagy to limit HSV-1 replication both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, mucosal epithelial cells and other mitotic cells responded robustly to type I IFNs and did not require autophagy to control viral replication. These findings reveal a fundamental difference in the innate antiviral strategies employed by neurons and mitotic cells to control HSV-1 infection.

Abstract: Summary
Variation of surface adhesins, such as the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion ligand PfRh4, is critical for virulence and immune evasion in many microbes. While phenotypic switching is linked to transcriptional changes and chromatin function, the determinants of switching frequency remain poorly defined. By expressing a prokaryotic DNA methylase in P. falciparum, we directly assayed accessibility of transcriptionally active and silent chromatin at the PfRh4 locus. Parasites selected for in vivo PfRh4 activation show a reversible increase in promoter accessibility and exhibit perinuclear repositioning of the locus from a silent to a conserved activation domain. Forced activation of a proximal gene results in a similar repositioning of the PfRh4 locus, with a concomitant increase in PfRh4 activation in a subpopulation of parasites and promoter accessibility correlating with actively transcribed loci. Thus, nuclear repositioning is associated with increased P. falciparum switching frequency, while promoter accessibility is tightly linked to clonally active PfRh4 promoters.

Abstract: In this study, we characterized a putative peroxidase Prx1 of Candida albicans by: 1) demonstrating the thioredoxin-linked peroxidase activity with purified proteins, 2) examining the sensitivity to several oxidants and the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species with a null mutant (prx1Δ), a mutant (C69S) with a point mutation at Cys69, and a revertant, and 3) subcelluar localization. Enzymatic assays showed that Prx1 is a thioredoxin-linked peroxidase which reduces both hydrogen peroxide (H2B>O2) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH). Compared with two other strong H2O2 scavenger mutants for TSA1 and CAT1, prx1Δ and C69S were less sensitive to H2O2, menadione and diamide at all concentrations tested, but were more sensitive to low concentration of f-BOOH. Intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulated in prx1Δ and C69S cells treated with t-BOOH but not H2O2. These results suggest that peroxidase activity of Prx1 is specified to t-BOOH in cells. In both biochemical and physiological cases, the evolutionarily conserved Cys69 was found to be essential for the function. Immunocytochemical staining revealed Prx1 is localized in the cytosol of yeast cells, but is translocated to the nucleus during the hyphal transition, though the significances of this observation are unclear. Our data suggest that PRX1 has a thioredoxin peroxidase activity reducing both f-BOOH and H2O2, but its cellular function is specified to t-BOOH.

Abstract: Previous work from our laboratories demonstrated that the sugar-induced activation of plasma membrane H+-ATPase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is dependent on calcium metabolism with the contribution of calcium influx from external medium. Our results demonstrate that a glucose-induced calcium (GIC) transporter, a new and still unidentified calcium carrier, sensitive to nifedipine and gadolinium and activated by glucose addition, seems to be partially involved in the glucose-induced activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. On the other hand, the importance of calcium carriers that can release calcium from internal stores was analyzed in glucose-induced calcium signaling and activation of plasma membrane H+-ATPase, in experimental conditions presenting very low external calcium concentrations. Therefore the aim was also to investigate how the vacuole, through the participation of both Ca2+-ATPase Pmc1 and the TRP homologue calcium channel Yvc1 (respectively, encoded by the genes PMC1 and YVC1) contributes to control the intracellular calcium availability and the plasma membrane H+-ATPase activation in response to glucose. In strains presenting a single deletion in YVC1 gene or a double deletion in YVC1 and PMC1 genes, both glucose-induced calcium signaling and activation of the H+-ATPase are nearly abolished. These results suggest that Yvc1 calcium channel is an important component of this signal transduction pathway activated in response to glucose addition. We also found that by a still undefined mechanism Yvc1 activation seems to correlate with the changes in the intracellular level of IP3. Taken together, these data demonstrate that glucose addition to yeast cells exposed to low external calcium concentrations affects calcium uptake and the activity of the vacuolar calcium channel Yvc1, contributing to the occurrence of calcium signaling connected to plasma membrane H+-ATPase activation.

Abstract: Summary
Inner-ear hair cell differentiation requires Atoh1 function, while Eya1, Six1, and Sox2 are coexpressed in sensory progenitors and mutations in these genes cause sensorineural hearing loss. However, how these genes are linked functionally and the transcriptional networks controlling hair cell induction remain unclear. Here, we show (1) that Eya1/Six1 are necessary for hair cell development, and their coexpression in mouse cochlear explants is sufficient to induce hair cell fate in the nonsensory epithelium expressing low-level Sox2 by activating not only Atoh1-dependent but also Atoh1-independent pathways and (2) that both pathways induce Pou4f3 to promote hair cell differentiation. Sox2 cooperates with Eya1/Six1 to synergistically activate Atoh1 transcription via direct binding to the conserved Sox- and Six-binding sites in Atoh1 enhancers, and these proteins physically interact. Our findings demonstrate that direct and cooperative interactions between the Sox2, Six1, and Eya1 proteins coordinate Atoh1 expression to specify hair cell fate.

Abstract: The induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) elicits a plethora of responses that redirect many cellular functions to the vital task of repairing the injury, collectively known as the DNA damage response (DDR). We have found that, in the absence of DNA damage, the DSB repair factors RNF8 and BRCA1 are associated with the nucleolus. Shortly after exposure of cells to γ-radiation, RNF8 and BRCA1 translocated from the nucleolus to damage foci, a traffic that was reverted several hours after the damage. RNF8 interacted through its FHA domain with the ribosomal protein RPSA, and knockdown of RPSA caused a depletion of nucleolar RNF8 and BRCA1, suggesting that the interaction of RNF8 with RPSA is critical for the nucleolar localization of these DDR factors. Knockdown of RPSA or RNF8 impaired bulk protein translation, as did γ-irradiation, the latter being partially countered by overexpression of exogenous RNF8. Our results suggest that RNF8 and BRCA1 are anchored to the nucleolus through reversible interactions with RPSA and that, in addition to its known functions in DDR, RNF8 may play a role in protein synthesis, possibly linking the nucleolar exit of this factor to the attenuation of protein synthesis in response to DNA damage.

IL1β-mediated Stromal COX-2 signaling mediates proliferation and invasiveness of colonic epithelial cancer cells,

Abstract: COX-2 is a major inflammatory mediator implicated in colorectal inflammation and cancer. However, the exact origin and role of COX-2 on colorectal inflammation and carcinogenesis are still not well defined. Recently, we reported that COX-2 and iNOS signalings interact in colonic CCD18Co fibroblasts. In this article, we investigated whether activation of COX-2 signaling by IL1β in primary colonic fibroblasts obtained from normal and cancer patients play a critical role in regulation of proliferation and invasiveness of human colonic epithelial cancer cells. Our results demonstrated that COX-2 level was significantly higher in cancer associated fibroblasts than that in normal fibroblasts with or without stimulation of IL-1β, a powerful stimulator of COX-2. Using in vitro assays for estimating proliferative and invasive potential, we discovered that the proliferation and invasiveness of the epithelial cancer cells were much greater when the cells were co-cultured with cancer associated fibroblasts than with normal fibroblasts, with or without stimulation of IL1β. Further analysis indicated that the major COX-2 product, prostaglandin E2, directly enhanced proliferation and invasiveness of the epithelial cancer cells in the absence of fibroblasts. Moreover, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, blocked the proliferative and invasive effect of both normal and cancer associate fibroblasts on the epithelial cancer cells, with or without stimulation of IL-1β. Those results indicate that activation of COX-2 signaling in the fibroblasts plays a major role in promoting proliferation and invasiveness of the epithelial cancer cells. In this process, PKC is involved in the activation of COX-2 signaling induced by IL-1β in the fibroblasts.

Abstract: In vivo studies concerning the function of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are limited by relatively low levels of engraftment and the failure of the engrafted HSC preparations to differentiate into functional immune cells after systemic application. In the present paper we describe the effect of intrahepatically transplanted CD34+ cells from cord blood into the liver of newborn or adult NOD/SCID mice on organ engraftment and differentiation. Analyzing the short and long term time dependency of human cell recruitment into mouse organs after cell transplantation in the liver of newborn and adult NOD/SCID mice by RT-PCR and FACS analysis, a significantly high engraftment was found after transplantation into liver of newborn NOD/SCID mice compared to adult mice, with the highest level of 35% human cells in bone marrow and 4.9% human cells in spleen at day 70. These human cells showed CD19 B-cell, CD34 and CD38 hematopoietic and CD33 myeloid cell differentiation, but lacked any T-cell differentiation. HSC transplantation into liver of adult NOD/SCID mice resulted in minor recruitment of human cells from mouse liver to other mouse organs. The results indicate the usefulness of the intrahepatic application route into the liver of newborn NOD/SCID mice for the investigation of hematopoietic differentiation potential of CD34+ cord blood stem cell preparations.

Abstract: The cellular composition of the testicular capsule, seminiferous peritubular tissue, the epithelia as well as periductal muscle cell layers of the excurrent ducts was studied, in sexually mature and active Masked Weaver (Ploceus velatus) birds of the passerine family, Ploceidae. Ultrastructure of the contractile cells in the testicular capsule, peritubular and periductal tissues showed that these cells were smooth muscles of typical morphological characteristics. Variability in the immunohistochemical co-expression of microfilaments and intermediate filaments in the different tissues was evident. Actin and desmin proteins were co-expressed immunohistochemically in the testicular capsule and seminiferous peritubular smooth muscle layer. Actin was singly and very weakly expressed in the rete testis epithelium while cytokeratins and desmin were co-expressed in the epithelium of the excurrent ducts. The periductal muscle layer of all ducts of the epididymis, the ductus deferens as well as the seminal glomus, strongly co-expressed actin and desmin. Vimentin was absent in all cells and tissue types studied. There is clear evidence that the tissues of the male gonad and its excurrent ducts in the Masked Weaver, as has been reported for members of the Galloanserae and Ratitae, contain well-formed contractile tissues whose function would include the transportation of luminal through-flow from the testis into, and through, its excurrent ducts. The microtubule helix in the head and of the mid-piece, of elongating spermatids, as well as of the mature spermatozoa in the various excurrent ducts, including some spermatozoa in the seminal glomus, also co-expressed these three proteins.

Abstract: Calcium signatures induced by two elicitors of plant defense reactions, namely cryptogein and oligogalacturonides, were monitored at the subcellular level, using apoaequorin-transformed Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi cells, in which the apoaequorin calcium sensor was targeted either to cytosol, mitochondria or chloroplasts. Our study showed that both elicitors induced specific Ca2+ signatures in each compartment, with the most striking difference relying on duration. Common properties also emerged from the analysis of Ca2+ signatures: both elicitors induced a biphasic cytosolic [Ca2+] elevation together with a single mitochondrial [Ca2+] elevation concomitant with the first cytosolic [Ca2+] peak. In addition, both elicitors induced a chloroplastic [Ca2+] elevation peaking later in comparison to cytosolic [Ca2+] elevation. In cryptogein-treated cells, pharmacological studies indicated that IP3 should play an important role in Ca2+ signaling contrarily to cADPR or nitric oxide, which have limited or no effect on [Ca2+] variations. Our data also showed that, depending on [Ca2+] fluxes at the plasma membrane, cryptogein triggered a mitochondrial respiration increase and affected excess energy dissipation mechanisms in chloroplasts. Altogether the results indicate that cryptogein profoundly impacted cell functions at many levels, including organelles.

Abstract: Summary
Actin-based stress fiber formation is coupled to microtubule depolymerization through the local activation of RhoA. While the RhoGEF Lfc has been implicated in this cytoskeleton coupling process, it has remained elusive how Lfc is recruited to microtubules and how microtubule recruitment moderates Lfc activity. Here, we demonstrate that the dynein light chain protein Tctex-1 is required for localization of Lfc to microtubules. Lfc residues 139–161 interact with Tctex-1 at a site distinct from the cleft that binds dynein intermediate chain. An NMR-based GEF assay revealed that interaction with Tctex-1 represses Lfc nucleotide exchange activity in an indirect manner that requires both polymerized microtubules and phosphorylation of S885 by PKA. We show that inhibition of Lfc by Tctex-1 is dynein dependent. These studies demonstrate a pivotal role of Tctex-1 as a negative regulator of actin filament organization through its control of Lfc in the crosstalk between microtubule and actin cytoskeletons.

Abstract: We have previously isolated dieckol, a nutrient polyphenol compound, from the brown alga, Ecklonia cava (Lee et al., 2010a). Dieckol shows both antitumor and antioxidant activity and thus is of special interest for the development of chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents against cancer. However, the mechanism by which dieckol exerts its antitumor activity is poorly understood. Here, we show that dieckol, derived from E. cava, inhibits migration and invasion of HT1080 cells by scavenging intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). H2O2 or integrin signal-mediated ROS generation increases migration and invasion of HT1080 cells, which correlates with Rac1 activation and increased expression and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Rac1 activation is required for ROS generation. Depletion of FAK by siRNA suppresses Rac1-ROS-induced cell migration and invasion. Dieckol treatment attenuated intracellular ROS levels and activation of Rac1 as well as expression and phosphorylation of FAK. Dieckol treatment also decreases complex formation of FAK-Src-p130Cas and expression of MMP2, 9, and 13. These results suggest that the Racl-ROS-linked cascade enhances migration and invasion of HT1080 cells by inducing expression of MMPs through activation of the FAK signaling pathway, whereas dieckol downregulates FAK signaling through scavenging intracellular ROS. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms by which dieckol is able to suppress human cancer progresssion and metastasis. Therefore, we suggest that dieckol is a potential therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Salmonella Typhimurium specifically targets antigen-sampling microfold (M) cells to translocate across the gut epithelium. Although M cells represent a small proportion of the specialized follicular-associated epithelium (FAE) overlying mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, their density increases during Salmonella infection, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Using in vitro and in vivo infection models, we demonstrate that the S. Typhimurium type III effector protein SopB induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of FAE enterocytes into M cells. This cellular transdifferentiation is a result of SopB-dependent activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling leading to induction of both receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and its receptor RANK. The autocrine activation of RelB-expressing FAE enterocytes by RANKL/RANK induces the EMT-regulating transcription factor Slug that marks epithelial transdifferentiation into M cells. Thus, via the activity of a single secreted effector, S. Typhimurium transforms primed epithelial cells into M cells to promote host colonization and invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical gradients can generate pattern formation in biological systems. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a cortical gradient of pom1p (a DYRK-type protein kinase) functions to position sites of cytokinesis and cell polarity and to control cell length. Here, using quantitative imaging, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and mathematical modeling, we study how its gradient distribution is formed. Pom1p gradients exhibit large cell-to-cell variability, as well as dynamic fluctuations in each individual gradient. Our data lead to a two-state model for gradient formation in which pom1p molecules associate with the plasma membrane at cell tips and then diffuse on the membrane while aggregating into and fragmenting from clusters, before disassociating from the membrane. In contrast to a classical one-component gradient, this two-state gradient buffers against cell-to-cell variations in protein concentration. This buffering mechanism, together with time averaging to reduce intrinsic noise, allows the pom1p gradient to specify positional information in a robust manner.

Abstract: Summary
Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is a regulator of forebrain development that acts through its receptor, patched 1. However, little is known about cellular mechanisms at neurulation, whereby SHH from the prechordal plate governs specification of the rostral diencephalon ventral midline (RDVM), a major forebrain organizer. We identified LRP2, a member of the LDL receptor gene family, as a component of the SHH signaling machinery in the RDVM. LRP2 acts as an apical SHH-binding protein that sequesters SHH in its target field and controls internalization and cellular trafficking of SHH/patched 1 complexes. Lack of LRP2 in mice and in cephalic explants results in failure to respond to SHH, despite functional expression of patched 1 and smoothened, whereas overexpression of LRP2 variants in cells increases SHH signaling capacity. Our data identify a critical role for LRP2 in SHH signaling and reveal the molecular mechanism underlying forebrain anomalies in mice and patients with Lrp2 defects.

Abstract: Summary
Mediator complex is an integrative hub for transcriptional regulation. Here we show that Mediator regulates alternative mRNA processing via its MED23 subunit. Combining tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we identified a number of mRNA processing factors that bind to a soluble recombinant Mediator subunit, MED23, but not to several other Mediator components. One of these factors, hnRNP L, specifically interacts with MED23 in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, Mediator partially colocalizes with hnRNP L and the splicing machinery in the cell. Functionally, MED23 regulates a subset of hnRNP L-targeted alternative splicing (AS) and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) events, as shown by minigene reporters and exon array analysis. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that MED23 can regulate hnRNP L occupancy at their coregulated genes. Taken together, these results demonstrate a crosstalk between Mediator and the splicing machinery, providing a molecular basis for coupling mRNA processing to transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Several clinical studies have shown that insulin resistance is prevalent among patients with heart failure, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report a mechanism of insulin resistance associated with heart failure that involves upregulation of p53 in adipose tissue. We found that pressure overload markedly upregulated p53 expression in adipose tissue along with an increase of adipose tissue inflammation. Chronic pressure overload accelerated lipolysis in adipose tissue. In the presence of pressure overload, inhibition of lipolysis by sympathetic denervation significantly downregulated adipose p53 expression and inflammation, thereby improving insulin resistance. Likewise, disruption of p53 activation in adipose tissue attenuated inflammation and improved insulin resistance but also ameliorated cardiac dysfunction induced by chronic pressure overload. These results indicate that chronic pressure overload upregulates adipose tissue p53 by promoting lipolysis via the sympathetic nervous system, leading to an inflammatory response of adipose tissue and insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic stem cell (SSC) dysfunction is typical for different progeroid phenotypes in mice with genomic DNA repair defects. MtDNA mutagenesis in mice with defective Polg exonuclease activity also leads to progeroid symptoms, by an unknown mechanism. We found that Polg-Mutator mice had neural (NSC) and hematopoietic progenitor (HPC) dysfunction already from embryogenesis. NSC self-renewal was decreased in vitro, and quiescent NSC amounts were reduced in vivo. HPCs showed abnormal lineage differentiation leading to anemia and lymphopenia. N-acetyl-L-cysteine treatment rescued both NSC and HPC abnormalities, suggesting that subtle ROS/redox changes, induced by mtDNA mutagenesis, modulate SSC function. Our results show that mtDNA mutagenesis affected SSC function early but manifested as respiratory chain deficiency in nondividing tissues in old age. Deletor mice, having mtDNA deletions in postmitotic cells and no progeria, had normal SSCs. We propose that SSC compartment is sensitive to mtDNA mutagenesis, and that mitochondrial dysfunction in SSCs can underlie progeroid manifestations.

Abstract: The spermatodesms of Tylopsis liliifolia form in the most proximal follicular cysts and are composed of a large number of sperm held together by a cap located in the anterior region of the acrosome. The cap is formed by short thin fibrils, loosely arranged at random, probably derived from secretory activity of cells of the cyst wall. Compared to other Tettigoniidae, a peculiar feature is acrosomal wings that twist gradually around the anterior region of the nucleus; at the end of the twisting process, the region of the sperm acrosome, observed in cross section, shows a typical spiral form. Spermatodesms do not undergo any substantial changes in the spermiduct. The epithelial cells of the wall have secretory activity and many show marked spermiophagic activity, which is conducted by epithelial cell protrusions that envelop the gametes, taking them into the cytoplasm. When removed from seminal vesicles and observed in vivo, spermatodesms show accentuated corkscrew movement, and when observed by SEM, slight torsion. Thus organized, spermatodesms are transferred to the spermatophore during mating, where they are transformed before reaching the seminal receptacle.

Abstract: Summary
The 26S proteasome plays a fundamental role in eukaryotic homeostasis by undertaking the highly controlled degradation of a wide range of proteins, including key cellular regulators such as those controlling cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. Here we report the structure of the human 26S proteasome determined by cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle analysis, with secondary structure elements identified both in the 20S proteolytic core region and in the 19S regulatory particle. We have used this information together with crystal structures, homology models, and other biochemical information to construct a molecular model of the complete 26S proteasome. This model allows for a detailed description of the 20S core within the 26S proteasome and redefines the overall assignment of subunits within the 19S regulatory particle. The information presented here provides a strong basis for a mechanistic understanding of the 26S proteasome.

Abstract: The monoclonal antibody C225 (Cetuximab) blocks binding of ligand to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In addition, it is known that incubation with C225 induces endocytosis of the EGFR. This endocytosis has previously been shown to be increased when C225 is combined with an additional monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody. However, the effects of antibody combinations on EGFR activation, endocytosis, trafficking and degradation have been unclear. By binding a secondary antibody to the C225-EGFR complex, we here demonstrate that a combination of antibodies can efficiently internalize and degrade the EGFR. Although the combination of antibodies activated the EGFR kinase and induced ubiquitination of the EGFR, the kinase activity was not required for internalization of the EGFR. In contrast to EGF-induced EGFR down-regulation, the antibody combination efficiently degraded the EGFR without initiating downstream proliferative signaling. The antibody-induced internalization of EGFR was found not to depend on clathrin and/or dynamin, but depended on actin polymerization, suggesting induction of macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis may cause internalization of large membrane areas, and this could explain the highly efficient internalization of the EGFR induced by combination of antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
DNA double-strand break (DSB) signaling and repair are critical for cell viability, and rely on highly coordinated pathways whose molecular organization is still incompletely understood. Here, we show that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like (hnRNPUL) proteins 1 and 2 play key roles in cellular responses to DSBs. We identify human hnRNPUL1 and -2 as binding partners for the DSB sensor complex MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) and demonstrate that hnRNPUL1 and -2 are recruited to DNA damage in an interdependent manner that requires MRN. Moreover, we show that hnRNPUL1 and -2 stimulate DNA-end resection and promote ATR-dependent signaling and DSB repair by homologous recombination, thereby contributing to cell survival upon exposure to DSB-inducing agents. Finally, we establish that hnRNPUL1 and -2 function downstream of MRN and CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP) to promote recruitment of the BLM helicase to DNA breaks. Collectively, these results provide insights into how mammalian cells respond to DSBs.

Sustained Generation of Nitric Oxide and Control of Mycobacterial Infection Requires Argininosuccinate Synthase 1,

Abstract: Summary
Nitric oxide (NO) defends against intracellular pathogens, but its synthesis must be regulated due to cell and tissue toxicity. During infection, macrophages import extracellular arginine to synthesize NO, generating the byproduct citrulline. Accumulated intracellular citrulline is thought to fuel arginine synthesis catalyzed by argininosuccinate synthase (Ass1) and argininosuccinate lyase (Asl), which would lead to abundant NO production. Instead, we find that citrulline is exported from macrophages during early stages of NO production with <2% retained for recycling via the Ass1-Asl pathway. Later, extracellular arginine is depleted, and Ass1 expression allows macrophages to synthesize arginine from imported citrulline to sustain NO output. Ass1-deficient macrophages fail to salvage citrulline in arginine-scarce conditions, leading to their inability to control mycobacteria infection. Thus, extracellular arginine fuels rapid NO production in activated macrophages, and citrulline recycling via Ass1 and Asl is a fail-safe system that sustains optimum NO production.

Abstract: Nicotine, a major component of cigarette smoking, is the important risk factor for the development of periodontal disease. However, the mechanisms that underlie the cytotoxicity of nicotine in human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) are largely unknown. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the cytotoxic effect of nicotine by means of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activation in PDLSCs. We first detected α7 and β4 nAChRs in PDLSCs. The gene expressions of α7 and β4 nAChR were increased by nicotine administration. Nicotine significantly decreased cell viability at a concentration higher than 10-5 M. DNA fragmentation was also detected at high doses of nicotine treatment. Moreover, the detection of sub G1 phase and TUNEL assay demonstrated that nicotine significantly induced apoptotic cell death at 10-2 M concentration. Western blot analysis confirmed that p53 proteins were phosphorylated by nicotine. Under various doses of nicotine, a decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, but an increase in p53 and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels, was detected in a dose-dependent manner. However, the apoptotic effect of nicotine was inhibited by the pretreatment of α-bungarotoxin, a selective α7 nAChR antagonist or mecamylamine, a non-selective nAChR antagonist. Finally, increases in the subG1 phase and DNA fragmentation by nicotine was attenuated by each nAChR antagonist. Collectively, the presence of α7 and β4 nAChRs in PDLSCs supports a key role of nAChRs in the modulation of nicotine-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
For proliferation, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum needs to modify the infected host cell extensively. To achieve this, the parasite exports proteins containing a Plasmodium export element (PEXEL) into the host cell. Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate binding and cleavage of the PEXEL are thought to mediate protein export. We show that these requirements can be bypassed, exposing a second level of export control in the N terminus generated after PEXEL cleavage that is sufficient to distinguish exported from nonexported proteins. Furthermore, this region also corresponds to the export domain of a second group of exported proteins lacking PEXELs (PNEPs), indicating shared export properties among different exported parasite proteins. Concordantly, export of both PNEPs and PEXEL proteins depends on unfolding, revealing translocation as a common step in export. However, translocation of transmembrane proteins occurs at the parasite plasma membrane, one step before translocation of soluble proteins, indicating unexpectedly complex translocation events at the parasite periphery.

Abstract: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) results from immunemediated attacks on recipient tissues by donor-originated cells through the recognition of incompatible antigens expressed on host cells. The pre-conditioning irradiation dose is a risk factor influencing GVHD severity. In this study, using newly generated luciferase transgenic mice on a B6 background (B6.LucTg) as bone marrow and splenocyte donors, we explored the effects of irradiation doses on donor cell dynamics in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched allogeneic GVHD hosts via bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Results from BLI of GVHD hosts showed higher emission intensities of luminescence signals from hosts irradiated with 900 cGy as compared with those irradiated with 400 cGy. In particular, BLI signals from target organs, such as the spleen, liver, and lung, and several different lymph nodes fluctuated with similar time kinetics soon after transplantation, reflecting the synchronous proliferation of donor cells in the different organs in hosts irradiated with 900 cGy. The kinetic curves of the BLI signals were not synchronized between the target organs and the secondary organs in hosts irradiated with 400 cGy. These results demonstrate that pre-conditioning doses influence the kinetics and degree of proliferation in the target organs soon after transplantation. The results from this study are the first describing donor cell dynamics in MHC-matched allogeneic GVHD hosts and the influence of irradiation doses on proliferation dynamics, and will provide spatiotemporal information to help understand GVHD pathophysiology.

Abstract: The glucoregulatory hormones insulin and glucagon are released from the β- and α-cells of the pancreatic islets. In both cell types, secretion is secondary to firing of action potentials, Ca2+-influx via voltage-gated Ca2+-channels, elevation of [Ca2+]i and initiation of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Here we discuss the mechanisms that underlie the reciprocal regulation of insulin and glucagon secretion by changes in plasma glucose, the roles played by different types of voltage-gated Ca2+-channel present in α- and β-cells and the modulation of hormone secretion by Ca2+-dependent and -independent processes. We also consider how subtle changes in Ca2+-signalling may have profound impact on β-cell performance and increase risk of developing type-2 diabetes.

Abstract: Herein, we propose that viral infection can induce a deficient cell stress response and thereby impairs stress tolerance and makes tissues vulnerable to damage. Having a valid paradigm to address the pathological impacts of viral infections could lead to effective new therapies for diseases that have previously been unresponsive to intervention. Host response to viral infections can also lead to autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes. In the case of Newcastle disease virus, the effects of viral infection on heat shock proteins may be leveraged as a therapy for cancer. Finally, the search for a specific virus being responsible for a condition like chronic fatigue syndrome may not be worthwhile if the disease is simply a nonspecific response to viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
During their egress, newly assembled vaccinia virus particles fuse with the plasma membrane and enhance their spread by inducing Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization. Investigating the events surrounding vaccinia virus fusion, we discovered that vaccinia transiently recruits clathrin in a manner dependent on the clathrin adaptor AP-2. The recruitment of clathrin to vaccinia dramatically enhances the ability of the virus to induce actin-based motility. We demonstrate that clathrin promotes clustering of the virus actin tail nucleator A36 and host N-WASP, which activates actin nucleation through the Arp2/3 complex. Increased clustering enhances N-WASP stability, leading to more efficient actin tail initiation and sustained actin polymerization. Our observations uncover an unexpected role for clathrin during virus spread and have important implications for the regulation of actin polymerization.

Abstract: Summary
RNA viruses exist as dynamic and diverse populations shaped by constant mutation and selection. Yet little is known about how the mutant spectrum contributes to virus evolvability and pathogenesis. Because several codon choices are available for a given amino acid, a central question concerns whether viral sequences have evolved to optimize not only the protein coding consensus, but also the DNA/RNA sequences accessible through mutation. Here we directly test this hypothesis by comparing wild-type poliovirus to synthetic viruses carrying re-engineered capsid sequences with hundreds of synonymous mutations. Strikingly, such rewiring of the population’s mutant network reduced its robustness and attenuated the virus in an animal model of infection. We conclude that the position of a virus in sequence space defines its mutant spectrum, evolutionary trajectory, and pathogenicity.

Abstract: Summary
The Ska complex is an essential mitotic component required for accurate cell division in human cells. It is composed of three subunits that function together to establish stable kinetochore-microtubule interactions in concert with the Ndc80 network. We show that the structure of the Ska core complex is a W-shaped dimer of coiled coils, formed by intertwined interactions between Ska1, Ska2, and Ska3. The C-terminal domains of Ska1 and Ska3 protrude at each end of the homodimer, bind microtubules in vitro when connected to the central core, and are essential in vivo. Mutations disrupting the central coiled coil or the dimerization interface result in chromosome congression failure followed by cell death. The Ska complex is thus endowed with bipartite and cooperative tubulin-binding properties at the ends of a 350 Å-long molecule. We discuss how this symmetric architecture might complement and stabilize the Ndc80-microtubule attachments with analogies to the yeast Dam1/DASH complex.

Abstract: In oligodendrogliomas, 1p loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a predictor of good prognosis and treatment response. In contrast, in uveal melanomas, LOH of chromosome 3 has been linked to poor prognosis and downregulation of Hsp27. In the present study, we have analyzed the expression of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) to characterize subtypes of gliomas and their histopathologic features and to correlate with other molecular markers including LOH of 1p. Biopsies from patients with primary gliomas (n = 65) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, chromogenic in situ hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization and methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Elevated Hsp27 and total Hsp70 expression levels were associated with high-grade astrocytomas (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01, respectively). In grade III oligodendrogliomas, the Hsp27 levels were significantly higher (p = 0.03). Low O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression was associated with grade II astrocytomas. Elevated β-catenin expression was associated with grade III/IV astrocytomas (p = 0.003); p53 (+) tumors were more frequently found in grade III/IV astrocytomas (p = 0,001). LOH on 1p was associated with oligodendroglial tumours. In addition, a higher Hsp27 expression correlated with LOH of 1p (p = 0.017); this was also tested in two glioma cell lines. MSP was successful in only six samples. No significant correlations were found for the other markers. In conclusion, in oligodendroglial tumors, Hsp27 appeared as a surrogate marker of LOH of 1p which could also help to predict the disease prognosis. In gliomas, p53, Hsp27, Hsp70, MGMT, and β-catenin correlated with histopathological characteristics, suggesting that these markers could predict the disease outcome and the response to treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms through which long intergenic noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) exert regulatory effects on eukaryotic biological processes remain largely elusive. Most studies of these phenomena rely on methods that measure average behaviors in cell populations, lacking resolution to observe the effects of ncRNA transcription on gene expression in a single cell. Here, we combine quantitative single-molecule RNA FISH experiments with yeast genetics and computational modeling to gain mechanistic insights into the regulation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein-coding gene FLO11 by two intergenic ncRNAs, ICR1 and PWR1. Direct detection of FLO11 mRNA and these ncRNAs in thousands of individual cells revealed alternative expression states and provides evidence that ICR1 and PWR1 contribute to FLO11's variegated transcription, resulting in Flo11-dependent phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal cell populations by modulating recruitment of key transcription factors to the FLO11 promoter.

Abstract: Summary
A major obstacle in analyzing gene function in apicomplexan parasites is the absence of a practical regulatable expression system. Here, we identified functional transcriptional activation domains within Apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2) family transcription factors. These ApiAP2 transactivation domains were validated in blood-, liver-, and mosquito-stage parasites and used to create a robust conditional expression system for stage-specific, tetracycline-dependent gene regulation in Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium berghei, and Plasmodium falciparum. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we created conditional knockdowns of two essential P. berghei genes: profilin (PRF), a protein implicated in parasite invasion, and N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), which catalyzes protein acylation. Tetracycline-induced repression of PRF and NMT expression resulted in a dramatic reduction in parasite viability. This efficient regulatable system will allow for the functional characterization of essential proteins that are found in these important parasites.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) play an important role in the cellular defense of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms against a variety of internal and external stressors. In this study, a cDNA clone encoding a member of the α-crystallin/sHSP family, termed AccHsp27.6, was isolated from Apis cerana cerana. The full-length cDNA is 1,014 bp in length and contains a 708-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 236 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 27.6 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.53. Seven putative heat shock elements and three NF-κB binding sites were present in the 5′-flanking region, suggesting a possible function in immunity. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that AccHsp27.6 was expressed in all tested tissues and at different developmental stages. Furthermore, expression of the AccHsp27.6 transcript was induced by exposure to heat shock, H2O2, a number of different chemicals (including SO2, formaldehyde, alcohol, acetone, chloroform, and the pesticides phoxime and acetamiprid), and the microbes Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. In contrast, the mRNA expression could be repressed by CO2, the pesticides pyriproxyfen and cyhalothrin, and the microbes Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Notably, the recombinant AccHsp27.6 protein exhibited significant in vitro molecular chaperone activity and antimicrobial activity. Taken together, these results suggest that AccHsp27.6 might play an important role in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses and in immune reactions.

Abstract: The pulsatile secretion of hormones from the mammalian pituitary gland drives a wide range of homeostatic responses by dynamically altering the functional set-point of effector tissues. To accomplish this, endocrine cell populations residing within the intact pituitary display large-scale changes in coordinated calcium-spiking activity in response to various hypothalamic and peripheral inputs. Although the pituitary gland is structurally compartmentalized into specific and intermingled endocrine cell networks, providing a clear morphological basis for such coordinated activity, the mechanisms which facilitate the timely propagation of information between cells in situ remain largely unexplored. Therefore, the aim of the current review is to highlight the range of signalling modalities known to be employed by endocrine cells to coordinate intracellular calcium rises, and discuss how these mechanisms are integrated at the population level to orchestrate cell function and tissue output.

Abstract: There are some evidences for suggesting that adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) can be differentiated to the fate of neural cell type. ADSCs can be expanded rapidly in vitro and can be obtained by a less invasive method. In this study, we attempted to compare the stability of neural differentiation in human ADSCs by using two induction protocols. Isolated ADSCs were induced into neural-like cells using diverse effects of two specific procedures. For protocol 1, ADSCs were induced by chemical induction. In protocol 2, ADSCs were treated for sphere formation. Then, the singled cells were cultured in neurobasal media supplemented with special components. Differentiated ADSCs were evaluated for Nestin, MAP2 and GFAP expression by immunocytochemistry and semi quantitative RT-PCR techniques. Moreover, MTT assay was employed to detect cell viability and proliferation. Immunocytochemical analysis of both protocols demonstrated that ADSCs had large expression of the neural-specific markers. In RT-PCR, protocol 1 showed the highest percentage of MAP2 expression, but with time passing, the neural like state was reversible. Protocol 2 found with express of Nestin at week 1, however MAP2 and GFAP expression increased after 3weeks. The neural-like cells produced by protocol 1 led to the further cell death. Comparative analysis showed that neural-like cell differentiation of ADSCs in chemical induction protocol was rapid but transitory, while it was approximately steady in neurosphere formation protocol.

Abstract: Summary
Cells commit to mitosis by abruptly activating the mitotic cyclin-Cdk complexes. During Drosophila gastrulation, mitosis is associated with the transcriptional activation of cdc25string, a phosphatase that activates Cdk1. Here, we demonstrate that the switch-like entry into mitosis observed in the Drosophila embryo during the 14th mitotic cycle is timed by the dynamics of Cdc25string accumulation. The switch operates as a short-term integrator, a property that can improve the reliable control of timing of mitosis. The switch is independent of the positive feedback between Cdk1 and Cdc25string and of the double negative feedback between Cdk1 and Wee1. We propose that the properties of the mitotic switch are established by the out-of-equilibrium properties of the covalent modification cycle controlling Cdk1 activity. Such covalent modification cycles, triggered by transcriptional expression of the activating enzymes, might be a widespread strategy to obtain reliable and switch-like control of cell decisions.

Abstract: Inflammatory mediators including inducible nitric oxide (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) contribute to the course of a variety of inflammatory diseases. S632A3 is a new member of the glutarimide antibiotics isolated from a cultured broth of Streptomyces hygroscopicus S632 with a potent NF-κB inhibitory activity. In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects and the underlying molecular mechanism of S632A3 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. S632A3 concentration-dependently inhibited LPS-induced NO and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production through the suppression of iNOS and COX-2 at gene transcription levels. In addition, S632A3 suppressed NF-κB-dependent inflammatory responses by inhibiting the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), while the activation of IκB kinase (IKK) complex was unaffected. S632A3 suppressed NF-κB activity by differentially affecting the CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and NF-κB p65 interacting with the coactivator CBP (CREB binding protein). S632A3 also inhibited GSK-3β-elicited iNOS and COX-2 expression. Moreover, S632A3 was shown to inhibit the activation of ASK1 (Apoptosis-signal regulating kinase 1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, therefore attenuated the LPS-induced NF-κB activity in macrophages. Furthermore, S632A3 significantly reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 production while increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Our study thus provides a molecular mechanism by which S632A3 inhibited LPS-induced pro-inflammatory response in macrophages through interfering with the activation of GSK-3β and ASK1-p38 signaling.
