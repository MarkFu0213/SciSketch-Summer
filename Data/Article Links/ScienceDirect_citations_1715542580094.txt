Abstract: Summary
Immune agonist antibodies (IAAs) are promising immunotherapies that target co-stimulatory receptors to induce potent anti-tumor immune responses, particularly when combined with checkpoint inhibitors. Unfortunately, their clinical translation is hampered by serious dose-limiting, immune-mediated toxicities, including high-grade and sometimes fatal liver damage, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and colitis. We show that the immunotoxicity, induced by the IAAs anti-CD40 and anti-CD137, is dependent on the gut microbiota. Germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice have significantly reduced colitis, CRS, and liver damage following IAA treatment compared with conventional mice or germ-free mice recolonized via fecal microbiota transplant. MyD88 signaling is required for IAA-induced CRS and for anti-CD137-induced, but not anti-CD40-induced, liver damage. Importantly, antibiotic treatment does not impair IAA anti-tumor efficacy, alone or in combination with anti-PD1. Our results suggest that microbiota-targeted therapies could overcome the toxicity induced by IAAs without impairing their anti-tumor activity.

Abstract: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a common minimally invasive treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Incomplete RFA (iRFA) due to the sub-lethal heat shock challenge of some cell populations leads to the generation of transformed survivor cells with enhanced chemoresistance. However, the underlying mechanism of iRFA on HCCs chemoresistance remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effect of iRFA on HCCs sensitivity to cisplatin. Cells treated with the sub-lethal heat shock challenge were used to mimic iRFA treatment in vitro. An orthotopic implantation HCC model was established and also performed iRFA treatment. Flow cytometry, transwell assay, and cell counting kit-8 assay were used to determine the effect of iRFA treatment on cisplatin-induced HCC cell apoptosis, invasion, and cell viability. ELISA and Western blot were used to detect the effect of iRFA treatment on cisplatin-induced HCC cell pyroptosis. We found that iRFA treatment increased the HCC cell proliferation and invasion ability, and inhibited cisplatin-induced pyroptosis. Further experiments showed that iRFA treatment induced upregulation of HSP70, which inhibited the cisplatin-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to inhibition of pyroptosis. HSP70 knockdown or NLRP3 overexpression could reverse the effect of iRFA treatment in vitro. In vivo, HSP70 knockdown reversed the chemosensitivity of HCC to cisplatin, which was decreased by iRFA. In conclusion, we demonstrated that iRFA induced drug resistance by HSP70-mediated inhibition of cell pyroptosis in HCC.

Abstract: Some years ago, our group reported the presence of the female prostate in all the studied females of the plains viscacha (Lagostomus maximus). The goal of the present study was to characterize and compare the female prostate gland between adult pregnant and non-pregnant plains viscacha using histochemical, lectin-histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques, as well as optic and electron microscopy. Structurally, alveoli are lined by a simple epithelium formed by different cell types: basal cells, secretory cells in different stages of the secretory cycle and cells of clear cytoplasm. Secretory cells are the most abundant cell type, differing between them depending on the quantity and electron-density of their granules. The basal cells are less abundant and are responsible for the renewal of the alveolar epithelium. Likewise, other cells with secretory morphology were found in all the studied females; these have a clear cytoplasm, few granules and mitochondria. It could be considered that they are degranulated secretory cells or that they have partially released their granules. The stroma of the organ is formed by connective tissue and smooth muscle fibers, which are immunohistochemically evidenced against desmin. Histochemical and lectin-histochemical analysis revealed the presence of different glucidic residues in the different cell types. No structural, histochemical, lectin-histochemical, and ultrastructural differences were observed between pregnant and non-pregnant females of plain viscachas, except for the expression of some lectins. The paraurethral gland of Lagostomus maximus can be used as a model for studying the gland in other species since its structural and ultrastructural characteristics do not depend on the hormonal status of the female.

Abstract: Summary
Developing new influenza vaccines with improved performance and easier administration routes hinges on defining correlates of protection. Vaccine-elicited cellular correlates of protection for influenza in humans have not yet been demonstrated. A phase-2 double-blind randomized placebo and active (inactivated influenza vaccine) controlled study provides evidence that a human-adenovirus-5-based oral influenza vaccine tablet (VXA-A1.1) can protect from H1N1 virus challenge in humans. Mass cytometry characterization of vaccine-elicited cellular immune responses identified shared and vaccine-type-specific responses across B and T cells. For VXA-A1.1, the abundance of hemagglutinin-specific plasmablasts and plasmablasts positive for integrin α4β7, phosphorylated STAT5, or lacking expression of CD62L at day 8 were significantly correlated with protection from developing viral shedding following virus challenge at day 90 and contributed to an effective machine learning model of protection. These findings reveal the characteristics of vaccine-elicited cellular correlates of protection for an oral influenza vaccine.

Abstract: Summary
Proteins interacting with ADP-ribosyl groups are often involved in disease-related pathways or viral infections, making them attractive drug targets. We present a robust and accessible assay applicable to both hydrolyzing or non-hydrolyzing binders of mono- and poly-ADP-ribosyl groups. This technology relies on a C-terminal tag based on a Gi protein alpha subunit peptide (GAP), which allows for site-specific introduction of cysteine-linked mono- and poly-ADP-ribosyl groups or analogs. By fusing the GAP-tag and ADP-ribosyl binders to fluorescent proteins, we generate robust FRET partners and confirm the interaction with 22 known ADP-ribosyl binders. The applicability for high-throughput screening of inhibitors is demonstrated with the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 macrodomain, for which we identify suramin as a moderate-affinity yet non-specific inhibitor. High-affinity ADP-ribosyl binders fused to nanoluciferase complement this technology, enabling simple blot-based detection of ADP-ribosylated proteins. All these tools can be produced in Escherichia coli and will help in ADP-ribosylation research and drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
For those people with cystic fibrosis carrying rare CFTR mutations not responding to currently available therapies, there is an unmet need for relevant tissue models for therapy development. Here, we describe a new testing platform that employs patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated to lung progenitor cells that can be studied using a dynamic, high-throughput fluorescence-based assay of CFTR channel activity. Our proof-of-concept studies support the potential use of this platform, together with a Canadian bioresource that contains iPSC lines and matched nasal cultures from people with rare mutations, to advance patient-oriented therapy development. Interventions identified in the high-throughput, stem cell-based model and validated in primary nasal cultures from the same person have the potential to be advanced as therapies.

Abstract: It is urgent to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets to ameliorate the clinical prognosis of patients with lung cancer. The functional significance and molecular mechanism of dynein cytoplasmic 1 heavy chain 1 (DYNC1H1) in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression is still elusive. In our current study, publicly available data and Western blotting experiments confirmed that DYNC1H1 expression was upregulated in lung cancer samples compared with noncancerous samples. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) results indicated that high DYNC1H1 expression in lung cancer tissues was significantly associated with clinical tumor stage and distal metastasis; moreover, its high expression was negatively correlated with prognosis. Functional experiments demonstrated that DYNC1H1 loss of function caused a significant decrease in cell viability and cell proliferative ability, inhibition of the cell cycle, and promotion of both migration potential and invasion potential in vitro. Animal experiments by tail vein injection of lung cancer cells showed that DYNC1H1 knockdown significantly decreased lung cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, the results from a human protein array showed changes in the IFN-γ-JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) immune data demonstrated that disturbance of the immune microenvironment might be involved in the impaired growth and metastatic ability mediated by DYNC1H1 loss in NSCLC. DYNC1H1 might serve as a promising biological marker of prognosis and a potential clinical therapeutic target for patients with NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
One major challenge in realizing cell-based therapy for treating muscle-wasting disorders is the difficulty in obtaining therapeutically meaningful amounts of engraftable cells. We have previously described a method to generate skeletal myogenic progenitors with exceptional engraftability from pluripotent stem cells via teratoma formation. Here, we show that these cells are functionally expandable in vitro while retaining their in vivo regenerative potential. Within 37 days in culture, teratoma-derived skeletal myogenic progenitors were expandable to a billion-fold. Similar to their freshly sorted counterparts, the expanded cells expressed PAX7 and were capable of forming multinucleated myotubes in vitro. Importantly, these cells remained highly regenerative in vivo. Upon transplantation, the expanded cells formed new DYSTROPHIN+ fibers that reconstituted up to 40% of tibialis anterior muscle volume and repopulated the muscle stem cell pool. Our study thereby demonstrates the possibility of producing large quantities of engraftable skeletal myogenic cells for transplantation.

Abstract: The chaperonin containing tailless complex polypeptide 1 (CCT) is a multi-subunit molecular chaperone. It is found in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells, where the oligomeric form plays an essential role in the folding of predominantly the cytoskeletal proteins actin and tubulin. Both the CCT oligomer and monomeric subunits also display functions that extend beyond folding, which are often associated with microtubules and actin filaments. Here, we assess the functional significance of the CCTδ V390F mutation, reported in several cancer cell lines. Upon transfection into B16F1 mouse melanoma cells, GFP-CCTδV390F incorporates into the CCT oligomer more readily than GFP-CCTδ. Furthermore, unlike GFP-CCTδ, GFP-CCTδV390F does not interact with the dynactin complex component, p150Glued. As CCTδ has previously been implicated in altered migration in wound healing assays, we assessed the behaviour of GFP-CCTδV390F and other mutants of CCTδ, previously used to assess functional interactions with p150Glued, in chemotaxis assays. We developed the assay system to incorporate a layer of the inert hydrogel GrowDex® to provide a 3D matrix for chemotaxis assessment and found subtle differences in the migration of B16F1 cells, depending on the presence of the hydrogel.

Abstract: LncRNA contribution to self-renewal of bladder cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) remains largely unknown. We investigated the expression profile and biological function of lncRNAs in urothelial CSLCs by microarray analysis. Among these, lncRNA-AK023096 was identified as potentially playing a role in maintaining self-renewal of CSLCs. Knockdown of this transcript inhibited spheroid formation and tumor formation. We found that AK023096 mediates recruitment of hnRNP-K to SOX2 promoter and increases H3K4 trimethylation status on SOX2 promoter, leading to a robust change in SOX2 mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, AK023096 expression in primary tumors was found to be a powerful predictor of recurrence following transurethral resection in patients with nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer, highlighting the critical role of lncRNA in the bladder cancer regulatory network.

Abstract: Summary
Laboratory mice comprise an expeditious model for preclinical vaccine testing; however, vaccine immunogenicity in these models often inadequately translates to humans. Reconstituting physiologic microbial experience to specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice induces durable immunological changes that better recapitulate human immunity. We examined whether mice with diverse microbial experience better model human responses post vaccination. We co-housed laboratory mice with pet-store mice, which have varied microbial exposures, and then assessed immune responses to influenza vaccines. Human transcriptional responses to influenza vaccination are better recapitulated in co-housed mice. Although SPF and co-housed mice were comparably susceptible to acute influenza infection, vaccine-induced humoral responses were dampened in co-housed mice, resulting in poor control upon challenge. Additionally, protective heterosubtypic T cell immunity was compromised in co-housed mice. Because SPF mice exaggerated humoral and T cell protection upon influenza vaccination, reconstituting microbial experience in laboratory mice through co-housing may better inform preclinical vaccine testing.

Abstract: Summary
It remains a challenge to decipher the complex relationship between DNA methylation, histone modification, and the underlying DNA sequence with limited input material. Here, we developed an efficient, low-input, and low-cost method for the simultaneous profiling of genomic localization of histone modification and methylation status of the underlying DNA at single-base resolution from the same cells in a single experiment by integrating cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) with tagmentation-based bisulfite sequencing (CUT&Tag-BS). We demonstrated the validity of our method using representative histone modifications of euchromatin and constitutive and facultative heterochromatin (H3K4me1, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3, respectively). Similar histone modification enrichment patterns were observed in CUT&Tag-BS compared with non-bisulfite-treated control, and H3K4me1-marked regions were found to mostly be CpG poor, lack methylation concordance, and exhibit prevalent DNA methylation heterogeneity among mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We anticipate that CUT&Tag-BS will be widely applied to directly address the genomic relationship between DNA methylation and histone modification, especially in low-input scenarios with precious biological samples.

Abstract: Objective
The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing yearly and CRC patients are becoming younger in global. Evidences have revealed the carcinogenic effect of p53 and DNA damage-regulated gene 1 (PDRG1) in several types of tumors. However, its biological function is yet to be investigated in CRC. This study aimed to unveil the prooncogenic role of PDRG1 in CRC.
Methods
We detected the expression and clinical pathological features of PDRG1 in CRC tissues and paired non-tumor adjacent tissues. The biological role and molecular mechanism of PDRG1 in CRC were characterized through a range of in vitro and in vivo experiments and datasets analysis.
Result
We identified the significant up-regulated expression of PDRG1 both in CRC tissues and cell, and higher expression of PDRG1 was associated with worse clinicopathological stage and poorer survival outcome. Cox regression analysis revealed that PDRG1 is an independent prognostic factor for CRC patients. Silencing of PDRG1 significantly retarded CRC cell vitality, invasion and migration, induced cell apoptosis and G0/G1 phase arrest. PDRG1 knockdown also attenuated tumor growth and metastasis as evidencing in vivo experiment. The expression of p21 and apoptosis related protein was enhanced with the knockdown of PDRG1 while cell cycle protein was inhibited.
Conclusion
PDRG1 function as a novel oncogene and participate in malignant progression of CRC by regulating p21-mediated signal pathway, suggesting that it can serve as a valuable predictive biomarker for diagnosing of CRC patient and a promising target for therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) allow in vitro study of genetic diseases and hold potential for personalized stem cell therapy. Gene editing, precisely modifying specifically targeted loci, represents a valuable tool for different hiPSC applications. This is especially useful in monogenic diseases to dissect the function of unknown mutations or to create genetically corrected, patient-derived hiPSCs. Here we describe a highly efficient method for simultaneous base editing and reprogramming of fibroblasts employing a CRISPR-Cas9 adenine base editor. As a proof of concept, we apply this approach to generate gene-edited hiPSCs from skin biopsies of four patients carrying a Finnish-founder pathogenic point mutation in either NOTCH3 or LDLR genes. We also show LDLR activity restoration after the gene correction. Overall, this method yields tens of gene-edited hiPSC monoclonal lines with unprecedented efficiency and robustness while considerably reducing the cell culture time and thus the risk for in vitro alterations.

Abstract: M2 macrophages are crucial components of the tumour microenvironment and have been shown to be closely related to tumour progression. Co-culture with 4.1R−/− M2 macrophages enhances the malignancy of colon cancer (CC), but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that protein 4.1R knockout reduced the phagocytosis of M2 macrophages (M-CSF/IL-4-treated bone marrow cells) and promoted MC38 colon cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, tumour formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which are regulated by M2 macrophages. Further mechanistic dissection revealed that the 4.1R knockout upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) secreted by M2 macrophages and promoted colon cancer progression by activating the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. In summary, our present study identified that 4.1R downregulates VEGFA secretion in M2 macrophages and delays the malignant potential of colon cancer by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding cell recruitment in damaged tendons is critical for improvements in regenerative therapy. We recently reported that targeted disruption of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) type II receptor in the tendon cell lineage (Tgfbr2ScxCre) resulted in resident tenocyte dedifferentiation and tendon deterioration in postnatal stages. Here we extend the analysis and identify direct recruitment of stem/progenitor cells into the degenerative mutant tendons. Cre-mediated lineage tracing indicates that these cells are not derived from tendon-ensheathing tissues or from a Scleraxis-expressing lineage, and they turned on tendon markers only upon entering the mutant tendons. Through immunohistochemistry and inducible gene deletion, we further find that the recruited cells originated from a Sox9-expressing lineage and their recruitment was dependent on cell autonomous TGFβ signaling. The cells identified in this study thus differ from previous reports of cell recruitment into injured tendons and suggest a critical role for TGFβ signaling in cell recruitment, providing insights that may support improvements in tendon repair.

Abstract: Summary
We identify an intronic deletion in VANGL1 that predisposes to renal injury in high risk populations through a kidney-intrinsic process. Half of all SLE patients develop nephritis, yet the predisposing mechanisms to kidney damage remain poorly understood. There is limited evidence of genetic contribution to specific organ involvement in SLE.1,2 We identify a large deletion in intron 7 of Van Gogh Like 1 (VANGL1), which associates with nephritis in SLE patients. The same deletion occurs at increased frequency in an indigenous population (Tiwi Islanders) with 10-fold higher rates of kidney disease compared with non-indigenous populations. Vangl1 hemizygosity in mice results in spontaneous IgA and IgG deposition within the glomerular mesangium in the absence of autoimmune nephritis. Serum transfer into B cell-deficient Vangl1+/− mice results in mesangial IgG deposition indicating that Ig deposits occur in a kidney-intrinsic fashion in the absence of Vangl1. These results suggest that Vangl1 acts in the kidney to prevent Ig deposits and its deficiency may trigger nephritis in individuals with SLE.

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have been successfully used for the treatment of hematological malignancies including acute and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia. However, results of CAR T cell projects in solid tumors have been less impressive to date, partly because of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). It is widely known that high adenosine production is an important factor causing tumor-induced immunosuppression in TME, and adenosine mediates the suppression of anti-tumor T cell responses via binding and signaling through adenosine 2a receptor (A2aR). Previous studies have shown that adenosine generated by cancer cells significantly inhibits T cell anti-tumor activity through binding and then activating adenosine 2A receptors (A2aRs) of T cells. Based on the previous work, in our study, we evaluated whether A2aR disruption by shRNA could enhance the anti-tumor function of anti-mesothelin (MSLN) CAR T cells both in vitro and in vivo. For this goal above, we used MSLN-positive human ovarian serous carcinoma cells (SKOV3) and human colon cancer cells (HCT116) as target cancer cells while MSLN-negative human ovarian cancer cells (ES2) as non-target cancer cells. We observed that targeting cell-intrinsic A2aR through shRNA overexpression caused significant A2aR disruption in CAR T cells and profoundly increased CAR T cell efficacy in both CAR T cell cytokine production and cytotoxicity towards MSLN-positive cancer cells in vitro. More importantly, in SKOV3 xenograft mouse models, anti-MSLN CAR-T cells significantly reduced the tumor burden compared with non-transduced T cells, and the anti-tumor activity of A2aR-disrupted anti-MSLN CAR-T cells was stronger than that of wild-type anti-MSLN CAR-T cells. Altogether, our study showed enhanced anti-tumor efficacy caused by shRNA-mediated A2aR disruption in anti-MSLN CAR T cells both in vitro and in vivo, which proved that shRNA-mediated modification of gene expression might be an excellent strategy for improving CAR T cell function in immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and could potentially improve the outcome of treatment in clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cells (DCs) excel at cross-presenting antigens, but their effectiveness as cancer vaccine is limited. Here, we describe a vaccination approach using mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) engineered to express the immunoproteasome complex (MSC-IPr). Such modification instills efficient antigen cross-presentation abilities associated with enhanced major histocompatibility complex class I and CD80 expression, de novo production of interleukin-12, and higher chemokine secretion. This cross-presentation capacity of MSC-IPr is highly dependent on their metabolic activity. Compared with DCs, MSC-IPr hold the ability to cross-present a vastly different epitope repertoire, which translates into potent re-activation of T cell immunity against EL4 and A20 lymphomas and B16 melanoma tumors. Moreover, therapeutic vaccination of mice with pre-established tumors efficiently controls cancer growth, an effect further enhanced when combined with antibodies targeting PD-1, CTLA4, LAG3, or 4-1BB under both autologous and allogeneic settings. Therefore, MSC-IPr constitute a promising subset of non-hematopoietic antigen-presenting cells suitable for designing universal cell-based cancer vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Cell communication underlies emergent functions in diverse cell types and tissues. Recent evidence suggests that macrophages are organized in communicating networks, but new tools are needed to quantitatively characterize the resulting cellular conversations. Here, we infer cell communication from spatiotemporal correlations of intracellular calcium dynamics that are non-destructively imaged across cell populations expressing genetically encoded calcium indicators. We describe a hematopoietic calcium reporter mouse (Csf1rCreGCaMP5fl) and a computational analysis pipeline for inferring communication between reporter cells based on “excess synchrony.” We observed signals suggestive of cell communication in macrophages treated with immune-stimulatory DNA in vitro and tumor-associated immune cells imaged in a dorsal window chamber model in vivo. Together, the methods described here expand the toolkit for discovery of cell communication events in macrophages and other immune cells.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleic acid purification is a critical aspect of biomedical research and a multibillion-dollar industry. Here we establish sequence-selective RNA capture, release, and isolation using conformationally responsive DNA nanoswitches. We validate purification of specific RNAs ranging in size from 22 to 401 nt with up to 75% recovery and 99.98% purity in a benchtop process with minimal expense and equipment. Our method compared favorably with bead-based extraction of an endogenous microRNA from cellular total RNA, and can be programmed for multiplexed purification of multiple individual RNA targets from one sample. Coupling our approach with downstream LC/MS, we analyzed RNA modifications in 5.8S ribosomal RNA, and found 2′-O-methylguanosine, 2′-O-methyluridine, and pseudouridine in a ratio of ∼1:7:22. The simplicity, low cost, and low sample requirements of our method make it suitable for easy adoption, and the versatility of the approach provides opportunities to expand the strategy to other biomolecules.

Abstract: Neural stem/precursor cells (NPC) exhibit powerful immune-modulatory properties. Attenuation of neuroinflammation by intra-cerebroventricular transplantation of NPC, protects from immune-mediated demyelination and axonal injury. The immune modulatory properties of NPC are mediated by a non-species-specific, multiple bystander effect, mediated by both direct cell-cell contact, and by soluble factor(s). CD200 is a cell-surface molecule, with important roles in regulating diverse immune responses, and shown also to limit neuroinflammatory processes. We hypothesized that CD200 may play a role in mediating immune-modulatory effects of NPC. We used wild type and CD200-deficient NPC to examine the role of CD200 in mediating two vital aspects of NPC -immune modulatory properties: (1) Attenuation of autoimmune neuroinflammation; and (2) Suppression of immune rejection response towards transplanted allogeneic NPC from the host CNS. We found that CD200 is dispensable for attenuating acute experimental autoimmune neuroinflammation, but is required for protecting transplanted allogeneic NPC from immune rejection by the host tissue. CD200 deficient NPC showed similar growth, differentiation and survival properties as wild type NPC. CD200-deficient NPC attenuated efficiently T cell activation and proliferation, but exhibited reduced ability to inhibit macrophages. We conclude that CD200 plays a partial role in mediating the immune-modulatory properties of NPC. The differential effect on T cells versus macrophages may underlie the observed discrepancy in their function in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Trajectory inference (TI) methods infer cell developmental trajectory from single-cell RNA sequencing data. Current TI methods can be categorized into those using RNA velocity information and those using only single-cell gene expression data. The latter type of methods are restricted to certain trajectory structures, and cannot determine cell developmental direction. Recently proposed TI methods using RNA velocity information have limited accuracy. We present CellPath, a method that infers cell trajectories by integrating single-cell gene expression and RNA velocity information. CellPath overcomes the restrictions of TI methods that do not use RNA velocity information: it can find multiple high-resolution trajectories without constraints on the trajectory structure, and can automatically detect the direction of each trajectory path. We evaluate CellPath on both real and simulated datasets and show that CellPath finds more accurate and detailed trajectories than the state-of-the-art TI methods using or not using RNA velocity information.

Abstract: Summary
Deciphering the spatial composition of cells in tissues is essential for detailed understanding of biological processes in health and disease. Recent technological advances enabled the assessment of the enormous complexity of tissue-derived parameters by highly multiplexed tissue imaging (HMTI), but elaborate machinery and data analyses are required. This severely limits broad applicability of HMTI. Here we demonstrate for the first time the application of ChipCytometry technology, which has unique features for widespread use, on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, the most commonly used storage technique of clinically relevant patient specimens worldwide. The excellent staining quality permits workflows for automated quantification of signal intensities, which we further optimized to compensate signal spillover from neighboring cells. In combination with the high number of validated markers, the reported platform can be used from unbiased analyses of tissue composition to detection of phenotypically complex rare cells, and can be easily implemented in both routine research and clinical pathology.

Abstract: Summary
There is an urgent need for new drug regimens to rapidly cure tuberculosis. Here, we report the development of drug response assayer (DRonA) and “MLSynergy,” algorithms to perform rapid drug response assays and predict response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to drug combinations. Using a transcriptome signature for cell viability, DRonA detects Mtb killing by diverse mechanisms in broth culture, macrophage infection, and patient sputum, providing an efficient and more sensitive alternative to time- and resource-intensive bacteriologic assays. Further, MLSynergy builds on DRonA to predict synergistic and antagonistic multidrug combinations using transcriptomes of Mtb treated with single drugs. Together, DRonA and MLSynergy represent a generalizable framework for rapid monitoring of drug effects in host-relevant contexts and accelerate the discovery of efficacious high-order drug combinations.

Abstract: Summary
Quantitative analysis of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from healthy donors is a powerful tool for uncovering the relationship between genetic variants and cellular behavior. We previously identified rare, deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) in cell adhesion genes that are associated with outlier iPSC phenotypes in the pluripotent state. Here, we generated micropatterned colonies of iPSCs to test whether nsSNVs influence patterning of radially ordered germ layers. Using a custom-built image analysis pipeline, we quantified the differentiation phenotypes of 13 iPSC lines that harbor nsSNVs in genes related to cell adhesion or germ layer development. All iPSC lines differentiated into the three germ layers; however, there was donor-specific variation in germ layer patterning. We identified one line that presented an outlier phenotype of expanded endodermal differentiation, which was associated with a nsSNV in ITGB1. Our study establishes a platform for investigating the impact of nsSNVs on differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Trauma is a leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide. Here, we present the analysis of a longitudinal multi-omic dataset comprising clinical, cytokine, endotheliopathy biomarker, lipidome, metabolome, and proteome data from severely injured humans. A “systemic storm” pattern with release of 1,061 markers, together with a pattern suggestive of the “massive consumption” of 892 constitutive circulating markers, is identified in the acute phase post-trauma. Data integration reveals two human injury response endotypes, which align with clinical trajectory. Prehospital thawed plasma rescues only endotype 2 patients with traumatic brain injury (30-day mortality: 30.3 versus 75.0%; p = 0.0015). Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) was identified as the most predictive circulating biomarker to identify endotype 2-traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. These response patterns refine the paradigm for human injury, while the datasets provide a resource for the study of critical illness, trauma, and human stress responses.

Abstract: Summary
Cases of Leber congenital amaurosis caused by mutations in CRX (LCA7) exhibit an early form of the disease and show signs of significant photoreceptor dysfunction and eventual loss. To establish a translational in vitro model system to study gene-editing-based therapies, we generated LCA7 retinal organoids harboring a dominant disease-causing mutation in CRX. Our LCA7 retinal organoids develop signs of immature and dysfunctional photoreceptor cells, providing us with a reliable in vitro model to recapitulate LCA7. Furthermore, we performed a proof-of-concept study in which we utilize allele-specific CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing to knock out mutant CRX and saw moderate rescue of photoreceptor phenotypes in our organoids. This work provides early evidence for an effective approach to treat LCA7, which can be applied more broadly to other dominant genetic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Lactate metabolism has been shown to have increasingly important implications in cellular functions as well as in the development and pathophysiology of disease. The various roles as a signaling molecule and metabolite have led to interest in establishing a new method to detect lactate changes in live cells. Here we report our development of a genetically encoded metabolic indicator specifically for probing lactate (GEM-IL) based on superfolder fluorescent proteins and mutagenesis. With improvements in its design, specificity, and sensitivity, GEM-IL allows new applications compared with the previous lactate indicators, Laconic and Green Lindoblum. We demonstrate the functionality of GEM-IL to detect differences in lactate changes in human oncogenic neural progenitor cells and mouse primary ventricular myocytes. The development and application of GEM-IL show promise for enhancing our understanding of lactate dynamics and roles.

Abstract: Summary
A library of well-characterized human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines from clinically healthy human subjects could serve as a useful resource of normal controls for in vitro human development, disease modeling, genotype-phenotype association studies, and drug response evaluation. We report generation and extensive characterization of a gender-balanced, racially/ethnically diverse library of hiPSC lines from 40 clinically healthy human individuals who range in age from 22 to 61 years. The hiPSCs match the karyotype and short tandem repeat identities of their parental fibroblasts, and have a transcription profile characteristic of pluripotent stem cells. We provide whole-genome sequencing data for one hiPSC clone from each individual, genomic ancestry determination, and analysis of mendelian disease genes and risks. We document similar transcriptomic profiles, single-cell RNA-sequencing-derived cell clusters, and physiology of cardiomyocytes differentiated from multiple independent hiPSC lines. This extensive characterization makes this hiPSC library a valuable resource for many studies on human biology.

LncRNA HOTTIP from synovial fibroblast-derived exosomes: A novel molecular target for rheumatoid arthritis through the miR-1908–5p/STAT3 axis,

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammation mediated by autoimmune responses. HOTTIP, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), participates in cell proliferation and invasion. However, the correlation between HOTTIP and RA remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify how HOTTIP works in RA and to investigate its role in the development of RA. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle progression. Binding between HOTTIP, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and miR-1908–5p was demonstrated by dual-luciferase assays. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) was used to measure the expression of T cell differentiation-related proteins. We found that HOTTIP was upregulated in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). HOTTIP directly bound to miR-1908–5p and negatively modulated miR-1908–5p expression while positively regulating STAT3. The effects of HOTTIP overexpression on regulating the balance of the Th17/Treg cell ratio were partly reversed by miR-1908–5p overexpression. In addition, in vivo experiments demonstrated that overexpression of HOTTIP aggravated inflammation in RA mice, which was demonstrated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and the increased expression levels of CD4+ interleukin (IL)-17+, forkhead Box P3 (FOXP3) and retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma-t (RORγt). In summary, our study suggests that HOTTIP plays a damaging role in RA by promoting inflammation, which may be related to the regulation of miR-1908–5p expression and the STAT3 signaling pathway. These results suggest that the regulation of HOTTIP may be a promising therapeutic strategy for RA.

Abstract: NODAL signaling plays an essential role in vertebrate embryonic patterning and heart development. Accumulating evidences suggest that genetic mutations in TGF-β/NODAL signaling pathway can cause congenital heart disease in humans. To investigate the implication of NODAL signaling in isolated cardiovascular malformation, we have screened 300 non-syndromic CHD cases and 200 controls for NODAL and ACVR1B by Sanger sequencing and identified two rare missense (c.152C > T; p.P51L and c.981 T > A; p.D327E) variants in NODAL and a novel missense variant c.1035G > A; p.M345I in ACVR1B. All these variants are absent in 200 controls. Three-dimensional protein-modelling demonstrates that both p.P51L and p.D327E variations of NODAL and p.M345I mutation of ACVR1B, affect the tertiary structure of respective proteins. Variants of NODAL (p.P51L and p.D327E) and ACVR1B (p.M345I), significantly reduce the transactivation of AR3-Luc, (CAGA)12-Luc and (SBE)4-Luc promoters. Moreover, qRT-PCR results have also deciphered a reduction in the expression of cardiac-enriched transcription factors namely Gata4, Nkx2-5, and Tbx5 in both the mutants of NODAL. Decreased expression of, Gata4, Nkx2-5, Tbx5, and lefty is observed in p.M345I mutant of ACVR1B as well. Additionally, reduced phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 in response to these variants, suggests impaired NODAL signaling and possibly responsible for defective cell fate decision and differentiation of cardiomyocytes leading to CHD phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
AMPK is an energy sensor modulating metabolism, inflammation, and a target for metabolic disorders. Metabolic dysfunction results in lower AMPK activity. PXL770 is a direct AMPK activator, inhibiting de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and producing efficacy in preclinical models. We aimed to assess pharmacokinetics, safety, and pharmacodynamics of PXL770 in humans with metabolic syndrome-associated fatty liver disease. In a randomized, double-blind four-week trial, 12 overweight/obese patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance received PXL770 500 mg QD; 4 subjects received matching placebo. Endpoints included pharmacokinetics, hepatic fractional DNL, oral glucose tolerance testing, additional pharmacodynamic parameters, and safety. PK parameters show adequate plasma exposure in NAFLD patients for daily oral dosing. PXL770 decreases DNL—both peak and AUC are reduced versus baseline—and improves glycemic parameters and indices of insulin sensitivity versus baseline. Assessment of specific lipids reveals decrease in diacyglycerols/triacylglycerols. Safety/tolerability are similar to placebo. These results unveil initial human translation of AMPK activation and support this therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) show cell-to-cell heterogeneity. A small number of two-cell-like cells (2CLCs) marked by endogenous retrovirus activation emerge spontaneously. The 2CLCs are unstable and they are prone to transiting back to the pluripotent state without extrinsic stimulus. To understand how this bidirectional transition takes place, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on isolated 2CLCs that underwent 2C-like state exit and re-entry, and revealed a step-by-step transitional process between 2C-like and pluripotent states. Mechanistically, we found that cell cycle played an important role in mediating these transitions by regulating assembly of the nucleolus and peri-nucleolar heterochromatin to influence 2C gene Dux expression. Collectively, our findings provide a roadmap of the 2C-like state entry and exit in ESCs and also a causal role of the cell cycle in promoting these transitions.

Abstract: Summary
Despite its role in cancer surveillance, adoptive immunotherapy using γδ T cells has achieved limited efficacy. To enhance trafficking to bone marrow, circulating Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are expanded in serum-free medium containing TGF-β1 and IL-2 (γδ[T2] cells) or medium containing IL-2 alone (γδ[2] cells, as the control). Unexpectedly, the yield and viability of γδ[T2] cells are also increased by TGF-β1, when compared to γδ[2] controls. γδ[T2] cells are less differentiated and yet display increased cytolytic activity, cytokine release, and antitumor activity in several leukemic and solid tumor models. Efficacy is further enhanced by cancer cell sensitization using aminobisphosphonates or Ara-C. A number of contributory effects of TGF-β are described, including prostaglandin E2 receptor downmodulation, TGF-β insensitivity, and upregulated integrin activity. Biological relevance is supported by the identification of a favorable γδ[T2] signature in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Given their enhanced therapeutic activity and compatibility with allogeneic use, γδ[T2] cells warrant evaluation in cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease significantly decreasing the quality of life. Platelets play an important and active role in the development of AS. Accumulating evidence demonstrated platelets contain diverse RNA repository inherited from megakaryocytes or microvesicles. Platelet RNAs are dynamically affected by pathological conditions and could be used as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. However, the role of the platelet RNAs in AS is elusive. In this study, we compared mRNA and circRNA profiles in platelets between AS patients and healthy controls using RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, and found 4996 mRNAs and 2942 circRNAs were differently expressed. The significantly over-expressed mRNAs in AS patients are involved in platelet activity, gap junction, focal adhesion, rap1 and toll and Imd signaling pathway. The previous identified platelet-derived immune mediators such as P2Y1, P2Y12, PF4, GPIbα, CD40L, ICAM2, CCL5 (RANTES), TGF-β (TGF-β1 and TGF-β2) and PDGF (PDGFB and PDGFA) are also included in these over expressed mRNAs, implying these factors may trigger inflammatory cascades and promote the development of AS. Additionally, we found two down-regulated circRNA (circPTPN22 and circFCHSD2) from the intersection analyses of platelets and spinal ligament tissues of AS patients. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of these two circRNAs was constructed, and the target mRNAs were enriched in Th17 cell differentiation, inflammatory bowel disease, cell adhesion molecules, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Jak-STAT and Wnt signaling pathway, all these pathways participate in the bone remodeling and pro/anti-inflammatory immune regulation in AS. Then, qRT-PCR was performed to validate the expression of selected key mRNAs and circRNAs and the results demonstrated that the expression levels of P2Y12, GPIbα, circPTPN22 and circFCHSD2 were consistent with the sequencing analysis. In addition, the high expression of five predicted miRNAs interacting with circPTPN22 and circFCHSD2 were also detected in AS by qRT-PCR. Taken together, our study presents a comprehensive overview of mRNAs and circRNAs in platelets in AS patients and offers new insight into the mechanisms of platelet involving in the pathogenesis of AS. The mRNAs and circRNAs identified in this study may serve as candidates for diagnosis and targeted treatment of AS.

Isoform-specific functions of synaptopodin-2 variants in cytoskeleton stabilization and autophagy regulation in muscle under mechanical stress,

Abstract: Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in multicellular organisms depends on the maintenance of force-bearing and force-generating cellular structures. Within myofibrillar Z-discs of striated muscle, isoforms of synaptopodin-2 (SYNPO2/myopodin) act as adapter proteins that are engaged in proteostasis of the actin-crosslinking protein filamin C (FLNc) under mechanical stress. SYNPO2 directly binds F-actin, FLNc and α-actinin and thus contributes to the architectural features of the actin cytoskeleton. By its association with autophagy mediating proteins, i.e. BAG3 and VPS18, SYNPO2 is also engaged in protein quality control and helps to target mechanical unfolded and damaged FLNc for degradation. Here we show that deficiency of all SYNPO2-isoforms in myotubes leads to decreased myofibrillar stability and deregulated autophagy under mechanical stress. In addition, isoform-specific proteostasis functions were revealed. The PDZ-domain containing variant SYNPO2b and the shorter, PDZ-less isoform SYNPO2e both localize to Z-discs. Yet, SYNPO2e is less stably associated with the Z-disc than SYNPO2b, and is dynamically transferred into FLNc-containing myofibrillar lesions under mechanical stress. SYNPO2e also recruits BAG3 into these lesions via interaction with the WW domain of BAG3. Our data provide evidence for a role of myofibrillar lesions as a transient quality control compartment essential to prevent and repair contraction-induced myofibril damage in muscle and indicate an important coordinating activity for SYNPO2 therein.

Abstract: Summary
Persistence of HIV-1 latent reservoir cells during antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a major obstacle for curing HIV-1. Even though latency-reversing agents (LRAs) are under development to reactivate and eradicate latently infected cells, there are few useful models for evaluating LRA activity in vitro. Here, we establish a long-term cell culture system called the “widely distributed intact provirus elimination” (WIPE) assay. It harbors thousands of different HIV-1-infected cell clones with a wide distribution of HIV-1 provirus similar to that observed in vivo. Mathematical modeling and experimental results from this in vitro infection model demonstrates that the addition of an LRA to ART shows a latency-reversing effect and contributes to the eradication of replication-competent HIV-1. The WIPE assay can be used to optimize therapeutics against HIV-1 latency and investigate mechanistic insights into the clonal selection of heterogeneous HIV-1-infected cells.

Abstract: Summary
Although divergent dengue viruses (DENVs) have been isolated in insects, nonhuman primates, and humans, their relationships to the four canonical serotypes (DENV 1–4) are poorly understood. One virus isolated from a dengue patient, DKE-121, falls between genotype and serotype levels of sequence divergence to DENV-4. To examine its antigenic relationship to DENV-4, we assessed serum neutralizing and protective activity. Whereas DENV-4-immune mouse sera neutralize DKE-121 infection, DKE-121-immune sera inhibit DENV-4 less efficiently. Passive transfer of DENV-4 or DKE-121-immune sera protects mice against homologous, but not heterologous, DENV-4 or DKE-121 challenge. Antigenic cartography suggests that DENV-4 and DKE-121 are related but antigenically distinct. However, DENV-4 vaccination confers protection against DKE-121 in nonhuman primates, and serum from humans immunized with a tetravalent vaccine neutralize DENV-4 and DKE-121 infection equivalently. As divergent DENV strains, such as DKE-121, may meet criteria for serotype distinction, monitoring their capacity to impact dengue disease and vaccine efficacy appears warranted.

Abstract: Summary
We developed a metatranscriptomics method that can simultaneously capture the respiratory virome, microbiome, and host response directly from low biomass samples. Using nasal swab samples, we capture RNA virome with sufficient sequencing depth required to assemble complete genomes. We find a surprisingly high frequency of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and coronavirus (CoV) in healthy children, and a high frequency of RSV-A and RSV-B co-detections in children with symptomatic RSV. In addition, we have identified commensal and pathogenic bacteria and fungi at the species level. Functional analysis revealed that H. influenzae was highly active in symptomatic RSV subjects. The host nasal transcriptome reveled upregulation of the innate immune system, anti-viral response and inflammasome pathway, and downregulation of fatty acid pathways in children with symptomatic RSV. Overall, we demonstrate that our method is broadly applicable to infer the transcriptome landscape of an infected system, surveil respiratory infections, and to sequence RNA viruses directly from clinical samples.

Abstract: Summary
While pregnancy increases the risk for severe COVID-19, the clinical and immunological implications of COVID-19 on maternal-fetal health remain unknown. Here, we present the clinical and immunological landscapes of 93 COVID-19 mothers and 45 of their SARS-CoV-2-exposed infants through comprehensive serum proteomics profiling for >1,400 cytokines of their peripheral and cord blood specimens. Prenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory immune activation. Pregnant women with severe COVID-19 show increased inflammation and unique IFN-λ antiviral signaling, with elevated levels of IFNL1 and IFNLR1. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection re-shapes maternal immunity at delivery, altering the expression of pregnancy complication-associated cytokines, inducing MMP7, MDK, and ESM1 and reducing BGN and CD209. Finally, COVID-19-exposed infants exhibit induction of T cell-associated cytokines (IL33, NFATC3, and CCL21), while some undergo IL-1β/IL-18/CASP1 axis-driven neonatal respiratory distress despite birth at term. Our findings demonstrate COVID-19-induced immune rewiring in both mothers and neonates, warranting long-term clinical follow-up to mitigate potential health risks.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) damage, and its injury is the primary cause of bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic failure and even death after exposure to a certain dose of IR. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we show that mitochondrial oxidative damage, which is characterized by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species overproduction, mitochondrial membrane potential reduction and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, is rapidly induced in both human and mouse HSCs and directly accelerates HSC apoptosis after IR exposure. Mechanistically, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) is induced by IR exposure and contributes to IR-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage through inducing lipid peroxidation. Intriguingly, a natural antioxidant, caffeic acid (CA), can attenuate IR-induced HSC apoptosis through suppressing 5-LOX-mediated mitochondrial oxidative damage, thus protecting against BM hematopoietic failure after IR exposure. These findings uncover a critical role for mitochondria in IR-induced HSC injury and highlight the therapeutic potential of CA in BM hematopoietic failure induced by IR.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the molecular determinants that underpin the clinical heterogeneity of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is essential for prognostication and therapy development. Stage T1 disease in particular presents a high risk of progression and requires improved understanding. We present a detailed multi-omics study containing gene expression, copy number, and mutational profiles that show relationships to immune infiltration, disease recurrence, and progression to muscle invasion. We compare expression and genomic subtypes derived from all NMIBCs with those derived from the individual disease stages Ta and T1. We show that sufficient molecular heterogeneity exists within the separate stages to allow subclassification and that this is more clinically meaningful for stage T1 disease than that derived from all NMIBCs. This provides improved biological understanding and identifies subtypes of T1 tumors that may benefit from chemo- or immunotherapy.

Abstract: Colon cancer is one of the most common cancers, currently treated with traditional chemotherapies or alternative therapies. However, these treatments are still not enough effective and induce several side effects, so that the search of new therapeutic strategies is needed. The use of Poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, although originally approved against BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 mutated cancers, has been extended, particularly in combination with other treatments, to cure cancers that do not display defects in DNA repair signaling pathways. The role of p53 oncosuppressor in the regulating the outcome of PARP inhibitor treatment remains an open issue. In this study, we addressed this topic by using a well-tolerated PARP 1/2/3 inhibitor, namely AZD2461, against colon cancer cell lines with different p53 status. We found that AZD2461 reduced cell proliferation in wtp53 and p53−/− cancer cells by increasing ROS and DNA damage, while R273H mutant (mut) p53 counteracted these effects. Moreover, AZD2461 improved the reduction of cell proliferation by low dose radiation (IR) in wtp53 cancer cells, in which a down-regulation of BRCA-1 occurred. AZD2461 did not affect cell proliferation of mutp53 colon cancer cells also in combination with low dose radiation, suggesting that only wt p53 or p53 null colon cancer cells could benefit AZD2461 treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Q fever is caused by the intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii, for which there is no approved vaccine in the United States. A formalin-inactivated whole-cell vaccine (WCV) from virulent C. burnetii NMI provides single-dose long-lived protection, but concerns remain over vaccine reactogenicity. We therefore sought an alternate approach by purifying native C. burnetii antigens from the clonally derived avirulent NMII strain. A soluble bacterial extract, termed Sol II, elicits high-titer, high-avidity antibodies and induces a CD4 T cell response that confers protection in naive mice. In addition, Sol II protects against pulmonary C. burnetii challenge in three animal models without inducing hypersensitivity. An NMI-derived extract, Sol I, enhances protection further and outperforms the WCV gold standard. Collectively, these data represent a promising approach to design highly effective, non-reactogenic Q fever vaccines.

Abstract: Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) has been demonstrated to act as a tumor promotor or suppressor in different types of cancers. However, little is known about the effect of CPT2 on colorectal cancer (CRC). In the present study, we analyzed CPT2 expression in CRC tissues and cells. CPT2 was overexpressed in CRC cell lines (SW480 and RKO), and its effects and molecular mechanism on the proliferation, glycolysis, stemness, and oxaliplatin sensitivity were investigated. The xenograft experiment was used to confirm the influence of CPT2 on CRC tumorigenesis in vivo. We found that CPT2 expression was significantly downregulated in CRC patients, and its lower expression was associated with the poor prognosis, large tumor size, advanced TNM stage, and poor histological grade differentiation of patients. Upregulation of CPT2 significantly inhibited the proliferation, glycolytic metabolism, cancer stem cell properties, and oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells. Also, the increase of CPT2 inhibited tumorigenesis, stemness and glycolysis, while enhanced oxaliplatin sensitivity in mouse models. Mechanistically, CPT2 functioned via suppressing the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway through repressing ROS production. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that CPT2 was decreased in CRC, and CPT2 downregulation could trigger stemness and oxaliplatin resistance in CRC via activating the ROS/Wnt/β-catenin-induced glycolytic metabolism. This study indicates that CPT2 is a potential therapeutic target for CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic cells differentiate through several progenitors in a hierarchical manner, and recent single-cell analyses have revealed substantial heterogeneity within each progenitor. Although common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) are defined as a multipotent cell population that can differentiate into granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs), and GMPs generate neutrophils and monocytes, these myeloid progenitors must contain some lineage-committed progenitors. Through gene expression analysis at single-cell levels, we identified CD62L as a marker to reveal the heterogeneity. We confirmed that CD62L-negative CMPs represent “bona fide” CMPs, whereas CD62L-high CMPs are mostly restricted to GMP potentials both in mice and humans. In addition, we identified CD62L-negative GMPs as the most immature subsets in GMPs and Ly6C+CD62L-intermediate and Ly6C+CD62L-high GMPs are skewed to neutrophil and monocyte differentiation in mice, respectively. Our findings contribute to more profound understanding about the mechanism of myeloid differentiation.

Abstract: Plekha7 (Pleckstrin homology [PH] domain containing, family A member 7) regulates the assembly of proteins of the cytoplasmic apical zonula adherens junction (AJ), thus ensuring cell-cell adhesion and tight-junction barrier integrity. Little is known of Plekha7 function in cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC) Plekha7 expression is elevated compared to adjacent normal tissue levels, increasing with clinical stage. Plekha7 was present at plasma membrane AJ with wild-type KRas (wt-KRas) but was dispersed in cells expressing mutant KRas (mut-KRas). Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) indicated a direct Plekha7 interaction with wt-KRas but scantily with mut-KRas. Inhibiting Plekha7 specifically decreased mut-KRas cell signaling, proliferation, attachment, migration, and retarded mut-KRAS CRC tumor growth. Binding of diC8-phosphoinositides (PI) to the PH domain of Plekha7 was relatively low affinity. This may be because a D175 amino acid residue plays a “sentry” role preventing PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 binding. Molecular or pharmacological inhibition of the Plekha7 PH domain prevented the growth of mut-KRas but not wt-KRas cells. Taken together the studies suggest that Plekha7, in addition to maintaining AJ structure plays a role in mut-KRas signaling and phenotype through interaction of its PH domain with membrane mut-KRas, but not wt-KRas, to increase the efficiency of mut-KRas downstream signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-based immunotherapy has become the new-generation cancer medicine, and “off-the-shelf” cell products that can be manufactured at large scale and distributed readily to treat patients are necessary. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are ideal cell carriers for developing allogeneic cell therapy because they are powerful immune cells targeting cancers without graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) risk. However, healthy donor blood contains extremely low numbers of endogenous iNKT cells. Here, by combining hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene engineering and in vitro differentiation, we generate human allogeneic HSC-engineered iNKT (AlloHSC-iNKT) cells at high yield and purity; these cells closely resemble endogenous iNKT cells, effectively target tumor cells using multiple mechanisms, and exhibit high safety and low immunogenicity. These cells can be further engineered with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to enhance tumor targeting or/and gene edited to ablate surface human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules and further reduce immunogenicity. Collectively, these preclinical studies demonstrate the feasibility and cancer therapy potential of AlloHSC-iNKT cell products and lay a foundation for their translational and clinical development.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of nucleic acid sensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in B cells is involved in antiviral responses by promoting B cell activation and germinal center responses. In order to take advantage of this natural pathway for vaccine development, synthetic pathogen-like antigens (PLAs) constructed of multivalent antigens with encapsulated TLR ligands can be used to activate B cell antigen receptors and TLRs in a synergistic manner. Here we report a PLA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine candidate designed by combining a phage-derived virus-like particle carrying bacterial RNA as TLR ligands with the receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) S protein as the target antigen. This PLA-based vaccine candidate induces robust neutralizing antibodies in both mice and non-human primates (NHPs). Using a NHP infection model, we demonstrate that the viral clearance is accelerated in vaccinated animals. In addition, the PLA-based vaccine induces a T helper 1 (Th1)-oriented response and a durable memory, supporting its potential for further clinical development.

Abstract: Human periodontal ligament fibroblast (HPDLF) is a major component of the resident cells in the periodontal microenvironment, and plays important roles in periodontitis through multiple mechanisms. Although lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) in HPDLF, the mechanisms governing HPDLF function in periodontitis are unclear. In this study, we tested the ability of unfolded protein response (UPR) to regulate HPDLF in vitro and examined the underlying mechanisms. We found LPS-pretreated HPDLF induced macrophage polarization toward M1 phenotype. UPR activation reduced the inflammatory cytokine production and downregulated the expression of TLR4 in HPDLF. The phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and I-κB was also inhibited by UPR activation. Our findings demonstrate that the connection of LPS, UPR, and HPDLF may represent a new concrete theory of innate immunity regulation in periodontal diseases, and suggest that targeting of UPR in HPDLF may be developed as a potent therapy for periodontitis.

Abstract: Substituting green hydrogen for conventional fuels will serve to decarbonise the energy system and reduce its water consumption. Benefits will also accrue for the water sector, including improving the efficiency of wastewater treatment, oxygenating hypoxic water bodies, improving the provision of drinking water supplies in arid regions, and making better use of the seawater resource. Accordingly it is recommended that national ‘net zero’ strategies address renewable electricity, green hydrogen and water use in a more integrated manner.

Abstract: Summary
The ratio of oxidized to reduced NAD (NAD+/NADH) sets intracellular redox balance and antioxidant capacity. Intracellular NAD is compartmentalized and the mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio is intricately linked to cellular function. Here, we report the monitoring of the NAD+/NADH ratio in mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments in live cells by using a modified genetic biosensor (SoNar). The fluorescence signal of SoNar targeted to mitochondria (mt-SoNar) or cytosol (ct-SoNar) responded linearly to physiological NAD+/NADH ratios in situ. NAD+/NADH ratios in cytosol versus mitochondria responded rapidly, but differently, to acute metabolic perturbations, indicating distinct NAD pools. Subcellular NAD redox balance regained homeostasis via communications through malate-aspartate shuttle. Mitochondrial and cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratios are influenced by NAD+ precursor levels and are distinctly regulated under pathophysiological conditions. Compartment-targeted biosensors and real-time imaging allow assessment of subcellular NAD+/NADH redox signaling in live cells, enabling future mechanistic research of NAD redox in cell biology and disease development.

Abstract: Summary
Although alveolar epithelial cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, few practical in vitro models exist to study them. Here, we established a novel in vitro pulmonary fibrosis model using alveolar organoids consisting of human pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar epithelial cells and primary human lung fibroblasts. In this human model, bleomycin treatment induced phenotypes such as epithelial cell-mediated fibroblast activation, cellular senescence, and presence of alveolar epithelial cells in abnormal differentiation states. Chemical screening performed to target these abnormalities showed that inhibition of ALK5 or blocking of integrin αVβ6 ameliorated the fibrogenic changes in the alveolar organoids. Furthermore, organoid contraction and extracellular matrix accumulation in the model recapitulated the pathological changes observed in pulmonary fibrosis. This human model may therefore accelerate the development of highly effective therapeutic agents for otherwise incurable pulmonary fibrosis by targeting alveolar epithelial cells and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex disease linked to several chronic diseases. We aimed at identifying genetic variants associated with NAFLD and evaluating their functional consequences. We performed a genome-wide meta-analysis of 4 cohorts of electronic health record-documented NAFLD in participants of European ancestry (8,434 cases and 770,180 controls). We identify 5 potential susceptibility loci for NAFLD (located at or near GCKR, TR1B1, MAU2/TM6SF2, APOE, and PNPLA3). We also report a potentially causal effect of lower LPL expression in adipose tissue on NAFLD susceptibility and an effect of the FTO genotype on NAFLD. Positive genetic correlations between NAFLD and cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors such as body fat accumulation/distribution, lipoprotein-lipid levels, insulin resistance, and coronary artery disease and negative genetic correlations with parental lifespan, socio-economic status, and acetoacetate levels are observed. This large GWAS meta-analysis reveals insights into the genetic architecture of NAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
Intraerythrocytic malaria parasites proliferate bounded by a parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM). The PVM contains nutrient permeable channels (NPCs) conductive to small molecules, but their relevance for parasite growth for individual metabolites is largely untested. Here we show that growth-relevant levels of major carbon and energy sources pass through the NPCs. Moreover, we find that NPCs are a gate for several antimalarial drugs, highlighting their permeability properties as a critical factor for drug design. Looking into NPC-dependent amino acid transport, we find that amino acid shortage is a reason for the fitness cost in artemisinin-resistant (ARTR) parasites and provide evidence that NPC upregulation to increase amino acids acquisition is a mechanism of ARTR parasites in vitro and in human infections to compensate this fitness cost. Hence, the NPCs are important for nutrient and drug access and reveal amino acid deprivation as a critical constraint in ARTR parasites.

Abstract: Summary
Pig cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) frequently undergoes incomplete epigenetic remodeling during the maternal-to-zygotic transition, which leads to a significant embryonic loss before implantation. Here, we generated the first genome-wide landscapes of histone methylation in pig SCNT embryos. Excessive H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, but not H3K4me3, were observed in the genomic regions with unfaithful embryonic genome activation and donor-cell-specific gene silencing. A combination of H3K9 demethylase KDM4A and GSK126, an inhibitor of H3K27me3 writer, were able to remove these epigenetic barriers and restore the global transcriptome in SCNT embryos. More importantly, thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) was defined as a pig-specific epigenetic regulator for nuclear reprogramming, which was not reactivated by H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 removal. Both combined treatment and transient TDG overexpression promoted DNA demethylation and enhanced the blastocyst-forming rates of SCNT embryos, thus offering valuable methods to increase the cloning efficiency of genome-edited pigs for agricultural and biomedical purposes.

Abstract: Summary
Severe infection can dramatically alter blood production, but the mechanisms driving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSC/HSPC) loss have not been clearly defined. Using Ixodes ovatus Ehrlichia (IOE), a tick-borne pathogen that causes severe shock-like illness and bone marrow (BM) aplasia, type I and II interferons (IFNs) promoted loss of HSPCs via increased cell death and enforced quiescence. IFN-αβ were required for increased interleukin 18 (IL-18) expression during infection, correlating with ST-HSC loss. IL-18 deficiency prevented BM aplasia and increased HSC/HSPCs. IL-18R signaling was intrinsically required for ST-HSC quiescence, but not for HSPC cell death. To elucidate cell death mechanisms, MLKL- or gasdermin D-deficient mice were infected; whereas Mlkl−/− mice exhibited protected HSC/HSPCs, no such protection was observed in Gsdmd−/− mice during infection. MLKL deficiency intrinsically protected HSCs during infection and improved hematopoietic output upon recovery. These studies define MLKL and IL-18R signaling in HSC loss and suppressed hematopoietic function in shock-like infection.

Abstract: Summary
Trajectories of cognitive decline vary considerably among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To address this heterogeneity, subtyping approaches have been developed, with the objective of identifying more homogeneous subgroups. To date, subtyping of MCI has been based primarily on cognitive measures, often resulting in indistinct boundaries between subgroups and limited validity. Here, we introduce a subtyping method for MCI based solely upon brain atrophy. We train a deep learning model to differentiate between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitively normal (CN) subjects based on whole-brain MRI features. We then deploy the trained model to classify MCI subjects based on whole-brain gray matter resemblance to AD-like or CN-like patterns. We subsequently validate the subtyping approach using cognitive, clinical, fluid biomarker, and molecular imaging data. Overall, the results suggest that atrophy patterns in MCI are sufficiently heterogeneous and can thus be used to subtype individuals into biologically and clinically meaningful subgroups.

Abstract: Objective
The objective was to evaluate the expression levels of CD31+CD54+ and CD31+CD105+ endothelial microparticles (EMPs) before and after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment of Kawasaki disease (KD). To explore the role of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) in inhibiting endothelial inflammation in KD, the effects of hucMSCs on the expression of CD54 and CD105 in endothelial cells in KD were analyzed in vivo and in vitro.
Methods
The concentrations of IL-1β and VEGF in the peripheral blood of KD or healthy children were detected, and the distributions of CD31+CD54+ and CD31+CD105+ EMPs in platelet-poor plasma (PPP) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were first cocultured with the patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Next, HUVECs were cocultured with hucMSCs after stimulation with inactivated serum from patients. Cell proliferation and migration activities were assessed, and the expression of CD54, CD105 and IL-1β was analyzed. In an in vivo study, hucMSCs were transplanted into KD mice. The locations and expression levels of CD54, CD105 and IL-1β in the heart tissues of mice were analyzed.
Results
The levels of IL-1β and CD31+CD54+ EMPs were significantly higher before IVIG treatment and 2 weeks after treatment in KD patients (P < 0.01). However, the levels of VEGF and CD31+CD105+ EMPs increased significantly in KD only after IVIG treatment (P < 0.01). KD-inactivated serum stimulation combined with cocultivation of PBMCs can activate inflammation in HUVECs, leading to reduced cell proliferation and migration activities. Cocultivation also increased the expression of CD54 and decreased the expression of CD105 (P < 0.001). Cocultivation with hucMSCs can reverse these changes. Additionally, hucMSC transplantation downregulated the expression of IL-1β and CD54 and significantly upregulated the expression of CD105 in KD mice.
Conclusion
The expression levels of CD31+CD54+ and CD31+CD105+ EMPs showed inconsistent changes at different KD statuses, providing potential markers for clinical application. HucMSCs suppress inflammation and regulate the expression levels of CD54 and CD105 in vascular endothelial cells in KD, possibly providing a new basis for stem cell therapy for KD.

Abstract: One of the major impacts of climate change has been the marked rise in global temperature. Recently, we demonstrated that high temperatures (1-week exposure) disrupt prooxidant-antioxidant homeostasis and promote cellular apoptosis in the American oyster. In this study, we evaluated the effects of seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) on tissue morphology, extrapallial fluid (EPF) conditions, heat shock protein-70 (HSP70), dinitrophenyl protein (DNP, an indicator of reactive oxygen species, ROS), 3-nitrotyrosine protein (NTP, an indicator of RNS), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein expressions, and cellular apoptosis in gills and digestive glands of oysters collected on the southern Texas coast during the winter (15 °C), spring (24 °C), summer (30 °C), and fall (27 °C). Histological observations of both tissues showed a notable increase in mucus production and an enlargement of the digestive gland lumen with seasonal temperature rise, whereas biochemical analyses exhibited a significant decrease in EPF pH and protein concentration. Immunohistochemical analyses showed higher expression of HSP70 along with the expression of DNP and NTP in oyster tissues during summer. Intriguingly, CAT and SOD protein expressions exhibited significant upregulation with rising seasonal temperatures (15 to 27 °C), which decreased significantly in summer (30 °C), leaving oysters vulnerable to oxidative and nitrative damage. qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant increase in HSP70 mRNA levels in oyster tissues during the warmer seasons. In situ TUNNEL assay showed a significant increase in apoptotic cells in seasons with high temperature. These results suggest that elevated SST induces oxidative/nitrative stress through the overproduction of ROS/RNS and disrupts the antioxidant system which promotes cellular apoptosis in oysters.

Abstract: Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) has been reported to play a protective role against acute kidney injury by driving tubular regeneration. This study aims to probe the function of FOXM1 in diabetic nephropathy (DN) and the molecules involved. FOXM1 was poorly expressed in DN-diseased kidney tissues. A murine model of DN was established, and podocytes cells (MPC5) were treated with high-glucose (HG) for in vitro studies. FOXM1 overexpression improved kidney function and reduced pathological changes in mice, and it increased the expression of the podocyte marker Nephrin in kidney tissues. In vitro, FOXM1 increased viability and reduced pyroptosis of the HG-treated MPC5 cells, and it elevated the expression of the podocyte marker Nephrin whereas reduced the expression of pyroptosis-related NLRP3 inflammasome and cleaved caspase 1. FOXM1 bound to the promoter of sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) to induce transcriptional activation. Downregulation of SIRT4 blocked the protective roles of FOXM1 both in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in HG-treated cells was suppressed by FOXM1 but restored after SIRT4 inhibition. In conclusion, this study suggested that FOXM1 transcriptionally activates SIRT4 and inhibits NF-κB signaling and the NLRP3 inflammasome to alleviate kidney injury and podocyte pyroptosis in DN.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient delivery of specific cargos in vivo poses a major challenge to the secretory pathway, which shuttles products encoded by ∼30% of the genome. Newly synthesized protein and lipid cargos embark on the secretory pathway via COPII-coated vesicles, assembled by the GTPase SAR1 on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but how lipid-carrying lipoproteins are distinguished from the general protein cargos in the ER and selectively secreted has not been clear. Here, we show that this process is quantitatively governed by the GTPase SAR1B and SURF4, a high-efficiency cargo receptor. While both genes are implicated in lipid regulation in humans, hepatic inactivation of either mouse Sar1b or Surf4 selectively depletes plasma lipids to near-zero and protects the mice from atherosclerosis. These findings show that the pairing between SURF4 and SAR1B synergistically operates a specialized, dosage-sensitive transport program for circulating lipids, while further suggesting a potential translation to treat atherosclerosis and related cardio-metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The composition of intrinsic microbial communities determines if invading pathogens will find a suitable niche for colonization and cause infection or be eliminated. Here, we investigate how commensal E. coli mediate colonization resistance (CR) against Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Tm). Using synthetic bacterial communities, we show that the capacity of E. coli Mt1B1 to block S. Tm colonization depends on the microbial context. In an infection-permissive context, E. coli utilized a high diversity of carbon sources and was unable to block S. Tm invasion. In mice that were stably colonized by twelve phylogenetically diverse murine gut bacteria (OMM12), establishing a protective context, E. coli depleted galactitol, a substrate otherwise fueling S. Tm colonization. Here, Lachnospiraceae, capable of consuming C5 and C6 sugars, critically contributed to CR. We propose that E. coli provides CR by depleting a limited carbon source when in a microbial community adept at removing simple sugars from the intestine.

Abstract: Summary
Pathological examination is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, and breast tumor cells are often found in clusters. We report a case study on one triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient, analyzing tumor development, metastasis, and prognosis with simultaneous DNA and RNA sequencing of pathologist-defined cell clusters from multiregional frozen sections. The cell clusters are isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from primary tumor tissue, lymphatic vessels, and axillary lymph nodes. Data are reported for a total of 97 cell clusters. A combination of tumor cell-cluster clonality and phylogeny reveals 3 evolutionarily distinct pathways for this patient, each associated with a unique mRNA signature, and each correlated with disparate survival outcomes. Hub gene analysis indicates that extensive downregulation of ribosomal protein mRNA is a potential marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Resistance to platinum compounds is a major determinant of patient survival in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). To understand mechanisms of platinum resistance and identify potential therapeutic targets in resistant HGSOC, we generated a data resource composed of dynamic (±carboplatin) protein, post-translational modification, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles from intra-patient cell line pairs derived from 3 HGSOC patients before and after acquiring platinum resistance. These profiles reveal extensive responses to carboplatin that differ between sensitive and resistant cells. Higher fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathway expression is associated with platinum resistance, and both pharmacologic inhibition and CRISPR knockout of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), which represents a rate limiting step of FAO, sensitize HGSOC cells to platinum. The results are further validated in patient-derived xenograft models, indicating that CPT1A is a candidate therapeutic target to overcome platinum resistance. All multiomic data can be queried via an intuitive gene-query user interface (https://sites.google.com/view/ptrc-cell-line).

Abstract: Summary
Efficient translation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) requires scalable cell manufacturing strategies for optimal self-renewal and functional differentiation. Traditional manual cell culture is variable and labor intensive, posing challenges for high-throughput applications. Here, we established a robotic platform and automated all essential steps of hiPSC culture and differentiation under chemically defined conditions. This approach allowed rapid and standardized manufacturing of billions of hiPSCs that can be produced in parallel from up to 90 different patient- and disease-specific cell lines. Moreover, we established automated multi-lineage differentiation and generated functional neurons, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes. To validate our approach, we compared robotic and manual cell culture operations and performed comprehensive molecular and cellular characterizations (e.g., single-cell transcriptomics, mass cytometry, metabolism, electrophysiology) to benchmark industrial-scale cell culture operations toward building an integrated platform for efficient cell manufacturing for disease modeling, drug screening, and cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular morphology has the capacity to serve as a surrogate for cellular state and functionality. However, primary cardiomyocytes, the standard model in cardiovascular research, are highly heterogeneous cells and therefore impose methodological challenges to analysis. Hence, we aimed to devise a robust methodology to deconvolute cardiomyocyte morphology on a single-cell level: C-MORE (cellular morphology recognition) is a workflow from bench to data analysis tailored for heterogeneous primary cells using our R package cmoRe. We demonstrate its utility in proof-of-principle applications such as modulation of canonical hypertrophy pathways and linkage of genotype-phenotype in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). In our pilot study, exposure of cardiomyocytes to blood plasma prior to versus after aortic valve replacement allows identification of a disease fingerprint and reflects partial reversibility following therapeutic intervention. C-MORE is a valuable tool for cardiovascular research with possible fields of application in basic research and personalized medicine.

Abstract: Summary
We propose a new concept that human somatic cells can be converted to become male germline stem cells by the defined factors. Here, we demonstrated that the overexpression of DAZL, DAZ2, and BOULE could directly reprogram human Sertoli cells into cells with the characteristics of human spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), as shown by their similar transcriptomes and proteomics with human SSCs. Significantly, human SSCs derived from human Sertoli cells colonized and proliferated in vivo, and they could differentiate into spermatocytes and haploid spermatids in vitro. Human Sertoli cell-derived SSCs excluded Y chromosome microdeletions and assumed normal chromosomes. Collectively, human somatic cells could be converted directly to human SSCs with the self-renewal and differentiation potentials and high safety. This study is of unusual significance, because it provides an effective approach for reprogramming human somatic cells into male germ cells and offers invaluable male gametes for treating male infertility.

Abstract: Summary
Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade may be efficacious in some individuals with high-risk, resectable oral cavity head and neck cancer. To explore correlates of response patterns to neoadjuvant nivolumab treatment and post-surgical recurrences, we analyzed longitudinal tumor and blood samples in a cohort of 12 individuals displaying 33% responsiveness. Pretreatment tumor-based detection of FLT4 mutations and PTEN signature enrichment favors response, and high tumor mutational burden improves recurrence-free survival. In contrast, preexisting and/or acquired mutations (in CDKN2A, YAP1, or JAK2) correlate with innate resistance and/or tumor recurrence. Immunologically, tumor response after therapy entails T cell receptor repertoire diversification in peripheral blood and intratumoral expansion of preexisting T cell clones. A high ratio of regulatory T to T helper 17 cells in pretreatment blood predicts low T cell receptor repertoire diversity in pretreatment blood, a low cytolytic T cell signature in pretreatment tumors, and innate resistance. Our study provides a molecular framework to advance neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy for individuals with resectable head and neck cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Bile acids (BAs) facilitate intestinal fat absorption and act as important signaling molecules in host-gut microbiota crosstalk. BA-metabolizing pathways in the microbial community have been identified, but it remains largely unknown how the highly variable genomes of gut bacteria interact with host BA metabolism. We characterized 8,282 structural variants (SVs) of 55 bacterial species in the gut microbiomes of 1,437 individuals from two cohorts and performed a systematic association study with 39 plasma BA parameters. Both variations in SV-based continuous genetic makeup and discrete clusters showed correlations with BA metabolism. Metagenome-wide association analysis identified 809 replicable associations between bacterial SVs and BAs and SV regulators that mediate the effects of lifestyle factors on BA metabolism. This is the largest microbial genetic association analysis to demonstrate the impact of bacterial SVs on human BA composition, and it highlights the potential of targeting gut microbiota to regulate BA metabolism through lifestyle intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative condition characterized by the loss of motor neurons. We utilized single-cell transcriptomics to uncover dysfunctional pathways in degenerating motor neurons differentiated from SOD1 E100G ALS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and respective isogenic controls. Differential gene expression and network analysis identified activation of developmental pathways and core transcriptional factors driving the ALS motor neuron gene dysregulation. Specifically, we identified activation of SMAD2, a downstream mediator of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway as a key driver of SOD1 iPSC-derived motor neuron degeneration. Importantly, our analysis indicates that activation of TGFβ signaling may be a common mechanism shared between SOD1, FUS, C9ORF72, VCP, and sporadic ALS motor neurons. Our results demonstrate the utility of single-cell transcriptomics in mapping disease-relevant gene regulatory networks driving neurodegeneration in ALS motor neurons. We find that ALS-associated mutant SOD1 targets transcriptional networks that perturb motor neuron homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
These preliminary data from an ongoing first-in-human phase 1/2, open-label study provide proof-of-concept that pluripotent stem cell-derived pancreatic endoderm cells (PEC-01) engrafted in type 1 diabetes patients become islet cells releasing insulin in a physiologically regulated fashion. In this study of 17 subjects aged 22-57 with type 1 diabetes, PEC-01 cells were implanted subcutaneously in VC-02 macroencapsulation devices, allowing for direct vascularization of the cells. Engraftment and insulin expression were observed in 63% of VC-02 units explanted from subjects at 3–12 months post-implant. Six of 17 subjects (35.3%) demonstrated positive C-peptide as early as 6 months post-implant. Most reported adverse events were related to surgical implant or explant procedures (27.9%) or to side-effects of immunosuppression (33.7%). Initial data suggest that pluripotent stem cells, which can be propagated to the desired biomass and differentiated into pancreatic islet-like tissue, may offer a scalable, renewable alternative to pancreatic islet transplants.

Abstract: Summary
Dyslipidemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), a major cause of death worldwide. Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), recognized as a new therapeutic target for dyslipidemia, regulates the metabolism of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides. Here, we design 3 epitopes (E1-E3) for use in development of a peptide vaccine targeting ANGPTL3 and estimate effects of each on obesity-associated dyslipidemia in B6.Cg-Lepob/J (ob/ob) mice. Vaccination with the E3 (32EPKSRFAMLD41) peptide significantly reduces circulating levels of triglycerides, LDL-C, and small dense (sd)-LDL-C in ob/ob mice and decreases obese-induced fatty liver. Moreover, E3 vaccination does not induce cytotoxicity in ob/ob mice. Interestingly, the effect of E3 vaccination on dyslipidemia attenuates development of atherosclerosis in B6.KOR/StmSlc-Apoeshl mice fed a high-cholesterol diet, which represent a model of severe familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) caused by ApoE loss of function. Taken together, ANGPTL3 vaccination could be an effective therapeutic strategy against dyslipidemia and associated diseases.

Abstract: Rapid proliferation, high stemness potential, high invasiveness and apoptotic evasion are the distinctive hallmarks of glioma malignancy. The dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is the key factor regulating glioma malignancy. Wnt antagonist, secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4), which has a prominent pro-apoptotic role in glioma stem cells, has two functional domains, the netrin-like domain (NLD), and cysteine-rich domain (CRD) both of which contribute to apoptotic properties of the whole protein. However, there are no reports elucidating the specific effects of individual domains of sFRP4 in inhibiting the invasive properties of glioma. This study explores the efficacy of the domains of sFRP4 in inhibiting the key hallmarks of glioblastoma such as invasion, metastasis, and stemness. We overexpressed sFRP4 and its domains in the glioblastoma cell line, U87MG cells and observed that both CRD and NLD domains played prominent roles in attenuating cancer stem cell properties. Significantly, we could demonstrate for the first time that both NLD and CRD domains negatively impacted the key driver of metastasis and migration, the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Mechanistically, compared to CRD, NLD domain suppressed MMP-2 mediated invasion more effectively in glioma cells as observed in matrigel invasion assay and a function-blocking antibody assay. Fluorescent matrix degradation assay further revealed that NLD reduces matrix degradation. NLD also significantly disrupted fibronectin assembly and decreased cell adhesion in another glioma cell line LN229. In conclusion, the NLD peptide of sFRP4 could be a potent short peptide therapeutic candidate for targeting MMP-2-mediated invasion in the highly malignant glioblastoma multiforme.

Alleviation of CCCP-induced mitochondrial injury by augmenter of liver regeneration via the PINK1/Parkin pathway-dependent mitophagy,

Abstract: The occurrence of liver diseases is attributed to mitochondrial damage. Mitophagy selectively removes dysfunctional mitochondria, thereby preserving mitochondrial function. Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) protects the mitochondria from injury. However, whether ALR protection is associated with mitophagy remains unclear. In this study, mitochondrial damage was induced by carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and long-form ALR (lfRNA)-mediated protection against this damage was investigated. Treatment of HepG2 cells with CCCP elevated the level of intracellular ROS, inhibited ATP production, and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential and cell apoptotic rate. However, in lfALR-transfected cells, CCCP-induced cell injury was clearly alleviated, the apoptosis and ROS levels clearly declined, and the ATP production was significantly enhanced as compared with that in vector-Tx cells. Furthermore, lfALR overexpression promoted autophagy and mitophagy via a PINK1/Parkin-dependent pathway, whereas knockdown of ALR suppressed mitophagy. In lfALR-transfected cells, the phosphorylation of AKT was decreased, thus, downregulating the phosphorylation of the transcription factor FOXO3a at Ser315. In contrast, the phosphorylation of AMPK was enhanced, thereby upregulating the phosphorylation of FOXO3a at Ser413. Consequently, FOXO3a′s nuclear translocation and binding to the promoter region of PINK1 was enhanced, and the accumulation of PINK1/Parkin in mitochondria increased. Meanwhile, short-form ALR (sfALR) also increased PINK1 expression through FOXO3a with the similar pathway to lfALR. In conclusion, our data suggest a novel mechanism through which both lfALR and sfALR protect mitochondria by promoting PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy through FOXO3a activation.

Abstract: Summary
Tolerance and persistence are superficially similar phenomena by which bacteria survive bactericidal antibiotics. It is assumed that the same physiology underlies survival of individual tolerant and persistent bacteria. However, by comparing tolerance and persistence during Salmonella Typhimurium infection, we reveal that these two phenomena are underpinned by different bacterial physiologies. Multidrug-tolerant mutant Salmonella enter a near-dormant state protected from immune-mediated genotoxic damages. However, the numerous tolerant cells, optimized for survival, lack the capabilities necessary to initiate infection relapse following antibiotic withdrawal. In contrast, persisters retain an active state. This leaves them vulnerable to accumulation of macrophage-induced dsDNA breaks but concurrently confers the versatility to initiate infection relapse if protected by RecA-mediated DNA repair. Accordingly, recurrent, invasive, non-typhoidal Salmonella clinical isolates display hallmarks of persistence rather than tolerance during antibiotic treatment. Our study highlights the complex trade-off that antibiotic-recalcitrant Salmonella balance to act as a reservoir for infection relapse.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a central role in the progression of liver fibrosis by producing extracellular matrices. The development of drugs to suppress liver fibrosis has been hampered by the lack of human quiescent HSCs (qHSCs) and an appropriate in vitro model that faithfully recapitulates HSC activation. In the present study, we developed a culture system to generate qHSC-like cells from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that can be converted into activated HSCs in culture. To monitor the activation process, a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene was inserted in hiPSCs downstream of the activation marker gene actin alpha 2 smooth muscle (ACTA2). Using qHSC-like cells derived from RFP reporter iPSCs, we screened a repurposing chemical library and identified therapeutic candidates that prevent liver fibrosis. Hence, hiPSC-derived qHSC-like cells will be a useful tool to study the mechanism of HSC activation and to identify therapeutic agents.

Abstract: Summary
Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) are natural biosensors generating electrical signals in response to the binding of specific ligands. Creating de novo LGICs for biosensing applications is technically challenging. We have previously designed modified LGICs by linking G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the Kir6.2 channel. In this article, we extrapolate these design concepts to other channels with different structures and oligomeric states, namely a tetrameric viral Kcv channel and the dimeric mouse TREK-1 channel. After precise engineering of the linker regions, the two ion channels were successfully regulated by a GPCR fused to their N-terminal domain. Two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings showed that Kcv and mTREK-1 fusions were inhibited and activated by GPCR agonists, respectively, and antagonists abolished both effects. Thus, dissimilar ion channels can be allosterically regulated through their N-terminal domains, suggesting that this is a generalizable approach for ion channel engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) dissemination to the central nervous system (CNS) is a challenging clinical problem whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that primary human ALL samples injected into the femora of immunodeficient mice migrate to the skull and vertebral bone marrow and provoke bone lesions that enable passage into the subarachnoid space. Treatment of leukemia xenografted mice with a biologic antagonist of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) blocks this entry route. In addition to erosion of cranial and vertebral bone, samples from individuals with B-ALL also penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier of recipient mice. Co-administration of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and RANKL antagonists attenuate both identified routes of entry.

Abstract: Heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) is an essential molecular chaperone in eukaryotes that plays a vital role in protecting and maintaining the functional integrity of deregulated signaling proteins in tumors. We have previously reported that the stability and activity of the mitotic checkpoint kinase Mps1 depend on Hsp90. In turn, Mps1-mediated phosphorylation Hsp90 regulates its chaperone function and is essential for the mitotic arrest. Cdc14-assisted dephosphorylation of Hsp90 is vital for the mitotic exit. Post-translational regulation of Hsp90 function is also known as the Hsp90 “Chaperone Code.” Here, we demonstrate that only the active Mps1 is ubiquitinated on K86, K827, and K848 by the tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) containing E3 enzyme, in a prolyl hydroxylation-independent manner and degraded in the proteasome. Furthermore, we show that this process regulates cell exit from the mitotic checkpoint. Collectively, our data demonstrates an interplay between the Hsp90 chaperone and VHL degradation machinery in regulating mitosis.

Abstract: Mitochondria are autonomous and dynamic cellular organelles orchestrating a diverse range of cellular activities. Numerous cell-signaling pathways target these organelles and Ca2+ is one of the most significant. Mitochondria are able to rapidly and transiently take up Ca2+, thanks to the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complex, as well as to extrude it through the Na+/Ca2+ and H+/Ca2+ exchangers. The transient accumulation of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix impacts on mitochondrial functions and cell pathophysiology. Here we summarize the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling in both physiological (yang) and pathological (yin) processes and the methods that can be used to investigate mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis. As an example of the pivotal role of mitochondria in pathology, we described the state of the art of mitochondrial Ca2+ alterations in different pathological conditions, with a special focus on Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is generally accepted as a chronic inflammatory disease and is the most important pathological process underlying the cardiovascular diseases. MiR-22 exerts an important role in tumorgenesis, obesity and NAFLD development, as well as cardiovascular diseases. However, a certain role of miR-22 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remains undetermined. Here, we showed that miR-22 exhibited a negative association with the deteriorated atherosclerotic plaque and showed significant downregulated expression in macrophages. Next, treatment of ApoE deficiency (ApoE−/-) mice with miR-22 inhibitors which were then subjected to high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks were performed to investigate the function of miR-22 on atherogenesis. The results exhibited that miR-22 inhibition dramatically promoted atherosclerotic plaques but attenuated plaque stabilization which were accompanied by decreased smooth muscle cell and collagen content, but increased macrophage infiltration and lipid accumulation. More importantly, the in vivo and in vitro experiments suggested that miR-22 inhibition accelerated inflammatory response and foam cell formation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated interferon regulator factor 5 (IRF5) was an important target of miR-22 and it was required for the regulation of inflammation mediated by miR-22 inhibition. Collectively, these evidences revealed that miR-22 inhibition promoted the atherosclerosis progression through activation of IRF5.

Abstract: Summary
New neurons are abnormal in the adult hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models. The effects of modulating adult neurogenesis on AD pathogenesis differ from study to study. We reported recently that ablation of adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) was associated with improved memory in AD models. Here, we found that long-term potentiation (LTP) was improved in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice after ablation of aNSCs. This effect was confirmed in hAPP-J20 mice, a second AD mouse model. On the other hand, we found that exposure to enriched environment (EE) dramatically increased the number of DCX+ neurons, promoted dendritic growth, and affected the location of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of APP/PS1 mice, and EE exposure significantly ameliorated memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice. Together, our data suggest that both inhibiting abnormal adult neurogenesis and enhancing healthy adult neurogenesis could be beneficial for AD, and they are not mutually exclusive.

Abstract: Summary
Voltage-gated sodium channels initiate electrical signals and are frequently targeted by deadly gating-modifier neurotoxins, including tarantula toxins, which trap the voltage sensor in its resting state. The structural basis for tarantula-toxin action remains elusive because of the difficulty of capturing the functionally relevant form of the toxin-channel complex. Here, we engineered the model sodium channel NaVAb with voltage-shifting mutations and the toxin-binding site of human NaV1.7, an attractive pain target. This mutant chimera enabled us to determine the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the channel functionally arrested by tarantula toxin. Our structure reveals a high-affinity resting-state-specific toxin-channel interaction between a key lysine residue that serves as a “stinger” and penetrates a triad of carboxyl groups in the S3-S4 linker of the voltage sensor. By unveiling this high-affinity binding mode, our studies establish a high-resolution channel-docking and resting-state locking mechanism for huwentoxin-IV and provide guidance for developing future resting-state-targeted analgesic drugs.

Abstract: Although stem cell aging leads to a decline in tissue homeostasis and regenerative capacity, it remains unclear whether salivary gland stem cell function changes during this process. However, the salivary glands are gradually replaced by connective tissue during aging. Here, we show a decline in the stem cell ability of CD133-positive stem/progenitor cells in the salivary glands of aged mice. The CD133-positive cells were isolated from young, adult, and aged mice. The number of CD133-positive cells was significantly decreased in aged mice. They also showed a lower sphere formation capacity compared to young and adult mice. RNA sequencing revealed that CD133-positive cells in aged mice exhibited lower gene expression of several aging-related genes, including FoxO3a, than those in young and adult mice. Salivary gland cells infected with a recombinant lentivirus encoding the FoxO3a gene showed a reduction in oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide compared with those infected with a control virus. Thus, FoxO3a may inhibit stem cell aging via oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
High-resolution and rapid imaging of host cell ultrastructure can generate insights toward viral disease mechanism, for example for a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here, we employ full-rotation soft X-ray tomography (SXT) to examine organelle remodeling induced by SARS-CoV-2 at the whole-cell level with high spatial resolution and throughput. Most of the current SXT systems suffer from a restricted field of view due to use of flat sample supports and artifacts due to missing data. In this approach using cylindrical sample holders, a full-rotation tomogram of human lung epithelial cells is performed in less than 10 min. We demonstrate the potential of SXT imaging by visualizing aggregates of SARS-CoV-2 virions and virus-induced intracellular alterations. This rapid whole-cell imaging approach allows us to visualize the spatiotemporal changes of cellular organelles upon viral infection in a quantitative manner.

Abstract: Promoting angiogenesis by targeting various angiogenic regulators has emerged as a new treatment strategy for myocardial ischemia (MI). MicroRNA-126 (miR-126) has been identified as the main regulator of compensatory angiogenesis; however, its role in MI is unclear. A rat MI model and an EA. hy926 endothelial cell hypoxia model were constructed and it was found that miR-126 was highly expressed in both models. The knockdown of HIF-1α expression in EA. hy926 cells in turn downregulated VEGF and CD34 expression and consequently inhibited angiogenesis. MiR-126 inhibitor inhibited EA. hy926 cell migration and tube formation as well as downregulated VEGF and CD34 expression, and these were reversed by transfection of miR-126 mimics. Rescue tests using miR-126 and HIF-1α demonstrated that miR-126-mediated regulation of angiogenesis was dependent on HIF-1α. In summary, miR-126 regulates the occurrence and progression of angiogenesis during MI via HIF-1α and may be a potential new therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Previous work found that the co-occurring mutations R203K/G204R on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein are increasing in frequency among emerging variants of concern or interest. Through a combination of in silico analyses, this study demonstrates that R203K/G204R are adaptive, while large-scale phylogenetic analyses indicate that R203K/G204R associate with the emergence of the high-transmissibility SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7. Competition experiments suggest that the 203K/204R variants possess a replication advantage over the preceding R203/G204 variants, possibly related to ribonucleocapsid (RNP) assembly. Moreover, the 203K/204R virus shows increased infectivity in human lung cells and hamsters. Accordingly, we observe a positive association between increased COVID-19 severity and sample frequency of 203K/204R. Our work suggests that the 203K/204R mutations contribute to the increased transmission and virulence of select SARS-CoV-2 variants. In addition to mutations in the spike protein, mutations in the nucleocapsid protein are important for viral spreading during the pandemic.

Abstract: Summary
The primary objective of the FDA-led Sequencing and Quality Control Phase 2 (SEQC2) project is to develop standard analysis protocols and quality control metrics for use in DNA testing to enhance scientific research and precision medicine. This study reports a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) method that will enable more accurate detection of actionable mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) clinical specimens. To accomplish this, a synthetic internal standard spike-in was designed for each actionable mutation target, suitable for use in NGS following hybrid capture enrichment and unique molecular index (UMI) or non-UMI library preparation. When mixed with contrived ctDNA reference samples, internal standards enabled calculation of technical error rate, limit of blank, and limit of detection for each variant at each nucleotide position in each sample. True-positive mutations with variant allele fraction too low for detection by current practice were detected with this method, thereby increasing sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Provoked by sterile/nonsterile insults, prolonged monocyte mobilization and uncontrolled monocyte/macrophage activation can pose imminent or impending harm to the affected organs. Curiously, folate receptor beta (FRβ), with subnanomolar affinity for the vitamin folic acid (FA), is upregulated during immune activation in hematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage. This phenomenon has inspired a strong interest in exploring FRβ-directed diagnostics/therapeutics. Previously, we have reported that FA-targeted aminopterin (AMT) therapy can modulate macrophage function and effectively treat animal models of inflammation. Our current investigation of a lead compound (EC2319) leads to discovery of a highly FR-specific mechanism of action independent of the root causes against inflammatory monocytes. We further show that EC2319 suppresses interleukin-6/interleukin-1β release by FRβ+ monocytes in a triple co-culture leukemic model of cytokine release syndrome with anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Because of its chemical stability and metabolically activated linker, EC2319 demonstrates favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics and cross-species translatability to support future pre-clinical and clinical development.

Abstract: Summary
Saccharibacteria (TM7) are obligate epibionts living on the surface of their host bacteria and are strongly correlated with dysbiotic microbiomes during periodontitis and other inflammatory diseases, suggesting they are putative pathogens. However, due to the recalcitrance of TM7 cultivation, causal research to investigate their role in inflammatory diseases is lacking. Here, we isolated multiple TM7 species on their host bacteria from periodontitis patients. These TM7 species reduce inflammation and consequential bone loss by modulating host bacterial pathogenicity in a mouse ligature-induced periodontitis model. Two host bacterial functions involved in collagen binding and utilization of eukaryotic sialic acid are required for inducing bone loss and are altered by TM7 association. This TM7-mediated downregulation of host bacterial pathogenicity is shown for multiple TM7/host bacteria pairs, suggesting that, in contrast to their suspected pathogenic role, TM7 could protect mammalian hosts from inflammatory damage induced by their host bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
Peanut allergy can result in life-threatening reactions and is a major public health concern. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) induces desensitization to food allergens through administration of increasing amounts of allergen. To dissect peanut-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG responses in subjects undergoing OIT, we have developed AllerScan, a method that leverages phage-display and next-generation sequencing to identify the epitope targets of peanut-specific antibodies. We observe a striking diversification and boosting of the peanut-specific IgG repertoire after OIT and a reduction in pre-existing IgE levels against individual epitopes. High-resolution epitope mapping reveals shared recognition of public epitopes in Ara h 1, 2, 3, and 7. In individual subjects, OIT-induced IgG specificities overlap extensively with IgE and exhibit strikingly similar antibody footprints, suggesting related clonal lineages or convergent evolution of peanut-specific IgE and IgG B cells. Individual differences in epitope recognition identified via AllerScan could inform safer and more effective personalized immunotherapy.

Abstract: The nuclear matrix-associated protein Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU), also known as SAF-A, is known to maintain active chromatin structure in mouse hepatocytes. However, the functional roles and molecular mechanisms of HNRNPU in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. Herein, we found that HNRNPU was upregulated in HCC, and the proliferation of HCC cells was inhibited in vitro and in vivo upon HNRNPU knockdown. Moreover, the upregulation of HNRNPU was correlated with poor prognosis in HCC. Mechanistically, HNRNPU bound to the CDK2 gene locus, a key factor in cell cycle regulation, where it was enriched with H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac), H3K9 acetylation (H3K9ac), and H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1). Furthermore, HNRNPU knockdown reduced the levels of H3K27ac and H3K9ac at the binding site, where the levels of H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) were increased, eventually leading to the downregulation of CDK2. Collectively, our results provide a new mechanism whereby HNRNPU promotes HCC development by enhancing the transcription of CDK2.

Abstract: Summary
miRNAs have crucial functions in many biological processes and are candidate biomarkers of disease. Here, we show that miR-216a is a conserved, pancreas-specific miRNA with important roles in pancreatic islet and acinar cells. Deletion of miR-216a in mice leads to a reduction in islet size, β-cell mass, and insulin levels. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a subpopulation of β-cells with upregulated acinar cell markers under a high-fat diet. miR-216a is induced by TGF-β signaling, and inhibition of miR-216a increases apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation in pancreatic cells. Deletion of miR-216a in the pancreatic cancer-prone mouse line KrasG12D;Ptf1aCreER reduces the propensity of pancreatic cancer precursor lesions. Notably, circulating miR-216a levels are elevated in both mice and humans with pancreatic cancer. Collectively, our study gives insights into how β-cell mass and acinar cell growth are modulated by a pancreas-specific miRNA and also suggests miR-216a as a potential biomarker for diagnosis of pancreatic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Generalizability of deep-learning (DL) model performance is not well understood and uses anecdotal assumptions for increasing training data to improve segmentation of medical images. We report statistical methods for visual interpretation of DL models trained using ImageNet initialization with natural-world (TII) and supervised learning with medical images (LMI) for binary segmentation of skin cancer, prostate tumors, and kidneys. An algorithm for computation of Dice scores from union and intersections of individual output masks was developed for synergistic segmentation by TII and LMI models. Stress testing with non-Gaussian distributions of infrequent clinical labels and images showed that sparsity of natural-world and domain medical images can counterintuitively reduce type I and type II errors of DL models. A toolkit of 30 TII and LMI models, code, and visual outputs of 59,967 images is shared to identify the target and non-target medical image pixels and clinical labels to explain the performance of DL models.

Abstract: In lactating mammary glands, alveolar mammary epithelial cells (MECs) produce milk and form less-permeable tight junctions (TJs). However, alveolar TJs are weakened with a reduction in milk production in mammary glands due to mastitis or weaning in the presence of high levels of IL-1β, IL-6, or TNF-α. In this study, using in vitro cultured model of MECs with milk-producing ability and lactation-specific TJs, we investigated whether the aforementioned cytokines affect MEC TJs. The results showed that TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 affected lactation-specific TJs in different ways. In particular, upon activation of p38 and JNK signalling, IL-1β caused rapid disruption of TJs at tricellular contact points. IL-1β treatment led to decreased CLDN3, CLDN4, and OCLN levels and a weakened TJ barrier. The adverse effects of IL-1β on TJs were mimicked by anisomycin, which is an activator of p38 and JNK signalling, and were blocked by MEC pretreatment with a p38 inhibitor but not a JNK inhibitor. The mislocalization of tricellulin at tricellular contact areas was confirmed in MECs treated with IL-1β or anisomycin. These results indicate that IL-1β is a key cytokine that adversely affects the TJs between MECs by activating p38.

Abstract: Summary
Second generation (2G) chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) contain a CD28 or 41BB co-stimulatory endodomain and elicit remarkable efficacy in hematological malignancies. Third generation (3G) CARs extend this linear blueprint by fusing both co-stimulatory units in series. However, clinical impact has been muted despite compelling evidence that co-signaling by CD28 and 41BB can powerfully amplify natural immune responses. We postulate that effective dual co-stimulation requires juxta-membrane positioning of endodomain components within separate synthetic receptors. Consequently, we designed parallel (p)CARs in which a 2G (CD28+CD3ζ) CAR is co-expressed with a 41BB-containing chimeric co-stimulatory receptor. We demonstrate that the pCAR platform optimally harnesses synergistic and tumor-dependent co-stimulation to resist T cell exhaustion and senescence, sustaining proliferation, cytokine release, cytokine signaling, and metabolic fitness upon repeated stimulation. When engineered using targeting moieties of diverse composition, affinity, and specificity, pCAR T cells consistently elicit superior anti-tumor activity compared with T cells that express traditional linear CARs.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. CLEC12B, a C-type lectin-like receptor, is low-expressed in lung cancer tissues. However, the function of CLEC12B in lung cancer and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. Here, an obvious down-regulation of CLEC12B was observed in lung cancer cells compared with the normal lung epithelial cells. CLEC12B over-expression suppressed cell viability and cell cycle entry in lung cancer, along with the reduction of PCNA and cyclin D1 expressions, while silencing CLEC12B possessed the opposite effects. Over-expression of CLEC12B promoted lung cancer cell apoptosis, accompanied by decreased Bcl-2 and increased Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9. Moreover, CLEC12B decreased phosphorylation of PI3K-p85 and AKT proteins. By contrast, CLEC12B knockdown activated the PI3K/AKT pathway. In vivo, CLEC12B inhibited tumor growth in lung cancer, which can be reversed by CLEC12B inhibition. Co-IP and immunofluorescence assays confirmed the interaction between CLEC12B and SHP-1, and CLEC12B over-expression increased SHP-1 level. Furthermore, knocking down SHP-1 abrogated the above biological phenotypes caused by CLEC12B elevation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that CLEC12B serves as a tumor-suppressing gene in lung cancer through positively regulating SHP-1 expression, which may be mediated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a key regulator of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol metabolism and the target of lipid-lowering drugs. PCSK9 is mainly expressed in hepatocytes. Here, we show that PCSK9 is highly expressed in undifferentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). PCSK9 inhibition in hiPSCs with the use of short hairpin RNA (shRNA), CRISPR/cas9-mediated knockout, or endogenous PCSK9 loss-of-function mutation R104C/V114A unveiled its new role as a potential cell cycle regulator through the NODAL signaling pathway. In fact, PCSK9 inhibition leads to a decrease of SMAD2 phosphorylation and hiPSCs proliferation. Conversely, PCSK9 overexpression stimulates hiPSCs proliferation. PCSK9 can interfere with the NODAL pathway by regulating the expression of its endogenous inhibitor DACT2, which is involved in transforming growth factor (TGF) β-R1 lysosomal degradation. Using different PCSK9 constructs, we show that PCSK9 interacts with DACT2 through its Cys-His-rich domain (CHRD) domain. Altogether these data highlight a new role of PCSK9 in cellular proliferation and development.
