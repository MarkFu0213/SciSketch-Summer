Abstract: Summary
Adult stem cells (SCs) transit between the cell cycle and a poorly defined quiescent state. Single neural SCs (NSCs) with quiescent, primed-for-activation, and activated cell transcriptomes have been obtained from the subependymal zone (SEZ), but the functional regulation of these states under homeostasis is not understood. Here, we develop a multilevel strategy to analyze these NSC states with the aim to uncover signals that regulate their level of quiescence/activation. We show that transitions between states occur in vivo and that activated and primed, but not quiescent, states can be captured and studied in culture. We also show that peripherally induced inflammation promotes a transient activation of primed NSCs (pNSCs) mediated by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) acting through its receptor, TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), and a return to quiescence in a TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)-dependent manner. Our data identify a signaling pathway promoting NSC alertness and add to the emerging concept that SCs can respond to the systemic milieu.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing introduces an additional layer of protein diversity and complexity in regulating cellular functions that can be specific to the tissue and cell type, physiological state of a cell, or disease phenotype. Recent high-throughput experimental studies have illuminated the functional role of splicing events through rewiring protein-protein interactions; however, the extent to which the macromolecular interactions are affected by alternative splicing has yet to be fully understood. In silico methods provide a fast and cheap alternative to interrogating functional characteristics of thousands of alternatively spliced isoforms. Here, we develop an accurate feature-based machine learning approach that predicts whether a protein-protein interaction carried out by a reference isoform is perturbed by an alternatively spliced isoform. Our method, called the alternatively spliced interactions prediction (ALT-IN) tool, is compared with the state-of-the-art PPI prediction tools and shows superior performance, achieving 0.92 in precision and recall values.

Abstract: Summary
Human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibit attrition of their self-renewal capacity when cultured ex vivo, a process that is partially reversed upon treatment with epigenetic modifiers, most notably inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs) or lysine-specific demethylase LSD1. A recent study showed that the human HSC self-renewal agonist UM171 modulates the CoREST complex, leading to LSD1 degradation, whose inhibition mimics the activity of UM171. The mechanism underlying the UM171-mediated loss of CoREST function remains undetermined. We now report that UM171 potentiates the activity of a CULLIN3-E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex whose target specificity is dictated by the poorly characterized Kelch/BTB domain protein KBTBD4. CRL3KBTBD4 targets components of the LSD1/RCOR1 corepressor complex for proteasomal degradation, hence re-establishing H3K4me2 and H3K27ac epigenetic marks, which are rapidly decreased upon ex vivo culture of human HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Cell fate transitions are frequently accompanied by changes in cell shape and mechanics. However, how cellular mechanics affects the instructive signaling pathways controlling cell fate is poorly understood. To probe the interplay between shape, mechanics, and fate, we use mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which change shape as they undergo early differentiation. We find that shape change is regulated by a β-catenin-mediated decrease in RhoA activity and subsequent decrease in the plasma membrane tension. Strikingly, preventing a decrease in membrane tension results in early differentiation defects in ESCs and gastruloids. Decreased membrane tension facilitates the endocytosis of FGF signaling components, which activate ERK signaling and direct the exit from the ESC state. Increasing Rab5a-facilitated endocytosis rescues defective early differentiation. Thus, we show that a mechanically triggered increase in endocytosis regulates early differentiation. Our findings are of fundamental importance for understanding how cell mechanics regulates biochemical signaling and therefore cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are characterized by high rates of recurrence and poor clinical outcomes. Deregulated E3 ligases are involved in breast cancer pathogenesis and progression, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we find that F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 16 (FBXL16) acts as a tumor suppressor in TNBCs. FBXL16 directly binds to HIF1α and induces its ubiquitination and degradation, regardless of the tumor microenvironment, resulting in blockade of the HIF1α-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis features of breast cancer. In TNBCs, FBXL16 expression is downregulated by the p38/miR-135b-3p axis, and loss of FBXL16 expression restores HIF1α-mediated metastatic features of breast cancer. Low expression of FBXL16 is associated with high-grade and lymph node-positive tumors and poor overall survival of breast cancer. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that modulation of FBXL16 expression may offer a favorable strategy for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer, including TNBCs.

Abstract: Summary
Variability of synapse numbers and partners despite identical genes reveals the limits of genetic determinism. Here, we use developmental temperature as a non-genetic perturbation to study variability of brain wiring and behavior in Drosophila. Unexpectedly, slower development at lower temperatures increases axo-dendritic branching, synapse numbers, and non-canonical synaptic partnerships of various neurons, while maintaining robust ratios of canonical synapses. Using R7 photoreceptors as a model, we show that changing the relative availability of synaptic partners using a DIPγ mutant that ablates R7’s preferred partner leads to temperature-dependent recruitment of non-canonical partners to reach normal synapse numbers. Hence, R7 synaptic specificity is not absolute but based on the relative availability of postsynaptic partners and presynaptic control of synapse numbers. Behaviorally, movement precision is temperature robust, while movement activity is optimized for the developmentally encountered temperature. These findings suggest genetically encoded relative and scalable synapse formation to develop functional, but not identical, brains and behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Toxic amyloid beta (Aβ) species cause synaptic dysfunction and neurotoxicity in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). As of yet, however, there are no reported regulators for gamma-secretase, which links a risky environment to amyloid accumulation in AD. Here, we report that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a positive regulator of gamma-secretase under hypoxia. From a genome-wide functional screen, we identify PKM2 as a gamma-secretase activator that is highly expressed in the brains of both patients and murine models with AD. PKM2 regulates Aβ production and the amount of active gamma-secretase complex by changing the gene expression of aph-1 homolog. Hypoxia induces PKM2 expression, thereby promoting gamma-secretase activity. Moreover, transgenic expression of PKM2 in 3xTg AD model mice enhances hippocampal production of Aβ and exacerbates the impairment of spatial and recognition memory. Taken together, these findings indicate that PKM2 is an important gamma-secretase regulator that promotes Aβ production and memory impairment under hypoxia.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic pain is a prevalent medical problem, and its molecular basis remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the significance of the transmembrane protein (Tmem) 160 for nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. An extensive behavioral assessment suggests a pain modality- and entity-specific phenotype in male Tmem160 global knockout (KO) mice: delayed establishment of tactile hypersensitivity and alterations in self-grooming after nerve injury. In contrast, Tmem160 seems to be dispensable for other nerve injury-induced pain modalities, such as non-evoked and movement-evoked pain, and for other pain entities. Mechanistically, we show that global KO males exhibit dampened neuroimmune signaling and diminished TRPA1-mediated activity in cultured dorsal root ganglia. Neither these changes nor altered pain-related behaviors are observed in global KO female and male peripheral sensory neuron-specific KO mice. Our findings reveal Tmem160 as a sexually dimorphic factor contributing to the establishment, but not maintenance, of discrete nerve injury-induced pain behaviors in male mice.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is associated with reduced fitness and increased myeloid bias of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment, causing increased risk of immune compromise, anemia, and malignancy. We show that mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) can be used to prospectively isolate chronologically old HSCs with transcriptional features and functional attributes characteristic of young HSCs, including a high rate of transcription and balanced lineage-affiliated programs. Strikingly, MMP is a stronger determinant of the quantitative and qualitative transcriptional state of HSCs than chronological age, and transcriptional consequences of manipulation of MMP in HSCs within their native niche suggest a causal relationship. Accordingly, we show that pharmacological enhancement of MMP in old HSCs in vivo increases engraftment potential upon transplantation and reverses myeloid-biased peripheral blood output at steady state. Our results demonstrate that MMP is a source of heterogeneity in old HSCs, and its pharmacological manipulation can alter transcriptional programs with beneficial consequences for function.

Abstract: Summary
The hippocampus is a temporal lobe structure critical for cognition, such as learning, memory, and attention, as well as emotional responses. Hippocampal dysfunction can lead to persistent anxiety and/or depression. However, how millions of neurons in the hippocampus are molecularly and structurally organized to engage their divergent functions remains unknown. Here, we genetically target a subset of neurons expressing the coagulation factor c homolog (COCH) gene. COCH-expressing neurons or COCH neurons are topographically segregated in the distal region of the ventral CA3 hippocampus and express Mtf1 and Cacna1h. MTF1 activation of Cacna1h transcription in COCH neurons encodes the ability of COCH neurons to burst action potentials and cause social-stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors by synapsing directly with a subset of GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the lateral septum. Together, this study provides a molecular and circuitry-based framework for understanding how COCH neurons in the hippocampus are assembled to engage social behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Writing and erasing of posttranslational modifications are crucial to phenotypic plasticity and antigenic variation of eukaryotic pathogens. Targeting pathogens’ modification machineries, thus, represents a valid approach to fighting parasitic diseases. However, identification of parasitic targets and the development of selective anti-parasitic drugs still represent major bottlenecks. Here, we show that the zinc-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are key regulators that have significantly diverged from their human counterparts. Depletion of T. cruzi class I HDACs tcDAC1 and tcDAC2 compromises cell-cycle progression and division, leading to cell death. Notably, tcDAC2 displays a deacetylase activity essential to the parasite and shows major structural differences with human HDACs. Specifically, tcDAC2 harbors a modular active site with a unique subpocket targeted by inhibitors showing substantial anti-parasitic effects in cellulo and in vivo. Thus, the targeting of the many atypical HDACs in pathogens can enable anti-parasitic selective chemical impairment.

Abstract: Summary
What percentage of the protein function is required to prevent disease symptoms is a fundamental question in genetic disorders. Decreased transsynaptic LGI1-ADAM22 protein complexes, because of their mutations or autoantibodies, cause epilepsy and amnesia. However, it remains unclear how LGI1-ADAM22 levels are regulated and how much LGI1-ADAM22 function is required. Here, by genetic and structural analysis, we demonstrate that quantitative dual phosphorylation of ADAM22 by protein kinase A (PKA) mediates high-affinity binding of ADAM22 to dimerized 14-3-3. This interaction protects LGI1-ADAM22 from endocytosis-dependent degradation. Accordingly, forskolin-induced PKA activation increases ADAM22 levels. Leveraging a series of ADAM22 and LGI1 hypomorphic mice, we find that ∼50% of LGI1 and ∼10% of ADAM22 levels are sufficient to prevent lethal epilepsy. Furthermore, ADAM22 function is required in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. These results suggest strategies to increase LGI1-ADAM22 complexes over the required levels by targeting PKA or 14-3-3 for epilepsy treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Related to ABI3/VP1 (RAV) transcription factors have important roles in plant stress responses; however, it is unclear whether RAVs regulates oxidative stress response in cassava (Manihot esculenta). In this study, we report that MeRAV1/2 positively regulate oxidative stress resistance and catalase (CAT) activity in cassava. Consistently, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identifies three MeCATs that are differentially expressed in MeRAV1/2-silenced cassava leaves. Interestingly, MeCAT6 and MeCAT7 are identified as direct transcriptional targets of MeRAV1/2 via binding to their promoters. In addition, protein kinase MeKIN10 directly interacts with MeRAV1/2 to phosphorylate them at Ser45 and Ser44 residues, respectively, to promote their direct transcriptional activation on MeCAT6 and MeCAT7. Site mutation of MeRAV1S45A or MeRAV2S44A has no significant effect on the activities of MeCAT6 and MeCAT7 promoters or on oxidative stress resistance. In summary, this study demonstrates that the phosphorylation of MeRAV1/2 by MeKIN10 is essential for its direct transcriptional activation of MeCAT6/7 in response to oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Barrier tissue immune responses are regulated in part by nociceptors. Nociceptor ablation alters local immune responses at peripheral sites and within draining lymph nodes (LNs). The mechanisms and significance of nociceptor-dependent modulation of LN function are unknown. Using high-resolution imaging, viral tracing, single-cell transcriptomics, and optogenetics, we identified and functionally tested a sensory neuro-immune circuit that is responsive to lymph-borne inflammatory signals. Transcriptomics profiling revealed that multiple sensory neuron subsets, predominantly peptidergic nociceptors, innervate LNs, distinct from those innervating surrounding skin. To uncover LN-resident cells that may interact with LN-innervating sensory neurons, we generated a LN single-cell transcriptomics atlas and nominated nociceptor target populations and interaction modalities. Optogenetic stimulation of LN-innervating sensory fibers triggered rapid transcriptional changes in the predicted interacting cell types, particularly endothelium, stromal cells, and innate leukocytes. Thus, a unique population of sensory neurons monitors peripheral LNs and may locally regulate gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons are highly polarized cells that display characteristic differences in the organization of their organelles in axons and dendrites. The kinases SadA and SadB (SadA/B) promote the formation of distinct axonal and dendritic extensions during the development of cortical and hippocampal neurons. Here, we show that SadA/B are required for the specific dynamics of axonal mitochondria. Ankyrin B (AnkB) stimulates the activity of SadA/B that function as regulators of mitochondrial dynamics through the phosphorylation of tau. Suppression of SadA/B or AnkB in cortical neurons induces the elongation of mitochondria by disrupting the balance of fission and fusion. SadA/B-deficient neurons show an accumulation of hyper-fused mitochondria and activation of the integrated stress response (ISR). The normal dynamics of axonal mitochondria could be restored by mild actin destabilization. Thus, the elongation after loss of SadA/B results from an excessive stabilization of actin filaments and reduction of Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
Centrioles comprise the heart of centrosomes, microtubule-organizing centers. To study the function of centrioles in lung and gut development, we genetically disrupted centrioles throughout the mouse endoderm. Surprisingly, removing centrioles from the endoderm did not disrupt intestinal growth or development but blocked lung branching. In the lung, acentriolar SOX2-expressing airway epithelial cells apoptosed. Loss of centrioles activated p53, and removing p53 restored survival of SOX2-expressing cells, lung branching, and mouse viability. To investigate how endodermal p53 activation specifically killed acentriolar SOX2-expressing cells, we assessed ERK, a prosurvival cue. ERK was active throughout the intestine and in the distal lung buds, correlating with tolerance to centriole loss. Pharmacologically inhibiting ERK activated apoptosis in acentriolar cells, revealing that ERK activity protects acentriolar cells from apoptosis. Therefore, centrioles are largely dispensable for endodermal growth and the spatial distribution of ERK activity in the endoderm shapes the developmental consequences of centriolar defects and p53 activation.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory processing varies depending on behavioral context. Here, we ask how task engagement modulates neurons in the auditory system. We train mice in a simple tone-detection task and compare their neuronal activity during passive hearing and active listening. Electrophysiological extracellular recordings in the inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body, primary auditory cortex, and anterior auditory field reveal widespread modulations across all regions and cortical layers and in both putative regular- and fast-spiking cortical neurons. Clustering analysis unveils ten distinct modulation patterns that can either enhance or suppress neuronal activity. Task engagement changes the tone-onset response in most neurons. Such modulations first emerge in subcortical areas, ruling out cortical feedback as the only mechanism underlying subcortical modulations. Half the neurons additionally display late modulations associated with licking, arousal, or reward. Our results reveal the presence of functionally distinct subclasses of neurons, differentially sensitive to specific task-related variables but anatomically distributed along the auditory pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Organoids are powerful models for studying tissue development, physiology, and disease. However, current culture systems disrupt the inductive tissue-tissue interactions needed for the complex morphogenetic processes of native organogenesis. Here, we show that mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can be coaxed to robustly undergo fundamental steps of early heart organogenesis with an in-vivo-like spatiotemporal fidelity. These axially patterned embryonic organoids (gastruloids) mimic embryonic development and support the generation of cardiovascular progenitors, including first and second heart fields. The cardiac progenitors self-organize into an anterior domain reminiscent of a cardiac crescent before forming a beating cardiac tissue near a putative primitive gut-like tube, from which it is separated by an endocardial-like layer.

Abstract: Summary
The functional and genomic diversity of the human gut microbiome is shaped by horizontal transfer of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Characterized MGEs can encode genes beneficial for their host’s self-defense (e.g., antibiotic resistance) or ability to compete for essential or limited resources (e.g., vitamins). Vitamin B12 and related compounds (corrinoids) are critical nutrients that enable colonization by members of the common gut microbe phylum, the Bacteroidetes. Herein, we identify a distinct class of MGEs in the Bacteroidetes responsible for the mobilization and exchange of the genes required for transport of corrinoids, a group of cyclic tetrapyrrole cofactors including vitamin B12 (btuGBFCD). This class includes two distinct groups of conjugative transposons (CTns) and one group of phage. Conjugative transfer and vitamin B12 transport activity of two of the CTns were confirmed in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the important role MGEs play in distribution of corrinoid transporters in the Bacteroidetes.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal bipolar cells are second-order neurons that transmit basic features of the visual scene to postsynaptic partners. However, their contribution to motion detection has not been fully appreciated. Here, we demonstrate that cholinergic feedback from starburst amacrine cells (SACs) to certain presynaptic bipolar cells via alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAChRs) promotes direction-selective signaling. Patch clamp recordings reveal that distinct bipolar cell types making synapses at proximal SAC dendrites also express α7-nAChRs, producing directionally skewed excitatory inputs. Asymmetric SAC excitation contributes to motion detection in On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells (On-Off DSGCs), predicted by computational modeling of SAC dendrites and supported by patch clamp recordings from On-Off DSGCs when bipolar cell α7-nAChRs is eliminated pharmacologically or by conditional knockout. Altogether, these results show that cholinergic feedback to bipolar cells enhances direction-selective signaling in postsynaptic SACs and DSGCs, illustrating how bipolar cells provide a scaffold for postsynaptic microcircuits to cooperatively enhance retinal motion detection.

Abstract: Summary
Treatments aiming to augment immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer often focus on T cell immunity, but innate immune cells may have important roles to play. Here, we demonstrate a single-dose combination treatment (termed AIP) using a pan-tumor-targeting antibody surrogate, half-life-extended interleukin-2 (IL-2), and anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), which primes tumors to respond to subsequent ICB and promotes rejection of large established tumors in mice. Natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages activated by AIP treatment underwent transcriptional reprogramming; rapidly killed cancer cells; governed the recruitment of cross-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) and other leukocytes; and induced normalization of the tumor vasculature, facilitating further immune infiltration. Thus, innate cell-activating therapies can initiate critical steps leading to a self-sustaining cycle of T cell priming driven by ICB.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia, the resident macrophages in the central nervous system, express receptors for classical neurotransmitters, such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, suggesting that they sense synaptic activity. To detect microglial Ca2+ responses to neuronal activity, we generate transgenic mouse lines expressing the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6m, specifically in microglia and demonstrate that electrical stimulation of the Schaffer collateral pathway results in microglial Ca2+ responses in early postnatal but not adult hippocampus. Preceding the microglial responses, we also observe similar Ca2+ responses in astrocytes, and both are sensitive to tetrodotoxin. Blocking astrocytic glutamate uptake or GABA transport abolishes stimulation-induced microglial responses as well as antagonizing the microglial GABAB receptor. Our data, therefore, suggest that the neuronal activity-induced glutamate uptake and the release of GABA by astrocytes trigger the activation of GABAB receptors in microglia. This neuron, astrocyte, and microglia communication pathway might modulate microglial activity in developing neuronal networks.

Abstract: Summary
Repair of genetic damage is coordinated in the context of chromatin, so cells dynamically modulate accessibility at DNA breaks for the recruitment of DNA damage response (DDR) factors. The identification of chromatin factors with roles in DDR has mostly relied on loss-of-function screens while lacking robust high-throughput systems to study DNA repair. In this study, we have developed two high-throughput systems that allow the study of DNA repair kinetics and the recruitment of factors to double-strand breaks in a 384-well plate format. Using a customized gain-of-function open-reading frame library (“ChromORFeome” library), we identify chromatin factors with putative roles in the DDR. Among these, we find the PHF20 factor is excluded from DNA breaks, affecting DNA repair by competing with 53BP1 recruitment. Adaptable for genetic perturbations, small-molecule screens, and large-scale analysis of DNA repair, these resources can aid our understanding and manipulation of DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
Neural crest (NC) cells migrate throughout vertebrate embryos to give rise to a huge variety of cell types, but when and where lineages emerge and their regulation remain unclear. We have performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of cranial NC cells from the first pharyngeal arch in zebrafish over several stages during migration. Computational analysis combining pseudotime and real-time data reveals that these NC cells first adopt a transitional state, becoming specified mid-migration, with the first lineage decisions being skeletal and pigment, followed by neural and glial progenitors. In addition, by computationally integrating these data with RNA-seq data from a transgenic Wnt reporter line, we identify gene cohorts with similar temporal responses to Wnts during migration and show that one, Atp6ap2, is required for melanocyte differentiation. Together, our results show that cranial NC cell lineages arise progressively and uncover a series of spatially restricted cell interactions likely to regulate such cell-fate decisions.

Abstract: Summary
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is causing a global pandemic, and cases continue to rise. Most infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that could contribute to immunity. We performed a longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered from mild COVID-19 to determine whether they develop and sustain multifaceted SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological memory. Recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies, neutralizing plasma, and memory B and memory T cells that persisted for at least 3 months. Our data further reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG memory B cells increased over time. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral function: memory T cells secreted cytokines and expanded upon antigen re-encounter, whereas memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks of antiviral immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a critical component of vaccines and a target for neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs). Spike is also undergoing immunogenic selection with variants that increase infectivity and partially escape convalescent plasma. Here, we describe Spike Display, a high-throughput platform to rapidly characterize glycosylated spike ectodomains across multiple coronavirus-family proteins. We assayed ∼200 variant SARS-CoV-2 spikes for their expression, ACE2 binding, and recognition by 13 nAbs. An alanine scan of all five N-terminal domain (NTD) loops highlights a public epitope in the N1, N3, and N5 loops recognized by most NTD-binding nAbs. NTD mutations in variants of concern B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), B.1.1.28 (gamma), B.1.427/B.1.429 (epsilon), and B.1.617.2 (delta) impact spike expression and escape most NTD-targeting nAbs. Finally, B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 completely escape a potent ACE2 mimic. We anticipate that Spike Display will accelerate antigen design, deep scanning mutagenesis, and antibody epitope mapping for SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viral threats.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor DNA-damage response (DDR) has an important role in driving type-I interferon (IFN)-mediated host antitumor immunity, but it is not clear how tumor DNA damage is interconnected with the immune response. Here, we report the role of IFN-γ-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) in DNA repair, which amplifies the stimulator of IFN genes (STING)-type-I IFN signaling, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). IFI16 is rapidly induced and accumulated to the histone-evicted DNA at double-stranded breakage (DSB) sites, where it inhibits recruitment of DDR factors. Subsequently, IFI16 increases the release of DNA fragments to the cytoplasm and induces STING-mediated type-I IFN production. Synergistic cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects of doxorubicin and type-I IFNs are decreased upon IFI16 depletion in vivo. Furthermore, IFI16 expression correlates with improved clinical outcome in patients with TNBC treated with chemotherapy. Together, our findings suggest that type-I IFNs and IFI16 could offer potential therapeutic strategies for TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-fate conversion generally requires reprogramming effectors to both introduce fate programs of the target cell type and erase the identity of starting cell population. Here, we reveal insights into the activity of microRNAs miR-9/9∗ and miR-124 (miR-9/9∗-124) as reprogramming agents that orchestrate direct conversion of human fibroblasts into motor neurons by first eradicating fibroblast identity and promoting uniform transition to a neuronal state in sequence. We identify KLF-family transcription factors as direct target genes for miR-9/9∗-124 and show their repression is critical for erasing fibroblast fate. Subsequent gain of neuronal identity requires upregulation of a small nuclear RNA, RN7SK, which induces accessibilities of chromatin regions and neuronal gene activation to push cells to a neuronal state. Our study defines deterministic components in the microRNA-mediated reprogramming cascade.

Abstract: Summary
Accelerated glycolysis is the main metabolic change observed in cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and their role in cancer progression remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the deletion of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Neat1 in MMTV-PyVT mice profoundly impairs tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis, specifically switching off the penultimate step of glycolysis. Mechanistically, NEAT1 directly binds and forms a scaffold bridge for the assembly of PGK1/PGAM1/ENO1 complexes and thereby promotes substrate channeling for high and efficient glycolysis. Notably, NEAT1 is upregulated in cancer patients and correlates with high levels of these complexes, and genetic and pharmacological blockade of penultimate glycolysis ablates NEAT1-dependent tumorigenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that Pinin mediates glucose-stimulated nuclear export of NEAT1, through which it exerts isoform-specific and paraspeckle-independent functions. These findings establish a direct role for NEAT1 in regulating tumor metabolism, provide new insights into the Warburg effect, and identify potential targets for therapy.

Abstract: Summary
How abnormal visual experiences early in life influence human subcortical pathways is poorly understood. Using high-resolution fMRI and pathway-selective visual stimuli, we investigate the influence of amblyopia on response properties and the effective connectivity of subcortical visual pathways of the adult human brain. Compared to the normal and fellow eyes, stimuli presented to the amblyopic eye show selectively reduced response in the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus and weaker effective connectivity to V1. Compared to the normal eye, the response of the amblyopic eye to chromatic stimulus decreases in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus, while response of the fellow eye robustly increases in the deep SC with stronger connectivity from the visual cortex. Therefore, amblyopia leads to selective parvocellular alterations of the geniculostriate and corticotectal pathways. These findings provide the neural basis for amblyopic deficits in visual acuity, ocular motor control, and attention.

Abstract: Summary
P21-activated kinase 5 (PAK5) plays an important role in tumors. However, the functional role of PAK5 in mammary tumorigenesis in vivo remains unclear. Here, we show that PAK5 deficiency represses MMTV-PyVT-driven breast tumorigenesis. DEAD-box RNA helicase 5 (DDX5) is a substrate of PAK5, which is phosphorylated on threonine 69. PAK5-mediated DDX5 phosphorylation promotes breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. The increased expression levels of PAK5 and phospho-DDX5 threonine 69 are associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcomes of patients. PAK5 facilitates the phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation of DDX5 to stabilize DDX5. Both the phosphorylation and sumoylation of DDX5 enhance the formation of a DDX5/Drosha/DGCR8 complex, thus promoting microRNA-10b processing. Finally, we verify decreased expression of DDX5 phosphorylation and sumoylation and mature miR-10b in PAK5−/−/MMTV-PyVT transgenic mice. Our findings provide insights into the function of PAK5 in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, which might be a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin (K63-Ub) chains activate a range of cellular immune and inflammatory signaling pathways, including the mammalian antiviral response. Interferon and antiviral genes are triggered by TRAF family ubiquitin ligases that form K63-Ub chains. LGP2 is a feedback inhibitor of TRAF-mediated K63-Ub that can interfere with diverse immune signaling pathways. Our results demonstrate that LGP2 inhibits K63-Ub by association with and sequestration of the K63-Ub-conjugating enzyme, Ubc13/UBE2N. The LGP2 helicase subdomain, Hel2i, mediates protein interaction that engages and inhibits Ubc13/UBE2N, affecting control over a range of K63-Ub ligase proteins, including TRAF6, TRIM25, and RNF125, all of which are inactivated by LGP2. These findings establish a unifying mechanism for LGP2-mediated negative regulation that can modulate a variety of K63-Ub signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
It is well established in the microbiome field that antibiotic (ATB) use and metabolic disease both impact the structure and function of the gut microbiome. But how host and microbial metabolism interacts with ATB susceptibility to affect the resulting dysbiosis remains poorly understood. In a streptozotocin-induced model of hyperglycemia (HG), we use a combined metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic approach to profile changes in microbiome taxonomic composition, transcriptional activity, and metabolite abundance both pre- and post-ATB challenge. We find that HG impacts both microbiome structure and metabolism, ultimately increasing susceptibility to amoxicillin. HG exacerbates drug-induced dysbiosis and increases both phosphotransferase system activity and energy catabolism compared to controls. Finally, HG and ATB co-treatment increases pathogen susceptibility and reduces survival in a Salmonella enterica infection model. Our data demonstrate that induced HG is sufficient to modify the cecal metabolite pool, worsen the severity of ATB dysbiosis, and decrease colonization resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The ATPase Family AAA Domain Containing 3A (ATAD3A), is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein conserved in metazoans. ATAD3A has been associated with several mitochondrial functions, including nucleoid organization, cholesterol metabolism, and mitochondrial translation. To address its primary role, we generated a neuronal-specific conditional knockout (Atad3 nKO) mouse model, which developed a severe encephalopathy by 5 months of age. Pre-symptomatic mice showed aberrant mitochondrial cristae morphogenesis in the cortex as early as 2 months. Using a multi-omics approach in the CNS of 2-to-3-month-old mice, we found early alterations in the organelle membrane structure. We also show that human ATAD3A associates with different components of the inner membrane, including OXPHOS complex I, Letm1, and prohibitin complexes. Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) shows that ATAD3A is regularly distributed along the inner mitochondrial membrane, suggesting a critical structural role in inner mitochondrial membrane and its organization, most likely in an ATPase-dependent manner.

Abstract: Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based high-throughput sequencing (Hi-C) has enabled identification of genome-wide chromatin loops. Because the Hi-C map with restriction fragment resolution is intrinsically associated with sparsity and stochastic noise, Hi-C data are usually binned at particular intervals; however, the binning method has limited reliability, especially at high resolution. Here, we describe a new method called HiCORE, which provides simple pipelines and algorithms to overcome the limitations of single-layered binning and predict core chromatin regions with three-dimensional physical interactions. In this approach, multiple layers of binning with slightly shifted genome coverage are generated, and interacting bins at each layer are integrated to infer narrower regions of chromatin interactions. HiCORE predicts chromatin looping regions with higher resolution, both in human and Arabidopsis genomes, and contributes to the identification of the precise positions of potential genomic elements in an unbiased manner.

Abstract: Summary
Myoblast fusion is essential for muscle development and regeneration. Yet, it remains poorly understood how mononucleated myoblasts fuse with preexisting fibers. We demonstrate that ERK1/2 inhibition (ERKi) induces robust differentiation and fusion of primary mouse myoblasts through a linear pathway involving RXR, ryanodine receptors, and calcium-dependent activation of CaMKII in nascent myotubes. CaMKII activation results in myotube growth via fusion with mononucleated myoblasts at a fusogenic synapse. Mechanistically, CaMKII interacts with and regulates MYMK and Rac1, and CaMKIIδ/γ knockout mice exhibit smaller regenerated myofibers following injury. In addition, the expression of a dominant negative CaMKII inhibits the formation of large multinucleated myotubes. Finally, we demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of the pathway in chicken myoblasts. We conclude that ERK1/2 represses a signaling cascade leading to CaMKII-mediated fusion of myoblasts to myotubes, providing an attractive target for the cultivated meat industry and regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental factors may regulate the expression of immune modulatory proteins in cancer, linking embryonic development and cancer cell immune evasion. This is particularly relevant in melanoma because immune checkpoint inhibitors are commonly used in the clinic. SRY-box transcription factor 10 (SOX10) mediates neural crest development and is required for melanoma cell growth. In this study, we investigate immune-related targets of SOX10 and observe positive regulation of herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) and carcinoembryonic-antigen cell-adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). Sox10 knockout reduces tumor growth in vivo, and this effect is exacerbated in immune-competent models. Modulation of CEACAM1 expression but not HVEM elicits modest effects on tumor growth. Importantly, Sox10 knockout effects on tumor growth are dependent, in part, on CD8+ T cells. Extending this analysis to samples from patients with cutaneous melanoma, we observe a negative correlation with SOX10 and immune-related pathways. These data demonstrate a role for SOX10 in regulating immune checkpoint protein expression and anti-tumor immunity in melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms have evolved that allow cells to detect signals and generate an appropriate response. The accuracy of these responses relies on the ability of cells to discriminate between signal and noise. How cells filter noise in signaling pathways is not well understood. Here, we analyze noise suppression in the yeast pheromone signaling pathway and show that the poorly characterized protein Kel1 serves as a major noise suppressor and prevents cell death. At the molecular level, Kel1 prevents spontaneous activation of the pheromone response by inhibiting membrane recruitment of Ste5 and Far1. Only a hypophosphorylated form of Kel1 suppresses signaling, reduces noise, and prevents pheromone-associated cell death, and our data indicate that the MAPK Fus3 contributes to Kel1 phosphorylation. Taken together, Kel1 serves as a phospho-regulated suppressor of the pheromone pathway to reduce noise, inhibit spontaneous activation of the pathway, regulate mating efficiency, and prevent pheromone-associated cell death.

Abstract: Summary
The derivation of tissue-specific stem cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) would have broad reaching implications for regenerative medicine. Here, we report the directed differentiation of human iPSCs into airway basal cells (“iBCs”), a population resembling the stem cell of the airway epithelium. Using a dual fluorescent reporter system (NKX2-1GFP;TP63tdTomato), we track and purify these cells as they first emerge as developmentally immature NKX2-1GFP+ lung progenitors and subsequently augment a TP63 program during proximal airway epithelial patterning. In response to primary basal cell medium, NKX2-1GFP+/TP63tdTomato+ cells display the molecular and functional phenotype of airway basal cells, including the capacity to self-renew or undergo multi-lineage differentiation in vitro and in tracheal xenografts in vivo. iBCs and their differentiated progeny model perturbations that characterize acquired and genetic airway diseases, including the mucus metaplasia of asthma, chloride channel dysfunction of cystic fibrosis, and ciliary defects of primary ciliary dyskinesia.

Abstract: Summary
Lipogenesis plays a critical role in colorectal carcinogenesis, but precisely how remains unclear. Here, we show that ERK2 phosphorylates ME1 at T103, thereby inhibiting its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and enhancing its interaction with USP19. USP19 antagonizes RNF1-mediated ME1 degradation by deubiquitination, which in turn promotes lipid metabolism and NADPH production and suppresses ROS. Meanwhile, ROS dramatically increases PD-L1 mRNA levels through accelerating expression of the transcription factor NRF2. Increased lipid metabolism is correlated with ERK2 activity and colorectal carcinogenesis in human patients. Therefore, the combination of ERK2 inhibitor and anti-PD-L1 antibody significantly inhibits spontaneous and chemically induced colorectal carcinogenesis. Collectively, the USP19-ME1 axis plays a vital role in colorectal carcinogenesis and may also provide a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Previous studies have shown that the high mortality caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus primarily results from complications of a cytokine storm. Therefore, it is critical to identify the key factors participating in the cytokine storm. Here we demonstrate that interferon-induced protein 35 (IFP35) plays an important role in the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection. We find that the levels of serum IFP35 in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 correlates with severity of the syndrome. Using mouse model and cell assays, we show that IFP35 is released by lung epithelial cells and macrophages after SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus infection. In addition, we show that administration of neutralizing antibodies against IFP35 considerably reduces lung injury and, thus, the mortality rate of mice exposed to viral infection. Our findings suggest that IFP35 serves as a biomarker and as a therapeutic target in virus-induced syndromes.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 infection causes more severe disease in pregnant women compared to age-matched non-pregnant women. Whether maternal infection causes changes in the transfer of immunity to infants remains unclear. Maternal infections have previously been associated with compromised placental antibody transfer, but the mechanism underlying this compromised transfer is not established. Here, we used systems serology to characterize the Fc profile of influenza-, pertussis-, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies transferred across the placenta. Influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies were actively transferred. However, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody transfer was significantly reduced compared to influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies, and cord titers and functional activity were lower than in maternal plasma. This effect was only observed in third-trimester infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific transfer was linked to altered SARS-CoV-2-antibody glycosylation profiles and was partially rescued by infection-induced increases in IgG and increased FCGR3A placental expression. These results point to unexpected compensatory mechanisms to boost immunity in neonates, providing insights for maternal vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
Aggression involves both sexually monomorphic and dimorphic actions. How the brain implements these two types of actions is poorly understood. We have identified three cell types that regulate aggression in Drosophila: one type is sexually shared, and the other two are sex specific. Shared common aggression-promoting (CAP) neurons mediate aggressive approach in both sexes, whereas functionally downstream dimorphic but homologous cell types, called male-specific aggression-promoting (MAP) neurons in males and fpC1 in females, control dimorphic attack. These symmetric circuits underlie the divergence of male and female aggressive behaviors, from their monomorphic appetitive/motivational to their dimorphic consummatory phases. The strength of the monomorphic → dimorphic functional connection is increased by social isolation in both sexes, suggesting that it may be a locus for isolation-dependent enhancement of aggression. Together, these findings reveal a circuit logic for the neural control of behaviors that include both sexually monomorphic and dimorphic actions, which may generalize to other organisms.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiated somatic cells can be reprogrammed to totipotent embryos through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) with low efficiency. The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) has been found to improve SCNT efficiency, but the underlying mechanism remains undetermined. Here, we examined genome-wide H3K9ac during SCNT embryo development and found that aberrant H3K9ac regions resulted in reduced 2-cell genome activation. TSA treatment largely corrects aberrant acetylation in SCNT embryos with an efficiency that is dictated by the native epigenetic environment. We further identified that the overexpression of Dux greatly improves SCNT efficiency by correcting the aberrant H3K9ac signal at its target sites, ensuring appropriate 2-cell genome activation. Intriguingly, the improvement in development mediated by TSA and Kdm4b is impeded by Dux knockout in SCNT embryos. Together, our study reveals that reprogramming of H3K9ac is important for optimal SCNT efficiency and identifies Dux as a crucial transcription factor in this process.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2-induced hypercytokinemia and inflammation are critically associated with COVID-19 severity. Baricitinib, a clinically approved JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is currently being investigated in COVID-19 clinical trials. Here, we investigated the immunologic and virologic efficacy of baricitinib in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral shedding measured from nasal and throat swabs, bronchoalveolar lavages, and tissues was not reduced with baricitinib. Type I interferon (IFN) antiviral responses and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses remained similar between the two groups. Animals treated with baricitinib showed reduced inflammation, decreased lung infiltration of inflammatory cells, reduced NETosis activity, and more limited lung pathology. Importantly, baricitinib-treated animals had a rapid and remarkably potent suppression of lung macrophage production of cytokines and chemokines responsible for inflammation and neutrophil recruitment. These data support a beneficial role for, and elucidate the immunological mechanisms underlying, the use of baricitinib as a frontline treatment for inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: BLT2 is a low-affinity receptor for leukotriene B4, a potent lipid mediator of inflammation generated from arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate whether BLT2 plays any role in sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by infection. A murine model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis was used to evaluate the role of BLT2 in septic inflammation. In the present study, we observed that the levels of ligands for BLT2 (LTB4 [leukotriene B4] and 12(S)-HETE [12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]) were significantly increased in the peritoneal lavage fluid and serum from mice with CLP-induced sepsis. We also observed that the levels of BLT2 as well as 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and 12-LO, which are synthesizing enzymes for LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE, were significantly increased in lung and liver tissues in the CLP mouse model. Blockade of BLT2 markedly suppressed the production of sepsis-associated cytokines (IL-6 [interleukin-6], TNF-α[[tumor necrosis factor alpha], and IL-1β [interleukin-1β] as well as IL-17 [interleukin-17]) and alleviated lung inflammation in the CLP group. Taken together, our results suggest that BLT2 cascade contributes to lung inflammation in CLP-induced sepsis by mediating the production of inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that BLT2 may be a potential therapeutic target for sepsis patients.

Abstract: Summary
To better understand host-virus genetic dependencies and find potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR loss-of-function screen to identify host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection of human alveolar epithelial cells. Top-ranked genes cluster into distinct pathways, including the vacuolar ATPase proton pump, Retromer, and Commander complexes. We validate these gene targets using several orthogonal methods such as CRISPR knockout, RNA interference knockdown, and small-molecule inhibitors. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identify shared transcriptional changes in cholesterol biosynthesis upon loss of top-ranked genes. In addition, given the key role of the ACE2 receptor in the early stages of viral entry, we show that loss of RAB7A reduces viral entry by sequestering the ACE2 receptor inside cells. Overall, this work provides a genome-scale, quantitative resource of the impact of the loss of each host gene on fitness/response to viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
Glycolytic reprogramming is a typical feature of cancer. However, the cancer-specific modulation of glycolytic enzymes requires systematic elucidation. Here, we report a range of dysregulated modifications in association with a family of enzymes specifically related to the glycolysis pathway by systematic identification of delta masses at the proteomic scale in human non-small-cell lung cancer. The most significant modification is the delta mass of 79.967 Da at serine 58 (Ser58) of triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), which is confirmed to be phosphorylation. Blocking TPI Ser58 phosphorylation dramatically inhibits glycolysis, cancer growth, and metastasis. The protein kinase PRKACA directly phosphorylates TPI Ser58, thereby enhancing TPI enzymatic activity and glycolysis. The upregulation of TPI Ser58 phosphorylation is detected in various human tumor specimens and correlates with poor survival. Therefore, our study identifies a number of cancer-specific protein modifications spanned on glycolytic enzymes and unravels the significance of TPI Ser58 phosphorylation in glycolysis and lung cancer development.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence that the brain combines different value learning strategies to minimize prediction error is accumulating. However, the tradeoff between bias and variance error, which imposes different constraints on each learning strategy's performance, poses a challenge for value learning. While this tradeoff specifies the requirements for optimal learning, little has been known about how the brain deals with this issue. Here, we hypothesize that the brain adaptively resolves the bias-variance tradeoff during reinforcement learning. Our theory suggests that the solution necessitates baseline correction for prediction error, which offsets the adverse effects of irreducible error on value learning. We show behavioral evidence of adaptive control using a Markov decision task with context changes. The prediction error baseline seemingly signals context changes to improve adaptability. Critically, we identify multiplexed representations of prediction error baseline within the ventrolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, key brain regions known to guide model-based and model-free reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Summary
Germ cells have evolved unique mechanisms to ensure the transmission of genetically and nongenetically encoded information, whose alteration compromises germ cell immortality. Chromatin factors play fundamental roles in these mechanisms. H3K36 and H3K27 methyltransferases shape and propagate a pattern of histone methylation essential for C. elegans germ cell maintenance, but the role of respective histone demethylases remains unexplored. Here, we show that jmjd-5 regulates H3K36me2 and H3K27me3 levels, preserves germline immortality, and protects germ cell identity by controlling gene expression. The transcriptional and biological effects of jmjd-5 loss can be hindered by the removal of H3K27demethylases, indicating that H3K36/K27 demethylases act in a transcriptional framework and promote the balance between H3K36 and H3K27 methylation required for germ cell immortality. Furthermore, we find that in wild-type, but not in jmjd-5 mutants, alterations of H3K36 methylation and transcription occur at high temperature, suggesting a role for jmjd-5 in adaptation to environmental changes.

Abstract: Summary
Deleterious genetic variants in POGZ, which encodes the chromatin regulator Pogo Transposable Element with ZNF Domain protein, are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although it is a high-confidence ASD risk gene, the neurodevelopmental functions of POGZ remain unclear. Here we reveal the genomic binding of POGZ in the developing forebrain at euchromatic loci and gene regulatory elements (REs). We profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in Pogz−/− mice and show that POGZ promotes the active chromatin state and transcription of clustered synaptic genes. We further demonstrate that POGZ forms a nuclear complex and co-occupies loci with ADNP, another high-confidence ASD risk gene, and provide evidence that POGZ regulates other neurodevelopmental disorder risk genes as well. Our results reveal a neurodevelopmental function of an ASD risk gene and identify molecular targets that may elucidate its function in ASD.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has high relapse and low 5-year survival rates. Single-cell profiling in relapsed HCC may aid in the design of effective anticancer therapies, including immunotherapies. We profiled the transcriptomes of ∼17,000 cells from 18 primary or early-relapse HCC cases. Early-relapse tumors have reduced levels of regulatory T cells, increased dendritic cells (DCs), and increased infiltrated CD8+ T cells, compared with primary tumors, in two independent cohorts. Remarkably, CD8+ T cells in recurrent tumors overexpressed KLRB1 (CD161) and displayed an innate-like low cytotoxic state, with low clonal expansion, unlike the classical exhausted state observed in primary HCC. The enrichment of these cells was associated with a worse prognosis. Differential gene expression and interaction analyses revealed potential immune evasion mechanisms in recurrent tumor cells that dampen DC antigen presentation and recruit innate-like CD8+ T cells. Our comprehensive picture of the HCC ecosystem provides deeper insights into immune evasion mechanisms associated with tumor relapse.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular calcium signaling underlies the astroglial control of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts (MERCs) are key determinants of calcium dynamics, but their functional impact on astroglial regulation of brain information processing is unexplored. We found that the activation of astrocyte mitochondrial-associated type-1 cannabinoid (mtCB1) receptors determines MERC-dependent intracellular calcium signaling and synaptic integration. The stimulation of mtCB1 receptors promotes calcium transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria through a specific molecular cascade, involving the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). Physiologically, mtCB1-dependent mitochondrial calcium uptake determines the dynamics of cytosolic calcium events in astrocytes upon endocannabinoid mobilization. Accordingly, electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices showed that conditional genetic exclusion of mtCB1 receptors or dominant-negative MCU expression in astrocytes blocks lateral synaptic potentiation, through which astrocytes integrate the activity of distant synapses. Altogether, these data reveal an endocannabinoid link between astroglial MERCs and the regulation of brain network functions.

Abstract: Summary
Plants tailor immune responses to defend against pathogens with different lifestyles. In this process, antagonism between the immune hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) optimizes transcriptional signatures specifically to the attacker encountered. Antagonism is controlled by the transcription cofactor NPR1. The indispensable role of NPR1 in activating SA-responsive genes is well understood, but how it functions as a repressor of JA-responsive genes remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that SA-induced NPR1 is recruited to JA-responsive promoter regions that are co-occupied by a JA-induced transcription complex consisting of the MYC2 activator and MED25 Mediator subunit. In the presence of SA, NPR1 physically associates with JA-induced MYC2 and inhibits transcriptional activation by disrupting its interaction with MED25. Importantly, NPR1-mediated inhibition of MYC2 is a major immune mechanism for suppressing pathogen virulence. Thus, NPR1 orchestrates the immune transcriptome not only by activating SA-responsive genes but also by acting as a corepressor of JA-responsive MYC2.

Abstract: Summary
Blockade of the inhibitory checkpoint SIRPα-CD47 promotes phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages and is a promising avenue in anti-cancer therapy. Productive phagocytosis is strictly predicated on co-engagement of pro-phagocytic receptors—namely, Fc receptors (FcRs), integrin CD11b, or SLAMF7—by their ligands on cancer cells. Here, we examine whether additional pro-phagocytic receptors could be harnessed to broaden the scope of phagocytosis. Inflammatory stimuli, including multiple cytokines and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, augment phagocytosis efficiency and fully alleviate the requirement of FcRs, CD11b, and SLAMF7 for phagocytosis. These effects are mediated by the unconventional pro-phagocytic integrins CD11a and CD11c, which act with CD18 to initiate actin polarization, leading to phagocytosis. Some inflammatory stimuli enable phagocytosis even in the absence of SIRPα-CD47 blockade. Higher CD11c expression in macrophage-enriched tumors correlates with improved survival in clinical studies. Thus, inflammatory macrophages exploit unconventional pro-phagocytic integrins for improved phagocytosis and anti-tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The Coronaviridae are a family of viruses that cause disease in humans ranging from mild respiratory infection to potentially lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome. Finding host factors common to multiple coronaviruses could facilitate the development of therapies to combat current and future coronavirus pandemics. Here, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR screens in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 as well as two seasonally circulating common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and 229E. This approach correctly identified the distinct viral entry factors ACE2 (for SARS-CoV-2), aminopeptidase N (for 229E), and glycosaminoglycans (for OC43). Additionally, we identified phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis as critical host pathways supporting infection by all three coronaviruses. By contrast, the lysosomal protein TMEM106B appeared unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol kinases and cholesterol homeostasis reduced replication of all three coronaviruses. These findings offer important insights for the understanding of the coronavirus life cycle and the development of host-directed therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding proteins 1 and 2 (G3BP1 and G3BP2, respectively) are widely recognized as core components of stress granules (SGs). We report that G3BPs reside at the cytoplasmic surface of lysosomes. They act in a non-redundant manner to anchor the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein complex to lysosomes and suppress activation of the metabolic master regulator mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by amino acids and insulin. Like the TSC complex, G3BP1 deficiency elicits phenotypes related to mTORC1 hyperactivity. In the context of tumors, low G3BP1 levels enhance mTORC1-driven breast cancer cell motility and correlate with adverse outcomes in patients. Furthermore, G3bp1 inhibition in zebrafish disturbs neuronal development and function, leading to white matter heterotopia and neuronal hyperactivity. Thus, G3BPs are not only core components of SGs but also a key element of lysosomal TSC-mTORC1 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Lifelong blood production requires long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs), marked by stemness states involving quiescence and self-renewal, to transition into activated short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs) with reduced stemness. As few transcriptional changes underlie this transition, we used single-cell and bulk assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) on human HSCs and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) subsets to uncover chromatin accessibility signatures, one including LT-HSCs (LT/HSPC signature) and another excluding LT-HSCs (activated HSPC [Act/HSPC] signature). These signatures inversely correlated during early hematopoietic commitment and differentiation. The Act/HSPC signature contains CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites mediating 351 chromatin interactions engaged in ST-HSCs, but not LT-HSCs, enclosing multiple stemness pathway genes active in LT-HSCs and repressed in ST-HSCs. CTCF silencing derepressed stemness genes, restraining quiescent LT-HSCs from transitioning to activated ST-HSCs. Hence, 3D chromatin interactions centrally mediated by CTCF endow a gatekeeper function that governs the earliest fate transitions HSCs make by coordinating disparate stemness pathways linked to quiescence and self-renewal.

Abstract: Summary
The lipid raft-resident protein, MAL2, has been implicated as contributing to the pathogenesis of several malignancies, including breast cancer, but the underlying mechanism for its effects on tumorigenesis is unknown. Here, we show that MAL2-mediated lipid raft formation leads to HER2 plasma membrane retention and enhanced HER2 signaling in breast cancer cells. We demonstrate physical interactions between HER2 and MAL2 in lipid rafts using proximity ligation assays. Super-resolution structured illumination microscopy imaging displays the structural organization of the HER2/Ezrin/NHERF1/PMCA2 protein complex. Formation of this protein complex maintains low intracellular calcium concentrations in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. HER2/MAL2 protein interactions in lipid rafts are enhanced in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. Our findings suggest that MAL2 is crucial for lipid raft formation, HER2 signaling, and HER2 membrane stability in breast cancer cells, suggesting MAL2 as a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Although cell transplantation can rescue motor defects in Parkinson’s disease (PD) models, whether and how grafts functionally repair damaged neural circuitry in the adult brain is not known. We transplanted hESC-derived midbrain dopamine (mDA) or cortical glutamate neurons into the substantia nigra or striatum of a mouse PD model and found extensive graft integration with host circuitry. Axonal pathfinding toward the dorsal striatum was determined by the identity of the grafted neurons, and anatomical presynaptic inputs were largely dependent on graft location, whereas inhibitory versus excitatory input was dictated by the identity of grafted neurons. hESC-derived mDA neurons display A9 characteristics and restore functionality of the reconstructed nigrostriatal circuit to mediate improvements in motor function. These results indicate similarity in cell-type-specific pre- and post-synaptic integration between transplant-reconstructed circuit and endogenous neural networks, highlighting the capacity of hPSC-derived neuron subtypes for specific circuit repair and functional restoration in the adult brain.

Abstract: Summary
Enormous amounts of essential intracellular events are crowdedly packed inside picoliter-sized cellular space. However, the significance of the physical properties of cells remains underappreciated because of a lack of evidence of how they affect cellular functionalities. Here, we show that volumetric compression regulates the growth of intestinal organoids by modifying intracellular crowding and elevating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Intracellular crowding varies upon stimulation by different types of extracellular physical/mechanical cues and leads to significant enhancement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by stabilizing the LRP6 signalosome. By enhancing intracellular crowding using osmotic and mechanical compression, we show that expansion of intestinal organoids was facilitated through elevated Wnt/β-catenin signaling and greater intestinal stem cell (ISC) self-renewal. Our results provide an entry point for understanding how intracellular crowdedness functions as a physical regulator linking extracellular physical cues with intracellular signaling and potentially facilitate the design of engineering approaches for expansion of stem cells and organoids.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal CaMKII holoenzymes (α and β isoforms) enable molecular signal computation underlying learning and memory but also mediate excitotoxic neuronal death. Here, we provide a comparative analysis of these signaling devices, using single-particle electron microscopy (EM) in combination with biochemical and live-cell imaging studies. In the basal state, both isoforms assemble mainly as 12-mers (but also 14-mers and even 16-mers for the β isoform). CaMKIIα and β isoforms adopt an ensemble of extended activatable states (with average radius of 12.6 versus 16.8 nm, respectively), characterized by multiple transient intra- and inter-holoenzyme interactions associated with distinct functional properties. The extended state of CaMKIIβ allows direct resolution of intra-holoenzyme kinase domain dimers. These dimers could enable cooperative activation by calmodulin, which is observed for both isoforms. High-order CaMKII clustering mediated by inter-holoenzyme kinase domain dimerization is reduced for the β isoform for both basal and excitotoxicity-induced clusters, both in vitro and in neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA requires sequential reactions facilitated by the replication and transcription complex (RTC). Here, we present a structural snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 RTC as it transitions toward cap structure synthesis. We determine the atomic cryo-EM structure of an extended RTC assembled by nsp7-nsp82-nsp12-nsp132-RNA and a single RNA-binding protein, nsp9. Nsp9 binds tightly to nsp12 (RdRp) NiRAN, allowing nsp9 N terminus inserting into the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN, which then inhibits activity. We also show that nsp12 NiRAN possesses guanylyltransferase activity, catalyzing the formation of cap core structure (GpppA). The orientation of nsp13 that anchors the 5′ extension of template RNA shows a remarkable conformational shift, resulting in zinc finger 3 of its ZBD inserting into a minor groove of paired template-primer RNA. These results reason an intermediate state of RTC toward mRNA synthesis, pave a way to understand the RTC architecture, and provide a target for antiviral development.

Abstract: Summary
Passive antibody therapy and vectored antibody gene delivery (VAGD) in particular offer an innovative approach to combat persistent viral diseases. Here, we exploit a small animal model to investigate synergies of VAGD with the host’s endogenous immune defense for treating chronic viral infection. An adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector delivering the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-neutralizing antibody KL25 (AAV-KL25) establishes protective antibody titers for >200 days. When therapeutically administered to chronically infected immunocompetent wild-type mice, AAV-KL25 affords sustained viral load control. In contrast, viral mutational escape thwarts therapeutic AAV-KL25 effects when mice are unable to mount LCMV-specific antibody responses or lack CD8+ T cells. VAGD augments antiviral germinal center B cell and antibody-secreting cell responses and reduces inhibitory receptor expression on antiviral CD8+ T cells. These results indicate that VAGD fortifies host immune defense and synergizes with B cell and CD8 T cell responses to restore immune control of chronic viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
The prostate gland produces prostatic fluid, high in zinc and citrate and essential for the maintenance of spermatozoa. Prostate cancer is a common condition with limited treatment efficacy in castration-resistant metastatic disease, including with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing to perform an unbiased assessment of the cellular landscape of human prostate, we identify a subset of tumor-enriched androgen receptor-negative luminal epithelial cells with increased expression of cancer-associated genes. We also find a variety of innate and adaptive immune cells in normal prostate that were transcriptionally perturbed in prostate cancer. An exception is a prostate-specific, zinc transporter-expressing macrophage population (MAC-MT) that contributes to tissue zinc accumulation in homeostasis but shows enhanced inflammatory gene expression in tumors, including T cell-recruiting chemokines. Remarkably, enrichment of the MAC-MT signature in cancer biopsies is associated with improved disease-free survival, suggesting beneficial antitumor functions.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms driving the prolonged meiotic prophase I in mammals are poorly understood. RNA helicase YTHDC2 is critical for mitosis to meiosis transition. However, YTHDC2 is highly expressed in pachytene cells. Here we identify an essential role for YTHDC2 in meiotic progression. Specifically, YTHDC2 deficiency causes microtubule-dependent telomere clustering and apoptosis at the pachytene stage of prophase I. Depletion of YTHDC2 results in a massively dysregulated transcriptome in pachytene cells, with a tendency toward upregulation of genes normally expressed in mitotic germ cells and downregulation of meiotic transcripts. Dysregulation does not correlate with m6A status, and YTHDC2-bound mRNAs are enriched in genes upregulated in mutant germ cells, revealing that YTHDC2 primarily targets mRNAs for degradation. Furthermore, altered transcripts in mutant pachytene cells encode microtubule network proteins. Our results demonstrate that YTHDC2 regulates the pachytene stage by perpetuating a meiotic transcriptome and preventing microtubule network changes that could lead to telomere clustering.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain transit from the quiescent state to proliferation to produce new neurons. The mechanisms regulating this transition in freely behaving animals are, however, poorly understood. We customized in vivo imaging protocols to follow NSCs for several days up to months, observing their activation kinetics in freely behaving mice. Strikingly, NSC division is more frequent during daylight and is inhibited by darkness-induced melatonin signaling. The inhibition of melatonin receptors affected intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and promoted NSC activation. We further discovered a Ca2+ signature of quiescent versus activated NSCs and showed that several microenvironmental signals converge on intracellular Ca2+ pathways to regulate NSC quiescence and activation. In vivo NSC-specific optogenetic modulation of Ca2+ fluxes to mimic quiescent-state-like Ca2+ dynamics in freely behaving mice blocked NSC activation and maintained their quiescence, pointing to the regulatory mechanisms mediating NSC activation in freely behaving animals.

Abstract: Summary
Flaviviruses pose a constant threat to human health. These RNA viruses are transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes and ticks and regularly cause outbreaks. To identify host factors required for flavivirus infection, we performed full-genome loss of function CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Based on these results, we focused our efforts on characterizing the roles that TMEM41B and VMP1 play in the virus replication cycle. Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B revealed that all members of the Flaviviridae family that we tested require TMEM41B. We tested 12 additional virus families and found that SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronaviridae also required TMEM41B for infection. Remarkably, single nucleotide polymorphisms present at nearly 20% in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection.

Abstract: Summary
Despite our growing understanding of embryonic immune development, rare early megakaryocytes (MKs) remain relatively understudied. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing of human MKs from embryonic yolk sac (YS) and fetal liver (FL) to characterize the transcriptome, cellular heterogeneity, and developmental trajectories of early megakaryopoiesis. In the YS and FL, we found heterogeneous MK subpopulations with distinct developmental routes and patterns of gene expression that could reflect early functional specialization. Intriguingly, we identified a subpopulation of CD42b+CD14+ MKs in vivo that exhibit high expression of genes associated with immune responses and can also be derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in vitro. Furthermore, we identified THBS1 as an early marker for MK-biased embryonic endothelial cells. Overall, we provide important insights and invaluable resources for dissection of the molecular and cellular programs underlying early human megakaryopoiesis.

Abstract: The virus-induced genome editing (VIGE) system aims to induce targeted mutations in seeds without requiring any tissue culture. Here, we show that tobacco rattle virus (TRV) harboring guide RNA (gRNA) edits germ cells in a wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, that expresses Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). We first generated N. attenuata transgenic plants expressing SpCas9 under the control of 35S promoter and infected rosette leaves with TRV carrying gRNA. Gene-edited seeds were not found in the progeny of the infected N. attenuata. Next, the N. attenuata ribosomal protein S5 A (RPS5A) promoter fused to SpCas9 was employed to induce the heritable gene editing with TRV. The RPS5A promoter-driven SpCas9 successfully produced monoallelic mutations at three target genes in N. attenuata seeds with TRV-delivered guide RNA. These monoallelic mutations were found in 2%-6% seeds among M1 progenies. This editing method provides an alternative way to increase the heritable editing efficacy of VIGE.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of host genes essential for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may reveal novel therapeutic targets and inform our understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis. Here we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens in Vero-E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), bat CoV HKU5 expressing the SARS-CoV-1 spike, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike. We identified known SARS-CoV-2 host factors, including the receptor ACE2 and protease Cathepsin L. We additionally discovered pro-viral genes and pathways, including HMGB1 and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, that are SARS lineage and pan-coronavirus specific, respectively. We show that HMGB1 regulates ACE2 expression and is critical for entry of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and NL63. We also show that small-molecule antagonists of identified gene products inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in monkey and human cells, demonstrating the conserved role of these genetic hits across species. This identifies potential therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and reveals SARS lineage-specific and pan-CoV host factors that regulate susceptibility to highly pathogenic CoVs.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages are often prominently present in the tumor microenvironment, where distinct macrophage populations can differentially affect tumor progression. Although metabolism influences macrophage function, studies on the metabolic characteristics of ex vivo tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subsets are rather limited. Using transcriptomic and metabolic analyses, we now reveal that pro-inflammatory major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-IIhi TAMs display a hampered tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, while reparative MHC-IIlo TAMs show higher oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. Although both TAM subsets rapidly exchange lactate in high-lactate conditions, only MHC-IIlo TAMs use lactate as an additional carbon source. Accordingly, lactate supports the oxidative metabolism in MHC-IIlo TAMs, while it decreases the metabolic activity of MHC-IIhi TAMs. Lactate subtly affects the transcriptome of MHC-IIlo TAMs, increases L-arginine metabolism, and enhances the T cell suppressive capacity of these TAMs. Overall, our data uncover the metabolic intricacies of distinct TAM subsets and identify lactate as a carbon source and metabolic and functional regulator of TAMs.

Abstract: SUMMARY
Biological processes are regulated by intermolecular interactions and chemical modifications that do not affect protein levels, thus escaping detection in classical proteomic screens. We demonstrate here that a global protein structural readout based on limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) detects many such functional alterations, simultaneously and in situ, in bacteria undergoing nutrient adaptation and in yeast responding to acute stress. The structural readout, visualized as structural barcodes, captured enzyme activity changes, phosphorylation, protein aggregation, and complex formation, with the resolution of individual regulated functional sites such as binding and active sites. Comparison with prior knowledge, including other ‘omics data, showed that LiP-MS detects many known functional alterations within well-studied pathways. It suggested distinct metabolite-protein interactions and enabled identification of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphate-based regulatory mechanism of glucose uptake in E. coli. The structural readout dramatically increases classical proteomics coverage, generates mechanistic hypotheses, and paves the way for in situ structural systems biology.

Abstract: Summary
Whether or how the pathogenic disruptions in endosomal trafficking observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are linked to its anatomical vulnerability remain unknown. Here, we began addressing these questions by showing that neurons are enriched with a second retromer core, organized around VPS26b, differentially dedicated to endosomal recycling. Next, by imaging mouse models, we show that the trans-entorhinal cortex, a region most vulnerable to AD, is most susceptible to VPS26b depletion—a finding validated by electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, and behavior. VPS26b was then found enriched in the trans-entorhinal cortex of human brains, where both VPS26b and the retromer-related receptor SORL1 were found deficient in AD. Finally, by regulating glutamate receptor and SORL1 recycling, we show that VPS26b can mediate regionally selective synaptic dysfunction and SORL1 deficiency. Together with the trans-entorhinal’s unique network properties, hypothesized to impose a heavy demand on endosomal recycling, these results suggest a general mechanism that can explain AD’s regional vulnerability.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations can be important biomarkers that influence the selection of specific cancer treatments. We recently combined mathematical modeling of RAS signaling network biochemistry with experimental cancer cell biology to determine why KRAS G13D is a biomarker for sensitivity to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies. The critical mechanistic difference between KRAS G13D and the other most common KRAS mutants is impaired binding to tumor suppressor Neurofibromin (NF1). Here, we hypothesize that impaired binding to NF1 is a “biophysical biomarker” that defines other RAS mutations that retain therapeutic sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. Both computational and experimental investigations support our hypothesis. By screening RAS mutations for this biophysical characteristic, we identify 10 additional RAS mutations that appear to be biomarkers for sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. Altogether, this work suggests that personalized medicine may benefit from migrating from gene-based and allele-based biomarker strategies to biomarkers based on biophysically defined subsets of mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Class-switch recombination (CSR) involves replacement of the Cμ constant region with another downstream CH region. CSR is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated DNA breaks that are targeted to transcriptionally active switch (S) regions. S region promoters (Prs) direct synapsis by associating with the Eμ and 3′Eα enhancers that jointly anchor a chromatin loop. We report that asymmetric loop extrusion allows 3′Eα to track along the locus and form Pr-Pr-E interactions that mediate CSR between downstream S regions, followed by switching to donor Sμ. This alternative pathway bypasses sequential switching and creates immunoglobulin (Ig)E+ B cells in the absence of IgG1 expression. Based on the analysis of diagnostic CSR products in B cell subsets, we identify a BCR-negative cell intermediate that is pivotal to efficient CSR.

Abstract: Summary
The tympanic membrane (TM) is critical for hearing and requires continuous clearing of cellular debris, but little is known about homeostatic mechanisms in the TM epidermis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, lineage tracing, whole-organ explant, and live-cell imaging, we show that homeostatic TM epidermis is distinct from other epidermal sites and has discrete proliferative zones with a three-dimensional hierarchy of multiple keratinocyte populations. TM stem cells reside in a discrete location of the superior TM and generate long-lived clones and committed progenitors (CPs). CP clones exhibit lateral migration, and their proliferative capacity is supported by Pdgfra+ fibroblasts, generating migratory but non-proliferative progeny. Single-cell sequencing of the human TM revealed similar cell types and transcriptional programming. Thus, during homeostasis, TM keratinocytes transit through a proliferative CP state and exhibit directional lateral migration. This work forms a foundation for understanding TM disorders and modeling keratinocyte biology.

Abstract: Summary
Specific classes of GABAergic neurons play specific roles in regulating information processing in the brain. In the hippocampus, two major classes, parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) and somatostatin-expressing (SST+), differentially regulate endogenous firing patterns and target subcellular compartments of principal cells. How these classes regulate the flow of information throughout the hippocampus is poorly understood. We hypothesize that PV+ and SST+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 differentially modulate CA3 patterns of output, thereby altering the influence of CA3 on CA1. We find that while suppressing either interneuron class increases DG and CA3 output, the effects on CA1 were very different. Suppressing PV+ interneurons increases local field potential signatures of coupling from CA3 to CA1 and decreases signatures of coupling from entorhinal cortex to CA1; suppressing SST+ interneurons has the opposite effect. Thus, DG and CA3 PV+ and SST+ interneurons bidirectionally modulate the flow of information through the hippocampal circuit.

Abstract: Summary
Robust expansion of adoptively transferred T cells is a prerequisite for effective cancer immunotherapy, but how many genes in the genome modulate T cell expansion remains unknown. Here, we perform in vivo and in vitro CRISPR screens to systematically identify genes influencing CD8 T cell expansion. In the mouse genome, ∼2,600 and ∼1,500 genes are required for optimal CD8 T cell expansion in vivo and in vitro, respectively. In vivo-specific CD8 T cell essential genes are enriched in metabolic pathways, including mitochondrial metabolism. The strongest repressor of CD8 T cell expansion is Roquin, the ablation of which drastically boosts T cell proliferation by enhancing cell-cycle progression and upregulation of IRF4. Roquin deficiency or IRF4 overexpression potently enhances anti-tumor immunity. These data provide a functional catalog of CD8 T cell fitness genes and suggest that targeting the Roquin-IRF4 axis is an effective strategy to enhance efficacy of adoptive transfer therapy for cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian cells respond to insufficient oxygen through transcriptional regulators called hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Although transiently protective, prolonged HIF activity drives distinct pathological responses in different tissues. Using a model of chronic HIF1a accumulation in pluripotent-stem-cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), we demonstrate that HIF1a activates non-canonical targets to impair generation of oligodendrocytes from OPCs. HIF1a activated a unique set of genes in OPCs through interaction with the OPC-specific transcription factor OLIG2. Non-canonical targets, including Ascl2 and Dlx3, were sufficient to block differentiation through suppression of the oligodendrocyte regulator Sox10. Chemical screening revealed that inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling overcame the HIF1a-mediated block in oligodendrocyte generation by restoring Sox10 expression without affecting canonical HIF1a activity. MEK/ERK inhibition also drove oligodendrocyte formation in hypoxic regions of human oligocortical spheroids. This work defines mechanisms by which HIF1a impairs oligodendrocyte formation and establishes that cell-type-specific HIF1a targets perturb cell function in response to low oxygen.

Abstract: Summary
Intraluminal lymphatic valves (LVs) contribute to the prevention of lymph backflow and maintain circulatory homeostasis. Several reports have investigated the molecular mechanisms which promote LV formation; however, the way in which they are suppressed is not completely clear. We show that the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 is a suppressor of LV formation and maintenance in lymphatic endothelial cells. Oscillatory shear stress by bidirectional flow inactivates FOXO1 via Akt phosphorylation, resulting in the upregulation of a subset of LV-specific genes mediated by downregulation of a transcriptional repressor, PRDM1. Mice with an endothelial-specific Foxo1 deletion have an increase in LVs, and overexpression of Foxo1 in mice produces a decrease in LVs. Genetic reduction of PRDM1 rescues the decrease in LV by Foxo1 overexpression. In conclusion, FOXO1 plays a critical role in lymph flow homeostasis by preventing excess LV formation. This gene might be a therapeutic target for lymphatic circulatory abnormalities.

Abstract: Summary
Wnts are evolutionarily conserved ligands that signal at short range to regulate morphogenesis, cell fate, and stem cell renewal. The first and essential steps in Wnt secretion are their O-palmitoleation and subsequent loading onto the dedicated transporter Wntless/evenness interrupted (WLS/Evi). We report the 3.2 Å resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of palmitoleated human WNT8A in complex with WLS. This is accompanied by biochemical experiments to probe the physiological implications of the observed association. The WLS membrane domain has close structural homology to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A Wnt hairpin inserts into a conserved hydrophobic cavity in the GPCR-like domain, and the palmitoleate protrudes between two helices into the bilayer. A conformational switch of highly conserved residues on a separate Wnt hairpin might contribute to its transfer to receiving cells. This work provides molecular-level insights into a central mechanism in animal body plan development and stem cell biology.

Abstract: Summary
We apply genetic screens to delineate modulators of KRAS mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) sensitivity to ERK inhibitor treatment, and we identify components of the ATR-CHK1 DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of CHK1 alone causes apoptotic growth suppression of both PDAC cell lines and organoids, which correlates with loss of MYC expression. CHK1 inhibition also activates ERK and AMPK and increases autophagy, providing a mechanistic basis for increased efficacy of concurrent CHK1 and ERK inhibition and/or autophagy inhibition with chloroquine. To assess how CHK1 inhibition-induced ERK activation promotes PDAC survival, we perform a CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen targeting direct/indirect ERK substrates and identify RIF1. A key component of non-homologous end joining repair, RIF1 suppression sensitizes PDAC cells to CHK1 inhibition-mediated apoptotic growth suppression. Furthermore, ERK inhibition alone decreases RIF1 expression and phenocopies RIF1 depletion. We conclude that concurrent DDR suppression enhances the efficacy of ERK and/or autophagy inhibitors in KRAS mutant PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
The December 2019 outbreak of a novel respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2, has become an ongoing global pandemic due in part to the challenge of identifying symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus. CRISPR diagnostics can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable, and accurate. Here, we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA that can be read with a mobile phone microscope. The assay achieved ∼100 copies/μL sensitivity in under 30 min of measurement time and accurately detected pre-extracted RNA from a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 min. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity and directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics. Integrated with a reader device based on a mobile phone, this assay has the potential to enable rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening for SARS-CoV-2.

COVID-19 is characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute lung damage associated with patient mortality.

Mechanistically, TNF-α and IFN-γ co-treatment activated the JAK/STAT1/IRF1 axis, inducing nitric oxide production and driving caspase-8/FADD-mediated PANoptosis. TNF-α and IFN-γ caused a lethal cytokine shock in mice that mirrors the tissue damage and inflammation of COVID-19, and inhibiting PANoptosis protected mice from this pathology and death. Furthermore, treating with neutralizing antibodies against TNF-α and IFN-γ protected mice from mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection, sepsis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and cytokine shock. Collectively, our findings suggest that blocking the cytokine-mediated inflammatory cell death signaling pathway identified here may benefit patients with COVID-19 or other infectious and autoinflammatory diseases by limiting tissue damage/inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic bacteria can rapidly respond to stresses such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) using reversible redox-sensitive oxidation of cysteine thiol (-SH) groups in regulators. Here, we use proteomics to profile reversible ROS-induced thiol oxidation in Vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of cholera, and identify two modified cysteines in ArcA, a regulator of global carbon oxidation that is phosphorylated and activated under low oxygen. ROS abolishes ArcA phosphorylation but induces the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond that promotes ArcA-ArcA interactions and sustains activity. ArcA cysteines are oxidized in cholera patient stools, and ArcA thiol oxidation drives in vitro ROS resistance, colonization of ROS-rich guts, and environmental survival. In other pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica, oxidation of conserved cysteines of ArcA orthologs also promotes ROS resistance, suggesting a common role for ROS-induced ArcA thiol oxidation in modulating ArcA activity, allowing for a balance of expression of stress- and pathogenesis-related genetic programs.

Abstract: Summary
Behavior arises from concerted activity throughout the brain. Consequently, a major focus of modern neuroscience is defining the physiology and behavioral roles of projection neurons linking different brain areas. Single-cell RNA sequencing has facilitated these efforts by revealing molecular determinants of cellular physiology and markers that enable genetically targeted perturbations such as optogenetics, but existing methods for sequencing defined projection populations are low throughput, painstaking, and costly. We developed a straightforward, multiplexed approach, virally encoded connectivity transgenic overlay RNA sequencing (VECTORseq). VECTORseq repurposes commercial retrogradely infecting viruses typically used to express functional transgenes (e.g., recombinases and fluorescent proteins) by treating viral transgene mRNA as barcodes within single-cell datasets. VECTORseq is compatible with different viral families, resolves multiple populations with different projection targets in one sequencing run, and identifies cortical and subcortical excitatory and inhibitory projection populations. Our study provides a roadmap for high-throughput identification of neuronal subtypes based on connectivity.

Abstract: Summary
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedding (FFPE) is the most widespread long-term tissue preservation approach. Here, we report a procedure to perform genome-wide spatial analysis of mRNA in FFPE-fixed tissue sections, using well-established, commercially available methods for imaging and spatial barcoding using slides spotted with barcoded oligo(dT) probes to capture the 3′ end of mRNA molecules in tissue sections. We applied this method for expression profiling and cell type mapping in coronal sections from the mouse brain to demonstrate the method’s capability to delineate anatomical regions from a molecular perspective. We also profiled the spatial composition of transcriptomic signatures in two ovarian carcinosarcoma samples, exemplifying the method’s potential to elucidate molecular mechanisms in heterogeneous clinical samples. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the assay to characterize human lung and kidney organoids and a human lung biopsy specimen infected with SARS-CoV-2. We anticipate that genome-wide spatial gene expression profiling in FFPE biospecimens will be used for retrospective analysis of biobank samples, which will facilitate longitudinal studies of biological processes and biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Germline pathogenic mutations in BReast CAncer (BRCA1) genes are thought to drive normal fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cell transformation to high-grade serous ovarian cancer. No human models capture the sequence of events for disease initiation and progression. Here, we generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from healthy individuals and young ovarian cancer patients with germline pathogenic BRCA1 mutations (BRCA1mut). Following differentiation into FTE organoids, BRCA1mut lines exhibit cellular abnormalities consistent with neoplastic transformation compared to controls. BRCA1mut organoids show an increased production of cancer-specific proteins and survival following transplantation into mice. Organoids from women with the most aggressive ovarian cancer show the greatest pathology, indicating the potential value to predict clinical severity prior to disease onset. These human FTE organoids from BRCA1mut carriers provide a faithful physiological in vitro model of FTE lesion generation and early carcinogenesis. This platform can be used for personalized mechanistic and drug screening studies.

Abstract: Summary
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can either promote or prevent T helper 2 (Th2) cell allergic responses. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We show here that LPS activity switches from pro-pathogenic to protective depending on the production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by non-classical monocytes. In the absence of GM-CSF, LPS can favor pathogenic Th2 cell responses by supporting the trafficking of lung-migratory dendritic cells (mDC2s) into the lung-draining lymph node. However, when non-classical monocytes produce GM-CSF, LPS and GM-CSF synergize to differentiate monocyte-derived DCs from classical Ly6Chi monocytes that instruct mDC2s for Th2 cell suppression. Importantly, only allergens with cysteine protease activity trigger GM-CSF production by non-classical monocytes. Hence, the therapeutic effect of LPS is restricted to allergens with this enzymatic activity. Treatment with GM-CSF, however, restores the protective effects of LPS. Thus, GM-CSF produced by non-classical monocytes acts as a rheostat that fine-tunes the pathogenic and therapeutic functions of LPS.

Abstract: Summary
Osteopontin (OPN) has been considered a potential biomarker of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, the function of OPN in GVHD is still elusive. Using a mouse model of acute GVHD (aGVHD), we report that OPN generated by CD4+ T cells is sufficient to exert a beneficial effect in controlling aGVHD through limiting gastrointestinal pathology, a major target organ of aGVHD. CD4+ T cell-derived OPN works on CD44 expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and abates cell death of IECs. OPN also modulates gut microbiota with enhanced health-associated commensal bacteria Akkermansia. Importantly, we use our in vivo mouse mutant model to specifically express OPN isoforms and demonstrate that secreted OPN (sOPN), not intracellular OPN (iOPN), is solely responsible for the protective role of OPN. This study demonstrates that sOPN generated by CD4+ T cells is potent enough to limit aGVHD.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeric α-satellite repeats represent ∼6% of the human genome, but their length and repetitive nature make sequencing and analysis of those regions challenging. However, centromeres are essential for the stable propagation of chromosomes, so tools are urgently needed to monitor centromere copy number and how it influences chromosome transmission and genome stability. We developed and benchmarked droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays that measure copy number for five human centromeric arrays. We applied them to characterize natural variation in centromeric array size, analyzing normal tissue from 37 individuals from China and 39 individuals from the US and UK. Each chromosome-specific array varies in size up to 10-fold across individuals and up to 50-fold across chromosomes, indicating a unique complement of arrays in each individual. We also used the ddPCR assays to analyze centromere copy number in 76 matched tumor-normal samples across four cancer types, representing the most-comprehensive quantitative analysis of centromeric array stability in cancer to date. In contrast to stable transmission in cultured cells, centromeric arrays show gain and loss events in each of the cancer types, suggesting centromeric α-satellite DNA represents a new category of genome instability in cancer. Our methodology for measuring human centromeric-array copy number will advance research on centromeres and genome integrity in normal and disease states.

Abstract: Summary
Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease with high fatality. Poor prognosis of SFTS has been associated with dysregulated host immunity; however, the immune patterns associated with pathophysiology involving SFTS exacerbation remain unclear. Here, we show that the single-cell landscape of peripheral immune responses is reprogrammed in SFTS and characterized by monocyte shift to an intermediate type along with complement activation, perturbation of plasmablast composition, and highly exhausted T cells, all correlated with lethal consequences. We identify the overexpression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes across most immune cell types after SFTSV infection, which are simultaneously related to older age, high viremia, and a hyperinflammatory response. A retrospective clinical study reveals no efficiency of IFN-α in treating SFTS. These data collectively support the intermediate monocytes and IFN-I-inducible plasmablasts to be major targets for SFTS virus infection, and they indicate the pivotal role of the IFN-I response in exacerbating hyperinflammation and lethal SFTS.

Abstract: Summary
Non-neuronal responses in neurodegenerative disease have received increasing attention as important contributors to disease pathogenesis and progression. Here we utilize single-cell RNA sequencing to broadly profile 13 cell types in three different mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD), capturing the effects of tau-only, amyloid-only, or combined tau-amyloid pathology. We highlight microglia, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and T cell responses and compare them across these models. Notably, we identify two distinct transcriptional states for oligodendrocytes emerging differentially across disease models, and we determine their spatial distribution. Furthermore, we explore the impact of Trem2 deletion in the context of combined pathology. Trem2 knockout mice exhibit severely blunted microglial responses to combined tau and amyloid pathology, but responses from non-microglial cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and T cells) are relatively unchanged. These results delineate core transcriptional states that are engaged in response to AD pathology, and how they are influenced by a key AD risk gene, Trem2.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the pro-degenerative protein SARM1 after diverse physical and disease-relevant injuries causes programmed axon degeneration. Original studies indicate that substantially decreased SARM1 levels are required for neuroprotection. However, we demonstrate, in Sarm1 haploinsufficient mice, that lowering SARM1 levels by 50% delays programmed axon degeneration in vivo after sciatic nerve transection and partially prevents neurite outgrowth defects in mice lacking the pro-survival factor NMNAT2. In vitro, the rate of degeneration in response to traumatic, neurotoxic, and genetic triggers of SARM1 activation is also slowed. Finally, we demonstrate that Sarm1 antisense oligonucleotides decrease SARM1 levels by more than 50% in vitro, which delays or prevents programmed axon degeneration. Combining Sarm1 haploinsufficiency with antisense oligonucleotides further decreases SARM1 levels and prolongs protection after neurotoxic injury. These data demonstrate that axon protection occurs in a Sarm1 gene dose-responsive manner and that SARM1-lowering agents have therapeutic potential, making Sarm1-targeting antisense oligonucleotides a promising therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons that signal the angular velocity of head movements (AHV cells) are important for processing visual and spatial information. However, it has been challenging to isolate the sensory modality that drives them and to map their cortical distribution. To address this, we develop a method that enables rotating awake, head-fixed mice under a two-photon microscope in a visual environment. Starting in layer 2/3 of the retrosplenial cortex, a key area for vision and navigation, we find that 10% of neurons report angular head velocity (AHV). Their tuning properties depend on vestibular input with a smaller contribution of vision at lower speeds. Mapping the spatial extent, we find AHV cells in all cortical areas that we explored, including motor, somatosensory, visual, and posterior parietal cortex. Notably, the vestibular and visual contributions to AHV are area dependent. Thus, many cortical circuits have access to AHV, enabling a diverse integration with sensorimotor and cognitive information.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining genomic integrity and stability is crucial for life; yet, no tissue-driven mechanism that robustly safeguards the epithelial genome has been discovered. Epidermal stem cells (EpiSCs) continuously replenish the stratified layers of keratinocytes that protect organisms against various environmental stresses. To study the dynamics of DNA-damaged cells in tissues, we devised an in vivo fate tracing system for EpiSCs with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and demonstrated that those cells exit from their niches. The clearance of EpiSCs with DSBs is caused by selective differentiation and delamination through the DNA damage response (DDR)-p53-Notch/p21 axis, with the downregulation of ITGB1. Moreover, concomitant enhancement of symmetric cell divisions of surrounding stem cells indicates that the selective elimination of cells with DSBs is coupled with the augmented clonal expansion of intact stem cells. These data collectively demonstrate that tissue autonomy through the dynamic coupling of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms coordinately maintains the genomic quality of the epidermis.

Previous analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from human naive pluripotent stem cells reported multiple point “mutations” in cancer-related genes and implicated selective culture conditions. We observed, however, that those mutations were only present in co-cultures with mouse feeder cells. Inspection of reads containing the polymorphisms revealed complete identity to the mouse reference genome. After we filtered reads to remove sequences of mouse origin, the actual incidence of oncogenic polymorphisms arising in naive pluripotent stem cells is close to zero.

Abstract: Summary
GABAergic synaptic inhibition controls neuronal firing, excitability, and synaptic plasticity to regulate neuronal circuits. Following an acute excitotoxic insult, inhibitory synapses are eliminated, reducing synaptic inhibition, elevating circuit excitability, and contributing to the pathophysiology of brain injuries. However, mechanisms that drive inhibitory synapse disassembly and elimination are undefined. We find that inhibitory synapses are disassembled in a sequential manner following excitotoxicity: GABAARs undergo rapid nanoscale rearrangement and are dispersed from the synapse along with presynaptic active zone components, followed by the gradual removal of the gephyrin scaffold, prior to complete elimination of the presynaptic terminal. GABAAR nanoscale reorganization and synaptic declustering depends on calcineurin signaling, whereas disassembly of gephyrin relies on calpain activation, and blockade of both enzymes preserves inhibitory synapses after excitotoxic insult. Thus, inhibitory synapse disassembly occurs rapidly, with nanoscale precision, in a stepwise manner and most likely represents a critical step in the progression of hyperexcitability following excitotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Newly synthesized glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) undergo extensive remodeling prior to transport to the plasma membrane. GPI-AP remodeling events serve as quality assurance signatures, and complete remodeling of the anchor functions as a transport warrant. Using a genetic approach in yeast cells, we establish that one remodeling event, the removal of ethanolamine-phosphate from mannose 2 via Ted1p (yPGAP5), is essential for cell viability in the absence of the Golgi-localized putative phosphodiesterase Dcr2p. While GPI-APs in which mannose 2 has not been remodeled in dcr2 ted1-deficient cells can still be delivered to the plasma membrane, their presence elicits a unique stress response. Stress is sensed by Mid2p, a constituent of the cell wall integrity pathway, whereupon signal promulgation culminates in activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Our results are consistent with a model in which cellular stress response and chromosome segregation checkpoint pathways are functionally interconnected.
