Abstract: Summary
Many viruses deliver their genomes into the host cell nucleus for replication. However, the size restrictions of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which regulates the passage of proteins, nucleic acids, and solutes through the nuclear envelope, require virus capsid uncoating before viral DNA can access the nucleus. We report a microtubule motor kinesin-1-mediated and NPC-supported mechanism of adenovirus uncoating. The capsid binds to the NPC filament protein Nup214 and kinesin-1 light-chain Klc1/2. The nucleoporin Nup358, which is bound to Nup214/Nup88, interacts with the kinesin-1 heavy-chain Kif5c to indirectly link the capsid to the kinesin motor. Kinesin-1 disrupts capsids docked at Nup214, which compromises the NPC and dislocates nucleoporins and capsid fragments into the cytoplasm. NPC disruption increases nuclear envelope permeability as indicated by the nuclear influx of large cytoplasmic dextran polymers. Thus, kinesin-1 uncoats viral DNA and compromises NPC integrity, allowing viral genomes nuclear access to promote infection.

Abstract: Summary
Herpesviruses, which are major human pathogens, establish life-long persistent infections. Although the α, β, and γ herpesviruses infect different tissues and cause distinct diseases, they each encode a conserved serine/threonine kinase that is critical for virus replication and spread. The extent of substrate conservation and the key common cell-signaling pathways targeted by these kinases are unknown. Using a human protein microarray high-throughput approach, we identify shared substrates of the conserved kinases from herpes simplex virus, human cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. DNA damage response (DDR) proteins were statistically enriched, and the histone acetyltransferase TIP60, an upstream regulator of the DDR pathway, was required for efficient herpesvirus replication. During EBV replication, TIP60 activation by the BGLF4 kinase triggers EBV-induced DDR and also mediates induction of viral lytic gene expression. Identification of key cellular targets of the conserved herpesvirus kinases will facilitate the development of broadly effective antiviral strategies.

Abstract: We demonstrated for the first time the distribution and morphology of argyrophil and of goblet cells in the mucosa of the small intestine of the Muscovy duck during development using the Grimelius silver staining and alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (AB/PAS) staining technique. The argyrophil cells distribution was variable over the length of the small intestine from embryonic day 24 (24E) to post-hatching day 13 (13d). In the villi most argyrophil cells belonged to the open-type, while in the crypts they belonged to the closed-type. In the duodenum the density of argyrophil cells was highest at hatching, while in the jejunum and in the ileum the highest density value was at hatching and 13d. AB/PAS-positive goblet cells appeared on the villi and crypts of the duodenum and jejunum at 30E, and in the ileum at hatching. The density of AB/PAS-positive cells was the highest in the three segments at hatching. The AB-positive cells, compared with the PAS-positive cells, predominated in villi and crypts of the three segments, moreover the rate of AB-positive cells to PAS-positive cells significantly decreased from 30E to 9d. An increase in argyrophil and goblet cells number during the later incubation and at hatching, could indicate the small intestine in that period is being prepared to face a new diet.

Abstract: b>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in induction of innate immune responses for host defense against invading microbial pathogens. Microbial component engagement of TLRs can trigger the activation of myeloid differential factor 88 (MyD88)- and toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent downstream signaling pathways. Parthenolide, an active ingredient of feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), has been used for centuries to treat many chronic diseases. Parthenolide inhibits the MyD88-dependent pathway by inhibiting the activity of inhibitor-κB kinase. However, it is not known whether parthenolide inhibits the TRIF-dependent pathway. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of parthenolide, its effect on signal transduction via the TRIF-dependent pathway of TLRs induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly [I:C]) was examined. Parthenolide inhibited nuclear factor κB and interferon regulatory factor 3 activation induced by LPS or poly[I:C], and the LPS-induced phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 as well as interferon-inducible genes such as interferon inducible protein-10. These results suggest that parthenolide can modulate TRIF-dependent signaling pathways of TLRs, and may be the basis of effective therapeutics for chronic inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Summary
During invasion, apicomplexan parasites form an intimate circumferential contact with the host cell, the tight junction (TJ), through which they actively glide. The TJ, which links the parasite motor to the host cell cytoskeleton, is thought to be composed of interacting apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and rhoptry neck (RON) proteins. Here we find that, in Plasmodium berghei, while both AMA1 and RON4 are important for merozoite invasion of erythrocytes, only RON4 is required for sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes, indicating that RON4 acts independently of AMA1 in the sporozoite. Further, in the Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoite, AMA1 is dispensable for normal RON4 ring and functional TJ assembly but enhances tachyzoite apposition to the cell and internalization frequency. We propose that while the RON proteins act at the TJ, AMA1 mainly functions on the zoite surface to permit correct attachment to the cell, which may facilitate invasion depending on the zoite-cell combination.

Abstract: Summary
HP1 proteins are central to the assembly and spread of heterochromatin containing histone H3K9 methylation. The chromodomain (CD) of HP1 proteins specifically recognizes the methyl mark on H3 peptides, but the same extent of specificity is not observed within chromatin. The chromoshadow domain of HP1 proteins promotes homodimerization, but this alone cannot explain heterochromatin spread. Using the S. pombe HP1 protein, Swi6, we show that recognition of H3K9-methylated chromatin in vitro relies on an interface between two CDs. This interaction causes Swi6 to tetramerize on a nucleosome, generating two vacant CD sticky ends. On nucleosomal arrays, methyl mark recognition is highly sensitive to internucleosomal distance, suggesting that the CD sticky ends bridge nearby methylated nucleosomes. Strengthening the CD-CD interaction enhances silencing and heterochromatin spread in vivo. Our findings suggest that recognition of methylated nucleosomes and HP1 spread on chromatin are structurally coupled and imply that methylation and nucleosome arrangement synergistically regulate HP1 function.

Abstract: Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a frequently occurring malignant salivary gland neoplasm with high level of recurrence and distant metastasis long time after treatment. Metastatic tumor cells that actively migrate and invade surrounding tissues rely on invadopodia to degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) barriers. Invadopodia are actin-rich membrane protrusions that localize enzymes required for ECM degradation. Breakdown of ECM macromolecules releases fragments and bioactive peptides. We have already demonstrated that laminin-111 and its derived peptides regulate migration, invasion and protease activity of adenocarcinoma cells. Here we addressed the role of laminin-111 peptides AG73 and C16 in invadopodia activity of cells (CAC2) derived from human adenoid cystic carcinoma. CAC2 cells were treated by AG73 and C16, and subjected to fluorescent gelatin substrate degradation assay. In this assay invadopodia activity areas appear as black dots in a fluorescent background. Both peptides significantly increased invadopodia formation and activity compared to controls. We analyzed putative receptors and signaling pathways related to peptide effects. β1 integrin silencing by siRNA decreased AG73- and C16-induced invadopodia. Furthermore inhibition of Rac1 and ERK signaling pathways decreased both C16- and AG73-related invadopodia activities. We propose that laminin-111 peptides AG73 and C16 increase invadopodia activity in CAC2 cells through β1 integrin. Rac1 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways would transduce signals generated by both peptides.

Abstract: Summary
Protein methylation pathways comprise methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), which produces S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and SAM-dependent substrate-specific methyltransferases. However, the function of MAT in the nucleus is largely unknown. MafK represses or activates expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene, depending on its heterodimer partners. Proteomics analysis of MafK revealed its interaction with MATIIα, a MAT isozyme. MATIIα was localized in nuclei and found to form a dense network with chromatin-related proteins including Swi/Snf and NuRD complexes. MATIIα was recruited to Maf recognition element (MARE) at HO-1 gene. When MATIIα was knocked down in murine hepatoma cell line, expression of HO-1 was derepressed at both basal and induced levels. The catalytic activity of MATIIα, as well as its interacting factors such as MATIIβ, BAF53a, CHD4, and PARP1, was required for HO-1 repression. MATII serves as a transcriptional corepressor of MafK by interacting with chromatin regulators and supplying SAM for methyltransferases.

Abstract: Hertwig’s epithelial root sheath/Epithelial rests of Malassez (HERS/ERM) cells are unique epithelial cells in the periodontal ligament. They remain in periodontal tissues throughout the adult life, and it is expected that their functional role is to maintain the homeostasis of the periodontium through reciprocal interactions with other periodontal cells. In this study, we investigated whether HERS/ERM cells have primitive stem cell characteristics: those of embryonic stem cells as well as of epithelial stem cells. Primary HERS/ERM cells had typical epithelial cell morphology and characteristics and they maintained for more than five passages. They expressed epithelial stem cell-related genes: ABCG2, ΔNp63, p75, EpCAM, and Bmi-1. Moreover, the expression of embryonic stem cell markers such as Oct-4, Nanog, and SSEA-4 were detected. Next, we investigated whether the expression of these stem cell markers was maintained during the sub-culture process. HERS/ERM cells showed different expression levels of these stemness genes at each passage, but their expression was maintained throughout the passages. Taken together, our data suggest that a primary culture of HERS/ERM cells contains a population of primitive stem cells that express epithelial stem cell markers and embryonic stem cell markers. Furthermore, these cell populations were maintained during the sub-culturing process in our culture conditions. Therefore, our findings suggest that there is a strong possibility of accomplishing cementum tissue engineering with HERS/ERM cells.

Abstract: Summary
Proper bipolar attachment of sister kinetochores to the mitotic spindle is critical for accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis. Here we show an essential role of the formin mDia3 in achieving metaphase chromosome alignment. This function is independent of mDia3 actin nucleation activity, but is attributable to EB1-binding by mDia3. Furthermore, the microtubule binding FH2 domain of mDia3 is phosphorylated by Aurora B kinase in vitro, and cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable mDia3 mutant cannot position chromosomes at the metaphase plate. Purified recombinant mDia3 phosphorylated by Aurora B exhibits reduced ability to bind microtubules and stabilize microtubules against cold-induced disassembly in vitro. Cells expressing the phosphomimetic mDia3 mutant do not form stable kinetochore microtubule fibers; despite they are able to congress chromosomes to the metaphase plate. These findings reveal a key role for mDia3 and its regulation by Aurora B phosphorylation in achieving proper stable kinetochore microtubule attachment.

Abstract: Summary
Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs, serotypes A–G), elaborated by Clostridium botulinum, can induce lethal paralysis and are classified as Category A bioterrorism agents. However, how BoNTs translocate from endosomes into the cytosol of neurons to gain access to their intracellular targets remains enigmatic. We discovered that binding to the ganglioside GT1b, a toxin coreceptor, enables BoNT/B to sense low pH, undergo a significant change in secondary structure, and transform into a hydrophobic oligomeric membrane protein. Imaging of the toxin on lipid bilayers using atomic force microscopy revealed donut-shaped channel-like structures that resemble other protein translocation assemblies. Toosendanin, a drug with therapeutic effects against botulism, inhibited GT1b-dependent BoNT/B oligomerization and in parallel truncated BoNT/B single-channel conductance, suggesting that oligomerization plays a role in the translocation reaction. Thus, BoNT/B functions as a coincidence detector for receptor and low pH to ensure spatial and temporal accuracy for toxin conversion into a translocation channel.

Abstract: To study the effect of the ret1-1 mutation on the secretome, the glycosylation patterns and locations of the secretory proteins and glycosyltransferases responsible for glycosylation were investigated. Analyses of secretory proteins and cell wall-associated glycoproteins showed severe impairment of glycosylation in this mutant. Results from 2D-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) indicated defects in the glycosylation and cellular localization of SDS-soluble cell wall proteins. Localization of RFP-tagged glycosyltransferase proteins in ret1-1 indicated an impairment of Golgi-to retrograde transport at a non-permissive temperature. Thus, impaired glycosylation caused by the mislocalization of ER resident proteins appears to be responsible for the alterations in the secretome and the increased sensitivity to ER stress in ret1-1 mutant cells.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) function as molecular chaperones during the folding and trafficking of proteins within most cell types. However, the Hsp70–Hsp40 chaperone partnerships within the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, have not been elucidated. Only one of the 43 P. falciparum Hsp40s is predicted to be a cytosolic, canonical Hsp40 (termed PfHsp40) capable of interacting with the major cytosolic P. falciparum-encoded Hsp70, PfHsp70. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that PfHsp40 is upregulated under heat shock conditions in a similar pattern to PfHsp70. In addition, PfHsp70 and PfHsp40 reside mainly in the parasite cytosol, as assessed using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Recombinant PfHsp40 stimulated the ATP hydrolytic rates of both PfHsp70 and human Hsp70 similar to other canonical Hsp40s of yeast (Ydj1) and human (Hdj2) origin. In contrast, the Hsp40-stimulated plasmodial and human Hsp70 ATPase activities were differentially inhibited in the presence of pyrimidinone-based small molecule modulators. To further probe the chaperone properties of PfHsp40, protein aggregation suppression assays were conducted. PfHsp40 alone suppressed protein aggregation, and cooperated with PfHsp70 to suppress aggregation. Together, these data represent the first cellular and biochemical evidence for a PfHsp70–PfHsp40 partnership in the malaria parasite, and furthermore that the plasmodial and human Hsp70–Hsp40 chaperones possess unique attributes that are differentially modulated by small molecules.

Abstract: The neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Cytoplasmic SMN protein-containing granules, known as U snRNP bodies (U bodies), are thought to be responsible for the assembly and storage of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing. U bodies exhibit close association with cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies), which are involved in mRNA decay and translational repression. The close association of the U body and P body in Drosophila resemble that of the stress granule and P body in yeast and mammalian cells. However, it is unknown whether the U body is responsive to any stress. Using Drosophila oogenesis as a model, here we show that U bodies increase in size following nutritional deprivation. Despite nutritional stress, U bodies maintain their close association with P bodies. Our results show that U bodies are responsive to nutrition changes, presumably through the U body–P body pathway.

Abstract: Summary
iNKT cells are innate T lymphocytes recognizing endogenous and foreign lipid antigens presented in the MHC-like molecule CD1d. The semi-invariant iNKT cell TCR can detect certain bacterial and parasitic lipids and drive iNKT cell responses. How iNKT cells respond to fungi, however, is unknown. We found that CD1d-deficient mice, which lack iNKT cells, poorly control infection with the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Furthermore, A. fumigatus rapidly activates iNKT cells in vivo and in vitro in the presence of APCs. Surprisingly, despite a requirement for CD1d recognition, the antifungal iNKT cell response does not require fungal lipids. Instead, Dectin-1- and MyD88-mediated responses to β-1,3 glucans, major fungal cell-wall polysaccharides, trigger IL-12 production by APCs that drives self-reactive iNKT cells to secrete IFN-γ. Innate recognition of β-1,3 glucans also drives iNKT cell responses against Candida, Histoplasma, and Alternaria, suggesting that this mechanism may broadly define the basis for antifungal iNKT cell responses.

Abstract: Summary
To infect plants, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato delivers ∼30 type III effector proteins into host cells, many of which interfere with PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). One effector, AvrPtoB, suppresses PTI using a central domain to bind host BAK1, a kinase that acts with several pattern recognition receptors to activate defense signaling. A second AvrPtoB domain binds and suppresses the PTI-associated kinase Bti9 but is conversely recognized by the protein kinase Pto to activate effector-triggered immunity. We report the crystal structure of the AvrPtoB-BAK1 complex, which revealed structural similarity between these two AvrPtoB domains, suggesting that they arose by intragenic duplication. The BAK1 kinase domain is structurally similar to Pto, and a conserved region within both BAK1 and Pto interacts with AvrPtoB. BAK1 kinase activity is inhibited by AvrPtoB, and mutations at the interaction interface disrupt AvrPtoB virulence activity. These results shed light on a structural mechanism underlying host-pathogen coevolution.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cells exhibit aberrant metabolism characterized by high glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen. This metabolic reprogramming, known as the Warburg effect, provides tumor cells with the substrates required for biomass generation. Here, we show that the mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT3 is a crucial regulator of the Warburg effect. Mechanistically, SIRT3 mediates metabolic reprogramming by destabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α), a transcription factor that controls glycolytic gene expression. SIRT3 loss increases reactive oxygen species production, leading to HIF1α stabilization. SIRT3 expression is reduced in human breast cancers, and its loss correlates with the upregulation of HIF1α target genes. Finally, we find that SIRT3 overexpression represses glycolysis and proliferation in breast cancer cells, providing a metabolic mechanism for tumor suppression.

Abstract: We show that lobster olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), much like their vertebrate counterparts, generate a transient elevation of intracellular calcium (Cai) in response to odorant activation that can be used to monitor ensemble ORN activity. This is done in antennal slice preparation in situ maintaining the polarity of the cells and the normal micro-environment of the olfactory cilia. The Cai signal is ligand-specific and increases in a dose-dependent manner in response to odorant stimulation. Saturating stimulation elicits a robust increase of up to 1μM free Cai within 1–2s of stimulation. The odor-induced Cai response closely follows the discharge pattern of extracellular spikes elicited by odorant application, with the maximal rise in Cai matching the peak of the spike generation. The Cai signal can be used to track neuronal activity in a functional subpopulation of rhythmically active ORNs and discriminate it from that of neighboring tonically active ORNs. Being able to record from many ORNs simultaneously over an extended period of time not only allows more accurate estimates of neuronal population activity but also dramatically improves the ability to identify potential new functional subpopulations of ORNs, especially those with more subtle differences in responsiveness, ligand specificity, and/or transduction mechanisms.

Abstract: Interphasic chromatin condenses into the chromosomes in order to facilitate the correct segregation of genetic information. It has been previously reported that the phosphorylation and methylation of the N-terminal tail of histone H3 are responsible for chromosome condensation. In this study, we demonstrate that the deacetylation and methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) are required for proper chromosome condensation. We confirmed that H3K9ac levels were reduced, whereas H3K9me3 levels were increased in mitotic cells, via immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Nocodazole treatment induced G2/M arrest but co-treatment with TSA, an HDAC inhibitor, delayed cell cycle progression. However, the HMTase inhibitor, AdoX, had no effect on nocodazole-induced G2/M arrest, thereby indicating that sequential modifications of H3K9 are required for proper chromosome condensation. The expression of SUV39H1 and SETDB1, H3K9me3-responsible HMTases, are specifically increased along with H3K9me3 in nocodazole-arrested buoyant cells, which suggests that the increased expression of those proteins is an important step in chromosome condensation. H3K9me3 was highly concentrated in the vertical chromosomal axis during prophase and prometaphase. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that sequential modifications at H3K9 are associated with correct chromosome condensation, and that H3K9me3 may be relevant to the condensation of chromosome length.

Abstract: Summary
Adipocytes store triglyceride during periods of nutritional affluence and release free fatty acids during fasting through coordinated cycles of lipogenesis and lipolysis. While much is known about the acute regulation of these processes during fasting and feeding, less is understood about the transcriptional basis by which adipocytes control lipid handling. Here, we show that interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is a critical determinant of the transcriptional response to nutrient availability in adipocytes. Fasting induces IRF4 in an insulin- and FoxO1-dependent manner. IRF4 is required for lipolysis, at least in part due to direct effects on the expression of adipocyte triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase. Conversely, reduction of IRF4 enhances lipid synthesis. Mice lacking adipocyte IRF4 exhibit increased adiposity and deficient lipolysis. These studies establish a link between IRF4 and the disposition of calories in adipose tissue, with consequences for systemic metabolic homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Kaposi sarcoma (KS), an angioproliferative disease associated with Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) infection, harbors a diversity of cell types ranging from endothelial to mesenchymal cells of unclear origin. We developed a three-dimensional cell model for KSHV infection and used it to demonstrate that KSHV induces transcriptional reprogramming of lymphatic endothelial cells to mesenchymal cells via endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). KSHV-induced EndMT was initiated by the viral proteins vFLIP and vGPCR through Notch pathway activation, leading to gain of membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP)-dependent invasive properties and concomitant changes in viral gene expression. Mesenchymal markers and MT1-MMP were found codistributed with a KSHV marker in the same cells from primary KS biopsies. Our data explain the heterogeneity of cell types within KS lesions and suggest that KSHV-induced EndMT may contribute to KS development by giving rise to infected, invasive cells while providing the virus a permissive cellular microenvironment for efficient spread.

Abstract: Summary
Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are major transcription factors activating the expression of genes involved in biosynthesis of cholesterol, fatty acid and triglyceride. In this study, we identified a small molecule, betulin, that specifically inhibited the maturation of SREBP by inducing interaction of SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP) and Insig. Inhibition of SREBP by betulin decreased the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acid. In vivo, betulin ameliorated diet-induced obesity, decreased the lipid contents in serum and tissues, and increased insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, betulin reduced the size and improved the stability of atherosclerotic plaques. Our study demonstrates that inhibition SREBP pathway can be employed as a therapeutic strategy to treat metabolic diseases including type II diabetes and atherosclerosis. Betulin, which is abundant in birch bark, could be a leading compound for development of drugs for hyperlipidemia.

Abstract: Mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) are being employed as an important model for translational research into the development of DC-based therapeutics. For such use, the localization and specialized mobility of injected BMDCs within specific immune tissues are known to define their immunity and usefulness in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-4, a key driving factor for in vitro propagation and differentiation of BMDCs, when added during a late culture stage can enhance the in vivo trafficking activity of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-induced BMDCs. It suggests that the temporal control of IL-4 stimulation during the in vitro generation of DCs drastically affects the DC trafficking efficiency in vivo. With this modification of IL-4 stimulation, we also show that much less cytokine was needed to generate BMDCs with high purity and yield that secrete a high level of cytokines and possess a good capacity to induce proliferation of allogeneic CD4+T cells, as compared to the conventional method that uses a continuous supplement of GM-CSF and IL-4 throughout cultivation. These results provide us with an important know-how for differentiation of BMDCs from myeloid stem cells, and for use of other immune cells in related medical or stem cell applications.

Abstract: Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), the catalytic subunit of the enzyme telomerase, is robustly expressed in cancer cells. TERT enables cells to avoid chromosome shortening during repeated replication by maintaining telomere length. However, several lines of evidence indicate that many cancer cells exhibit shorter telomere length than normal tissues, implying an additional function of TERT in tumor formation and progression. Here, we report a telomerase activity-independent function of TERT that induces cancer stemness in glioma cells. Overexpression of TERT712, a telomerase activity-deficient form of TERT, in U87MG cells promoted cell self-renewal in vitro, and induced EGFR expression and formation of gliomas exhibiting cellular heterogeneity in vivo. In patients with glioblastoma multiforme, TERT expression showed a high correlation with EGFR expression, which is closely linked to the stemness gene signature. Induction of differentiation and TERT-knockdown in glioma stem cells led to a marked reduction in EGFR expression, cancer stemness, and anticancer drug resistance. Together, our findings indicate that TERT plays a crucial role in tumor progression by promoting cancer stemness through expression of EGFR.

Abstract: The inability of cells to maintain protein folding homeostasis is implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, malignant transformation, and aging. We find that multiphoton fluorescence imaging of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) can be used to assess cellular responses to protein misfolding stresses. ANS is relatively nontoxic and enters live cells and cells or tissues fixed in formalin. In an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease, ANS fluorescence imaging of brain tissue sections reveals the binding of ANS to fibrillar deposits of amyloid peptide (Aβ) in amyloid plaques and in cerebrovascular amyloid. ANS imaging also highlights non-amyloid deposits of glial fibrillary acidic protein in brain tumors. Cultured cells under normal growth conditions possess a number of ANS-binding structures. High levels of ANS fluorescence are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and lysosomes—regions of protein folding and degradation. Nuclei are virtually devoid of ANS binding sites. Additional ANS binding is triggered by hyperthermia, thermal lesioning, proteasome inhibition, and induction of ER stress. We also use multiphoton imaging of ANS binding to follow the in vivo recovery of cells from protein-damaging insults over time. We find that ANS fluorescence tracks with the binding of the molecular chaperone Hsp70 in compartments where Hsp70 is present. ANS highlights the sensitivity of specific cellular targets, including the nucleus and particularly the nucleolus, to thermal stress and proteasome inhibition. Multiphoton imaging of ANS binding should be a useful probe for monitoring protein misfolding stress in cells.

Abstract: Wogonin is a one of the bioactive compounds of Scutellaria baicalensi Georgi which has been shown to have antiinflammatory, anticancer, antiviral and neuroprotective effects. However, the underlying mechanisms by which wogonin induces apoptosis in cancer cells still remain speculative. Here we investigated the potential activation of MAPKs and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by wogonin on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. These results showed that wogonin induced mitochondria and death-receptor-mediated apoptotic cell death, which was characterized by activation of several caspases, induction of PARP cleavage, change of antiapoptotic/proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member ratios and cleavage of Bid. We also found that generation of ROS was an important mediator in wogonin-induced apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that wogonin activated ERK and p38 MAPKs, which was inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, indicating that wogonin-induced ROS are associated with MAPKs activation. These data demonstrate that wogonin may be a novel anticancer agent for treatment of breast cancer.

Abstract: Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Cardiovirus genus in the family Picornaviridae. In addition to other host cellular factors and pathways, picornaviruses utilise heat shock proteins (Hsps) to facilitate their propagation in cells. This study investigated the localisation of Hsps 70 and 90 in TMEV-infected BHK-21 cells by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. The effect of Hsp90 inhibitors novobiocin (Nov) and geldanamycin (GA) on the development of cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by infection was also examined. Hsp90 staining was uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells but was found concentrated in the perinuclear region during late infection where it overlapped with the signal for non-structural protein 2C within the viral replication complex. Hsp70 redistributed into the vicinity of the viral replication complex during late infection, but its distribution did not overlap with that of 2C. Inhibition of Hsp90 by GA and Nov had a negative effect on virus growth over a 48-h period as indicated by no observable CPE in treated compared to untreated cells. 2C was detected by Western analysis of GA-treated infected cell lysates at doses between 0.01 and 0.125 μM, suggesting that processing of viral precursors was not affected in the presence of this drug. In contrast, 2C was absent in cell lysates of Nov-treated cells at doses above 10 μM, although CPE was evident 48 hpi. This is the first study describing the dynamic behaviour of Hsps 70 and 90 in TMEV-infected cells and to identify Hsp90 as an important host factor in the life cycle of this virus.

Abstract: The cell fate determinant NUMB orchestrates asymmetric cell division in flies and mammals and has lately been suggested to have a tumor suppressor function in breast and lung cancer. Here, we studied NUMB in the context of malignant gliomas. We used ectopic expression of NUMB in order to inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation in glioma cells by alteration of Notch, Hedgehog and p53 signaling. We found that NUMB is consistently expressed in glioma biopsies with predominance of NUMB2/4 isoforms as determined by isoform-specific real-time PCR and Western blotting. Upon lentiviral overexpression, in vitro proliferation rate and the grade of differentiation as assessed by morphology and expression of neural and glial markers remained unchanged. Orthotopic xenografts of NUMB-transduced human U87 glioma cells could be established in nude rats without impairing engraftment or causing significant changes in morphology based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The previously reported alteration of Hedgehog and p53 signaling by NUMB could not be recapitulated in glioma cells. We thus show that in experimental gliomas, NUMB overexpression most likely does not exert a tumor suppressor function such as seen in epithelial cancers.

Abstract: The novel proton conductor BaCe0.7In0.2Yb0.1O3-δ (BCIYb) has been successfully synthesized by a modified Pechini method, and characterized as an electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells. Acceptable tolerance to wet CO2 environment was found during chemical stability tests. No interaction between the BCIYb electrolyte and the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) cathode was observed during the cathode fabrication process. Further, no detectable impurity phase was found when the BCIYb—LSCF mixed powders were calcined at 700°C for 50 h. BCIYb dense samples sintered at 1450°C for 5 h showed acceptable conductivities of 7.2 × 10−3, 8 × 10−3, 4.5 × 10−3 and 3.1 × 10−3 S/cm at 800°C in dry air, wet air, wet H2 and wet N2, respectively. The maximum cell power outputs of single cells with the configuration of Ni—BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ (BZCY)|BCIYb|BZCY—LSCF were 0.15, 0.218 and 0.28 W/cm2 at 600, 650 and 700°C, respectively. No cell degradation was observed for cells operated at a constant voltage of 0.7 V in the 25 h short-term durability test.

Abstract: To explore the effects of both external and internal pH (pHo and pHi) on the coupling between Ca2+ extrusion and H+ uptake by the PMCA activity in snail neurones H+ uptake was assessed by measuring surface pH changes (ΔpHs) with pH-sensitive microelectrodes while Ba2+ or Ca2+ loads were extruded. Ru360 or ruthenium red injection showed that injected Ca2+ was partly taken up by mitochondria, but Ca2+ entering through channels was not. External pH was changed using a mixture of three buffers to minimise changes in buffering power. With depolarisation-induced Ca2+ or Ba2+ loads the ΔpHs were not changed significantly over the pH range 6.5–8.5. With Ca2+ injections into cells with mitochondrial uptake blocked the ΔpHs were significantly smaller at pH 8.5 than at 7.5, but this could be explained in part by the slower rate of activity of the PMCA. Low intracellular pH also changed the ΔpHs responses to Ca2+ injection, but not significantly. Again this may have been due to reduced pump activity at low pHi. I conclude that in snail neurones the PMCA coupling ratio is either insensitive or much less sensitive to pH than in red blood cells or barnacle muscle.

Abstract: Summary
The innate and adaptive immune responses that confer resistance to the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii critically depend on IL-12 production, which drives interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression. Certain cytokines can activate STAT3 and limit IL-12 production to prevent infection-associated immune pathology, but T. gondii also directly activates STAT3 to evade host immunity. We show that suppressor of cytokine signaling molecule 3 (SOCS3), a target of STAT3 that limits signaling by the pleiotropic cytokine IL-6, is upregulated in response to infection but is dispensable for the immune-inhibitory effects of T. gondii. Unexpectedly, mice with targeted deletion of SOCS3 in macrophages and neutrophils have reduced IL-12 responses and succumb to toxoplasmosis. Anti-IL-6 administration or IL-12 treatment blocked disease susceptibility, suggesting that in the absence of SOCS3, macrophages are hypersensitive to the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-6. Thus, SOCS3 has a critical role in suppressing IL-6 signals and promoting immune responses to control T. gondii infection.

Abstract: Summary
Semen serves as a vehicle for HIV and promotes sexual transmission of the virus, which accounts for the majority of new HIV cases. The major component of semen is the coagulum, a viscous structure composed predominantly of spermatozoa and semenogelin proteins. Due to the activity of the semen protease PSA, the coagulum is liquefied and semenogelins are cleaved into smaller fragments. Here, we report that a subset of these semenogelin fragments form amyloid fibrils that greatly enhance HIV infection. Like SEVI, another amyloid fibril previously identified in semen, the semenogelin fibrils exhibit a cationic surface and enhance HIV virion attachment and entry. Whereas semen samples from healthy individuals greatly enhance HIV infection, semenogelin-deficient semen samples from patients with ejaculatory duct obstruction are completely deficient in enhancing activity. Semen thus harbors distinct amyloidogenic peptides derived from different precursor proteins that commonly enhance HIV infection and likely contribute to HIV transmission.

Abstract: Summary
Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery in humans, invades epithelial cells, using a type III secretory system (T3SS) to inject bacterial effectors into host cells and remodel the actin cytoskeleton. ATP released through connexin hemichanels on the epithelial membrane stimulates Shigella invasion and dissemination in epithelial cells. Here, we show that prior to contact with the cell body, Shigella is captured by nanometer-thin micropodial extensions (NMEs) at a distance from the cell surface, in a process involving the T3SS tip complex proteins and stimulated by ATP- and connexin-mediated signaling. Upon bacterial contact, NMEs retract, bringing bacteria in contact with the cell body, where invasion occurs. ATP stimulates Erk1/2 activation, which controls actin retrograde flow in NMEs and their retraction. These findings reveal previously unappreciated facets of interaction of an invasive bacterium with host cells and a prominent role for Erk1/2 in the control of filopodial dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolism must be coordinated with development to provide the appropriate energetic needs for each stage in the life cycle. Little is known, however, about how this temporal control is achieved. Here, we show that the Drosophila ortholog of the estrogen-related receptor (ERR) family of nuclear receptors directs a critical metabolic transition during development. dERR mutants die as larvae with low ATP levels and elevated levels of circulating sugars. The expression of active dERR protein in mid-embryogenesis triggers a coordinate switch in gene expression that drives a metabolic program normally associated with proliferating cells, supporting the dramatic growth that occurs during larval development. This study shows that dERR plays a central role in carbohydrate metabolism, demonstrates that a proliferative metabolic program is used in normal developmental growth, and provides a molecular context to understand the close association between mammalian ERR family members and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Adrenergic stimulation of the heart engages cAMP and phosphoinositide second messenger signaling cascades. Cardiac phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110γ participates in these processes by sustaining β-adrenergic receptor internalization through its catalytic function and by controlling phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) activity via an unknown kinase-independent mechanism. We have discovered that p110γ anchors protein kinase A (PKA) through a site in its N-terminal region. Anchored PKA activates PDE3B to enhance cAMP degradation and phosphorylates p110γ to inhibit PIP3 production. This provides local feedback control of PIP3 and cAMP signaling events. In congestive heart failure, p110γ is upregulated and escapes PKA-mediated inhibition, contributing to a reduction in β-adrenergic receptor density. Pharmacological inhibition of p110γ normalizes β-adrenergic receptor density and improves contractility in failing hearts.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with high blood cholesterol. Here, we investigated the effect of cholesterol loading on MIN6 cells derived from pancreatic β cells. Exposure of MIN6 cells to cholesterol-induced apoptosis in time- and dose-dependent manner. Treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin that removes cholesterol from plasma membrane prevented the cells from cholesterol-induced apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that the levels of phosphorylated-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P-p38 MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (P-JNK) were significantly increased after the cholesterol loading, suggesting that the stress-activated protein kinase signaling was stimulated. A specific p38 inhibitor rescued MIN6 cells from cholesterol-induced apoptosis, while JNK inhibitor failed, suggesting the importance of activation of p38 MAPK signaling in response to cholesterol. The expression of Bip and CHOP, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, remained unaffected, indicating that the ER stress may not be involved in the cytotoxicity of cholesterol on the ΜΙΝ6 cells. The intracellular concentration of reactive oxygen species measured by use of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate was significantly increased after cholesterol loading, demonstrating the induced apoptosis was mediated through oxidative stress. Addition of reduced form of glutathione in the medium rescued MIN6 cells from apoptosis induced by cholesterol loading. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the free cholesterol loading can induce apoptosis of MIN6 cells mediated by oxidative stress and the activation of p38 MAPK signaling.

Abstract: Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, is highly expressed in prostate cancer although the SCD protein has been known to be rapidly turned over by proteolytic cleavage. The present data demonstrate that SCD can promote proliferation of androgen receptor (AR)-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cells and enhance dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced AR transcriptional activity, resulting in increased expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (KLK2). Interestingly, among the previously reported SCD-derived peptides produced by proteolytic cleavage of SCD, a peptide spanning amino acids 130-162 of SCD (SCD-CoRNR) contained the CoRNR box motif (LFLII) and enhanced AR transcriptional activity. In contrast, a mutant SCD-CoRNR in which Leu136 was replaced by Ala had no effect on AR transcriptional activity. Moreover, SCD-CoRNR directly interacted with AR and inhibited RIP140 suppression of AR transactivation. Knockdown of the SCD gene by SCD microRNA suppressed AR transactivation with decreased cell proliferation, suggesting that SCD may regulate the proliferation of LNCaP cells via modulation of AR transcriptional activity. Moreover, ectopic expression of SCD in LNCaP cells facilitated LNCaP tumor formation and growth in nude mice. Together, the data indicate that SCD plays a key role in the regulation of AR transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells.

Abstract: Stress can be defined as physical and psychological modifications that disrupt the homeostasis and the balance of organisms. Stress is known as one of the most important reasons of several diseases. In the present study, the anti-stress effect of betaine was evaluated with reference to its antioxidant property. Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups such as control, betaine, restraint stress (6 h/day for 30 days), and betaine + restraint stress. The oxidative damage was assessed by measuring the protein and corticosterone in plasma, lipid peroxidation, non-enzymic (reduced glutathione), and enzymic antioxidants (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase) in the lymphoid organs of thymus and spleen. Followed by the induction of restraint stress, the non-enzymic and enzymic antioxidants were significantly decreased with concomitant increase observed in the levels of corticosterone and lipid peroxidation. Oral pretreatment with betaine (250 mg/kg body weight daily for a period of 30 days) significantly (P < 0.001) prevented the restraint stress-induced alterations in the levels of protein and corticosterone in plasma of experimental groups of rats. It counteracted the restraint stress-induced lipid peroxidation and maintained the antioxidant defense system in the lymphoid tissues at near normal. The findings suggest that betaine possesses significant anti-stress activity, which may be due to its antioxidant property.

Abstract: Summary
In Huntington's disease (HD), the mutant huntingtin protein is ubiquitously expressed. The disease was considered to be limited to the basal ganglia, but recent studies have suggested a more widespread pathology involving hypothalamic dysfunction. Here we tested the hypothesis that expression of mutant huntingtin in the hypothalamus causes metabolic abnormalities. First, we showed that bacterial artificial chromosome-mediated transgenic HD (BACHD) mice developed impaired glucose metabolism and pronounced insulin and leptin resistance. Selective hypothalamic expression of a short fragment of mutant huntingtin using adeno-associated viral vectors was sufficient to recapitulate these metabolic disturbances. Finally, selective hypothalamic inactivation of the mutant gene prevented the development of the metabolic phenotype in BACHD mice. Our findings establish a causal link between mutant huntingtin expression in the hypothalamus and metabolic dysfunction, and indicate that metabolic parameters are powerful readouts to assess therapies aimed at correcting dysfunction in HD by silencing huntingtin expression in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Despite evidence supporting an oncogenic role in breast cancer, the Notch pathway's contribution to metastasis remains unknown. Here, we report that the Notch ligand Jagged1 is a clinically and functionally important mediator of bone metastasis by activating the Notch pathway in bone cells. Jagged1 promotes tumor growth by stimulating IL-6 release from osteoblasts and directly activates osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, Jagged1 is a potent downstream mediator of the bone metastasis cytokine TGFβ that is released during bone destruction. Importantly, γ-secretase inhibitor treatment reduces Jagged1-mediated bone metastasis by disrupting the Notch pathway in stromal bone cells. These findings elucidate a stroma-dependent mechanism for Notch signaling in breast cancer and provide rationale for using γ-secretase inhibitors for the treatment of bone metastasis.

Epidermal growth factor receptor reactivation induced by E-prostanoid-3 receptor- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme-dependent feedback exaggerates interleukin-8 production in airway cancer (NCI-H292) cells,

Abstract: Airway epithelial cancer cells produce increased amounts of the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8), inducing pro-tumor responses. Multiple stimuli induce airway epithelial IL-8 production epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dependently, but the mechanisms that exaggerate IL-8 production in airway cancers remain unknown. Here we show that direct activation of EGFR (EGFR-P) by its ligand transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha induces a second EGFR-P in human airway (NCI-H292) cancer cells but not in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, exaggerating IL-8 production in these cancer cells. The second EGFR-P in NCI-H292 cells was caused by metalloprotease TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE)-dependent cleavage of EGFR pro-ligands and was responsible for most of the total IL-8 induced by TGF-alpha. In NCI-H292 cells, TGF-alpha induced cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-dependent prostaglandin (PG)E2 production and release. PGE2 increased the second EGFR-P and IL-8 production via binding to its Gi-protein-coupled E-prostanoid (EP)3 receptor. In NHBE cells, TGF-alpha-induced EGFR-P did not lead to PGE2 production or to a second EGFR-P, and less IL-8 was produced. Thus, we conclude that a positive feedback pathway involving COX-2/PGE2/EP3 receptor-dependent EGFR reactivation exaggerates IL-8 production in NCI-H292 cancer cells but not in NHBE (normal) cells.

Abstract: Summary
Perturbations of the composition of the symbiotic intestinal microbiota can have profound consequences for host metabolism and immunity. In mice, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) direct the accumulation of potentially proinflammatory Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria. We present the genome sequence of SFB isolated from monocolonized mice, which classifies SFB phylogenetically as a unique member of Clostridiales with a highly reduced genome. Annotation analysis demonstrates that SFB depend on their environment for amino acids and essential nutrients and may utilize host and dietary glycans for carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Comparative analyses reveal that SFB are functionally related to members of the genus Clostridium and several pathogenic or commensal “minimal” genera, including Finegoldia, Mycoplasma, Borrelia, and Phytoplasma. However, SFB are functionally distinct from all 1200 examined genomes, indicating a gene complement representing biology relatively unique to their role as a gut commensal closely tied to host metabolism and immunity.

Abstract: Defects in subunits of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex represent a growing subset of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). In addition to altered protein glycosylation and vesicular trafficking, Cog-deficient patient fibroblasts exhibit a striking delay in the Golgi-disrupting effects of brefeldin A (BFA). Despite the diagnostic value of this BFA resistance, the molecular basis of this response is not known. To investigate potential mechanisms of resistance, we analyzed the localization of the large ARF-GEF, GBF1, in several Cog-deficient cell lines. Our results revealed mislocalization of GBF1 to non-Golgi compartments, in particular the ERGIC, within these cells. Biochemical analysis of GBF1 in control and BFA-treated fibroblasts demonstrated that the steady-state level and membrane recruitment is not substantially affected by COG deficiency, supporting a role for the COG complex in the localization but not membrane association of GBF1. We also showed that pretreatment of fibroblasts with bafilomycin resulted in a GBF1-independent BFA resistance that appears additive with the resistance associated with COG deficiency. These data provide new insight into the mechanism of BFA resistance in Cog-deficient cells by suggesting a role for impaired ARF-GEF localization.

Abstract: Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor is a central unit in intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Regulation of the IP3 receptor by calcium is well characterized. High open probability values are reported for a single IP3 receptor in nuclear patch clamp experiments. These experimental observations are in contrast with the lower open probability values of the lipid bilayer experiments. Most theoretical models do not account for high open probabilities of the receptor. But more recently, new models of the IP3 receptor have been put forward which are constrained by single-channel nuclear patch clamp recordings, which generate the larger open probability with the aid of an additional agonist-independent conformational transformation (AICT)—‘active’ state. The main aim of this work is to constrain the AICT models with a wealth of experimental data characterizing calcium release from IP3 receptor clusters. Our results suggest that consistency of cluster release between theory and experiments constrains the kinetics of the agonist-independent conformational transition rates (AICT) to values which lead to small open probabilities for the IP3 receptor inconsistent with nuclear patch clamp experimental data.

Abstract: MARVEL domain-containing 1 (MARVELD1) is a newly identified nuclear protein; however its function has not been clear until now. Here, we report that mouse MARVELD1 (mMARVELD1), which is highly conserved between mice and humans, exhibits cell cycle-dependent cellular localization. In NIH3T3 cells, MARVELD1 was observed in the nucleus and at the perinuclear region during interphase, but was localized at the mitotic spindle and midbody at metaphase, and a significant fraction of mMARVELD1 translocated to the plasma membrane during anaphase. In addition, treatment of cells with colchicine, a microtubuledepolymerizing agent, resulted in translocation of mMARVELD1 to the plasma membrane, and association of mMARVELD1 and α-tubulin was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Finally, overexpression of mMARVELD1 resulted in a remarkable inhibition of cell proliferation, G1-phase arrest, and reduced cell migration. These findings indicate that mMARVELD1 is a microtubule-associated protein that plays an important role in cell cycle progression and migration.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, tenofovir, was recently formulated into a vaginal gel for use as a microbicide. In human trials, a 1% tenofovir gel inhibited HIV sexual transmission by 39% and, surprisingly, herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) transmission by 51%. We demonstrate that the concentration achieved intravaginally with a 1% tenofovir topical gel has direct antiherpetic activity. Tenofovir inhibits the replication of HSV clinical isolates in human embryonic fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and organotypic epithelial 3D rafts, decreases HSV replication in human lymphoid and cervicovaginal tissues ex vivo, and delays HSV-induced lesions and death in topically treated HSV-infected mice. The active tenofovir metabolite inhibits HSV DNA-polymerase and HIV reverse-transcriptase. To exert dual antiviral effects, tenofovir requires topical administration to achieve a drug concentration higher than systemic levels achieved by oral treatment. These findings indicate that a single topical treatment, like tenofovir, can inhibit the transmission of HIV and its copathogens.

Endoplasmic reticulum stress or mutation of an EF-hand Ca2+-binding domain directs the FKBP65 rotamase to an ERAD-based proteolysis,

Abstract: FKBP65 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized chaperone and rotamase, with cargo proteins that include tropoelastin and collagen. In humans, mutations in FKBP65 have recently been shown to cause a form of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a brittle bone disease resulting from deficient secretion of mature type I collagen. In this work, we describe the rapid proteolysis of FKBP65 in response to ER stress signals that activate the release of ER Ca2+ stores. A large-scale screen for stress-induced cellular changes revealed FKBP65 proteins to decrease within 6–12 h of stress activation. Inhibiting IP3R-mediated ER Ca2+ release blocked this response. No other ER-localized chaperone and folding mediators assessed in the study displayed this phenomenon, indicating that this rapid proteolysis of folding mediator is distinctive. Imaging and cellular fractionation confirmed the localization of FKBP65 (72 kDa glycoprotein) to the ER of untreated cells, a rapid decrease in protein levels following ER stress, and the corresponding appearance of a 30-kDa fragment in the cytosol. Inhibition of the proteasome during ER stress revealed an accumulation of FKBP65 in the cytosol, consistent with retrotranslocation and a proteasome-based proteolysis. To assess the role of Ca2+-binding EF-hand domains in FKBP65 stability, a recombinant FKBP65-GFP construct was engineered to ablate Ca2+ binding at each of two EF-hand domains. Cells transfected with the wild-type construct displayed ER localization of the FKBP65-GFP protein and a proteasome-dependent proteolysis in response to ER stress. Recombinant FKBP65-GFP carrying a defect in the EF1 Ca2+-binding domain displayed diminished protein in the ER when compared to wild-type FKBP65-GFP. Proteasome inhibition restored mutant protein to levels similar to that of the wild-type FKBP65-GFP. A similar mutation in EF2 did not confer FKBP65 proteolysis. This work supports a model in which stress-induced changes in ER Ca2+ stores induce the rapid proteolysis of FKBP65, a chaperone and folding mediator of collagen and tropoelastin. The destruction of this protein may identify a cellular strategy for replacement of protein folding machinery following ER stress. The implications for stress-induced changes in the handling of aggregate-prone proteins in the ER–Golgi secretory pathway are discussed. This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R15GM065139) and the National Science Foundation (DBI-0452587).

Abstract: Rosiglitazone, one of the thiazolidinedione (TZD), is an oral antidiabetic drug that activates a gamma isoform of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ). To identify target proteins induced by rosiglitazone in adipocytes, we first performed simultaneous in-depth proteomic profiling of cytosolic proteins and secreted proteins (secretome) from 3T3-L1 adipocytes using a label-free quantification method with nano-UPLC MS/MS. In total, we identified 646 proteins from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, of which 172 and 162 proteins were upregulated and downregulated >1.5-fold, respectively, in rosiglitazone-treated cells, as compared to controls. Some differentially expressed proteins in particular, including fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, fatty acid binding protein, lipoprotein lipase, acetyl CoA acyltransferase, carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2, sterol carrier protein, adiponectin, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase could explain the current action mechanism of TZDs. Furthermore, this study is the first to report on two potential target proteins of rosiglitazone, such as adenomatosis polyposis coli 2 (APC2), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A-1 (eIF5A) related to apoptosis and cell division. Our data clearly suggest that in-depth proteomic approaches using cytosolic and secreted proteins are important and necessary for identification of drug targets at the protein level.

U1 snRNA Directly Interacts with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein during Splicing Repression,

Abstract: Summary
Splicing of the c-src N1 exon is repressed by the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB or PTBP1). During exon repression, the U1 snRNP binds properly to the N1 exon 5′ splice site but is made inactive by the presence of PTB. Examining the patterns of nuclease protection at this 5′ splice site, we find that the interaction of U1 is altered by the adjacent PTB. Interestingly, UV crosslinking identifies a direct contact between the pre-mRNA-bound PTB and the U1 snRNA. EMSA, ITC, and NMR studies show that PTB RRMs 1 and 2 bind the pyrimidine-rich internal loop of U1 snRNA stem loop 4. The PTB/U1 interaction prevents further assembly of the U1 snRNP with spliceosomal components downstream. This precise interaction between a splicing regulator and an snRNA component of the spliceosome points to a range of different mechanisms for splicing regulation.

Abstract: Sperm bundles of the ephemeropteran Cloeon dipterum (L.) were found in the seminal vesicle. They are apically protected by cyst cells and sperm anterior regions are embedded in a secretion produced by these cells. Cyst cells further degenerate making sperm cells free. The sperm bundles are able to perform a forward progression only when sperm are stick together with their tail posterior tips. On the contrary, when sperm have their tail ends free, they beat but are unable to progress. The functional significance of the sperm bundles is discussed.

Abstract: Summary
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is central to mitochondrial oxidative damage and redox signaling, but its roles are poorly understood due to the difficulty of measuring mitochondrial H2O2 in vivo. Here we report a ratiometric mass spectrometry probe approach to assess mitochondrial matrix H2O2 levels in vivo. The probe, MitoB, comprises a triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation driving its accumulation within mitochondria, conjugated to an arylboronic acid that reacts with H2O2 to form a phenol, MitoP. Quantifying the MitoP/MitoB ratio by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry enabled measurement of a weighted average of mitochondrial H2O2 that predominantly reports on thoracic muscle mitochondria within living flies. There was an increase in mitochondrial H2O2 with age in flies, which was not coordinately altered by interventions that modulated life span. Our findings provide approaches to investigate mitochondrial ROS in vivo and suggest that while an increase in overall mitochondrial H2O2 correlates with aging, it may not be causative.

Abstract: Summary
Metastasis is responsible for most cancer deaths. Here, we show that Aes (or Grg5) gene functions as an endogenous metastasis suppressor. Expression of Aes was decreased in liver metastases compared with primary colon tumors in both mice and humans. Aes inhibited Notch signaling by converting active Rbpj transcription complexes into repression complexes on insoluble nuclear matrix. In tumor cells, Notch signaling was triggered by ligands on adjoining blood vessels, and stimulated transendothelial migration. Genetic depletion of Aes in ApcΔ716 intestinal polyposis mice caused marked tumor invasion and intravasation that were suppressed by Notch signaling inhibition. These results suggest that inhibition of Notch signaling can be a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of colon cancer metastasis.

Abstract: Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are glial cells in the olfactory system with morphological and functional plasticity. Cultured OECs have the flattened and process-bearing shape. Reversible changes have been found between these two morphological phenotypes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of their morphological plasticity remains elusive. Using RhoA FRET biosensor, we found that the active RhoA signal mainly distributed in the lamellipodia and/or filopodia of OECs. Local disruption of these active RhoA distributions led to the morphological change from the flattened into process-bearing shape and promoted process outgrowth. Furthermore, RhoA pathway inhibitors, Toxin-B, C3, Y-27632 or over-expression of DN-RhoA blocked serum-induced morphological change of OECs from the process-bearing into flattened shape, whereas the activation of RhoA pathway by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) promoted the morphological change from the process-bearing into flattened shape. Finally, ROCK–Myosin–F-actin as a downstream of RhoA pathway was involved in morphological plasticity of OECs. Taken together, these results suggest that RhoA–ROCK–Myosin pathway mediates the morphological plasticity of cultured OECs in response to extracellular cues.

Abstract: Summary
A cycle of palmitoylation/depalmitoylation of H-Ras mediates bidirectional trafficking between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane, but nothing is known about how this cycle is regulated. We show that the prolyl isomerase (PI) FKBP12 binds to H-Ras in a palmitoylation-dependent fashion and promotes depalmitoylation. A variety of inhibitors of the PI activity of FKBP12, including FK506, rapamycin, and cycloheximide, increase steady-state palmitoylation. FK506 inhibits retrograde trafficking of H-Ras from the plasma membrane to the Golgi in a proline 179-dependent fashion, augments early GTP loading of Ras in response to growth factors, and promotes H-Ras-dependent neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells. These data demonstrate that FKBP12 regulates H-Ras trafficking by promoting depalmitoylation through cis-trans isomerization of a peptidyl-prolyl bond in proximity to the palmitoylated cysteines.

Abstract: Summary
Porphyromonas gingivalis is a low-abundance oral anaerobic bacterium implicated in periodontitis, a polymicrobial inflammatory disease, and the associated systemic conditions. However, the mechanism by which P. gingivalis contributes to inflammation and disease has remained elusive. Here we show that P. gingivalis, at very low colonization levels, triggers changes to the amount and composition of the oral commensal microbiota leading to inflammatory periodontal bone loss. The commensal microbiota and complement were both required for P. gingivalis-induced bone loss, as germ-free mice or conventionally raised C3a and C5a receptor-deficient mice did not develop bone loss after inoculation with P. gingivalis. These findings demonstrate that a single, low-abundance species can disrupt host-microbial homeostasis to cause inflammatory disease. The identification and targeting of similar low-abundance pathogens with community-wide impact may be important for treating inflammatory diseases of polymicrobial etiology.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii are obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasites that rapidly invade and extensively modify host cells. Protein phosphorylation is one mechanism by which these parasites can control such processes. Here we present a phosphoproteome analysis of peptides enriched from schizont stage P. falciparum and T. gondii tachyzoites that are either “intracellular” or purified away from host material. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we identified over 5,000 and 10,000 previously unknown phosphorylation sites in P. falciparum and T. gondii, respectively, revealing that protein phosphorylation is an extensively used regulation mechanism both within and beyond parasite boundaries. Unexpectedly, both parasites have phosphorylated tyrosines, and P. falciparum has unusual phosphorylation motifs that are apparently shaped by its A:T-rich genome. This data set provides important information on the role of phosphorylation in the host-pathogen interaction and clues to the evolutionary forces operating on protein phosphorylation motifs in both parasites.

Abstract: Summary
RhoA-inhibitory bacterial toxins, such as Staphylococcus aureus EDIN toxin, induce large transendothelial cell macroaperture (TEM) tunnels that rupture the host endothelium barrier and promote bacterial dissemination. Host cells repair these tunnels by extending actin-rich membrane waves from the TEM edges. We reveal that cyclic-AMP signaling produced by Bacillus anthracis edema toxin (ET) also induces TEM formation, which correlates with increased vascular permeability. We show that ET-induced TEM formation resembles liquid dewetting, a physical process of nucleation and growth of holes within a thin liquid film. We also identify the cellular mechanisms of tunnel closure and reveal that the I-BAR domain protein Missing in Metastasis (MIM) senses de novo membrane curvature generated by the TEM, accumulates at the TEM edge, and triggers Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization, which induces actin-rich membrane waves that close the TEM. Thus, the balance between ET-induced TEM formation and resealing likely determines the integrity of the host endothelium barrier.

Abstract: Korean salamanders of the genus Hynobius are currently classified into 3 species, H. leechii, H. quelpaertensis, and H. yangi. To investigate the phylogenetic relationship of these species, we analyzed the partial sequence of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (907 bp) of 197 specimens from 43 regions in South Korea. Of these specimens, 93 were additionally examined with 12S rRNA (799 bp). Based on the partial sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and 12S rRNA, 89 and 36 haplotypes were defined, respectively, consisting of six subclades (H. leechii, H. quelpaertensis, H. yangi, HC1, HC2, and HC3). Among these subclades, the three subclades (HC1, HC2, and HC3) were clearly separated from the 3 previously reported species in the genus Hynobius. Pairwise sequence divergence between the six subclades ranged from 6.3 to 11.2% in cytochrome b gene and 2.0 to 4.3% in 12S rRNA. These results indicate there may be more divergent populations than the three currently described. Moreover, the estimation of divergence time revealed that the Hynobius species in South Korea diverged during the Miocene epoch, approximately 9 - 5 MYA. In addition, we confirmed the distribution of the three known species (H. leechii, H. quelpaertensis, and H. yangi) and determined the distributions of new, distinct groups (or subclades; HC1, HC1, and HC3). To more accurately establish the taxonomic status and population structure, further genetic, morphological, and ecological studies will be needed.

Abstract: A spontaneously restored sinus rhythm in permanent atrial fibrillation patients has been often observed after mitral valve (MV) surgery, but persisting duration in sinus rhythm varies from patient to patient. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) may be involved in pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. We hypothesized that stabilization of restored sinus rhythm is associated with expression of Hsps in the atria. To test this hypothesis, clinical data, biopsies of right atrial appendage, and blood samples were collected from 135 atrial fibrillation patients who spontaneously restored sinus rhythm after conventional isolated MV replacement. Comparison was made between patients who had recurrence of atrial fibrillation within 7 days (AF) vs. patients with persisted sinus rhythm for more than 7 days (SR). Results showed that SR patients had higher activity of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) as well as upregulated expressions of heat shock cognate 70, Hsp70, and Hsp27 in the tissues. The activation of HSF1–Hsps pathway was associated with less-aggressive pathogenesis as reflected by lower rates of myolysis, apoptosis, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation in SR patients. However, Hsp60 was lower in both tissue and plasma in SR patients, and was positively correlated with apoptosis, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation. These findings suggest that the Hsps play important roles in stabilization of restored sinus rhythm after MV surgery by inhibiting AF-related atrial remodeling and arrhythmogenic substrates in atrial fibrillation patients. Low circulating Hsp60 levels preoperatively might predict a stable spontaneously restored sinus rhythm postoperatively.

Foxp3+ Regulatory T Cell Expansion Required for Sustaining Pregnancy Compromises Host Defense against Prenatal Bacterial Pathogens,

Abstract: Summary
Although pregnancy confers unique susceptibility to infection, the pregnancy-associated immune defects that erode host defense remain largely undefined. Herein, we demonstrate that expansion of immune-suppressive Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) which occurs physiologically during pregnancy or when experimentally induced in transgenic mice caused enhanced susceptibility to prenatal pathogens including Listeria and Salmonella species. Reciprocally, infection susceptibility was uniformly reduced with Treg ablation. Importantly however, the sustained expansion of maternal Tregs was essential for maintaining immune tolerance to the developing fetus because even partial transient ablation of Foxp3-expressing cells fractured maternal tolerance to fetal antigen and triggered fetal resorption. Interestingly, Foxp3 cell-intrinsic defects in the immune-suppressive cytokine IL-10 alone were sufficient to override Treg-mediated infection susceptibility, while IL-10 was nonessential for sustaining pregnancy. Thus, maternal Treg expansion required for sustaining pregnancy creates naturally occurring holes in host defense that confer prenatal infection susceptibility.

Abstract: Summary
Resistance to fungal infections is attributed to engagement of host pattern-recognition receptors, notably the β-glucan receptor Dectin-1 and the integrin Mac-1, which induce phagocytosis and antifungal immunity. However, the mechanisms by which these receptors coordinate fungal clearance are unknown. We show that upon ligand binding, Dectin-1 activates Mac-1 to also recognize fungal components, and this stepwise process is critical for neutrophil cytotoxic responses. Both Mac-1 activation and Dectin-1- and Mac-1-induced neutrophil effector functions require Vav1 and Vav3, exchange factors for RhoGTPases. Mac-1- or Vav1,3-deficient mice have increased susceptibility to systemic candidiasis that is not due to impaired neutrophil recruitment but defective intracellular killing of C. albicans yeast forms, and Mac-1 or Vav1,3 reconstitution in hematopoietic cells restores resistance. Our results demonstrate that antifungal immunity depends on Dectin-1-induced activation of Mac-1 functions that is coordinated by Vav proteins, a pathway that may localize cytotoxic responses of circulating neutrophils to infected tissues.

Abstract: Human lens membranes contain the highest cholesterol concentration of any known biological membranes, but it significantly decreases with age. Oxygenation of cholesterol generates numerous forms of oxysterols (bile acids). We previously showed that two forms of the bile acid components—ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA)—suppressed lens epithelial cell death and alleviated cataract formation in galactosemic rat lenses. We investigated whether these compounds also suppress the thermal aggregation of human lens crystallins. Total water-soluble (WS) proteins were prepared from human lenses, and recombinant human crystallins (αA-, αB-, βB2-, and γC-crystallin) were generated by a prokaryotic expression system and purified by liquid chromatography. The light scattering of proteins in the presence or absence of UDCA or TUDCA was measured using a spectrofluorometer set at Ex/Em = 400/400 nm. Protein blot analysis was conducted for detection of α-crystallins in the human lens WS proteins. High concentrations of UDCA and TUDCA significantly suppressed thermal aggregation of total lens WS proteins, which contained a low level of αA-/αB-crystallin. Spectroscopic analysis with each recombinant human lens crystallin indicated that the bile acids did not suppress the thermal aggregation of γC-, βB2-, αA-, or αB-crystallin. Combination of α-crystallin and bile acid (either UDCA or TUDCA) suppressed thermal aggregation of each individual crystallin as well as a non-crystallin protein, insulin. These results suggest that UDCA or TUDCA protects the chaperone activity of α-crystallin. It is believed that these two naturally occurring intermediate waste products in the lens enhance the chaperone activity of α-crystallin. This finding may lead to the development of UDCA and TUDCA as anticataract agents.

Abstract: Summary
AMPK has emerged as a critical mechanism for salutary effects of polyphenols on lipid metabolic disorders in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Here we demonstrate that AMPK interacts with and directly phosphorylates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1c and -2). Ser372 phosphorylation of SREBP-1c by AMPK is necessary for inhibition of proteolytic processing and transcriptional activity of SREBP-1c in response to polyphenols and metformin. AMPK stimulates Ser372 phosphorylation, suppresses SREBP-1c cleavage and nuclear translocation, and represses SREBP-1c target gene expression in hepatocytes exposed to high glucose, leading to reduced lipogenesis and lipid accumulation. Hepatic activation of AMPK by the synthetic polyphenol S17834 protects against hepatic steatosis, hyperlipidemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis in diet-induced insulin-resistant LDL receptor-deficient mice in part through phosphorylation of SREBP-1c Ser372 and suppression of SREBP-1c- and -2-dependent lipogenesis. AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of SREBP may offer therapeutic strategies to combat insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
The JAK2V617F constitutively activated tyrosine kinase is found in most patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. While examining the interaction between JAK2 and PRMT5, an arginine methyltransferase originally identified as JAK-binding protein 1, we found that JAK2V617F (and JAK2K539L) bound PRMT5 more strongly than did wild-type JAK2. These oncogenic kinases also acquired the ability to phosphorylate PRMT5, greatly impairing its ability to methylate its histone substrates, and representing a specific gain-of-function that allows them to regulate chromatin modifications. We readily detected PRMT5 phosphorylation in JAK2V617F-positive patient samples, and when we knocked down PRMT5 in human CD34+ cells using shRNA, we observed increased colony formation and erythroid differentiation. These results indicate that phosphorylation of PRMT5 contributes to the mutant JAK2-induced myeloproliferative phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous studies of amyloid assembly have indicated that partially folded protein species are responsible for initiating aggregation. Despite their importance, the structural and dynamic features of amyloidogenic intermediates and the molecular details of how they cause aggregation remain elusive. Here, we use ΔN6, a truncation variant of the naturally amyloidogenic protein β2-microglobulin (β2m), to determine the solution structure of a nonnative amyloidogenic intermediate at high resolution. The structure of ΔN6 reveals a major repacking of the hydrophobic core to accommodate the nonnative peptidyl-prolyl trans-isomer at Pro32. These structural changes, together with a concomitant pH-dependent enhancement in backbone dynamics on a microsecond-millisecond timescale, give rise to a rare conformer with increased amyloidogenic potential. We further reveal that catalytic amounts of ΔN6 are competent to convert nonamyloidogenic human wild-type β2m (Hβ2m) into a rare amyloidogenic conformation and provide structural evidence for the mechanism by which this conformational conversion occurs.

Abstract: The atrioventricular node (AVN) can act as a subsidiary cardiac pacemaker if the sinoatrial node fails. In this study, we investigated the effects of the Na–Ca exchange (NCX) inhibitor KB-R7943, and inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), using thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), on spontaneous action potentials (APs) and [Ca2+]i transients from cells isolated from the rabbit AVN. Spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients were monitored from undialysed AVN cells at 37°C using Fluo-4. In separate experiments, spontaneous APs and ionic currents were recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Rapid application of 5μM KB-R7943 slowed or stopped spontaneous APs and [Ca2+]i transients. However, in voltage clamp experiments in addition to blocking NCX current (INCX) KB-R7943 partially inhibited L-type calcium current (ICa,L). Rapid reduction of external [Na+] also abolished spontaneous activity. Inhibition of SERCA (using 2.5μM thapsigargin or 30μM CPA) also slowed or stopped spontaneous APs and [Ca2+]i transients. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release influences spontaneous activity in AVN cells, and that this occurs via [Ca2+]i-activated INCX; however, the inhibitory action of KB-R7943 on ICa,L means that care is required in the interpretation of data obtained using this compound.

Abstract: Summary
The aberrant accumulation of lipids in the liver (“fatty liver”) is tightly associated with several components of the metabolic syndrome, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and atherosclerosis. Here we show that the impaired hepatic expression of transcriptional cofactor transducin beta-like (TBL) 1 represents a common feature of mono- and multigenic fatty liver mouse models. Indeed, the liver-specific ablation of TBL1 gene expression in healthy mice promoted hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis under both normal and high-fat dietary conditions. TBL1 deficiency resulted in inhibition of fatty acid oxidation due to impaired functional cooperation with its heterodimerization partner TBL-related (TBLR) 1 and the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α. As TBL1 expression levels were found to also inversely correlate with liver fat content in human patients, the lack of hepatic TBL1/TBLR1 cofactor activity may represent a molecular rationale for hepatic steatosis in subjects with obesity and the metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: Even though the erythroleukemia cell lines K562 and HEL do not express α1-adrenoceptors, some α1-adrenergic drugs influence both survival and differentiation of these cell lines. Since Ca2+ is closely related to cellular homeostasis, we examined the capacity of α1-adrenergic drugs to modulate the intracellular Ca2+ content in K562 cells. Because of morphological alterations of mitochondria following α1-adrenergic agonist treatment, we also scrutinized mitochondrial functions. In order to visualize the non-adrenoceptor binding site(s) of α1-adrenergic drugs in erythroleukemia cells, we evaluated the application of the fluorescent α1-adrenergic antagonist BODIPY® FL-Prazosin. We discovered that the α1-adrenergic agonists naphazoline, oxymetazoline and also the α1-adrenergic antagonist benoxathian are able to raise the intracellular Ca2+-content in K562 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that naphazoline treatment induces ROS-formation as well as an increase in Δψm in K562 cells. Using BODIPY® FL-Prazosin we were able to visualize the non-adrenoceptor binding site(s) of α1-adrenergic drugs in erythroleukemia cells. Interestingly, the SERCA-inhibitor thapsigargin appears to interfere with the binding of BODIPY® FL-Prazosin. Our data suggest that the effects of α1-adrenergic drugs on erythroleukemia cells are mediated by a thapsigargin sensitive binding site, which controls the fate of erythroleukemia cells towards differentiation, senescence and cell death through modulation of intracellular Ca2+.

Abstract: Summary
Many microbial pathogens, including the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, vary surface protein expression to evade host immune responses. P. falciparium antigenic variation is linked to var gene family-encoded clonally variant surface protein expression. Mututally exclusive var gene expression is partially controlled by spatial positioning; silent genes are retained at distinct perinuclear sites and relocated to transcriptionally active locations for monoallelic expression. We show that var introns can control this process and that var intron addition relocalizes episomes from a random to a perinuclear position. This var intron-regulated nuclear tethering and repositioning is linked to an 18 bp nuclear protein-binding element that recruits an actin protein complex. Pharmacologically induced F-actin formation, which is restricted to the nuclear periphery, repositions intron-carrying episomes and var genes and disrupts mutually exclusive var gene expression. Thus, actin polymerization relocates var genes from a repressive to an active perinuclear compartment, which is crucial for P. falciparium phenotypic variation and pathogenesis.

Abstract: The crucial role of T lymphocytes in anti-tumor immunity has led to the development of novel strategies that can target and activate T cells against tumor cells. Recombinant DNA technology has been used to generate non-MHC-restricted chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Here, we constructed a panel of recombinant CAR that harbors the anti-MUC1 nanobody and the signaling and co-signaling moieties (CD3ζ/CD28) with different spacer regions derived from human IgG3 with one or two repeats of the hinge sequence or the hinge region of FcγRII. The PhiC31 integrase system was employed to investigate if the recombination efficiency could be recruited for high and stable expression of T cell chimeric receptor genes. The effect of nuclear localization signal (NLS) and two different promoters (CMV and CAG) on efficacy of PhiC31 integrase in human T cell lines was evaluated. The presence of integrase in combination with NLS, mediated up to 7.6 and 8.5 fold increases in CAR expression in ZCHN-attB and ZCHHN-attB cassette integrated T cells, respectively. Our results showed that highly efficient and stable transduction of the Jurkat cell line by PhiC31 integrase is a feasible modality for generating anti-cancer chimeric T cells for use in cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Upon detection of viral RNA, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) undergoes TRIM25-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination, leading to type I interferon (IFN) production. In this study, we demonstrate that the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), comprised of two RING-IBR-RING (RBR)-containing E3 ligases, HOIL-1L and HOIP, independently targets TRIM25 and RIG-I to effectively suppress virus-induced IFN production. RBR E3 ligase domains of HOIL-1L and HOIP bind and induce proteasomal degradation of TRIM25, whereas the NZF domain of HOIL-1L competes with TRIM25 for RIG-I binding. Consequently, both actions by the HOIL-1L/HOIP LUBAC potently inhibit RIG-I ubiquitination and antiviral activity, but in a mechanistically separate manner. Conversely, the genetic deletion or depletion of HOIL-1L and HOIP robustly enhances virus-induced type I IFN production. Taken together, the HOIL-1L/HOIP LUBAC specifically suppresses RIG-I ubiquitination and activation by inducing TRIM25 degradation and inhibiting TRIM25 interaction with RIG-I, resulting in the comprehensive suppression of the IFN-mediated antiviral signaling pathway.

Abstract: Mating and sexual development have been associated with virulence in various fungal pathogens including Cryptococcus neoformans. This fungus is a significant pathogen of humans because it causes life-threatening cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised people such as AIDS patients. The virulence of C. neoformans is known to be associated with the mating type of the cells (α or a), with the α mating type being predominant among clinical isolates. However, the mechanisms by which mating and sexual development are controlled by environmental conditions and their relationship with virulence require further investigation. Cir1 is a GATA-type transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes required for utilization of essential metals such as iron and copper, and also genes required for major virulence factors including the polysaccharide capsule and melanin. Here we investigated the role of Cir1 in the mating of C. neoformans. Our results demonstrate that mutants lacking CIR1 are defective in mating, and that Cir1 contributes to copper mediated enhancement of sexual filamentation. Furthermore, we found that Cir1 influences the expression of mating pheromone genes suggesting that this protein plays a role in the early phase of sexual development on V8 mating medium.

Abstract: It has been frequently reported that gp96 acts as a strong biologic adjuvant. Some studies have even investigated adjuvant activity of the gp96 C- or N-terminal domain. The controversy surrounding adjuvant activity of gp96 terminal domains prompted us to compare adjuvant activity of gp96 C- or N-terminal domain toward Her2/neu, as DNA vaccine in a Her2/neu-positive breast cancer model. To do so, mice were immunized with DNA vaccine consisting of transmembrane and extracellular domain (TM + ECD) of rat Her2/neu alone or fused to N- or C-terminal domain of gp96. Treatment with Her2/neu fused to N-terminal domain of gp96 resulted in tumor progression, compared to the groups vaccinated with pCT/Her2 or pHer2. Immunological examination revealed that treatment with Her2/neu fused to N-terminal domain of gp96 led to significantly lower survival rates, higher interferon-γ secretion, and induced infiltration of CD4+/CD8+ cells to the tumor site. However, it could not induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, did not decrease regulatory T cell percentage at the tumor site, and eventually led to tumor progression. Our results reveal that gp96 N-terminal domain does not have adjuvant activity toward Her2/neu. It is also proposed that adjuvant activity and the resultant immune response of gp96 terminal domains may be directed by the antigen applied.

Abstract: The changes in the behavior of Aphanius dispar, a cyprinodont fish when exposed to different concentrations of temephos, an organophosphorus pesticide widely used to control mosquito larvae in aquatic habitats are noted. The histopathology of gills exposed to temephos is studied in detail using light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The gill lesions were seen in all exposed concentrations of 1, 5, 10 and 25ppm and the magnitude of the damage increased with the increase in concentrations. The most adverse effects of temephos are the destruction of cartilage and the large-scale cell death. Other effects included the degradation of chloride cells (CCs), desquamation, epithelial lifting, hypertrophy and lamellar fusion. The histological changes of microridges did not follow a consistent pattern in exposed concentrations. However, lamellar curling and collapsing was common in all exposed fish.

Abstract: Seed germination capability of rice is one of the important traits in the production and storage of seeds. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with seed germination capability in various storage periods was identified using two sets of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) which derived from crosses between Milyang 23 and Tong 88-7 (MT-RILs) and between Dasanbyeo and TR22183 (DT-RILs). A total of five and three main additive effects (QTLs) associated with seed germination capability were identified in MT-RILs and DT-RILs, respectively. Among them, six QTLs were identified repeatedly in various seed storage periods designated as qMT-SGC5.1, qMT-SGC7.2, and qMT-SGC9.1 on chromosomes 5, 7, and 9 in MT-RILs, and qDT-SGC2.1, qDT-SGC3.1, and qDT-SGC9.1 on chromosomes 2, 3, and 9 in DT-RILs, respectively. The QTL on chromosome 9 was identified in both RIL populations under all three storage periods, explaining up to 40% of the phenotypic variation. Eight and eighteen pairs additive × additive epistatic effect (epistatic QTL) were identified in MT-RILs and DT-RILs, respectively. In addition, several near isogenic lines (NILs) were developed to confirm six repeatable QTL effects using controlled deterioration test (CDT). The identified QTLs will be further studied to elucidate the mechanisms controlling seed germination capability, which have important implications for long-term seed storage.

Abstract: Spermatic characteristics were studied in 10 species representing several distinct groups within the catfish family Doradidae. Interestingly, different types of spermatogenesis, spermiogenesis and spermatozoa are correlated with intrafamilial groups previously proposed for Doradidae. Semi-cystic spermatogenesis, modified Type III spermiogenesis, and biflagellate sperm appear to be unique within Doradidae to the subfamily Astrodoradinae. Other doradid species have sperm with a single flagellum, cystic spermatogenesis, and spermiogenesis of Type I (Pterodoras granulosus, Rhinodoras dorbignyi), Type I modified (Oxydoras kneri), or Type III (Trachydoras paraguayensis). Doradids have an external mode of fertilization, and share a few spermatic characteristics, such as cystic spermatogenesis, Type I spermiogenesis and uniflagellate sperm, with its sister group Auchenipteridae, a family exhibiting sperm modifications associated with insemination and internal fertilization. Semi-cystic spermatogenesis and biflagellate spermatozoa are also found in Aspredinidae, and corroborate recent proposals that Aspredinidae and Doradoidea (Doradidae+Auchenipteridae) are sister groups and that Astrodoradinae occupies a basal position within Doradidae. The co-occurrence in various catfish families of semi-cystic spermatogenesis and either biflagellate spermatozoa (Aspredinidae, Cetopsidae, Doradidae, Malapturidae, Nematogenyidae) or uniflagellate sperm with two axonemes (Ariidae) reinforces the suggestion that such characteristics are correlated. Semi-cystic spermatogenesis and biflagellate sperm may represent ancestral conditions for Loricarioidei and Siluroidei of Siluriformes as they occur in putatively basal members of each suborder, Nematogenyidae and Cetopsidae, respectively. However, if semi-cystic spermatogenesis and biflagellate sperm are ancestral for Siluriformes, cystic spermatogenesis and uniflagellate sperm have arisen independently in multiple lineages including Diplomystidae, sister group to Siluroidei.

Abstract: Summary
Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are nonpathogenic, nonenveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses in development as gene therapy vectors. AAV internalization was postulated to proceed via a dynamin-dependent endocytic mechanism. Revisiting this, we find that infectious endocytosis of the prototypical AAV, AAV2, is independent of clathrin, caveolin, and dynamin. AAV2 infection is sensitive to EIPA, a fluid-phase uptake inhibitor, but is unaffected by Rac1 mutants or other macropinocytosis inhibitors. In contrast, AAV2 infection requires actin cytoskeleton remodeling and membrane cholesterol and is sensitive to inhibition of Cdc42, Arf1, and GRAF1, factors known to be involved in the formation of clathrin-independent carriers (CLIC). AAV2 virions are internalized in the detergent-resistant GPI-anchored-protein-enriched endosomal compartment (GEEC) and translocated to the Golgi apparatus, similarly to the CLIC/GEEC marker cholera toxin B. Our results indicate that—unlike the viral entry mechanisms described so far—AAV2 uses the pleiomorphic CLIC/GEEC pathway as its major endocytic infection route.

Abstract: Amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers accumulate in the brain tissue of Alzheimer disease patients and are related to disease pathogenesis. The precise mechanisms by which Aβ oligomers cause neurotoxicity remain unknown. We recently reported that Aβ oligomers cause intracellular Ca2+ overload and neuronal death that can be prevented by NMDA receptor antagonists. This study investigated whether Aβ oligomers directly activated NMDA receptors (NMDARs) using NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B receptors that were heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Indeed, Aβ oligomers induced inward non-desensitizing currents that were blocked in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonists memantine, APV, and MK-801. Intriguingly, the amplitude of the responses to Aβ oligomers was greater for NR1/NR2A heteromers than for NR1/NR2B heteromers expressed in oocytes. Consistent with these findings, we observed that the increase in the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ induced by Aβ oligomers in cortical neurons is prevented by AP5, a broad spectrum NMDA receptor antagonist, but slightly attenuated by ifenprodil which blocks receptors with the NR2B subunit. Together, these results indicate that Aβ oligomers directly activate NMDA receptors, particularly those with the NR2A subunit, and further suggest that drugs that attenuate the activity of such receptors may prevent Aβ damage to neurons in Alzheimeŕs disease.

Abstract: Syntrophins are adaptor proteins that link intracellular signaling molecules to the dystrophin based scaffold. In this study, we investigated the function of syntrophins in cell migration, one of the early steps in myogenic differentiation and in regeneration of adult muscle. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulates migration and lamellipodia formation in cultured C2 myoblasts. In the migrating cells, syntrophin concentrated in the rear-lateral region of the cell, opposite of the lamellipodia, instead of being diffusely present throughout the cytoplasm of non-migrating cells. When the expression of α-syntrophin, the major syntrophin isoform of skeletal muscle, was reduced by transfection with the α-syntrophin-specific siRNA, HGF stimulation of lamellipodia formation was prevented. Likewise, migration of myoblasts from α-syntrophin knockout mice could not be stimulated by HGF. However, HGF-induced migration was restored in myoblasts isolated from a transgenic mouse expressing α-syntrophin only in muscle cells. Treatment of C2 myoblasts with inhibitors of PI3-kinase not only reduced the rate of cell migration, but also impaired the accumulation of syntrophins in the rear-lateral region of the migrating cells. Phosphorylation of Akt was reduced in the α-syntrophin siRNA-treated C2 cells. These results suggest that α-syntrophin is required for HGF-induced migration of myoblasts and for proper PI3-kinase/Akt signaling.

Abstract: Adipocyte apoptosis is an important regulator of adipocyte number in fat depots. We have previously shown that an inhibition of protein synthesis sensitizes human adipocytes for apoptosis. In vivo, dramatic changes in the fat cell's protein expression should be anticipated under special conditions such as calorie restriction. Here, we studied the underlying mechanism by which human preadipocytes and adipocytes are sensitized for death receptor induced apoptosis in vitro. The protein synthesis blocker cycloheximide (CHX) sensitized human fat cells for CD95-induced apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. Treatment with CHX differentially changed expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. Most noticeably, FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) expression rapidly decreased during CHX treatment. Reduction of FLIP levels resulted in undetectable amounts of FLIP at the CD95 death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) upon CD95 stimulation, thereby enhancing recruitment and activation at caspase-8. Down-regulation of FLIP by shRNA sensitized preadipocytes for CD95-induced apoptosis. In mice, adipose tissue mRNA levels of Flip were down-regulated upon fasting. In conclusion, we identify FLIP as an important regulator of apoptosis sensitivity in fat cells. Modulating adipocyte homeostasis by apoptosis might provide a new therapeutic concept to get rid of excess adipose tissue, and FLIP might be a possible target molecule.

Abstract: The olfactory epithelium (OE) contains neural precursor cells which can be easily harvested from a minimally invasive nasal biopsy, making them a valuable cell source to study human neural cell lineages in health and disease. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has been implicated in the etiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and also in the regulation of murine neural precursor cell fate in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we examined the impact of decreased GSK-3 activity on the fate of adult human OE neural precursors in vitro. GSK-3 inhibition was achieved using ATP-competitive (6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime and CHIR99021) or substrate-competitive (TAT-eIF2B) inhibitors to eliminate potential confounding effects on cell fate due to off-target kinase inhibition. GSK-3 inhibitors decreased the number of neural precursor cells in OE cell cultures through a reduction in proliferation. Decreased proliferation was not associated with a reduction in cell survival but was accompanied by a reduction in nestin expression and a substantial increase in the expression of the neuronal differentiation markers MAP1B and neurofilament (NF-M) after 10days in culture. Taken together, these results suggest that GSK-3 inhibition promotes the early stages of neuronal differentiation in cultures of adult human neural precursors and provide insights into the mechanisms by which alterations in GSK-3 signaling affect adult human neurogenesis, a cellular process strongly suspected to play a role in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (eRMS) shows the most myodifferentiation among sarcomas, yet the precise cell of origin remains undefined. Using Ptch1, p53 and/or Rb1 conditional mouse models and controlling prenatal or postnatal myogenic cell of origin, we demonstrate that eRMS and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) lie in a continuum, with satellite cells predisposed to giving rise to UPS. Conversely, p53 loss in maturing myoblasts gives rise to eRMS, which have the highest myodifferentiation potential. Regardless of origin, Rb1 loss modifies tumor phenotype to mimic UPS. In human sarcomas that lack pathognomic chromosomal translocations, p53 loss of function is prevalent, whereas Shh or Rb1 alterations likely act primarily as modifiers. Thus, sarcoma phenotype is strongly influenced by cell of origin and mutational profile.

Abstract: Summary
The lengthy course of treatment with currently used antimycobacterial drugs and the resulting emergence of drug-resistant strains have intensified the need for alternative therapies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the etiologic agent of tuberculosis. We show that Mtb and Mycobacterium marinum use ABL and related tyrosine kinases for entry and intracellular survival in macrophages. In mice, the ABL family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib (Gleevec), when administered prophylactically or therapeutically, reduced both the number of granulomatous lesions and bacterial load in infected organs and was also effective against a rifampicin-resistant strain. Further, when coadministered with current first-line drugs, rifampicin or rifabutin, imatinib acted synergistically. These data implicate host tyrosine kinases in entry and intracellular survival of mycobacteria and suggest that imatinib may have therapeutic efficacy against Mtb. Because imatinib targets host, it is less likely to engender resistance compared to conventional antibiotics and may decrease the development of resistance against coadministered drugs.

Abstract: Cytoplasmic inclusions are found in a variety of diseases that are characteristic morphological features of several hepatic, muscular and neurodegenerative disorders. They display a predominantly filamentous ultrastructure that is also observed in malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT). A cellular clone containing an intracytoplasmic body was isolated from hepatocyte cell culture, and in the present study we examined whether this body might be related or not to Mallory-Denk body (MDB), a well characterized intracytoplasmic inclusion, or whether this cellular clone was constituted by malignant rhabdoid tumor cells. The intracytoplasmic body was observed in electron microscopy (EM), confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and several proteins involved in the formation of its structure were identified. Using light microscopy, a spheroid body (SB) described as a single regular-shaped cytoplasmic body was observed in cells. During cytokinesis, the SB was disassembled and reassembled in a way to reconstitute a unique SB in each progeny cell. EM examination revealed that the SB was not surrounded by a limiting membrane. However, cytoplasmic filaments were concentrated in a whorled array. These proteins were identified as keratins 8 and 18 (K8/K18), which formed the central core of the SB surrounded by a vimentin cage-like structure. This structure was not related to Mallory-Denk body or aggresome since no aggregated proteins were located in SB. Moreover, the structure of SB was not due to mutations in the primary sequence of K8/K18 and vimentin since no difference was observed in the mRNA sequence of their genes, isolated from Huh-7 and Huh-7w7.3 cells. These data suggested that cellular factor(s) could be responsible for the SB formation process. Aggregates of K18 were relocated in the SB when a mutant of K18 inducing disruption of K8/K18 IF network was expressed in the cellular clone. Furthermore, the INI1 protein, a remodeling-chromatin factor deficient in rhabdoid cells, which contain a spheroid perinuclear inclusion body, was found in our cellular clone. In conclusion, our data suggest that Huh-7w7.3 cells constitute an excellent model for determining the cellular factor(s) involved in the process of spheroid perinuclear body formation.

Abstract: Summary
White adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (DM2). Unrestrained WAT lipolysis results in increased fatty acid release, leading to insulin resistance and lipotoxicity, while impaired de novo lipogenesis in WAT decreases the synthesis of insulin-sensitizing fatty acid species like palmitoleate. Here, we show that insulin infused into the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) of Sprague-Dawley rats increases WAT lipogenic protein expression, inactivates hormone-sensitive lipase (Hsl), and suppresses lipolysis. Conversely, mice that lack the neuronal insulin receptor exhibit unrestrained lipolysis and decreased de novo lipogenesis in WAT. Thus, brain and, in particular, hypothalamic insulin action play a pivotal role in WAT functionality.

Abstract: The mammalian reproductive tract is known to contain 1.5-5.3% oxygen (O2), but human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) derived from preimplantation embryos are typically cultured under 21% O2 tension. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of O2 tension on the long-term culture of hESCs and on cell-fate determination during early differentiation. hESCs and embryoid bodies (EBs) were grown under different O2 tensions (3, 12, and 21% O2). The expression of markers associated with pluripotency, embryonic germ layers, and hypoxia was analyzed using RT-PCR, immunostaining, and Western blotting. Proliferation, apoptosis, and chromosomal aberrations were examined using BrdU incorporation, caspase-3 immunostaining, and karyotype analysis, respectively. Structural and morphological changes of EBs under different O2 tensions were comparatively examined using azan- and hematoxylineosin staining, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Mild hypoxia (12% O2) increased the number of cells expressing Oct4/Nanog and reduced BrdU incorporation and aneuploidy. The percentage of cells positive for active caspase-3, which was high during normoxia (21% O2), gradually decreased when hESCs were continuously cultured under mild hypoxia. EBs subjected to hypoxia (3% O2) exhibited well-differentiated microvilli on their surface, secreted high levels of collagen, and showed enhanced differentiation into primitive endoderm. These changes were associated with increased expression of Foxa2, Sox17, AFP, and GATA4 on the EB periphery. Our data suggest that mild hypoxia facilitates the slow mitotic division of hESCs in long-term culture and reduces the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities and apoptosis. In addition, hypoxia promotes the differentiation of EBs into extraembryonic endoderm.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, fusion of the mitochondrial outer membrane is controlled by two DRPs, MFN1 and MFN2, that function in place of a single outer membrane DRP, Fzo1 in yeast. We addressed the significance of two mammalian outer membrane fusion DRPs using an in vitro mammalian mitochondrial fusion assay. We demonstrate that heterotypic MFN1-MFN2 trans complexes possess greater efficacy in fusion as compared to homotypic MFN1 or MFN2 complexes. In addition, we show that the soluble form of the proapoptotic Bcl2 protein, Bax, positively regulates mitochondrial fusion exclusively through homotypic MFN2 trans complexes. Together, these data demonstrate functional and regulatory distinctions between MFN1 and MFN2 and provide insight into their unique physiological roles.

Abstract: Summary
The complement system, which functions by lysing pathogens directly or by promoting their uptake by phagocytes, is critical for controlling many microbial infections. Here, we show that in Streptococcus pneumoniae, increasing bacterial chain length sensitizes this pathogen to complement deposition and subsequent uptake by human neutrophils. Consistent with this, we show that minimizing chain length provides wild-type bacteria with a competitive advantage in vivo in a model of systemic infection. Investigating how the host overcomes this virulence strategy, we find that antibody promotes complement-dependent opsonophagocytic killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae and lysis of Haemophilus influenzae independent of Fc-mediated effector functions. Consistent with the agglutinating effect of antibody, F(ab′)2 but not Fab could promote this effect. Therefore, increasing pathogen size, whether by natural changes in cellular morphology or via antibody-mediated agglutination, promotes complement-dependent killing. These observations have broad implications for how cell size and morphology can affect virulence among pathogenic microbes.

Abstract: Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules such as high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. The aim of our study was to examine the induced sputum and plasma concentrations of HSP70 in asthmatic patients to determine their relationship with airway obstruction. Thirty-four healthy controls and 56 patients with persistent bronchial asthma matched for gender and age were enrolled in this study. Spirometry measurements were performed before sputum induction. HSP70 levels in induced sputum and plasma were measured using the ELISA Kit. Sputum and plasma concentrations of HSP70 in asthmatics patients were significantly higher than that in control subjects (sputum, (0.88 ng/ml (0.27–1.88 ng/ml) versus 0.42 ng/ml (0.18–0.85 ng/ml), p < 0.001); plasma, (0.46 ng/ml (0.20–0.98 ng/ml) versus 0.14 ng/ml (0.11–0.37 ng/ml), p < 0.001) and were significantly negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1 (percent predicted), and FEV1/FVC in all 90 participants and 56 patients with asthma. There were no significant differences in HSP70 levels between patients with eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic asthma. HSP70 levels in plasma were positively correlated with neutrophil count, and HSP70 levels in induced sputum were positively correlated with lymphocyte count. In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of sputum HSP70 were diseases and disease severity but not smoking, age, or gender, and independent predictors of plasma HSP70 were also diseases and disease severity. In conclusion, this study indicates that induced sputum and plasma HSP70 could serve as a useful marker for assessing the degree of airway obstruction in patients with asthma. However, further investigation is needed to establish the role of circulating and sputum HSP70 in the pathogenesis of asthma.

Abstract: Despite intensive study, the mechanisms regulating activation of mTOR and the consequences of that activation in the ischemic heart remain unclear. This is particularly true for the setting of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In a mouse model of I/R injury, we observed robust mTOR activation, and its inhibition by rapamycin increased injury. Consistent with the in-vivo findings, mTOR activation was also protective in isolated cardiomyocytes exposed to two models of I/R. Moreover, we identify a novel oxidant stress-activated pathway regulating mTOR that is critically dependent on p38-MAPK and Akt. This novel p38-regulated pathway signals downstream through REDD1, Tsc2, and 14-3-3 proteins to activate mTOR and is independent of AMPK. The protective role of p38/Akt and mTOR following oxidant stress is a general phenomenon since we observed it in a wide variety of cell types. Thus we have identified a novel protective pathway in the cardiomyocyte involving p38-mediated mTOR activation. Furthermore, the p38-dependent protective pathway might be able to be selectively modulated to enhance cardio-protection while not interfering with the inhibition of the better-known detrimental p38-dependent pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Physiological levels of KrasG12D are sufficient to induce pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs); the mechanisms that drive PanIN progression are unknown. Here, we establish that, in addition to oncogenic KrasG12D, IL-6 transsignaling-dependent activation of Stat3/Socs3 is required to promote PanIN progression and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Myeloid compartment induces Stat3 activation by secreting IL-6; consequently, IL-6 transsignaling activates Stat3 in the pancreas. Using genetic tools, we show that inactivation of IL-6 transsignaling or Stat3 inhibits PanIN progression and reduces the development of PDAC. Aberrant activation of Stat3 through homozygous deletion of Socs3 in the pancreas accelerates PanIN progression and PDAC development. Our data describe the involvement of IL-6 transsignaling/Stat3/Socs3 in PanIN progression and PDAC development.

Zac1, an Sp1-like protein, regulates human p21WAF1/Cip1 gene expression in HeLa cells,

Abstract: Zac1 functions as both a transcription factor and a transcriptional cofactor for p53, nuclear receptors (NRs) and NR coactivators. Zac1 might also act as a transcriptional repressor via the recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). The ability of Zac1 to interact directly with GC-specific elements indicates that Zac1 possibly binds to Sp1-responsive elements. In the present study, our data show that Zac1 is able to interact directly with the Sp1-responsive element in the p21WAF1/Cip1 gene promoter and enhance the transactivation activity of Sp1 through direct physical interaction. Our data further demonstrate that Zac1 might enhance Sp1-specific promoter activity by interacting with the Sp1-responsive element, affecting the transactivation activity of Sp1 via a protein–protein interaction, or competing the HDAC1 protein away from the pre-existing Sp1/HDAC1 complex. Finally, the synergistic regulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 gene expression by Zac1 and Sp1 is mediated by endogenous p53 protein and p53-responsive elements in HeLa cells. Our work suggests that Zac1 might serve as an Sp1-like protein that directly interacts with the Sp1-responsive element to oligomerize with and/or to coactivate Sp1.

Abstract: Summary
N-α-acetyltransferase 10 protein, Naa10p, is an N-acetyltransferase known to be involved in cell cycle control. We found that Naa10p was expressed lower in varieties of malignancies with lymph node metastasis compared with non-lymph node metastasis. Higher Naa10p expression correlates the survival of lung cancer patients. Naa10p significantly suppressed migration, tumor growth, and metastasis independent of its enzymatic activity. Instead, Naa10p binds to the GIT-binding domain of PIX, thereby preventing the formation of the GIT-PIX-Paxillin complex, resulting in reduced intrinsic Cdc42/Rac1 activity and decreased cell migration. Forced expression of PIX in Naa10-transfected tumor cells restored the migration and metastasis ability. We suggest that Naa10p functions as a tumor metastasis suppressor by disrupting the migratory complex, PIX-GIT- Paxillin, in cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 can infect T cells by cell-free virus or by direct virion transfer between cells through cell contact-induced structures called virological synapses (VS). During VS-mediated infection, virions accumulate within target cell endosomes. We show that after crossing the VS, the transferred virus undergoes both maturation and viral membrane fusion. Following VS transfer, viral membrane fusion occurs with delayed kinetics and transferred virions display reduced sensitivity to patient antisera compared to mature, cell-free virus. Furthermore, particle fusion requires that the transferred virions undergo proteolytic maturation within acceptor cell endosomes, which occurs over several hours. Rapid, live cell confocal microscopy demonstrated that viral fusion can occur in compartments that have moved away from the VS. Thus, HIV particle maturation activates viral fusion in target CD4+ T cell endosomes following transfer across the VS and may represent a pathway by which HIV evades antibody neutralization.

Abstract: Summary
AS160 has emerged as a key player in insulin-mediated glucose transport through controlling GLUT4 trafficking, which is thought to be regulated by insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of sites including the 14-3-3 binding phospho-Thr649 (equivalent to Thr642 in human AS160). To define physiological roles of AS160-Thr649 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding in glucose homeostasis, we substituted this residue by a nonphosphorylatable alanine by knockin mutation in mice. The mutant protein was expressed at normal levels, while insulin-stimulated AS160 binding to 14-3-3s was abolished in homozygous knockin mice. These animals displayed impaired glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity, which were associated with decreased glucose uptake in vivo. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport and cell surface GLUT4 content were reduced in isolated muscles, but not in adipocytes. These results provide genetic evidence that insulin-induced AS160-Thr649 phosphorylation and/or its binding to 14-3-3 play an important role in regulating whole-body glucose homeostasis, at least in part through regulating GLUT4 trafficking in muscle.

Abstract: RhoA activated kinases (ROCKs) are potent effectors of RhoA signaling for regulation of the cytoskeleton. ROCKs have been shown to be localized to several different subcellular locations, suggesting that its localization is context specific and regulated. However, the signaling mechanisms that control ROCK localization have not been clearly described. In this study we measured ROCKII localization following stimulation with the chemokine CXCL12 or adhesion to collagen 1. Strikingly, each of these extracellular signals targeted ROCKII to membrane protrusions. We further determined that both RhoA and PI3-kinase signaling are required for these stimuli to induce efficient membrane localization. Furthermore, we used a mutational approach to show that two separate domains predicted to respond to these localization signals, the Rho Binding Domain (RBD) and the Pleckstrin Homology domain (PH). Unexpectedly, we found that these two domains work synergistically to lead to membrane localization. This suggests a novel mechanism for controlling ROCKII localization at the membrane, in which the ROCKII C-terminus acts as a coincidence detector for spatial regulatory signals. In other words, efficient membrane targeting requires the ROCKII RBD to receive the RhoA signal and the PH domain to receive the phospholipid signal.

Abstract: Ubiquitin-proteasome system has emerged a central player in regulation of diverse cellular processes. However, relevance of proteasome activity in platelets, which are terminally differentiated enucleate cells, is not clear. In this report we show that activation of platelets with physiological agonists was associated with 7–10 -fold rise in proteasomal activity. Elevation of cytosolic calcium with A23187 or thapsigargin resulted in significant increase in enzymatic activity, while treatment with intracellular calcium chelator or inhibitor of inositol trisphosphate receptor attenuated proteasomal enzymes in collagen-stimulated platelets. Specific inhibitors of protein kinase C as well as calpain, too, downregulated proteasome function. To conclude, proteasomal enzymatic activity in platelets is regulated by cytosolic calcium through Ca2+-dependent downstream effectors like calpain and protein kinase C.

Abstract: Summary
Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is caused by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and frequently also harbors Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The expression of KSHV- and EBV-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) in PELs suggests a role for these miRNAs in latency and lymphomagenesis. Using PAR-CLIP, a technology which allows the direct and transcriptome-wide identification of miRNA targets, we delineate the target sites for all viral and cellular miRNAs expressed in PEL cell lines. The resulting data set revealed that KSHV miRNAs directly target more than 2000 cellular mRNAs, including many involved in pathways relevant to KSHV pathogenesis. Moreover, 58% of these mRNAs are also targeted by EBV miRNAs, via distinct binding sites. In addition to a known viral analog of cellular miR-155, we show that KSHV encodes a viral miRNA that mimics cellular miR-142-3p function. In summary, this study identifies an extensive list of KSHV miRNA targets, which are likely to influence viral replication and pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Throughout evolution, organisms have devised strategies to limit fertility in case of prolonged starvation. In mammals, the liver plays a central role in the orchestration of mechanisms allowing for the maintenance of energy homeostasis. We here demonstrate that dietary amino acids regulate the transcriptional activity of hepatic estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) through an mTOR-dependent mechanism. As a result of ERα activation, hepatic IGF-1 mRNA and blood IGF-1 are increased. Conversely, calorie restriction or selective ablation of ERα in the liver decrease blood IGF-1 to levels inadequate for the correct proliferation of the lumen epithelium in the uterus and the progression of the estrous cycle. We propose that the liver acts as critical mediator of energetic and reproductive functions responsible for the blockade of the estrous cycle in case of protein scarcity. Our findings may provide novel insights to understand the cause of selected forms of infertility and metabolic alterations in women after menopause.
