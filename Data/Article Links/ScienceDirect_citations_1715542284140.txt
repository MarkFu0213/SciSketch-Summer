Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) undergo self-renewal and differentiation to guarantee a constant supply of short-lived blood cells. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors determine HSPC fate, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that Proteinase 3 (PR3), a serine protease mainly confined to granulocytes, is also expressed in HSPCs. PR3 deficiency intrinsically suppressed cleavage and activation of caspase-3, leading to expansion of the bone marrow (BM) HSPC population due to decreased apoptosis. PR3-deficient HSPCs outcompete the long-term reconstitution potential of wild-type counterparts. Collectively, our results establish PR3 as a physiological regulator of HSPC numbers. PR3 inhibition is a potential therapeutic target to accelerate and increase the efficiency of BM reconstitution during transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells (NSCs) have the ability to exit quiescence and reactivate in response to physiological stimuli. In the Drosophila brain, insulin receptor (InR)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway triggers NSC reactivation. However, intrinsic mechanisms that control the InR/PI3K/Akt pathway during reactivation remain unknown. Here, we have identified heat shock protein 83 (Hsp83/Hsp90), a molecular chaperone, as an intrinsic regulator of NSC reactivation. Hsp83 is both necessary and sufficient for NSC reactivation by promoting the activation of InR pathway in larval brains in the presence of dietary amino acids. Both Hsp83 and its co-chaperone Cdc37 physically associate with InR. Finally, reactivation defects observed in brains depleted of hsp83 were rescued by over-activation of the InR/PI3K/Akt pathway, suggesting that Hsp83 functions upstream of the InR/PI3K/Akt pathway during NSC reactivation. Given the conservation of Hsp83 and the InR pathway, our finding may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying mammalian NSC reactivation.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal reovirus infection can trigger T helper 1 (TH1) immunity to dietary antigen, raising the question of whether other viruses can have a similar impact. Here we show that the acute CW3 strain of murine norovirus, but not the persistent CR6 strain, induces TH1 immunity to dietary antigen. This property of CW3 is dependent on its major capsid protein, a virulence determinant. Transcriptional profiling of mesenteric lymph nodes following infection reveals an immunopathological signature that does not segregate with protective immunity but with loss of oral tolerance, in which interferon regulatory factor 1 is critical. These data show that viral capacity to trigger specific inflammatory pathways at sites where T cell responses to dietary antigens take place interferes with the development of tolerance to an oral antigen. Collectively, these data provide a foundation for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent TH1-mediated complex immune disorders triggered by viral infections.

Abstract: Honeybee propolis and its bioactive component, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), are known for a variety of therapeutic potentials. By recruiting a cell-based reporter assay for screening of hypoxia-modulating natural drugs, we identified CAPE as a pro-hypoxia factor. In silico studies were used to probe the capacity of CAPE to interact with potential hypoxia-responsive proteins. CAPE could not dock into hypoxia inducing factor (HIF-1), the master regulator of hypoxia response pathway. On the other hand, it was predicted to bind to factor inhibiting HIF (FIH-1). The active site residue (Asp201) of FIH-1α was involved in hydrogen bond formation with CAPE and its analogue, caffeic acid methyl ester (CAME), especially in the presence of Fe and 2-oxoglutaric acid (OGA). We provide experimental evidence that the low doses of CAPE, that did not cause cytotoxicity or anti-migratory effect, activated HIF-1α and inhibited stress-induced protein aggregation, a common cause of age-related pathologies. Furthermore, by structural homology search, we explored and found candidate compounds that possess stronger FIH-1 binding capacity. These compounds could be promising candidates for modulating therapeutic potential of CAPE, and its recruitment in treatment of protein aggregation-based disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane vesicles delivered to the cell-division plane fuse with one another to form the partitioning membrane during plant cytokinesis, starting in the cell center. In Arabidopsis, this requires SNARE complexes involving the cytokinesis-specific Qa-SNARE KNOLLE. However, cytokinesis still occurs in knolle mutant embryos, suggesting contributions from KNOLLE-independent SNARE complexes. Here we show that Qa-SNARE SYP132, having counterparts in lower plants, functionally overlaps with the flowering plant-specific KNOLLE. SYP132 mutation causes cytokinesis defects, knolle syp132 double mutants consist of only one or a few multi-nucleate cells, and SYP132 has the same SNARE partners as KNOLLE. SYP132 and KNOLLE also have non-overlapping functions in secretion and in cellularization of the embryo-nourishing endosperm resulting from double fertilization unique to flowering plants. Evolutionarily ancient non-specialized SNARE complexes originating in algae were thus amended by the appearance of cytokinesis-specific SNARE complexes, meeting the high demand for membrane-fusion capacity during endosperm cellularization in angiosperms.

Abstract: Summary
The small intestine plays an important role in the absorption and metabolism of oral drugs. In the current evaluation system, it is difficult to predict the precise absorption and metabolism of oral drugs. In this study, we generated small intestinal epithelial-like cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS-SIECs), which could be applied to drug absorption and metabolism studies. The small intestinal epithelial-like cells were efficiently generated from human induced pluripotent stem cell by treatment with WNT3A, R-spondin 3, Noggin, EGF, IGF-1, SB202190, and dexamethasone. The gene expression levels of small intestinal epithelial cell (SIEC) markers were similar between the hiPS-SIECs and human adult small intestine. Importantly, the gene expression levels of colonic epithelial cell markers in the hiPS-SIECs were much lower than those in human adult colon. The hiPS-SIECs generated by our protocol exerted various SIEC functions. In conclusion, the hiPS-SIECs can be utilized for evaluation of drug absorption and metabolism.

Abstract: GABAergic interneuron dysfunction has been implicated in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), autism, and schizophrenia. Inhibitory interneuron progenitors transplanted into the hippocampus of rodents with TLE provide varying degrees of seizure suppression. We investigated whether human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived interneuron progenitors (hESNPs) could differentiate, correct hippocampal-dependent spatial memory deficits, and suppress seizures in a pilocarpine-induced TLE mouse model. We found that transplanted ventralized hESNPs differentiated into mature GABAergic interneurons and became electrophysiologically active with mature firing patterns. Some mice developed hESNP-derived tumor-like NSC clusters. Mice with transplants showed significant improvement in the Morris water maze test, but transplants did not suppress seizures. The limited effects of the human GABAergic interneuron progenitor grafts may be due to cell type heterogeneity within the transplants.

Abstract: Summary
Balancer chromosomes are critical tools for genetic research. In C. elegans, reciprocal translocations that lead to aneuploidy have been widely used to maintain lethal and sterile mutations in stable stocks. Here, we generated a set of aneuploidy-free and structurally defined crossover suppressors that contain two overlapping inversions using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The toolkit includes 13 crossover suppressors and covers approximately 63% of all C. elegans coding genes. Together with the classical intrachromosomal crossover suppressors, the system now covers 89% of the coding genes. We also labeled the created balancers with fluorescent and phenotypic markers. We show that the crossover suppressors are better for embryonic analysis compared with translocational balancers. Additionally, we demonstrate an efficient method to generate lethal alleles by targeting essential genes on a chromosome balanced with a crossover suppressor. The toolkit will allow more efficient experiments in which lethal and sterile mutants can be analyzed.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) follows impaired glucose tolerance in obesity and is frequently associated with hypertension, causing adverse myocardial remodelling and leading to heart failure. The DNA bound protein PARP (poly ADP ribose) polymerase catalyses a post translational modification (polymerization of negatively charged ADP-ribose chains) of nuclear proteins. PARP-1 activation is NAD+ dependent and takes part in DNA repair and in chromatin remodelling and has a function in transcriptional regulation, intracellular trafficking and energy metabolism. PARP-1 is activated in diabetic cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that PARP-1 inhibition in diabetic mice may protect cardiomyocytes from inflammation and ROS production.
Methods
Obese Leptin resistant (db/db) mice suffering from DM2, were treated with angiotensin II (AT) for 4 weeks to enhance the development of cardiomyopathy. Mice were concomitantly treated with the PARP-1 inhibitor INO1001. Neonatal cardiomyocytes exposed to high levels of glucose (33 mM) with or without AT were treated with INO1001. or with SIRT inhibitor (EX-527) in the presence of INO1001 were tested in-vitro.
Results
The in-vivo tests show that hearts from AT treated DM2 mice exhibited cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and an increase in the inflammatory marker TNFα. DM2 mice had an increased oxidative stress, concomitant with elevated PARP-1 activity and reduced Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) expression. PARP-1 inhibition led to increased SIRT1 and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) levels, attenuating oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis. In-vitro experiments demonstrated that inhibition of PARP-1 in cardiomyocytes exposed to high levels of glucose and AT led to a significant reduction in ROS (P < 0.01), which was abolished in the presence of the SIRT1 inhibitor together with increased protein expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1α.
Conclusion
PARP1 inhibitor INO1001 attenuated cardiomyopathic features in diabetic mice through the activation of SIRT1 and its downstream antioxidant defence mechanisms. The results of this study suggest a pivotal role of PARP-1 inhibition in treating diabetic and AT-induced cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: Matrine is a natural alkaloid isolated from the root and stem of the legume plant Sophora. Its anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on several types of cancer have been well-documented. However, the role of matrine in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis, particularly mitophagy in liver cancer apoptosis, remains uncertain. The aim of our study was to explore whether matrine promotes liver cancer cell apoptosis by modifying mitophagy. HepG2 cells were used in the study and treated with different doses of matrine. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by MTT assay, TUNEL staining, western blotting, and LDH release assay. Mitophagy was monitored by immunofluorescence assay and western blotting. Mitochondrial function was assessed by immunofluorescence assay, ELISA, and western blotting. The results of our study indicated that matrine treatment dose-dependently reduced cell viability and increased the apoptotic rate of HepG2 cells. Functional studies demonstrated that matrine treatment induced mitochondrial dysfunction and activated mitochondrial apoptosis by inhibiting protective mitophagy. Re-activation of mitophagy abolished the pro-apoptotic effects of matrine on HepG2 cells. Molecular investigations further confirmed that matrine regulated mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathways. Matrine blocked the PINK1/Parkin pathways and repressed mitophagy, whereas activation of the PINK1/Parkin pathways increased mitophagy activity and promoted HepG2 cell survival in the presence of matrine. Together, our data indicated that matrine promoted HepG2 cell apoptosis through a novel mechanism that acted via inhibiting mitophagy and the PINK1/Parkin pathways. This finding provides new insight into the molecular mechanism of matrine for treating liver cancer and offers a potential target to repress liver cancer progression by modulating mitophagy and the PINK1/Parkin pathways.

Abstract: Palmitic acid (PA) is the most common saturated long-chain fatty acid in food that causes cell apoptosis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of PA toxicity. In this study, we explore the effects of PA on proliferation and apoptosis in human osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells and uncover the signaling pathways involved in the process. Our study showed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy are involved in PA-induced Saos-2 cell apoptosis. We found that PA inhibited the viability of Saos-2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. At the same time, PA induced the expression of ER stress marker genes (glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)), altered autophagy-related gene expression (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), ATG5, p62, and Beclin), promoted apoptosis-related gene expression (Caspase 3 and BAX), and affected autophagic flux. Inhibiting ER stress with 4-PBA diminished the PA-induced cell apoptosis, activated autophagy, and increased the expression of Caspase 3 and BAX. Inhibiting autophagy with 3-MA attenuated the PA and ER stress-induced cell apoptosis and the apoptosis-related gene expression (Caspase 3 and BAX), but seemed to have no obvious effects on ER stress, although the CHOP expression was downregulated. Taken together, our results suggest that PA-induced Saos-2 cell apoptosis is activated via ER stress and autophagy, and the activation of autophagy depends on the ER stress during this process.

Abstract: Summary
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. We present a CRISPR gene editing strategy to insert a protein tag and premature termination sites creating an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) knockout resource for functional studies of ten ASD-relevant genes (AFF2/FMR2, ANOS1, ASTN2, ATRX, CACNA1C, CHD8, DLGAP2, KCNQ2, SCN2A, TENM1). Neurogenin 2 (NGN2)-directed induction of iPSCs allowed production of excitatory neurons, and mutant proteins were not detectable. RNA sequencing revealed convergence of several neuronal networks. Using both patch-clamp and multi-electrode array approaches, the electrophysiological deficits measured were distinct for different mutations. However, they culminated in a consistent reduction in synaptic activity, including reduced spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current frequencies in AFF2/FMR2-, ASTN2-, ATRX-, KCNQ2-, and SCN2A-null neurons. Despite ASD susceptibility genes belonging to different gene ontologies, isogenic stem cell resources can reveal common functional phenotypes, such as reduced functional connectivity.

Abstract: Acclimation, via phenotypic flexibility, is a potential means for a fast response to climate change. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning phenotypic flexibility can provide a fine-scale cellular understanding of how organisms acclimate. In the last 30 years, Mya truncata populations around the UK have faced an average increase in sea surface temperature of 0.7°C and further warming of between 1.5 and 4 °C, in all marine regions adjacent to the UK, is predicted by the end of the century. Hence, data are required on the ability of M. truncata to acclimate to physiological stresses, and most notably, chronic increases in temperature. Animals in the present study were exposed to chronic heat-stress for 2 months prior to shell damage and subsequently, only 3, out of 20 damaged individuals, were able to repair their shells within 2 weeks. Differentially expressed genes (between control and damaged animals) were functionally enriched with processes relating to cellular stress, the immune response and biomineralisation. Comparative transcriptomics highlighted genes, and more broadly molecular mechanisms, that are likely to be pivotal in this lack of acclimation. This study demonstrates that discovery-led transcriptomic profiling of animals during stress-response experiments can shed light on the complexity of biological processes and changes within organisms that can be more difficult to detect at higher levels of biological organisation.

Abstract: Summary
The timing of food intake and nutrient utilization is critical to health and regulated partly by the circadian clock. Increased amplitude of circadian oscillations and metabolic output has been found to improve health in diabetic and obesity mouse models. Here, we report a function for the circadian deadenylase Nocturnin as a regulator of metabolic amplitude across the day/night cycle and in response to nutrient challenge. We show that mice lacking Nocturnin (Noct−/−) display significantly increased amplitudes of mRNA expression of hepatic genes encoding key metabolic enzymes regulating lipid and cholesterol synthesis, both over the daily circadian cycle and in response to fasting and refeeding. Noct−/− mice have increased plasma triglyceride throughout the night and increased amplitude of hepatic cholesterol levels. Therefore, posttranscriptional control by Nocturnin regulates the amplitude of these critical metabolic pathways, and loss of this activity results in increased metabolic flux and reduced obesity.

Abstract: Summary
hnRNPA2, a component of RNA-processing membraneless organelles, forms inclusions when mutated in a syndrome characterized by the degeneration of neurons (bearing features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] and frontotemporal dementia), muscle, and bone. Here we provide a unified structural view of hnRNPA2 self-assembly, aggregation, and interaction and the distinct effects of small chemical changes—disease mutations and arginine methylation—on these assemblies. The hnRNPA2 low-complexity (LC) domain is compact and intrinsically disordered as a monomer, retaining predominant disorder in a liquid-liquid phase-separated form. Disease mutations D290V and P298L induce aggregation by enhancing and extending, respectively, the aggregation-prone region. Co-aggregating in disease inclusions, hnRNPA2 LC directly interacts with and induces phase separation of TDP-43. Conversely, arginine methylation reduces hnRNPA2 phase separation, disrupting arginine-mediated contacts. These results highlight the mechanistic role of specific LC domain interactions and modifications conserved across many hnRNP family members but altered by aggregation-causing pathological mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Upon inhibition of respiration, which occurs in hypoxic or nitric oxide-containing host microenvironments, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) adopts a non-replicating “quiescent” state and becomes relatively unresponsive to antibiotic treatment. We used comprehensive mutant fitness analysis to identify regulatory and metabolic pathways that are essential for the survival of quiescent Mtb. This genetic study identified a protein acetyltransferase (Mt-Pat/Rv0998) that promoted survival and altered the flux of carbon from oxidative to reductive tricarboxylic acid (TCA) reactions. Reductive TCA requires malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and maintains the redox state of the NAD+/NADH pool. Genetic or chemical inhibition of MDH resulted in rapid cell death in both hypoxic cultures and in murine lung. These phenotypic data, in conjunction with significant structural differences between human and mycobacterial MDH enzymes that could be exploited for drug development, suggest a new strategy for eradicating quiescent bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
Reproducibility in molecular and cellular studies is fundamental to scientific discovery. To establish the reproducibility of a well-defined long-term neuronal differentiation protocol, we repeated the cellular and molecular comparison of the same two iPSC lines across five distinct laboratories. Despite uncovering acceptable variability within individual laboratories, we detect poor cross-site reproducibility of the differential gene expression signature between these two lines. Factor analysis identifies the laboratory as the largest source of variation along with several variation-inflating confounders such as passaging effects and progenitor storage. Single-cell transcriptomics shows substantial cellular heterogeneity underlying inter-laboratory variability and being responsible for biases in differential gene expression inference. Factor analysis-based normalization of the combined dataset can remove the nuisance technical effects, enabling the execution of robust hypothesis-generating studies. Our study shows that multi-center collaborations can expose systematic biases and identify critical factors to be standardized when publishing novel protocols, contributing to increased cross-site reproducibility.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic bacteria taken up into the macrophage phagosome are the target of many anti-microbial mechanisms. Although mitochondria-derived antimicrobial effectors like reactive oxygen species (mROS) aid in bacterial killing, it is unclear how these effectors reach bacteria within the phagosomal lumen. We show here that endoplasmic reticulum stress triggered upon methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection induces mROS that are delivered to bacteria-containing phagosomes via mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs). The endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor IRE1α induces mROS, specifically hydrogen peroxide (mH2O2), upon MRSA infection. MRSA infection also stimulates the generation of MDVs, which require the mitochondrial stress response factor Parkin, and contributes to mH2O2 accumulation in bacteria-containing phagosomes. Accumulation of phagosomal H2O2 requires Toll-like receptor signaling and the mitochondrial enzyme superoxide dismutase-2 (Sod2), which is delivered to phagosomes by MDVs. Sod2 depletion compromises mH2O2 production and bacterial killing. Thus, mitochondrial redox capacity enhances macrophage antimicrobial function by delivering mitochondria-derived effector molecules into bacteria-containing phagosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient targeting of Hsp70 chaperones to substrate proteins depends on J-domain cochaperones, which in synergism with substrates trigger ATP hydrolysis in Hsp70s and concomitant substrate trapping. We present the crystal structure of the J-domain of Escherichia coli DnaJ in complex with the E. coli Hsp70 DnaK. The J-domain interacts not only with DnaK’s nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) but also with its substrate-binding domain (SBD) and packs against the highly conserved interdomain linker. Mutational replacement of contacts between J-domain and SBD strongly reduces the ability of substrates to stimulate ATP hydrolysis in the presence of DnaJ and compromises viability at heat shock temperatures. Our data demonstrate that the J-domain and the substrate do not deliver completely independent signals for ATP hydrolysis, but the J-domain, in addition to its direct influence on Hsp70s catalytic center, makes Hsp70 more responsive for the hydrolysis-inducing signal of the substrate, resulting in efficient substrate trapping.

Abstract: Summary
Chemo-/radiotherapy resistance is the main cause accounting for most treatment failure in colorectal cancer (CRC). Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are the culprit leading to CRC chemo-/radiotherapy resistance. The underlying regulation mechanism of TICs in CRC remains unclear. Here we discovered that miR-15b expression positively correlated with therapeutic outcome in CRC. Expression of miR-15b in pretreatment biopsy tissue samples predicted tumor regression grade (TRG) in rectal cancer patients after receiving neoadjuvant radiotherapy (nRT). Expression of miR-15b in post-nRT tissue samples was associated with therapeutic outcome. DCLK1 was identified as the direct target gene for miR-15b and its suppression was associated with self-renewal and tumorigenic properties of DCLK1+ TICs. We identified B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region l homolog (BMI1) as a downstream target regulated by miR-15b/DCLK1 signaling. Thus, miR-15b may serve as a valuable marker for prognosis and therapeutic outcome prediction. DCLK1 could be a potential therapeutic target to overcome chemo-/radioresistance in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
The medial habenula (MHb) is an epithalamic hub contributing to expression and extinction of aversive states by bridging forebrain areas and midbrain monoaminergic centers. Although contradictory information exists regarding their synaptic properties, the physiology of the excitatory inputs to the MHb from the posterior septum remains elusive. Here, combining optogenetics-based mapping with ex vivo and in vivo physiology, we examine the synaptic properties of posterior septal afferents to the MHb and how they influence behavior. We demonstrate that MHb cells receive sparse inputs producing purely glutamatergic responses via calcium-permeable α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), heterotrimeric GluN2A-GluN2B-GluN1 N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and inhibitory group II metabotropic glutamate receptors. We describe the complex integration dynamics of these components by MHb cells. Finally, we combine ex vivo data with realistic afferent firing patterns recorded in vivo to demonstrate that efficient optogenetic septal stimulation in the MHb induces anxiolysis and promotes locomotion, contributing long-awaited evidence in favor of the importance of this septo-habenular pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKi) are effective against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but their inefficacy on leukemia stem cells (LSCs) may lead to relapse. To identify new druggable targets alternative to BCR/ABL, we investigated the role of the MEK5/ERK5 pathway in LSC maintenance in low oxygen, a feature of bone marrow stem cell niches. We found that MEK5/ERK5 pathway inhibition reduced the growth of CML patient-derived cells and cell lines in vitro and the number of leukemic cells in vivo. Treatment in vitro of primary CML cells with MEK5/ERK5 inhibitors, but not TKi, strikingly reduced culture repopulation ability (CRA), serial colony formation ability, long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs), and CD26-expressing cells. Importantly, MEK5/ERK5 inhibition was effective on CML cells regardless of the presence or absence of imatinib, and did not reduce CRA or LTC-ICs of normal CD34+ cells. Thus, targeting MEK/ERK5 may represent an innovative therapeutic approach to suppress CML progenitor/stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cell reprogramming is thought to be associated with a full metabolic switch from an oxidative- to a glycolytic-based metabolism. However, neither the dynamics nor the factors controlling this metabolic switch are fully understood. By using cellular, biochemical, protein array, metabolomic, and respirometry analyses, we found that c-MYC establishes a robust bivalent energetics program early in cell reprogramming. Cells prone to undergo reprogramming exhibit high mitochondrial membrane potential and display a hybrid metabolism. We conclude that MYC proteins orchestrate a rewiring of somatic cell metabolism early in cell reprogramming, whereby somatic cells acquire the phenotypic plasticity necessary for their transition to pluripotency in response to either intrinsic or external cues.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian hair follicle arises during embryonic development from coordinated interactions between the epidermis and dermis. It is currently unclear how to recapitulate hair follicle induction in pluripotent stem cell cultures for use in basic research studies or in vitro drug testing. To date, generation of hair follicles in vitro has only been possible using primary cells isolated from embryonic skin, cultured alone or in a co-culture with stem cell-derived cells, combined with in vivo transplantation. Here, we describe the derivation of skin organoids, constituting epidermal and dermal layers, from a homogeneous population of mouse pluripotent stem cells in a 3D culture. We show that skin organoids spontaneously produce de novo hair follicles in a process that mimics normal embryonic hair folliculogenesis. This in vitro model of skin development will be useful for studying mechanisms of hair follicle induction, evaluating hair growth or inhibitory drugs, and modeling skin diseases.

Abstract: In middle and old age, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of brain. As an increasingly aging population, AD represents a huge burden for the patients’ family and the country. However, current therapeutical strategies have shown limited effectiveness. Allicin, which is the main composition of garlic, was reported to prevent the learning and memory impairment of AD mouse model. As the mechanism is not clear, in this study, we used the APP (amyloid precursor protein)/PS1 (presenilin 1) double transgenic mice, which express human mutant APP and PS1, to determine the protective effect of allicin on neurons. AD involves a broad range of clinical, cellular, and biochemical manifestations. This has led to many views of AD, e.g. the amyloid, presenilin, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. We confirmed that allicin improves the cognitive function of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice by reducing the expression levels of Aβ, oxidative stress, and improving mitochondrial dysfunction. Application of behavioral, morphological and molecular biology, and other means were conducted to investigate the effect of allicin, which provide an experimental basis for the reliable application of allicin in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Cell migration is essential to many life processes, including immune response, tissue repair, and cancer progression. A reliable quantitative characterization of the cell migration can therefore aid in the high throughput screening of drug efficacy in wound healing and cancer treatments. In this work, we report what we believe is the first use of SiR-Hoechst for extended live tracking and automated analysis of cell migration and wound healing. We showed through rigorous statistical comparisons that this far-red label does not affect migratory behavior. We observed excellent automated tracking of random cell migration, in which the motility parameters (speed, displacement, path length, directionality ratio, persistence time, and direction autocorrelation) obtained closely match those obtained from manual tracking. We also present an analysis framework to characterize the healing of a scratch wound from the perspective of single cells. The use of SiR-Hoechst is advantageous for the crowded environments in wound healing assays because as long as cell nuclei do not overlap, continuous tracking can be maintained even if there is cell-cell contact. In this paper, we report wound recovery based on the number of cells migrating into the wound over time, normalized by the initial cell count prior to the infliction of the wound. This normalized cell count approach is impervious to operator bias during the arbitration of wound edges and is also robust against variability that arises due to differences in the cell density of different samples. Additional wound healing characteristics were also defined based on the evolution of cell speed and directionality during healing. Not unexpected, the wound healing cells exhibited much higher tendency to maintain the same migratory direction in comparison to the randomly migrating cells. The use of SiR-Hoechst thus greatly simplified the automation of single cell and whole population analysis with high spatial and temporal resolution over extended periods of time.

Abstract: Summary
Adrenal insufficiency is managed by hormone replacement therapy, which is far from optimal; the ability to generate functional steroidogenic cells would offer a unique opportunity for a curative approach to restoring the complex feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Here, we generated human induced steroidogenic cells (hiSCs) from fibroblasts, blood-, and urine-derived cells through forced expression of steroidogenic factor-1 and activation of the PKA and LHRH pathways. hiSCs had ultrastructural features resembling steroid-secreting cells, expressed steroidogenic enzymes, and secreted steroid hormones in response to stimuli. hiSCs were viable when transplanted into the mouse kidney capsule and intra-adrenal. Importantly, the hypocortisolism of hiSCs derived from patients with adrenal insufficiency due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia was rescued by expressing the wild-type version of the defective disease-causing enzymes. Our study provides an effective tool with many potential applications for studying adrenal pathobiology in a personalized manner and opens venues for the development of precision therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Amino acids are known regulators of cellular signaling and physiology, but how they are sensed intracellularly is not fully understood. Herein, we report that each aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) senses its cognate amino acid sufficiency through catalyzing the formation of lysine aminoacylation (K-AA) on its specific substrate proteins. At physiologic levels, amino acids promote ARSs bound to their substrates and form K-AAs on the ɛ-amine of lysines in their substrates by producing reactive aminoacyl adenylates. The K-AA marks can be removed by deacetylases, such as SIRT1 and SIRT3, employing the same mechanism as that involved in deacetylation. These dynamically regulated K-AAs transduce signals of their respective amino acids. Reversible leucylation on ras-related GTP-binding protein A/B regulates activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. Glutaminylation on apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 suppresses apoptosis. We discovered non-canonical functions of ARSs and revealed systematic and functional amino acid sensing and signal transduction networks.

Abstract: Summary
Discovery and characterization of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stem have provided insights for the development of a universal flu vaccine. Identification of signature features common to bnAbs from different individuals will be key to guiding immunogen design. S9-3-37 is a bnAb isolated from a healthy H5N1 vaccinee. Here, structural characterization reveals that the D3-9 gene segment of S9-3-37 contributes most of the interaction surface with the highly conserved stem epitope on HA. Comparison with other influenza bnAb crystal structures indicates that the D3-9 segment provides a general mechanism for targeting HA stem. Interestingly, such bnAbs can approach the HA stem with vastly different angles and orientations. Moreover, D3-9 can be translated in different reading frames in different bnAbs yet still target the same HA stem pocket. Thus, the D3-9 gene segment in the human immune repertoire can provide a robust defense against influenza virus.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T cells convert the time that T cell receptors (TCRs) interact with peptides embedded within class II major histocompatibility complex molecules (pMHCII) into signals that direct cell-fate decisions. In principle, TCRs relay information to intracellular signaling motifs of the associated CD3 subunits, while CD4 recruits the kinase Lck to those motifs upon coincident detection of pMHCII. But the mechanics by which this occurs remain enigmatic. In one model, the TCR and CD4 bind pMHCII independently, while in another, CD4 interacts with a composite surface formed by the TCR-CD3 complex bound to pMHCII. Here, we report that the duration of TCR-pMHCII interactions impact CD4 binding to MHCII. In turn, CD4 increases TCR confinement to pMHCII via reciprocal interactions involving membrane distal and proximal CD4 ectodomains. The data suggest that a precisely assembled macrocomplex functions to reliably convert TCR-pMHCII confinement into reproducible signals that orchestrate adaptive immunity.

Abstract: Summary
A subset of mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) contains taurine-derived modifications at 34U of the anticodon. Loss of taurine modification has been linked to the development of mitochondrial diseases, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Here, we showed that taurine modification is catalyzed by mitochondrial optimization 1 (Mto1) in mammals. Mto1 deficiency severely impaired mitochondrial translation and respiratory activity. Moreover, Mto1-deficient cells exhibited abnormal mitochondrial morphology owing to aberrant trafficking of nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial proteins, including Opa1. The mistargeted proteins were aggregated and misfolded in the cytoplasm, which induced cytotoxic unfolded protein response. Importantly, application of chemical chaperones successfully suppressed cytotoxicity by reducing protein misfolding and increasing functional mitochondrial proteins in Mto1-deficient cells and mice. Thus, our results demonstrate the essential role of taurine modification in mitochondrial translation and reveal an intrinsic protein homeostasis network between the mitochondria and cytosol, which has therapeutic potential for mitochondrial diseases.

Abstract: Summary
[18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT (18F-FDG-PET/CT) imaging has been invaluable for visualizing metabolically active adipose tissues in humans with potential anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects. To explore whether mice display human-like fat depots in anatomically comparable regions, we mapped fat depots using glucose or fatty acid imaging tracers, such as 18F-FDG through PET/CT or [123/125I]-β-methyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid with SPECT/CT imaging, to analogous depots in mice. Using this type of image analysis with both probes, we define a large number of additional areas of high metabolic activity corresponding to novel fat pads. Histological and gene expression analyses validate these regions as bona fide fat pads. Our findings indicate that fat depots of rodents show a high degree of topological similarity to those of humans. Studies involving both glucose and lipid tracers indicate differential preferences for these substrates in different depots and also suggest that fatty acid-based visualized approaches may reveal additional brown adipose tissue and beige depots in humans.

Abstract: In primary bovine fibroblasts with an hspa1b/luciferase transgene, we examined the intensity of heat-shock response (HSR) following four types of oxidative stress or heat stress (HS), and its putative relationship with changes to different cell parameters, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), the redox status of the key molecules glutathione (GSH), NADP(H) NAD(H), and the post-translational protein modifications carbonylation, S-glutathionylation, and ubiquitination. We determined the sub-lethal condition generating the maximal luciferase activity and inducible HSPA protein level for treatments with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), UVA-induced oxygen photo-activation, the superoxide-generating agent menadione (MN), and diamide (DA), an electrophilic and sulfhydryl reagent. The level of HSR induced by oxidative stress was the highest after DA and MN, followed by UVA and H2O2 treatments, and was not correlated to the level of ROS production nor to the extent of protein S-glutathionylation or carbonylation observed immediately after stress. We found a correlation following oxidative treatments between HSR and the level of GSH/GSSG immediately after stress, and the increase in protein ubiquitination during the recovery period. Conversely, HS treatment, which led to the highest HSR level, did not generate ROS nor modified or depended on GSH redox state. Furthermore, the level of protein ubiquitination was maximum immediately after HS and lower than after MN and DA treatments thereafter. In these cells, heat-induced HSR was therefore clearly different from oxidative stress-induced HSR, in which conversely early redox changes of the major cellular thiol predicted the level of HSR and polyubiquinated proteins.

The role that broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) play in natural clearance of human hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which bNAbs, isolated from two humans who spontaneously cleared HCV infection, contribute to HCV control. Using viral gene sequences amplified from longitudinal plasma of the two subjects, we found that these bNAbs, which target the front layer of the HCV envelope protein E2, neutralized most autologous HCV strains. Acquisition of resistance to bNAbs by some autologous strains was accompanied by progressive loss of E2 protein function, and temporally associated with HCV clearance. These data demonstrate that bNAbs can mediate clearance of human HCV infection by neutralizing infecting strains and driving escaped viruses to an unfit state. These immunopathologic events distinguish HCV from HIV-1 and suggest that development of an HCV vaccine may be achievable.

Abstract: The ground state of pluripotency is defined as a minimal unrestricted epigenetic state as present in the Inner Cell Mass. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) grown in a defined serum-free medium with two kinase inhibitors (“2i ESCs”) have been postulated to reflect ground-state pluripotency, whereas ESCs grown in the presence of serum (“serum ESCs”) share more similarities with post-implantation epiblast cells. Pluripotency results from an intricate interplay between cytoplasmic, nuclear and chromatin-associated proteins. Here, we perform quantitative subcellular proteomics to gain insight in the molecular mechanisms sustaining the pluripotent states reflected by 2i and serum ESCs. We describe a full SILAC workflow and quality controls for proteomic comparison of 2i and serum ESCs, allowing subcellular proteomics of the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm and chromatin. The obtained quantitative information revealed increased levels of naïve pluripotency factors on the chromatin of 2i ESCs. Surprisingly, the cytoplasmic proteome suggests that 2i and serum ESCs utilize distinct metabolic programs, which include upregulation of free radical buffering by the glutathione pathway in 2i ESCs. Through induction of intracellular radicals, we show that the altered metabolic environment renders 2i ESCs less sensitive to oxidative stress. Altogether, this work provides novel insights into the proteomic landscape underlying ground state pluripotency.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) features insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, and systemic oxidative stress. Here, heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp 90, adiponectin, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, Hsp32) are profiled in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum from 25 T2DM patients and 25 healthy control subjects. Cells cultured with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin were evaluated by three-color flow cytometry for immunophenotypic biomarkers. Plasma HO-1, Hsp, and adiponectin levels were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Relative to healthy controls, T2DM patients exhibited significantly elevated plasma Hsp70, and representation of T helper immunophenotypes activated to express inflammatory cytokines, including CD4+ IFN-γ+, CD4+ TNF-α+, CD4+ IL-6+, CD4+ IL-1β+ T cells, significantly lower representation of CD4+ IL-10+ T cells, plasma adiponectin and cell-associated HO-1 expression—with no significant differences in plasma Hsp90 between T2DM and healthy controls. Plasma HO-1 and adiponectin in T2DM patients inversely correlated with TNF-α and showed inverse correlation between serum LDL and plasma HO-1. Moreover, TNF-α and Hsp90 in T2DM patients correlated positively with fasting blood glucose (FBG). These results demonstrate correlation between potentially pathogenic T cells, HO-1, and adiponectin, additionally revealing a T helper (Th)1-related character of T2DM immunopathogenesis, suggesting potential for novel T cell-related management strategies for T2DM and related co-morbidities.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) strains can be classified into the ancestral African and contemporary Asian lineages, with the latter responsible for recent epidemics associated with neurological conditions. To understand how Asian strains lead to exacerbated disease, a crucial step is identifying genomic variations that affect infectivity and pathogenicity. Here we use two high-throughput sequencing approaches to assess RNA secondary structures and intramolecular RNA-RNA interactions in vivo for the RNA genomes of Asian and African ZIKV lineages. Our analysis identified functional RNA structural elements and a functional long-range intramolecular interaction specific for the Asian epidemic strains. Mutants that disrupt this extended RNA interaction between the 5′ UTR and the E protein coding region reduce virus infectivity, which is partially rescued with compensatory mutants, restoring this RNA-RNA interaction. These findings illuminate the structural basis of ZIKV regulation and provide a resource for the discovery of RNA structural elements important for ZIKV infection.

Abstract: Summary
The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures faithful segregation of chromosomes. Although most mammalian cell types depend on the SAC for viability, we found that human HAP1 cells can grow SAC independently. We generated MAD1- and MAD2-deficient cells and mutagenized them to identify synthetic lethal interactions, revealing that chromosome congression factors become essential upon SAC deficiency. Besides expected hits, we also found that BUB1 becomes essential in SAC-deficient cells. We found that the BUB1 C terminus regulates alignment as well as recruitment of CENPF. Second, we found that BUBR1 was not essential in SAC-deficient HAP1 cells. We confirmed that BUBR1 does not regulate chromosome alignment in HAP1 cells and that BUB1 does not regulate chromosome alignment through BUBR1. Taken together, our data resolve some long-standing questions about the interplay between BUB1 and BUBR1 and their respective roles in the SAC and chromosome alignment.

Abstract: Summary
Treatment of chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) is challenging due to cell loss, cyst formation, and the glial scar. Previously, we reported on the therapeutic potential of a neural progenitor cell (NPC) and chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) combinatorial therapy for chronic SCI. However, the source of NPCs and delivery system required for ChABC remained barriers to clinical application. Here, we investigated directly reprogrammed human NPCs biased toward an oligodendrogenic fate (oNPCs) in combination with sustained delivery of ChABC using an innovative affinity release strategy in a crosslinked methylcellulose biomaterial for the treatment of chronic SCI in an immunodeficient rat model. This combinatorial therapy increased long-term survival of oNPCs around the lesion epicenter, facilitated greater oligodendrocyte differentiation, remyelination of the spared axons by engrafted oNPCs, enhanced synaptic connectivity with anterior horn cells and neurobehavioral recovery. This combinatorial therapy is a promising strategy to regenerate the chronically injured spinal cord.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a potential unlimited source of insulin-producing β cells for diabetes treatment. A greater understanding of how β cells form during embryonic development will improve current hESC differentiation protocols. All pancreatic endocrine cells, including β cells, are derived from Neurog3-expressing endocrine progenitors. This study characterizes the single-cell transcriptomes of 6,905 mouse embryonic day (E) 15.5 and 6,626 E18.5 pancreatic cells isolated from Neurog3-Cre; Rosa26mT/mG embryos, allowing for enrichment of endocrine progenitors (yellow; tdTomato + EGFP) and endocrine cells (green; EGFP). Using a NEUROG3-2A-eGFP CyT49 hESC reporter line (N5-5), 4,462 hESC-derived GFP+ cells were sequenced. Differential expression analysis revealed enrichment of markers that are consistent with progenitor, endocrine, or previously undescribed cell-state populations. This study characterizes the single-cell transcriptomes of mouse and hESC-derived endocrine progenitors and serves as a resource (https://lynnlab.shinyapps.io/embryonic_pancreas) for improving the formation of functional β-like cells from hESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining balance after an external perturbation requires modification of ongoing motor plans and the selection of contextually appropriate muscle activation patterns that respect body and limb position. We have used the vestibular system to generate sensory-evoked transitions in motor programming. In the face of a rapid balance perturbation, the lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN) generates exclusive extensor muscle activation and selective early extension of the hindlimb, followed by the co-activation of extensor and flexor muscle groups. The temporal separation in EMG response to balance perturbation reflects two distinct cell types within the LVN that generate different phases of this motor program. Initially, an LVNextensor population directs an extension movement that reflects connections with extensor, but not flexor, motor neurons. A distinct LVNco-activation population initiates muscle co-activation via the pontine reticular nucleus. Thus, distinct circuits within the LVN generate different elements of a motor program involved in the maintenance of balance.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether exposure to particles induces an imbalance in 70-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70). Since intracellularly (iHSP70) it has anti-inflammatory roles whereas extracellularly (eHSP70) it has pro-inflammatory roles, we evaluate the effect of residual oil fly ash (ROFA) exposure on eHSP70-to-iHSP70 ratio (H index), a biomarker of inflammatory status that is related to oxidative stress in plasma and lymphoid tissue. Wistar rats that received ROFA suspension for three consecutive days (750 μg) showed an increase in plasma eHSP70 levels (mainly the 72-kDa inducible form). Also, ROFA promoted alterations on plasma oxidative stress (increased protein carbonyl groups and superoxide dismutase activity, and decrease sulfhydryl groups). There was an increase in H index of the plasma/thymus with no changes in circulating leukocyte level, iHSP70, or oxidative stress markers in lymphoid tissues. Our results support the hypothesis that eHSP70 content and H index represent inflammatory and oxidative biomarkers.

Abstract: Summary
A quarter of all solid tumors harbor KRAS oncogenes. Yet, no selective drugs have been approved to treat these malignancies. Genetic interrogation of the MAPK pathway revealed that systemic ablation of MEK or ERK kinases in adult mice prevent tumor development but are unacceptably toxic. Here, we demonstrate that ablation of c-RAF expression in advanced tumors driven by KrasG12V/Trp53 mutations leads to significant tumor regression with no detectable appearance of resistance mechanisms. Tumor regression results from massive apoptosis. Importantly, systemic abrogation of c-RAF expression does not inhibit canonical MAPK signaling, hence, resulting in limited toxicities. These results are of significant relevance for the design of therapeutic strategies to treat K-RAS mutant cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine efforts are hampered by the extensive genetic diversity of HCV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. Structures of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) (e.g., HEPC3, HEPC74) isolated from individuals who spontaneously cleared HCV infection facilitate immunogen design to elicit antibodies against multiple HCV variants. However, challenges in expressing HCV glycoproteins previously limited bNAb-HCV structures to complexes with truncated E2 cores. Here we describe crystal structures of full-length E2 ectodomain complexes with HEPC3 and HEPC74, revealing lock-and-key antibody-antigen interactions, E2 regions (including a target of immunogen design) that were truncated or disordered in E2 cores, and an antibody CDRH3 disulfide motif that exhibits common interactions with a conserved epitope despite different bNAb-E2 binding orientations. The structures display unusual features relevant to common genetic signatures of HCV bNAbs and demonstrate extraordinary plasticity in antibody-antigen interactions. In addition, E2 variants that bind HEPC3/HEPC74-like germline precursors may represent candidate vaccine immunogens.

Abstract: Summary
Most cells in the liver are polyploid, but the functional role of polyploidy is unknown. Polyploidization occurs through cytokinesis failure and endoreduplication around the time of weaning. To interrogate polyploidy while avoiding irreversible manipulations of essential cell-cycle genes, we developed orthogonal mouse models to transiently and potently alter liver ploidy. Premature weaning, as well as knockdown of E2f8 or Anln, allowed us to toggle between diploid and polyploid states. While there was no detectable impact of ploidy alterations on liver function, metabolism, or regeneration, mice with more polyploid hepatocytes suppressed tumorigenesis and mice with more diploid hepatocytes accelerated tumorigenesis in mutagen- and high-fat-induced models. Mechanistically, the diploid state was more susceptible to Cas9-mediated tumor-suppressor loss but was similarly susceptible to MYC oncogene activation, indicating that polyploidy differentially protected the liver from distinct genomic aberrations. This suggests that polyploidy evolved in part to prevent malignant outcomes of liver injury.

Abstract: Summary
Sepsis is a life-threatening inflammatory syndrome accompanying a bloodstream infection. Frequently secondary to pathogenic bacterial infections, sepsis remains difficult to treat as a singular disease mechanism. We compared the pathogenesis of murine sepsis experimentally elicited by five bacterial pathogens and report similarities among host responses to Gram-negative Salmonella and E. coli. We observed that a host protective mechanism involving de-toxification of lipopolysaccharide by circulating alkaline phosphatase (AP) isozymes was incapacitated during sepsis caused by Salmonella or E. coli through activation of host Toll-like receptor 4, which triggered Neu1 and Neu3 neuraminidase induction. Elevated neuraminidase activity accelerated the molecular aging and clearance of AP isozymes, thereby intensifying disease. Mice deficient in the sialyltransferase ST3Gal6 displayed increased disease severity, while deficiency of the endocytic lectin hepatic Ashwell-Morell receptor was protective. AP augmentation or neuraminidase inhibition diminished inflammation and promoted host survival. This study illuminates distinct routes of sepsis pathogenesis, which may inform therapeutic development.

Abstract: Summary
The jaw is central to the extensive variety of feeding and predatory behaviors across vertebrates. The bones of the lower but not upper jaw form around an early-developing cartilage template. Whereas Endothelin1 patterns the lower jaw, the factors that specify upper-jaw morphology remain elusive. Here, we identify Nuclear Receptor 2f genes (Nr2fs) as enriched in and required for upper-jaw formation in zebrafish. Combinatorial loss of Nr2fs transforms maxillary components of the upper jaw into lower-jaw-like structures. Conversely, nr2f5 misexpression disrupts lower-jaw development. Genome-wide analyses reveal that Nr2fs repress mandibular gene expression and early chondrogenesis in maxillary precursors. Rescue of lower-jaw defects in endothelin1 mutants by reducing Nr2f dosage further demonstrates that Nr2f expression must be suppressed for normal lower-jaw development. We propose that Nr2fs shape the upper jaw by protecting maxillary progenitors from early chondrogenesis, thus preserving cells for later osteogenesis.

CCL20, a direct-acting pro-angiogenic chemokine induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV): Potential role in HCV-related liver cancer,

Abstract: The CCL20/CCR6 chemokine/receptor axis has previously been shown to contribute to the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through the recruitment of CCR6-positive leukocytes to the tumor microenvironment. In particular, high serum levels of CCL20 are reported in patients with HCC induced by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). A potential non-immune role for the CCL20/CCR6 axis in HCC development has not yet been investigated. Microarray analysis (Benkheil et al., paper submitted for publication), revealed that CCL20 is highly upregulated in hepatoma cells infected with HCV compared with non-infected hepatoma cells. To determine the role of the CCL20/CCR6 axis in HCV-related HCC, we first explored which cell populations express CCR6 in human liver tissue with chronic disease or HCC. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis revealed that CCR6 is present on endothelial cells (ECs) of portal blood vessels in livers with chronic HCV infection and in HCV- and alcoholic-HCC tissue. In addition, we found CCR6 to be expressed on primary macrovascular (HUVECs) and microvascular ECs (HMVEC-ds) where it co-expressed with the endothelial marker CD31. In vitro angiogenesis experiments revealed that CCL20 is a direct pro-angiogenic molecule that induces EC invasion, sprouting and migration through CCR6. Moreover, using the angiogenesis matrigel plug assay in immunodeficient NMRI-nu mice, we clearly showed that CCL20 induces blood vessel formation, by attracting CCR6-positive ECs. Finally, we demonstrated that HCV-induced CCL20 protein expression and secretion in hepatoma cells could be abolished by antiviral treatment, indicating that CCL20 expression is dependent on HCV replication. In contrast to HCV, HBV-infection resulted in a decreased expression of CCL20, implying a virus-specific effect. Taken together, we identified HCV-induced CCL20 as a direct pro-angiogenic factor that acts on endothelial CCR6. These results suggest that the CCL20/CCR6 axis contributes to hepatic angiogenesis, promoting the hypervascular state of HCV-HCC.

Abstract: Summary
We generated patient-specific disease-free induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from peripheral blood CD34+ cells and differentiated them into functional endothelial cells (ECs) secreting factor VIII (FVIII) for gene and cell therapy approaches to cure hemophilia A (HA), an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by F8 mutations. iPSCs were transduced with a lentiviral vector carrying FVIII transgene driven by an endothelial-specific promoter (VEC) and differentiated into bona fide ECs using an optimized protocol. FVIII-expressing ECs were intraportally transplanted in monocrotaline-conditioned non-obese diabetic (NOD) severe combined immune-deficient (scid)-IL2rγ null HA mice generating a chimeric liver with functional human ECs. Transplanted cells engrafted and proliferated in the liver along sinusoids, in the long term showed stable therapeutic FVIII activity (6%). These results demonstrate that the hemophilic phenotype can be rescued by transplantation of ECs derived from HA FVIII-corrected iPSCs, confirming the feasibility of cell-reprogramming strategy in patient-derived cells as an approach for HA gene and cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) removes misfolded proteins from the ER membrane and lumen by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated substrates to the cytosol is a universal feature of ERAD that requires the Cdc48 AAA-ATPase. Despite intense efforts, the mechanism of ER exit, particularly for integral membrane (ERAD-M) substrates, has remained unclear. Using a self-ubiquitinating substrate (SUS), which undergoes normal retrotranslocation independently of known ERAD factors, and the new SPOCK (single plate orf compendium kit) micro-library to query all yeast genes, we found the rhomboid derlin Dfm1 was required for retrotranslocation of both HRD and DOA ERAD pathway integral membrane substrates. Dfm1 recruited Cdc48 to the ER membrane with its unique SHP motifs, and it catalyzed substrate extraction through its conserved rhomboid motifs. Surprisingly, dfm1Δ can undergo rapid suppression, restoring wild-type ERAD-M. This unexpected suppression explained earlier studies ruling out Dfm1, and it revealed an ancillary ERAD-M retrotranslocation pathway requiring Hrd1.

Abstract: Summary
The production of blood cells and their precursors from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro has the potential to make a significant impact upon healthcare provision. We demonstrate that the forward programming of hPSCs through overexpression of GATA1, FLI1, and TAL1 leads to the production of a population of progenitors that can differentiate into megakaryocyte or erythroblasts. Using “rainbow” lentiviral vectors to quantify individual transgene expression in single cells, we demonstrate that the cell fate decision toward an erythroblast or megakaryocyte is dictated by the level of FLI1 expression and is independent of culture conditions. Early FLI1 expression is critical to confer proliferative potential to programmed cells while its subsequent silencing or maintenance dictates an erythroid or megakaryocytic fate, respectively. These committed progenitors subsequently expand and mature into megakaryocytes or erythroblasts in response to thrombopoietin or erythropoietin. Our results reveal molecular mechanisms underlying hPSC forward programming and novel opportunities for application to transfusion medicine.

Abstract: Hypothyroidism (Hypo) is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure. Hypo rapidly induces Ca2+ mishandling and contractile dysfunction (CD), as well as atrophy and ventricular myocytes (VM) remodeling. Hypo decreases SERCA-to-phospholamban ratio (SERCA/PLB), and thereby contributes to CD. Nevertheless, detailed spatial and temporal Ca2+ cycling characterization in VM is missing, and contribution of other structural and functional changes to the mechanism underlying Ca2+ mishandling and CD, as transverse tubules (T-T) remodeling, mitochondrial density (Dmit) and energy availability, is unclear. Therefore, in a rat model of Hypo, we aimed to characterize systolic and diastolic Ca2+ signaling, T-T remodeling, Dmit, citrate synthase (CS) activity and high-energy phosphate metabolites (ATP and phosphocreatine). We confirmed a decrease in SERCA/PLB (59%), which slowed SERCA activity (48%), reduced SR Ca2+ (19%) and blunted Ca2+ transient amplitude (41%). Moreover, assessing the rate of SR Ca2+ release (dRel/dt), we found that early and maximum dRel/dt decreased, and this correlated with staggered Ca2+ transients. However, dRel/dt persisted during Ca2+ transient relaxation due to abundant late Ca2+ sparks. Isoproterenol significantly up-regulated systolic Ca2+ cycling. T-T were unchanged, hence, cannot explain staggered Ca2+ transients and altered dRel/dt. Therefore, we suggest that these might be caused by RyR2 clusters desynchronization, due to diminished Ca2+-dependent sensitivity of RyR2, which also caused a decrease in diastolic SR Ca2+ leak. Furthermore, Dmit was unchanged and CS activity slightly decreased (14%), however, the ratio phosphocreatine/ATP did not change, therefore, energy deficiency cannot account for Ca2+ and contractility dysregulation. We conclude that decreased SR Ca2+, due to slower SERCA, disrupts systolic RyR2 synchronization, and this underlies CD.

Abstract: Summary
Cytoplasmic dynein-1 is a minus-end-directed motor protein that transports cargo over long distances and organizes the intracellular microtubule (MT) network. How dynein motor activity is harnessed for these diverse functions remains unknown. Here, we have uncovered a mechanism for how processive dynein-dynactin complexes drive MT-MT sliding, reorganization, and focusing, activities required for mitotic spindle assembly. We find that motors cooperatively accumulate, in limited numbers, at MT minus-ends. Minus-end accumulations drive MT-MT sliding, independent of MT orientation, resulting in the clustering of MT minus-ends. At a mesoscale level, activated dynein-dynactin drives the formation and coalescence of MT asters. Macroscopically, dynein-dynactin activity leads to bulk contraction of millimeter-scale MT networks, suggesting that minus-end accumulations of motors produce network-scale contractile stresses. Our data provide a model for how localized dynein activity is harnessed by cells to produce contractile stresses within the cytoskeleton, for example, during mitotic spindle assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Increased glucose metabolism in immune cells not only serves as a hallmark feature of acute inflammation but also profoundly affects disease outcome following bacterial infection and tissue damage. However, the role of individual glucose metabolic pathways during viral infection remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate an essential function of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP)-associated O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) signaling in promoting antiviral innate immunity. Challenge of macrophages with vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) enhances HBP activity and downstream protein O-GlcNAcylation. Human and murine cells deficient of O-GlcNAc transferase, a key enzyme for protein O-GlcNAcylation, show defective antiviral immune responses upon VSV challenge. Mechanistically, O-GlcNAc transferase-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of the signaling adaptor MAVS on serine 366 is required for K63-linked ubiquitination of MAVS and subsequent downstream retinoic-acid inducible gene-like receptor -antiviral signaling activation. Thus, our study identifies a molecular mechanism by which HBP-mediated O-GlcNAcylation regulates MAVS function and highlights the importance of glucose metabolism in antiviral innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
To build comprehensive models of cellular states and interactions in normal and diseased tissue, genetic and proteomic information must be extracted with single-cell and spatial resolution. Here, we extended imaging mass cytometry to enable multiplexed detection of mRNA and proteins in tissues. Three mRNA target species were detected by RNAscope-based metal in situ hybridization with simultaneous antibody detection of 16 proteins. Analysis of 70 breast cancer samples showed that HER2 and CK19 mRNA and protein levels are moderately correlated on the single-cell level, but that only HER2, and not CK19, has strong mRNA-to-protein correlation on the cell population level. The chemoattractant CXCL10 was expressed in stromal cell clusters, and the frequency of CXCL10-expressing cells correlated with T cell presence. Our flexible and expandable method will allow an increase in the information content retrieved from patient samples for biomedical purposes, enable detailed studies of tumor biology, and serve as a tool to bridge comprehensive genomic and proteomic tissue analysis.

Abstract: Summary
TRIM5 is a RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase with potent antiretroviral function. TRIM5 assembles into a hexagonal lattice on retroviral capsids, causing envelopment of the infectious core. Concomitantly, TRIM5 initiates innate immune signaling and orchestrates disassembly of the viral particle, yet how these antiviral responses are regulated by capsid recognition is unclear. We show that hexagonal assembly triggers N-terminal polyubiquitination of TRIM5 that collectively drives antiviral responses. In uninfected cells, N-terminal monoubiquitination triggers non-productive TRIM5 turnover. Upon TRIM5 assembly on virus, a trivalent RING arrangement allows elongation of N-terminally anchored K63-linked ubiquitin chains (N-K63-Ub). N-K63-Ub drives TRIM5 innate immune stimulation and proteasomal degradation. Inducing ubiquitination before TRIM5 assembly triggers premature degradation and ablates antiviral restriction. Conversely, driving N-K63 ubiquitination after TRIM5 assembly enhances innate immune signaling. Thus, the hexagonal geometry of TRIM5’s antiviral lattice converts a capsid-binding protein into a multifunctional antiviral platform.

Abstract: Summary
Menopause results in a progressive decline in 17β-estradiol (E2) levels, increased adiposity, decreased insulin sensitivity, and a higher risk for type 2 diabetes. Estrogen therapies can help reverse these effects, but the mechanism(s) by which E2 modulates susceptibility to metabolic disease is not well understood. In young C57BL/6N mice, short-term ovariectomy decreased—whereas E2 therapy restored—mitochondrial respiratory function, cellular redox state (GSH/GSSG), and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. E2 was detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in mitochondrial membranes and varied according to whole-body E2 status independently of ERα. Loss of E2 increased mitochondrial membrane microviscosity and H2O2 emitting potential, whereas E2 administration in vivo and in vitro restored membrane E2 content, microviscosity, complex I and I + III activities, H2O2 emitting potential, and submaximal OXPHOS responsiveness. These findings demonstrate that E2 directly modulates membrane biophysical properties and bioenergetic function in mitochondria, offering a direct mechanism by which E2 status broadly influences energy homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Liver-specific disruption of the type 2 deiodinase gene (Alb-D2KO) results in resistance to both diet-induced obesity and liver steatosis in mice. Here, we report that this is explained by an ∼60% reduction in liver zinc-finger protein-125 (Zfp125) expression. Zfp125 is a Foxo1-inducible transcriptional repressor that causes lipid accumulation in the AML12 mouse hepatic cell line and liver steatosis in mice by reducing liver secretion of triglycerides and hepatocyte efflux of cholesterol. Zfp125 acts by repressing 18 genes involved in lipoprotein structure, lipid binding, and transport. The ApoE promoter contains a functional Zfp125-binding element that is also present in 17 other lipid-related genes repressed by Zfp125. While liver-specific knockdown of Zfp125 causes an “Alb-D2KO-like” metabolic phenotype, liver-specific normalization of Zfp125 expression in Alb-D2KO mice rescues the phenotype, restoring normal susceptibility to diet-induced obesity, liver steatosis, and hypercholesterolemia.

Abstract: Nucleoporins (Nups) are a large and diverse family of proteins that mediate nucleocytoplasmic transport at interphase of vertebrate cells. Nups also function in mitosis progression. However, whether Nups are involved in oocyte meiosis progression is still rarely known. In this study, we delineated the roles and regulatory mechanisms of Nucleoporin35 (Nup35) during oocyte meiotic maturation. The immunofluorescent signal of Nup35 was localized in the nuclear membrane at germinal vesicle (GV) stage, the microtubules and spindle at pro-metaphase I (pro-MI), metaphase I (MI), and metaphase II (MII), but to the spindle poles at anaphase I (AI) and telophase I (TI). The dynamic localization pattern of Nup35 during oocyte meiotic maturation implied its specific roles. We also found that Nup35 existed as a putatively phosphorylated form after resumption of meiosis (GVBD), but not at GV stage, implying its functional switch from nuclear membrane to meiotic progression. Further study uncovered that knockdown of Nup35 by specific siRNA significantly compromised the extrusion of first polar body (PBE), but not GVBD, with defects of spindle assembly and chromosome alignment and dissociated some localization signal of p-ERK1/2 from spindle poles to cytoplasm. A defective kinetochore - microtubule attachment (K-MT) was also identified in oocytes after knockdown of Nup35, which activates spindle assembly checkpoint. In conclusion, our results suggest that Nup35 is putatively phosphorylated and released to the cytoplasm after resumption of meiosis, and regulates spindle assembly and chromosome alignment.

Abstract: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the urinary system, and its incidence continues to increase. Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), one of the genes on chromosome 21, is a crucial mediator of tumor inhibition. RCAN1.4 is best characterized as an endogenous inhibitor of the phosphatase calcineurin, and it has been observed to be downregulated in numerous types of cancer. However, its essential function remains unclear in ccRCC. In the present study, we found that RCAN1.4 expression was frequently downregulated in renal cell carcinoma tissues and cells and was inversely correlated with various clinicopathological parameters. Low RCAN1.4 expression was associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival and could act as a diagnostic indicator in ccRCC patients. Furthermore, the overexpression of RCAN1.4 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas RCAN1.4 knockdown promoted these functions in ccRCC cell lines. In addition, RCAN1.4 expression was downregulated in sunitinib-resistant renal cancer cell lines, and inhibition of RCAN1.4 promoted sunitinib resistance. We also found that RCAN1.4 could regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the expression of HIF2α in sunitinib-resistant cell lines. Taken together, these findings indicate that downregulation of RCAN1.4 may be crucial for the metastasis of ccRCC and may induce sunitinib resistance. RCAN1.4 may act as a prognostic indicator and potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.

Abstract: This study characterizes dynamic and apoptotic blebbing in human embryonic stem cells (hESC), identifies dynamic blebbing as a bottleneck to successful cell attachment during passaging, and demonstrates that dynamic blebbing can be rapidly stopped by plating cells on recombinant human laminin. In freshly plated hESC, dynamic and apoptotic blebbing differed in time of occurrence, bleb retraction rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase 3&7 activation. While dynamic blebbing can be controlled with drugs that inhibit myosin II, these methods have off-target effects and are not suitable for clinical applications. Recombinant human laminin-521 or addition of laminin-111 to Matrigel provided a safe method to drastically decrease dynamic blebbing and improve cell attachment with proteins normally found in the inner cell mass. Inhibition of focal adhesion kinase, which is activated by binding of integrins to laminin, prolonged dynamic blebbing and inhibited attachment. These data show that hESC bind rapidly to laminins through an integrin, which activates focal adhesion kinase that in turn downregulates dynamic blebbing. Laminins enabled hESC to rapidly attach during passaging, improved plating efficiency, enabled passaging of single pluripotent stem cells, and avoided use of inhibitors that have non-specific off-target effects. These data provide a strategy for improving hESC culture using biologically safe recombinant human proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal subtype is largely fixed in the adult mammalian brain. Here, however, we unexpectedly reveal that adult mouse striatal neurons can be reprogrammed into dopaminergic neuron-like cells (iDALs). This in vivo phenotypic reprogramming can be promoted by a stem cell factor (SOX2), three dopaminergic neuron-enriched transcription regulators (NURR1, LMX1A, and FOXA2), and a chemical compound (valproic acid). Although the site of action of the reprogramming factors remains to be determined, immunohistochemistry and genetic lineage mappings confirm striatal neurons as the cell origin for iDALs. iDALs exhibit electrophysiological properties stereotypical to endogenous dopaminergic rather than striatal neurons. Together, these results indicate that neuronal phenotype can be reengineered even in the adult brain, implicating a therapeutic strategy for neurological diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Symbionts play an indispensable role in gut homeostasis, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To clarify the role of lactic-acid-producing bacteria (LAB) on intestinal stem-cell (ISC)-mediated epithelial development, we fed mice with LAB-type symbionts such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. Here we show that administration of LAB-type symbionts significantly increased expansion of ISCs, Paneth cells, and goblet cells. Lactate stimulated ISC proliferation through Wnt/β-catenin signals of Paneth cells and intestinal stromal cells. Moreover, Lactobacillus plantarum strains lacking lactate dehydrogenase activity, which are deficient in lactate production, elicited less ISC proliferation. Pre-treatment with LAB-type symbionts or lactate protected mice in response to gut injury provoked by combined treatments with radiation and a chemotherapy drug. Impaired ISC-mediated epithelial development was found in mice deficient of the lactate G-protein-coupled receptor, Gpr81. Our results demonstrate that LAB-type symbiont-derived lactate plays a pivotal role in promoting ISC-mediated epithelial development in a Gpr81-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV), which emerged in regions endemic to dengue virus (DENV), is vertically transmitted and results in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Antibodies to DENV can cross-react with ZIKV, but whether these antibodies influence ZIKV vertical transmission remains unclear. Here, we find that DENV antibodies increase ZIKV infection of placental macrophages (Hofbauer cells [HCs]) from 10% to over 80% and enhance infection of human placental explants. ZIKV-anti-DENV antibody complexes increase viral binding and entry into HCs but also result in blunted type I interferon, pro-inflammatory cytokine, and antiviral responses. Additionally, ZIKV infection of HCs and human placental explants is enhanced in an immunoglobulin G subclass-dependent manner, and targeting FcRn reduces ZIKV replication in human placental explants. Collectively, these findings support a role for pre-existing DENV antibodies in enhancement of ZIKV infection of select placental cell types and indicate that pre-existing immunity to DENV should be considered when addressing ZIKV vertical transmission.

Abstract: Summary
Recent proteome analyses have provided a comprehensive overview of various posttranslational modifications (PTMs); however, PTMs involving protein citrullination remain unclear. We performed a proteomic analysis of citrullinated proteins, and we identified more than 100 PAD4 (peptidyl arginine deiminase 4) substrates. Approximately one-fifth of the PAD4 substrates contained an RG/RGG motif, and PAD4 competitively inhibited the methylation of the RGG motif in FET proteins (FUS, EWS, and TAF15) and hnRNPA1, which are causative genes for ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). PAD4-mediated citrullination significantly inhibited the aggregation of FET proteins, a frequently observed feature in neurodegenerative diseases. FUS protein levels in arsenic-induced stress granules were significantly increased in Padi4−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Moreover, rs2240335 was associated with low expression of PADI4 in the brain and a high risk of ALS (p = 0.0381 and odds ratio of 1.072). Our findings suggest that PAD4-mediated RGG citrullination plays a key role in protein solubility and ALS pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Noisy gene expression generates diverse phenotypes, but little is known about mechanisms that modulate noise. Combining experiments and modeling, we studied how tumor necrosis factor (TNF) initiates noisy expression of latent HIV via the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and how the HIV genomic integration site modulates noise to generate divergent (low-versus-high) phenotypes of viral activation. We show that TNF-induced transcriptional noise varies more than mean transcript number and that amplification of this noise explains low-versus-high viral activation. For a given integration site, live-cell imaging shows that NF-κB activation correlates with viral activation, but across integration sites, NF-κB activation cannot account for differences in transcriptional noise and phenotypes. Instead, differences in transcriptional noise are associated with differences in chromatin state and RNA polymerase II regulation. We conclude that, whereas NF-κB regulates transcript abundance in each cell, the chromatin environment modulates noise in the population to support diverse HIV activation in response to TNF.

Abstract: Summary
A balance between Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells is critical for immune homeostasis and tolerance. Our previous work has shown Serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1) is critical for the development and function of Th17 cells. Here, we show that SGK1 restrains the function of Treg cells and reciprocally regulates development of Th17/Treg balance. SGK1 deficiency leads to protection against autoimmunity and enhances self-tolerance by promoting Treg cell development and disarming Th17 cells. Treg cell-specific deletion of SGK1 results in enhanced Treg cell-suppressive function through preventing Foxo1 out of the nucleus, thereby promoting Foxp3 expression by binding to Foxp3 CNS1 region. Furthermore, our data suggest that SGK1 also plays a critical role in IL-23R-mediated inhibition of Treg and development of Th17 cells. Therefore, we demonstrate that SGK1 functions as a pivotal node in regulating the reciprocal development of pro-inflammatory Th17 and Foxp3+ Treg cells during autoimmune tissue inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal motor axons traverse large distances to innervate target muscles, thus requiring local control of cellular events for proper functioning. To interrogate axon-specific processes we developed Axon-seq, a refined method incorporating microfluidics, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and bioinformatic quality control. We show that the axonal transcriptome is distinct from that of somas and contains fewer genes. We identified 3,500–5,000 transcripts in mouse and human stem cell-derived spinal motor axons, most of which are required for oxidative energy production and ribogenesis. Axons contained transcription factor mRNAs, e.g., Ybx1, with implications for local functions. As motor axons degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we investigated their response to the SOD1G93A mutation, identifying 121 ALS-dysregulated transcripts. Several of these are implicated in axonal function, including Nrp1, Dbn1, and Nek1, a known ALS-causing gene. In conclusion, Axon-seq provides an improved method for RNA-seq of axons, increasing our understanding of peripheral axon biology and identifying therapeutic targets in motor neuron disease.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRCs) are clinically heterogeneous, but the genomic basis of this variability remains poorly understood. We performed prospective targeted sequencing of 1,134 CRCs. We identified splice alterations in intronic regions of APC and large in-frame deletions in CTNNB1, increasing oncogenic WNT pathway alterations to 96% of CRCs. Right-sided primary site in microsatellite stable mCRC was associated with shorter survival, older age at diagnosis, increased mutations, and enrichment of oncogenic alterations in KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, AKT1, RNF43, and SMAD4 compared with left-sided primaries. Left-sided tumors frequently had no identifiable genetic alteration in mitogenic signaling, but exhibited higher mitogenic ligand expression. Our results suggest different pathways to tumorigenesis in right- and left-sided microsatellite stable CRC that may underlie clinical differences.

Abstract: Summary
Long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the cerebellum are important for motor learning. However, the signaling mechanisms controlling whether LTD or LTP is induced in response to synaptic stimulation remain obscure. Using a unified model of LTD and LTP at the cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (PF-PC) synapse, we delineate the coordinated pre- and postsynaptic signaling that determines the direction of plasticity. We show that LTP is the default response to PF stimulation above a well-defined frequency threshold. However, if the calcium signal surpasses the threshold for CaMKII activation, then an ultrasensitive “on switch” activates an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-based positive feedback loop that triggers LTD instead. This postsynaptic feedback loop is sustained by another, trans-synaptic, feedback loop that maintains nitric oxide production throughout LTD induction. When full depression is achieved, an automatic “off switch” inactivates the feedback loops, returning the network to its basal state and demarcating the end of the early phase of LTD.

Abstract: Summary
Specification of the three germ layers by graded Nodal signaling has long been seen as a paradigm for patterning through a single morphogen gradient. However, by exploiting the unique properties of the zebrafish embryo to capture the dynamics of signaling and cell fate allocation, we now demonstrate that Nodal functions in an incoherent feedforward loop, together with Fgf, to determine the pattern of endoderm and mesoderm specification. We show that Nodal induces long-range Fgf signaling while simultaneously inducing the cell-autonomous Fgf signaling inhibitor Dusp4 within the first two cell tiers from the margin. The consequent attenuation of Fgf signaling in these cells allows specification of endoderm progenitors, while the cells further from the margin, which receive Nodal and/or Fgf signaling, are specified as mesoderm. This elegant model demonstrates the necessity of feedforward and feedback interactions between multiple signaling pathways for providing cells with temporal and positional information.

Abstract: Summary
α-Synuclein (αSN) aggregation is central to the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Large-scale screening of compounds to identify aggregation inhibitors is challenged by stochastic αSN aggregation and difficulties in detecting early-stage oligomers (αSOs). We developed a high-throughput screening assay combining SDS-stimulated αSN aggregation with FRET to reproducibly detect initial stages in αSN aggregation. We screened 746,000 compounds, leading to 58 hits that markedly inhibit αSN aggregation and reduce αSOs’ membrane permeabilization activity. The most effective aggregation inhibitors were derivatives of (4-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)sulfonamide. They interacted strongly with the N-terminal part of monomeric αSN and reduced αSO-membrane interactions, possibly by affecting electrostatic interactions. Several compounds reduced αSO toxicity toward neuronal cell lines. The inhibitors introduced chemical modifications of αSN that were, however, not a prerequisite for inhibitory activity. We also identified several phenyl-benzoxazol compounds that promoted αSN aggregation (proaggregators). These compounds may be useful tools to modulate αSN aggregation in cellula.

Abstract: Skin is an extensive and easily accessible organ possessing various cell types that are constantly renewed. Previous studies have suggested the presence of a stem cell niche at the bulge region of the hair follicle, which contains cells positive for CD200 and CD34. Thus, this study sought to identify these cell populations in canine skin cells using the following methods 1- collecting samples of adult and fetal skin and isolating and culturing these cells using a method of simple enzymatic digestion and 2- testing the cell cultures for CD200 and CD34 in vitro and comparing them with skin tissue samples (in situ). Immunofluorescence results were negative for both CD200 and CD34 in frozen and paraffin embedded tissue, whereas the analysis showed that cultured cells positive for CD34, CD200 and double positive cells could be visualized in different percentages. Additionally, the pluripotency marker OCT4 was positive in the isolated cells. Analysis of CD34, CD200 and OCT4 by RT-qPCR showed that there is expression in fetal and adult cells, although no difference was observed between groups. Our results suggest that bulge stem cells from both fetuses and adult dogs were reported with the use of CD34 and CD200 markers in this study, and further techniques for cell isolation and in vitro cultivation are needed in order to obtain enriched populations of skin stem cells in dogs.

Abstract: Summary
Upon stimulation of cells with transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), Smad proteins form trimeric complexes and activate a broad spectrum of target genes. It remains unresolved which of the possible Smad complexes are formed in cellular contexts and how these contribute to gene expression. By combining quantitative mass spectrometry with a computational selection strategy, we predict and provide experimental evidence for the three most relevant Smad complexes in the mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa1-6. Utilizing dynamic pathway modeling, we specify the contribution of each Smad complex to the expression of representative Smad target genes, and show that these contributions are conserved in human hepatoma cell lines and primary hepatocytes. We predict, based on gene expression data of patient samples, increased amounts of Smad2/3/4 proteins and Smad2 phosphorylation as hallmarks of hepatocellular carcinoma and experimentally verify this prediction. Our findings demonstrate that modeling approaches can disentangle the complexity of transcription factor complex formation and its impact on gene expression.

Abstract: Freeze tolerance is an adaptive response utilized by the wood frog Rana sylvatica to endure the sub-zero temperatures of winter. Survival of whole body freezing requires wood frogs to trigger cryoprotective mechanisms to deal with potential injuries associated with conversion of 65–70% of total body water into ice, including multiple consequences of ice formation such as cessation of blood flow and cell dehydration caused by water loss into ice masses. To understand how wood frogs defend against these stressors, we measured the expression of proteins known to be involved in the antioxidant defense and protein chaperone stress responses in brain and heart of wood frogs comparing freezing, anoxia, and dehydration stress. Our results showed that most stress proteins were regulated in a tissue- and stress-specific manner. Notably, protein levels of the cytosolic superoxide dismutase (SOD1) were upregulated by 1.37 ± 0.11-fold in frozen brain, whereas the mitochondrial SOD2 isoform rose by 1.38 ± 0.37-fold in the heart during freezing. Catalase protein levels were upregulated by 3.01 ± 0.47-fold in the brain under anoxia stress, but remained unchanged in the heart. Similar context-specific regulatory patterns were also observed for the heat shock protein (Hsp) molecular chaperones. Hsp27 protein was down-regulated in the brain across the three stress conditions, whereas the mitochondrial Hsp60 was upregulated in anoxic brain by 1.73 ± 0.38-fold and by 2.13 ± 0.57-fold in the frozen heart. Overall, our study provides a snapshot of the regulatory expression of stress proteins in wood frogs under harsh environment conditions and shows that they are controlled in a tissue- and stress-specific manner.

Abstract: Summary
Colorectal cancer (CRC) tends to occur at older age; however, CRC incidence rates have been rising sharply among young age groups. The increasing prevalence of obesity is recognized as a major risk, yet the mechanistic underpinnings remain poorly understood. Using a diet-induced obesity mouse model, we identified obesity-associated molecular changes in the colonic epithelium of young and aged mice, and we further investigated whether the changes were reversed after weight loss. Transcriptome analysis indicated that obesity-related colonic cellular metabolic switch favoring long-chain fatty acid oxidation happened in young mice, while obesity-associated downregulation of negative feedback regulators of pro-proliferative signaling pathways occurred in older mice. Strikingly, colonic DNA methylome was pre-programmed by obesity at young age, priming for a tumor-prone gene signature after aging. Furthermore, obesity-related changes were substantially preserved after short-term weight loss, but they were largely reversed after long-term weight loss. We provided mechanistic insights into increased CRC risk in obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Consistent with its location on the ribosome, reporter assays demonstrate a role for Rps26 in recognition of the Kozak sequence. Consequently, Rps26-deficient ribosomes display preference for mRNAs encoding components of the high salt and high pH stress response pathways and accumulate in yeast exposed to high salt or pH. Here we use this information to reprogram the cellular response to high salt by introducing point mutations in the Kozak sequence of key regulators for the cell wall MAP-kinase, filamentation, or DNA repair pathways. This stimulates their translation upon genetic, or salt-induced Rps26 depletion from ribosomes. Stress resistance assays show activation of the targeted pathways in an Rps26- and salt-dependent manner. Genomic alterations in diverse yeast populations indicate that analogous tuning occurs during adaptation to ecological niches. Thus, evolution shapes translational control across the genome by taking advantage of the accumulation of diverse ribosome populations.

Abstract: Summary
Treatment involving regenerative medicine for chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) is difficult due to phase-dependent changes in the intraspinal environment. We previously reported that treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI), which inhibits Notch signaling, promotes the differentiation into mature neurons in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem/progenitor cell (hiPSC-NS/PC) transplantation for subacute SCI. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of GSI-treated hiPSC-NS/PC transplantation in treating chronic SCI, which resulted in significantly enhanced axonal regrowth, remyelination, inhibitory synapse formation with the host neural circuitry, and reticulo spinal tract fiber formation. Interestingly, inhibiting Notch signaling with GSI caused phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which is a key molecule required to promote axonal regeneration. These favorable outcomes contributed to motor function improvement. Therefore, treating cells with GSI provides a beneficial effect after transplantation, even in the chronic phase following SCI.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying reliable drug response biomarkers is a significant challenge in cancer research. We present computational analysis of resistance (CARE), a computational method focused on targeted therapies, to infer genome-wide transcriptomic signatures of drug efficacy from cell line compound screens. CARE outputs genome-scale scores to measure how the drug target gene interacts with other genes to affect the inhibitor efficacy in the compound screens. Such statistical interactions between drug targets and other genes were not considered in previous studies but are critical in identifying predictive biomarkers. When evaluated using transcriptome data from clinical studies, CARE can predict the therapy outcome better than signatures from other computational methods and genomics experiments. Moreover, the CARE signatures for the PLX4720 BRAF inhibitor are associated with an anti-programmed death 1 clinical response, suggesting a common efficacy signature between a targeted therapy and immunotherapy. When searching for genes related to lapatinib resistance, CARE identified PRKD3 as the top candidate. PRKD3 inhibition, by both small interfering RNA and compounds, significantly sensitized breast cancer cells to lapatinib. Thus, CARE should enable large-scale inference of response biomarkers and drug combinations for targeted therapies using compound screen data.

Abstract: Transcription activator proteins are regulatory proteins that bind to the promoter regions of target genes. Transcription activator protein-1 (AP-1) regulates numerous genes related to the immune system, apoptosis, and proliferation. In this study, the full-length cDNA of AP-1 from Portunus trituberculatus (PtAP-1) was identified by expressed sequence tag analysis and cDNA-end rapid amplification. The gene is 1183 bp and encodes a 256-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass and isoelectric point of 28.96 kDa and 8.90, respectively. PtAP-1 showed the highest expression level in the gonad tissue and the lowest expression level in blood, hemocyte, muscle, hepatopancreas, and gill, during the first 6 h of low-salinity stimulation (10%). Additionally, we observed steady decreases in PtAP-1 mRNA expression in the gill, but at 12 h, expression was initially upregulated, followed by a significant decrease until restoration to baseline levels at 48 h. Additionally, Vibrio alginolyticus challenge resulted in significant upregulation of PtAP-1 expression in the first 6 h, which was maintained at high levels for 48 h. From 48 to 72 h, we observed decreases in PtAP-1 levels, although they remained significantly higher than those detected at baseline. These results suggested that PtAP-1 is involved in the immune response and osmoregulation of crustaceans.

Abstract: Summary
Several studies have reported an association between the farnesoid X receptor alpha (FXRα) and estrogenic signaling pathways. Fxrα could thus be involved in the reprotoxic effects of endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol-A (BPA). To test this hypothesis, mice were exposed to BPA and/or stigmasterol (S), an FXRα antagonist. Following the exposure to both molecules, wild-type animals showed impaired fertility and lower sperm cell production associated with the alteration of the establishment and maintenance of the undifferentiated germ cell pool. The crosstalk between BPA and FXRα is further supported by the lower impact of BPA in mice genetically ablated for Fxrα and the fact that BPA counteracted the effects of FXRα agonists. These effects might result from the downregulation of Fxrα expression following BPA exposure. BPA and S act additively in human testis. Our data demonstrate that FXRα activity modulates the impact of BPA on male gonads and on undifferentiated germ cell population.

Abstract: Summary
Conventional RNA interference (RNAi) pathways suppress eukaryotic gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. At the core of RNAi are small RNAs (sRNAs) and effector Argonaute (AGO) proteins. Arabidopsis AGO1 is known to bind microRNAs (miRNAs) and post-transcriptionally repress target genes in the cytoplasm. Here, we report that AGO1 also binds to the chromatin of active genes and promotes their transcription. We show that sRNAs and SWI/SNF complexes associate with nuclear AGO1 and are required for AGO1 binding to chromatin. Moreover, we show that various stimuli, including plant hormones and stresses, specifically trigger AGO1 binding to stimulus-responsive genes. Finally, we show that AGO1 facilitates the induction of genes in jasmonate (JA) signaling pathways and the activation of JA responses. Our findings suggest that, by binding and facilitating the expression of stimuli-specific genes, AGO1 may regulate diverse signaling pathways and associated biological processes.

Abstract: The TIS21/BTG2/PC3 gene belongs to the antiproliferative gene (APRO) family and exhibits tumor suppressive activity. However, here we report that TIS21 controls lipid metabolism, rather than cell proliferation, under fasting condition. Using microarray analysis, whole gene expression changes were investigated in liver of TIS21 knockout (TIS21-KO) mice after 20 h fasting and compared with wild type (WT). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) target gene expression was almost absent in contrast to increased lipid synthesis in the TIS21-KO mice compared to WT mice. Immunohistochemistry with hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that lipid deposition was focal in the TIS21-KO liver as opposed to the diffuse and homogeneous pattern in the WT liver after 24 h starvation. In addition, cathepsin E expression was over 10 times higher in the TIS21-KO liver than that in the WT, as opposed to the significant reduction of thioltransferase in both adult and fetal livers. At present, we cannot account for the role of cathepsin E. However, downregulation of glutaredoxin 2 thioltransferase expression might affect hypoxic damage in the TIS21-KO liver. We suggest that the TIS21/BTG2 gene might be essential to maintain energy metabolism and reducing power in the liver under fasting condition.

Abstract: Summary
Peripheral nerve injury can induce pathological conditions that lead to persistent sensitized nociception. Although there is evidence that plastic changes in the cortex contribute to this process, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we find that activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) induced by peripheral nerve injury increases the turnover of specific synaptic proteins in a persistent manner. We demonstrate that neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) is one of the molecules involved and show that it mediates spine reorganization and contributes to the behavioral sensitization. We show striking parallels in the underlying mechanism with the maintenance of NMDA-receptor- and protein-synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the ACC. Our results, therefore, demonstrate a synaptic mechanism for cortical reorganization and suggest potential avenues for neuropathic pain treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Modulation of neuronal circuits is key to information processing in the brain. The majority of neuromodulators exert their effects by activating G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that control the production of second messengers directly impacting cellular physiology. How numerous GPCRs integrate neuromodulatory inputs while accommodating diversity of incoming signals is poorly understood. In this study, we develop an in vivo tool and analytical suite for analyzing GPCR responses by monitoring the dynamics of a key second messenger, cyclic AMP (cAMP), with excellent quantitative and spatiotemporal resolution in various neurons. Using this imaging approach in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 editing and optogenetics, we interrogate neuromodulatory mechanisms of defined populations of neurons in an intact mesolimbic reward circuit and describe how individual inputs generate discrete second-messenger signatures in a cell- and receptor-specific fashion. This offers a resource for studying native neuronal GPCR signaling in real time.

Abstract: Heat stress affects milk yield and quality in lactating dairy cows in summer. Bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs) play a key role in milk secretion, and microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate numerous functions of bMEC. Previous reports have verified that miR-216b regulated cell apoptosis through repressing target genes in several cancer cells. So, our purpose was to explore the potential involvement of miR-216b in heat stress-induced cell apoptosis in bMECs. Firstly, the heat stress model was constructed and we found that apoptotic rates of bMECs significantly increased under heat stress. The expression of miR-216b, Bax mRNA, and caspase-3 mRNA was upregulated. However, Bcl-2 mRNA level was detected to differentially downregulated. Overexpression of miR-216b remarkably downregulated the expression of caspase-3 and Bax mRNA and protein, and the mRNA and protein level of Bcl-2 was increased. Inhibition of miR-216b increased the activity of caspase-3 and Bax, and the level of Bcl-2 was inhibited. Moreover, Fas was identified as a target gene of miR-216b through bioinformatic analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Fas activity was significantly inhibited and enhanced respectively after transfecting miRNA mimics and inhibitor. Finally, inhibition of Fas via the small interfering RNA (siRNA) also inhibited cell apoptosis induced by heat stress. Taken together, our results indicated that miR-216b exerted as an anti-apoptotic effect under heat stress in bMECs by targeting Fas.

Abstract: Summary
Ring1-YY1-binding protein (RYBP) is a member of the non-canonical polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), and like other PRC1 members, it is best described as a transcriptional regulator. However, several PRC1 members were recently shown to function in DNA repair. Here, we report that RYBP preferentially binds K63-ubiquitin chains via its Npl4 zinc finger (NZF) domain. Since K63-linked ubiquitin chains are assembled at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), we examined the contribution of RYBP to DSB repair. Surprisingly, we find that RYBP is K48 polyubiquitylated by RNF8 and rapidly removed from chromatin upon DNA damage by the VCP/p97 segregase. High expression of RYBP competitively inhibits recruitment of BRCA1 repair complex to DSBs, reducing DNA end resection and homologous recombination (HR) repair. Moreover, breast cancer cell lines expressing high endogenous RYBP levels show increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition. These data suggest that RYBP negatively regulates HR repair by competing for K63-ubiquitin chain binding.

Abstract: Summary
How mtDNA replication is terminated and the newly formed genomes are separated remain unknown. We here demonstrate that the mitochondrial isoform of topoisomerase 3α (Top3α) fulfills this function, acting independently of its nuclear role as a component of the Holliday junction-resolving BLM-Top3α-RMI1-RMI2 (BTR) complex. Our data indicate that mtDNA replication termination occurs via a hemicatenane formed at the origin of H-strand replication and that Top3α is essential for resolving this structure. Decatenation is a prerequisite for separation of the segregating unit of mtDNA, the nucleoid, within the mitochondrial network. The importance of this process is highlighted in a patient with mitochondrial disease caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in TOP3A, characterized by muscle-restricted mtDNA deletions and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) plus syndrome. Our work establishes Top3α as an essential component of the mtDNA replication machinery and as the first component of the mtDNA separation machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic neuropathic pain is a major morbidity of neural injury, yet its mechanisms are incompletely understood. Hypersensitivity to previously non-noxious stimuli (allodynia) is a common symptom. Here, we demonstrate that the onset of cold hypersensitivity precedes tactile allodynia in a model of partial nerve injury, and this temporal divergence was associated with major differences in global gene expression in innervating dorsal root ganglia. Transcripts whose expression change correlates with the onset of cold allodynia were nociceptor related, whereas those correlating with tactile hypersensitivity were immune cell centric. Ablation of TrpV1 lineage nociceptors resulted in mice that did not acquire cold allodynia but developed normal tactile hypersensitivity, whereas depletion of macrophages or T cells reduced neuropathic tactile allodynia but not cold hypersensitivity. We conclude that neuropathic pain incorporates reactive processes of sensory neurons and immune cells, each leading to distinct forms of hypersensitivity, potentially allowing drug development targeted to each pain type.

Abstract: Summary
Adult muscle stem cells (satellite cells) are required for adult skeletal muscle regeneration. A proper balance between quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation is essential for the maintenance of the satellite cell pool and their regenerative function. Although the ubiquitin-proteasome is required for most protein degradation in mammalian cells, how its dysfunction affects tissue stem cells remains unclear. Here, we investigated the function of the proteasome in satellite cells using mice lacking the crucial proteasomal component, Rpt3. Ablation of Rpt3 in satellite cells decreased proteasome activity. Proteasome dysfunction in Rpt3-deficient satellite cells impaired their ability to proliferate, survive and differentiate, resulting in defective muscle regeneration. We found that inactivation of proteasomal activity induced proliferation defects and apoptosis in satellite cells. Mechanistically, insufficient proteasomal activity upregulated the p53 pathway, which caused cell-cycle arrest. Our findings delineate a critical function of the proteasome system in maintaining satellite cells in adult muscle.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) is an adaptor of the innate immune receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) that links recognition of viral RNA to antiviral signaling. Upon interacting with RIG-I, MAVS undergoes lysine 63-linked poly-ubiquitination by the E3 ligase TRIM31 and subsequently aggregates to activate downstream signaling effectors. We find that the scaffold protein FAF1 forms aggregates that negatively regulate MAVS. FAF1 antagonizes the poly-ubiquitination and aggregation of MAVS by competing with TRIM31 for MAVS association. FAF1 knockout mice are more resistant to RNA virus infection, and FAF1 deficiency in myeloid cells results in enhanced innate signaling and reduced viral load and morbidity in vivo. Upon virus infection, the kinase IKKɛ directly phosphorylates FAF1 at Ser556 and triggers FAF1 de-aggregation. Moreover, Ser556 phosphorylation promotes FAF1 lysosomal degradation, consequently relieving FAF1-dependent suppression of MAVS. These findings establish FAF1 as a modulator of MAVS and uncover mechanisms that regulate FAF1 to insure timely activation of antiviral defense.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic reprogramming, which was first identified in rodents, remains poorly described in non-mammalian species. Here, we generated avian reprogrammed cells by reprogramming of chicken and duck primary embryonic fibroblasts. The efficient generation of long-term proliferating cells depends on the method of delivery of reprogramming factors and the addition of NANOG and LIN28 to the canonical OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC gene combination. The reprogrammed cells were positive for several key pluripotency-associated markers including alkaline phosphatase activity, telomerase activity, SSEA1 expression, and specific cell cycle and epigenetic markers. Upregulated endogenous pluripotency-associated genes included POU5F3 (POUV) and KLF4, whereas cells failed to upregulate NANOG and LIN28A. However, cells showed a tumorigenic propensity when injected into recipient embryos. In conclusion, although the somatic reprogramming process is active in avian primary cells, it needs to be optimized to obtain fully reprogrammed cells with similar properties to those of chicken embryonic stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have established important roles of de novo mutations (DNMs) in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Here, we analyze DNMs in 262 ASD probands of Japanese origin and confirm the “de novo paradigm” of ASDs across ethnicities. Based on this consistency, we combine the lists of damaging DNMs in our and published ASD cohorts (total number of trios, 4,244) and perform integrative bioinformatics analyses. Besides replicating the findings of previous studies, our analyses highlight ATP-binding genes and fetal cerebellar/striatal circuits. Analysis of individual genes identified 61 genes enriched for damaging DNMs, including ten genes for which our dataset now contributes to statistical significance. Screening of compounds altering the expression of genes hit by damaging DNMs reveals a global downregulating effect of valproic acid, a known risk factor for ASDs, whereas cardiac glycosides upregulate these genes. Collectively, our integrative approach provides deeper biological and potential medical insights into ASDs.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial patterns are recognized by cell-surface receptors to initiate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in plants. Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs), such as BIK1, and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are engaged during PTI to activate the NADPH oxidase RBOHD for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. It is unknown whether protein kinases besides CPKs and RLCKs participate in RBOHD regulation. We screened mutants in all ten Arabidopsis MAP4 kinases (MAP4Ks) and identified the conserved MAP4K SIK1 as a positive regulator of PTI. sik1 mutants were compromised in their ability to elicit the ROS burst in response to microbial features and exhibited compromised PTI to bacterial infection. SIK1 directly interacts with, phosphorylates, and stabilizes BIK1 in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, SIK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates RBOHD upon flagellin perception. Thus, SIK1 positively regulates immunity by stabilizing BIK1 and activating RBOHD to promote the extracellular ROS burst.

Abstract: Molecular chaperones are a diverse group of proteins that ensure proteome integrity by helping the proteins fold correctly and maintain their native state, thus preventing their misfolding and subsequent aggregation. The chaperone machinery of archaeal organisms has been thought to closely resemble that found in humans, at least in terms of constituent players. Very few studies have been ventured into system-level analysis of chaperones and their functioning in archaeal cells. In this study, we attempted such an analysis of chaperone-assisted protein folding in archaeal organisms through network approach using Picrophilus torridus as model system. The study revealed that DnaK protein of Hsp70 system acts as hub in protein-protein interaction network. However, DnaK protein was present only in a subset of archaeal organisms and absent from many archaea, especially members of Crenarchaeota phylum. Therefore, a similar network was created for another archaeal organism, Sulfolobus solfataricus, a member of Crenarchaeota. The chaperone network of S. solfataricus suggested that thermosomes played an integral part of hub proteins in archaeal organisms, where DnaK was absent. We further compared the chaperone network of archaea with that found in eukaryotic systems, by creating a similar network for Homo sapiens. In the human chaperone network, the UBC protein, a part of ubiquitination system, was the most important module, and interestingly, this system is known to be absent in archaeal organisms. Comprehensive comparison of these networks leads to several interesting conclusions regarding similarities and differences within archaeal chaperone machinery in comparison to humans.

Abstract: Lactate produced by Sertoli cells plays an important role in spermatogenesis, and heat stress induces lactate production in immature boar Sertoli cells. Extracellular signaling regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) participates in heat stress response. However, the effect of ERK1/2 on heat stress-induced lactate production is unclear. In the present study, Sertoli cells were isolated from immature boar testis and cultured at 32 °C. Heat stress was induced in a 43°C incubator for 30 min. Proteins and RNAs were detected by western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. Lactate production and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity were detected using commercial kits. Heat stress promoted ERK1/2 phosphorylation, showing a reducing trend with increasing recovery time. In addition, heat stress increased heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expressions, enhanced LDH activity and lactate production at 2-h post-heat stress. Pretreatment with U0126 (1 × 10−6 mol/L), a highly selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, reduced HSP70, GLUT3, and LDHA expressions and decreased LDH activity and lactate production. Meanwhile, ERK2 siRNA1 reduced the mRNA level of ERK2 and weakened ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Additionally, ERK2 siRNA1 reduced HSP70, GLUT3, and LHDA expressions decreased LDH activity and lactate production. Furthermore, HSP70 siRNA3 downregulated GLUT3 and LDHA expressions and decreased LDH activity and lactate production. These results show that activated ERK1/2 increases heat stress-induced lactate production by enhancing HSP70 expression to promote the expressions of molecules related to lactate production (GLUT3 and LDHA). Our study reveals a new insight in reducing the negative effect of heat stress in boars.

Abstract: Limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs) are believed to be responsible for corneal epithelial maintenance and repair after injury, but their activity has never been properly quantified in aging or wounded eyes. In this study, labelling with thymidine analogues, 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (IdU), 5-chloro-2′-deoxyuridine (CldU) and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU), was used to estimate cell-cycle time of the corneal and limbal epithelia in wild-type eyes, comparing aging (12 months) and young adult (8 week) mice. In C57BL/6 mice, cells cycled significantly faster in the central corneal epithelium of aging eyes (3.24 ± 0.2 days) compared to 10 week old mice (4.97 ± 0.5 days). Long-term labelling with IdU was used to detect slow-cycling stem cells, followed by CldU or EdU labelling to quantify the proliferative dynamics of LESCs during corneal wound healing. In unwounded eyes, 4.52 ± 1.4% of LESCs were shown to enter S phase in a 24 h period and were estimated to divide every 2–3 weeks. Within 24 h of corneal injury this rose significantly to 32.8 ± 10.0% of stem cells indicating a seven-fold increase in activation. In contrast, no comparable increase in LESC activation was observed in aging mice after wounding. In the 24–48 h period after wounding in young adults, LESC activation continued to increase (86.5 ± 8.2% of label-retaining cells in wounded eye were in S-phase) but surprisingly, 46.0 ± 9.4% of LESCs were observed to reenter S-phase in the contralateral unwounded eye. These data imply an unsuspected systemic effect of corneal wounding on LESC activation suggesting that injury to one eye elicits a regenerative response in both.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) is a highly conserved chaperone molecule that plays important roles in mediating some physiological and pathological functions. However, researchers have not yet determined whether HSP60 is expressed in the mammalian cochlea. This study constitutes the first investigation of the expression of HSP60 in the postnatal rat cochlea. We also examined the expression of HSP60 in rats with drug-induced hearing loss. Auditory thresholds were assessed by monitoring the auditory brainstem response (ABR) prior to and after drug injection. Expression levels of the HSP60 gene (Hsp60) and HSP60 protein in the rat cochlea were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. The distribution of HSP60 in the rat cochlea was further examined by immunofluorescence staining. We have demonstrated that HSP60 was expressed in the postnatal rat cochlea in an age-dependent and cell-specific manner. In addition, after drug exposure, the average hearing threshold of rats in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group, with increased HSP60 expression level in response to kanamycin and furosemide treatments. HSP60 expression was observed in the supporting cells (SCs) within the organ of Corti in both the uninjured and the injured cochlea, but it was undetectable in the mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) and spiral ganglion neurons. Therefore, our research suggests that HSP60 may play an important role in auditory function.

Abstract: Summary
Depolarization of neuroendocrine cells results in calcium influx, which induces vesicle exocytosis and alters gene expression. These processes, along with the restoration of resting membrane potential, are energy intensive. We hypothesized that cellular mechanisms exist to maximize energy production during excitation. Here, we demonstrate that NPAS4, an immediate early basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS transcription factor, acts to maximize energy production by suppressing hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). As such, knockout of Npas4 from insulin-producing β cells results in reduced OXPHOS, loss of insulin secretion, β cell dedifferentiation, and type 2 diabetes. NPAS4 plays a similar role in the nutrient-sensing cells of the hypothalamus. Its knockout here results in increased food intake, reduced locomotor activity, and elevated peripheral glucose production. In conclusion, NPAS4 is critical for the coordination of metabolism during the stimulation of electrically excitable cells; its loss leads to the defects in cellular metabolism that underlie the cellular dysfunction that occurs in metabolic disease.
