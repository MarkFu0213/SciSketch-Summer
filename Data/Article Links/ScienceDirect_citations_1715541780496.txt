Abstract: In this paper, we present a study on cadmium selenide (CdSe) quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) in terms of the evaluation of carrier transport and recombinations using intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS). Using the obtained data through this evaluation, we calculated the electron transport time (τsc), electron recombination lifetimes (τoc), effective diffusion constants (Deff), and diffusion lengths (Ln). The QDSSC used in this study show improved fill factors (FF) of ∼60% with a polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−) redox mediator and Pt counter electrode. This result is ascribed to the low series resistances (Rs) of QDSSC that are accessed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In addition, the present study provides information on the sensitization mode of CdSe QDs on TiO2 electrodes, achieved by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with EDS imaging.

Abstract: ZnO single-crystalline nanowires (NWs) are highly relevant 1D-nanostructures for efficient charge collection in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In a first part of the paper, ZnO-NWs have been grown by electrochemistry on various fluorine-doped transparent oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. The effects of substrate treatments and of the presence of an underlayer of TiO2 or ZnO on the cell performance are reported. In particular, we show that the presence of a TiO2 underlayer gives rise to a dense array of ZnO-NWs with a high aspect ratio (>30) and to the cells with the best performances. However, the roughness of the NW arrayed films were not sufficient for the efficient harvesting of sunlight and low fill factors were found. In a second step, hierarchical structures have been designed by growing electrochemically a secondary nanoporous epitaxial ZnO phase on the wire surface. We have found that the cell performances were significantly improved in that case due to a much larger specific surface area and to a much better fill factor. We also show that the cell efficiencies of hierarchical structures did not follow the performances of the starting ZnO-NWs. The volume occupied by the second phase, its thickness and its connection to the wires are important parameters for cell optimizing.

Abstract: In an organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell, the buffer layers connecting the active photovoltaic material to the electrodes strongly influence the overall energy conversion efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that a thin layer (<4nm) of MoO3 formed by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Mo, followed by oxidation in ozone, performs well as an anode buffer layer in organic photovoltaic cells based on a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester. Compared to the commonly used buffer layer poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), the MoO3 layer causes virtually no degradation in the transmission spectrum. The improvement in optical transmission leads to higher short-circuit current density, and practically the same power conversion efficiency as OPV cells employing PEDOT:PSS. Results from a substantial number of devices indicate that the improvement is statistically significant, demonstrating the reproducibility and reliability of the layer. Moreover, because of the conformal nature of ALD, this approach can be extended to nanostructured systems.

Abstract: Hsp27, αB-crystallin and HSP22 are ubiquitous small heat shock proteins (sHsp) whose expression is induced in response to a wide variety of unfavorable physiological and environmental conditions. These sHsp protect cells from otherwise lethal conditions mainly by their involvement in cell death pathways such as necrosis, apoptosis or autophagy. At a molecular level, the mechanisms accounting for sHsp functions in cell death are (1) prevention of denatured proteins aggregation, (2) regulation of caspase activity, (3) regulation of the intracellular redox state, (4) function in actin polymerization and cytoskeleton integrity and (5) proteasome-mediated degradation of selected proteins. In cancer cells, these sHsp are often overexpressed and associated with increased tumorigenicity, cancer cells metastatic potential and resistance to chemotherapy. Altogether, these properties suggest that Hsp27, αB-crystallin and Hsp22 are appropriate targets for modulating cell death pathways. In the present, we briefly review recent reports showing molecular evidence of cell death regulation by these sHsp and co-chaperones. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Small HSPs in physiology and pathology.

Abstract: Self-association of a protein to form dimer and oligomer is a general theme in biological control mechanism, and is increasingly understood to be an important step in many cellular processes, including signaling transduction, protein degradation and transcriptional regulation. Previously, we cloned and functionally characterized a gene encoded for ZIP (zinc finger and G-patch domain-containing protein). We showed that ZIP is a novel transcription repressor that regulates, through recruitment of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, a collection of functionally important genes including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) oncogene. The important role ZIP plays in controlling cell proliferation and carcinogenesis highlights the need for a detailed understanding of the finely mechanisms by which ZIP is regulated. Here, we report that ZIP forms homodimers in vitro and in vivo through its C-terminal domains. We demonstrated that ZIP dimerization promotes its transcriptional repressive activity and is essential for its DNA binding. We showed that enforced dimerization of ZIP suppresses EGFR expression, leading to the delay of cell cycle progression and the inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation. Thus, our results revealed that dimerization is crucial for is transcriptional repressive function and biological activity and provided a finely tuned means for the regulation the expression of EGFR oncogene. These may shed new light on the EGFR-related breast carcinogenesis and offer a potential new target for breast cancer therapy.

Abstract: The present article evaluates the influence of the experimental conditions in the determination of the subcooling of sodium sulfate decahydrate (Glauber's salt) nucleated with anhydrous and hydrated sodium tetraborate (borax). Experiments have been carried out by means of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and by two other custom experimental procedures designed by the authors, in order to ensure that, the small samples tested in the DSC and the large samples tested using those experimental techniques, undergo the same or equivalent thermal processes. Two types of samples have been evaluated, the first one composed of sodium sulfate decahydrate nucleated with 5% sodium tetraborate decahydrate, and the second one being 32.3% anhydrous sodium sulfate, 1.4% anhydrous sodium tetraborate, and the balance water. The influence in the determination of the subcooling of experimental conditions such as the cooling rate, the maximum heating temperature, and the holding time at the maximum temperature has been researched. The results indicate that the mass/temperature/time variables have a complex interaction in the subcooling attained. As a result, the DSC technique underestimates the reduction of subcooling that can be attained in large masses of Glauber's salt by nucleation with borax.

A non-covalent interaction between small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 and Zac1 regulates Zac1 cellular functions,

Abstract: Zac1, a zinc-finger protein that regulates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest 1, such as p53, can induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. The transactivation and coactivation functions of Zac1 may occur at non-promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB) sites in the presence of other PML-NB components, including ubiquitin-conjugating 9 (Ubc9). It is unclear whether post-translational modification of Zac1 by the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO plays a role in the coactivation functions of Zac1 for the regulation of the p21 gene. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that the two SUMO-binding lysine residues of Zac1, K237 and K424, repress the transactivation activity of Zac1. Studies using a SUMO-1 C-terminal di-glycine motif mutant that is deficient in the ability to form covalent bonds with lysines, SUMO-1 (GA), and a dominant-negative Ubc9 construct (C93S) indicated that SUMO-1 might regulate Zac1 transactivation and coactivation via a non-covalent interaction. Unlike the wild-type Zac1, which induced apoptosis, the Zac1 (K237/424R) double mutant had the ability to induce autophagy. The functional role of p21 remains to be investigated. SUMO-1 selectively suppressed the induction of the p21 gene and protein by wild-type Zac1 but not by the Zac1 (K237/424R) double mutant. Moreover, wild-type Ubc9 but not Ubc9 (C93S) further potentiated the suppression of SUMO-1 in all Zac1-induced p21 promoter activities. Our data reveal that p21 may be an important factor for the prevention of Zac1-induced apoptosis without affecting autophagosome formation. This work indicates that Zac1 functions are regulated, at least in part, via non-covalent interactions with SUMO-1 for the induction of p21, which is important for the modulation of apoptosis.

Abstract: Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are strongly implicated in carcinogenesis, but their specific roles in the major cancers have yet to be fully elucidated.
Methods
The expression levels of miR-139 in colorectal carcinoma and paired normal tissues were examined using real-time PCR assays. Potential functions of miR-139 were evaluated in colorectal carcinoma cell lines (SW480, SW620, LS174 T, and HCT116) using miR-139 mimics, anti-miR-139, and siRNA RAP1B.
Results
In this study, we determined that miR-139 is down-regulated in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) tissues. Lower miR-139 expression correlates with more advanced CRC and lower overall survival of patients with CRC. The ectopic expression of miR-139 in human CRC cells decreased cell growth and tumorigenicity, whereas the silencing of miR-139 promoted cell growth. Mechanistic studies revealed that miR-139 repressed the activity of a reporter gene fused to the 3′-untranslated region of RAP1B, whereas miR-139 silencing up-regulated the expression of the reporter gene. RNAi-mediated knockdown of RAP1B phenocopied the antiproliferative effect of miR-139, whereas the overexpression of RAP1B blocked miR-139-mediated antiproliferative effects in CRC cells.
Conclusions
Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-139 decreases proliferation by directly targeting RAP1B, defining miR-139 as a new putative tumour suppressor miRNA in CRC.

The intramolecular charge transfers of these materials were effectively appeared in between bisDMFABT donor and acceptors, depending on the electron-withdrawing strength of acceptors. The organic semiconductor having DCBF acceptor exhibited the best power conversion efficiency of 3.22% with short circuit current of 9.64mA/cm2, fill fator of 0.42, and open circuit voltage of 0.80V in SMOSC devices with TiOx thin layer.

Abstract: This paper presents the experimental validation of a new five-parameter model capable of analytically describing the I–V characteristic of a silicon photovoltaic module for each generic condition of operative temperature and solar irradiance. The operating current calculated with the model was validated on the basis of a series of experimental measurements performed in the field on two commercial silicon photovoltaic panels connected to a set of nine constant values of the electrical load. In order to examine the panels working in almost steady-state conditions only the data-sets of the sunniest days from sunrise to sunset were used. Unfortunately the production spread of photovoltaic panels did not permit the consistent comparison between the measurements and the data calculated by the model on the basis of the electrical characteristics provided by the manufactures. To surmount such an obstacle the determination of the particular current–voltage characteristic of the tested photovoltaic panel specimens was successfully attempted by filtering the collected data. The results of comparison have shown that the model defined by the new electrical characteristics is able to evaluate the operating current with a high degree of accuracy, even during days perturbed by very variable conditions of solar irradiance.

Abstract: In this study we have investigated two multicrystalline silicon ingots made from a compensated solar grade silicon (SoG-Si) test feedstock. Both ingots were solidified under the same conditions in a pilot-scale directional solidification furnace. In order to study the distribution and the impact of Cr in the compensated SoG-Si feedstock, 50ppmw Cr (27ppma) was added to one of the ingots. Electrical properties, such as resistivity and minority carrier lifetime, have been compared for the two ingots. Solar cells performance is also presented. The minority carrier lifetime is significantly reduced by the addition of Cr, being up to 19μs for the undoped reference ingot, and <1μs for the Cr-doped material. The maximum solar cell conversion efficiency of the solar cells made from the Cr-doped compensated solar grade silicon in this study is 14.4%, which is similar to the cells made from the ingot with no Cr addition. This work shows that Cr contamination significantly impairs electrical properties but they can, to some degree, be improved by gettering during solar cell processing.

Abstract: We demonstrate high-performance polymer tandem devices (PTDs) combining solar cell (SC) and light-emitting diode (LED), which are fabricated using solution-based techniques for each layer with the use of semiconducting and metallic polymers. The PTD has three terminals—two outer electrodes and an internal common electrode—and functions as a SC and a LED. In the SC mode, the PTD exhibits a reasonable power conversion efficiency of 3.1% under AM 1.5 irradiation conditions, whereas the device functions as a LED with a luminance of 8000cd/m2 when applying external bias voltages. A sol–gel processed titanium sub-oxide (TiOx) is efficiently used in the PTDs for carrier transport toward the target electrode.

Abstract: A high performance and cost effective polyaniline doped with camphorsulfonic acid (PANI:CSA) based thin film was prepared for a flexible electrode. A high crystalline structure was introduced to prevent the decreased orientation of PANI film to overcome a conductivity dropping with decreasing film thickness because of the recoiling of the polymer chains. An optimum structure is selected according to the various analyses such as self-assembled degree, crystallinity, and the blending properties with PANI. The additive, named self-assembly supramolecules (SAS), was successfully blended with PANI chains. PANI film blended with the most suitable SAS (PANI:CSA/SAS18) exhibited high conductivity of 843S/cm and a high optical transparency of 86% at 550nm that was thinner than 200nm of film thickness. The flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) device adapted to our electrode shows a higher power conversion efficiency of 1.73% than a pristine PANI:CSA electrode at 0.40%. Furthermore, it was possible to induce long environmental stability under numerous device operating cycles since PANI:CSA/SAS18 had a lower acidity compared with the PEDOT:PSS conventional polymer electrode. The efficiency of our OSC device remains more than 90% after 500h, while that of OSC device made of PEDOT:PSS decreased approximately 30% of their initial efficiency after 500h. The PANI based OSCs electrode developed in this study has the potential for consideration as a novel polymer electrode in a flexible display.

Abstract: This work investigates the stability of platinum (Pt) electrodes prepared by electrodeposition and thermal decomposition of hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) solutions. To this aim, the electrodes were stored in an electrolyte solution (0.5M KI, 0.05M I2 in 90%/10% PC/EG) or in air, within a closed vessel, for up to 70 days. A drop of up to 40% in the current density for triiodide reduction was caused by storage in the electrolyte solution and of about 15%–20% when the electrodes were stored in air. Electrolyte storage was found to cause a 40% increase in the activation energy of both kinds of electrodes. XPS measurements have shown that the main degradation mechanism in the case of electrolyte storage is the dissolution of Pt from the substrate. Regeneration of the electrodes by heat or acid treatment was not possible. The observed electrode degradation is expected to appear in dye sensitized solar cells using this kind of counter electrodes and thus affect their long term stability.

Abstract: The minority-carrier lifetime in p-type solar-grade silicon (SoG-Si) produced by Elkem Solar was investigated after different types of heat treatment. Two groups of samples differing by the as-grown lifetimes were exposed to internal and phosphorus gettering using constant and variable temperature processes. Optimal heat-treatment parameters for each group of samples were then identified which improved the minority-carrier lifetimes to values higher than the minimum value needed for solar cells. Phosphorus gettering using a variable temperature process enhanced in particular the lifetime within each group, increasing in certain cases the lifetime from 3 up to 81μs.

Abstract: For high efficiencies, organic solar cells have to harvest a large part of the solar spectrum. However, in particular for small molecule based cells, efficient infrared absorbers are still rare. We investigate here two aza-bodipy dyes which have promising properties. Upon benzannulation of the pyrrole of difluoro-bora-1,3,5,7-tetraphenyl-aza-dipyrromethene (Ph4-bodipy), the thin film absorption maximum is shifted by about 70–773nm compared to the non-annulated molecule. The thin film properties of both materials are investigated and vacuum-processed solar cells using a mip-architecture (metal intrinsic p-doped) are compared. With the new benzannulated difluoro-bora-bis-(1-phenyl-indoyl)-azamethine (Ph2-benz-bodipy) as donor material, these planar heterojunction solar cells show an open-circuit voltage of 0.65V, a fill factor of 65%, and an external quantum efficiency extending up to 860nm. The mismatch corrected power conversion efficiency reaches 1.1%.

Abstract: A study of plasmonic phenomena produced by silver nanoparticles embedded in a photoactive (poly-3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) bulk heterojunction is performed via spectrophotometric and Raman characterizations. An enhanced absorption of light is experimentally obtained in a 90nm-thick P3HT:PCBM interpenetrated blend layer incorporating evaporated 5nm-thick silver nanoparticles on glass/ITO substrate. An increase of Raman signal is observed and correlated to an increase of the electromagnetic field close to metallic nanoparticles. This is confirmed by Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) modeling considering an organized 2D-grating of ellipsoidal domes. This paper shows also that the use of relatively thick organic blend films as probe molecules upon plasmonic structures does not obscure the Raman response.

Abstract: We present a new technique to measure component current–voltage (I–V) curves of individual sub-cells integrated in a monolithic multi-junction solar cell. This new approach, compared to all previously reported ones, is well suited for thin-film silicon p–i–n structures where the so-called shifting approximation, which supposes that illumination only shifts the I–V curve without changing its shape, is not valid. Moreover, the proposed method is particularly resistant to problems related to electrical shunts. The principle of this method lies in coupling the level of a selective light bias with the level of measured electrical current in order to fix the voltage of a selected sub-cell while sweeping over the current axis. When one of the sub-cells has a fixed voltage, it is then possible to get the I–V characteristics of the second one, shifted by a fixed voltage value. This measurement procedure is simple and requires no modeling. The accuracy of the method is evaluated by numerical simulations of a thin-film silicon p–i–n photodiode. Our technique is then successfully experimentally tested on a specially prepared three-terminal amorphous/microcrystalline silicon tandem solar cell.

Abstract: The MoSe2 layers, as a necessary interface layer in Cu(In,Ga)Se2/Mo for high-efficiency Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells, were observed to form in the Mo and CIGS/Mo films during the selenization process. In order to reveal the determining factor of MoSe2, the correlation of MoSe2 thickness with the Mo sputtering pressure was investigated. The MoSe2 thickness increased with decreasing the sputtering pressure. Furthermore, the dependence of MoSe2 thickness on the deposition time of SiO2 layer and the characterizations of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate that the formation of Na2Sex compounds plays a determining role for the formation of MoSe2 layer. The illuminated I–V characterization showed that the high series resistance of the CIGS solar cell was induced by too thick MoSe2 layer. The significant deterioration of efficiency was observed because of the peeling-off of the absorber layer from Mo layer when the MoSe2 layer was too thin.

Abstract: Substance P as a member of tachykinin family plays an important role in angiogenesis. Hemokinins (HKs) have been identified as new members of substance P-like peptides of tachykinin family. However, the effects of HKs on endothelial cells and angiogenesis have not been studied. For the first time, here we demonstrated that r/mHK-1, hHK-1 and hHK(4-11) dose-dependently stimulated the proliferation, migration, adhesion and tube formation of freshly isolated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and further exhibited in vivo angiogenic effects in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane model. The angiogenic effects of HKs were inhibited by the selective antagonist of neurokinin-1 rather than neurokinin-2 receptor. Mechanistically, HKs activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, stimulated nitric oxide production, and upregulated the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in HUVECs. Taken together, our data suggest that HKs emerge as pivotal endogenous regulators of angiogenesis and represent potential targets for the intervention of angiogenesis in different pathological conditions given their specific peripheral distribution.

Abstract: Microencapsulations of n-octadecane with different crosslinked methylmethacrylate-based polymer as shells were carried out by suspension-like polymerizations. 1,4-butylene glycol diacrylate (BDDA), divinylbenzene (DVB), trimethylolpropanetriacrylate (TMPTA) and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETRA) were employed as crosslinking agents. The influences of the type and amount of crosslinking agent, the type of initiator and polymerization temperature on the properties of as-prepared microencapsulated phase change materials (MicroPCMs) have been studied. The MicroPCMs were characterized using Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thermal properties and thermal stability of MicroPCMs were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermalgravimetric analysis (TGA). Shell mechanical strength was measured by micro/nano-hardness tester. Thermal properties, thermal resistant temperatures as well as shell mechanical strength of MicroPCMs enhanced as the number of crosslinkable functional moieties of the crosslinking agents increased. The MicroPCMs containing 75.3wt% n-octadecane obtained using PETRA as crosslinking agent has the highest latent heats of melting (156.4J/g) and crystallization (182.8J/g) and displays the highest thermal stability and shell mechanical strength. The MicroPCMs prepared with DVB shows a relatively higher shell mechanical strength and heat capacity compared with those prepared with BDDA. Both heat capacity and thermal stability of MicroPCMs prepared by combining 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and redox initiators at 45°C were lower than that of MicroPCMs prepared with AIBN or benzoyl peroxide (BPO) at 85°C. Hence, MicroPCMs with crosslinked methylmethacrylate-based polymer as shells, especially crosslinked polymer shells of higher crosslinking density, show a good potential as a solar-energy storage material.

Abstract: A number of neurological and muscular disorders are characterized by the accumulation of aggregate-prone proteins and are referred to as protein deposit or protein conformation diseases. Besides some sporadic forms, most of them are genetically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although recessive forms also exist. Although genetically very heterogeneous, some of these diseases are the result of mutations in some members of the mammalian small heat shock protein family (sHSP/HSPB), which are key players of the protein quality control system and participate, together with other molecular chaperones and co-chaperones, in the maintenance of protein homeostasis. Thus, on one hand upregulation of specific members of the HSPB family can exert protective effects in protein deposit diseases, such as the polyglutamine diseases. On the other hand, mutations in the HSPBs lead to neurological and muscular disorders, which may be due to a loss-of-function in protein quality control and/or to a gain-of-toxic function, resulting from the aggregation-proneness of the mutants. In this review we summarize the current knowledge about some of the best characterized functions of the HSPBs (e.g. role in cytoskeleton stabilization, chaperone function, anti-aggregation and anti-apoptotic activities), also highlighting differences in the properties of the various HSPBs and how these may counteract protein aggregation diseases. We also describe the mutations in the various HSPBs associated with neurological and muscular disorders and we discuss how gain-of-toxic function mechanisms (e.g. due to the mutated HSPB protein instability and aggregation) and/or loss-of-function mechanisms can contribute to HSPB-associated pathologies.

Abstract: Mitochondria form dynamic tubular networks through processes of fission and fusion. Defect in mitochondrial dynamics lead to various pathologies, including several common and some rare neurodegenerative disorders. OPA1 and MFN2 are two key players in mitochondrial fusion associated with Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy and Charcot Marie Tooth neuropathy type 2A respectively. We used micropatterned coverslips to standardize the visualization of mitochondrial distribution in skin fibroblasts. In fibroblasts from affected patients, mutations in the OPA1 and MFN2 genes were found to affect the volume and cellular distribution of mitochondria. In G1/S cell cycle phase, mitochondria emerging from the microtubule organizing centre may be crucial to mitochondrial biogenesis since it appeared to be protected against mitochondrial fragmentation induced by OPA1 mutations. The standardized quantitative analysis of the mitochondrial network and the description of mitochondrial subcellular distribution should lead to better diagnostic criteria for mitochondrial diseases and yield new insights into mitochondrial dysfunction in disease and aging.

Abstract: To investigate the effect of JAKs–STATs signal pathway on expression of S100A4 in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), the action of S100A4 and hypoxia induced factor 1 (HIF-1) on the proliferation of hypoxic PASMCs. The results showed that S100A4 immunostaining was localized in the cytoplasm and nuclei of PASMCs exposure to hypoxia and it was predominantly expressed in rhomboid cells (R-SMCs). The mRNA and protein levels of S100A4 expression increased in PASMCs after hypoxic stimulus for 4, 8, 16h. The immunofluorescence intensity and protein levels of S100A4 were suppressed, and the number of R-SMCs was reduced, when pretreatment with HIF-1α siRNA, STAT3 siRNA, S100A4 siRNA, and S100A4 inhibitor NSC 95397. Pretreatment with HIF-1α siRNA and anti-IL-6 antibodies, the levels of phospho-JAK2, -STAT3, and S100A4 were decreased, while HIF-1α kept stable in hypoxic cells. Importantly, pretreatment with HIF-1α siRNA, anti-IL-6 antibodies, STAT3 siRNA, and S100A4 siRNA, significantly attenuated the proliferation of PASMCs exposure to hypoxia. These data demonstrate that S100A4 is predominantly expressed in hypoxic R-SMCs, and regulated by the activation of JAK2–STAT3 signal pathway, which is dependent on hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression. These results suggest that JAK2–STAT3 and HIF-1α could serve as targets for the regulation of phenotype modulation of PASMCs during the process of pulmonary vessel lesions.

Abstract: The charm of Cu(In1−xGax)Se2 (CIGS) thin-film solar cells is their potential for flexible, low-weight modules. Steel foil is an attractive candidate for use as a flexible substrate material as it is stable at the high temperatures involved during CIGS processing and is also commercially available. For monolithic series connection of the single cells to a module, an insulating layer is needed on the conducting steel substrate. We tested enamel layers on low-carbon steel as the insulating layer, as source a of sodium doping, and also as a diffusion barrier layer to suppress the diffusion of detrimental elements from the substrate into the CIGS layer, which is more pronounced on mild steel compared to stainless steel. Using enamelled steel, we could achieve a maximum cell efficiency of 17.6% (certified) and a module efficiency of 15.0% on a 10×10cm2 substrate (aperture area=48cm²) with a high temperature multi-stage inline CIGS process. The open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density values of cells and modules prepared in the multi-stage CIGS process used here were often higher on enamelled steel than on the standard soda lime glass substrates.

Abstract: Photovoltaic devices based on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorbers exhibit poor response to short-wavelength (λ) photons, mainly due to the parasitic absorption of the commonly used zinc oxide window and cadmium sulphide (CdS) buffer layers. In this work, it is shown that the energy content of these photons can be better harnessed if the encapsulation layer of modules is doped with luminescent materials. It is shown that the luminescent down-shifting (LDS) of short-λ photons increases the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of CIGS devices by up to 25% absolute in the range 300–380nm and by up to 40% absolute in the region 300–460nm, for devices with 50-nm- and 100-nm-thick CdS layers, respectively. Overall, the short-circuit current density (JSC) of CIGS devices covered with luminescent encapsulation improved by ΔJSC=0.6% for violet-doped EVA and up to ΔJSC=1.8% for a violet–yellow dye mixture. By experimenting with devices of different CdS thicknesses and short-λ EQE profiles, it is suggested that CIGS PV modules equipped with LDS layers must be optimised as a system and all photoactive components of the device be considered in parallel.

Abstract: Al-doped p-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline cubic silicon carbide (nc-3C-SiC:H) thin films were successfully deposited by very high frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (VHF-PECVD) using dimethylaluminum hydride (DMAH) as an Al source. A high dark conductivity of 6.88×10−4S/cm was obtained for a 27nm-thick film under high H2/MMS and plasma power conditions. We applied this optimized film to a heterojunction emitter of n-type c-Si solar cells. The solar cell showed high fill factor of 0.756. The internal quantum efficiency in the short wavelength region was improved to 0.87 with decreasing the thickness of a buffer layer.

Abstract: SiO2 nanorod arrays (NRAs) are fabricated on InGaN-based multiple quantum well (MQW) solar cells using self-assembled Ag nanoparticles as the etching mask and subsequent reactive ion etching. The SiO2 NRAs effectively suppress the undesired surface reflections over the wavelengths from 330 to 570nm, which is attributed to the light-trapping effect and the improved mismatch of refractive index at the air/MQW device interface. Under the air mass 1.5 global illumination, the conversion efficiency of the solar cell is enhanced by ∼21% largely due to increased short-circuit current from 0.71 to 0.76mA/cm2. The enhanced device performances by the optical absorption improvement are supported by the simulation analysis as well.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
MRI-R2* has been accepted as a clinical tool for monitoring iron overload in thalassemia patients, especially for monitoring liver iron concentration (LIC). the most optimal and practical method of analysis however, is still open to further investigations. our objective was to investigate intra- and intersite observer variability of the pixel-wise method for liver R2* analysis in thalassemia patients using a mono-exponential with a constant offset model.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
We performed 88 liver R2* measurements on 72 thalassemia major patients. a single breath-hold multi-echo gradient-echo sequence was acquired and analyzed at both the reference (REF) and local (LoC) sites. the analysis defined the region of interest in the whole liver parenchyma, excluding the great vessels, and were reported as median values.
RESULTS
The R2* values from the REF and LOC were statistically comparable for all comparisons. the intrasite and intersite observer variation were 0.75% (less than 0.9%) and 2.5%, respectively, both of which are comparable to previous reports, but substantially lower than conventional region-based approaches.
CONCLUSION
The low variation of the R2* also yielded excellent variation in the tabulated hepatic iron content. however, caution is required when comparing the results to different implementation methods and appropriate evaluation and validation of methodology for any new scan site is essential before its clinical use.

Abstract: A series of low bandgap copolymers based on cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and thienopyrroledione have been synthesized and characterized. High average molecular weight copolymers could be synthesized by microwave assisted polymerization methods with significantly reduced polymerization times. The copolymers exhibited broad absorption in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum (∼400–700nm), which is a prerequisite for photovoltaic applications. Copolymers P2 and P3 containing thiophene spacers showed a broader absorption with a slightly blue shifted absorption maxima compared to that of P1 due to the loss in the coplanarity of the polymer backbone. All copolymers possess fairly low bandgaps (∼1.7eV) and deep highest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices fabricated from the copolymers and PC71BM gave power conversion efficiencies as high as 3.10% for the P1 devices under illumination of AM1.5G 100mW/cm2.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Many patients with relapsed metastatic breast cancer are pre-treated with taxanes and anthracyclines, which are usually given in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting or as first-line treatment for metastatic disease. The primary objective of this study was to determine the overall response rate for combination treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had relapsed after receiving one adjuvant/neoadjuvant or first-line metastatic chemotherapy regimen containing an anthracycline with/without a taxane. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, time to progression, one-year survival probability, and toxicity.
DESIGN AND SETTING
A single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study conducted at 17 investigative sites in Egypt.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Treatment consisted of gemcitabine (1250mg/m2) on Days 1 and 8 and cisplatin (70mg/m2) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or a maximum of 6 cycles.
RESULTS
Of 144 patients all were evaluable for safety and 132 patients were evaluable for efficacy. The overall response rate was 33.3% and 45.5% of the patients with stable disease as their best response. The median time to progression was 5.1 months and the one-year survival probability was 73%. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were nausea/vomiting (20.1%), neutropenia (19.4%), anemia (13.9%), asthenia (11.1%), diarrhea (9.7%), stomatitis (7.6%), leucopenia (7.6%), and thrombocytopenia (6.2%). Twelve (8.3%) patients had serious adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study indicate that gemcitabine and cisplatin were active and generally well tolerated in pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

Abstract: A timely review series on small heat shock proteins has to appropriately examine their fundamental properties and implications in the cardiovascular system since several members of this chaperone family exhibit robust expression in the myocardium and blood vessels. Due to energetic and metabolic demands, the cardiovascular system maintains a high mitochondrial activity but irreversible oxidative damage might ensue from increased production of reactive oxygen species. How equilibrium between their production and scavenging is achieved becomes paramount for physiological maintenance. For example, heat shock protein B1 (HSPB1) is implicated in maintaining this equilibrium or redox homeostasis by upholding the level of glutathione, a major redox mediator. Studies of gain or loss of function achieved by genetic manipulations have been highly informative for understanding the roles of those proteins. For example, genetic deficiency of several small heat shock proteins such as HSPB5 and HSPB2 is well-tolerated in heart cells whereas a single missense mutation causes human pathology. Such evidence highlights both the profound genetic redundancy observed among the multigene family of small heat shock proteins while underscoring the role proteotoxicity plays in driving disease pathogenesis. We will discuss the available data on small heat shock proteins in the cardiovascular system, redox metabolism and human diseases. From the medical perspective, we envision that such emerging knowledge of the multiple roles small heat shock proteins exert in the cardiovascular system will undoubtedly open new avenues for their identification and possible therapeutic targeting in humans. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Small HSPs in physiology and pathology.

Abstract: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 mediates the export of excess cholesterol from macrophages, contributing to the prevention of atherosclerosis. Advanced glycated albumin (AGE-alb) is prevalent in diabetes mellitus and is associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Independently of changes in ABCA-1 mRNA levels, AGE-alb induces oxidative stress and reduces ABCA-1 protein levels, which leads to macrophage lipid accumulation. These metabolic conditions are known to elicit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We sought to determine if AGE-alb induces ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in macrophages and how disturbances to the ER could affect ABCA-1 content and cholesterol efflux in macrophages. AGE-alb induced a time-dependent increase in ER stress and UPR markers. ABCA-1 content and cellular cholesterol efflux were reduced by 33% and 47%, respectively, in macrophages treated with AGE-alb, and both were restored by treatment with 4-phenyl butyric acid (a chemical chaperone that alleviates ER stress), but not MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor). Tunicamycin, a classical ER stress inductor, also impaired ABCA-1 expression and cholesterol efflux (showing a decrease of 61% and 82%, respectively), confirming the deleterious effect of ER stress in macrophage cholesterol accumulation. Glycoxidation induces macrophage ER stress, which relates to the reduction in ABCA-1 and in reverse cholesterol transport, endorsing the adverse effect of macrophage ER stress in atherosclerosis. Thus, chemical chaperones that alleviate ER stress may represent a useful tool for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis in diabetes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
We evaluated the efficacy and safety of non-cryopreserved storage of autologous hematopoietic stem cells with no post-transplant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support in adult patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for multiple myeloma (MM).
DESIGN AND SETTING
Retrospective review of patients undergoing ASCT from May 2009 to July 2011.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Autologous stem cell were mobilized using G-CSF. Leukapheresis to harvest stem cells was performed on day -2 and -1. The grafts were kept in a conventional blood bank refrigerator at 4°C until reinfusion on day 0. The conditioning regimen consisted of melphalan 200mg/m2 in all patients. The post-chemotherapy myeloablative phase was managed without growth factors.
RESULTS
Between May 2009 to July 2011, 54 adults with MM were treated in our center in Oran. The median age at ASCT was 55 years (range, 35-65). There were 37 males and 17 females. The median harvested CD34+ cell count was 3.60×106/kg (range, 1.90 to 10.52). All patients had neutrophil engraftment on the median of day 10 (range, 6-17) and platelet transfusion independence on the median of day 13 (range 9-24). In the 47 evaluable patients the median post-transplant overall survival had not been reached; the estimated overall survival at 30 months was 93.8% (0.05%), and the estimated disease-free survival at 27 months was 93.6% (0.05%).
CONCLUSION
High-dose chemotherapy and ASCT using non-cryopreserved stem cells and no G-CSF support is safe and feasible in the treatment of MM under our work conditions in developing countries.

Abstract: Correlations of disease phenotypes with glycosylation changes have been analyzed intensively in tumor biology field. In this study we describe glycomic alterations of multidrug resistance in human leukemia cell lines. Using multiple glycan profiling tools: real-time PCR for quantification of glycogenes, FITC–lectin binding for glycan profiling, and mass spectrometry for glycan composition, we compared the glycomics of drug-resistant K562/ADR cells with parental K562 line. The results showed that the expression of glycogenes, glycan profiling and N-glycan composition were different in K562/ADR cells, as compared with those in K562 cells, whereas O-glycans of the two cell lines showed no different mass spectra. Further analysis of the N-glycan regulation by way of tunicamycin application or PNGase F treatment in K562/ADR cells showed partial inhibition of biosynthesis and increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. We targeted glycogene B3GNT8 and ST8SIA4, which were over-expressed in K562/ADR cells, and silenced the expression levels of two glycogenes after using RNA interference approach. The results showed that the silencing of B3GNT8 or ST8SIA4 in K562/ADR cells resulted in increased chemosensitivity to anti-tumor drugs. In conclusion, glycomic alterations are responsible for the overcoming multidrug resistance in human leukemia therapy and the N-linked oligosaccharides are associated with the drug resistance of cancer cells.

Abstract: Shape-stabilized lauric acid/activated carbon composites as phase change materials were prepared by adsorbing liquid lauric acid into activated carbon. In the composites, the lauric acid was used as a phase change material for thermal energy storage, and the activated carbon was used as an adsorbent that acted as the supporting material. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope, X-ray diffractometer, scanning electronic microscope and thermal conductivity apparatus were used to determine the chemical structure, crystalloid phase, microstructure and thermal conductivity, respectively, of the composites. The thermal properties and thermal stability were investigated by a differential scanning calorimeter and a thermogravimetry analyzer. The microstructural analysis results showed that the lauric acid was well adsorbed into the porous network of the activated carbon. The thermal conductivity measurement results presented that the thermal conductivity of the composites was enhanced. The differential scanning calorimetry analysis results indicated that the composites exhibited the same phase change characteristics as those of the lauric acid and their latent heats increased with increase of the lauric acid content in composites. The thermogravimetric analysis results presented that the activated carbon can improve the thermal stability of the composites.

Abstract: Selectively-transparent and conducting photonic crystals (STCPCs) made of alternating layers of sputtered indium-tin oxide (ITO) and spin-coated silica (SiO2) nanoparticle films exhibit Bragg-reflectance peaks in the visible spectrum of 95% reflectivity and have a full width at half maximum that is greater than 200nm. At the same time, their conductive properties are comparable to that of solid sputtered ITO films. Moreover, the average transmission of the STCPCs in the pass-band can be increased to ∼88%, or within 3.3% of the bare glass slide they are fabricated on. Furthermore, we also show that these STCPCs can readily be fabricated on textured surfaces similar to those used for micromorph solar cells. In this context wave optics analysis shows that these STCPCs can be utilized as intermediate reflectors that boost the relative photo-current generated in textured micromorph cells by more than 20% over a broad range of incident angles.

Abstract: A sequential two-step near-infrared (NIR) quantum splitting (QS) has been demonstrated in a Ho3+-doped YVO4 phosphor, whereby one incident ultraviolet (UV)-to-visible photon, enabling Ho3+:5F4,5S2 excited, could be split efficiently into two NIR photons with emissions at 1015 and 1190nm, respectively. The involved NIR-QS mechanism has been analyzed in terms of the static–dynamic photoemission, monitored excitation spectra and time-resolved emission spectra. Internal quantum yield is obtained up to 112% on the basis of experimental and theoretical calculation results. It is found that the broadband [VO4]3− group as a sensitizer could efficiently transfer its energy to Ho3+ activator ions, thus dramatically enhancing the UV photo-response and the NIR luminescence intensity of the phosphor. Further development of this two-step two-photon NIR-QS phosphor may open up a new approach for enhancing the photo-response of photovoltaic cells, particular in the wavelength range of 250–560nm.

Abstract: Bone loss is caused by the dysregulated activity of osteoclasts which degrade the extracellular bone matrix. The tyrosine kinase Pyk2 is highly expressed in osteoclasts, and mice lacking Pyk2 exhibit an increase in bone mass, in part due to impairment of osteoclast function. Pyk2 is activated by phosphorylation at Y402 following integrin activation, but the mechanisms leading to Pyk2 dephosphorylation are poorly understood. In the current study, we examined the mechanism of action of the dynamin GTPase on Pyk2 dephosphorylation. Our studies reveal a novel mechanism for the interaction of Pyk2 with dynamin, which involves the binding of Pyk2's FERM domain with dynamin's plextrin homology domain. In addition, we demonstrate that the dephosphorylation of Pyk2 requires dynamin's GTPase activity and is mediated by the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST. The dephosphorylation of Pyk2 by dynamin and PTP-PEST may be critical for terminating outside-in integrin signaling, and for stabilizing cytoskeletal reorganization during osteoclast bone resorption.

Abstract: Surface plasmon resonance was observed to red shift in hexagonal nanohemisphere Ag array covered by double-walled carbon nanotubes. By altering the density of carbon nanotubes, the surface plasmon resonance can be tuned from 563nm to 586nm and the light scattering is enhanced in the spectral range from orange to red. This leads to improved performance of amorphous silicon solar cells deposited on top, which yields a short-circuit current density of 14.07mA/cm2 and a power conversion efficiency of 6.55% under the illumination of AM 1.5G. This carbon nanotubes' density-dependent surface plasmon shift is attributed to the dielectric constant change around the periodic Ag nanostructure, which can be applied to other solar cell materials by fine-tuning the surface plasmon resonance to enhance the absorption at wavelength where the active layer is less absorptive.

Abstract: We here report on our investigation of the properties of polysiloxane rubber waveguides doped with Lumogen Red 305 for the production of luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) devices. Samples with different dye concentrations were produced and their optical properties were characterized by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. Moreover, different concentrations of Au nanoparticles were dispersed in the matrix in order to study the possibility of enhancing the fluorophore fluorescence yield. The light output from the edges of the samples, irradiated with a solar simulator was measured with an integrating sphere and the light yield was compared to that obtained with polycarbonate waveguides containing the same amount of the fluorescent dye BASF Lumogen Red305. Preliminary results from measurements with a GaAs photovoltaic cell and a silicon photodiode coupled to the polysiloxane waveguides are also presented.

Abstract: Films of poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were controllably exposed to CS2 vapor in a column with a linear solvent vapor pressure gradient. Changes in the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM thin film were monitored and correlated to the ability of this thin film to act as the active layer in an organic solar cell. The results show that the crystallinity and crystal size of the P3HT increase initially with solvent vapor pressure and annealing time, but longer exposure to solvent decreases P3HT crystallinity and photovoltaic efficiency. Neutron reflectivity indicates that the PCBM segregates to the Si substrate in the as-cast thin film, but distributes throughout the film with solvent annealing. The changes in crystallinity and the depth profile of the P3HT:PCBM mixture differ from those induced by thermal annealing. The structural variation with solvent exposure is correlated to photovoltaic function, demonstrating that the solvent annealing provides a window of optimum efficiency, which depends on solvent exposure. Moreover, the control of depth profile and structure should be generally applicable to a broad range of polymer-nanoparticle mixtures and thus these results provide fundamental information that can be used to control the depth profile, morphology and function of thin film nanocomposites.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) with a conductivity enhanced by doping with either dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or ethylene glycol (EG) were successfully fabricated to increase the photon harvesting property through localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) by adding Au nanoparticles to PH500, a hole collection layer, and effectively separating the generated charges. At Au nanoparticle and DMSO doping concentrations of 20wt% and 1wt%, respectively, the characteristics of the OPVs were optimized with a short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and estimated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.0mA/cm2, 0.595V, 57.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Compared to the device with a buffer layer of conventional PEDOT:PSS, PCE was improved by ca. 85%. The series resistance (Rs), shunt resistance (Rsh), and hole mobility were 18Ωcm2, 673Ωcm2 and 4.2cm2/Vs, respectively.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Due to the limited incidence of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) in pediatric liver graft recipients, there is a scarcity of data on the characteristics of the disease in this population. We aimed to analyze the special features and behavior of PTLD arising after pediatric liver transplantation.
DESIGN
A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted for the available data on PTLD in pediatric liver recipients pediatric PTLD through a search of Pubmed and Google scholar using appropriate terms.
METHODS
We sought data on liver recipients younger than 18 years of age at the time of transplantation. from 51 reports, 43 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. overall 250 cases of PTLD (212 pediatric PTLD) were found from 43 reports. Data on pediatric patients was compared to adults.
RESULTS
Pediatric PTLD lesions were more likely of the polymorphic type (P=.004) and polyclonal (when age cut-off was defined at 12 years; P=.023). remission rates, metastasis frequency and organ involvements were not different between the groups (P>.1 for all). survival analysis showed no disparity between pediatric PTLD and adult patients (P>.1); but when data was reanalyzed for patients surviving at least 4 months post diagnosis, the log rank test showed that pediatric patients have a superior outcome compared to adults (P=.045).
CONCLUSIONS
Pediatric liver recipients developing PTLD have relatively better disease presentation and behavior than that in adults. stomach involvement was also more frequently seen in patients younger than 12 years, and should be more intensively evaluated. future studies with a prospective approach and larger population size are needed for confirming our results.

Abstract: Homogeneous dye adsorption and deep penetration into a titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin film of the negative electrode in a dye-sensitized solar cell were the main factors to obtain high performance. A dye is typically adsorbed by soaking the TiO2 film in a dye solution. A long immersion time is needed to adsorb the dye and it is also difficult to adsorb the dye to the depth of the TiO2 thin film in a short time. In this study, electrophoresis was used to solve these problems. A dye solution of water or ethanol in which Eosin Y dissolves behaves like a colloid. The adsorption time needed to adsorb a specified amount of dye was shortened by the electrophoresis compared to immersion. An optimum concentration, current density and electrophoresis time exist for better conversion efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) when the dye molecules are absorbed by electrophoresis. Thus, electrophoresis is effective to adsorb Eosin Y on the TiO2 thin film.

Abstract: A non-vacuum, solution-based method to deposit thin layers of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) as absorber layer for kesterite-based thin film solar cells was investigated. The concept is based on multiple spin-coated layers of ether solutions containing Cu, Zn, and Sn salts as precursors and monoethanolamine (MEA) as stabilizer, which are subsequently converted into CZTSe layers by annealing in selenium atmosphere. The influence of initial metal ratios and the number of spin-coated layers on the composition and homogeneity of the CZTSe layers was studied. Both zinc and, to a smaller extent, tin contents tend to decrease in selenized CZTSe layers, because of the partial evaporation of their volatile compounds during the selenization process. Using optimized metal ratios in the precursor solution, single phase kesterite layers of 1–2μm thickness were obtained. Increasing the number of spin-coating cycles caused the formation of “bubbles” between the CZTSe and the Mo layer, as a result of the compressive stress originating from the volume expansion during the selenization step. SEM micrographs and EDX compositional measurements of cross-sections also revealed a thin carbon-rich layer at the Mo back contact/CZTSe interface, which nevertheless provided a sufficient electrical contact between the metal contact and the absorber. The optical energy gap of the kesterite absorber determined from a quantum efficiency measurement is about 0.9eV. Solar cells with efficiencies of up to 2.76%, with Voc of 381mV, Jsc of 15.8mA/cm2 and fill factor of 42.1% were achieved for copper poor and zinc rich CZTSe absorbers.

Abstract: Transparent and conductive ZnO:Al films were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering on opaque (Si/SiO2) or transparent (glass) substrates. The internal stress evolution has been measured in situ using a high resolution 2D curvature measurement technique. Internal tensile or compressive stresses were generated, depending on the sputtering pressure, oxygen addition level and substrate temperature. The origin of the observed stress level is correlated with factors affecting the film growth mechanism, and the relation with the electro-optical properties of the resulting transparent and conductive oxide films is highlighted.

Abstract: Malignant gliomas exhibit abnormal expression of proteolytic enzymes that may participate in the uncontrolled cell proliferation and aberrant interactions with the brain extracellular matrix. The multifunctional membrane bound serine aminopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV has been linked to the development and progression of several malignancies, possibly both through the enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms. In this report we demonstrate the expression of DPP-IV and homologous proteases fibroblast activation protein, DPP8 and DPP9 in primary cell cultures derived from high-grade gliomas, and show that the DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity is negatively associated with their in vitro growth. More importantly, the DPP-IV positive subpopulation isolated from the primary cell cultures using immunomagnetic separation exhibited slower proliferation. Forced expression of the wild as well as the enzymatically inactive mutant DPP-IV in glioma cell lines resulted in their reduced growth, migration and adhesion in vitro, as well as suppressed glioma growth in an orthotopic xenotransplantation mouse model. Microarray analysis of glioma cells with forced DPP-IV expression revealed differential expression of several candidate genes not linked to the tumor suppressive effects of DPP-IV in previous studies. Gene set enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed overrepresentation of gene ontology terms associated with cell proliferation, cell adhesion and migration. In conclusion, our data show that DPP-IV may interfere with several aspects of the malignant phenotype of glioma cells in great part independent of its enzymatic activity.

Abstract: Excess current/capacitance behavior was observed on the Ag:Ca/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/ITO structure and the associated mechanism(s) were identified by performing both dc current–voltage (I–V) and ac capacitance–conductance–voltage (C/G–V) measurements in dark and light exposure, respectively. The excess current/capacitance issue, originated owing to a minority carrier injection, has manifested itself as conductivity modulation in I–V and decrease in capacitance in C–V at a sufficiently large forward bias. Satisfactory analysis in I–V as transport property and C(G)–V as storage feature were carried out on Ag:Ca/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/ITO structure.

Abstract: In this article, a novel rear structure using Ag nanoparticles to create surface plasmons to enhance light trapping is applied on the rear of planar high efficiency PERT (Passivated Emitter and Rear Totally Diffused) silicon wafer cells, targeting the spectrum range from 1000nm to 1200nm. Variations of this rear structure that combine Ag nanoparticles, dielectric layers and back metal reflectors were studied and analysed. Thickness of the rear surface passivation SiO2 spacer layer was optimised to achieve maximum optical enhancement using surface plasmons but with minimum electronic losses due to recombination effects. The effect of the precursor evaporated Ag film thickness was also studied as a means to vary the size/shape of the nanoparticles. The measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the best performing rear reflector shows a maximum enhancement of more than 4-fold at 1160nm. This corresponds to a 16% photocurrent increase (calculated from 900nm to 1200nm) compared to the cell with conventional Al rear reflector. Moreover, from the measured spectral response and optical absorption data, we successfully separated and analysed the electrical and optical properties of the novel rear light trapping designs. Light trapping features were quantified using optical parameters characterised by an effective optical path length factor Z, while electrical parameters such as surface recombination velocity S (cm/s) and effective minority charge carrier lifetime τbulk (μs) were also extracted. Relative errors for these parameters were also calculated. For the cell with the best performing rear structure, we report a maximum Z factor enhancement of around 6-fold using Ag nanoparticles in conjunction with a detached Ag reflector, in comparison to the reference at 1200nm.

Abstract: Photocatalysis phenomena in TiO2 have been under intense investigation for its potential applications in pollution abatement and in production of hydrogen for green energy. Present study shows that surface modification is a potential technique to achieve efficient and stable plasmonic assisted sun light driven photocatalyst with TiO2 thin films. A few layers (of different thicknesses) of metallic silver have been deposited (by DC magnetron sputtering technique and subsequently annealed) on the surface of sol-gel processed and spin coated TiO2 thin films. The photocatalytic activity (PCA) has been measured with 254nm, 352nm and actual sun light excitations; aqueous Rhodamine B (RhB) dye is used to estimate the photocatalytic oxidation. The photocatalytic activity has been expressed as the number of RhB molecules oxidized for a given photon flux at the excitation wavelength; also rate constants have been evaluated. It is observed that (i) silver exists in the metallic state on the surface of TiO2 thin films, (ii) the surface work function of TiO2 thin films is modified by the silver as revealed by Kelvin probe measurements and (iii) the PCA of silver modified TiO2 thin films is higher in comparison with unmodified surface. An attempt has been made to explain the higher activity of the surface modified Ag/TiO2 thin film photocatalyst through the plasmon assisted photocatalytic process. The present study clearly establishes the view that surface modification of TiO2 is a viable approach towards achieving an efficient sun light photocatalyst.

Abstract: Human mesenchymal stem cells hold promise as gene therapy vectors for delivery of various genes to solid tumors for either therapeutic or tumor-tracing purposes. However, whether Mesenchymal stem cells support or inhibit tumor growth remains unknown. Herein, we first observed that mesenchymal stem cells primed with IFN-γ selectively induced the death of tumor cell lines, but not normal cells. We further identified that IFN-γ-primed mesenchymal stem cells expressed tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Tumor-suppressive effect of IFN-γ-primed mesenchymal stem cells could be blocked by activity neutralization or expression reduction of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Moreover, mesenchymal stem cells mediated apoptosis of tumor cells by activating caspase-3 in such cells, via a mechanism involving tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. However, when IFN-γ-primed or non-primed mesenchymal stem cells were co-injected into nude mice along with H460 cells, tumor growth was much faster than that of the group receiving only tumor cells (p<0.01) because of the promoting vascularization effect of mesenchymal stem cells, although IFN-γ-primed mesenchymal stem cells also exerted a certain degree of tumor-suppressive effect compared with non-primed cells (2.79±0.9g versus 2.03±0.6g). Collectively, our findings show that IFN-γ-primed human mesenchymal stem cells could induce cancer cell apoptosis via TRAIL-mediated pathway. In addition, our data afford a novel explanation of the opposing effects of hMSCs presence on tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Thus, more attention needs to be paid when seeking to exploit mesenchymal stem cells as a therapeutic option under the condition of malignant tumor.

Abstract: Abstract
One of the main causes of the degradation of organic solar cells is the interface between the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode and the poly (3,4-ethylendioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer (HTL), which is known to be unstable. On the contact surface, corrosion of the ITO is induced by PEDOT:PSS, and this degrades the performance of the device. In this paper, we solve this problem by introducing an inorganic HTL, nickel oxide (NiO), between the ITO and the active layer. Solution process, a low-cost production method for preparing thin films, is employed to fabricate the NiO HTL for organic solar cells based on poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The performance of the resulting organic solar cells is optimized by modifying the baking conditions of the NiO thin films, yielding a power conversion efficiency enhancement of 1.97% and fill factor of 52.11%. Moreover, a remarkable improvement in cell lifetime is observed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies show that cell performance and stability strongly depend on the oxygen composition ratio of the NiO structure. The transition of the O2− ratio is a key factor that determines the conductivity of NiO. These results compare favorably with those reported in the literature for conventional devices with PEDOT:PSS.

Abstract: High efficiency and high open-circuit voltage (VOC) ITO/boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc)/C60/bathocuproine/Al organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated in this study. Molecular packing was adjusted by controlling the deposition rate of SubPc, thus influencing the energy level of SubPc, which not only increased the energy level difference from the LUMO level of C60 to the HOMO level of SubPc, but also reduced the energy barrier between the ITO/SubPc interface and diminished the accumulation and recombination of holes in SubPc, resulting in considerable improvement in both the VOC (1.02V) and fill factor (65.37%) of the device, and a 3.96% final efficiency of the device.

Abstract: We report the characteristics of a Ti–In–Sn–O (Ti–ITO) multicomponent electrode prepared by co-sputtering of ITO and anatase TiO2 targets for reducing high-cost indium content in the anode layer of organic solar cells (OSCs). The dependence of electrical, optical, structural, and surface properties of the Ti–ITO multicomponent electrodes on the RF power was investigated in detail. The optimized Ti–ITO (80W TiO2 co-sputtered ITO) electrode exhibited a low sheet resistance of 18.06Ω/square, a high average optical transmittance of 80.61% and a root mean square roughness of 2.40nm. The anatase TiO2 phase in the ITO matrix prevents the bixbyite structure from attaining the preferred orientation, producing a smooth surface of the Ti–ITO electrode. Moreover, the OSC with the optimized Ti–ITO anode showed an open circuit voltage (0.60V), short circuit current (8.33mA/cm2), fill factor (63.99%) and power conversion efficiency (3.18%) comparable to those of OSCs with a reference ITO electrode. This indicates that the Ti–ITO multicomponent electrode is a promising indium-saving multicomponent electrode that to reduces the indium content in ITO electrodes for low-cost OSCs.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common salivary gland tumor with varying behavior among different histopathological grades. The objective of this study was to determine the expression of Bcl-2 protein in mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) and to correlate with histological grades.
METHODS
The records of 40 cases of MEC were collected from the histopathology department. Fresh slides were prepared and fresh diagnoses were made using the grading criteria for MEC. immunohistochemical markers for Bcl-2 were applied and the results analyzed using the chi-square test.
RESULTS
Of 40 cases, 20 were males and 20 were females. The range in age of the patients was 6 to 67 years mean (sD) was 42.6 (1.85) years. Twenty-two were low grade (55%), 11 high grade (27.5%) and 7 (17.5%) were intermediate grade MEC. Among these 40 cases, Bcl-2 expression was positive in 24 cases and negative in 16 cases. in 22 cases of low-grade MEC, 19 were positive while only 3 were negative. in high-grade tumors, all 11 cases were found to have a negative expression of Bcl-2 protein. in intermediate-grade MEC, 5 cases showed positive expression while only 2 cases showed negative expression.
CONCLUSION
Bcl-2 protein expression showed positive expression in low-grade and negative expression in high-grade MEC. intermediate grade showed more than 50% positive results for Bcl-2. Correlation between grades of MEC and expression of Bcl-2 is statistically significant and can be used for the depicting the prognosis of MEC along with other prognostic and clinico-pathological parameters.

Abstract: Crystalline silicon carbide alloys have a very high potential to be used as transparent conductive window layers in thin-film solar cells provided they can be prepared in thin-film form and at compatible deposition temperatures. Using Hot-Wire Chemical Vapor Deposition (HWCVD) technique, silicon carbide in microcrystalline form (μc-SiC:H) has been prepared at low substrate temperature. Monomethylsilane and hydrogen are used as the precursor gases. The material is highly conductive, unintentionally n-type in nature, and possess wide optical gap. These properties have been utilized by employing the μc-SiC:H layer as the window layer in n-side illuminated single junction microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) solar cells. Some typical issues related to this device research and development are described here. In particular the nucleation of the intrinsic μc-Si:H absorber layer on the n-type μc-SiC:H layer needs attention. With proper device design high short-circuit current densities of 29.6mA/cm2 and quantum efficiencies up to 90% are obtained resulting in a maximum conversion efficiency of 9.6% within a 2-μm-thick μc-Si:H solar cell.

Abstract: We investigate the performance of amorphous Si (a-Si) solar cells fabricated with Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) deposition technique. The ICP system produces a-Si films with low defect density (3×1015cm−3), resulting in a conversion efficiency of 9.6%. Deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) reveals that hole carriers trapped at defects near the valence band edge delocalize at 130K; while trapped electrons can only be emitted into the conduction band near room temperature. Spectrally resolved DLTS study further indicates that light soaking enhances the emission rate of the tapped electrons near the conduction band edge while reduces the transition moments from the hole-trapping defect levels to the conduction band. The combined effects and light soaking-induced defects are responsible for the degradation of a thin film solar cell by light soaking.

Abstract: Emergence of resistance to imatinib mesylate complicates the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors are capable to overcome resistance mediated by most mutations except T315I. As this mutation is causative for 20% of clinically observed resistances, the need for novel treatment strategies becomes obvious and urgent. The autophosphorylated BCR/ABL Tyr177 recruits Grb2 via its SH2 domain, which is required for efficient induction of the myeloproliferative disease by BCR/ABL. The death effector domain (DED) is the critical factor for activation of caspase-8 induced apoptosis signal. We thus speculated that transduction of an exogenous SH2-DED (SD) fragment into the CML cells may inhibit the binding of BCR/ABL Tyr177 and Grb2, activate caspase-8 induced apoptosis and serve as a novel CML treatment strategy. The infection of the recombinant adenovirus Ad5/F35-SD was verified to show both cell proliferation-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effect. Further exploration into the underlying mechanisms revealed that Ad5/F35-SD exerted its function by binding to the phospho-BCR/ABL Tyr177 site, reducing Ras, MAPK and AKT kinase activities, and activating caspase-8 induced apoptosis signal by DED protein binding to DED domain of precursor caspase-8. Moreover, high anti-proliferative activity of Ad5/F35-SD was observed in nude mice and its leukemia-protective effect was evident in chronic myeloid leukemia model mice injected with BCR/ABL+ BaF3 cells. In conclusion, Ad5/F35-SD exhibits anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity on BCR/ABL positive leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo through disruption of Grb2 SH2-phospho-BCR/ABL Tyr177 complex formation and induction of caspase-8 activation.

Abstract: Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been under intensive studies, due to their attractive properties such as large scale, low cost, lightweight. However, their short lifetime, compared with the inorganic counterparts, has placed a severe restriction on the potential applications. To reveal the cause of the short life, here we report the finding of two distinguishable degradation mechanisms, from a typical organic/polymeric solar cell, based on polymer blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, fabricated on indium tin oxide-coated glass substrate. The first mode is associated with a localized failed area due to moisture encroachment, where the confronted areas are either completely dead or still 100% functioning. The second mode was found to be related to a mild decrease in power conversion efficiency (PCE) and was induced by a possible interfacial passivation occurred at the organic/cathode interface, due to the presence of residual oxygen, moisture and other impurities. The simulation results agree well with our experimental findings in showing that the degradation due to the localized moisture encroachment may be delayed by encapsulating the OSCs with desiccant. The degradation due to the interfacial passivation could be eliminated by the removal of low work function cathode at the sacrifice of PCE.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) with their band gap energies around 1.45eV and 1.0eV, respectively, can be used as the absorber layer in thin film solar cells. By using a mixture of both compounds, Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe), a band gap tuning may be possible. The latter material has already shown promising results such as solar cell efficiencies up to 10.1%. In this work, CZTSSe thin films were grown in order to study its structure and to establish the best growth precursors. SEM micrographs reveal an open columnar structure for most samples and EDS composition profiling of the cross sections show different selenium gradients. X-ray diffractograms show different shifts of the kesterite/stannite (112) peak, which indicate the presence of CZTSSe. From Raman scattering analysis, it was concluded that all samples had traces of CZTS and CZTSSe. The composition of the CZTSSe layer was estimated using X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering and both results were compared. It was concluded that Se diffused more easily in precursors with ternary Cu–Sn–S phases and metallic Zn than in precursors with ZnS and/or CZTS already formed. It was also showed that a combination of X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering can be used to estimate the ratio of S per Se in CZTSSe samples.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer mortality. Metastasis is the major concern that causes death in HCC. The goal of this study was to identify tumor-derived proteins in serum during HCC metastasis using an orthotopic xenograft tumor model and explore the role of key protein in HCC metastasis. Serum samples collected from HCCLM3-R metastatic HCC tumor model at specific stages of metastasis (1 wk, 3 wks and 6 wks) were subjected to iTRAQ labeling followed by 2DLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Twenty tumor-derived proteins were identified through human specific peptides. Secretory clusterin (sCLU), which was significantly upregulated during cancer progression and metastasis, was chosen for further study. The expression of sCLU was significantly higher in metastatic HCC cell lines and samples from metastatic HCC patients. ShRNA-mediated down-regulation of sCLU resulted in a reduced migratory capacity in HCC cell lines, as well as a reduction in pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Overexpression of sCLU in HepG2 cell line showed increased cell migratory ability. Further study found that sCLU contributed to HCC migration and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro, and metastasis in vivo. In addition, sCLU also plays an important role in the regulation of TGF-β1-smad3 signaling. These findings suggest that sCLU may promote HCC metastasis via the induction of EMT process and may be a candidate target for HCC therapy.

Abstract: Indolinone-substituted methanofullerene, 1-(3,5-di-tret-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)-3-(3-cyclopropane[1,9](C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene-3-yl)-indolin-2-one (HBIM), has been studied as an electron acceptor for polymer–fullerene solar cells. HBIM is easier to synthesize and purify than the standard fullerene derivative for polymer solar cells, PCBM. Optical absorption, solubility, and electrochemical properties of HBIM are reported. Solar cells with the device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:HBIM/CaAl have been investigated with the reference cells based on the P3HT:PCBM blend. We study the effect of thermal annealing on the device performance and the surface morphology of the active layer. The power conversion efficiency of P3HT:HBIM devices with a weight ratio of 1:1 is about 2% under illumination by AM1.5G (100mW/cm2) radiation. The P3HT:HBIM devices show the same open-circuit voltage as the P3HT:PCBM ones, but the short-circuit current and the fill factor are considerably less.

Abstract: In order to reduce electricity generation costs of concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies, new low-cost reflector materials are being developed. These materials need to withstand harsh outdoor conditions without a significant loss in specular reflectance. In this work, samples of enhanced anodized aluminum reflectors protected by a sol–gel coating that have been exposed at different weathering sites were analyzed with an innovative specular reflectometer in order to monitor corrosion and scattering caused by surface roughness. A model to estimate the specular reflectance as a function of exposure conditions at different weathering sites has been developed.

Abstract: A two-step electrochemical route for fabrication of Cu–Zn–Sn (CZT) and Se precursors' layers for a thin film Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) absorber for solar cells is demonstrated. The CZT was electrochemically co-deposited in a citrate solution and after that an appropriate amount of Se was electrodeposited on the top. The CZT+Se were annealed in Ar atmosphere using a slow or fast increase in temperature up to 500°C. SEM with EDX, XRD and Raman spectroscopy examinations of precursors and of the manufactured CZTSe thin films were carried out. The XRD measurements indicated that the CZT precursor contained η-Cu6.26Sn5, Sn and γ-CuZn5 phases. The electrodeposited Se was polycrystalline with a hexagonal structure. The manufactured CZTSe in all the cases presented Cu2ZnSnSe4 with kesterite or partially disordered kesterite structure; however a purer CZTSe phase was formed using the fast increase in the annealing temperature.

Abstract: Molybdenum back contact in CuIn1−xGaxSe2−ySy (CIGSeS) solar cells is usually deposited using DC magnetron sputtering. Properties of thin films are dependent on process parameters. Films deposited at high power and low pressure, tend to be more conductive. However, such films exhibit poor adhesional strength since the films are under compressive stress. Films deposited at low power and high pressure tend to be under tensile stress and exhibit higher roughness and resistivity, while the films adhere very well to the sodalime glass substrate. Therefore, it has been a practice to deposit multi-layered Mo back contact to achieve properties of good adhesion and higher conductivity. Deposition of multi-layered back contact results in either increase in deposition time if a single target is used or increase in foot print if multiple targets are used resulting in an increase in the total cost of production. Experiments were carried out to understand the effects of working pressure, sputtering power and working distance on molybdenum film properties with the final aim to develop a process recipe for deposition of a single molybdenum film with acceptable properties of both good adhesion and higher conductivity. Experiments were carried out by varying the working pressure and keeping the sputtering power constant and then varying the sputtering power keeping the working pressure constant. Adhesive tape test was performed on each film to determine the adhesional strength of the films. Moreover, the sheet resistance and the average roughness for each film were measured using a four probe measurement setup and the Dektak Profilometer, respectively. All experiments were also carried out on narrow and long glass strips in order to estimate the residual stress in the film using the bend test method.

Abstract: Tubulointerstitial injury is a common pathway in progressive renal impairment and human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) play a crucial role in this process. Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) has received increasing attention due to its potential utility as the therapeutic target and biomarker for kidney injury. This study aims to explore the underlying mechanism regulating the release of KIM-1. Cultured primary human PTEC expressed and released KIM-1 from the apical surface through an ectodomain shedding process mediated by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), independent of gene expression and protein synthesis. The constitutive KIM-1 shedding by PTEC was enhanced in a dose- and time-dependent manner by human serum albumin (HSA) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), two important physiological stimuli found during kidney injury. Data from PCR array screening of MMPs gene expression in PTEC following activation by HSA or TNF-α, and from blocking experiments using either synthetic MMP inhibitors or MMP gene knockdown by siRNA, revealed that the constitutive and accelerated shedding of KIM-1 in cultured PTEC was mediated by MMP-3. Furthermore, the up-regulation of MMP-3 and KIM-1 release by PTEC was associated with generation of reactive oxygen species. In a mouse model of acute kidney injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion, increased expression of MMP-3 and KIM-1 as well as their co-localization were observed in kidney from ischemic but not in sham-operated mice. Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo evidences suggest that MMP-3 plays an inductive role in KIM-1 shedding by PTEC.

Abstract: Thin films of NixW1−x oxide were prepared by reactive DC magnetron co-sputtering and were investigated by optical and electrochemical measurements. Electrochromism was found only for 0<x<0.3 but not for 0.3<x<0.6, though films with x∼0.4 could still sustain reversible charge insertion. The coloration efficiency was largest for 0.10<x<0.15. The charge capacity of the NixW1−x oxide films decreased upon increasing the value of x as a consequence of a decreasing ion diffusion coefficient leading to slower kinetics.

Abstract: Cyclo(His-Pro) is an endogenous cyclic dipeptide that exerts oxidative damage protection by selectively activating the transcription factor Nrf2 signalling pathway. Given the existence of a tight interplay of the Nrf2/NF-κB systems and that the pro-inflammatory response is governed by transcription factor NF-κB, here we sought to investigate whether and how cyclo(His-Pro) interferes with the cross-talk between the antioxidant Nrf2/heme oxygenase-1 and the pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathways. By knocking down the Nrf2 gene, we confirmed that cyclo(His-Pro) inhibits NF-κB nuclear accumulation induced by paraquat in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells via the Nrf2/heme oxygenase-1 pathway. The protection required functional heme oxygenase-1 activity, since zinc protoporphyrin IX, a heme oxygenase-1 inhibitor, prevented NF-κB inhibition, and the presence of exogenous carbon monoxide and bilirubin afforded cytoprotection against paraquat-induced toxicity by preventing NF-κB activation. Cyclooxygenase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase 3, two gene products governed by NF-κB, were down-regulated by cyclo(His-Pro) and up-regulated in heme oxygenase-1 knock-down cells. We validated the general mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effects by treating PC12 and murine microglial BV2 cells with different pro-inflammatory agents. Finally, cyclo(His-Pro) reduced 12-otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced oedema in mouse ear inflammation model. Results, by showing that cyclo(His-pro) suppresses the pro-inflammatory NF-κB signalling via the Nrf2-mediated heme oxygenase-1 activation, contribute to the understanding of essential cellular pathways and allow the proposal of cyclo(His-Pro) as an in vivo anti-inflammatory compound.

Abstract: High mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) had been proved to induce maturation and activation of dendritic cell (DC), however, the endogenous changes and mechanisms underlying are unknown. Since endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) activates an adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) that facilitates cellular survival and repair, we hypothesized that HMGB1 may regulate the function of DC by modulating ERS. In our study, HMGB1 stimulation induced significant ERS responses in DCs in a time- and dose-dependent manner, demonstrated by the up-regulation of a number of ERS markers. Gene silence of XBP-1 in splenic DCs decreased the levels of CD80, CD86 as well as major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II expression and cytokine secretion after HMGB1 treatment, when compared with untransfected or nontargeting-transfected DCs (all P<0.05). Moreover, XBP-1 silenced DCs after treatment with HMGB1 failed to stimulate notable proliferation and differentiation of T cells, unlike normal DCs or nontargeting-transfected DCs (all P<0.05). Gene silence of XBP-1 resulted in down-regulation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) expression on the surface of splenic DCs induced by HMGB1 stimulation (P<0.05). These findings demonstrate an important role for ERS and its regulator XBP-1 in HMGB1-induced maturation and activation of DCs.

Abstract: Changes in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i are believed to influence the proliferation and differentiation of airway epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, using mouse alveolar epithelial E10 cells, we demonstrated that the treatment of lung epithelial cells with BLM resulted in elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels. BLM further increased P2rx7 mRNA expression and P2X7R protein levels, paralleled by increased PKC-β1 levels. BLM treatment or stimulation of the P2X7R with the P2X7R agonist BzATP induced translocation of PKC-β1 from the cytoplasm to the membrane. The expression of PKC-β1 was repressed by the P2X7R inhibitor oxATP, suggesting that PKC-β1 is downstream of P2X7R activation. Furthermore, cells exposed to BLM contained increased amounts of P2X7R and PKC-β1 in Cav-1 containing lipid raft fractions. The comparison of lung tissues from wild-type and P2rx7−/− mice revealed decreased protein and mRNA levels of PKC-β1 and CaM as well as decreased immunoreactivity for PKC-β1. The knockdown of P2X7R in alveolar epithelial cells resulted also in a loss of PKC-β1. These data suggest that the effect of P2X7R on expression of PKC-β1 detected in alveolar epithelial cells is also functioning in the animal model. Immunohistochemical evaluation of fibrotic lungs derived from a BLM-induced mouse model revealed a strong increase in PKC-β1 immunoreactivity. The present experiments demonstrated that the increased expression of P2X7R influences PKC-β1. We predict that increased Ca2+ concentration stimulates PKC-β1, whereas the prerequisite for activating PKC-β1 after P2X7R increase remained to be determined. Our findings suggest that PKC-β1 is important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Toll-like receptors are well known as molecular sensors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. They control activation of the innate immune response and subsequently shape the adaptive immune response. Recent publications have demonstrated that Toll-like receptors also play important roles in multiple human cancers, yet their function in oral squamous cell carcinoma remains unclear. In this study, we showed that both oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and tissues from oral squamous carcinoma patients express relatively high levels of Toll-like receptor 3. We also found that synthetic dsRNA-polyinosinic-polycytidilic acid, a Toll-like receptor 3 ligand, induced apoptosis of oral squamous carcinoma cells mainly via Toll-like receptor 3, through interferon-β production and activation of caspases 3 and 9. Moreover, in an oral squamous cell carcinoma xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated for the first time that activation of Toll-like receptor 3 inhibited oral squamous cell carcinoma tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, the direct proapoptotic activity of Toll-like receptor 3 in human oral squamous carcinoma cells may make this protein a viable therapeutic target in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma.

Pivotal role of activating transcription factor 6α in myocardial adaptation to chronic hypoxia,

Abstract: Hypoxic states are generally associated with cardiovascular disease. Adaptation to chronic hypoxia is one well-defined means of improving cardiac tolerance to certain kinds of stresses. However, the details of the mechanisms underlying myocardial adaptation to chronic hypoxia are still poorly understood. Hypoxia stresses the endoplasmic reticulum and activates unfolded protein response. However, the behavior of individual signaling pathways can vary markedly over time. By examining myocardial samples from patients with cyanotic congenital cardiac defects, we detected endoplasmic reticulum stress and found that, out of all the components of the unfolded protein response, only activating transcription factor 6α limb was activated in cyanotic patients. The activation of activating transcription factor 6α and expression of glucose regulated protein 78 were notably induced in cardiac myocytes cultured for prolonged hypoxia (1% O2 for 48h). When the activation of activating transcription factor 6α under prolonged hypoxia was blocked by chemical inhibitor Brefeldin A, the rate of apoptosis among cardiac myocytes increased and levels of cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase also increased significantly. After the expression of activating transcription factor 6α was knocked down, the activity of cardiac myocytes under prolonged hypoxia decreased and the phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases increased during the re-oxygenation process (after 72h of hypoxia). Together, these results indicate that activating transcription factor 6α plays a pivotal role in myocardial adaptation to chronic hypoxia and that the activation of activating transcription factor 6α is one possible mechanism of myocardial preconditioning.

Abstract: Laser micro-welding is a technique that can be used for interconnective (P2) patterning of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells after deposition of the ZnO:Al window layer. The micro-welding process transforms CIGS into a conductive compound that forms a contact between the ZnO:Al front contact and the Mo back contact. In this work we present a study on the influence of process parameters on the interconnectivity of the laser micro-weld as well as an investigation of the morphology of the micro-weld zone. We found that the current method results in an overlap of conditions where electrical connection is achieved and where Mo/glass damage is caused by laser action. Stability testing shows that interconnections processed without appreciable damage are stable. The connecting region contained metal rich zones and segregated CuxSe that we believe account for its conductivity.

Abstract: Planar photonic concentrators are a promising concept for low-cost building integrated photovoltaic. In this work, they are formed from colloidal photonic crystal layers deposited by the Langmuir–Blodgett technique onto clear polymethylacrylate sheets with a solar cell attached to the edge. Light is scattered into a waveguide mode and guided via total internal reflection to the edge mounted solar cell. Transmission and reflection measurements taken in different geometries strongly indicate an increased scattering of the incident light over a wide range of wavelengths, depending on the size of the beads forming the photonic crystal film. IV measurements on solar cells attached to one side of a sheet with 8 layers of 250nm beads exhibit a relative increase in efficiency by a factor of up to 3 as compared to the blank PMMA sheet. These concentrators can increase the power output from photovoltaic cells without the need for solar tracking and have the potential of achieving a lifetime matching standard silicon solar cells.

Abstract: In the present study, we introduce a method for preparing textured zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films by hydrogen associated magnetron sputtering. The improved surface morphology and structure characteristic indicate that hydrogen could efficiently mediate the crystal orientation by playing an important role in influencing the surface diffusion and sticking processes. This textured surface morphology leads to a high haze factor which provides effective light trapping efficiency. In addition, the electrical properties of ZnO films are also enhanced with high carrier concentration and mobility. Layers with comparable electrical (sheet resistance <5Ω/sq), optical (average total transmittance >80% from 400nm to 1200nm) and morphological (RMS>50nm) properties to Asahi U-type fluorine doped tin dioxide (FTO) have been obtained. Preliminary microcrystalline silicon solar cells deposited on self-textured ZnO show 13.2% and 20% enhancement in short-circuit current density and efficiency, respectively, illustrating a good potential application in mass production for large area expansibility.

Abstract: The advantage of dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole compared to the benzothiadiazole moiety of PCDTBT is to improve the solubility of the polymer while keeping the 1,2-quinoid form to lead coplanarity of the backbone. New random copolymers, to broaden the absorption range for the wider coverage of the solar spectrum, were synthesized by Stille coupling reactions to generate PFDTMBIs (or PFBBTMBIs). The PFDTMBIs in solid films show two maxima peaks at about 420–427 and 626–641nm. The solid films of PFBBTMBIs show absorption bands with two maximum peaks at about 443–452 and 643–652nm which are red-shifted about 20nm as compared to PFDTMBIs, which is caused by the introduction of more rigid bithiophene unit in their polymer backbones to improve the photocurrents. The device with PFBBTMBI5:PC61BM blend demonstrated a VOC value of 0.68V, a JSC value of 3.10mA/cm2, and an FF of 0.35, leading to the efficiency of 0.74%.

Abstract: Advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) technology and supportive care techniques have led to improvements in long-term survival after HCT. Emerging indications for transplantation, introduction of newer graft sources (eg, umbilical cord blood) and transplantation of older patients using less intense conditioning regimens have also contributed to an increase in the number of HCT survivors. These survivors are at risk for developing late complications secondary to pre-, peri-, and posttransplantation exposures and risk factors. Guidelines for screening and preventive practices for HCT survivors were published in 2006. An international group of transplantation experts was convened in 2011 to review contemporary literature and update the recommendations while considering the changing practice of transplantation and international applicability of these guidelines. This review provides the updated recommendations for screening and preventive practices for pediatric and adult survivors of autologous and allogeneic HCT.

Abstract: Dimethylformamide (DMF), an organic solvent, was used to treat the poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) layer in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) polymer solar cells, resulting in significant enhancement of photocurrent and power conversion efficiency (PCE) improvement by 70%. Analyses of I–V characteristics reveal that the change in the active layer rather than that of the PEDOT: PSS buffer layer is ascribed to performance improvement. AFM images indicate that the roughness of PEDOT: PSS layer has been increased after the treatment. We argue that the protrudent PEDOT: PSS could serve as the centers for an initial crystallization of P3HT chains leading to a better alignment of P3HT: PCBM domains for a greatly enhanced photocurrent.

Abstract: Two of the methods of exceeding the detailed balance limit for a single junction solar cell are down-converting high energy photons to produce two photons and carrier multiplication, whereby high energy photons produce more than one electron–hole pair. Both methods obey the conservation of energy in similar ways, and effectively produce a higher current in the solar cell. Due to this similarity, it has been assumed in the literature that there is no thermodynamic difference between the two methods. Here, we analyzed the two methods using a generalized approach based on Kirchhoff's law of radiation and develop a new model for carrier multiplication. We demonstrate that there is an entropic penalty to be paid for attempting to accomplish all-in-one splitting in carrier multiplication systems, giving a small thermodynamic – and therefore efficiency – advantage to spectral splitting prior to reaching the solar cell. We show this analytically using a derivation of basic thermodynamic identities; numerically by solving for the maximal efficiency; and generally using heat-generation arguments. Our result provides a new limit of entropy generation in solar cells beyond the existing literature, and a new distinction among 3rd generation photovoltaic technologies.

Abstract: In this study, we explored the role of Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) on the expression of P450 2E1 and related ROS production. P450 2E1 protein, not mRNA, was expressed at relatively low levels in BI-1 plasmid-transfected cells (BI-1 cells) compared with neomycin-resistant vector-transfected cells (Neo cells). When exposed to ER stress, P450 2E1 expression and activity and ER membrane lipid peroxidation increased in both Neo cells and BI-1 cells, but to a lesser degree in BI-1 cells. This observation correlated with the lower level of ER stress in BI-1 cells than Neo cells. To examine the BI-1-associated P450 2E1 degradation mechanism, cells were treated with the lysosome inhibitor, bafilomycin and the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Bafilomycin recovered the reduced P450 2E1 expression in BI-1 cells, but did not affect P450 2E1 expression in Neo cells. Next, proteosomal and lysosomal activities in Neo cells were compared to those in BI-1 cells. Although proteosomal activity was similar between Neo and BI-1 cells, LysoTracker and acridine orange labeling, lysosomal V-ATPase activity, and lysosomal cathepsin B expression were higher in BI-1 cells than in Neo cells. In the presence of ER stress, lysosomal activities decreased in Neo cells but did not change in BI-1 cells. P450 2E1 expression and ER membrane lipid peroxidation were greater in the hepatocytes and livers of BI-1 knock-out mice than in BI-1 wild-type cells and mice. Our results suggest that the BI-1-mediated enhancement of lysosomal activity regulates P450 2E1 expression and resultant ROS accumulation.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins are a rather heterogeneous family of ATP-independent chaperones, some of which have been proven to block protein aggregation and help the cells to survive stressful conditions. Although much less studied than high molecular weight HSPs like HSP70/HSPA or HSP90/HSPC, their implication in physio-pathological processes and human diseases is now well evidenced, as it will be discussed in the different reviews of this special issue. In this mini-review we will just present a general introduction about the small heat shock proteins family. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Small HSPs in physiology and pathology.

Abstract: In this work we use a modified equivalent circuit to simulate the S-shape found in current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of organic solar cells (OSC) based on P3HT:PCBM. The modification of the traditional model includes a second diode opposite to the main one together with a parallel resistance, RP2. The transcendental equation derived from the circuit is solved exactly without approximations. The S-shape (so called kink), usually attributed to a poor quality of polymer/cathode interface, can be removed after three slow annealing treatments. The evolution of the J–V curves with the annealing process has been quantified by extracting the equivalent circuit parameters of each curve (pristine and annealed) by fitting the model to the experimental data. Results show that kink annihilation is mostly due to a strong decrease of RP2, which diminishes the reverse diode effect on the J–V curve.

Abstract: Two low band gap copolymers (PQTDPP and PQTVTDPP) having quaterthiophene (QT) or bithiophene-vinylene-bithiophene (QTVT) as donor unit and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as acceptor unit have been synthesized via Stille cross-coupling polymerization. The polymers showed high thermal stability and broad light absorption with optical band gaps around 1.3eV. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of QT and DPP copolymer (PQTDPP) were found to be −5.19 and −3.64eV, respectively and those of PQTVTDPP −5.05 and −3.66eV, respectively. X-ray diffraction patterns showed highly crystalline phase in the PQTDPP film and nearly amorphous in the PQTVTDPP film. This dramatic difference in crystallinity was attributed to the structural isomerization around vinyl groups in the PQTVTDPP polymer. Field-effect transistor measurement revealed that the PQTDPP showed high hole mobility of 0.06cm2/Vs and on/off ratio of 106 while the PQTVTDPP showed hole mobility of 3.57×10−4cm2/Vs and on/off ratio of 105, which is consistent with X-ray diffraction results. Photovoltaic devices were also fabricated using polymer:PCBM blends in the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend/Al. The PQTDPP devices exhibited an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.58V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 7.16mA/cm2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.55 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.28%, and the PQTVTDPP devices exhibited an Voc of 0.50V, a Jsc of 7.60mA/cm2, a FF of 0.51 and a PCE of 1.97% under AM 1.5 illumination.

Due to its unique geometry, the MW array had an enlarged junction area, enabling efficient carrier collection and optical reflectance in the wavelength range from 400 to 1000nm, which is lower than that of its planar counterpart. Despite these advantages, the energy conversion efficiency (CE) of the MW array solar cell (3.2%) was lower than that of a planar solar cell (4.2%). This comparative study clearly reveals the inherent potential of MW-based solar cells and the importance of extrinsic trap state control to realize low-cost, high-efficiency devices.

Abstract: Photon Enhanced Thermionic Emission (PETE) is a recently proposed novel concept in solar energy conversion, combining thermal and photovoltaic carrier excitation with thermionic emission. A recent study has shown that PETE conversion efficiencies can theoretically rise above 40% at concentration of 1000 suns. We analyze two major aspects missing from previous treatment of PETE conversion efficiency: changes in the cathode's conduction band carrier concentration with the electrical operating point; and determination of the cathode temperature from a full thermal energy balance. The results show that the conversion efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of temperature, and a monotonically decreasing function of the cathode electron affinity. It is shown that PETE converter efficiency according to the modified model is higher than previously reported, but achieving very high efficiencies of over 40% requires high temperatures that may be difficult in practical implementation.

Abstract: The new eutectic composition in the LiNO3–NaNO3–KNO3 ternary salt system has a very low melting point (118°C) and is a potential candidate for use in parabolic trough solar power generation. The short and long-term thermal stabilities and reliability of the eutectic composition in this ternary system were determined using the Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), respectively. The system demonstrates excellent short-term thermal stability and reliability during thermal cycling. However, the system showed 8% weight loss during long-term thermal stability test. Long-term isothermal stepwise study reveals that below 435°C the weight change is minimal and this temperature is taken as the upper limit of thermal stability of the system. The eutectic composition in the ternary system was characterized by XRD and SEM techniques before and after the thermal stability experiments to identify the morphology and compositions of the phases. From the present study it can be concluded that the major contributor to the weight loss is the dissociation of lithium nitrate to lithium oxides.

Abstract: We report on thermal-annealing-free inverted polymer solar cells using ZnO nanoparticles (NPs)/Cs2CO3 bilayer as an electron-selective layer (ESL) and the blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): phenyl C61-butryricacid methyl ester(PCBM) as an active light-absorbing layer. These layers were deposited via solution process without additional thermal treatment. The cell gave power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.81%, which was higher by about 40% or 80% than that of the cell with single ZnO NPs or Cs2CO3 ESL, respectively. This improved performance could be attributed to the bilayer-structure ESL, whose electron-extraction and leakage-current-suppression abilities were enhanced due to its modified energy level and improved surface morphology. PCE of this device remained 92% of its original value after storage of the as-fabricated device in a N2-filled glove box for 80 day. Furthermore, when the blend of poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)]: [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester replaced P3HT:PCBM as the active layer, higher PCE of 6.45% was achieved in the corresponding cell.

Abstract: The lifetime of organic solar cells (OSCs) is a key point that has to be addressed to allow their commercial development. Ultra-barrier organic/inorganic multilayer encapsulation therefore has to be developed to improve OSC stability. Polymer nanocomposites are good candidates to be used as the organic layer in the multilayered structure. We report here an optimization of MMt-Na+ content up to 10wt% in PVA nanocomposite to obtain the properties required for organic solar cell encapsulation, namely an exfoliated structure that has high gas barrier properties, transparency, wettability and planarity of the surface. The elaboration of these nanocomposites was performed through an environmentally friendly process in aqueous solution. The distribution of MMt-Na+ in PVA was first investigated, and the results showed that the transparency of the nanocomposite films was not affected by the presence of the clay in the visible region (400–700nm). The morphology of nanocomposites was also investigated. A good distribution of the MMt-Na+ in PVA, with intercalated and exfoliated structures, was observed, especially for concentrations up to 5wt%. Surface properties were also explored and it was shown that PVA/MMt-Na+ 5% nanocomposite permitted to obtain an improvement in wettability without increasing too much the surface roughness. Subsequently, the permeability of the nanocomposites was investigated and it was shown that 5wt% of MMt-Na+ improved the helium permeability (by 70%) and also oxygen and water permeability. Finally, PVA/MMt-Na+ 5wt% nanocomposite layer was used as encapsulation for organic solar cells and the improvement of the OSCs stability was evidenced. This work allowed selecting optimized nanocomposites with clay content up to 5wt%, which will be incorporated into multilayer encapsulation structure to have the best compromise between the different required properties and to enhance organic solar cells stability.

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a new series connection method that employs alternating conventional and inverted bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The two adjacent cells in each submodule are connected through top or bottom ‘continuous terminals’ made of aluminum or indium tin oxide (ITO), which are shared by cells with different polarities in either a top-to-top or a bottom-to-bottom manner. In comparison with the conventional series-interconnection method, our new structure offers unique advantages in that both printing methods and efficient coating methods can be applied in the manufacturing of series-connected BHJ photovoltaic modules.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the common progenitors of osteoblasts and adipocytes. A reciprocal relationship exists between osteogenesis and adipogenesis in the bone marrow, and the identification of signaling pathways that stimulate MSC osteogenesis at the expense of adipogenesis is of great importance from the viewpoint of developing new therapeutic treatments for bone loss. The adipogenic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) has been reported to play a vital role in modulating mesenchymal lineage allocation within the bone marrow compartment, stimulating adipocyte development at the expense of osteoblast differentiation. Hence, PPARγ may be a valuable target for drugs intended to enhance bone mass. However, little direct evidence is available for the role played by PPARγ in human mesenchymal lineage allocation. In this study, using human MSCs as an in vitro model, we showed that the two isoforms of PPARγ, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, were differentially induced during hMSC adipogenesis, whereas only PPARγ1 was detected during osteogenesis. BADGE and GW9662, two potential antagonists of PPARγ, as well as lentivirus-mediated knockdown of PPARγ, inhibited hMSC adipogenesis but did not significantly affect osteogenesis. PPARγ knockdown did not significantly influence the expression level of the osteogenic transcription factor Runx2. Together, these results suggest that PPARγ is not the master factor regulating mesenchymal lineage determination in human bone marrow.

Abstract: SNARE complex mediates cellular membrane fusion events essential for neurotransmitter release and synaptogenesis. SNAP25, a member of the SNARE proteins, plays critical roles during the development of the central nervous system via regulation by alternative splicing and protein kinase phosphorylation. To date, little information is available regarding the protein in the spinal cord regeneration, especially for the postnatal highly expressed isoform SNAP25b. In the present study, we characterized gecko SNAP25b, which shared high identity with those of other vertebrates. Expression of gecko SNAP25b was temporally upregulated in both neurons of spinal cord and forming ependymal tube following tail amputation, coinciding with the occurrence of regenerate re-innervation. Overexpression of gecko wild type SNAP25b in the SH-SY5Y and undifferentiated PC12 cells promoted the elongation and outgrowth of neurites, while mutant constructs at Serine187 resulted in differential effects for which S187A had a promoting role. Knockdown of endogenous SNAP25b affected the formation of neurites, which could be rescued by overexpression of SNAP25b. FM1-43 staining revealed that transfection of S187E mutant construct reduced the recruitment of vesicles. In addition, transfection of gecko SNAP25b in the astrocyte, which is absent from neuronal specific VAMP2, was capable of enhancing process elongation, indicating a potential for various alternative protein combinations. Taken together, our data suggest that gecko SNAP25b is involved in spinal cord regeneration by promoting outgrowth and elongation of neurites in a more extensive protein binding manner.

Metabolic effects of vitamin D active metabolites in monolayer and micromass cultures of nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus cells isolated from human intervertebral disc,

Abstract: Intragenic polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor gene are linked to disc degeneration features, suggesting that alterations in the vitamer-mediated signalling could be involved in the pathophysiology of the disc and that interaction of disc cells with vitamin D metabolites may be critical for disc health. The vitamer-mediated modulation of disc cells proliferation, metabolic activity, extracellular matrix (ECM) genes expression and proteins production was investigated. It was stated that disc cells express vitamin D receptor and are very sensitive to metabolic stimuli. In monolayer cultures, 1,25(OH)2D3, but not 24,25(OH)2D3, determined an inhibition of the proliferation and regulated also the ECM genes expression in nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus cells. Micromass cultures induced a more physiologic expression pattern of extracellular matrix genes. Cells Treatment with vitamin D metabolites did not result in relevant modifications of glycosaminoglycans production, except for annulus cells, whose production was reduced after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. Moreover, a reduced glycosaminoglycans staining in both cell types and a significant reduced aggrecan gene expression in annulus cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 were observed. A reduction of collagen I and II staining in annulus cells 1,25(OH)2D3 treated, in accordance with a downregulation of collagen genes expression, was also registered. Finally, the vitamin D receptor gene expression did not show significant metabolite-mediated modification in monolayer or micromass cultures. These findings could enhance new insights on the biochemical mechanisms regulated by vitamin D in disc cartilage and possibly involved in the development of physiological/pathological modifications of the disc.

Mitochondrial chaperone DnaJA3 induces Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation,

Abstract: Mitochondrial morphology is dynamic and controlled by coordinated fusion and fission pathways. The role of mitochondrial chaperones in mitochondrial morphological changes and pathology is currently unclear. Here we report that altered levels of DnaJA3 (Tid1/mtHsp40) a mitochondrial member of the DnaJ protein family, and heat shock protein (Hsp) co-chaperone of matrix 70kDa Hsp70 (mtHsp70/mortalin/HSPA9), induces mitochondrial fragmentation. Suppression of DnaJA3 induced mitochondrial fragmentation in HeLa cells. Elevated levels of DnaJA3 in normal Hs68 fibroblast cells and HeLa, SKN-SH, U87 and U251 cancer cell lines induces mitochondrial fragmentation. Mitochondrial fragmentation induction was not observed in HeLa cells when other DnaJA family members, or mitochondrial DnaJ protein HSC20, were ectopically expressed, indicating that the effects on mitochondrial morphology were specific to DnaJA3. We show that the DnaJ domain (amino acids 88–168) of DnaJA3 is sufficient for the induction of mitochondrial fragmentation. Furthermore, an H121Q point mutation of the DnaJ domain, which abrogates interaction and activation of mtHsp70 ATPase, eliminates fragmentation induced by DnaJA3. This suggests that DnaJA3 interaction with mtHsp70 may be critical in mitochondrial morphological changes. DnaJA3-induced mitochondrial fragmentation was dependent on fission factor dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Ectopic expression of the mitofusins (Mfn1 and Mfn2), however, does not rescue DnaJA3-induced mitochondrial fragmentation. Lastly, elevated levels of DnaJA3 inducing mitochondrial fragmentation were associated with reduction in cell viability. Taken together, elevated DnaJA3 induces Drp1-depedendent mitochondrial fragmentation and decreased cell viability.

Abstract: We report a novel transparent electrode structure made of Ag–Ni bilayer on polyethylene terephtalate (PET) substrates. However, without any adequate countermeasure, such an ultrathin layer would uninvitedly oxidize even at ambient conditions due to permeation of moisture and oxygen through the polymer substrates. A combination of heat and Ar plasma pretreatment was found to significantly increase the stability of the metals layers deposited onto polymer substrates. The 1nm Ni capping layer provides higher work function together with stability to the underlying Ag conducting layer over time and in harsh conditions of 85°C and 85% relative humidity. The obtained Ag–Ni bilayer ultrathin films show average transparency of 75% in the visible region and sheet resistance of 11Ω/sq. To demonstrate its operational potential, the electrode has been used as the transparent anode in an organic solar cell (OSC), which shows an overall photon conversion efficiency of >90% of the indium tin oxide (ITO) based cell which was measured to be 2.67%. With respect to ITO, the proposed transparent electrode has several advantages, including mechanical flexibility, room temperature processing and low cost.

Abstract: High irradiance IV-measurements on a CPV GaAs cell with an (Al0.4Ga0.6)0.52In0.48P back surface field revealed some unusual characteristics. With increasing irradiance, an anomaly appeared in the high voltage section of the IV-curve. The anomaly disappeared at sufficiently high temperatures. Because the layer structure of the studied GaAs solar cell is not uncommon, this effect could be more widespread among concentrator cells and is, therefore, of interest to the CPV community. It was demonstrated that the effect is due to a back surface field-related energy barrier and can be avoided by using an Al0.2Ga0.8As back surface field with a higher doping level. The behavior of the anomaly as a function of temperature seems to be in agreement with the mechanism of thermionic emission of current over an internal energy barrier. This mechanism, however, does not explain the irradiance-dependent occurrence of the anomaly.

Abstract: In this study, xylitol pentastearate and xylitol pentapalmitate were synthesized as novel solid–liquid PCMs by an esterification reaction in order to eliminate the unfavorable thermal properties of xylitol (such as high melting point) and stearic and palmitic acids (such as high melting point, low corrosivity, bad odor, and sublimating property). The synthesized ester compounds were characterized chemically by using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy methods. By using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method, the melting temperatures of xylitol pentastearate and xylitol pentapalmitate were measured as 32.35°C and 18.75°C, respectively, while their latent heats of melting were determined as 205.65Jg−1 and 170.05Jg−1 respectively. These results indicate that the synthesized PCMs have high latent heat values and suitable phase change temperatures for thermal energy storage applications. The thermal cycling test shows that the synthesized PCMs have good thermal reliability after 1000 thermal cycles. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis results also reveal that the PCMs have good thermal stability over their working temperatures.

Abstract: In this work, it is shown that variations in the ratio of oxygen to zinc precursors at constant temperature allow changing the surface morphology of zinc oxide (ZnO) films deposited by low-pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, while keeping the sheet resistance and transparency of the layers constant. This allows developing ZnO layers combining interesting properties such as low surface roughness (below 15nm) and low sheet resistance (below 15Ω/⎕). More generally, it is shown that the pyramidal feature density can be controlled by tuning the precursor flows. This leads to film surfaces characterized by zones with a rough morphology mixed with zones with almost flat features. Therefore, by using this technique, the light-scattering ability of a film can be carefully tuned through its surface morphology without affecting the conductivity or transparency of the layer. This provides an efficient tool to optimize the front electrode of thin-film silicon solar cells to achieve the best possible combination of open-circuit voltage, fill factor and photo-generated current. The presented solution is an in-situ process achievable in standard deposition conditions making it easily up-scalable with existing production equipment.

Abstract: In this study, the physical and chemical degradation behaviors of active layers based on semicrystalline p-type polymer (poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)) and [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl-ester (PC71BM) are compared with the corresponding behaviors of amorphous p-type polymer of poly[N-9″-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) and PC71BM. A surface morphological study of the active layer (from Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images) and a chemical analysis (from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results) help explain why PCDTBT/PC71BM bulk heterojunction (BHJ) has a higher level of long-term stability under thermal and air stability experimental conditions than a P3HT/PC71BM-based BHJ. The power conversion efficiency for a PCDTBT/PC71BM BHJ cell and a P3HT/PC71BM BHJ cell decreased by 11% and 21%, respectively, after a thermal stability test and by 68% and 78%, respectively, after a 300h air stability test.
