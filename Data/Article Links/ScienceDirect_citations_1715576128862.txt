Abstract: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) fine-tune gene expression by modulating RNA stability, translation, and degradation. RBPs are involved in the development of endometrial cancer. In particular, Y-box-binding protein 2 (YBX2), a germ cell-specific member of the YBX family, has been reported to maintain cancer stem cell-like phenotypes in endometrial cancer. However, the mechanism by which YBX2 modulates mRNA stability in endometrial cancer cells remains unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of the ectopic expression of YBX2 in endometrial adenocarcinoma-derived Ishikawa cells. We found that elevated levels of YBX2 delayed cell proliferation, without increasing cell apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed disturbances in gene expression caused by YBX2. Interestingly, heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 6 (HSPA6) levels were downregulated due to the reduced mRNA stability after YBX2 binding. YBX2 facilitated the formation of relatively stable cytoplasmic granules in tumor cells via its mRNA binding domain. Moreover, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) reader proteins are recruited by YBX2 granules via the cold-shock domain. Notably, knockdown of YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA-binding protein F2 (YTHDF2), an m6A reader, ameliorated the reduction in HSPA6 mRNA levels induced by YBX2, indicating the synergistic effects of YBX2 and YTHDF2 on mRNA stability. Therefore, YBX2 regulates RNA stability by interacting with the m6A reader proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The testis is an immune-privileged organ. It is considered that the testis somatic microenvironment is responsible for immune suppression. However, immunological properties of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have remained unknown. Here, we report the birth of allogeneic offspring by enhanced expression of immunosuppressive PD-L1 in SSCs. In vitro supplementation of GDNF and FGF2 increased expression of PD-L1 in SSCs. Cultured SSCs maintained allogeneic spermatogenesis that persisted for >1 year. However, depletion or gene editing of Pd-l1 family genes in SSCs prevented allogeneic spermatogenesis, which suggested that germ cells are responsible for suppression of the allogeneic response. PD-L1 was induced by activation of the MAPK14-BCL6B pathway, which drives self-renewal by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. By contrast, reduced ROS or Mapk14 deficiency downregulated PD-L1. Allogeneic offspring were born after SSC transplantation into congenitally infertile and chemically castrated mice. Thus, SSCs have unique immunological properties, which make allogeneic recipients into “surrogate fathers.”

Abstract: Cellular stress and inflammation contribute to the initiation and progression of a variety of pulmonary diseases. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and its main regulator GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa) appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases, and GRP78 was found to be a biomarker in a wide range of inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the relevance of serum GRP78 in pulmonary disorders. In this prospective cohort study, 78 consecutive patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, n = 28), asthma (n = 38) or interstitial lung disease (ILD, n = 12) underwent measurement of serum GRP78 levels by ELISA. The mean age of patients was 59.8±12.4 years, 48.7% were female. Patients with elevated GRP78 levels (> median) offered a significantly better oxygenation status (capillary pO2: 75.3±11.7 mmHg vs. 67.8±15.9 mmHg, p = 0.02). Significant correlations were observed between GRP78, on the one hand, and haemoglobin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and eosinophil counts, on the other hand (haemoglobin: Pearson’s r = −0.25, hs-CRP: r = 0.30, eosinophils: r = 0.63). Subsequently, we evaluated GRP78 measurements in function of severity stratifiers of the specific underlying pulmonary disease. ILD patients with a severe diffusion impairment (DLCO< 40% of predicted), exhibited a significant decrease in GRP78 levels (p = 0.01). In COPD and asthma, both characterized by obstructive ventilatory defects, a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) <30% of predicted was accompanied by significantly lower GRP78 (p = 0.0075). In both obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disorders, GRP78 protein concentrations were reduced with increasing disease severity. These data suggest a prevalent role of GRP78 in the presently studied pulmonary disorders.

Abstract: There are few effective therapies for small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC); thus, we need to develop novel and efficacious treatments. We hypothesized that an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) could be a promising option for SCLC. Several publicly available databases were used to demonstrate the extent to which junctional adhesion molecule 3 (JAM3) mRNA was expressed in SCLC and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and tissues. Three SCLC cell lines, Lu-135, SBC-5, and Lu-134 A, were selected and examined for JAM3 protein expression by flow cytometry. Finally, we examined the response of the three SCLC cell lines to a conjugate between an anti-JAM3 monoclonal antibody HSL156 (developed in-house) and the recombinant protein DT3C, which consists of diphtheria toxin lacking the receptor-binding domain but containing the C1, C2, and C3 domains of streptococcal protein G. In silico analyses revealed that JAM3 mRNA was expressed higher in SCLC cell lines and tissues than in those of lung adenocarcinoma. As expected, all the three SCLC cell lines examined were positive for JAM3 at the mRNA and protein levels. Consequently, control SCLC cells, but not JAM3-silenced ones, were highly sensitive to HSL156-DT3C conjugates, resulting in dose- and time-dependent decreased viability. Finally, silencing JAM3 alone suppressed the growth of all SCLC cell lines examined. Taken together, these findings suggest that an ADC targeting JAM3 could represent a new approach to treating SCLC patients.

Abstract: Summary
Although breast cancer mortality is largely caused by metastasis, clinical decisions are based on analysis of the primary tumor and on lymph node involvement but not on the phenotype of disseminated cells. Here, we use multiplex imaging mass cytometry to compare single-cell phenotypes of primary breast tumors and matched lymph node metastases in 205 patients. We observe extensive phenotypic variability between primary and metastatic sites and that disseminated cell phenotypes frequently deviate from the clinical disease subtype. We identify single-cell phenotypes and spatial organizations of disseminated tumor cells that are associated with patient survival and a weaker survival association for high-risk phenotypes in the primary tumor. We show that p53 and GATA3 in lymph node metastases provide prognostic information beyond clinical classifiers and can be measured with standard methods. Molecular characterization of disseminated tumor cells is an untapped source of clinically applicable prognostic information for breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cells can undergo continuous self-renewal and meanwhile retain the stemness capability to differentiate to mature functional cells. However, it is unclear whether the proliferation property can be segregated from the stemness in stem cells. The intestinal epithelium undergoes fast renewal, and the Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are essential to maintain homeostasis. Here, we report that methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3), a critical enzyme for N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, is required for ISCs maintenance as its deletion results in fast loss of stemness markers but has no effect on cell proliferation. We further identify four m6A-modified transcriptional factors, whose ectopic expression can restore stemness gene expression in Mettl3−/− organoids, while their silencing leads to stemness loss. In addition, transcriptomic profiling analysis discerns 23 genes that can be segregated from the genes responsible for cell proliferation. Together, these data reveal that m6A modification sustains ISC stemness, which can be uncoupled from cell proliferation.

Abstract: Aberrantly activated mTOR signaling pathway is commonly found in malignancies including gastric cancer (GC). DEPTOR, as a naturally occurred inhibitor of mTOR, functions in the pro- or anti-tumor manner depending on distinct tumor contexts. However, the roles of DEPTOR in GC remain largely unknown. In this study, DEPTOR expression was identified to be significantly decreased in GC tissues compared with matched normal gastric tissues, and reduced DEPTOR level was indicative of poor prognosis in patients. Restored DEPTOR expression inhibited the propagation in AGS and NCI–N87 cells, whose DEPTOR levels are low, via deactivating mTOR signaling pathway. Likewise, cabergoline (CAB) attenuated the proliferation in AGS and NCI–N87 cells via partially rescuing DEPTOR protein level. Targeted metabolomics analysis showed that several key metabolites, such as l-serine, significantly changed in AGS cells with DEPTOR restoration. These results revealed the anti-proliferation function of DEPTOR in GC cells, suggesting that restored DEPTOR expression using CAB may be a potential therapeutic approach for patients with GC.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of function (LoF) of TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and mis-localization, together with TDP-43-positive and hyperphosphorylated inclusions, are found in post-mortem tissue of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients, including those carrying LoF variants in the progranulin gene (GRN). Modeling TDP-43 pathology has been challenging in vivo and in vitro. We present a three-dimensional induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived paradigm—mature brain organoids (mbOrg)—composed of cortical-like-astrocytes (iA) and neurons. When devoid of GRN, mbOrgs spontaneously recapitulate TDP-43 mis-localization, hyperphosphorylation, and LoF phenotypes. Mixing and matching genotypes in mbOrgs showed that GRN−/− iA are drivers for TDP-43 pathology. Finally, we rescued TDP-43 LoF by adding exogenous progranulin, demonstrating a link between TDP-43 LoF and progranulin expression. In conclusion, we present an iPSC-derived platform that shows striking features of human TDP-43 proteinopathy and provides a tool for the mechanistic modeling of TDP-43 pathology and patient-tailored therapeutic screening for FTD and ALS.

Abstract: It is recognized that the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury triggers inflammatory activation of microglia and supports microglia-driven neuronal damage. Our previous studies have shown that ginsenoside Rg1 had a significant protective effect on focal cerebral I/R injury in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. However, the mechanism still needs further clarification. Here, we firstly reported that ginsenoside Rg1 effectively suppressed the inflammatory activation of brain microglia cells under I/R conditions depending on the inhibition of Toll-likereceptor4 (TLR4) proteins. In vivo experiments showed that the ginsenoside Rg1 administration could significantly improve the cognitive function of MCAO rats, and in vitro experimental data showed that ginsenoside Rg1 significantly alleviated neuronal damage via inhibiting the inflammatory response in microglia cells co-cultured under oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) condition in gradient dependent. The mechanism study showed that the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 depends on the suppression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and TLR4/TRIF/IRF-3 pathways in microglia cells. In a word, our research shows that ginsenoside Rg1 has great application potential in attenuating the cerebral I/R injury by targeting TLR4 protein in the microglia cells.

Abstract: Summary
When damaged, restoring the function of the hypothalamus is currently impossible. It is unclear whether neural stem cells exist in the hypothalamus. Studies have reported that adult rodent tanycytes around the third ventricle function as hypothalamic neural stem cell-like cells. However, it is currently impossible to collect periventricular cells from humans. We attempted to generate hypothalamic neural stem cell-like cells from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We focused on retina and anterior neural fold homeobox (RAX) because its expression is gradually restricted to tanycytes during the late embryonic stage. We differentiated RAX::VENUS knockin human ESCs (hESCs) into hypothalamic organoids and sorted RAX+ cells from mature organoids. The isolated RAX+ cells formed neurospheres and exhibited self-renewal and multipotency. Neurogenesis was observed when neurospheres were transplanted into the mouse hypothalamus. We isolated RAX+ hypothalamic neural stem cell-like cells from wild-type human ES organoids. This is the first study to differentiate human hypothalamic neural stem cell-like cells from pluripotent stem cells.

Abstract: Endothelial cell senescence is involved in endothelial dysfunction and aging-related vascular diseases. The D1-like dopamine receptor (DR1), a number of G-protein-coupled receptors, is currently under consideration as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of atherosclerosis. However, the role of DR1 in regulating ox-LDL-stimulated endothelial cell senescence remains unknown. Here, we found that the elevated Prx hyperoxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in ox-LDL-treated Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were observed, suppressed by DR1 agonist SKF38393. Increased proportion of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) positive staining cells and activated p16/p21/p53 pathway in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs were significantly abolished by DR1 activation. In addition, SKF38393 increased the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) at serine-133, nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and expression of HO-1 in HUVECs. In contrast, adding H-89, a PKA inhibitor, diminished the effects of DR1 activation. Further studies performed with DR1 siRNA confirmed that DR1 was involved in CREB/Nrf2 pathway. Taken together, DR1 activation reduces ROS production and cell senescence by upregulating CREB/Nrf2 antioxidant signaling in ox-LDL-induced endothelial cells. Thus, DR1 could be a potential molecular target to counteract oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence.

Abstract: Summary
Ancestral SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and variants of concern (VOC) caused a global pandemic with a spectrum of disease severity. The mechanistic explaining variations related to airway epithelium are relatively understudied. Here, we biobanked airway organoids (AO) by preserving stem cell function. We optimized viral infection with H1N1/PR8 and comprehensively characterized epithelial responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in phenotypically stable AO from 20 different subjects. We discovered Tetraspanin-8 (TSPAN8) as a facilitator of SARS-CoV-2 infection. TSPAN8 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection rates independently of ACE2-Spike interaction. In head-to-head comparisons with Ancestral SARS-CoV-2, Delta and Omicron VOC displayed lower overall infection rates of AO but triggered changes in epithelial response. All variants shared highest tropism for ciliated and goblet cells. TSPAN8-blocking antibodies diminish SARS-CoV-2 infection and may spur novel avenues for COVID-19 therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Immunometabolism in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its influence on the immunotherapy response remain uncertain in colorectal cancer (CRC). We perform immunometabolism subtyping (IMS) on CRC patients in the training and validation cohorts. Three IMS subtypes of CRC, namely, C1, C2, and C3, are identified with distinct immune phenotypes and metabolic properties. The C3 subtype exhibits the poorest prognosis in both the training cohort and the in-house validation cohort. The single-cell transcriptome reveals that a S100A9+ macrophage population contributes to the immunosuppressive TME in C3. The dysfunctional immunotherapy response in the C3 subtype can be reversed by combination treatment with PD-1 blockade and an S100A9 inhibitor tasquinimod. Taken together, we develop an IMS system and identify an immune tolerant C3 subtype that exhibits the poorest prognosis. A multiomics-guided combination strategy by PD-1 blockade and tasquinimod improves responses to immunotherapy by depleting S100A9+ macrophages in vivo.

Abstract: MTHFD1L, a key enzyme of folate metabolism, is seldom reported in cancer. In this study, we investigate the role of MTHFD1L in the tumorigenicity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). ESCC tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 177 samples from 109 patients were utilized to evaluate whether MTHFD1L expression, determined using immunohistochemical analysis, is a prognostic indicator for ESCC patients. The function of MTHFD1L in the migration and invasion of ESCC cells was studied with wound healing, Transwell, and three-dimensional spheroid invasion assays in vitro and a lung metastasis mouse model in vivo. The mRNA microarrays and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) were used to explore the downstream of MTHFD1L. Elevated expression of MTHFD1L in ESCC tissues was significantly associated with poor differentiation and prognosis. These phenotypic assays revealed that MTHFD1L significantly promote the viability and metastasis of ESCC cell in vivo and in vitro. Further detailed analyses of the molecular mechanism demonstrated that the ESCC progression driven by MTHFD1L was through up-regulation ERK5 signaling pathways. These findings reveal that MTHFD1L is positively associated with the aggressive phenotype of ESCC by activating ERK5 signaling pathways, suggesting that MTHFD1L is a new biomarker and a potential molecular therapeutic target for ESCC.

Abstract: Overactivation of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) is one of the main causes of myocardial fibrosis (MF), and inhibition of CF activation is a crucial strategy for MF therapy. A previous study by our group demonstrated that leonurine (LE) effectively inhibits collagen synthesis and myofibroblast generation originated from CFs, and eventually mitigates the progression of MF (where miR-29a-3p is likely to be a vital mediator). However, the underlying mechanisms involved in this process remain unknown. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the precise role of miR-29a-3p in LE-treated CFs, and to elucidate the pharmacological effects of LE on MF. Neonatal rat CFs were isolated and stimulated by angiotensin II (Ang II) to mimic the pathological process of MF in vitro. The results show that LE distinctly inhibits collagen synthesis, as well as the proliferation, differentiation and migration of CFs, all of which could be induced by Ang II. In addition, LE promotes apoptosis in CFs under Ang II stimulation. During this process, the down-regulated expressions of miR-29a-3p and p53 are partly restored by LE. Either knockdown of miR-29a-3p or inhibition of p53 by PFT-α (a p53 inhibitor) blocks the antifibrotic effect of LE. Notably, PFT-α suppresses miR-29a-3p levels in CFs under both normal and Ang II-treated conditions. Furthermore, ChIP analysis confirmed that p53 is bound to the promoter region of miR-29a-3p, and directly regulates its expression. Overall, our study demonstrates that LE upregulates p53 and miR-29a-3p expression, and subsequently inhibits CF overactivation, suggesting that the p53/miR-29a-3p axis may play a crucial role in mediating the antifibrotic effect of LE against MF.

For a long time, ex vivo-expanded peripheral-blood-derived γδT cell (PBγδT)-based immunotherapy has been attractive, and clinical trials have been undertaken. However, the difficulty in expanding cytotoxic γδT cells to an adequate number has been a major limitation to the efficacy of treatment in most cases. We successfully re-generated γδT cells from γδT cell-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The iPSC-derived γδT cells (iγδTs) killed several cancer types in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted manner. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that the iγδTs were identical to a minor subset of PBγδTs. Compared with a major subset of PBγδTs, the iγδTs showed a distinctive gene expression pattern: lower CD2, CD5, and antigen-presenting genes; higher CD7, KIT, and natural killer (NK) cell markers. The iγδTs expressed granzyme B and perforin but not interferon gamma (IFNγ). Our data provide a new source for γδT cell-based immunotherapy without quantitative limitation.

Abstract: Background
Endometriosis is a severe disease which is associated with excessive activation of pyroptosis. Our present research aimed to investigate the function of Forkhead Box A2 (FoxA2) in regulating pyroptosis in endometriosis.
Methods
IL-1β and IL-18 concentrations were assessed using ELISA. Cell pyroptosis was analyzed using flow cytometry. TUNEL staining was performed to determine human endometrial stromal cells (HESC) death. Moreover, ERβ mRNA stability was assessed using RNA degradation assay. Finally, the binding relationships between FoxA2, IGF2BP1 and ERβ were verified by dual-luciferase reporter system, ChIP, RIP and RNA pull-down assays.
Results
Our results revealed that IGF2BP1 and ERβ were significantly upregulated in ectopic endometrium (EC) tissues of endometriosis patients compared to that in eutopic endometrium (EU) tissues as well as IL-18 and IL-1β levels. Loss-of-function experiments subsequently demonstrated that either IGF2BP1 knockdown or ERβ knockdown could repress HESC pyroptosis. In addition, IGF2BP1 upregulation promoted the pyroptosis in endometriosis by binding to ERβ and promoting ERβ mRNA stability. Our further research displayed that FoxA2 upregulation suppressed HESC pyroptosis by interacting with IGF2BP1 promoter.
Conclusion
Our research proved that FoxA2 upregulation downregulated ERβ by transcriptionally inhibiting IGF2BP1, thereby repressing pyroptosis in endometriosis.

L-asparaginase anti-tumor activity in pancreatic cancer is dependent on its glutaminase activity and resistance is mediated by glutamine synthetase,

Abstract: l-Asparaginase is a cornerstone of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy since lymphoblasts lack asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and rely on extracellular asparagine availability for survival. Resistance mechanisms are associated with increased ASNS expression in ALL. However, the association between ASNS and l-Asparaginase efficacy in solid tumors remains unclear, thus limiting clinical development. Interestingly, l-Asparaginase also has a glutaminase co-activity that is crucial in pancreatic cancer where KRAS mutations activate glutamine metabolism. By developing l-Asparaginase-resistant pancreatic cancer cells and using OMICS approaches, we identified glutamine synthetase (GS) as a marker of resistance to l-Asparaginase. GS is the only enzyme able to synthesize glutamine, and its expression also correlates with l-Asparaginase efficacy in 27 human cell lines from 11 cancer indications. Finally, we further demonstrated that GS inhibition prevents cancer cell adaptation to l-Asparaginase-induced glutamine starvation. These findings could pave the way to the development of promising drug combinations to overcome l-Asparaginase resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging Omicron sub-variants are causing global concerns, and their immune evasion should be monitored continuously. We previously evaluated the escape of Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 from an atlas of 50 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), covering seven epitope classes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor-binding domain (RBD). Here, we update the atlas of totally 77 mAbs against emerging sub-variants including BQ.1.1 and XBB and find that BA.4/5, BQ.1.1, and XBB display further evasion. Besides, investigation into the correlation of binding and neutralization of mAbs reveals the important role of antigenic conformation in mAb functioning. Moreover, the complex structures of BA.2 RBD/BD-604/S304 and BA.4/5 RBD/BD-604/S304/S309 further elucidate the molecular mechanism of antibody evasion by these sub-variants. By focusing on the identified broadly potent mAbs, we find a general hotspot epitope on the RBD, which could guide the design of vaccines and calls for new broad-spectrum countermeasures against COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
The excitatory glutamate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) contribute to epileptogenesis. Thirty patients with epilepsy and 31 healthy controls are scanned using positron emission tomography with our recently developed radiotracer for AMPARs, [11C]K-2, which measures the density of cell-surface AMPARs. In patients with focal-onset seizures, an increase in AMPAR trafficking augments the amplitude of abnormal gamma activity detected by electroencephalography. In contrast, patients with generalized-onset seizures exhibit a decrease in AMPARs coupled with increased amplitude of abnormal gamma activity. Patients with epilepsy had reduced AMPAR levels compared with healthy controls, and AMPARs are reduced in larger areas of the cortex in patients with generalized-onset seizures compared with those with focal-onset seizures. Thus, epileptic brain function can be regulated by the enhanced trafficking of AMPAR due to Hebbian plasticity with increased simultaneous neuronal firing and compensational downregulation of cell-surface AMPARs by the synaptic scaling.

Abstract: Summary
By restoring tryptophan, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitors aim to reactivate anti-tumor T cells. However, a phase III trial assessing their clinical benefit failed, prompting us to revisit the role of IDO1 in tumor cells under T cell attack. We show here that IDO1 inhibition leads to an adverse protection of melanoma cells to T cell-derived interferon-gamma (IFNγ). RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling shows that IFNγ shuts down general protein translation, which is reversed by IDO1 inhibition. Impaired translation is accompanied by an amino acid deprivation-dependent stress response driving activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4)high/microphtalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)low transcriptomic signatures, also in patient melanomas. Single-cell sequencing analysis reveals that MITF downregulation upon immune checkpoint blockade treatment predicts improved patient outcome. Conversely, MITF restoration in cultured melanoma cells causes T cell resistance. These results highlight the critical role of tryptophan and MITF in the melanoma response to T cell-derived IFNγ and uncover an unexpected negative consequence of IDO1 inhibition.

Abstract: Recently, Leydig cell (LCs) transplantation has a promising potential to treat male hypogonadism. However, the scarcity of seed cells is the actual barrier impeding the application of LCs transplantation. Utilizing the cutting-edge CRISPR/dCas9VP64 technology, human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were transdifferentiated into Leydig-like cells（iLCs） in previous study, but the efficiency of transdifferentiation is not very satisfactory. Therefore, this study was conducted to further optimize the CRISPR/dCas9 system for obtaining sufficient iLCs. First, the stable CYP11A1-Promoter-GFP-HFFs cell line was established by infecting HFFs with CYP11A1-Promoter-GFP lentiviral vectors, and then co-infected with dCas9p300 and the combination of sgRNAs targeted to NR5A1, GATA4 and DMRT1. Next, this study adopted quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot, and immunofluorescence to determine the efficiency of transdifferentiation, the generation of testosterone, the expression levels of steroidogenic biomarkers. Moreover, we utilized chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) to measure the levels of acetylation of targeted H3K27. The results revealed that advanced dCas9p300 facilitated generation of iLCs. Moreover, the dCas9p300-mediated iLCs significantly expressed the steroidogenic biomarkers and produced more testosterone with or without LH treatment than the dCas9VP64-mediated. Additionally, preferred enrichment in H3K27ac at the promoters was detected only with dCas9p300 treatment. The data provided here imply that the improved version of dCas9 can aid in the harvesting of iLCs, and will provide sufficient seed cells for cell transplantation treatment of androgen deficiency in the future.

Abstract: Summary
The peroxiredoxin (PRDX) family is a class of antioxidant enzymes with peroxidase activity. Human PRDXs currently have six members (PRDX1–6), which are gradually becoming potential therapeutic targets for major diseases such as cancer. In this study, we reported ainsliadimer A (AIN), a sesquiterpene lactone dimer with antitumor activity. We found that AIN directly targets Cys173 of PRDX1 and Cys172 of PRDX2 and then inhibits their peroxidase activities. As a result, the level of intracellular ROS increases, causing oxidative stress damage in mitochondria, inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, and significantly inhibiting ATP production. AIN inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, it inhibits tumor growth in mice and the growth of tumor organoid models. Therefore, AIN can be one of the natural compounds targeting PRDX1 and PRDX2 in the treatment of colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Perturbing expression is a powerful way to understand the role of individual genes, but can be challenging in important models. CRISPR-Cas screens in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are of limited efficiency due to DNA break-induced stress, while the less stressful silencing with an inactive Cas9 has been considered less effective so far. Here, we developed the dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 fusion protein for screening in iPSCs from multiple donors. We found silencing in a 200 bp window around the transcription start site in polyclonal pools to be as effective as using wild-type Cas9 for identifying essential genes, but with much reduced cell numbers. Whole-genome screens to identify ARID1A-dependent dosage sensitivity revealed the PSMB2 gene, and enrichment of proteasome genes among the hits. This selective dependency was replicated with a proteasome inhibitor, indicating a targetable drug-gene interaction. Many more plausible targets in challenging cell models can be efficiently identified with our approach.

Abstract: Summary
Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) can produce high-resolution tomograms of tissue vasculature with high accuracy. However, data processing and analysis is laborious due to the size of the datasets. Here, we introduce VesselExpress, an automated software that reliably analyzes six characteristic vascular network parameters including vessel diameter in LSFM data on average computing hardware. VesselExpress is ∼100 times faster than other existing vessel analysis tools, requires no user interaction, and integrates batch processing and parallelization. Employing an innovative dual Frangi filter approach, we show that obesity induces a large-scale modulation of brain vasculature in mice and that seven other major organs differ strongly in their 3D vascular makeup. Hence, VesselExpress transforms LSFM from an observational to an analytical working tool.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-12 (IL-12) gene transfer enhances the therapeutic potency of adoptive T cell therapies. We previously reported that transient engineering of tumor-specific CD8 T cells with IL-12 mRNA enhanced their systemic therapeutic efficacy when delivered intratumorally. Here, we mix T cells engineered with mRNAs to express either single-chain IL-12 (scIL-12) or an IL-18 decoy-resistant variant (DRIL18) that is not functionally hampered by IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP). These mRNA-engineered T cell mixtures are repeatedly injected into mouse tumors. Pmel-1 T cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic T cells electroporated with scIL-12 or DRIL18 mRNAs exert powerful therapeutic effects in local and distant melanoma lesions. These effects are associated with T cell metabolic fitness, enhanced miR-155 control on immunosuppressive target genes, enhanced expression of various cytokines, and changes in the glycosylation profile of surface proteins, enabling adhesiveness to E-selectin. Efficacy of this intratumoral immunotherapeutic strategy is recapitulated in cultures of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells on IL-12 and DRIL18 mRNA electroporation.

Abstract: Summary
Decreased left ventricle (LV) function caused by genetic mutations or injury often leads to debilitating and fatal cardiovascular disease. LV cardiomyocytes are, therefore, a potentially valuable therapeutical target. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) are neither homogeneous nor functionally mature, which reduces their utility. Here, we exploit cardiac development knowledge to instruct differentiation of hPSCs specifically toward LV cardiomyocytes. Correct mesoderm patterning and retinoic acid pathway blocking are essential to generate near-homogenous LV-specific hPSC-CMs (hPSC-LV-CMs). These cells transit via first heart field progenitors and display typical ventricular action potentials. Importantly, hPSC-LV-CMs exhibit increased metabolism, reduced proliferation, and improved cytoarchitecture and functional maturity compared with age-matched cardiomyocytes generated using the standard WNT-ON/WNT-OFF protocol. Similarly, engineered heart tissues made from hPSC-LV-CMs are better organized, produce higher force, and beat more slowly but can be paced to physiological levels. Together, we show that functionally matured hPSC-LV-CMs can be obtained rapidly without exposure to current maturation regimes.

Abstract: Summary
A genome-wide PiggyBac transposon-mediated screen and a resistance screen in a PIK3CAH1047R-mutated murine tumor model reveal NF1 loss in mammary tumors resistant to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase α (PI3Kα)-selective inhibitor alpelisib. Depletion of NF1 in PIK3CAH1047R breast cancer cell lines and a patient-derived organoid model shows that NF1 loss reduces sensitivity to PI3Kα inhibition and correlates with enhanced glycolysis and lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Unexpectedly, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) sensitizes NF1 knockout cells to PI3Kα inhibition and reverts their glycolytic phenotype. Global phospho-proteomics indicates that combination with NAC enhances the inhibitory effect of alpelisib on mTOR signaling. In public datasets of human breast cancer, we find that NF1 is frequently mutated and that such mutations are enriched in metastases, an indication for which use of PI3Kα inhibitors has been approved. Our results raise the attractive possibility of combining PI3Kα inhibition with NAC supplementation, especially in patients with drug-resistant metastases associated with NF1 loss.

Abstract: Syk is a tumor suppressor gene in some solid tumors. Currently, it remains unknown how Syk gene hypermethylation is controlled by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and p53. In colorectal cancer HCT116 cells, we found that protein and mRNA levels of Syk were much higher in WT than in p53−/− cells. Both p53 inhibitor PFT-α and p53 silencing can reduce the protein and mRNA expression of Syk in WT cells, while DNMT inhibitor 5-Aza-2′-dC can increase Syk expression in p53−/− cells. Interestingly, the DNMT expression in p53−/− HCT116 cells was higher than that in WT cells. PFT-α can not only enhance Syk gene methylation but also increase DNMT1 protein and mRNA levels in WT HCT116 cells. In metastatic lung cancer cell lines A549 and PC9, which express WT p53 and gain function of p53, respectively, PFT-α can also downregulate Syk mRNA and protein expression. However, the Syk methylation level was increased by PFT-α in A549 but not in PC9 cells. Likewise, 5-Aza-2′-dC transcriptionally increased Syk gene expression in A549 cells, but not in PC9 cells. In summary methylation of Syk promoter requires DNMT1, and p53 can upregulate Syk expression via downregulation of DNMT1 at the transcriptional level.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignancy tumor worldwide with high incidence and mortality. Accumulating evidence indicated that through an m6A-dependent or m6A-independent mechanism, fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) exhibits the tumor-promoting and suppressive roles of FTO involved in various cancers, including cervical cancer. This study aims to verify the biological function and potential mechanisms of FTO in cervical cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo. Herein, we confirmed that knockdown of FTO inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells in vitro via cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay, colony formation assay, and transwell migration and invasion assay. The demethylase activity of FTO is required for cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells in vitro. RNA sequencing, online database analysis, and western blotting revealed that FTO regulated the BMP4/Hippo/YAP1/TAZ pathway. In addition, FTO upregulates the expression of BMP4 in an m6A-dependent manner and binds to the N-terminal of BMP4 to form a dimer at the C-terminal in cervical cancer cells through protein-protein interaction. We further discovered that BMP4 treatment promoted cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells, and rescue experiments validated that BMP4 treatment reversed the inhibition of FTO knockdown on the Hippo/YAP1/TAZ pathway and the progression of cervical cancer cells in vitro. Notably, the knockdown of FTO significantly suppressed xenograft tumor growth and the protein level of BMP4 in vivo. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the FTO promotes cervical cancer progression in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of the BMP4/Hippo/YAP1/TAZ pathway, suggesting that FTO acts as an oncogenic molecule and the FTO/BMP4 Hippo/YAP1/TAZ axis may serve as valuable targets for cervical cancer treatment.

USP2a can deubiquitinate and stabilize Mdm2, whether USP2a can regulate Mdm2-p60 needs to be further confirmed and elucidated. We found that oxidative stress can up-regulate USP2a at the post-transcriptional level and induce USP2a to be oxidized by forming inter-subunit disulfide bonds. The oxidized USP2a is closely related with cell apoptosis. In apoptotic cells, oxidized USP2a has enhanced protein stability and further stabilizes Mdm2-p60 through deubiquitination, and the USP2a-Mdm2-p60-p53 axis plays a role in cell apoptosis. Altogether USP2a is oxygen sensitive, oxidized USP2a exerts apoptotic effects through the Mdm2-p60-p53 axis, which provides an experimental basis for regulating p53 apoptotic signaling by targeting USP2a.

Abstract: Summary
Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of diarrheal disease in children and an important contributor to early childhood mortality. The parasite invades and extensively remodels intestinal epithelial cells, building an elaborate interface structure. How this occurs at the molecular level and the contributing parasite factors are largely unknown. Here, we generated a whole-cell spatial proteome of the Cryptosporidium sporozoite and used genetic and cell biological experimentation to discover the Cryptosporidium-secreted effector proteome. These findings reveal multiple organelles, including an original secretory organelle, and generate numerous compartment markers by tagging native gene loci. We show that secreted proteins are delivered to the parasite-host interface, where they assemble into different structures including a ring that anchors the parasite into its unique epicellular niche. Cryptosporidium thus uses a complex set of secretion systems during and following invasion that act in concert to subjugate its host cell.

Abstract: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) produce extracellular matrixes (ECMs), such as collagen and fibronectin, in response to stimulation with transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). The massive ECM accumulation in the liver due to HSCs causes fibrosis which eventually leads to hepatic cirrhosis and hepatoma development. However, details of the mechanisms underlying continuous HSC activation are as yet poorly understood. We thus attempted to elucidate the role of Pin1, one of the prolyl isomerases, in the underlying mechanism(s), using the human HSC line LX-2. Treatment with Pin1 siRNAs markedly alleviated the TGFβ-induced expressions of ECM components such as collagen 1a1/2, smooth muscle actin and fibronectin at both the mRNA and the protein level. Pin1 inhibitors also decreased the expressions of fibrotic markers. In addition, it was revealed that Pin1 associates with Smad2/3/4, and that four Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in the linker domain of Smad3 are essential for binding with Pin1. Pin1 significantly regulated Smad-binding element transcriptional activity without affecting Smad3 phosphorylations or translocation. Importantly, both Yes-associated protein (YAP) and WW domain-containing transcription regulator (TAZ) also participate in ECM induction, and upregulate Smad3 activity rather than TEA domain transcriptional factor transcriptional activity. Although Smad3 interacts with both TAZ and YAP, Pin1 facilitates the Smad3 association with TAZ, but not that with YAP. In conclusion, Pin1 plays pivotal roles in ECM component productions in HSCs through regulation of the interaction between TAZ and Smad3, and Pin1 inhibitors may have the potential to ameliorate fibrotic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-associated (Cas) nucleases are multifunctional tools for gene editing. Cas12a possesses several advantages, including the requirement of a single guide RNA and high fidelity of gene editing. Here, we tested three Cas12a orthologs from human gut samples and identified a LtCas12a that utilizes a TTNA protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) distinct from the canonical TTTV PAM but with equivalent cleavage ability and specificity. These features significantly broadened the targeting scope of Cas12a family. Furthermore, we developed a sensitive, accurate, and rapid human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 gene detection platform based on LtCas12a DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR) and lateral flow assay (LFA). LtCas12a showed comparable sensitivity to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and no cross-reaction with 13 other high-risk HPV genotypes in detecting the HPV16/18 L1 gene. Taken together, LtCas12a can broaden the applications of the CRISPR-Cas12a family and serve as a promising next-generation tool for therapeutic application and molecular diagnosis.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer (OC) is a common malignant tumor in gynecology. LMNB1 is an important component of the nuclear skeleton. The expression of LMNB1 in ovarian cancer is significantly higher than that in normal tissues, but its role in tumor still needs comprehensive investigation. In this study, we overexpressed and knocked down LMNB1 in ovarian cancer cells and explore the effect of LMNB1 on the cell proliferation, migration and the underlying mechanism. We analyzed the expression levels of LMNB1 in ovarian cancer and their clinical relevance by using bioinformatics methods, qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. To state the effect and mechanism of LMNB1 on OC in vitro and in vivo, we performed mouse xenograft studies, CCK8, cloning formation, Edu incorporation, wound healing, transwell and flow cytometry assay in stable LMNB1 knockdown OC cells, following by RNA-seq. Overexpression of LMNB1 indicates the progression of OC. LMNB1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and migration of OC cells by suppressing the FGF1-mediated PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Our study shows LMNB1 as a novel prognostic factor and therapeutic target in OC.

Abstract: Summary
Gastrointestinal infection changes microbiome composition and gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that enteric infection also promotes rapid genetic adaptation in a gut commensal. Measurements of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron population dynamics within gnotobiotic mice reveal that these populations are relatively stable in the absence of infection, and the introduction of the enteropathogen Citrobacter rodentium reproducibly promotes rapid selection for a single-nucleotide variant with increased fitness. This mutation promotes resistance to oxidative stress by altering the sequence of a protein, IctA, that is essential for fitness during infection. We identified commensals from multiple phyla that attenuate the selection of this variant during infection. These species increase the levels of vitamin B6 in the gut lumen. Direct administration of this vitamin is sufficient to significantly reduce variant expansion in infected mice. Our work demonstrates that a self-limited enteric infection can leave a stable mark on resident commensal populations that increase fitness during infection.

Abstract: Summary
There is strong selection for the evolution of systems that protect bacterial populations from viral attack. We report a single phage defense protein, Hna, that provides protection against diverse phages in Sinorhizobium meliloti, a nitrogen-fixing alpha-proteobacterium. Homologs of Hna are distributed widely across bacterial lineages, and a homologous protein from Escherichia coli also confers phage defense. Hna contains superfamily II helicase motifs at its N terminus and a nuclease motif at its C terminus, with mutagenesis of these motifs inactivating viral defense. Hna variably impacts phage DNA replication but consistently triggers an abortive infection response in which infected cells carrying the system die but do not release phage progeny. A similar host cell response is triggered in cells containing Hna upon expression of a phage-encoded single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB), independent of phage infection. Thus, we conclude that Hna limits phage spread by initiating abortive infection in response to a phage protein.

Abstract: Summary
Artemisinins (ART) are critical anti-malarials and despite their use in combination therapy, ART-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is spreading globally. To counter ART resistance, we designed artezomibs (ATZs), molecules that link an ART with a proteasome inhibitor (PI) via a non-labile amide bond and hijack parasite’s own ubiquitin-proteasome system to create novel anti-malarials in situ. Upon activation of the ART moiety, ATZs covalently attach to and damage multiple parasite proteins, marking them for proteasomal degradation. When damaged proteins enter the proteasome, their attached PIs inhibit protease function, potentiating the parasiticidal action of ART and overcoming ART resistance. Binding of the PI moiety to the proteasome active site is enhanced by distal interactions of the extended attached peptides, providing a mechanism to overcome PI resistance. ATZs have an extra mode of action beyond that of each component, thereby overcoming resistance to both components, while avoiding transient monotherapy seen when individual agents have disparate pharmacokinetic profiles.

Abstract: Summary
The transgenerational maternal effects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in female progeny are being revealed. As there is evidence that a male equivalent of PCOS may exists, we ask whether sons born to mothers with PCOS (PCOS-sons) transmit reproductive and metabolic phenotypes to their male progeny. Here, in a register-based cohort and a clinical case-control study, we find that PCOS-sons are more often obese and dyslipidemic. Our prenatal androgenized PCOS-like mouse model with or without diet-induced obesity confirmed that reproductive and metabolic dysfunctions in first-generation (F1) male offspring are passed down to F3. Sequencing of F1–F3 sperm reveals distinct differentially expressed (DE) small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) across generations in each lineage. Notably, common targets between transgenerational DEsncRNAs in mouse sperm and in PCOS-sons serum indicate similar effects of maternal hyperandrogenism, strengthening the translational relevance and highlighting a previously underappreciated risk of transmission of reproductive and metabolic dysfunction via the male germline.

Abstract: Summary
Organoid models provide powerful tools to study tissue biology and development in a dish. Presently, organoids have not yet been developed from mouse tooth. Here, we established tooth organoids (TOs) from early-postnatal mouse molar and incisor, which are long-term expandable, express dental epithelium stem cell (DESC) markers, and recapitulate key properties of the dental epithelium in a tooth-type-specific manner. TOs display in vitro differentiation capacity toward ameloblast-resembling cells, even more pronounced in assembloids in which dental mesenchymal (pulp) stem cells are combined with the organoid DESCs. Single-cell transcriptomics supports this developmental potential and reveals co-differentiation into junctional epithelium- and odontoblast-/cementoblast-like cells in the assembloids. Finally, TOs survive and show ameloblast-resembling differentiation also in vivo. The developed organoid models provide new tools to study mouse tooth-type-specific biology and development and gain deeper molecular and functional insights that may eventually help to achieve future human biological tooth repair and replacement.

Abstract: In recent years, we have realized that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a critical role in regulating the intercellular communication between tumor and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TDEVs) profoundly affect the functional changes of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and promote their M2 polarization. Meanwhile, macrophages have a strong phagocytic ability in phagocytosing apoptotic cells. Especially in the course of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, TAMs can phagocytose and remove apoptotic tumor cells, showing anti-inflammatory and pro-tumor effects. However, the underlying mechanisms by which TDEVs regulate macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we focused on the effect of colorectal cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (CRC-EVs) on macrophages. We demonstrated that CRC-EVs enhanced macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic CRC cells. We then determined that heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) carried in CRC-EVs was responsible for this effect by using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis and the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Through transcriptome sequencing of macrophages, we found that the enhanced phagocytosis of macrophages was mainly due to the up-regulation of the macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO). In addition, we confirmed that the up-regulation of MARCO was mediated by the AKT-STAT3 signaling pathway. Taken together, this study revealed a novel EVs-mediated macrophage phagocytosis mechanism involved in the clearance of apoptotic tumor cells in the TME. Targeting TDEVs may have potential therapeutic applications in tumor treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The origin, composition, and significance of the distal male urethral microbiome are unclear, but vaginal microbiome dysbiosis is linked to new sex partners and several urogynecological syndromes. We characterized 110 urethral specimens from men without urethral symptoms, infections, or inflammation using shotgun metagenomics. Most urethral specimens contain characteristic lactic acid bacteria and Corynebacterium spp. In contrast, several bacteria associated with vaginal dysbiosis were present only in specimens from men who reported vaginal intercourse. Sexual behavior, but not other evaluated behavioral, demographic, or clinical variables, strongly associated with inter-specimen variance in urethral microbiome composition. Thus, the male urethra supports a simple core microbiome that is established independent of sexual exposures but can be re-shaped by vaginal sex. Overall, the results suggest that urogenital microbiology and sexual behavior are inexorably intertwined, and show that the male urethra harbors female urogenital pathobionts.

Abstract: Summary
Organoid technologies are rapidly advancing and hold great potential and hope for disease modeling and clinical translational research. Still, they raise a number of complex, ethical questions regarding their current and future use. Patient and public involvement is important in building public trust and helping to secure responsible conduct and valued innovations; nevertheless, research into patient and public perspectives on organoid technologies remains scarce. We report on a first public dialogue on organoid technologies through three cross-country deliberative workshops with a diverse group of stakeholders to identify their perceptions and concerns. Participants generally support organoid technologies on the condition that responsible governance, ethical oversight, and sound informed consent procedures are in place. Yet, a broad set of potential concerns are identified, primarily concerning commercialization, healthcare access, and cerebral organoids. Participants’ insights and recommendations can help inform researchers and ethics and policy bodies toward supporting responsible and ethical organoid approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Unintegrated HIV DNA represents between 20% and 35% of the total viral DNA in infected patients. Only the linear forms (unintegrated linear DNAs [ULDs]) can be substrates for integration and for the completion of a full viral cycle. In quiescent cells, these ULDs may be responsible for pre-integrative latency. However, their detection remains difficult due to the lack of specificity and sensitivity of existing techniques. We developed an ultra-sensitive, specific, and high-throughput technology for ULD quantification called DUSQ (DNA ultra-sensitive quantification) combining linker-mediated PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS) using molecular barcodes. Studying cells with different activity levels, we determined that the ULD half-life goes up to 11 days in resting CD4+ T cells. Finally, we were able to quantify ULDs in samples from patients infected with HIV-1, providing a proof of concept for the use of DUSQ in vivo to track pre-integrative latency. DUSQ can be adapted to the detection of other rare DNA molecules.

Abstract: Summary
The transplanting islets to the liver approach suffers from an immediate posttransplant loss of islets of more than 50%, progressive graft dysfunction over time, and precludes recovery of grafts should there be serious complications such as the development of teratomas with grafts that are stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets). The omentum features an attractive extrahepatic alternative site for clinical islet transplantation. We explore an approach in which allogeneic islets are transplanted onto the omentum, which is bioengineered with a plasma-thrombin biodegradable matrix in three diabetic non-human primates (NHPs). Within 1 week posttransplant, each transplanted NHP achieves normoglycemia and insulin independence and remains stable until termination of the experiment. Success was achieved in each case with islets recovered from a single NHP donor. Histology demonstrates robust revascularization and reinnervation of the graft. This preclinical study can inform the development of strategies for β cell replacement including the use of SC-islets or other types of novel cells in clinical settings.

Abstract: Summary
Cell replacement therapy is expected as a new and more radical treatment against brain damage. We previously reported that transplanted human cerebral organoids extend their axons along the corticospinal tract in rodent brains. The axons reached the spinal cord but were still sparse. Therefore, this study optimized the host brain environment by the adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of axon guidance proteins in mouse brain. Among netrin-1, SEMA3, and L1CAM, only L1CAM significantly promoted the axonal extension of mouse embryonic brain tissue-derived grafts. L1CAM was also expressed by donor neurons, and this promotion was exerted in a haptotactic manner by their homophilic binding. Primary cortical neurons cocultured on L1CAM-expressing HEK-293 cells supported this mechanism. These results suggest that optimizing the host environment by the AAV-mediated expression of axon guidance molecules enhances the effect of cell replacement therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines demonstrate reduced protection against acquisition of BA.5 subvariant but are still effective against severe disease. However, immune correlates of protection against BA.5 remain unknown. We report the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of vaccine regimens consisting of the vector-based Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and the adjuvanted spike ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) vaccine against a high-dose, mismatched Omicron BA.5 challenge in macaques. The SpFNx3 and Ad26 + SpFNx2 regimens elicit higher antibody responses than Ad26x3, whereas the Ad26 + SpFNx2 and Ad26x3 regimens induce higher CD8 T cell responses than SpFNx3. The Ad26 + SpFNx2 regimen elicits the highest CD4 T cell responses. All three regimens suppress peak and day 4 viral loads in the respiratory tract, which correlate with both humoral and cellular immune responses. This study demonstrates that both homologous and heterologous regimens involving Ad26.COV2.S and SpFN vaccines provide robust protection against a mismatched BA.5 challenge in macaques.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the adaptive mechanisms that prevent host immune response in cancer will help predict efficacy of anti-programmed death-1 (PD1)/L1 therapies. Here, we study the cell-intrinsic response of lung cancer (LC) to interferon-γ (IFNγ), a cytokine that promotes immunoresponse and modulates programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) levels. We report complete refractoriness to IFNγ in a subset of LCs as a result of JAK2 or IFNGR1 inactivation. A submaximal response affects another subset that shows constitutive low levels of IFNγ-stimulated genes (IγSGs) coupled with decreased H3K27ac (histone 3 acetylation at lysine 27) deposition and promoter hypermethylation and reduced IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) recruitment to the DNA on IFNγ stimulation. Most of these are neuroendocrine small cell LCs (SCLCs) with oncogenic MYC/MYCL1/MYCN. The oncogenic activation of MYC in SCLC cells downregulates JAK2 and impairs IγSGs stimulation by IFNγ. MYC amplification tends to associate with a worse response to anti-PD1/L1 therapies. Hence alterations affecting the JAK/STAT pathway and MYC activation prevent stimulation by IFNγ and may predict anti-PD1/L1 efficacy in LC.

Abstract: Summary
G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-biased agonism, selective activation of certain signaling pathways relative to others, is thought to be directed by differential GPCR phosphorylation “barcodes.” At chemokine receptors, endogenous chemokines can act as “biased agonists”, which may contribute to the limited success when pharmacologically targeting these receptors. Here, mass spectrometry-based global phosphoproteomics revealed that CXCR3 chemokines generate different phosphorylation barcodes associated with differential transducer activation. Chemokine stimulation resulted in distinct changes throughout the kinome in global phosphoproteomics studies. Mutation of CXCR3 phosphosites altered β-arrestin 2 conformation in cellular assays and was consistent with conformational changes observed in molecular dynamics simulations. T cells expressing phosphorylation-deficient CXCR3 mutants resulted in agonist- and receptor-specific chemotactic profiles. Our results demonstrate that CXCR3 chemokines are non-redundant and act as biased agonists through differential encoding of phosphorylation barcodes, leading to distinct physiological processes.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial fission is critical for mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis. The dynamin superfamily GTPase DRP1 is recruited by three functionally redundant receptors, MFF, MiD49, and MiD51, to mitochondria to drive fission. Here, we exploit high-content live-cell imaging to screen for mitochondrial fission inhibitors and have developed a covalent compound, mitochondrial division inhibitor (MIDI). MIDI treatment potently blocks mitochondrial fragmentation induced by mitochondrial toxins and restores mitochondrial morphology in fusion-defective cells carrying pathogenic mitofusin and OPA1 mutations. Mechanistically, MIDI does not affect DRP1 tetramerization nor DRP1 GTPase activity but does block DRP1 recruitment to mitochondria. Subsequent biochemical and cellular characterizations reveal an unexpected mechanism that MIDI targets DRP1 interaction with multiple receptors via covalent interaction with DRP1-C367. Taken together, beyond developing a potent mitochondrial fission inhibitor that profoundly impacts mitochondrial morphogenesis, our study establishes proof of concept for developing protein-protein interaction inhibitors targeting DRP1.

Abstract: Summary
The Plasmodium falciparum proteasome constitutes a promising antimalarial target, with multiple chemotypes potently and selectively inhibiting parasite proliferation and synergizing with the first-line artemisinin drugs, including against artemisinin-resistant parasites. We compared resistance profiles of vinyl sulfone, epoxyketone, macrocyclic peptide, and asparagine ethylenediamine inhibitors and report that the vinyl sulfones were potent even against mutant parasites resistant to other proteasome inhibitors and did not readily select for resistance, particularly WLL that displays covalent and irreversible binding to the catalytic β2 and β5 proteasome subunits. We also observed instances of collateral hypersensitivity, whereby resistance to one inhibitor could sensitize parasites to distinct chemotypes. Proteasome selectivity was confirmed using CRISPR/Cas9-edited mutant and conditional knockdown parasites. Molecular modeling of proteasome mutations suggested spatial contraction of the β5 P1 binding pocket, compromising compound binding. Dual targeting of P. falciparum proteasome subunits using covalent inhibitors provides a potential strategy for restoring artemisinin activity and combating the spread of drug-resistant malaria.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are superior to differentiated cells to maintain genome stability, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. R-loops are constantly formed during transcription and are inducers of DNA damage if not resolved. Here we report that mouse ESCs (mESCs) can efficiently prevent unscheduled R-loop formation, and a long noncoding RNA Lnc530 plays regulatory role. Lnc530 is expressed in mESCs and localizes on R-loops. Depletion of Lnc530 in mESCs causes R-loop accumulation and DNA damage, whereas forced expression of Lnc530 in differentiated cells suppresses the R-loop formation. Mechanistically, Lnc530 associates with DDX5 and TDP-43 in an inter-dependent manner on R-loops. Formation of Lnc530-DDX5-TDP-43 complex substantially increases the local protein levels of DDX5 and TDP-43, both of which play critical roles in R-loop regulation. This study uncovers an efficient strategy to prevent R-loop accumulation and preserve genomic stability in mESCs and possibly other stem cell types.

Abstract: Background
Low pleckstrin homology-like domain family A, member 3 (PHLDA3) expression has been reported to be associated with cancer specificity and disease-free survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and was an independent predictor of postoperative recurrence. However, the specific mechanisms involved are still unclear. This paper aimed to explore the role and its mechanisms of PHLDA3 in ESCC.
Materials and methods
PHLDA3 and BarH-like homeobox 2 (BARX2) expressions in ESCC were predicted by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) analysis and determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western Blot. Western blot detected the expression of proteins associated with migration, angiogenesis and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) signaling pathway. The University of California Santa Cruz Genomics Institute (UCSC) database predicted that the relationship of BARX2 and PHLDA3 promoter and JASPAR identified the possible binding sites. Dual luciferase gene reporter verified PHLDA3 promoter activity, and the relationship of both was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP). Cell counting kit (CCK)-8, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EDU) and colony formation were used to assess cell proliferation. Wound healing and transwell were used to detect cell migration and invasion ability. Tube formation assay was applied to assess angiogenesis. Mice were injected with transfected KYSE30 cells under the right axilla. Body weight and tumor volume and mass were recorded for each group of mice. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect KI67 level in tumor tissues.
Results
Both PHLDA3 and BARX2 were downregulated in ESCC. The upregulated PHLDA3 suppressed PI3K/AKT expression. In addition, BARX2 bound to the PHLDA3 promoter and transcriptionally activated PHLDA3. PHLDA3 overexpression inhibited ESCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis, but this effect was reversed by BARX2 knockdown. In addition, BARX2 overexpression inhibited ESCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis, but this effect was reversed by PHLDA3 knockdown.
Conclusion
PHLDA3 was transcriptionally activated by BARX2 and inhibited malignant progression of ESCC by downregulating PI3K/AKT levels.

Abstract: Liver fibrosis is a wound-healing response that arises from various aetiologies. Flavonoid compounds have been proved of their anti-liver fibrosis effects. This study aimed to elucidate the protective effect and mechanism of flavonoid compound GL-V9 on CCl4-induced and DDC-induced liver fibrosis. Treatment with GL-V9 alleviated hepatic injury and exhibited a dramatic protection effect of liver fibrosis. Further experiments found that GL-V9 treatment inhibited extracellular matrix (ECM) expression. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a central driver of fibrosis. GL-V9 could inhibit the activation of HSCs through directly binding to TGFβRI, subsequently inhibit TGF-β/Smad pathway. In conclusion, this study proved that GL-V9 executed a protective effect on liver fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-β/Smad pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited progressive disease characterized by electrophysiological and structural remodeling of the ventricles. However, the disease-causing molecular pathways, as a consequence of desmosomal mutations, are poorly understood. Here, we identified a novel missense mutation within desmoplakin in a patient clinically diagnosed with ACM. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we corrected this mutation in patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and generated an independent knockin hiPSC line carrying the same mutation. Mutant cardiomyocytes displayed a decline in connexin 43, NaV1.5, and desmosomal proteins, which was accompanied by a prolonged action potential duration. Interestingly, paired-like homeodomain 2 (PITX2), a transcription factor that acts a repressor of connexin 43, NaV1.5, and desmoplakin, was induced in mutant cardiomyocytes. We validated these results in control cardiomyocytes in which PITX2 was either depleted or overexpressed. Importantly, knockdown of PITX2 in patient-derived cardiomyocytes is sufficient to restore the levels of desmoplakin, connexin 43, and NaV1.5.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) participate in the occurrence and development of lung cancer. MiR-151a-5p has been reported to be highly expressed in the tumor tissues of lung cancer. The aim of this work was to investigate whether EVs can affect lung cancer progression by delivering miR-151a-5p. In this work, we found that miR-151a-5p was highly expressed in serum of lung cancer patients. Up-regulation of miR-151a-5p and down-regulation of Nedd4-binding partner-1 (N4BP1) were observed in lung cancer cell lines. The expression of miR-151a-5p was also increased in H520-derived EVs. H520-derived EVs promoted cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis of H520 cells by delivering miR-151a-5p. EVs containing miR-151a-5p repressed E-cadherin expression and elevated N-cadherin and Vimentin expression to impede epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of H520 cells. Additionally, the interaction between miR-151a-5p and N4BP1 was verified by luciferase reporter assay, showing that miR-151a-5p interacted with N4BP1. MiR-151a-5p repressed N4BP1 expression by interacting with N4BP1. EVs containing miR-151a-5p promoted malignant phenotypes of H520 cells by targeting N4BP1. Finally, a tumor-bearing mouse model was constructed by inoculation of H520 cells with miR-151a-5p overexpression or knockdown. Overexpression of miR-151a-5p accelerated tumor growth of lung cancer in vivo, and repressed N4BP1 expression in the tumor tissues. Knockdown of miR-151a-5p caused opposite results. In conclusion, this work demonstrated that lung cancer cell-derived EVs secreted miR-151a-5p to promote cell proliferation, and inhibit apoptosis and EMT of lung cancer cells by targeting N4BP1, thereby accelerating lung cancer progression. Thus, this study suggests that EVs-derived miR-151a-5p may be a potential target for lung cancer treatment.

Silencing EIF3A ameliorates pulmonary arterial hypertension through HDAC1 and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway in vitro and in vivo,

Abstract: Pulmonary vascular remodeling caused by the excessive proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) is the hallmark feature of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit A (EIF3A) exhibited proliferative activity in multiple cell types. The present study investigated the role of EIF3A in the progression of PAH. A monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH rat model was constructed, and adeno-associated virus type 1 (AAV1) carrying EIF3A shRNA was intratracheally delivered to PAH rats to block EIF3A expression. PASMCs were isolated from rats and treated with PDGF-BB to simulate PASMC proliferation, and shRNA for EIF3 was conducted to investigate the mechanism behind the role of EIF3A in PASMC function in vitro. EIF3A expression was upregulated in pulmonary arteries, and EIF3A inhibition effectively improved pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy and suppressed MCT-induced vascular remodeling in vivo. In addition, we found that genetic knockdown of EIF3A reduced PDGF-triggered proliferation and arrested cell cycle, accompanied by downregulated proliferation-related protein expression in PASMCs. Mechanistically, the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)-mediated PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway was recognized as a primary mechanism in PAH progression. Silencing EIF3A decreased HDAC1 expression, and further inhibited the excessive proliferation of PASMCs by increasing the phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) expression and suppressing the AKT phosphorylation. Notably, HDAC1 expression reversed the effect of silencing EIF3A on PAH and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. Collectively, silencing EIF3A improved PAH by decreasing PASMC proliferation through the HDAC1-mediated PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. These findings suggest that targeting EIF3A may represent a potential approach for the treatment of PAH.

Abstract: Summary
Ischemic heart failure is due to irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes. Preclinical studies showed that human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes could remuscularize infarcted hearts and improve cardiac function. However, these cardiomyocytes remained immature. Incorporating hPSC-derived epicardial cells has been shown to improve cardiomyocyte maturation, but the exact mechanisms are unknown. We posited epicardial fibronectin (FN1) as a mediator of epicardial-cardiomyocyte crosstalk and assessed its role in driving hPSC-derived cardiomyocyte maturation in 3D-engineered heart tissues (3D-EHTs). We found that the loss of FN1 with peptide inhibition F(pUR4), CRISPR-Cas9-mediated FN1 knockout, or tetracycline-inducible FN1 knockdown in 3D-EHTs resulted in immature cardiomyocytes with decreased contractile function, and inefficient Ca2+ handling. Conversely, when we supplemented 3D-EHTs with recombinant human FN1, we could recover hPSC-derived cardiomyocyte maturation. Finally, our RNA-sequencing analyses found FN1 within a wider paracrine network of epicardial-cardiomyocyte crosstalk, thus solidifying FN1 as a key driver of hPSC-derived cardiomyocyte maturation in 3D-EHTs.

Abstract: Summary
The therapeutic potential of ligands targeting disease-associated membrane proteins is predicted by ligand-receptor binding constants, which can be determined using NanoLuciferase (NanoLuc)-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) methods. However, the broad applicability of these methods is hampered by the restricted availability of fluorescent probes. We describe the use of antibody fragments, like nanobodies, as universal building blocks for fluorescent probes for use in NanoBRET. Our nanobody-NanoBRET (NanoB2) workflow starts with the generation of NanoLuc-tagged receptors and fluorescent nanobodies, enabling homogeneous, real-time monitoring of nanobody-receptor binding. Moreover, NanoB2 facilitates the assessment of receptor binding of unlabeled ligands in competition binding experiments. The broad significance is illustrated by the successful application of NanoB2 to different drug targets (e.g., multiple G protein-coupled receptors [GPCRs] and a receptor tyrosine kinase [RTK]) at distinct therapeutically relevant binding sites (i.e., extracellular and intracellular).

Abstract: Summary
Somatic mutations occur as random genetic changes in genes through protein-affecting mutations (PAMs), gene fusions, or copy number alterations (CNAs). Mutations of different types can have a similar phenotypic effect (i.e., allelic heterogeneity) and should be integrated into a unified gene mutation profile. We developed OncoMerge to fill this niche of integrating somatic mutations to capture allelic heterogeneity, assign a function to mutations, and overcome known obstacles in cancer genetics. Application of OncoMerge to TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas increased detection of somatically mutated genes and improved the prediction of the somatic mutation role as either activating or loss of function. Using integrated somatic mutation matrices increased the power to infer gene regulatory networks and uncovered the enrichment of switch-like feedback motifs and delay-inducing feedforward loops. These studies demonstrate that OncoMerge efficiently integrates PAMs, fusions, and CNAs and strengthens downstream analyses linking somatic mutations to cancer phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
There are significant differences in the susceptibility of populations to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that mice exhibit significant differences in susceptibility to I/R-induced enterogenic sepsis. Notably, the milnacipran (MC) content in the enterogenic-sepsis-tolerant mice is significantly higher. We also reveal that the pre-operative fecal MC content in cardiopulmonary bypass patients, including those with intestinal I/R injury, is associated with susceptibility to post-operative gastrointestinal injury. We reveal that MC attenuates mouse I/R injury in wild-type mice but not in intestinal epithelial aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene conditional knockout mice (AHRflox/flox) or IL-22 gene deletion mice (IL-22−/−). Collectively, our results suggest that gut microbiota affects susceptibility to I/R-induced enterogenic sepsis and that gut microbiota-derived MC plays a pivotal role in tolerance to intestinal I/R in an AHR/ILC3/IL-22 signaling-dependent manner, revealing the pathological mechanism, potential prevention and treatment drugs, and treatment strategies for intestinal I/R.

Abstract: Warburg effect is associated with the progression of various tumors, leading to the development of drugs targeting the phenomenon. PFKFB3 is an isoform of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK2) that modulates the Warburg effect and has been implicated in most common types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the mechanisms underlying the upstream regulation of PFKFB3 in NSCLC remain poorly understood. This study reported that the transcription factor HOXD9 is upregulated in NSCLC patient samples relative to adjacent normal tissue. Elevated HOXD9 levels are primarily associated with poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. Functionally, HOXD9 knockdown impaired the metastatic capacity of NSCLC cells, whereas its over-expression accelerated the metastasis and invasion of NSCLC cells in an orthotopic tumor mouse model. In addition, HOXD9 promoted metastasis by increasing cellular glycolysis. Further mechanistic studies revealed that HOXD9 directly binds to the promoter region of PFKFB3 to enhance its transcription. The recovery assay confirmed that the capability of HOXD9 to promote NSCLC cells metastasis was significantly weakened upon PFKFB3 inhibition. These data suggest that HOXD9 may exert as a novel biomarker in NSCLC, indicating that blocking the HOXD9/PFKFB3 axis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for NSCLC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of renal failure. Therapeutics development is hampered by our incomplete understanding of animal models on a cellular level. We show that ZSF1 rats recapitulate human DKD on a phenotypic and transcriptomic level. Tensor decomposition prioritizes proximal tubule (PT) and stroma as phenotype-relevant cell types exhibiting a continuous lineage relationship. As DKD features endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and nitric oxide depletion, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is a promising DKD drug target. sGC expression is specifically enriched in PT and stroma. In ZSF1 rats, pharmacological sGC activation confers considerable benefits over stimulation and is mechanistically related to improved oxidative stress regulation, resulting in enhanced downstream cGMP effects. Finally, we define sGC gene co-expression modules, which allow stratification of human kidney samples by DKD prevalence and disease-relevant measures such as kidney function, proteinuria, and fibrosis, underscoring the relevance of the sGC pathway to patients.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. However, the effect of tissue-resident commensal bacteria on CRC immune surveillance remains poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the intratissue bacteria from CRC patient colon tissues. We found that the commensal bacteria belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family, including Ruminococcus gnavus (Rg), Blautia producta (Bp), and Dorea formicigenerans (Df), were enriched in normal tissues, while Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (Pa) were abundant in tumor tissues. Tissue-resident Rg and Bp reduced colon tumor growth and promoted the activation of CD8+ T cells in immunocompetent mice. Mechanistically, intratissue Rg and Bp degraded lyso-glycerophospholipids that inhibited CD8+ T cell activity and maintained the immune surveillance function of CD8+ T cells. Lyso-glycerophospholipids alone promoted tumor growth that was abrogated with Rg and Bp injection. Collectively, intratissue Lachnospiraceae family bacteria facilitate the immune surveillance function of CD8+ T cells and control colorectal cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we present simultaneous fiber photometry recordings and optogenetic stimulation based on a multimode fused fiber coupler for both light delivery and collection without the need for dichroic beam splitters. In combination with a multi-color light source and appropriate optical filters, our approach offers remarkable flexibility in experimental design and facilitates the exploration of new molecular tools in vivo at minimal cost. We demonstrate straightforward re-configuration of the setup to operate with green, red, and near-infrared calcium indicators with or without simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and further explore the multi-color photometry capabilities of the system. The ease of assembly, operation, characterization, and customization of this platform holds the potential to foster the development of experimental strategies for multi-color fused fiber photometry combined with optogenetics far beyond its current state.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common chronic liver disease globally and a leading cause for liver transplantation in the US. Its pathogenesis remains imprecisely defined. We combined two high-resolution modalities to tissue samples from NASH clinical trials, machine learning (ML)-based quantification of histological features and transcriptomics, to identify genes that are associated with disease progression and clinical events. A histopathology-driven 5-gene expression signature predicted disease progression and clinical events in patients with NASH with F3 (pre-cirrhotic) and F4 (cirrhotic) fibrosis. Notably, the Notch signaling pathway and genes implicated in liver-related diseases were enriched in this expression signature. In a validation cohort where pharmacologic intervention improved disease histology, multiple Notch signaling components were suppressed.

Abstract: Summary
Deep learning (DL) can predict microsatellite instability (MSI) from routine histopathology slides of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is unclear whether DL can also predict other biomarkers with high performance and whether DL predictions generalize to external patient populations. Here, we acquire CRC tissue samples from two large multi-centric studies. We systematically compare six different state-of-the-art DL architectures to predict biomarkers from pathology slides, including MSI and mutations in BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, and PIK3CA. Using a large external validation cohort to provide a realistic evaluation setting, we show that models using self-supervised, attention-based multiple-instance learning consistently outperform previous approaches while offering explainable visualizations of the indicative regions and morphologies. While the prediction of MSI and BRAF mutations reaches a clinical-grade performance, mutation prediction of PIK3CA, KRAS, and NRAS was clinically insufficient.

Abstract: Summary
We present a deep-learning-based platform, MIND-S, for protein post-translational modification (PTM) predictions. MIND-S employs a multi-head attention and graph neural network and assembles a 15-fold ensemble model in a multi-label strategy to enable simultaneous prediction of multiple PTMs with high performance and computation efficiency. MIND-S also features an interpretation module, which provides the relevance of each amino acid for making the predictions and is validated with known motifs. The interpretation module also captures PTM patterns without any supervision. Furthermore, MIND-S enables examination of mutation effects on PTMs. We document a workflow, its applications to 26 types of PTMs of two datasets consisting of ∼50,000 proteins, and an example of MIND-S identifying a PTM-interrupting SNP with validation from biological data. We also include use case analyses of targeted proteins. Taken together, we have demonstrated that MIND-S is accurate, interpretable, and efficient to elucidate PTM-relevant biological processes in health and diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Disruptions to the intestinal microbiome during weaning lead to negative effects on host immune function. However, the critical host-microbe interactions during weaning that are required for immune system development remain poorly understood. We find that restricting microbiome maturation during weaning stunts immune system development and increases susceptibility to enteric infection. We developed a gnotobiotic mouse model of the early-life microbiome Pediatric Community (PedsCom). These mice develop fewer peripheral regulatory T cells and less IgA, hallmarks of microbiota-driven immune system development. Furthermore, adult PedsCom mice retain high susceptibility to Salmonella infection, which is characteristic of young mice and children. Altogether, our work illustrates how the post-weaning transition in microbiome composition contributes to normal immune maturation and protection from infection. Accurate modeling of the pre-weaning microbiome provides a window into the microbial requirements for healthy development and suggests an opportunity to design microbial interventions at weaning to improve immune development in human infants.

Abstract: Summary
Immunocompromised hematology patients are vulnerable to severe COVID-19 and respond poorly to vaccination. Relative deficits in immunity are, however, unclear, especially after 3 vaccine doses. We evaluated immune responses in hematology patients across three COVID-19 vaccination doses. Seropositivity was low after a first dose of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 (∼26%), increased to 59%–75% after a second dose, and increased to 85% after a third dose. While prototypical antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell responses were elicited in healthy participants, hematology patients showed prolonged ASCs and skewed Tfh2/17 responses. Importantly, vaccine-induced expansions of spike-specific and peptide-HLA tetramer-specific CD4+/CD8+ T cells, together with their T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, were robust in hematology patients, irrespective of B cell numbers, and comparable to healthy participants. Vaccinated patients with breakthrough infections developed higher antibody responses, while T cell responses were comparable to healthy groups. COVID-19 vaccination induces robust T cell immunity in hematology patients of varying diseases and treatments irrespective of B cell numbers and antibody response.

Abstract: Summary
While HIV-1-mediated CD4 downregulation protects infected cells from antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), shed gp120 binds to CD4 on uninfected bystander CD4+ T cells, sensitizing them to ADCC mediated by HIV+ plasma. Soluble gp120-CD4 interaction on multiple immune cells also triggers a cytokine burst. The small molecule temsavir acts as an HIV-1 attachment inhibitor by preventing envelope glycoprotein (Env)-CD4 interaction and alters the overall antigenicity of Env by affecting its processing and glycosylation. Here we show that temsavir also blocks the immunomodulatory activities of shed gp120. Temsavir prevents shed gp120 from interacting with uninfected bystander CD4+ cells, protecting them from ADCC responses and preventing a cytokine burst. Mechanistically, this depends on temsavir’s capacity to prevent soluble gp120-CD4 interaction, to reduce gp120 shedding, and to alter gp120 antigenicity. This suggests that the clinical benefits provided by temsavir could extend beyond blocking viral entry.

Abstract: Summary
Intramuscular fatty infiltration in muscle injuries and diseases, caused by aberrant adipogenesis of fibro-adipogenic progenitors, negatively impacts function. Intramuscular delivery of wingless-type MMTV integration site family 7a (WNT7A) offers a promising strategy to stimulate muscle regeneration, but its effects on adipogenic conversion of fibro-adipogenic progenitors remain unknown. Here, we show that WNT7A decreases adipogenesis of fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) by inducing nuclear localization of Yes-associated protein (YAP) through Rho in a β-CATENIN-independent manner and by promoting nuclear retention of YAP and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in differentiating FAPs. Furthermore, intramuscular injection of WNT7A in vivo effectively suppresses fatty infiltration in mice following glycerol-induced injury. Our results collectively suggest WNT7A as a potential protein-based therapeutic for diminishing adipogenesis of FAPs and intramuscular fatty infiltration in pathological muscle injuries or diseases.

Abstract: Summary
RNA viruses continue to remain a threat for potential pandemics due to their rapid evolution. Potentiating host antiviral pathways to prevent or limit viral infections is a promising strategy. Thus, by testing a library of innate immune agonists targeting pathogen recognition receptors, we observe that Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), stimulator of interferon genes (STING), TLR8, and Dectin-1 ligands inhibit arboviruses, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), West Nile virus, and Zika virus to varying degrees. STING agonists (cAIMP, diABZI, and 2′,3′-cGAMP) and Dectin-1 agonist scleroglucan demonstrate the most potent, broad-spectrum antiviral function. Furthermore, STING agonists inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) infection in cardiomyocytes. Transcriptome analysis reveals that cAIMP treatment rescue cells from CHIKV-induced dysregulation of cell repair, immune, and metabolic pathways. In addition, cAIMP provides protection against CHIKV in a chronic CHIKV-arthritis mouse model. Our study describes innate immune signaling circuits crucial for RNA virus replication and identifies broad-spectrum antivirals effective against multiple families of pandemic potential RNA viruses.

Abstract: Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite an overall downward trend in cancer mortality, HCC-related mortality continues to increase. KIFC3 is involved in cell division and cancers. However, the role of KIFC3 in HCC has yet to be elucidated.
Methods
A total of 36 cases of HCC tissues, 4 HCC cell lines, and TCGA databases were searched to explore the expression of KIFC3 in HCC. Subsequently, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, bioinformatic analysis, molecular docking, and Co-IP were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of KIFC3 in HCC.
Result
We found that the expression of KIFC3 was upregulated in HCC, and high KIFC3 expression was related to poor overall survival. In addition, the knockdown of KIFC3 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells in vitro, and impeded the growth of HCC in vivo, while overexpression of KIFC3 in HCC cells revealed the opposite effect. Mechanistically, KIFC3 promotes the progression of HCC through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling. And KIFC3 had slight effect on the protein expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT and p-mTOR in TRIP13-ablated or LY294002-treated HCC cells. The KIFC3 knockdown could further enhance the inhibitory effect of LY294002.
Conclusion
Our data revealed that KIFC3 is upregulated in HCC and may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting survival in HCC patients. Targeting KIFC3 may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC patients.

Abstract: Our goal is to demonstrate and characterize acute glucocorticoid transcriptome response in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neural cultures. Toward this, we confirmed the differentiation of hESC lines H9 and H1 into post-mitotic neurons and astrocytes, in addition to the expressions of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein, and the GR co-chaperone FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5). In a series of experiments in hESC-derived neural cultures treated with dexamethasone (Dex) for 6 h, glucocorticoid hormone (GH) response was detected through the transcriptional upregulation of GH-responsive genes, FKBP5 and PER1. Both genes responded to Dex treatment in a dose-dependent fashion, and FKBP5 protein was significantly upregulated after a 12-hour Dex exposure. We additionally examined the transcriptome-wide effects of acute GH exposure in hESC-derived cultures and identified FKBP5 as the most highly up-regulated gene. We identified 30 additional differentially expressed (DE) genes common to cultures derived from both H9 and H1 hESCs whose expression levels changed in both lines with similar magnitudes and direction.

Abstract: Summary
Serological assays are important diagnostic tools for surveying exposure to the pathogen, monitoring immune response post vaccination, and managing spread of the infectious agent among the population. Current serological laboratory assays are often limited because they require the use of specialized laboratory technology and/or work with a limited number of sample types. Here, we evaluate an alternative by developing time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) homogeneous assays that exhibited exceptional versatility, scalability, and sensitivity and outperformed or matched currently used strategies in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and precision. We validated the performance of the assays measuring total immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels; antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV spike (S) protein; and SARS-CoV-2 S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins and applied it to several large sample sets and real-world applications. We further established a TR-FRET-based ACE2-S competition assay to assess the neutralization propensity of the antibodies. Overall, these TR-FRET-based serological assays can be rapidly extended to other antigens and are compatible with commonly used plate readers.

Abstract: Summary
Hyperspectral fluorescence imaging improves multiplexed observations of biological samples by utilizing multiple color channels across the spectral range to compensate for spectral overlap between labels. Typically, spectral resolution comes at a cost of decreased detection efficiency, which both hampers imaging speed and increases photo-toxicity to the samples. Here, we present a high-speed, high-efficiency snapshot spectral acquisition method, based on optical compression of the fluorescence spectra via Fourier transform, that overcomes the challenges of discrete spectral sampling: single-shot hyperspectral phasor camera (SHy-Cam). SHy-Cam captures fluorescence spatial and spectral information in a single exposure with a standard scientific CMOS camera, with photon efficiency of over 80%, easily and with acquisition rates exceeding 30 datasets per second, making it a powerful tool for multi-color in vivo imaging. Its simple design, using readily available optical components, and its easy integration provide a low-cost solution for multi-color fluorescence imaging with increased efficiency and speed.

Abstract: Summary
Bispecific T cell engagers (bsTCEs) hold great promise for cancer treatment but face challenges due to the induction of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), on-target off-tumor toxicity, and the engagement of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells that limit efficacy. The development of Vγ9Vδ2-T cell engagers may overcome these challenges by combining high therapeutic efficacy with limited toxicity. By linking a CD1d-specific single-domain antibody (VHH) to a Vδ2-TCR-specific VHH, we create a bsTCE with trispecific properties, which engages not only Vγ9Vδ2-T cells but also type 1 NKT cells to CD1d+ tumors and triggers robust proinflammatory cytokine production, effector cell expansion, and target cell lysis in vitro. We show that CD1d is expressed by the majority of patient MM, (myelo)monocytic AML, and CLL cells and that the bsTCE triggers type 1 NKT and Vγ9Vδ2-T cell-mediated antitumor activity against these patient tumor cells and improves survival in in vivo AML, MM, and T-ALL mouse models. Evaluation of a surrogate CD1d-γδ bsTCE in NHPs shows Vγ9Vδ2-T cell engagement and excellent tolerability. Based on these results, CD1d-Vδ2 bsTCE (LAVA-051) is now evaluated in a phase 1/2a study in patients with therapy refractory CLL, MM, or AML.

Abstract: Berberine (BBR) is an effective drug against liver fibrosis (LF). Autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of LF; however, the mechanism linking BBR to autophagy in LF remains unresolved. To explore the underlying mechanism, we assessed the effects of BBR on autophagy and apoptosis of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in vitro and in a murine model of fibrosis. The decreased expression of the autophagy activation marker ATG5, autophagosome formation, and autophagy flux in the HSC model confirmed that BBR inhibited autophagy in activated HSCs and in mice with liver fibrosis. Moreover, ATG5 was necessary for inducing autophagy and HSC activation. BBR suppressed ATG5 expression by upregulating miR-30a-5p expression, which affected the stability of ATG5 mRNA by binding to its 3′-untranslated region, an effect that was attenuated by treatment with a miR-30a-5p inhibitor. BBR also markedly induced HSC apoptosis, as indicated by the upregulated expression of the pro-apoptosis markers p53, BAX, and cleaved PARP and the downregulated expression of the anti-apoptosis marker BCL-2, effects that were reversed by ATG5 overexpression. In vivo, BBR improved mouse LF by decreasing collagen deposition, inflammatory cell infiltration, and expression of fibrosis markers hydroxyproline, α-smooth muscle actin, and collagen type 1-A1 and the autophagy marker LC3. BBR had a protective effect on mouse fibrotic livers and reduced serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. Collectively, these results reveal a novel mechanism of BBR-induced autophagy inhibition triggering apoptosis in HSCs, providing a reliable experimental and theoretical basis for developing BBR-based candidate drugs for LF.

Abstract: Summary
Under the ever-present threat of a pandemic influenza strain, the evolution of a broadly reactive, neutralizing, functional, humoral immune response may hold the key to protection against both circulating and emerging influenza strains. We apply a systems approach to profile hemagglutinin- and neuraminidase-specific humoral signatures that track with the evolution of broad immunity in a cohort of vaccinated individuals and validate these findings in a second longitudinal cohort. Multivariate analysis reveals the presence of a unique pre-existing Fcγ-receptor-binding antibody profile in individuals that evolved broadly reactive hemagglutination inhibition activity (HAI), marked by the presence of elevated levels of pre-existing FCGR2B-binding antibodies. Moreover, vaccination with FCGR2B-binding antibody-opsonized influenza results in enhanced antibody titers and HAI activity in a murine model. Together, these data suggest that pre-existing FCGR2B binding antibodies are a key correlate of the evolution of broadly protective influenza-specific antibodies, providing insight for the design of next-generation influenza vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
This is a phase II study of PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy as preoperative therapy for patients with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC or BRPC, respectively). Twenty-nine patients are enrolled in the study. The objective response rate (ORR) is 60%, and the R0 resection rate is 90% (9/10). The 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate and 12-month overall survival (OS) rate are 64% and 72%, respectively. Grade 3 or higher adverse events are anemia (8%), thrombocytopenia (8%), and jaundice (8%). Circulating tumor DNA analysis reveals that patients with a >50% decline in maximal somatic variant allelic frequency (maxVAF) between the first clinical evaluation and baseline have a longer survival outcome and a higher response rate and surgical rate than those who are not. PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy as preoperative therapy displays promising antitumor activity, and multiomics potential predictive biomarkers are identified and warrant further verification.

Abstract: Summary
Rotavirus assembly is a complex process that involves the stepwise acquisition of protein layers in distinct intracellular locations to form the fully assembled particle. Understanding and visualization of the assembly process has been hampered by the inaccessibility of unstable intermediates. We characterize the assembly pathway of group A rotaviruses observed in situ within cryo-preserved infected cells through the use of cryoelectron tomography of cellular lamellae. Our findings demonstrate that the viral polymerase VP1 recruits viral genomes during particle assembly, as revealed by infecting with a conditionally lethal mutant. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition to arrest the transiently enveloped stage uncovered a unique conformation of the VP4 spike. Subtomogram averaging provided atomic models of four intermediate states, including a pre-packaging single-layered intermediate, the double-layered particle, the transiently enveloped double-layered particle, and the fully assembled triple-layered virus particle. In summary, these complementary approaches enable us to elucidate the discrete steps involved in forming an intracellular rotavirus particle.

Abstract: Summary
Hyperpolarizing GABAAR currents, the unitary events that underlie synaptic inhibition, are dependent upon efficient Cl− extrusion, a process that is facilitated by the neuronal specific K+/Cl− co-transporter KCC2. Its activity is also a determinant of the anticonvulsant efficacy of the canonical GABAAR-positive allosteric: benzodiazepines (BDZs). Compromised KCC2 activity is implicated in the pathophysiology of status epilepticus (SE), a medical emergency that rapidly becomes refractory to BDZ (BDZ-RSE). Here, we have identified small molecules that directly bind to and activate KCC2, which leads to reduced neuronal Cl− accumulation and excitability. KCC2 activation does not induce any overt effects on behavior but prevents the development of and terminates ongoing BDZ-RSE. In addition, KCC2 activation reduces neuronal cell death following BDZ-RSE. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that KCC2 activation is a promising strategy to terminate BDZ-resistant seizures and limit the associated neuronal injury.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can modulate protein function through cysteine oxidation. Identifying protein targets of ROS can provide insight into uncharacterized ROS-regulated pathways. Several redox-proteomic workflows, such as oxidative isotope-coded affinity tags (OxICAT), exist to identify sites of cysteine oxidation. However, determining ROS targets localized within subcellular compartments and ROS hotspots remains challenging with existing workflows. Here, we present a chemoproteomic platform, PL-OxICAT, which combines proximity labeling (PL) with OxICAT to monitor localized cysteine oxidation events. We show that TurboID-based PL-OxICAT can monitor cysteine oxidation events within subcellular compartments such as the mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane space. Furthermore, we use ascorbate peroxidase (APEX)-based PL-OxICAT to monitor oxidation events within ROS hotspots by using endogenous ROS as the source of peroxide for APEX activation. Together, these platforms further hone our ability to monitor cysteine oxidation events within specific subcellular locations and ROS hotspots and provide a deeper understanding of the protein targets of endogenous and exogenous ROS.

Abstract: Summary
Drug platforms that enable the directed delivery of therapeutics to sites of diseases to maximize efficacy and limit off-target effects are needed. Here, we report the development of PROT3EcT, a suite of commensal Escherichia coli engineered to secrete proteins directly into their surroundings. These bacteria consist of three modular components: a modified bacterial protein secretion system, the associated regulatable transcriptional activator, and a secreted therapeutic payload. PROT3EcT secrete functional single-domain antibodies, nanobodies (Nbs), and stably colonize and maintain an active secretion system within the intestines of mice. Furthermore, a single prophylactic dose of a variant of PROT3EcT that secretes a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-neutralizing Nb is sufficient to ablate pro-inflammatory TNF levels and prevent the development of injury and inflammation in a chemically induced model of colitis. This work lays the foundation for developing PROT3EcT as a platform for the treatment of gastrointestinal-based diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stimulation can alleviate paralysis and sensory deficits. Novel high-density neural interfaces can enable refined and multipronged neurostimulation interventions. To achieve this, it is essential to develop algorithmic frameworks capable of handling optimization in large parameter spaces. Here, we leveraged an algorithmic class, Gaussian-process (GP)-based Bayesian optimization (BO), to solve this problem. We show that GP-BO efficiently explores the neurostimulation space, outperforming other search strategies after testing only a fraction of the possible combinations. Through a series of real-time multi-dimensional neurostimulation experiments, we demonstrate optimization across diverse biological targets (brain, spinal cord), animal models (rats, non-human primates), in healthy subjects, and in neuroprosthetic intervention after injury, for both immediate and continual learning over multiple sessions. GP-BO can embed and improve “prior” expert/clinical knowledge to dramatically enhance its performance. These results advocate for broader establishment of learning agents as structural elements of neuroprosthetic design, enabling personalization and maximization of therapeutic effectiveness.

Abstract: ORP8 has been reported to suppress tumor progression in various malignancies. However, the functions and underlying mechanisms of ORP8 are still unknown in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, decreased expression of ORP8 was detected in RCC tissues and cell lines. Functional assays verified that ORP8 suppressed RCC cell growth, migration, invasion, and metastasis. Mechanistically, ORP8 attenuated Stathmin1 expression by accelerating ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation and led to an increase in microtubule polymerization. Lastly, ORP8 knockdown partly rescued microtubule polymerization, as well as aggressive cell phenotypes induced by paclitaxel. Our findings elucidated that ORP8 suppressed the malignant progression of RCC by increasing Stathmin1 degradation and microtubule polymerization, thus suggesting that ORP8 might be a novel target for the treatment of RCC.

Abstract: Summary
Confocal Raman spectral imaging (RSI) enables high-content, label-free visualization of a wide range of molecules in biological specimens without sample preparation. However, reliable quantification of the deconvoluted spectra is needed. Here we develop an integrated bioanalytical methodology, qRamanomics, to qualify RSI as a tissue phantom calibrated tool for quantitative spatial chemotyping of major classes of biomolecules. Next, we apply qRamanomics to fixed 3D liver organoids generated from stem-cell-derived or primary hepatocytes to assess specimen variation and maturity. We then demonstrate the utility of qRamanomics for identifying biomolecular response signatures from a panel of liver-altering drugs, probing drug-induced compositional changes in 3D organoids followed by in situ monitoring of drug metabolism and accumulation. Quantitative chemometric phenotyping constitutes an important step in developing quantitative label-free interrogation of 3D biological specimens.

Abstract: Summary
Primary and secondary bile acids (BAs) influence metabolism and inflammation, and the gut microbiome modulates levels of BAs. We systematically explore the host genetic, gut microbial, and habitual dietary contribution to a panel of 19 serum and 15 stool BAs in two population-based cohorts (TwinsUK, n = 2,382; ZOE PREDICT-1, n = 327) and assess changes post-bariatric surgery and after nutritional interventions. We report that BAs have a moderately heritable genetic component, and the gut microbiome accurately predicts their levels in serum and stool. The secondary BA isoursodeoxycholate (isoUDCA) can be explained mostly by gut microbes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = ∼80%) and associates with post-prandial lipemia and inflammation (GlycA). Furthermore, circulating isoUDCA decreases significantly 1 year after bariatric surgery (β = −0.72, p = 1 × 10−5) and in response to fiber supplementation (β = −0.37, p < 0.03) but not omega-3 supplementation. In healthy individuals, isoUDCA fasting levels correlate with pre-meal appetite (p < 1 × 10−4). Our findings indicate an important role for isoUDCA in lipid metabolism, appetite, and, potentially, cardiometabolic risk.

Abstract: Summary
Incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), defined by a diagnosed age under 50 years, is increasing, but its heterogeneous etiologies that differ from general CRC remain undetermined. We initially characterize the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome of tumors from 79 patients in a Chinese CRC cohort. Data for an additional 126 EOCRC subjects are obtained from the International Cancer Genome Consortium Chinese cohort and The Cancer Genome Atlas European cohort. We observe that early-onset tumors have a high tumor mutation burden; increased DNA repair features by mutational signature 3 and multi-layer pathway enrichments; strong perturbations at effects of DNA methylation and somatic copy-number alteration on gene expression; and upregulated immune infiltration as hot tumors underlying immunophenotypes. Notably, LMTK3 exhibits ancestral mutation disparity, potentially being a functional modulator and biomarker that drives molecular alterations in EOCRC development and immunotherapies. This integrative omics study provides valuable knowledge for precision oncology of CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Drug-induced phenotypes result from biomolecular interactions across various levels of a biological system. Characterization of pharmacological actions therefore requires integration of multi-omics data. Proteomics profiles, which may more directly reflect disease mechanisms and biomarkers than transcriptomics, have not been widely exploited due to data scarcity and frequent missing values. A computational method for inferring drug-induced proteome patterns would therefore enable progress in systems pharmacology. To predict the proteome profiles and corresponding phenotypes of an uncharacterized cell or tissue type that has been disturbed by an uncharacterized chemical, we developed an end-to-end deep learning framework: TransPro. TransPro hierarchically integrated multi-omics data, in line with the central dogma of molecular biology. Our in-depth assessments of TransPro’s predictions of anti-cancer drug sensitivity and drug adverse reactions reveal that TransPro’s accuracy is on par with that of experimental data. Hence, TransPro may facilitate the imputation of proteomics data and compound screening in systems pharmacology.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) frequently harbor KRAS mutations. Although MEK inhibitors represent a plausible therapeutic option, most PDACs are innately resistant to these agents. Here, we identify a critical adaptive response that mediates resistance. Specifically, we show that MEK inhibitors upregulate the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 by triggering an association with its deubiquitinase, USP9X, resulting in acute Mcl-1 stabilization and protection from apoptosis. Notably, these findings contrast the canonical positive regulation of Mcl-1 by RAS/ERK. We further show that Mcl-1 inhibitors and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, which suppress Mcl-1 transcription, prevent this protective response and induce tumor regression when combined with MEK inhibitors. Finally, we identify USP9X as an additional potential therapeutic target. Together, these studies (1) demonstrate that USP9X regulates a critical mechanism of resistance in PDAC, (2) reveal an unexpected mechanism of Mcl-1 regulation in response to RAS pathway suppression, and (3) provide multiple distinct promising therapeutic strategies for this deadly malignancy.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits the entry of numerous viruses through undefined molecular mechanisms. IFITM3 localizes in the endosomal-lysosomal system and specifically affects virus fusion with target cell membranes. We found that IFITM3 induces local lipid sorting, resulting in an increased concentration of lipids disfavoring viral fusion at the hemifusion site. This increases the energy barrier for fusion pore formation and the hemifusion dwell time, promoting viral degradation in lysosomes. In situ cryo-electron tomography captured IFITM3-mediated arrest of influenza A virus membrane fusion. Observation of hemifusion diaphragms between viral particles and late endosomal membranes confirmed hemifusion stabilization as a molecular mechanism of IFITM3. The presence of the influenza fusion protein hemagglutinin in post-fusion conformation close to hemifusion sites further indicated that IFITM3 does not interfere with the viral fusion machinery. Collectively, these findings show that IFITM3 induces lipid sorting to stabilize hemifusion and prevent virus entry into target cells.

Abstract: Summary
It is urgent to understand the infection mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 starts when the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of viral spike protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the host cell, but the endocytosis details after this binding are not clear. Here, RBD and ACE2 were genetically coded and labeled with organic dyes to track RBD endocytosis in living cells. The photostable dyes enable long-term structured illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging and to quantify RBD-ACE2 binding (RAB) by the intensity ratio of RBD/ACE2 fluorescence. We resolved RAB endocytosis in living cells, including RBD-ACE2 recognition, cofactor-regulated membrane internalization, RAB-bearing vesicle formation and transport, RAB degradation, and downregulation of ACE2. The RAB was found to activate the RBD internalization. After vesicles were transported and matured within cells, RAB was finally degraded after being taken up by lysosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy plays an essential role in preserving cellular homeostasis in pancreatic beta cells. However, the extent of autophagic flux in pancreatic islets induced in various physiological settings remains unclear. In this study, we generate transgenic mice expressing pHluorin-LC3-mCherry reporter for monitoring systemic autophagic flux by measuring the pHluorin/mCherry ratio, validating them in the starvation and insulin-deficient model. Our findings reveal that autophagic flux in pancreatic islets enhances after starvation, and suppression of the flux after short-term refeeding needs more prolonged re-starvation in islets than in the other insulin-targeted organs. Furthermore, heterogeneity of autophagic flux in pancreatic beta cells manifests under insulin resistance, and intracellular calcium influx by glucose stimulation increases more in high- than low-autophagic flux beta cells, with differential gene expression, including lipoprotein lipase. Our pHluorin-LC3-mCherry mice enable us to reveal biological insight into heterogeneity in autophagic flux in pancreatic beta cells.

Abstract: Background
Aging is characterized by a general decline in cellular function, which ultimately affects whole body homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSC-exos) on the livers of naturally aging mice.
Method
Twenty-two-month-old C57BL6 mice were used as a natural aging animal model, divided into a saline-treated wild‐type aged control group (WT-AC) and a hUCMSC-exo-treated group (WT-AEX), and then detected by morphology, metabolomics and phosphoproteomics.
Results
Morphological analysis showed that hUCMSC-exos ameliorated structural disorder and decreased markers of senescence and genome instability in aging livers. Metabolomics showed that hUCMSC-exos decreased the contents of saturated glycerophospholipids, palmitoyl-glycerols and eicosanoid derivatives associated with lipotoxicity and inflammation, consistent with the decreased phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, such as propionate-CoA ligase (Acss2), at S267 detected by phosphoproteomics. Moreover, phosphoproteomics indicated that hUCMSC-exos reduced the phosphorylation of proteins participating in nuclear transport and cancer signaling, such as heat shock protein HSP90-beta (Hsp90ab1) at S226 and nucleoprotein TPR (Tpr) at S453 and S379, while increasing those involved in intracellular communication, such as calnexin (Canx) at S563 and PDZ domain-containing protein 8 (Pdzd8). Finally, phosphorylated HSP90β and Tpr were verified predominantly in hepatocytes.
Conclusion
HUCMSC-exos improved metabolic reprogramming and genome stability mainly associated with phosphorylated HSP90β in hepatocytes in natural aging livers. This work provides a comprehensive resource of biological data by omics to support future investigations of hUCMSC-exos in aging.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell regulation plays a crucial role during development and homeostasis. Here, an essential source of Wnts from Gli1+ stem/progenitor cells was identified in the murine molar. Loss of Wnt production in Gli1+ apical stem/progenitor cells led to loss of Axin2 at the root apex, mis-regulation of SOX9, loss of BMP and Hh signaling, and truncation of root development. In the absence of Wnt signals, the root epithelium lost its integrity and epithelial identity. This phenotype could be partially mimicked by loss of Sox9 in the Gli1 population. Stabilization of Wnt signaling in the apical papilla led to rapid unordered differentiation of hard tissues and fragmentation of the epithelial root sheath. Wnt signaling from Gli1+ stem/progenitor cells, therefore, orchestrates root development, coordinating mesenchymal and epithelial interactions via SOX9 to regulate stem/progenitor cell expansion and differentiation. Our results demonstrate that disparate stem/progenitor cell populations are unified in their fundamental signaling interactions.

Abstract: Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is a severe cardiovascular disease attributed to the abnormal phenotypic switch of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We found that the RNA-binding protein PUM2 and the fibulin protein EFEMP1 were significantly decreased at the TAD anatomical site. Therefore, we constructed expression and silencing vectors for PUM2 and EFEMP1 to analyze differential expression. Overexpression of PUM2 inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration. Western blot analysis indicated that PUM2 overexpression in VSMCs upregulated α-SMA and SM22α and downregulated OPN and MMP2. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that PUM2 and EFEMP1 were co-expressed in VSMCs. Immunoprecipitation confirmed that PUM2 bound to EFEMP1 mRNA to promote EFEMP1 expression. An Ang–II–induced aortic dissection mouse model showed that PUM2 impedes the development of aortic dissection in vivo. Our study demonstrates that PUM2 inhibits the VSMC phenotypic switch to prevent aortic dissection by targeting EFEMP1 mRNA. These findings could assist the development of targeted therapy for TAD.

Abstract: Summary
Light microscopy is a powerful single-cell technique that allows for quantitative spatial information at subcellular resolution. However, unlike flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing techniques, microscopy has issues achieving high-quality population-wide sample characterization while maintaining high resolution. Here, we present a general framework, data-driven microscopy (DDM) that uses real-time population-wide object characterization to enable data-driven high-fidelity imaging of relevant phenotypes based on the population context. DDM combines data-independent and data-dependent steps to synergistically enhance data acquired using different imaging modalities. As a proof of concept, we develop and apply DDM with plugins for improved high-content screening and live adaptive microscopy for cell migration and infection studies that capture events of interest, rare or common, with high precision and resolution. We propose that DDM can reduce human bias, increase reproducibility, and place single-cell characteristics in the context of the sample population when interpreting microscopy data, leading to an increase in overall data fidelity.
