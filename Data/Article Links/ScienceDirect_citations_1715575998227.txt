Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome is complex, raising questions about the role of individual strains in the community. Here, we address this question by constructing variants of a complex defined community in which we eliminate strains that occupy the bile acid 7α-dehydroxylation niche. Omitting Clostridium scindens (Cs) and Clostridium hylemonae (Ch) eliminates secondary bile acid production and reshapes the community in a highly specific manner: eight strains change in relative abundance by >100-fold. In single-strain dropout communities, Cs and Ch reach the same relative abundance and dehydroxylate bile acids to a similar extent. However, Clostridium sporogenes increases >1,000-fold in the ΔCs but not ΔCh dropout, reshaping the pool of microbiome-derived phenylalanine metabolites. Thus, strains that are functionally redundant within a niche can have widely varying impacts outside the niche, and a strain swap can ripple through the community in an unpredictable manner, resulting in a large impact on an unrelated community-level phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Patescibacteria, also known as the candidate phyla radiation (CPR), are a diverse group of bacteria that constitute a disproportionately large fraction of microbial dark matter. Its few cultivated members, belonging mostly to Saccharibacteria, grow as epibionts on host Actinobacteria. Due to a lack of suitable tools, the genetic basis of this lifestyle and other unique features of Patescibacteira remain unexplored. Here, we show that Saccharibacteria exhibit natural competence, and we exploit this property for their genetic manipulation. Imaging of fluorescent protein-labeled Saccharibacteria provides high spatiotemporal resolution of phenomena accompanying epibiotic growth, and a transposon-insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) genome-wide screen reveals the contribution of enigmatic Saccharibacterial genes to growth on their hosts. Finally, we leverage metagenomic data to provide cutting-edge protein structure-based bioinformatic resources that support the strain Southlakia epibionticum and its corresponding host, Actinomyces israelii, as a model system for unlocking the molecular underpinnings of the epibiotic lifestyle.

Abstract: Summary
Animals with complex nervous systems demand sleep for memory consolidation and synaptic remodeling. Here, we show that, although the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system has a limited number of neurons, sleep is necessary for both processes. In addition, it is unclear if, in any system, sleep collaborates with experience to alter synapses between specific neurons and whether this ultimately affects behavior. C. elegans neurons have defined connections and well-described contributions to behavior. We show that spaced odor-training and post-training sleep induce long-term memory. Memory consolidation, but not acquisition, requires a pair of interneurons, the AIYs, which play a role in odor-seeking behavior. In worms that consolidate memory, both sleep and odor conditioning are required to diminish inhibitory synaptic connections between the AWC chemosensory neurons and the AIYs. Thus, we demonstrate in a living organism that sleep is required for events immediately after training that drive memory consolidation and alter synaptic structures.

Abstract: Summary
Certain cancer types afflict female and male patients disproportionately. The reasons include differences in male/female physiology, effect of sex hormones, risk behavior, environmental exposures, and genetics of the sex chromosomes X and Y. Loss of Y (LOY) is common in peripheral blood cells in aging men, and this phenomenon is associated with several diseases. However, the frequency and role of LOY in tumors is little understood. Here, we present a comprehensive catalog of LOY in >5,000 primary tumors from male patients in the TCGA. We show that LOY rates vary by tumor type and provide evidence for LOY being either a passenger or driver event depending on context. LOY in uveal melanoma specifically is associated with age and survival and is an independent predictor of poor outcome. LOY creates common dependencies on DDX3X and EIF1AX in male cell lines, suggesting that LOY generates unique vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited.

Abstract: Summary
Tn7-like transposons have co-opted CRISPR-Cas systems to facilitate the movement of their own DNA. These CRISPR-associated transposons (CASTs) are promising tools for programmable gene knockin. A key feature of CASTs is their ability to recruit Tn7-like transposons to nuclease-deficient CRISPR effectors. However, how Tn7-like transposons are recruited by diverse CRISPR effectors remains poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of a recruitment complex comprising the Cascade complex, TniQ, TnsC, and the target DNA in the type I-B CAST from Peltigera membranacea cyanobiont 210A. Target DNA recognition by Cascade induces conformational changes in Cas6 and primes TniQ recruitment through its C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain of TniQ is bound to the seam region of the TnsC spiral heptamer. Our findings provide insights into the diverse mechanisms for the recruitment of Tn7-like transposons to CRISPR effectors and will aid in the development of CASTs as gene knockin tools.

Abstract: Summary
Social preference, the decision to interact with one member of the same species over another, is critical to optimize social interactions. Thus, adult rodents favor interacting with novel conspecifics over familiar ones, but whether this social preference stems from neural circuits facilitating interactions with novel individuals or suppressing interactions with familiar ones remains unknown. Here, we identify neurons in the infra-limbic area (ILA) of the mouse prefrontal cortex that express the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and project to the dorsal region of the rostral lateral septum (rLS). We show how release of CRH during familiar encounters disinhibits rLS neurons, thereby suppressing social interactions with familiar mice and contributing to social novelty preference. We further demonstrate how the maturation of CRH expression in ILA during the first 2 post-natal weeks enables the developmental shift from a preference for littermates in juveniles to a preference for novel mice in adults.

Abstract: Summary
Immune-checkpoint blockade has revolutionized cancer treatment, but some cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), do not respond or develop resistance. A potential mode of resistance is immune evasion of T cell immunity involving aberrant major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) antigen presentation (AP). To map such mechanisms of resistance, we identified key MHC-I regulators using specific peptide-MHC-I-guided CRISPR-Cas9 screens in AML. The top-ranked negative regulators were surface protein sushi domain containing 6 (SUSD6), transmembrane protein 127 (TMEM127), and the E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP2. SUSD6 is abundantly expressed in AML and multiple solid cancers, and its ablation enhanced MHC-I AP and reduced tumor growth in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. Mechanistically, SUSD6 forms a trimolecular complex with TMEM127 and MHC-I, which recruits WWP2 for MHC-I ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. Together with the SUSD6/TMEM127/WWP2 gene signature, which negatively correlates with cancer survival, our findings define a membrane-associated MHC-I inhibitory axis as a potential therapeutic target for both leukemia and solid cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Animal fertilization relies on hundreds of sperm racing toward the egg, whereas, in angiosperms, only two sperm cells are delivered by a pollen tube to the female gametes (egg cell and central cell) for double fertilization. However, unsuccessful fertilization under this one-pollen-tube design can be detrimental to seed production and plant survival. To mitigate this risk, unfertilized-gamete-controlled extra pollen tube entry has been evolved to bring more sperm cells and salvage fertilization. Despite its importance, the underlying molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we report that, in Arabidopsis, the central cell secretes peptides SALVAGER1 and SALVAGER2 in a directional manner to attract pollen tubes when the synergid-dependent attraction fails or is terminated by pollen tubes carrying infertile sperm cells. Moreover, loss of SALs impairs the fertilization recovery capacity of the ovules. Therefore, this research uncovers a female gamete-attraction system that salvages seed production for reproductive assurance.

Abstract: Summary
Cholesterol efflux pathways could be exploited in tumor biology to unravel cancer vulnerabilities. A mouse model of lung-tumor-bearing KRASG12D mutation with specific disruption of cholesterol efflux pathways in epithelial progenitor cells promoted tumor growth. Defective cholesterol efflux in epithelial progenitor cells governed their transcriptional landscape to support their expansion and create a pro-tolerogenic tumor microenvironment (TME). Overexpression of the apolipoprotein A-I, to raise HDL levels, protected these mice from tumor development and dire pathologic consequences. Mechanistically, HDL blunted a positive feedback loop between growth factor signaling pathways and cholesterol efflux pathways that cancer cells hijack to expand. Cholesterol removal therapy with cyclodextrin reduced tumor burden in progressing tumor by suppressing the proliferation and expansion of epithelial progenitor cells of tumor origin. Local and systemic perturbations of cholesterol efflux pathways were confirmed in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Our results position cholesterol removal therapy as a putative metabolic target in lung cancer progenitor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Thrombopoietin (THPO or TPO) is an essential cytokine for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance and megakaryocyte differentiation. Here, we report the 3.4 Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy structure of the extracellular TPO-TPO receptor (TpoR or MPL) signaling complex, revealing the basis for homodimeric MPL activation and providing a structural rationalization for genetic loss-of-function thrombocytopenia mutations. The structure guided the engineering of TPO variants (TPOmod) with a spectrum of signaling activities, from neutral antagonists to partial- and super-agonists. Partial agonist TPOmod decoupled JAK/STAT from ERK/AKT/CREB activation, driving a bias for megakaryopoiesis and platelet production without causing significant HSC expansion in mice and showing superior maintenance of human HSCs in vitro. These data demonstrate the functional uncoupling of the two primary roles of TPO, highlighting the potential utility of TPOmod in hematology research and clinical HSC transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
The elucidation of protein function and its exploitation in bioengineering have greatly advanced the life sciences. Protein mining efforts generally rely on amino acid sequences rather than protein structures. We describe here the use of AlphaFold2 to predict and subsequently cluster an entire protein family based on predicted structure similarities. We selected deaminase proteins to analyze and identified many previously unknown properties. We were surprised to find that most proteins in the DddA-like clade were not double-stranded DNA deaminases. We engineered the smallest single-strand-specific cytidine deaminase, enabling efficient cytosine base editor (CBE) to be packaged into a single adeno-associated virus (AAV). Importantly, we profiled a deaminase from this clade that edits robustly in soybean plants, which previously was inaccessible to CBEs. These discovered deaminases, based on AI-assisted structural predictions, greatly expand the utility of base editors for therapeutic and agricultural applications.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt ligands oligomerize Frizzled (Fzd) and Lrp5/6 receptors to control the specification and activity of stem cells in many species. How Wnt signaling is selectively activated in different stem cell populations, often within the same organ, is not understood. In lung alveoli, we show that distinct Wnt receptors are expressed by epithelial (Fzd5/6), endothelial (Fzd4), and stromal (Fzd1) cells. Fzd5 is uniquely required for alveolar epithelial stem cell activity, whereas fibroblasts utilize distinct Fzd receptors. Using an expanded repertoire of Fzd-Lrp agonists, we could activate canonical Wnt signaling in alveolar epithelial stem cells via either Fzd5 or, unexpectedly, non-canonical Fzd6. A Fzd5 agonist (Fzd5ag) or Fzd6ag stimulated alveolar epithelial stem cell activity and promoted survival in mice after lung injury, but only Fzd6ag promoted an alveolar fate in airway-derived progenitors. Therefore, we identify a potential strategy for promoting regeneration without exacerbating fibrosis during lung injury.

Abstract: Summary
All eukaryotes require intricate protein networks to translate developmental signals into accurate cell fate decisions. Mutations that disturb interactions between network components often result in disease, but how the composition and dynamics of complex networks are established remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the E3 ligase UBR5 as a signaling hub that helps degrade unpaired subunits of multiple transcriptional regulators that act within a network centered on the c-Myc oncoprotein. Biochemical and structural analyses show that UBR5 binds motifs that only become available upon complex dissociation. By rapidly turning over unpaired transcription factor subunits, UBR5 establishes dynamic interactions between transcriptional regulators that allow cells to effectively execute gene expression while remaining receptive to environmental signals. We conclude that orphan quality control plays an essential role in establishing dynamic protein networks, which may explain the conserved need for protein degradation during transcription and offers opportunities to modulate gene expression in disease.

Abstract: Summary
Plant roots encounter numerous pathogenic microbes that often cause devastating diseases. One such pathogen, Plasmodiophora brassicae (Pb), causes clubroot disease and severe yield losses on cruciferous crops worldwide. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of WeiTsing (WTS), a broad-spectrum clubroot resistance gene from Arabidopsis. WTS is transcriptionally activated in the pericycle upon Pb infection to prevent pathogen colonization in the stele. Brassica napus carrying the WTS transgene displayed strong resistance to Pb. WTS encodes a small protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and its expression in plants induces immune responses. The cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of WTS revealed a previously unknown pentameric architecture with a central pore. Electrophysiology analyses demonstrated that WTS is a calcium-permeable cation-selective channel. Structure-guided mutagenesis indicated that channel activity is strictly required for triggering defenses. The findings uncover an ion channel analogous to resistosomes that triggers immune signaling in the pericycle.

Abstract: Summary
Discerning the effect of pharmacological exposures on intestinal bacterial communities in cancer patients is challenging. Here, we deconvoluted the relationship between drug exposures and changes in microbial composition by developing and applying a new computational method, PARADIGM (parameters associated with dynamics of gut microbiota), to a large set of longitudinal fecal microbiome profiles with detailed medication-administration records from patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. We observed that several non-antibiotic drugs, including laxatives, antiemetics, and opioids, are associated with increased Enterococcus relative abundance and decreased alpha diversity. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing further demonstrated subspecies competition, leading to increased dominant-strain genetic convergence during allo-HCT that is significantly associated with antibiotic exposures. We integrated drug-microbiome associations to predict clinical outcomes in two validation cohorts on the basis of drug exposures alone, suggesting that this approach can generate biologically and clinically relevant insights into how pharmacological exposures can perturb or preserve microbiota composition. The application of a computational method called PARADIGM to a large dataset of cancer patients’ longitudinal fecal specimens and detailed daily medication records reveals associations between drug exposures and the intestinal microbiota that recapitulate in vitro findings and are also predictive of clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Dopaminergic projections regulate various brain functions and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. There are two anatomically and functionally distinct dopaminergic projections connecting the midbrain to striatum: nigrostriatal, which controls movement, and mesolimbic, which regulates motivation. However, how these discrete dopaminergic synaptic connections are established is unknown. Through an unbiased search, we identify that two groups of antagonistic TGF-β family members, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)6/BMP2 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2, regulate dopaminergic synapse development of nigrostriatal and mesolimbic neurons, respectively. Projection-preferential expression of their receptors contributes to specific synapse development. Downstream, Smad1 and Smad2 are specifically activated and required for dopaminergic synapse development and function in nigrostriatal vs. mesolimbic projections. Remarkably, Smad1 mutant mice show motor defects, whereas Smad2 mutant mice show lack of motivation. These results uncover the molecular logic underlying the proper establishment of functionally segregated dopaminergic synapses and may provide strategies to treat relevant, projection-specific disease symptoms by targeting specific BMPs/TGF-β and/or Smads.

Organoids offer a compelling platform to study scarce tissues in vitro; however, derivation of cochlear cell types has proven non-trivial. Here, using 3D cultures of human pluripotent stem cells, we sought to replicate key differentiation cues of cochlear specification. We found that timed modulations of Sonic Hedgehog and WNT signaling promote ventral gene expression in otic progenitors. Ventralized otic progenitors subsequently give rise to elaborately patterned epithelia containing hair cells with morphology, marker expression, and functional properties consistent with both outer and inner hair cells in the cochlea. These results suggest that early morphogenic cues are sufficient to drive cochlear induction and establish an unprecedented system to model the human auditory organ.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells play indispensable roles in innate immune responses against tumor progression. To depict their phenotypic and functional diversities in the tumor microenvironment, we perform integrative single-cell RNA sequencing analyses on NK cells from 716 patients with cancer, covering 24 cancer types. We observed heterogeneity in NK cell composition in a tumor-type-specific manner. Notably, we have identified a group of tumor-associated NK cells that are enriched in tumors, show impaired anti-tumor functions, and are associated with unfavorable prognosis and resistance to immunotherapy. Specific myeloid cell subpopulations, in particular LAMP3+ dendritic cells, appear to mediate the regulation of NK cell anti-tumor immunity. Our study provides insights into NK-cell-based cancer immunity and highlights potential clinical utilities of NK cell subsets as therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation can trigger lasting phenotypes in immune and non-immune cells. Whether and how human infections and associated inflammation can form innate immune memory in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) has remained unclear. We found that circulating HSPC, enriched from peripheral blood, captured the diversity of bone marrow HSPC, enabling investigation of their epigenomic reprogramming following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Alterations in innate immune phenotypes and epigenetic programs of HSPC persisted for months to 1 year following severe COVID-19 and were associated with distinct transcription factor (TF) activities, altered regulation of inflammatory programs, and durable increases in myelopoiesis. HSPC epigenomic alterations were conveyed, through differentiation, to progeny innate immune cells. Early activity of IL-6 contributed to these persistent phenotypes in human COVID-19 and a mouse coronavirus infection model. Epigenetic reprogramming of HSPC may underlie altered immune function following infection and be broadly relevant, especially for millions of COVID-19 survivors.

Abstract: Summary
Approximately 15% of US adults have circulating levels of uric acid above its solubility limit, which is causally linked to the disease gout. In most mammals, uric acid elimination is facilitated by the enzyme uricase. However, human uricase is a pseudogene, having been inactivated early in hominid evolution. Though it has long been known that uric acid is eliminated in the gut, the role of the gut microbiota in hyperuricemia has not been studied. Here, we identify a widely distributed bacterial gene cluster that encodes a pathway for uric acid degradation. Stable isotope tracing demonstrates that gut bacteria metabolize uric acid to xanthine or short chain fatty acids. Ablation of the microbiota in uricase-deficient mice causes severe hyperuricemia, and anaerobe-targeted antibiotics increase the risk of gout in humans. These data reveal a role for the gut microbiota in uric acid excretion and highlight the potential for microbiome-targeted therapeutics in hyperuricemia.

Abstract: Summary
RNA splicing factors are recurrently mutated in clonal blood disorders, but the impact of dysregulated splicing in hematopoiesis remains unclear. To overcome technical limitations, we integrated genotyping of transcriptomes (GoT) with long-read single-cell transcriptomics and proteogenomics for single-cell profiling of transcriptomes, surface proteins, somatic mutations, and RNA splicing (GoT-Splice). We applied GoT-Splice to hematopoietic progenitors from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with mutations in the core splicing factor SF3B1. SF3B1mut cells were enriched in the megakaryocytic-erythroid lineage, with expansion of SF3B1mut erythroid progenitor cells. We uncovered distinct cryptic 3′ splice site usage in different progenitor populations and stage-specific aberrant splicing during erythroid differentiation. Profiling SF3B1-mutated clonal hematopoiesis samples revealed that erythroid bias and cell-type-specific cryptic 3′ splice site usage in SF3B1mut cells precede overt MDS. Collectively, GoT-Splice defines the cell-type-specific impact of somatic mutations on RNA splicing, from early clonal outgrowths to overt neoplasia, directly in human samples.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advances in human blastoids have opened new avenues for modeling early human development and implantation. One limitation of our first protocol for human blastoid generation was relatively low efficiency. We now report an optimized protocol for the efficient generation of large quantities of high-fidelity human blastoids from naive pluripotent stem cells. This enabled proteomics analysis that identified phosphosite-specific signatures potentially involved in the derivation and/or maintenance of the signaling states in human blastoids. Additionally, we uncovered endometrial stromal effects in promoting trophoblast cell survival, proliferation, and syncytialization during co-culture with blastoids and blastocysts. Side-by-side single-cell RNA sequencing revealed similarities and differences in transcriptome profiles between pre-implantation blastoids and blastocysts, as well as post-implantation cultures, and uncovered a population resembling early migratory trophoblasts during co-culture with endometrial stromal cells. Our optimized protocol will facilitate broader use of human blastoids as an accessible, perturbable, scalable, and tractable model for human blastocysts.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocytes, the major metabolic hub of the body, execute functions that are human-specific, altered in human disease, and currently thought to be regulated through endocrine and cell-autonomous mechanisms. Here, we show that key metabolic functions of human hepatocytes are controlled by non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) in their microenvironment. We developed mice bearing human hepatic tissue composed of human hepatocytes and NPCs, including human immune, endothelial, and stellate cells. Humanized livers reproduce human liver architecture, perform vital human-specific metabolic/homeostatic processes, and model human pathologies, including fibrosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Leveraging species mismatch and lipidomics, we demonstrate that human NPCs control metabolic functions of human hepatocytes in a paracrine manner. Mechanistically, we uncover a species-specific interaction whereby WNT2 secreted by sinusoidal endothelial cells controls cholesterol uptake and bile acid conjugation in hepatocytes through receptor FZD5. These results reveal the essential microenvironmental regulation of hepatic metabolism and its human-specific aspects.

Abstract: Summary
Terrestrial organisms developed circadian rhythms for adaptation to Earth’s quasi-24-h rotation. Achieving precise rhythms requires diurnal oscillation of fundamental biological processes, such as rhythmic shifts in the cellular translational landscape; however, regulatory mechanisms underlying rhythmic translation remain elusive. Here, we identified mammalian ATXN2 and ATXN2L as cooperating master regulators of rhythmic translation, through oscillating phase separation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus along circadian cycles. The spatiotemporal oscillating condensates facilitate sequential initiation of multiple cycling processes, from mRNA processing to protein translation, for selective genes including core clock genes. Depleting ATXN2 or 2L induces opposite alterations to the circadian period, whereas the absence of both disrupts translational activation cycles and weakens circadian rhythmicity in mice. Such cellular defect can be rescued by wild type, but not phase-separation-defective ATXN2. Together, we revealed that oscillating translation is regulated by spatiotemporal condensation of two master regulators to achieve precise circadian rhythm in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
In poikilotherms, temperature changes challenge the integration of physiological function. Within the complex nervous systems of the behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, these problems are substantial. RNA editing by adenosine deamination is a well-positioned mechanism for environmental acclimation. We report that the neural proteome of Octopus bimaculoides undergoes massive reconfigurations via RNA editing following a temperature challenge. Over 13,000 codons are affected, and many alter proteins that are vital for neural processes. For two highly temperature-sensitive examples, recoding tunes protein function. For synaptotagmin, a key component of Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release, crystal structures and supporting experiments show that editing alters Ca2+ binding. For kinesin-1, a motor protein driving axonal transport, editing regulates transport velocity down microtubules. Seasonal sampling of wild-caught specimens indicates that temperature-dependent editing occurs in the field as well. These data show that A-to-I editing tunes neurophysiological function in response to temperature in octopus and most likely other coleoids.

Abstract: Summary
Readthrough into the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of the mRNA results in the production of aberrant proteins. Metazoans efficiently clear readthrough proteins, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells that readthrough proteins are targeted by a coupled, two-level quality control pathway involving the BAG6 chaperone complex and the ribosome-collision-sensing protein GCN1. Readthrough proteins with hydrophobic C-terminal extensions (CTEs) are recognized by SGTA-BAG6 and ubiquitylated by RNF126 for proteasomal degradation. Additionally, cotranslational mRNA decay initiated by GCN1 and CCR4/NOT limits the accumulation of readthrough products. Unexpectedly, selective ribosome profiling uncovered a general role of GCN1 in regulating translation dynamics when ribosomes collide at nonoptimal codons, enriched in 3′ UTRs, transmembrane proteins, and collagens. GCN1 dysfunction increasingly perturbs these protein classes during aging, resulting in mRNA and proteome imbalance. Our results define GCN1 as a key factor acting during translation in maintaining protein homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is the key risk factor for cognitive decline, yet the molecular changes underlying brain aging remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted spatiotemporal RNA sequencing of the mouse brain, profiling 1,076 samples from 15 regions across 7 ages and 2 rejuvenation interventions. Our analysis identified a brain-wide gene signature of aging in glial cells, which exhibited spatially defined changes in magnitude. By integrating spatial and single-nucleus transcriptomics, we found that glial aging was particularly accelerated in white matter compared with cortical regions, whereas specialized neuronal populations showed region-specific expression changes. Rejuvenation interventions, including young plasma injection and dietary restriction, exhibited distinct effects on gene expression in specific brain regions. Furthermore, we discovered differential gene expression patterns associated with three human neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the importance of regional aging as a potential modulator of disease. Our findings identify molecular foci of brain aging, providing a foundation to target age-related cognitive decline.

Abstract: Summary
To improve the understanding of chemo-refractory high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs), we characterized the proteogenomic landscape of 242 (refractory and sensitive) HGSOCs, representing one discovery and two validation cohorts across two biospecimen types (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded and frozen). We identified a 64-protein signature that predicts with high specificity a subset of HGSOCs refractory to initial platinum-based therapy and is validated in two independent patient cohorts. We detected significant association between lack of Ch17 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and chemo-refractoriness. Based on pathway protein expression, we identified 5 clusters of HGSOC, which validated across two independent patient cohorts and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. These clusters may represent different mechanisms of refractoriness and implicate putative therapeutic vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Summary
Selective clearance of organelles, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, by autophagy plays an important role in cell health. Here, we describe a developmentally programmed selective ER clearance by autophagy. We show that Parkinson’s disease-associated PINK1, as well as Atl, Rtnl1, and Trp1 receptors, regulate ER clearance by autophagy. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin functions downstream of PINK1 and is required for mitochondrial clearance while having the opposite function in ER clearance. By contrast, Keap1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin3 function downstream of PINK1 to regulate ER clearance by influencing Rtnl1 and Atl. PINK1 regulates a change in Keap1 localization and Keap1-dependent ubiquitylation of the ER-phagy receptor Rtnl1 to facilitate ER clearance. Thus, PINK1 regulates the selective clearance of ER and mitochondria by influencing the balance of Keap1- and Parkin-dependent ubiquitylation of substrates that determine which organelle is removed by autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in an animal’s behavior and internal state are accompanied by widespread changes in activity across its brain. However, how neurons across the brain encode behavior and how this is impacted by state is poorly understood. We recorded brain-wide activity and the diverse motor programs of freely moving C. elegans and built probabilistic models that explain how each neuron encodes quantitative behavioral features. By determining the identities of the recorded neurons, we created an atlas of how the defined neuron classes in the C. elegans connectome encode behavior. Many neuron classes have conjunctive representations of multiple behaviors. Moreover, although many neurons encode current motor actions, others integrate recent actions. Changes in behavioral state are accompanied by widespread changes in how neurons encode behavior, and we identify these flexible nodes in the connectome. Our results provide a global map of how the cell types across an animal’s brain encode its behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Altered microglial states affect neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and disease but remain poorly understood. Here, we report 194,000 single-nucleus microglial transcriptomes and epigenomes across 443 human subjects and diverse Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathological phenotypes. We annotate 12 microglial transcriptional states, including AD-dysregulated homeostatic, inflammatory, and lipid-processing states. We identify 1,542 AD-differentially-expressed genes, including both microglia-state-specific and disease-stage-specific alterations. By integrating epigenomic, transcriptomic, and motif information, we infer upstream regulators of microglial cell states, gene-regulatory networks, enhancer-gene links, and transcription-factor-driven microglial state transitions. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of our predicted homeostatic-state activators induces homeostatic features in human iPSC-derived microglia-like cells, while inhibiting activators of inflammation can block inflammatory progression. Lastly, we pinpoint the expression of AD-risk genes in microglial states and differential expression of AD-risk genes and their regulators during AD progression. Overall, we provide insights underlying microglial states, including state-specific and AD-stage-specific microglial alterations at unprecedented resolution.

Abstract: Summary
The T cells of the immune system can target tumors and clear solid cancers following tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy. We used combinatorial peptide libraries and a proteomic database to reveal the antigen specificities of persistent cancer-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) following successful TIL therapy for stage IV malignant melanoma. Remarkably, individual TCRs could target multiple different tumor types via the HLA A∗02:01-restricted epitopes EAAGIGILTV, LLLGIGILVL, and NLSALGIFST from Melan A, BST2, and IMP2, respectively. Atomic structures of a TCR bound to all three antigens revealed the importance of the shared x-x-x-A/G-I/L-G-I-x-x-x recognition motif. Multi-epitope targeting allows individual T cells to attack cancer in several ways simultaneously. Such “multipronged” T cells exhibited superior recognition of cancer cells compared with conventional T cell recognition of individual epitopes, making them attractive candidates for the development of future immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Previous studies have identified topologically associating domains (TADs) as basic units of genome organization. We present evidence of a previously unreported level of genome folding, where distant TAD pairs, megabases apart, interact to form meta-domains. Within meta-domains, gene promoters and structural intergenic elements present in distant TADs are specifically paired. The associated genes encode neuronal determinants, including those engaged in axonal guidance and adhesion. These long-range associations occur in a large fraction of neurons but support transcription in only a subset of neurons. Meta-domains are formed by diverse transcription factors that are able to pair over long and flexible distances. We present evidence that two such factors, GAF and CTCF, play direct roles in this process. The relative simplicity of higher-order meta-domain interactions in Drosophila, compared with those previously described in mammals, allowed the demonstration that genomes can fold into highly specialized cell-type-specific scaffolds that enable megabase-scale regulatory associations.

Abstract: Summary
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play key roles in regulating cell signaling and physiology in both normal and cancer cells. Advances in mass spectrometry enable high-throughput, accurate, and sensitive measurement of PTM levels to better understand their role, prevalence, and crosstalk. Here, we analyze the largest collection of proteogenomics data from 1,110 patients with PTM profiles across 11 cancer types (10 from the National Cancer Institute’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium [CPTAC]). Our study reveals pan-cancer patterns of changes in protein acetylation and phosphorylation involved in hallmark cancer processes. These patterns revealed subsets of tumors, from different cancer types, including those with dysregulated DNA repair driven by phosphorylation, altered metabolic regulation associated with immune response driven by acetylation, affected kinase specificity by crosstalk between acetylation and phosphorylation, and modified histone regulation. Overall, this resource highlights the rich biology governed by PTMs and exposes potential new therapeutic avenues.

Abstract: Summary
Durable reconstitution of the distal lung epithelium with pluripotent stem cell (PSC) derivatives, if realized, would represent a promising therapy for diseases that result from alveolar damage. Here, we differentiate murine PSCs into self-renewing lung epithelial progenitors able to engraft into the injured distal lung epithelium of immunocompetent, syngeneic mouse recipients. After transplantation, these progenitors mature in the distal lung, assuming the molecular phenotypes of alveolar type 2 (AT2) and type 1 (AT1) cells. After months in vivo, donor-derived cells retain their mature phenotypes, as characterized by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), histologic profiling, and functional assessment that demonstrates continued capacity of the engrafted cells to proliferate and differentiate. These results indicate durable reconstitution of the distal lung’s facultative progenitor and differentiated epithelial cell compartments with PSC-derived cells, thus establishing a novel model for pulmonary cell therapy that can be utilized to better understand the mechanisms and utility of engraftment.

Abstract: Summary
RNA editing is a widespread epigenetic process that can alter the amino acid sequence of proteins, termed “recoding.” In cephalopods, most transcripts are recoded, and recoding is hypothesized to be an adaptive strategy to generate phenotypic plasticity. However, how animals use RNA recoding dynamically is largely unexplored. We investigated the function of cephalopod RNA recoding in the microtubule motor proteins kinesin and dynein. We found that squid rapidly employ RNA recoding in response to changes in ocean temperature, and kinesin variants generated in cold seawater displayed enhanced motile properties in single-molecule experiments conducted in the cold. We also identified tissue-specific recoded squid kinesin variants that displayed distinct motile properties. Finally, we showed that cephalopod recoding sites can guide the discovery of functional substitutions in non-cephalopod kinesin and dynein. Thus, RNA recoding is a dynamic mechanism that generates phenotypic plasticity in cephalopods and can inform the characterization of conserved non-cephalopod proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Sperm motility is crucial to reproductive success in sexually reproducing organisms. Impaired sperm movement causes male infertility, which is increasing globally. Sperm are powered by a microtubule-based molecular machine—the axoneme—but it is unclear how axonemal microtubules are ornamented to support motility in diverse fertilization environments. Here, we present high-resolution structures of native axonemal doublet microtubules (DMTs) from sea urchin and bovine sperm, representing external and internal fertilizers. We identify >60 proteins decorating sperm DMTs; at least 15 are sperm associated and 16 are linked to infertility. By comparing DMTs across species and cell types, we define core microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) and analyze evolution of the tektin bundle. We identify conserved axonemal microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) with unique tubulin-binding modes. Additionally, we identify a testis-specific serine/threonine kinase that links DMTs to outer dense fibers in mammalian sperm. Our study provides structural foundations for understanding sperm evolution, motility, and dysfunction at a molecular level.

Abstract: Summary
The gastrointestinal tract is in a state of constant motion. These movements are tightly regulated by the presence of food and help digestion by mechanically breaking down and propelling gut content. Mechanical sensing in the gut is thought to be essential for regulating motility; however, the identity of the neuronal populations, the molecules involved, and the functional consequences of this sensation are unknown. Here, we show that humans lacking PIEZO2 exhibit impaired bowel sensation and motility. Piezo2 in mouse dorsal root, but not nodose ganglia is required to sense gut content, and this activity slows down food transit rates in the stomach, small intestine, and colon. Indeed, Piezo2 is directly required to detect colon distension in vivo. Our study unveils the mechanosensory mechanisms that regulate the transit of luminal contents throughout the gut, which is a critical process to ensure proper digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste removal.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 is associated with broad tissue tropism, a characteristic often determined by the availability of entry receptors on host cells. Here, we show that TMEM106B, a lysosomal transmembrane protein, can serve as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-negative cells. Spike substitution E484D increased TMEM106B binding, thereby enhancing TMEM106B-mediated entry. TMEM106B-specific monoclonal antibodies blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection, demonstrating a role of TMEM106B in viral entry. Using X-ray crystallography, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we show that the luminal domain (LD) of TMEM106B engages the receptor-binding motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike. Finally, we show that TMEM106B promotes spike-mediated syncytium formation, suggesting a role of TMEM106B in viral fusion. Together, our findings identify an ACE2-independent SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism that involves cooperative interactions with the receptors heparan sulfate and TMEM106B.

Abstract: Summary
The bone marrow in the skull is important for shaping immune responses in the brain and meninges, but its molecular makeup among bones and relevance in human diseases remain unclear. Here, we show that the mouse skull has the most distinct transcriptomic profile compared with other bones in states of health and injury, characterized by a late-stage neutrophil phenotype. In humans, proteome analysis reveals that the skull marrow is the most distinct, with differentially expressed neutrophil-related pathways and a unique synaptic protein signature. 3D imaging demonstrates the structural and cellular details of human skull-meninges connections (SMCs) compared with veins. Last, using translocator protein positron emission tomography (TSPO-PET) imaging, we show that the skull bone marrow reflects inflammatory brain responses with a disease-specific spatial distribution in patients with various neurological disorders. The unique molecular profile and anatomical and functional connections of the skull show its potential as a site for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating brain diseases.

Abstract: Summary
KCR channelrhodopsins (K+-selective light-gated ion channels) have received attention as potential inhibitory optogenetic tools but more broadly pose a fundamental mystery regarding how their K+ selectivity is achieved. Here, we present 2.5–2.7 Å cryo-electron microscopy structures of HcKCR1 and HcKCR2 and of a structure-guided mutant with enhanced K+ selectivity. Structural, electrophysiological, computational, spectroscopic, and biochemical analyses reveal a distinctive mechanism for K+ selectivity; rather than forming the symmetrical filter of canonical K+ channels achieving both selectivity and dehydration, instead, three extracellular-vestibule residues within each monomer form a flexible asymmetric selectivity gate, while a distinct dehydration pathway extends intracellularly. Structural comparisons reveal a retinal-binding pocket that induces retinal rotation (accounting for HcKCR1/HcKCR2 spectral differences), and design of corresponding KCR variants with increased K+ selectivity (KALI-1/KALI-2) provides key advantages for optogenetic inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Thus, discovery of a mechanism for ion-channel K+ selectivity also provides a framework for next-generation optogenetics.

Abstract: Summary
Hybrid sterility restricts the utilization of superior heterosis of indica-japonica inter-subspecific hybrids. In this study, we report the identification of RHS12, a major locus controlling male gamete sterility in indica-japonica hybrid rice. We show that RHS12 consists of two genes (iORF3/DUYAO and iORF4/JIEYAO) that confer preferential transmission of the RHS12-i type male gamete into the progeny, thereby forming a natural gene drive. DUYAO encodes a mitochondrion-targeted protein that interacts with OsCOX11 to trigger cytotoxicity and cell death, whereas JIEYAO encodes a protein that reroutes DUYAO to the autophagosome for degradation via direct physical interaction, thereby detoxifying DUYAO. Evolutionary trajectory analysis reveals that this system likely formed de novo in the AA genome Oryza clade and contributed to reproductive isolation (RI) between different lineages of rice. Our combined results provide mechanistic insights into the genetic basis of RI as well as insights for strategic designs of hybrid rice breeding.

Abstract: Summary
Synucleinopathies are characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregates in the brain. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of synucleinopathies requires radiopharmaceuticals that selectively bind α-Syn deposits. We report the identification of a brain permeable and rapid washout PET tracer [18F]-F0502B, which shows high binding affinity for α-Syn, but not for Aβ or Tau fibrils, and preferential binding to α-Syn aggregates in the brain sections. Employing several cycles of counter screenings with in vitro fibrils, intraneuronal aggregates, and neurodegenerative disease brain sections from several mice models and human subjects, [18F]-F0502B images α-Syn deposits in the brains of mouse and non-human primate PD models. We further determined the atomic structure of the α-Syn fibril-F0502B complex by cryo-EM and revealed parallel diagonal stacking of F0502B on the fibril surface through an intense noncovalent bonding network via inter-ligand interactions. Therefore, [18F]-F0502B is a promising lead compound for imaging aggregated α-Syn in synucleinopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic mutations commonly occur in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Some mutant clones outgrow through clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and produce mutated immune progenies shaping host immunity. Individuals with CH are asymptomatic but have an increased risk of developing leukemia, cardiovascular and pulmonary inflammatory diseases, and severe infections. Using genetic engineering of human HSCs (hHSCs) and transplantation in immunodeficient mice, we describe how a commonly mutated gene in CH, TET2, affects human neutrophil development and function. TET2 loss in hHSCs produce a distinct neutrophil heterogeneity in bone marrow and peripheral tissues by increasing the repopulating capacity of neutrophil progenitors and giving rise to low-granule neutrophils. Human neutrophils that inherited TET2 mutations mount exacerbated inflammatory responses and have more condensed chromatin, which correlates with compact neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) production. We expose here physiological abnormalities that may inform future strategies to detect TET2-CH and prevent NET-mediated pathologies associated with CH.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer is characterized by hypomethylation-associated silencing of large chromatin domains, whose contribution to tumorigenesis is uncertain. Through high-resolution genome-wide single-cell DNA methylation sequencing, we identify 40 core domains that are uniformly hypomethylated from the earliest detectable stages of prostate malignancy through metastatic circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Nested among these repressive domains are smaller loci with preserved methylation that escape silencing and are enriched for cell proliferation genes. Transcriptionally silenced genes within the core hypomethylated domains are enriched for immune-related genes; prominent among these is a single gene cluster harboring all five CD1 genes that present lipid antigens to NKT cells and four IFI16-related interferon-inducible genes implicated in innate immunity. The re-expression of CD1 or IFI16 murine orthologs in immuno-competent mice abrogates tumorigenesis, accompanied by the activation of anti-tumor immunity. Thus, early epigenetic changes may shape tumorigenesis, targeting co-located genes within defined chromosomal loci. Hypomethylation domains are detectable in blood specimens enriched for CTCs.

Abstract: Summary
White matter injuries (WMIs) are the leading cause of neurologic impairment in infants born premature. There are no treatment options available. The most common forms of WMIs in infants occur prior to the onset of normal myelination, making its pathophysiology distinctive, thus requiring a tailored approach to treatment. Neonates present a unique opportunity to repair WMIs due to a transient abundance of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) present in the germinal matrix with oligodendrogenic potential. We identified an endogenous oxysterol, 20-αHydroxycholesterol (20HC), in human maternal breast milk that induces oligodendrogenesis through a sonic hedgehog (shh), Gli-dependent mechanism. Following WMI in neonatal mice, injection of 20HC induced subventricular zone-derived oligodendrogenesis and improved myelination in the periventricular white matter, resulting in improved motor outcomes. Targeting the oligodendrogenic potential of postnatal NSPCs in neonates with WMIs may be further developed into a novel approach to mitigate this devastating complication of preterm birth.

Abstract: Summary
H3N8 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in China caused two confirmed human infections in 2022, followed by a fatal case reported in 2023. H3N8 viruses are widespread in chicken flocks; however, the zoonotic features of H3N8 viruses are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that H3N8 viruses were able to infect and replicate efficiently in organotypic normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and lung epithelial (Calu-3) cells. Human isolates of H3N8 virus were more virulent and caused severe pathology in mice and ferrets, relative to chicken isolates. Importantly, H3N8 virus isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia was transmissible between ferrets through respiratory droplets; it had acquired human-receptor-binding preference and amino acid substitution PB2-E627K necessary for airborne transmission. Human populations, even when vaccinated against human H3N2 virus, appear immunologically naive to emerging mammalian-adapted H3N8 AIVs and could be vulnerable to infection at epidemic or pandemic proportion.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro stem cell models that replicate human gastrulation have been generated, but they lack the essential extraembryonic cells needed for embryonic development, morphogenesis, and patterning. Here, we describe a robust and efficient method that prompts human extended pluripotent stem cells to self-organize into embryo-like structures, termed peri-gastruloids, which encompass both embryonic (epiblast) and extraembryonic (hypoblast) tissues. Although peri-gastruloids are not viable due to the exclusion of trophoblasts, they recapitulate critical stages of human peri-gastrulation development, such as forming amniotic and yolk sac cavities, developing bilaminar and trilaminar embryonic discs, specifying primordial germ cells, initiating gastrulation, and undergoing early neurulation and organogenesis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing unveiled transcriptomic similarities between advanced human peri-gastruloids and primary peri-gastrulation cell types found in humans and non-human primates. This peri-gastruloid platform allows for further exploration beyond gastrulation and may potentially aid in the development of human fetal tissues for use in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome modulates immune and metabolic health. Human microbiome data are biased toward industrialized populations, limiting our understanding of non-industrialized microbiomes. Here, we performed ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing on 351 fecal samples from the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania and comparative populations in Nepal and California. We recovered 91,662 genomes of bacteria, archaea, bacteriophages, and eukaryotes, 44% of which are absent from existing unified datasets. We identified 124 gut-resident species vanishing in industrialized populations and highlighted distinct aspects of the Hadza gut microbiome related to in situ replication rates, signatures of selection, and strain sharing. Industrialized gut microbes were found to be enriched in genes associated with oxidative stress, possibly a result of microbiome adaptation to inflammatory processes. This unparalleled view of the Hadza gut microbiome provides a valuable resource, expands our understanding of microbes capable of colonizing the human gut, and clarifies the extensive perturbation induced by the industrialized lifestyle.

Abstract: Summary
Lifespan varies within and across species, but the general principles of its control remain unclear. Here, we conducted multi-tissue RNA-seq analyses across 41 mammalian species, identifying longevity signatures and examining their relationship with transcriptomic biomarkers of aging and established lifespan-extending interventions. An integrative analysis uncovered shared longevity mechanisms within and across species, including downregulated Igf1 and upregulated mitochondrial translation genes, and unique features, such as distinct regulation of the innate immune response and cellular respiration. Signatures of long-lived species were positively correlated with age-related changes and enriched for evolutionarily ancient essential genes, involved in proteolysis and PI3K-Akt signaling. Conversely, lifespan-extending interventions counteracted aging patterns and affected younger, mutable genes enriched for energy metabolism. The identified biomarkers revealed longevity interventions, including KU0063794, which extended mouse lifespan and healthspan. Overall, this study uncovers universal and distinct strategies of lifespan regulation within and across species and provides tools for discovering longevity interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane tension is thought to be a long-range integrator of cell physiology. Membrane tension has been proposed to enable cell polarity during migration through front-back coordination and long-range protrusion competition. These roles necessitate effective tension transmission across the cell. However, conflicting observations have left the field divided as to whether cell membranes support or resist tension propagation. This discrepancy likely originates from the use of exogenous forces that may not accurately mimic endogenous forces. We overcome this complication by leveraging optogenetics to directly control localized actin-based protrusions or actomyosin contractions while simultaneously monitoring the propagation of membrane tension using dual-trap optical tweezers. Surprisingly, actin-driven protrusions and actomyosin contractions both elicit rapid global membrane tension propagation, whereas forces applied to cell membranes alone do not. We present a simple unifying mechanical model in which mechanical forces that engage the actin cortex drive rapid, robust membrane tension propagation through long-range membrane flows.

Abstract: Summary
Many regions in the human genome vary in length among individuals due to variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTRs). To assess the phenotypic impact of VNTRs genome-wide, we applied a statistical imputation approach to estimate the lengths of 9,561 autosomal VNTR loci in 418,136 unrelated UK Biobank participants and 838 GTEx participants. Association and statistical fine-mapping analyses identified 58 VNTRs that appeared to influence a complex trait in UK Biobank, 18 of which also appeared to modulate expression or splicing of a nearby gene. Non-coding VNTRs at TMCO1 and EIF3H appeared to generate the largest known contributions of common human genetic variation to risk of glaucoma and colorectal cancer, respectively. Each of these two VNTRs associated with a >2-fold range of risk across individuals. These results reveal a substantial and previously unappreciated role of non-coding VNTRs in human health and gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Many sequence variants have additive effects on blood lipid levels and, through that, on the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). We show that variants also have non-additive effects and interact to affect lipid levels as well as affecting variance and correlations. Variance and correlation effects are often signatures of epistasis or gene-environmental interactions. These complex effects can translate into CAD risk. For example, Trp154Ter in FUT2 protects against CAD among subjects with the A1 blood group, whereas it associates with greater risk of CAD in others. His48Arg in ADH1B interacts with alcohol consumption to affect lipid levels and CAD. The effect of variants in TM6SF2 on blood lipids is greatest among those who never eat oily fish but absent from those who often do. This work demonstrates that variants that affect variance of quantitative traits can allow for the discovery of epistasis and interactions of variants with the environment.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we reveal an unanticipated role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in regulating complex social behavior in ants. Using scRNA-seq, we find localization in the BBB of a key hormone-degrading enzyme called juvenile hormone esterase (Jhe), and we show that this localization governs the level of juvenile hormone (JH3) entering the brain. Manipulation of the Jhe level reprograms the brain transcriptome between ant castes. Although ant Jhe is retained and functions intracellularly within the BBB, we show that Drosophila Jhe is naturally extracellular. Heterologous expression of ant Jhe into the Drosophila BBB alters behavior in fly to mimic what is seen in ants. Most strikingly, manipulation of Jhe levels in ants reprograms complex behavior between worker castes. Our study thus uncovers a remarkable, potentially conserved role of the BBB serving as a molecular gatekeeper for a neurohormonal pathway that regulates social behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells represent an abundant innate-like T cell subtype in the human liver. MAIT cells are assigned crucial roles in regulating immunity and inflammation, yet their role in liver cancer remains elusive. Here, we present a MAIT cell-centered profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using scRNA-seq, flow cytometry, and co-detection by indexing (CODEX) imaging of paired patient samples. These analyses highlight the heterogeneity and dysfunctionality of MAIT cells in HCC and their defective capacity to infiltrate liver tumors. Machine-learning tools were used to dissect the spatial cellular interaction network within the MAIT cell neighborhood. Co-localization in the adjacent liver and interaction between niche-occupying CSF1R+PD-L1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and MAIT cells was identified as a key regulatory element of MAIT cell dysfunction. Perturbation of this cell-cell interaction in ex vivo co-culture studies using patient samples and murine models reinvigorated MAIT cell cytotoxicity. These studies suggest that aPD-1/aPD-L1 therapies target MAIT cells in HCC patients.

Abstract: Summary
A system for programmable export of RNA molecules from living cells would enable both non-destructive monitoring of cell dynamics and engineering of cells capable of delivering executable RNA programs to other cells. We developed genetically encoded cellular RNA exporters, inspired by viruses, that efficiently package and secrete cargo RNA molecules from mammalian cells within protective nanoparticles. Exporting and sequencing RNA barcodes enabled non-destructive monitoring of cell population dynamics with clonal resolution. Further, by incorporating fusogens into the nanoparticles, we demonstrated the delivery, expression, and functional activity of exported mRNA in recipient cells. We term these systems COURIER (controlled output and uptake of RNA for interrogation, expression, and regulation). COURIER enables measurement of cell dynamics and establishes a foundation for hybrid cell and gene therapies based on cell-to-cell delivery of RNA.

Abstract: Summary
Cells contain numerous abundant molecular machines assembled from multiple subunits. Imbalances in subunit production and failed assembly generate orphan subunits that are eliminated by poorly defined pathways. Here, we determined how orphan subunits of the cytosolic chaperonin CCT are recognized. Several unassembled CCT subunits recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2 using ZNRD2 as an adaptor. Both factors were necessary for orphan CCT subunit degradation in cells, sufficient for CCT subunit ubiquitination with purified factors, and necessary for optimal cell fitness. Domain mapping and structure prediction defined the molecular features of a minimal HERC2-ZNRD2-CCT module. The structural model, whose key elements were validated in cells using point mutants, shows why ZNRD2 selectively recognizes multiple orphaned CCT subunits without engaging assembled CCT. Our findings reveal how failures during CCT assembly are monitored and provide a paradigm for the molecular recognition of orphan subunits, the largest source of quality control substrates in cells.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy effectively treats human cancer, but the loss of the antigen recognized by the CAR poses a major obstacle. We found that in vivo vaccine boosting of CAR T cells triggers the engagement of the endogenous immune system to circumvent antigen-negative tumor escape. Vaccine-boosted CAR T promoted dendritic cell (DC) recruitment to tumors, increased tumor antigen uptake by DCs, and elicited the priming of endogenous anti-tumor T cells. This process was accompanied by shifts in CAR T metabolism toward oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and was critically dependent on CAR-T-derived IFN-γ. Antigen spreading (AS) induced by vaccine-boosted CAR T enabled a proportion of complete responses even when the initial tumor was 50% CAR antigen negative, and heterogeneous tumor control was further enhanced by the genetic amplification of CAR T IFN-γ expression. Thus, CAR-T-cell-derived IFN-γ plays a critical role in promoting AS, and vaccine boosting provides a clinically translatable strategy to drive such responses against solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical forces are known to be important in mammalian blastocyst formation; however, due to limited tools, specific force inputs and how they relay to first cell fate control of inner cell mass (ICM) and/or trophectoderm (TE) remain elusive. Combining in toto live imaging and various perturbation experiments, we demonstrate and measure fluid flow forces existing in the mouse blastocyst cavity and identify Klf2(Krüppel-like factor 2) as a fluid force reporter with force-responsive enhancers. Long-term live imaging and lineage reconstructions reveal that blastomeres subject to higher fluid flow forces adopt ICM cell fates. These are reinforced by internal ferrofluid-induced flow force assays. We also utilize ex vivo fluid flow force mimicking and pharmacological perturbations to confirm mechanosensing specificity. Together, we report a genetically encoded reporter for continuously monitoring fluid flow forces and cell fate decisions and provide a live imaging framework to infer force information enriched lineage landscape during development.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer driver events refer to key genetic aberrations that drive oncogenesis; however, their exact molecular mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Here, our multi-omics pan-cancer analysis uncovers insights into the impacts of cancer drivers by identifying their significant cis-effects and distal trans-effects quantified at the RNA, protein, and phosphoprotein levels. Salient observations include the association of point mutations and copy-number alterations with the rewiring of protein interaction networks, and notably, most cancer genes converge toward similar molecular states denoted by sequence-based kinase activity profiles. A correlation between predicted neoantigen burden and measured T cell infiltration suggests potential vulnerabilities for immunotherapies. Patterns of cancer hallmarks vary by polygenic protein abundance ranging from uniform to heterogeneous. Overall, our work demonstrates the value of comprehensive proteogenomics in understanding the functional states of oncogenic drivers and their links to cancer development, surpassing the limitations of studying individual cancer types.

Abstract: Summary
Remodeling of the tissue niche is often evident in diseases, yet, the stromal alterations and their contribution to pathogenesis are poorly characterized. Bone marrow fibrosis is a maladaptive feature of primary myelofibrosis (PMF). We performed lineage tracing and found that most collagen-expressing myofibroblasts were derived from leptin-receptor-positive (LepR+) mesenchymal cells, whereas a minority were from Gli1-lineage cells. Deletion of Gli1 did not impact PMF. Unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) confirmed that virtually all myofibroblasts originated from LepR-lineage cells, with reduced expression of hematopoietic niche factors and increased expression of fibrogenic factors. Concurrently, endothelial cells upregulated arteriolar-signature genes. Pericytes and Sox10+ glial cells expanded drastically with heightened cell-cell signaling, suggesting important functional roles in PMF. Chemical or genetic ablation of bone marrow glial cells ameliorated fibrosis and improved other pathology in PMF. Thus, PMF involves complex remodeling of the bone marrow microenvironment, and glial cells represent a promising therapeutic target.

Upon binding DNA, cGAS synthesizes a nucleotide signal 2′3′-cGAMP that activates STING-dependent downstream immunity. Here, we discover that cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) constitute a major family of pattern recognition receptors in innate immunity. Building on recent analysis in Drosophila, we identify >3,000 cGLRs present in nearly all metazoan phyla. A forward biochemical screening of 150 animal cGLRs reveals a conserved mechanism of signaling including response to dsDNA and dsRNA ligands and synthesis of isomers of the nucleotide signals cGAMP, c-UMP-AMP, and c-di-AMP. Combining structural biology and in vivo analysis in coral and oyster animals, we explain how synthesis of distinct nucleotide signals enables cells to control discrete cGLR-STING signaling pathways. Our results reveal cGLRs as a widespread family of pattern recognition receptors and establish molecular rules that govern nucleotide signaling in animal immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired differentiation of alveolar stem cells has been identified in a variety of acute and chronic lung diseases. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms that modulate alveolar regeneration and understand how aging impacts this process. We have discovered that the process of alveolar type II (AT2) cells differentiating into AT1 cells is an energetically costly process. During alveolar regeneration, activated AMPK-PFKFB2 signaling upregulates glycolysis, which is essential to support the intracellular energy expenditure that is required for cytoskeletal remodeling during AT2 cell differentiation. AT2 cells in aged lungs exhibit reduced AMPK-PFKFB2 signaling and ATP production, resulting in impaired alveolar regeneration. Activating AMPK-PFKFB2 signaling in aged AT2 cells can rescue defective alveolar regeneration in aged mice. Thus, beyond demonstrating that cellular energy metabolism orchestrates with stem cell differentiation during alveolar regeneration, our study suggests that modulating AMPK-PFKFB2 signaling promotes alveolar repair in aged lungs.

Abstract: Summary
Life-long reconstitution of a tissue’s resident stem cell compartment with engrafted cells has the potential to durably replenish organ function. Here, we demonstrate the engraftment of the airway epithelial stem cell compartment via intra-airway transplantation of mouse or human primary and pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived airway basal cells (BCs). Murine primary or PSC-derived BCs transplanted into polidocanol-injured syngeneic recipients give rise for at least two years to progeny that stably display the morphologic, molecular, and functional phenotypes of airway epithelia. The engrafted basal-like cells retain extensive self-renewal potential, evident by the capacity to reconstitute the tracheal epithelium through seven generations of secondary transplantation. Using the same approach, human primary or PSC-derived BCs transplanted into NOD scid gamma (NSG) recipient mice similarly display multilineage airway epithelial differentiation in vivo. Our results may provide a step toward potential future syngeneic cell-based therapy for patients with diseases resulting from airway epithelial cell damage or dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification, routinely occurring at mRNA 5′ cap or within tRNAs/rRNAs, also exists internally in messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Although m7G-cap is essential for pre-mRNA processing and protein synthesis, the exact role of mRNA internal m7G modification remains elusive. Here, we report that mRNA internal m7G is selectively recognized by Quaking proteins (QKIs). By transcriptome-wide profiling/mapping of internal m7G methylome and QKI-binding sites, we identified more than 1,000 high-confidence m7G-modified and QKI-bound mRNA targets with a conserved “GANGAN (N = A/C/U/G)” motif. Strikingly, QKI7 interacts (via C terminus) with the stress granule (SG) core protein G3BP1 and shuttles internal m7G-modified transcripts into SGs to regulate mRNA stability and translation under stress conditions. Specifically, QKI7 attenuates the translation efficiency of essential genes in Hippo signaling pathways to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. Collectively, we characterized QKIs as mRNA internal m7G-binding proteins that modulate target mRNA metabolism and cellular drug resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis, a cell death process driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation, has been implicated in various diseases. There are two major surveillance mechanisms to suppress ferroptosis: one mediated by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) that catalyzes the reduction of phospholipid peroxides and the other mediated by enzymes, such as FSP1, that produce metabolites with free radical-trapping antioxidant activity. In this study, through a whole-genome CRISPR activation screen, followed by mechanistic investigation, we identified phospholipid-modifying enzymes MBOAT1 and MBOAT2 as ferroptosis suppressors. MBOAT1/2 inhibit ferroptosis by remodeling the cellular phospholipid profile, and strikingly, their ferroptosis surveillance function is independent of GPX4 or FSP1. MBOAT1 and MBOAT2 are transcriptionally upregulated by sex hormone receptors, i.e., estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR), respectively. A combination of ER or AR antagonist with ferroptosis induction significantly inhibited the growth of ER+ breast cancer and AR+ prostate cancer, even when tumors were resistant to single-agent hormonal therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The most extreme environments are the most vulnerable to transformation under a rapidly changing climate. These ecosystems harbor some of the most specialized species, which will likely suffer the highest extinction rates. We document the steepest temperature increase (2010–2021) on record at altitudes of above 4,000 m, triggering a decline of the relictual and highly adapted moss Takakia lepidozioides. Its de-novo-sequenced genome with 27,467 protein-coding genes includes distinct adaptations to abiotic stresses and comprises the largest number of fast-evolving genes under positive selection. The uplift of the study site in the last 65 million years has resulted in life-threatening UV-B radiation and drastically reduced temperatures, and we detected several of the molecular adaptations of Takakia to these environmental changes. Surprisingly, specific morphological features likely occurred earlier than 165 mya in much warmer environments. Following nearly 400 million years of evolution and resilience, this species is now facing extinction.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the cellular organization of the cerebral cortex is critical for understanding brain structure and function. Using large-scale single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analysis of 143 macaque cortical regions, we obtained a comprehensive atlas of 264 transcriptome-defined cortical cell types and mapped their spatial distribution across the entire cortex. We characterized the cortical layer and region preferences of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and non-neuronal cell types, as well as regional differences in cell-type composition and neighborhood complexity. Notably, we discovered a relationship between the regional distribution of various cell types and the region’s hierarchical level in the visual and somatosensory systems. Cross-species comparison of transcriptomic data from human, macaque, and mouse cortices further revealed primate-specific cell types that are enriched in layer 4, with their marker genes expressed in a region-dependent manner. Our data provide a cellular and molecular basis for understanding the evolution, development, aging, and pathogenesis of the primate brain.

Abstract: Summary
Gene editing using engineered nucleases frequently produces unintended genetic lesions in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Gene-edited HSC cultures thus contain heterogeneous populations, the majority of which either do not carry the desired edit or harbor unwanted mutations. In consequence, transplanting edited HSCs carries the risks of suboptimal efficiency and of unwanted mutations in the graft. Here, we present an approach for expanding gene-edited HSCs at clonal density, allowing for genetic profiling of individual clones before transplantation. We achieved this by developing a defined, polymer-based expansion system and identifying long-term expanding clones within the CD201+CD150+CD48−c-Kit+Sca-1+Lin− population of precultured HSCs. Using the Prkdcscid immunodeficiency model, we demonstrate that we can expand and profile edited HSC clones to check for desired and unintended modifications, including large deletions. Transplantation of Prkdc-corrected HSCs rescued the immunodeficient phenotype. Our ex vivo manipulation platform establishes a paradigm to control genetic heterogeneity in HSC gene editing and therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Injury induces systemic responses, but their functions remain elusive. Mechanisms that can rapidly synchronize wound responses through long distances are also mostly unknown. Using planarian flatworms capable of whole-body regeneration, we report that injury induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) activity waves to travel at a speed 10–100 times faster than those in other multicellular tissues. This ultrafast propagation requires longitudinal body-wall muscles, elongated cells forming dense parallel tracks running the length of the organism. The morphological properties of muscles allow them to act as superhighways for propagating and disseminating wound signals. Inhibiting Erk propagation prevents tissues distant to the wound from responding and blocks regeneration, which can be rescued by a second injury to distal tissues shortly after the first injury. Our findings provide a mechanism for long-range signal propagation in large, complex tissues to coordinate responses across cell types and highlight the function of feedback between spatially separated tissues during whole-body regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Proper preimplantation development is essential to assemble a blastocyst capable of implantation. Live imaging has uncovered major events driving early development in mouse embryos; yet, studies in humans have been limited by restrictions on genetic manipulation and lack of imaging approaches. We have overcome this barrier by combining fluorescent dyes with live imaging to reveal the dynamics of chromosome segregation, compaction, polarization, blastocyst formation, and hatching in the human embryo. We also show that blastocyst expansion mechanically constrains trophectoderm cells, causing nuclear budding and DNA shedding into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, cells with lower perinuclear keratin levels are more prone to undergo DNA loss. Moreover, applying trophectoderm biopsy, a mechanical procedure performed clinically for genetic testing, increases DNA shedding. Thus, our work reveals distinct processes underlying human development compared with mouse and suggests that aneuploidies in human embryos may not only originate from chromosome segregation errors during mitosis but also from nuclear DNA shedding.

Abstract: Summary
The properties of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons that innervate the distal colon are poorly defined, hindering our understanding of their roles in normal physiology and gastrointestinal (GI) disease. Here, we report genetically defined subsets of colon-innervating DRG neurons with diverse morphologic and physiologic properties. Four colon-innervating DRG neuron populations are mechanosensitive and exhibit distinct force thresholds to colon distension. The highest threshold population, selectively labeled using Bmpr1b genetic tools, is necessary and sufficient for behavioral responses to high colon distension, which is partly mediated by the mechanosensory ion channel Piezo2. This Aδ-HTMR population mediates behavioral over-reactivity to colon distension caused by inflammation in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, like cutaneous DRG mechanoreceptor populations, colon-innervating mechanoreceptors exhibit distinct anatomical and physiological properties and tile force threshold space, and genetically defined colon-innervating HTMRs mediate pathophysiological responses to colon distension, revealing a target population for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Electrically conductive appendages from the anaerobic bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens, recently identified as extracellular cytochrome nanowires (ECNs), have received wide attention due to numerous potential applications. However, whether other organisms employ similar ECNs for electron transfer remains unknown. Here, using cryoelectron microscopy, we describe the atomic structures of two ECNs from two major orders of hyperthermophilic archaea present in deep-sea hydrothermal vents and terrestrial hot springs. Homologs of Archaeoglobus veneficus ECN are widespread among mesophilic methane-oxidizing Methanoperedenaceae, alkane-degrading Syntrophoarchaeales archaea, and in the recently described megaplasmids called Borgs. The ECN protein subunits lack similarities in their folds; however, they share a common heme arrangement, suggesting an evolutionarily optimized heme packing for efficient electron transfer. The detection of ECNs in archaea suggests that filaments containing closely stacked hemes may be a common and widespread mechanism for long-range electron transfer in both prokaryotic domains of life.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the remarkable success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, most cancer patients still do not respond. We now find that immunotherapy can induce stem-like properties in tumors. Using mouse models of breast cancer, we observe that cancer stem cells (CSCs) show not only enhanced resistance to T cell cytotoxicity, but that interferon gamma (IFNγ) produced by activated T cells directly converts non-CSCs to CSCs. IFNγ enhances several CSC phenotypes, such as resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy and metastasis formation. We identified the branched-chain amino acid aminotransaminase 1 (BCAT1) as a downstream mediator of IFNγ-induced CSC plasticity. Targeting BCAT1 in vivo improved cancer vaccination and ICB therapy by preventing IFNγ-induced metastasis formation. Breast cancer patients treated with ICB exhibited a similar increase in CSC markers expression indicating comparable responses to immune activation in humans. Collectively, we discover an unexpected, pro-tumoral role for IFNγ that may contribute to cancer immunotherapy failure.

Abstract: Summary
The human body contains thousands of metabolites derived from mammalian cells, the microbiota, food, and medical drugs. Many bioactive metabolites act through the engagement of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); however, technological limitations constrain current explorations of metabolite-GPCR interactions. Here, we developed a highly multiplexed screening technology called PRESTO-Salsa that enables simultaneous assessment of nearly all conventional GPCRs (>300 receptors) in a single well of a 96-well plate. Using PRESTO-Salsa, we screened 1,041 human-associated metabolites against the GPCRome and uncovered previously unreported endogenous, exogenous, and microbial GPCR agonists. Next, we leveraged PRESTO-Salsa to generate an atlas of microbiome-GPCR interactions across 435 human microbiome strains from multiple body sites, revealing conserved patterns of cross-tissue GPCR engagement and activation of CD97/ADGRE5 by the Porphyromonas gingivalis protease gingipain K. These studies thus establish a highly multiplexed bioactivity screening technology and expose a diverse landscape of human, diet, drug, and microbiota metabolome-GPCRome interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Alphaviruses are RNA viruses that represent emerging public health threats. To identify protective antibodies, we immunized macaques with a mixture of western, eastern, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus-like particles (VLPs), a regimen that protects against aerosol challenge with all three viruses. Single- and triple-virus-specific antibodies were isolated, and we identified 21 unique binding groups. Cryo-EM structures revealed that broad VLP binding inversely correlated with sequence and conformational variability. One triple-specific antibody, SKT05, bound proximal to the fusion peptide and neutralized all three Env-pseudotyped encephalitic alphaviruses by using different symmetry elements for recognition across VLPs. Neutralization in other assays (e.g., chimeric Sindbis virus) yielded variable results. SKT05 bound backbone atoms of sequence-diverse residues, enabling broad recognition despite sequence variability; accordingly, SKT05 protected mice against Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, chikungunya virus, and Ross River virus challenges. Thus, a single vaccine-elicited antibody can protect in vivo against a broad range of alphaviruses.

Abstract: Summary
TET2 is recurrently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its deficiency promotes leukemogenesis (driven by aggressive oncogenic mutations) and enhances leukemia stem cell (LSC) self-renewal. However, the underlying cellular/molecular mechanisms have yet to be fully understood. Here, we show that Tet2 deficiency significantly facilitates leukemogenesis in various AML models (mediated by aggressive or less aggressive mutations) through promoting homing of LSCs into bone marrow (BM) niche to increase their self-renewal/proliferation. TET2 deficiency in AML blast cells increases expression of Tetraspanin 13 (TSPAN13) and thereby activates the CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling, leading to increased homing/migration of LSCs into BM niche. Mechanistically, TET2 deficiency results in the accumulation of methyl-5-cytosine (m5C) modification in TSPAN13 mRNA; YBX1 specifically recognizes the m5C modification and increases the stability and expression of TSPAN13 transcripts. Collectively, our studies reveal the functional importance of TET2 in leukemogenesis, leukemic blast cell migration/homing, and LSC self-renewal as an mRNA m5C demethylase.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular homeostasis requires the robust control of biomolecule concentrations, but how do millions of mRNAs coordinate their stoichiometries in the face of dynamic translational changes? Here, we identified a two-tiered mechanism controlling mRNA:mRNA and mRNA:protein stoichiometries where mRNAs super-assemble into condensates with buffering capacity and sorting selectivity through phase-transition mechanisms. Using C. elegans oogenesis arrest as a model, we investigated the transcriptome cytosolic reorganization through the sequencing of RNA super-assemblies coupled with single mRNA imaging. Tightly repressed mRNAs self-assembled into same-sequence nanoclusters that further co-assembled into multiphase condensates. mRNA self-sorting was concentration dependent, providing a self-buffering mechanism that is selective to sequence identity and controls mRNA:mRNA stoichiometries. The cooperative sharing of limiting translation repressors between clustered mRNAs prevented the disruption of mRNA:repressor stoichiometries in the cytosol. Robust control of mRNA:mRNA and mRNA:protein stoichiometries emerges from mRNA self-demixing and cooperative super-assembly into multiphase multiscale condensates with dynamic storage capacity.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic lesions that disrupt regulatory elements represent potential cancer drivers. However, we lack experimental models for validating their tumorigenic impact. Here, we model aberrations arising in isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant gliomas, which exhibit DNA hypermethylation. We focus on a CTCF insulator near the PDGFRA oncogene that is recurrently disrupted by methylation in these tumors. We demonstrate that disruption of the syntenic insulator in mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) allows an OPC-specific enhancer to contact and induce Pdgfra, thereby increasing proliferation. We show that a second lesion, methylation-dependent silencing of the Cdkn2a tumor suppressor, cooperates with insulator loss in OPCs. Coordinate inactivation of the Pdgfra insulator and Cdkn2a drives gliomagenesis in vivo. Despite locus synteny, the insulator is CpG-rich only in humans, a feature that may confer human glioma risk but complicates mouse modeling. Our study demonstrates the capacity of recurrent epigenetic lesions to drive OPC proliferation in vitro and gliomagenesis in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Prime editing enables a wide variety of precise genome edits in living cells. Here we use protein evolution and engineering to generate prime editors with reduced size and improved efficiency. Using phage-assisted evolution, we improved editing efficiencies of compact reverse transcriptases by up to 22-fold and generated prime editors that are 516–810 base pairs smaller than the current-generation editor PEmax. We discovered that different reverse transcriptases specialize in different types of edits and used this insight to generate reverse transcriptases that outperform PEmax and PEmaxΔRNaseH, the truncated editor used in dual-AAV delivery systems. Finally, we generated Cas9 domains that improve prime editing. These resulting editors (PE6a-g) enhance therapeutically relevant editing in patient-derived fibroblasts and primary human T-cells. PE6 variants also enable longer insertions to be installed in vivo following dual-AAV delivery, achieving 40% loxP insertion in the cortex of the murine brain, a 24-fold improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art prime editors.

Abstract: Summary
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a common precursor of invasive breast cancer. Our understanding of its genomic progression to recurrent disease remains poor, partly due to challenges associated with the genomic profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) materials. Here, we developed Arc-well, a high-throughput single-cell DNA-sequencing method that is compatible with FFPE materials. We validated our method by profiling 40,330 single cells from cell lines, a frozen tissue, and 27 FFPE samples from breast, lung, and prostate tumors stored for 3–31 years. Analysis of 10 patients with matched DCIS and cancers that recurred 2–16 years later show that many primary DCIS had already undergone whole-genome doubling and clonal diversification and that they shared genomic lineages with persistent subclones in the recurrences. Evolutionary analysis suggests that most DCIS cases in our cohort underwent an evolutionary bottleneck, and further identified chromosome aberrations in the persistent subclones that were associated with recurrence.

Abstract: Summary
Chloroplasts are eukaryotic photosynthetic organelles that drive the global carbon cycle. Despite their importance, our understanding of their protein composition, function, and spatial organization remains limited. Here, we determined the localizations of 1,034 candidate chloroplast proteins using fluorescent protein tagging in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The localizations provide insights into the functions of poorly characterized proteins; identify novel components of nucleoids, plastoglobules, and the pyrenoid; and reveal widespread protein targeting to multiple compartments. We discovered and further characterized cellular organizational features, including eleven chloroplast punctate structures, cytosolic crescent structures, and unexpected spatial distributions of enzymes within the chloroplast. We also used machine learning to predict the localizations of other nuclear-encoded Chlamydomonas proteins. The strains and localization atlas developed here will serve as a resource to accelerate studies of chloroplast architecture and functions.

Abstract: Summary
During viral infection, cells can deploy immune strategies that deprive viruses of molecules essential for their replication. Here, we report a family of immune effectors in bacteria that, upon phage infection, degrade cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond between the adenine and sugar moieties. These ATP nucleosidase effectors are widely distributed within multiple bacterial defense systems, including cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiviral signaling systems (CBASS), prokaryotic argonautes, and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-like proteins, and we show that ATP and dATP degradation during infection halts phage propagation. By analyzing homologs of the immune ATP nucleosidase domain, we discover and characterize Detocs, a family of bacterial defense systems with a two-component phosphotransfer-signaling architecture. The immune ATP nucleosidase domain is also encoded within diverse eukaryotic proteins with immune-like architectures, and we show biochemically that eukaryotic homologs preserve the ATP nucleosidase activity. Our findings suggest that ATP and dATP degradation is a cell-autonomous innate immune strategy conserved across the tree of life.

Abstract: Summary
A ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation is cooperative self-assembly between transcription factors (TFs) and DNA cis-regulatory motifs. It is thought that this strategy enables specific regulatory connections to be formed in gene networks between otherwise weakly interacting, low-specificity molecular components. Here, using synthetic gene circuits constructed in yeast, we find that high regulatory specificity can emerge from cooperative, multivalent interactions among artificial zinc-finger-based TFs. We show that circuits “wired” using the strategy of cooperative TF assembly are effectively insulated from aberrant misregulation of the host cell genome. As we demonstrate in experiments and mathematical models, this mechanism is sufficient to rescue circuit-driven fitness defects, resulting in genetic and functional stability of circuits in long-term continuous culture. Our naturally inspired approach offers a simple, generalizable means for building high-fidelity, evolutionarily robust gene circuits that can be scaled to a wide range of host organisms and applications.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogens produce diverse effector proteins to manipulate host cellular processes. However, how functional diversity is generated in an effector repertoire is poorly understood. Many effectors in the devastating plant pathogen Phytophthora contain tandem repeats of the “(L)WY” motif, which are structurally conserved but variable in sequences. Here, we discovered a functional module formed by a specific (L)WY-LWY combination in multiple Phytophthora effectors, which efficiently recruits the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) core enzyme in plant hosts. Crystal structure of an effector-PP2A complex shows that the (L)WY-LWY module enables hijacking of the host PP2A core enzyme to form functional holoenzymes. While sharing the PP2A-interacting module at the amino terminus, these effectors possess divergent C-terminal LWY units and regulate distinct sets of phosphoproteins in the host. Our results highlight the appropriation of an essential host phosphatase through molecular mimicry by pathogens and diversification promoted by protein modularity in an effector repertoire.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal epithelium has high intrinsic turnover rate, and the precise renewal of the epithelium is dependent on the microenvironment. The intestine is innervated by a dense network of peripheral nerves that controls various aspects of intestinal physiology. However, the role of neurons in regulating epithelial cell regeneration remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of gut-innervating adrenergic nerves on epithelial cell repair following irradiation (IR)-induced injury. We observed that adrenergic nerve density in the small intestine increased post IR, while chemical adrenergic denervation impaired epithelial regeneration. Single-cell RNA sequencing experiments revealed a decrease in IL-22 signaling post IR in denervated animals. Combining pharmacologic and genetic tools, we demonstrate that β-adrenergic receptor signaling drives IL-22 production from type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) post IR, which in turn promotes epithelial regeneration. These results define an adrenergic-ILC3 axis important for intestinal regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Antimicrobial resistance is a leading mortality factor worldwide. Here, we report the discovery of clovibactin, an antibiotic isolated from uncultured soil bacteria. Clovibactin efficiently kills drug-resistant Gram-positive bacterial pathogens without detectable resistance. Using biochemical assays, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and atomic force microscopy, we dissect its mode of action. Clovibactin blocks cell wall synthesis by targeting pyrophosphate of multiple essential peptidoglycan precursors (C55PP, lipid II, and lipid IIIWTA). Clovibactin uses an unusual hydrophobic interface to tightly wrap around pyrophosphate but bypasses the variable structural elements of precursors, accounting for the lack of resistance. Selective and efficient target binding is achieved by the sequestration of precursors into supramolecular fibrils that only form on bacterial membranes that contain lipid-anchored pyrophosphate groups. This potent antibiotic holds the promise of enabling the design of improved therapeutics that kill bacterial pathogens without resistance development.

Abstract: Summary
The number of sequenced viral genomes has surged recently, presenting an opportunity to understand viral diversity and uncover unknown regulatory mechanisms. Here, we conducted a screening of 30,367 viral segments from 143 species representing 96 genera and 37 families. Using a library of viral segments in 3′ UTR, we identified hundreds of elements impacting RNA abundance, translation, and nucleocytoplasmic distribution. To illustrate the power of this approach, we investigated K5, an element conserved in kobuviruses, and found its potent ability to enhance mRNA stability and translation in various contexts, including adeno-associated viral vectors and synthetic mRNAs. Moreover, we identified a previously uncharacterized protein, ZCCHC2, as a critical host factor for K5. ZCCHC2 recruits the terminal nucleotidyl transferase TENT4 to elongate poly(A) tails with mixed sequences, delaying deadenylation. This study provides a unique resource for virus and RNA research and highlights the potential of the virosphere for biological discoveries.

Abstract: Summary
Differential speeds in biochemical reactions have been proposed to be responsible for the differences in developmental tempo between mice and humans. However, the underlying mechanism controlling the species-specific kinetics remains to be determined. Using in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, we recapitulated the segmentation clocks of diverse mammalian species varying in body weight and taxa: marmoset, rabbit, cattle, and rhinoceros. Together with mouse and human, the segmentation clock periods of the six species did not scale with the animal body weight, but with the embryogenesis length. The biochemical kinetics of the core clock gene HES7 displayed clear scaling with the species-specific segmentation clock period. However, the cellular metabolic rates did not show an evident correlation. Instead, genes involving biochemical reactions showed an expression pattern that scales with the segmentation clock period. Altogether, our stem cell zoo uncovered general scaling laws governing species-specific developmental tempo.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains one of the grand challenges facing human society. Much controversy exists around the complex and multifaceted pathogenesis of this prevalent disease. Given strong human genetic evidence, there is little doubt, however, that microglia play an important role in preventing degeneration of neurons. For example, loss of function of the microglial gene Trem2 renders microglia dysfunctional and causes an early-onset neurodegenerative syndrome, and Trem2 variants are among the strongest genetic risk factors for AD. Thus, restoring microglial function represents a rational therapeutic approach. Here, we show that systemic hematopoietic cell transplantation followed by enhancement of microglia replacement restores microglial function in a Trem2 mutant mouse model of AD.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to map trafficking for thousands of endogenous proteins at once in living cells would reveal biology currently invisible to both microscopy and mass spectrometry. Here, we report TransitID, a method for unbiased mapping of endogenous proteome trafficking with nanometer spatial resolution in living cells. Two proximity labeling (PL) enzymes, TurboID and APEX, are targeted to source and destination compartments, and PL with each enzyme is performed in tandem via sequential addition of their small-molecule substrates. Mass spectrometry identifies the proteins tagged by both enzymes. Using TransitID, we mapped proteome trafficking between cytosol and mitochondria, cytosol and nucleus, and nucleolus and stress granules (SGs), uncovering a role for SGs in protecting the transcription factor JUN from oxidative stress. TransitID also identifies proteins that signal intercellularly between macrophages and cancer cells. TransitID offers a powerful approach for distinguishing protein populations based on compartment or cell type of origin.

Abstract: Summary
Ants communicate via large arrays of pheromones and possess expanded, highly complex olfactory systems, with antennal lobes in the brain comprising up to ∼500 glomeruli. This expansion implies that odors could activate hundreds of glomeruli, which would pose challenges for higher-order processing. To study this problem, we generated transgenic ants expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP in olfactory sensory neurons. Using two-photon imaging, we mapped complete glomerular responses to four ant alarm pheromones. Alarm pheromones robustly activated ≤6 glomeruli, and activity maps for the three pheromones inducing panic alarm in our study species converged on a single glomerulus. These results demonstrate that, rather than using broadly tuned combinatorial encoding, ants employ precise, narrowly tuned, and stereotyped representations of alarm pheromones. The identification of a central sensory hub glomerulus for alarm behavior suggests that a simple neural architecture is sufficient to translate pheromone perception into behavioral outputs.

Abstract: Summary
Sperm motility is crucial for successful fertilization. Highly decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) form the sperm tail skeleton, which propels the movement of spermatozoa. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based modeling, we determined the structures of mouse and human sperm DMTs and built an atomic model of the 48-nm repeat of the mouse sperm DMT. Our analysis revealed 47 DMT-associated proteins, including 45 microtubule inner proteins (MIPs). We identified 10 sperm-specific MIPs, including seven classes of Tektin5 in the lumen of the A tubule and FAM166 family members that bind the intra-tubulin interfaces. Interestingly, the human sperm DMT lacks some MIPs compared with the mouse sperm DMT. We also discovered variants in 10 distinct MIPs associated with a subtype of asthenozoospermia characterized by impaired sperm motility without evident morphological abnormalities. Our study highlights the conservation and tissue/species specificity of DMTs and expands the genetic spectrum of male infertility.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages are heterogeneous and play critical roles in development and disease, but their diversity, function, and specification remain inadequately understood during human development. We generated a single-cell RNA sequencing map of the dynamics of human macrophage specification from PCW 4–26 across 19 tissues. We identified a microglia-like population and a proangiogenic population in 15 macrophage subtypes. Microglia-like cells, molecularly and morphologically similar to microglia in the CNS, are present in the fetal epidermis, testicle, and heart. They are the major immune population in the early epidermis, exhibit a polarized distribution along the dorsal-lateral-ventral axis, and interact with neural crest cells, modulating their differentiation along the melanocyte lineage. Through spatial and differentiation trajectory analysis, we also showed that proangiogenic macrophages are perivascular across fetal organs and likely yolk-sac-derived as microglia. Our study provides a comprehensive map of the heterogeneity and developmental dynamics of human macrophages and unravels their diverse functions during development.

Lateral transduction (LT) is the process by which temperate phages mobilize large sections of bacterial genomes. Despite its importance, LT has only been observed during prophage induction. Here, we report that superantigen-carrying staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) employ a related but more versatile and complex mechanism of gene transfer to drive chromosomal hypermobility while self-transferring with additional virulence genes from the host. We found that after phage infection or prophage induction, activated SaPIs form concatamers in the bacterial chromosome by switching between parallel genomic tracks in replication bubbles. This dynamic life cycle enables SaPIbov1 to piggyback its LT of staphylococcal pathogenicity island vSaα, which encodes an array of genes involved in host-pathogen interactions, allowing both islands to be mobilized intact and transferred in a single infective particle. Our findings highlight previously unknown roles of pathogenicity islands in bacterial virulence and show that their evolutionary impact extends beyond the genes they carry.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosomes block access to DNA methyltransferase, unless they are remodeled by DECREASE in DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1LSH/HELLS), a Snf2-like master regulator of epigenetic inheritance. We show that DDM1 promotes replacement of histone variant H3.3 by H3.1. In ddm1 mutants, DNA methylation is partly restored by loss of the H3.3 chaperone HIRA, while the H3.1 chaperone CAF-1 becomes essential. The single-particle cryo-EM structure at 3.2 Å of DDM1 with a variant nucleosome reveals engagement with histone H3.3 near residues required for assembly and with the unmodified H4 tail. An N-terminal autoinhibitory domain inhibits activity, while a disulfide bond in the helicase domain supports activity. DDM1 co-localizes with H3.1 and H3.3 during the cell cycle, and with the DNA methyltransferase MET1Dnmt1, but is blocked by H4K16 acetylation. The male germline H3.3 variant MGH3/HTR10 is resistant to remodeling by DDM1 and acts as a placeholder nucleosome in sperm cells for epigenetic inheritance.

Abstract: Summary
Male sexual behavior is innate and rewarding. Despite its centrality to reproduction, a molecularly specified neural circuit governing innate male sexual behavior and reward remains to be characterized. We have discovered a developmentally wired neural circuit necessary and sufficient for male mating. This circuit connects chemosensory input to BNSTprTac1 neurons, which innervate POATacr1 neurons that project to centers regulating motor output and reward. Epistasis studies demonstrate that BNSTprTac1 neurons are upstream of POATacr1 neurons, and BNSTprTac1-released substance P following mate recognition potentiates activation of POATacr1 neurons through Tacr1 to initiate mating. Experimental activation of POATacr1 neurons triggers mating, even in sexually satiated males, and it is rewarding, eliciting dopamine release and self-stimulation of these cells. Together, we have uncovered a neural circuit that governs the key aspects of innate male sexual behavior: motor displays, drive, and reward.

Abstract: Summary
The endopeptidase ADAM10 is a critical catalyst for the regulated proteolysis of key drivers of mammalian development, physiology, and non-amyloidogenic cleavage of APP as the primary α-secretase. ADAM10 function requires the formation of a complex with a C8-tetraspanin protein, but how tetraspanin binding enables positioning of the enzyme active site for membrane-proximal cleavage remains unknown. We present here a cryo-EM structure of a vFab-ADAM10-Tspan15 complex, which shows that Tspan15 binding relieves ADAM10 autoinhibition and acts as a molecular measuring stick to position the enzyme active site about 20 Å from the plasma membrane for membrane-proximal substrate cleavage. Cell-based assays of N-cadherin shedding establish that the positioning of the active site by the interface between the ADAM10 catalytic domain and the bound tetraspanin influences selection of the preferred cleavage site. Together, these studies reveal the molecular mechanism underlying ADAM10 proteolysis at membrane-proximal sites and offer a roadmap for its modulation in disease.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer advantages for disease modeling and drug discovery. However, recreating innate cellular pathologies, particularly in late-onset neurodegenerative diseases with accumulated protein aggregates including Parkinson’s disease (PD), has been challenging. To overcome this barrier, we developed an optogenetics-assisted α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation induction system (OASIS) that rapidly induces α-syn aggregates and toxicity in PD hiPSC-midbrain dopaminergic neurons and midbrain organoids. Our OASIS-based primary compound screening with SH-SY5Y cells identified 5 candidates that were secondarily validated with OASIS PD hiPSC-midbrain dopaminergic neurons and midbrain organoids, leading us to finally select BAG956. Furthermore, BAG956 significantly reverses characteristic PD phenotypes in α-syn preformed fibril models in vitro and in vivo by promoting autophagic clearance of pathological α-syn aggregates. Following the FDA Modernization Act 2.0’s emphasis on alternative non-animal testing methods, our OASIS can serve as an animal-free preclinical test model (newly termed “nonclinical test”) for the synucleinopathy drug development.

Abstract: Summary
While adult pancreatic stem cells are thought not to exist, it is now appreciated that the acinar compartment harbors progenitors, including tissue-repairing facultative progenitors (FPs). Here, we study a pancreatic acinar population marked by trefoil factor 2 (Tff2) expression. Long-term lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of Tff2-DTR-CreERT2-targeted cells defines a transit-amplifying progenitor (TAP) population that contributes to normal homeostasis. Following acute and chronic injury, Tff2+ cells, distinct from FPs, undergo depopulation but are eventually replenished. At baseline, oncogenic KrasG12D-targeted Tff2+ cells are resistant to PDAC initiation. However, KrasG12D activation in Tff2+ cells leads to survival and clonal expansion following pancreatitis and a cancer stem/progenitor cell-like state. Selective ablation of Tff2+ cells prior to KrasG12D activation in Mist1+ acinar or Dclk1+ FP cells results in enhanced tumorigenesis, which can be partially rescued by adenoviral Tff2 treatment. Together, Tff2 defines a pancreatic TAP population that protects against Kras-driven carcinogenesis.
