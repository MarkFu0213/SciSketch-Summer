Abstract: Hydrolysis of VLDL triacylglycerol (TG) by lipoprotein lipase (LpL) is a major step in energy metabolism and VLDL-to-LDL maturation. Most functional LpL is anchored to the vascular endothelium, yet a small amount circulates on TG-rich lipoproteins. As circulating LpL has low catalytic activity, its role in VLDL remodeling is unclear. We use pre-heparin plasma and heparin-sepharose affinity chromatography to isolate VLDL fractions from normolipidemic, hypertriglyceridemic, or type-2 diabetic subjects. LpL is detected only in the heparin-bound fraction. Transient binding to heparin activates this VLDL-associated LpL, which hydrolyses TG, leading to gradual VLDL remodeling into IDL/LDL and HDL-size particles. The products and the timeframe of this remodeling closely resemble VLDL-to-LDL maturation in vivo. Importantly, the VLDL fraction that does not bind heparin is not remodeled. This relatively inert LpL-free VLDL is rich in TG and apoC-III, poor in apoE and apoC-II, shows impaired functionality as a substrate for the exogenous LpL or CETP, and likely has prolonged residence time in blood, which is expected to promote atherogenesis. This non-bound VLDL fraction increases in hypertriglyceridemia and in type-2 diabetes but decreases upon diabetes treatment that restores the glycemic control. In stark contrast, heparin binding by LDL increases in type-2 diabetes triggering pro-atherogenic LDL modifications. Therefore, the effects of heparin binding are associated negatively with atherogenesis for VLDL but positively for LDL. Collectively, the results reveal that binding to glycosaminoglycans initiates VLDL remodeling by circulating LpL, and suggest heparin binding as a marker of VLDL functionality and a readout for treatment of metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Reduction of lipid synthesis often causes free fatty acid (FFA) overload, resulting consequential oxidative stress and health damage. Environmental stresses also induce cellular oxidative stress in organisms. The functional peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (pparg) gene is essential for lipid synthesis and homeostatic lipid maintenance. However, the relationship between the pparg-mediated lipid synthesis and environmental stress adaptation awaits full elucidation. Here, we generated a pparg-knockout zebrafish model. The conversion of free fatty acids into triglycerides in the female pparg mutants was hampered by reduced esterification efficiency, thus induced lipotoxicity, as evidenced by high oxidative stress and damaged health in these mutants, which led to reduced resistance to cold, heat and ammonia nitrogen stresses. Activating pparg in the wild-type female fish via dietary supplementation with rosiglitazone (a pparg agonist), or reducing oxidative stress in the female pparg mutants via dietary supplementation with N-acetylcysteine (an antioxidant), or promoting mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation in the female pparg mutants via dietary supplementation with l-carnitine, resulted in significantly reduced cellular injury, and improved environmental stress resistance. Collectively, our findings reveal that the regulative function of pparg in FFA esterification is important in stress resistance in female fish, and highlight the tight correlation existing between lipotoxicity and environmental adaptation.

Abstract: An AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway is activated during myocardial ischemia and promotes cardiac fatty acid (FA) uptake and oxidation. Similarly, the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is also triggered by myocardial ischemia, but its function in FA metabolism remains unclear. Here, we explored the role of CaMKII in FA metabolism during myocardial ischemia by investigating the effects of cardiac CaMKII on AMPK-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), malonyl CoA decarboxylase (MCD), and FA translocase cluster of differentiation 36 (FAT/CD36), as well as cardiac FA uptake and oxidation. Moreover, we tested whether CaMKII and AMPK are binding partners. We demonstrated that diseased hearts from patients with terminal ischemic heart disease displayed increased phosphorylation of CaMKII, AMPK, and ACC and increased expression of MCD and FAT/CD36. AC3-I mice, which have a genetic myocardial inhibition of CaMKII, had reduced gene expression of cardiac AMPK. In post-MI (myocardial infarction) AC3-I hearts, AMPK-ACC phosphorylation, MCD and FAT/CD36 levels, cardiac FA uptake, and FA oxidation were significantly decreased. Notably, we demonstrated that CaMKII interacted with AMPK α1 and α2 subunits in the heart. Additionally, AC3-I mice displayed significantly less cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis 2 weeks post-MI. Overall, these findings reveal a unique role for CaMKII inhibition in repressing FA metabolism by interacting with AMPK signaling pathways, which may represent a novel mechanism in ischemic heart disease.

Abstract: Trans fatty acids (TFA) in food can cause liver inflammation. Activation of NOD-like receptor protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a key factor in the regulation of inflammation. Accumulating evidence suggests that ERS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation underlies the pathological basis of various inflammatory diseases, but the precise mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this paper focused on TFA, represented by elaidic acid (EA), to investigate the mechanism of liver inflammation. Levels of mRNA and protein were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, the release of proinflammatory cytokines was measured by ELISA, and intracellular Ca2+ levels were determined by flow cytometer using Fluo 4-AM fluorescent probes. Our research indicated that EA induced the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) response in Kupffer cells (KCs), accompanied by the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which resulted in NLRP3 inflammasome formation, and eventually increased the release of inflammatory factors. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was inhibited when KCs were pretreated with ERS inhibitors (4-PBA) and MAPK selective inhibitors. Furthermore, when ERS was blocked, the MAPK pathway was inhibited.

Abstract: Extracellular administration of side-chain oxysterols, such as 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC), 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) to cells suppresses HMG-CoA reductase (Hmgcr) and CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt2) mRNA levels. Oxysterols are enzymatically produced in cells from cholesterol by cytochrome P450 46A1 (Cyp46A1), Cyp27A1, Cyp3A11 and cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h). We analyzed which of these oxysterol-producing enzymes are expressed in NIH3T3 cells and found that only Cyp46A1 was expressed. When Cyp46A1 was overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells, intrinsic oxysterols increased in the order 24S-HC > 25-HC > 27-HC. We investigated the mechanism regulating the production of endogenous oxysterols in NIH3T3 cells by Cyp46A1 and found that the mRNA, relative protein levels and enzymatic activity of Cyp46A1, and the amounts of 24S-HC, 25-HC and 27-HC significantly increased under serum-starved conditions, and these increases were suppressed by FBS supplementation. The aqueous phase of FBS obtained by the Bligh & Dyer method significantly suppressed Cyp46A1 mRNA levels. Fractionation of the aqueous phase by HPLC and analysis of the inhibiting fractions by nanoLC and TripleTOF MS/MS identified insulin-like factor-II (IGF-II). Cyp46A1 mRNA levels in serum-starved NIH3T3 cells were significantly suppressed by the addition of IGFs and insulin and endogenous oxysterol levels were decreased. CYP46A1 mRNA levels in the T98G human glioblastoma cell line were also increased by serum starvation but not by FBS supplementation, and the aqueous phase did not inhibit the increase. These results suggest that mRNA levels of Cyp46A1 are regulated by factors in FBS.

Abstract: Oxylipins are oxygenated derivatives of polyunsaturated fatty acids, generated by COX, LOX and CYP enzymes, that regulate various aspects of endothelial cell physiology. Although 15-LOX and its products are positively associated with atherosclerosis, the relevant mechanisms have not been explored. The current study examined the effects of PD146176 (PD), a putative 15-LOX inhibitor, on EA.hy926 endothelial cell functions in the growing and confluent states. The effects of PD on endothelial cell oxylipin production (profiled by LC/MS/MS), cell viability, proliferation, eNOS activity, ICAM-1 and VE-cadherin levels were assessed. The contribution of signaling pathways relevant to endothelial function (p38 MAPK, Akt, PPARα) were also investigated. PD treatment for 30 min did not block formation of individual 15-LOX oxylipins, but 20 μM PD stimulated the accumulation of total LOX and COX products, while reducing several individual CYP products generated by epoxygenase. At 20 μM, the accumulated total oxylipins were primarily LOX-derived (86%) followed by COX (12%) and CYP (2%). PD altered cell functions by upregulating p38 MAPK and PPARα and downregulating Akt in a dose-dependent fashion. These observations suggest a link between PD-induced changes in oxylipins and altered endothelial cell functions via specific signaling pathways. In conclusion, the results of this study imply that PD does not function as a 15-LOX inhibitor in EA.hy926 endothelial cells, and instead inhibits CYP epoxygenase. These findings suggest that the cellular function changes induced by PD may be contingent upon its ability to modulate total oxylipin production, particularly by the LOX and CYP families.

Abstract: Non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) is a heat generating process controlled by the mitochondria of brown adipose tissue (BAT). In the recent decade, ‘functionally’ acting brown adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT) has been identified as well: the so-called process of the ‘browning’ of WAT. While the importance of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-oriented mitochondrial activation has been intensely studied, the role of peroxisomes during the browning of white adipocytes is poorly understood. Here, we assess the change in peroxisomal membrane proteins, or peroxins (PEXs), during cold stimulation and importantly, the role of PEX13 in the cold-induced remodeling of white adipocytes. PEX13, a protein that originally functions as a docking factor and is involved in protein import into peroxisome matrix, was highly increased during cold-induced recruitment of beige adipocytes within the inguinal WAT of C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, beige-induced 3 T3-L1 adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells by exposure to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist rosiglitazone showed a significant increase in mitochondrial thermogenic factors along with peroxisomal proteins including PEX13, and these were confirmed in SVF cells with the beta 3 adrenergic receptor (β3AR)-selective agonist CL316,243. To verify the relevance of PEX13, we used the RNA silencing method targeting the Pex13 gene and evaluated the subsequent beige development in SVF cells. Interestingly, siPex13 treatment suppressed expression of thermogenic proteins such as UCP1 and PPARγ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α). Overall, our data provide evidence supporting the role of peroxisomal proteins, in particular PEX13, during beige remodeling of white adipocytes.

Abstract: Inhibition of adipogenesis is an important strategy for obesity treatment. Rocaglamide-A (Roc-A) is a natural herbal medicine isolated from the genus Aglaia (family Meliaceae), which has a cyclopenta[b]benzofuran core structure. Roc-A exhibits various pharmacological effects against diverse human cancer cells. However, the exact role of Roc-A during adipogenesis in adipocytes has not been studied at all. In this study, we demonstrate that Roc-A is crucial for reducing adipogenesis via downregulating PPARγ transcriptional activity. Consistently, Western-blot and RT-PCR analyses clearly showed that Roc-A inhibits the expression of PPARγ target genes and lipogenic markers in a dose-dependent manner along with suppression of lipid accumulation, in both 3T3-L1 cells and mouse adipose-derived stem cells. Mechanistically, Roc-A significantly decreased STAT3 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In particular, we confirmed that Roc-A effectively suppressed the expression of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, such as cyclin A, B, D1, and E1, early during mitotic clonal expansion in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and this effect was abolished by the JAK2/STAT3 activator FGF2. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Roc-A reduces adipogenesis by inhibiting PPARγ transactivation and STAT3 phosphorylation and thus may serve as a therapeutic target in obesity.

Abstract: Lipoxygenases (LOXs) biosynthesize lipid mediators (LMs) as human signaling molecules. Among LMs, specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are involved in the resolution of inflammation and infection in humans. Here, the putative LOX from the bacterium Sphingopyxis macrogoltabida was identified as arachidonate 9S-LOX. The enzyme catalyzed oxygenation at the n-12 position of C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to form 9S- and 11S-hydroperoxy fatty acids, which were reduced to 9S- and 11S-hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs) by cysteine, respectively, and it catalyzed again oxygenation at the n-6 position of HFAs to form 9S,15S- and 11S,17S-DiHFAs, respectively. The regioselective residues of 9S-LOX were determined as lle395 and Val569 based on the amino acid alignment and homology models. The regioselectivity of the I395F variant was changed from the n-12 position on C20 PUFA to the n-6 position to form 15S-HFAs. This may be due to the reduction of the substrate-binding pocket by replacing the smaller Ile with a larger Phe. The V569W variant had a significantly lower second‑oxygenating activity compared to wild-type 9S-LOX because the insertion of the hydroxyl group of the first‑oxygenating products at the active site was seemed to be hindered by substituting a larger Trp for a smaller Val. The compounds, 11S-hydroxydocosapentaenoic acid, 9S,15S-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 9S,15S-dihydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid, 11S,17S-hydroxydocosapentaenoic acid, and 11S,17S-dihydroxydocosahexaenoic acid, were newly identified by polarimeter, LC-MS/MS, and NMR. 11S,17S-DiHFAs as SPM isomers biosynthesized from C22 PUFAs showed anti-inflammatory activities in mouse and human cells. Our study contributes may stimulate physiological studies by providing new LMs.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence suggests that hyperlipidemia is associated with obesity and cancer mortality in humans. We tested the hypotheses that inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) would attenuate obesity-induced hyperlipidemia and reduce tumor growth by treating BCR-ABL B cell tumor-bearing hyperlipidemic obese ob/ob obese mice with a MTP inhibitor. MTP inhibition in tumor-bearing mice reduced concentrations of plasma apoB100 5-fold together with a corresponding decrease in VLDL triacylglycerol (TG) and cholesterol. Inhibition of MTP decreased tumor volume by 50%. MTP inhibitor did not alter tumor cell viability in vitro, suggesting that the in vivo tumor shrinkage effect was related to altered circulating lipids. Tumor volume reduction occurred without change in the protein expression of LDLR, FASN and HMGCR in the tumor, suggesting a lack of compensatory mechanisms in response to decreased hyperlipidemia. Expression of genes encoding GLUT4 and PEPCK was increased 6- and 10-fold, respectively, but no change in the expression of genes encoding regulatory enzymes of glycolysis was observed, suggesting that the tumors were not dependent on or switching to carbohydrates for energy requirement to support their growth. No change of proliferative signaling PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways after MTP inhibition was observed in the tumors. In conclusion, MTP inhibition decreased dyslipidemia and tumor growth in obese, insulin resistant mice. Therefore, decreasing VLDL secretion could be further explored as an adjuvant therapeutic intervention together with standard care to reduce tumor growth in obese patients.

Abstract: N-[4-hydroxyphenyl]retinamide, commonly known as fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid with pleiotropic benefits for human health, is currently utilized in clinical trials for cancer, cystic fibrosis, and COVID-19. However, fenretinide reduces plasma vitamin A levels by interacting with retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), which often results in reversible night blindness in patients. Cell culture and in vitro studies show that fenretinide binds and inhibits the activity of β-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1), the enzyme responsible for endogenous vitamin A formation. Whether fenretinide inhibits vitamin A synthesis in mammals, however, remains unknown. The goal of this study was to determine if the inhibition of BCO1 by fenretinide affects vitamin A formation in mice fed β-carotene. Our results show that wild-type mice treated with fenretinide for ten days had a reduction in tissue vitamin A stores accompanied by a two-fold increase in β-carotene in plasma (P < 0.01) and several tissues. These effects persisted in RBP4-deficient mice and were independent of changes in intestinal β-carotene absorption, suggesting that fenretinide inhibits vitamin A synthesis in mice. Using Bco1−/− and Bco2−/− mice we also show that fenretinide regulates intestinal carotenoid and vitamin E uptake by activating vitamin A signaling during short-term vitamin A deficiency. This study provides a deeper understanding of the impact of fenretinide on vitamin A, carotenoid, and vitamin E homeostasis, which is crucial for the pharmacological utilization of this retinoid.

Abstract: Cardiometabolic risk factors increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but whether these metabolic anomalies affect the anti-atherogenic function of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is not yet clearly known. The present study aimed to delineate if the function and maturation of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles cross-sectionally associate with surrogate markers of ASCVD in a population comprising of different degree of cardiometabolic risk. We enrolled 131 subjects and characterized cardiometabolic risk based on the IDF criteria's for metabolic syndrome (MS). In this population, cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), Lecithin–cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and ApoA-1 glycation was associated with waist circumference, abdominal visceral fat (VFA) and abdominal subcutaneous fat. In multivariate analyses, VFA was identified as a critical contributor for low CEC and LCAT. When stratified into groups based on the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors, we found a prominent reduction in CEC and LCAT as a function of the progressive increase of cardiometabolic risk from 0–2, 0–3 to 0–4/5, whereas an increase in Pre-β-HDL and ApoA-1 glycation was observed between the lowest and highest risk groups. These findings confirm the connection between MS and its predisposing conditions to an impairment of atheroprotective efflux-promoting function of HDLs. Furthermore, we have identified the bona fide pathogenically contribution of abdominal obesity to profound alterations of key metrics of RCT.

Abstract: Fatty acids have a high turnover rate in cancer cells to supply energy for tumor growth and proliferation. Lipolysis is particularly important for the regulation of fatty acid homeostasis and in the maintenance of cancer cells. In the current study, we explored how 2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductase (DECR1), a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase associated with mitochondrial and cytoplasmic compartments, promotes cancer cell growth. We report that DECR1 overexpression significantly reduced the triglyceride (TAG) content in HeLa cells; conversely, DECR1 silencing increased intracellular TAG content. Subsequently, our experiments demonstrate that DECR1 promotes lipolysis via effects on hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). The direct interaction of DECR1 with HSL increases HSL phosphorylation and activity, facilitating the translocation of HSL to lipid droplets. The ensuing enhancement of lipolysis thus increases the release of free fatty acids. Downstream effects include the promotion of cervical cancer cell migration and growth, associated with the enhanced levels of p62 protein. In summary, high levels of DECR1 serves to enhance lipolysis and the release of fatty acid energy stores to support cervical cancer cell growth.

Several metabolic abnormalities are observed in BTHS patients and model systems, including decreased oxidative phosphorylation, reduced tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux, and accumulated lactate and D-β-hydroxybutyrate, which strongly suggests that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) redox metabolism may be altered in CL-deficient cells. In this study, we identified abnormal NAD+ metabolism in multiple BTHS model systems and demonstrate that supplementation of NAD+ precursors such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) improves mitochondrial function. Improved mitochondrial function in the Drosophila model was associated with restored exercise endurance, which suggests a potential therapeutic benefit of NAD+ precursor supplementation in the management of BTHS patients.

Abstract: Enzymes related to sphingolipids metabolism has been suggested as altered in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, clinical relevance of diverse sphingolipids in OSCC is not fully known. Here, we evaluated sphingolipidomics in plasma and tumor tissues as a tool for diagnosis/prognosis in OSCC patients. Plasma was obtained from 58 controls and 56 OSCC patients, and paired tumor and surgical margin tissues (n = 42). The levels of 28 sphingolipids molecules were obtained by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, sphingolipids were analyzed with clinical and pathological characteristics to search the potential for diagnosis and prognosis. Lower levels of 17 sphingolipids was found in the plasma of OSCC patients compared to controls while four were elevated in tumor tissues. C18:0 dyhidroceramide and C24:0 lactosylceramide in plasma were associated with perineural invasion, while tissue levels of ceramide and dyhidroceramide were associated with advanced tumor stage and perineural invasion. High plasma levels of C24:0 ceramide (HR = 0.10, p = 0.0036) and C24:1 glucosylceramide (HR = 6.62, p = 0.0023), and tissue levels of C24:0 dyhidroceramide (HR = 3.95, p = 0.032) were identified as independent prognostic factors. Moreover, we identified signatures composed by i) sphinganine-1-phosphate and C16 ceramide-1-phosphate in plasma with significant diagnostic accuracy, while ii) C24:0 ceramide, C24:0 dyhidroceramide, and C24:1 glucosylceramide plasma levels, and iii) C24:0 dyhidrosphingomyelin and C24:0 ceramide tissue levels showed value to predict survival in patients aged 60 years or older. We proposed the sphingolipids signatures in plasma and tumor tissues as biomarkers candidates to diagnosis and prognosis in OSCC.

Abstract: The protein encoded by the G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) is a potent inhibitor of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and thus an important regulator of intracellular lipolysis. Since dysfunction of lipolysis is associated with metabolic diseases including diabetes and obesity, inhibition of ATGL is considered a therapeutic strategy. G0S2 interacts with ATGL's patatin-domain to mediate non-competitive inhibition, however atomic details of the inhibition mechanism are incompletely understood. Sequences of G0S2 from higher organisms show a highly conserved N-terminal part, including a hydrophobic region covering amino acids 27 to 42. We show that predicted G0S2 orthologs from platypus, chicken and Japanese rice-fish are able to inhibit human and mouse ATGL, emphasizing the contribution of conserved amino acid to ATGL inhibition. Our site directed mutagenesis and truncation studies give insights in the protein-protein interaction on a per-residue level. We determine that the minimal sequence required for ATGL inhibition ranges from amino acids 20 to 44. Residues Y27, V28, G30, A34 G37, V39 or L42 within this sequence play a substantial role in ATGL inhibition. Furthermore, we show that unspecific interactions of the N-terminal part (amino acids 20-27) of the minimal sequence facilitate the interaction to ATGL. Our studies also demonstrate that full-length G0S2 shows higher tolerance to specific single amino acid exchanges in the hydrophobic region due to the stronger contributions of unspecific interactions. However, exchanges of more than one amino-acid in the hydrophobic region also result in the loss of function as ATGL inhibitor even in the full-length protein.

Enterocyte-specific ATGL overexpression affects intestinal and systemic cholesterol homeostasis,

Abstract: Enterocytes of the small intestine (SI) play an important role in maintaining systemic lipid levels by regulating dietary lipid absorption and postprandial lipoprotein secretion. An excessive amount of dietary-derived triglycerides (TGs) taken up by the apical side of enterocytes or basolaterally internalized lipoprotein remnants can be transiently stored in cytosolic lipid droplets (cLDs). As mice lacking adipose TG lipase (ATGL) in the SI display massive accumulation of cLDs but also delayed cholesterol absorption, we hypothesized that SI-specific overexpression of ATGL (Atgl iTg) might have beneficial effects on lipid homeostasis in the gut and possibly throughout the body. Here, we demonstrate that Atgl iTg mice had only modestly increased enzymatic activity despite drastically elevated Atgl mRNA levels (up to 120-fold) on chow diet, and was highly induced upon high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (HF/HCD) feeding. Atgl iTg mice showed markedly reduced intestinal TG concentrations after acute and chronic lipid challenge without affecting chylomicron TG secretion. Circulating plasma cholesterol levels were significantly lower in Atgl iTg mice under different feeding conditions, contrasting the accelerated uptake of dietary cholesterol into the circulation after HF/HCD feeding. In the fasted state, gene expression analysis revealed modulation of PPARα and liver X receptor (LXR) target genes by an increased fatty acid release, whereas the decreased plasma cholesterol concentrations in refed mice were more likely due to changes in HDL synthesis and secretion. We conclude that ATGL, in addition to its role in TG catabolism, plays a critical role in whole-body cholesterol homeostasis by modulating PPARα and LXR signaling in intestinal enterocytes.

Abstract: Quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) store vitamin A as lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. When activated, these cells lose vitamin A and exhibit an increased capacity for proliferation, mobility, contractility, and the synthesis of collagen and other components of the extracellular matrix. Our previous work demonstrated that the lipid hydrolytic gene pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (mPlrp2) is involved in the hydrolysis of retinyl esters (REs) in the liver. Here, we showed that bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver injury triggered the conditional expression of mPlrp2 in livers and describe evidence of a strong relationship between the expression of mPlrp2 and Acta-2, a marker for activated HSCs. RNA interference targeting mPlrp2 inhibited HSC activation and ameliorated hepatic fibrosis induced by BDL in mice. Liver BDL markedly reduced the adenosine level and increased the ratio between S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated an increase in trimethylated histone H3K4 at the mPlrp2 promoter in BDL mice, which was associated with the conditional expression of mPlrp2 in the liver. SAM, a well-known hepatoprotective substance, inhibited mPlrp2 expression and reduced RE hydrolysis in mice with hepatic fibrosis induced by chronic CCl4 treatment. Liver fibrosis induced by CCl4 or BDL was improved in Plrp2−/− mice. Our results reveal that mPlrp2 suppression is a potential approach for treating hepatic fibrosis.

Abstract: Lung cancer represents one of the leading worldwide causes of cancer death, but the pathobiochemistry of this disease is still not fully understood. Here we characterize the lipidomic and metabolomic profiles of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues for 23 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. In total, 500 molecular species were identified and quantified by a combination of the lipidomic shotgun tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis and the targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography (LC) – MS/MS. The statistical evaluation includes multivariate and univariate methods with the emphasis on paired statistical approaches. Our research revealed significant changes in several biochemical pathways related to the central carbon metabolism, acylcarnitines, dipeptides as well as the disruption in the lipid metabolism observed mainly for glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesteryl esters.

Abstract: Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7) performs incompletely understood biochemical functions that affect pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. ABCA7 is most similar in primary structure to ABCA1, the protein that mediates cell lipid efflux and formation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Lipid metabolic labeling/tracer efflux assays were employed to investigate lipid efflux in BHK-ABCA7(low expression), BHK-ABCA7(high expression) and BHK-ABCA1 cells. Shotgun lipid mass spectrometry was used to determine lipid composition of HDL synthesized by BHK-ABCA7 and BHK-ABCA1 cells. BHK-ABCA7(low) cells exhibited significant efflux only of choline-phospholipid and phosphatidylinositol. BHK-ABCA7(high) cells had significant cholesterol and choline-phospholipid efflux to apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, apo E, the 18A peptide, HDL, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid and significant efflux of sphingosine-lipid, serine-lipid (which is composed of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine in BHK cells) and phosphatidylinositol to apo A-I. In efflux assays to apo A-I, after adjustment to choline-phospholipid, ABCA7-mediated efflux removed ~4 times more serine-lipid and phosphatidylinositol than ABCA1-mediated efflux, while ABCA1-mediated efflux removed ~3 times more cholesterol than ABCA7-mediated efflux. Shotgun lipidomic analysis revealed that ABCA7-HDL had ~20 mol% less phosphatidylcholine and 3–5 times more serine-lipid and phosphatidylinositol than ABCA1-HDL, while ABCA1-HDL contained only ~6 mol% (or ~1.1 times) more cholesterol than ABCA7-HDL. The discrepancy between the tracer efflux assays and shotgun lipidomics with respect to cholesterol may be explained by an underestimate of ABCA7-mediated cholesterol efflux in the former approach. Overall, these results suggest that ABCA7 lacks specificity for phosphatidylcholine and releases significantly but not dramatically less cholesterol in comparison with ABCA1.

Abstract: Introduction
Imbalanced cholesterol metabolism in the brain is one of the main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the effect of amyloid-beta (Aβ) on the main proteins involved in regulation of cholesterol metabolism along with cholesterol content in astrocytes and neurons.
Methods
Astrocytes and neurons were cultured and treated with Aβ. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) level in the cells and conditioned media, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1) in cell lysates were determined using immunoblotting. Astrocyte media was added to the Aβ-pretreated neurons then, HMGCR was assessed. Cholesterol was measured in both cells and media.
Results
Aβ caused a significant increase in HMGCR and ABCA1 protein levels and cholesterol content in both cells without increasing cholesterol efflux. A similar increase was seen for cellular apoE level in astrocytes with no changes in media with a significant reduction of cholesterol efflux. HMGCR level was restored to near control level when Aβ-pretreated neurons were exposed to media from culture astrocytes.
Conclusion
Almost all events related to cholesterol homeostasis in neurons and astrocytes, are somehow affected by Aβ. However, because ABCA1 has the most important role(s) in brain cholesterol homeostasis, all subsequent events associated with astrocytes-cholesterol synthesis and its shuttling to neurons are influenced by the effects of Aβ on ABCA1 which could likely be responsible for altered brain cholesterol metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Obesity leads to persistent increases in immune responses that contribute to cardiometabolic pathologies such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Pro-inflammatory macrophages infiltrate the expanding fat mass, which leads to increased production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Moreover, saturated fatty acids enhance signaling through the toll-like receptors involved in innate immunity. Herein we discuss the evidence that ceramides—which are intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway that produces sphingolipids—are essential intermediates that link these inflammatory signals to impaired tissue function. We discuss the mechanisms linking these immune insults to ceramide production and review the numerous ceramide actions that alter cellular metabolism, induce oxidative stress, and stimulate apoptosis. Lastly, we evaluate the correlation of ceramides in humans with inflammation-linked cardiometabolic disease and discuss preclinical studies which suggest that ceramide-lowering interventions may be an effective strategy to treat or prevent such maladies.

Abstract: Inositol plays a significant role in cellular function and signaling. Studies in yeast have demonstrated an “inositol-less death” phenotype, suggesting that inositol is an essential metabolite. In yeast, inositol synthesis is highly regulated, and inositol levels have been shown to be a major metabolic regulator, with its abundance affecting the expression of hundreds of genes. Abnormalities in inositol metabolism have been associated with several human disorders. Despite its importance, very little is known about the regulation of inositol synthesis and the pathways regulated by inositol in human cells. The current study aimed to address this knowledge gap. Knockout of ISYNA1 (encoding myo-inositol-3-P synthase 1) in HEK293T cells generated a human cell line that is deficient in de novo inositol synthesis. ISYNA1-KO cells exhibited inositol-less death when deprived of inositol. Lipidomic analysis identified inositol deprivation as a global regulator of phospholipid levels in human cells, including downregulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and upregulation of the phosphatidylglycerol (PG)/cardiolipin (CL) branch of phospholipid metabolism. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that inositol deprivation induced substantial changes in the expression of genes involved in cell signaling, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and genes controlling amino acid transport and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This study provides the first in-depth characterization of the effects of inositol deprivation on phospholipid metabolism and gene expression in human cells, establishing an essential role for inositol in maintaining cell viability and regulating cell signaling and metabolism.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LDs) are common organelles observed in Eucaryota. They are multifunctional organelles (involved in lipid storage, metabolism, and trafficking) that originate from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). LDs consist of a neutral lipid core, made up of diacyl- and triacylglycerols (DAGs and TAGs) and cholesterol esters (CEs), surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer and proteins, which are necessary for their structure and dynamics. Here, we report the protein and lipid composition as well as characterization and dynamics of grass snake (Natrix natrix) skeletal muscle LDs at different developmental stages. In the present study, we used detailed morphometric, LC-MS, quantitative lipidomic analyses of LDs isolated from the skeletal muscles of the snake embryos, immunofluorescence, and TEM. Our study also provides a valuable insight concerning the LDs' multifunctionality and ability to interact with a variety of organelles. These LD features are reflected in their proteome composition, which contains scaffold proteins, metabolic enzymes signalling polypeptides, proteins necessary for the formation of docking sites, and many others. We also provide insights into the biogenesis and growth of muscle LDs goes beyond the conventional mechanism based on the synthesis and incorporation of TAGs and LD fusion. We assume that the formation and functioning of grass snake muscle LDs are based on additional mechanisms that have not yet been identified, which could be related to the unique features of reptiles that are manifested in the after-hatching period of life, such as a reptile-specific strategy for energy saving during hibernation.

Abstract: Ghrelin, classically known as a central appetite-stimulating hormone, has recently been recognized to play an important role in peripheral tissue energy metabolism. In chicken, contrary to mammal, ghrelin acts as an anorexia signal, increased by fasting and further elevated after refed. In the present study, the effect of ghrelin on glucose/lipid utilization by peripheral tissues was investigated. Injection of exogenous acyl ghrelin reduced plasma triglyceride and glucose levels of chickens at both fasting and fed status. In the in vitro cultured chicken primary hepatocytes, adipocytes, and myoblasts, ghrelin suppressed glucose uptake, stimulated fatty acids uptake and oxidation, and decreased TG content. In hepatocyte, ghrelin increased the activities of LPL and HL, and upregulated the expression levels of gene ACC, CPT1, and PPARα. Ghrelin treatment markedly increased the protein level of p-ACC, PPARγ, PGC1α, and CPT1 in hepatocytes, adipocytes and myoblasts. Inhibition of AMPK activity by Compound C had no influence on glucose uptake by hepatocyte, adipocyte, and myoblast, but further amplified the stimulated fatty acid uptake of adipocyte by ghrelin. The present result demonstrates that ghrelin facilitates the uptake and oxidation of fatty acid and cut down the utilization of glucose by the liver, muscle, and adipose tissues. The result suggests that ghrelin functions as a signal of fatty acid oxidation. The study provides a vital framework for understanding the intrinsic role of ghrelin as a crucial factor in the concerted regulation of metabolic substrate of hepatocytes, adipocytes, and myoblasts.

Abstract: In addition to maintaining bile acid, cholesterol and glucose homeostasis, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) also regulates fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO). To explore the different roles of hepatic and intestinal FXR in liver FAO, FAO-associated metabolites, including acylcarnitines and fatty acids, and FXR target gene mRNAs were profiled using an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis in control (Fxrfl/fl), liver-specific Fxr-null (FxrΔHep) and intestine-specific Fxr-null (FxrΔIE) mice, treated either with the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) or vehicle (VEH). Activation of FXR by OCA treatment significantly increased fatty acyl-CoA hydrolysis (Acot1) and decreased FAO-associated mRNAs in Fxrfl/fl mice, resulting in reduced levels of total acylcarnitines and relative accumulation of long/medium chain acylcarnitines and fatty acids in liver. FxrΔHep mice responded to OCA treatment in a manner similar to Fxrfl/fl mice while FxrΔIE mice responded differently, thus illustrating that intestinal FXR plays a critical role in the regulation of hepatic FAO. A significant negative-correlation between intestinal FXR-FGF15 and hepatic CREB-PGC1A pathways was observed after both VEH and OCA treatment, suggesting that OCA-induced activation of the intestinal FXR-FGF15 axis downregulates hepatic PGC1α signaling via inactivation of hepatic CREB, thus repressing FAO. This mechanism was confirmed in experiments based on human recombinant FGF19 treatment and intestinal Fgf15-null mice. This study revealed an important role for the intestinal FXR-FGF15 pathway in hepatic FAO repression.

Abstract: Reversible phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol by phosphoinositide (PI) kinases and phosphatases generates seven distinct phosphoinositide phosphates, called phosphoinositides or PIPs. All seven PIPs are formed in the retina and photoreceptor cells. Around 50 genes in the mammalian genome encode PI kinases and PI phosphatases. There are no studies available on the distribution of these enzymes in the retina and photoreceptors.
Aim
To employ Ribosomal Targeting Strategy and Nuclear Labeling to Analyze Phosphoinositide Signatures in rod-photoreceptor cells.
Methods
HA-tagging of ribosomal protein Rpl22 was induced with Cre-recombinase under the control of the rhodopsin promoter. Actively translating mRNAs associated with polyribosomes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with HA antibody, followed by RNA isolation and gene identification. We also isolated biotinylated-rod nuclei from NuTRAP mice under the control of the rhodopsin-Cre promoter and analyzed nuclear phosphoinositides.
Results
Our results indicate that the expression of class I and class III PI 3-kinase, PI4K IIIβ, PI 5-kinase, PIKfyve, PI3-phosphatases, MTMR2, 4, 6, 7, 14, PI4-phosphatase, TMEM55A, PI 5-phosphatases, SYNJI, INPP5B, INPP5E, INPP5F, SKIP and other phosphatases with dual substrate specificity, PTPMT1, SCAM1, and FIG4 are highly enriched in rod photoreceptor cells compared with the retina and cone-like retina. Our analysis identified the presence of PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, and PI(4,5)P2 in the rod nuclei.
Conclusions
Our studies for the first time demonstrate the expression of PI kinases, PI phosphatases, and nuclear PIPs in rod photoreceptor cells. The NuTRAP mice may be useful not only for epigenetic and transcriptomic studies but also for in vivo cell-specific lipidomics research.

Due to their diverse susceptibility towards metabolic diseases, mouse inbred strains have been proven to serve as powerful tools for the identification of novel genetic factors that underlie the pathophysiology of NAFLD and diabetes. Transcriptome analysis of mouse liver samples revealed the nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X-type motif Nudt19 as novel candidate gene responsible for NAFLD and T2D development. Knockdown (KD) of Nudt19 increased mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP production rates in Hepa 1–6 cells by 41% and 10%, respectively. The enforced utilization of glutamine or fatty acids as energy substrate reduced uncoupled respiration by 41% and 47%, respectively, in non-target (NT) siRNA transfected cells. This reduction was prevented upon Nudt19 KD. Furthermore, incubation with palmitate or oleate respectively increased mitochondrial ATP production by 31% and 20%, and uncoupled respiration by 23% and 30% in Nudt19 KD cells, but not in NT cells. The enhanced fatty acid oxidation in Nudt19 KD cells was accompanied by a 1.3-fold increased abundance of Pdk4. This study is the first to describe Nudt19 as regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism and potential mediator of NAFLD and T2D development.

Abstract: Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) results in intestinal inflammation, increased redox stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, imbalanced inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines, compromised barrier function, and perturbations of the gut microbiome. To combat VAD dietary interventions with β-carotene, the most abundant precursor of vitamin A, are recommended. However, the impact of β-carotene on intestinal health during VAD has not been fully clarified, especially regarding the VAD-associated intestinal dysbiosis. Here we addressed this question by using Lrat−/-Rbp−/− (vitamin A deficient) mice deprived of dietary preformed vitamin A and supplemented with β-carotene as the sole source of the vitamin, alongside with WT (vitamin A sufficient) mice. We found that dietary β-carotene impacted intestinal vitamin A status, barrier integrity and inflammation in both WT and Lrat−/-Rbp−/− (vitamin A deficient) mice on the vitamin A-free diet. However, it did so to a greater extent under overt VAD. Dietary β-carotene also modified the taxonomic profile of the fecal microbiome, but only under VAD. Given the similarity of the VAD-associated intestinal phenotypes with those of several other disorders of the gut, collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Syndrome, these findings are broadly relevant to the effort of developing diet-based intervention strategies to ameliorate intestinal pathological conditions.

Abstract: Background
Obesity and type 2 diabetes are two interrelated metabolic disorders characterized by insulin resistance and a mild chronic inflammatory state. We previously observed that leptin (ob/ob) and leptin receptor (db/db) knockout mice display a distinct inflammatory tone in the liver and adipose tissue. The present study aimed at investigating whether alterations in these tissues of the molecules belonging to the endocannabinoidome (eCBome), an extension of the endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system, whose functions are important in the context of metabolic disorders and inflammation, could reflect their different inflammatory phenotypes.
Results
The basal eCBome lipid and gene expression profiles, measured by targeted lipidomics and qPCR transcriptomics, respectively, in the liver and subcutaneous or visceral adipose tissues, highlighted a differentially altered eCBome tone, which may explain the impaired hepatic function and more pronounced liver inflammation remarked in the ob/ob mice, as well as the more pronounced inflammatory state observed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of db/db mice. In particular, the levels of linoleic acid-derived endocannabinoid-like molecules, of one of their 12-lipoxygenase metabolites and of Trpv2 expression, were always altered in tissues exhibiting the highest inflammation. Correlation studies suggested the possible interactions with some gut microbiota bacterial taxa, whose respective absolute abundances were significantly different between ob/ob and the db/db mice.
Conclusions
The present findings emphasize the possibility that bioactive lipids and the respective receptors and enzymes belonging to the eCBome may sustain the tissue-dependent inflammatory state that characterizes obesity and diabetes, possibly in relation with gut microbiome alterations.

Crucial importance of length of fatty-acyl chains bound to the sn-2 position of phosphatidylglycerol for growth and photosynthesis of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803,

Abstract: Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in thylakoid membrane is essential for growth and photosynthesis of photosynthetic organisms. Although the sn-2 position of PG in thylakoid membrane is exclusively esterified with C16 fatty acids, the functional importance of the C16 fatty-acyl chains at the sn-2 position has not been clarified. In this study, we chemically synthesized non-metabolizable PG molecules: we introduced linoleic acid (18:2, fatty acid containing 18 carbons with 2 double bonds) and one of the saturated fatty acids with different chain length (12:0, 14:0, 16:0, 18:0 and 20:0) by ether linkage to the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, respectively. With the synthesized ether-linked PG molecules, we checked whether they could complement the growth and photosynthesis of pgsA mutant cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to understand the importance of length of fatty chains at the sn-2 position of PG. The pgsA mutant is incapable of synthesizing PG, so it requires exogenous PG added to medium for growth. The growth rate and photosynthetic activity of mutant cells depended on the length of fatty chains: the PG molecular species binding 16:0 most effectively complemented the growth and photosynthesis of mutant cells, and other PG molecular species with fatty chains shorter or longer than 16:0 were less effective; especially, those binding 12:0 inhibited the growth and photosynthetic activity of the mutant cells. These data demonstrate that length of fatty chains bound to the sn-2 position of PG is critical for PG performance in growth and photosynthesis.

Abstract: The calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A (ANO1) supports the passive movement of chloride ions across membranes and controls critical cell functions. Here we study the block of wild-type and mutant TMEM16A channels expressed in HEK293 cells by oleic acid, a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid beneficial for cardiovascular health. We found that oleic acid irreversibly blocks TMEM16A in a dose- and voltage-dependent manner at low intracellular Ca2+. We tested whether oleic acid interacted with the TMEM16A pore, varying the permeant anion concentration and mutating pore residues. Lowering the permeating anion concentration in the intracellular side did nothing but the blockade was intensified by increasing the anion concentration in the extracellular side. However, the blockade of the pore mutants E633A and I641A was voltage-independent, and the I641A IC50, a mutant with the inner hydrophobic gate in disarray, increased 16-fold. Furthermore, the uncharged methyl-oleate blocked 20–24% of the wild-type and I641A channels regardless of voltage. Our findings suggest that oleic acid inhibits TMEM16A by an allosteric mechanism after the electric field drives oleic acid's charged moiety inside the pore. Block of TMEM16A might be why oleic acid has a beneficial impact on the cardiovascular system.

Abstract: The majority of peripheral and central nervous system disorders are related to hyperactive inflammatory responses, leading to irreversible and persistent cellular defects, functional impairments, and behavioral deficits. Advances in our understanding of these disorders have revealed the disruption of inflammation resolution pathways due to abrogated responses by specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs). SPMs comprise a class of bioactive lipids and cell signaling molecules that function to resolve inflammation, pain, and function in host defense and tissue remodeling. Their cellular and systemic levels during physiology and pathology are regulated by sphingosine kinases (especially SphK1) that act by monitoring cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), a potent inhibitor of SPMs production. This review presents the current understanding of the convergent mechanisms shared by bioactive lipids with SphK1 and COX2 in the etiology of chronic inflammatory disorders, focusing on neuroinflammation, as well as describes the translational directions of this trilogy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Adipose tissue is a critical organ for nutrient sensing, energy storage and maintaining metabolic health. The failure of adipose tissue homeostasis leads to metabolic disease that is seen during obesity or aging. Local metabolic processes are coordinated by interacting microenvironments that make up the complexity and heterogeneity of the adipose tissue. Catecholamine-induced lipolysis, a critical pathway in adipocytes that drives the release of stored triglyceride as free fatty acid after stimulation, is impaired during aging. The impairment of this pathway is associated with a failure to maintain a healthy body weight, core body-temperature during cold stress or mount an immune response. Along with impairments in aged adipocytes, aging is associated with an accumulation of inflammation, immune cell activation, and increased dysfunction in the nervous and lymphatic systems within the adipose tissue. Together these microenvironments support the initiation of stimulated lipolysis and the transport of free fatty acid under conditions of metabolic homeostasis. However, during aging, the defects in these cellular systems result in a reduction in ability to stimulate lipolysis. This review will focus on how the immune, nervous and lymphatic systems interact during tissue homeostasis, review areas that are impaired with aging and discuss areas of research that are currently unclear.

Abstract: Legionella micdadei is responsible for community- or nosocomial-acquired pneumonia as well as the influenza-like illness Pontiac fever. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of L. micdadei to utilize extracellular choline for phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis and its consequences for the phospholipid composition of its membrane system and the interaction with the human LL-37 peptide. Comparative analysis of the PC content using isotopic labeling revealed that in presence of exogenous choline 98% of the total PC was synthesized via the Pcs pathway while the remaining 2% were generated via the PE-methylation (PmtA) pathway. PC species were to a greater extent defined by the Pcs pathway in the outer membrane than in the inner membrane. While no major changes in the bacterial lipid content were observed using 31P NMR, indication for utilization of longer acyl chains and slight increase of PG in response to choline addition was observed by a top-down lipidomics screen. The LL-37 peptide inhibited L. micdadei growth in a dose-dependent manner. Bacteria cultured with exogenous choline were more sensitive to the LL-37 peptide when compared to the standard culture condition. Our biophysical investigations show that the peptide perturbs bacterial-derived phospholipid monolayers and this interaction is dependent on the molar portion of PC. This interaction is responsible for the observed changes in the anti-L. micdadei activity of the LL-37 peptide.

Abstract: The long-chain acyl-CoA synthase1 (Acsl1) is a major enzyme that converts long-chain fatty acids to acyl-CoAs. The role of Acsl1 in energy metabolism has been elucidated in the adipose tissue, heart, and skeletal muscle. Here, we demonstrate that systemic deficiency of Acsl1 caused severe skin barrier defects, leading to embryonic lethality. Acsl1 mRNA and protein are expressed in the Acsl1+/+ epidermis, which are absent in Acsl1−/− mice. In Acsl1−/− mice, epidermal ceramide [EOS] (Cer[EOS]) containing ω-O-esterified linoleic acid, a lipid essential for the skin barrier, was significantly reduced. Conversely, ω-hydroxy ceramide (Cer[OS]), a precursor of Cer[EOS], was increased. Moreover, the levels of triglyceride (TG) species containing linoleic acids were lower in Acsl1−/− mice, whereas those not containing linoleic acid were comparable to Acsl1+/+ mice. As TG is considered to work as a reservoir of linoleic acid for the biosynthesis of Cer[EOS] from Cer[OS], our results suggest that Acsl1 plays an essential role in ω-O-acylceramide synthesis by providing linoleic acid for ω-O-esterification. Therefore, our findings identified a new biological role of Acsl1 as a regulator of the skin barrier.

Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a severe threat to immunocompromised patients due to its numerous virulence factors and biofilm-mediated multidrug resistance. It produces and secretes various toxins with hydrolytic activities including phospholipases. However, the function of intracellular phospholipases for bacterial virulence has still not been established. Here, we demonstrate that the hypothetical gene pa2927 of P. aeruginosa encodes a novel phospholipase B named PaPlaB. At reaction equilibrium, PaPlaB purified from detergent-solubilized membranes of E. coli released fatty acids (FAs) from sn-1 and sn-2 positions of phospholipids at the molar ratio of 51:49. PaPlaB in vitro hydrolyzed P. aeruginosa phospholipids reconstituted in detergent micelles and phospholipids reconstituted in vesicles. Cellular localization studies indicate that PaPlaB is a cell-bound PLA of P. aeruginosa and that it is peripherally bound to both membranes in E. coli, yet the active form was predominantly associated with the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli. Decreasing the concentration of purified and detergent-stabilized PaPlaB leads to increased enzymatic activity, and at the same time triggers oligomer dissociation. We showed that the free FA profile, biofilm amount and architecture of the wild type and ΔplaB differ. However, it remains to be established how the PLB activity of PaPlaB is regulated by homooligomerisation and how it relates to the phenotype of the P. aeruginosa ΔplaB. This novel putative virulence factor contributes to our understanding of phospholipid degrading enzymes and might provide a target for new therapeutics against P. aeruginosa biofilms.

Abstract: Neutrophils are key players in inflammation initiation and resolution. Little attention has been paid to the detailed biosynthesis of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) in these cells. We investigated SPM formation in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL), in broken PMNL preparations and recombinant human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) supplemented with the SPM precursor lipids 15-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), 18-Hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (18-HEPE) or 17-Hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHA). In addition, the influence of 5-LO activating protein (FLAP) inhibition on SPM formation in PMNL was assessed. Intact human PMNL preferred ARA over DHA for lipid mediator formation. In contrast, in incubations supplemented with the SPM precursor lipids DHA-derived 17-HDHA was preferred over 15-HETE and 18-HEPE. SPM formation in the cells was dominated by 5(S),15(S)-diHETE (800 pmol/20 mio cells) and Resolvin D5 (2300 pmol/20 mio cells). Formation of lipoxins (<10 pmol/20 mio cells), E-series (<70 pmol/20 mio cells) and other D-series resolvins (<20 pmol/20 mio cells) was low and only detected after addition of the precursor lipids. Upon destruction of cell integrity, formation of lipoxins and 5(S),15(S)-diHETE increased while formation of 17-HDHA- and 18-HEPE-derived SPMs was attenuated. Recombinant 5-LO did not accept the precursors for SPM formation and FLAP inhibition prevented the formation of the 5-LO-dependent SPMs. Together with the data on FLAP inhibition our results point to unknown factors that control SPM formation in human neutrophils and also render lipoxin and 5(S),15(S)-diHETE formation independent of membrane association and FLAP when cellular integrity is destroyed.

Abstract: Cytidine triphosphate:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-α (CTα) is the rate limiting enzyme in the major pathway for de novo phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis. When CTα is deleted specifically in intestinal epithelial cells of adult mice (CTαIKO mice) fed a high-fat diet they present with weight loss, lipid malabsorption, and high postprandial GLP-1 levels. The current study aimed to characterize the changes that occur in the small intestines of CTαIKO mice using transcriptomics and to determine whether intestinal function could be rescued in CTαIKO mice. We found that impaired de novo PC synthesis in the gut is linked to lower abundance of transcripts related to lipid metabolism and higher abundance of transcripts related to ER stress and cell death, together with loss of goblet cells from the small intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, impaired movement of fatty acids from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes was observed in isolated intestinal sacs derived from CTαIKO mice, a model that excludes factors such as bile, gastric emptying, the nervous system, and circulating hormones. Antibiotic treatment prevented acute weight loss and normalized jejunum TG concentrations after refeeding but did not prevent ER stress or loss of goblet cells in CTαIKO mice. Dietary PC supplementation partially prevented loss of goblet cells but was unable to normalize jejunal TG concentrations after refeeding in CTαIKO mice. High postprandial plasma GLP-1 levels were present in CTαIKO mice regardless of antibiotic treatment, dietary PC content, or dietary fat content. Together, these data show that there is a specific requirement from de novo PC synthesis in maintaining small intestinal homeostasis, including dietary lipid uptake, normal hormone secretion, and barrier function.

Abstract: Fatty acids (FAs) longer than C20 are classified as very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Although biosynthesis and degradation of VLCFAs are important for the development and integrity of the myelin sheath, knowledge on the incorporation of extracellular VLCFAs into the cells is limited due to the experimental difficulty of solubilizing them. In this study, we found that a small amount of isopropanol solubilized VLCFAs in aqueous medium by facilitating the formation of the VLCFA/albumin complex. Using this solubilizing technique, we examined the role of the peroxisome in the uptake and metabolism of VLCFAs in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. When wild-type CHO cells were incubated with saturated VLCFAs (S-VLCFAs), such as C23:0 FA, C24:0 FA, and C26:0 FA, extensive uptake was observed. Most of the incorporated S-VLCFAs were oxidatively degraded without acylation into cellular lipids. In contrast, in peroxisome-deficient CHO cells uptake of S-VLCFAs was marginal and oxidative metabolism was not observed. Extensive uptake and acylation of monounsaturated (MU)-VLCFAs, such as C24:1 FA and C22:1 FA, were observed in both types of CHO cells. However, oxidative metabolism was evident only in wild-type cells. Similar manners of uptake and metabolism of S-VLCFAs and MU-VLCFAs were observed in IFRS1, a Schwan cell-derived cell line. These results indicate that peroxisome-deficient cells limit intracellular S-VLCFAs at a low level by halting uptake, and as a result, peroxisome-deficient cells almost completely lose the clearance ability of S-VLCFAs accumulated outside of the cells.

Abstract: Phospholipase D (PLD) generates the signaling lipid phosphatidic acid (PA) and has been known to mediate proliferation signal in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However, it remains unclear how PLD contributes to vascular diseases. VSMC proliferation directly contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty. Using the mouse carotid artery ligation model, we find that deletion of Pld1 gene inhibits neointima formation of the injuried blood vessels. PLD1 deficiency reduces the proliferation of VSMCs in both injured artery and primary cultures through the inhibition of ERK1/2 and AKT signals. Immunohistochemical staining of injured artery and flow cytometry analysis of VSMCs shows a reduction of the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Pld1−/− VSMCs. An increase of intracellular ROS by hydrogen peroxide stimulation restored the reduced activities of ERK and AKT in Pld1−/− VSMCs, whereas a reduction of ROS by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) scavenger lowered their activity in wild-type VSMCs. These results indicate that PLD1 plays a critical role in neointima, and that PLD1 mediates VSMC proliferation signal through promoting the production of ROS. Therefore, inhibition of PLD1 may be used as a therapeutic approach to suppress neointimal formation in atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty.

Abstract: Triacylglycerols are a major source of stored energy that are obtained either from the diet or can be synthesized to some extent by most tissues. Alterations in pathways of triacylglycerol metabolism can result in their excessive accumulation leading to obesity, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Most tissues in mammals synthesize triacylglycerols via the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway. However, in the small intestine the monoacylglycerol acyltransferase pathway is the predominant pathway for triacylglycerol biosynthesis where it participates in the absorption of dietary triacylglycerol. In this review, the enzymes that are part of both the glycerol 3-phosphate and monoacylglycerol acyltransferase pathways and their contributions to intestinal triacylglycerol metabolism are reviewed. The potential of some of the enzymes involved in triacylglycerol synthesis in the small intestine as possible therapeutic targets for treating metabolic disorders associated with elevated triacylglycerol is briefly discussed.

Abstract: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl esters are of interest given their clinical approval for lowering circulating triglycerides and cardiometabolic disease risk. EPA ethyl esters prevent metabolic complications driven by a high fat diet in male mice; however, their impact on female mice is less studied. Herein, we first investigated how EPA influences the metabolic profile of female C57BL/6J mice consuming a high fat diet. EPA lowered murine fat mass accumulation, potentially through increased biosynthesis of 8-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (HEPE), as revealed by mass spectrometry and cell culture studies. EPA also reversed the effects of a high fat diet on circulating levels of insulin, glucose, and select inflammatory/metabolic markers. Next, we studied if the improved metabolic profile of obese mice consuming EPA was associated with a reduction in the abundance of key gut Gram-negative bacteria that contribute toward impaired glucose metabolism. Using fecal 16S-ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we found EPA restructured the gut microbiota in a time-dependent manner but did not lower the levels of key Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, EPA robustly increased the abundance of the Gram-negative Akkermansia muciniphila, which controls glucose homeostasis. Finally, predictive functional profiling of microbial communities revealed EPA-mediated reversal of high fat diet-associated changes in a wide range of genes related to pathways such as Th-17 cell differentiation and PI3K-Akt signaling. Collectively, these results show that EPA ethyl esters prevent some of the deleterious effects of a high fat diet in female mice, which may be mediated mechanistically through 8-HEPE and the upregulation of intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila.

Abstract: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a disease with symptoms similar to those of alcoholic liver inflammation without alcohol intake. As an effective treatment strategy has not been established for this disease, a detailed understanding of the pathological progression mechanism is required. We focused on cholesterol metabolites, which are suspected to regulate NASH pathology, and investigated their relationship with the pathological progression in the early stages of NASH. First, the LC/MS/MS methods for bile acids and sterols were optimized and validated. Next, NASH model mice were established by feeding a choline-deficient, methionine-reduced high-fat diet, and the levels of hepatic cholesterol metabolites were measured. As a result, before the onset of NASH, desmosterol, 4β-hydroxycholesterol, campesterol, sitosterol, secondary bile acids such as taurodeoxycholic acid significantly decreased by up to 1/38 of NASH model group. Autoxidation-generated sterols significantly increased 2- to 5-fold, and various primary bile acids such as conjugated β-muricholic acids and cholic acids significantly increased 2- to 7-fold. In this study, the levels of cholesterol metabolites changed in the before the onset of NASH. These metabolic alterations involved in inflammation induction and detoxification for NASH may help the discovery of early diagnostic biomarkers in the future.

Abstract: Glycerophospholipids are major components of cell membranes and have enormous variation in the composition of fatty acyl chains esterified on the sn-1 and sn-2 position as well as the polar head groups on the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes constitute a superfamily of enzymes which play a critical role in metabolism and signal transduction by hydrolyzing the sn-2 acyl chains of glycerophospholipids. In human cell membranes, in addition to the conventional diester phospholipids, a significant amount is the sn-1 ether-linked phospholipids which play a critical role in numerous biological activities. However, precisely how PLA2s distinguish the sn-1 acyl chain linkage is not understood. In the present study, we expanded the technique of lipidomics to determine the unique in vitro specificity of three major human PLA2s, including Group IVA cytosolic cPLA2, Group VIA calcium-independent iPLA2, and Group V secreted sPLA2 toward the linkage at the sn-1 position. Interestingly, cPLA2 prefers sn-1 vinyl ether phospholipids known as plasmalogens over conventional ester phospholipids and the sn-1 alkyl ether phospholipids. iPLA2 showed similar activity toward vinyl ether and ester phospholipids at the sn-1 position. Surprisingly, sPLA2 preferred ester phospholipids over alkyl and vinyl ether phospholipids. By taking advantage of molecular dynamics simulations, we found that Trp30 in the sPLA2 active site dominates its specificity for diester phospholipids.

Abstract: Cyp2c70−/− mice with a human-like bile acid (BA) composition, lacking hydrophilic muricholic acids (MCAs), have been reported to display cholangiopathy and biliary fibrosis with female preponderance that can be reversed by ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Obeticholic acid (OCA), a steroidal BA-like FXR agonist, has been shown to improve liver function in patients with primary biliary cholangitis and is approved as second-line treatment for patients with an inadequate response or intolerance to UDCA. Here, we investigated the impact of OCA on BA hydrophobicity and cholangiopathy in Cyp2c70−/− mice. Male and female wild-type (WT) and Cyp2c70−/− mice were fed a chow diet with or without 10 mg/kg/day OCA for 4 weeks. OCA accounted for 1–5% of biliary BAs, with larger enrichments in Cyp2c70−/− than in WT mice. In WT mice, OCA induced a more hydrophilic, MCA-rich BA pool. In Cyp2c70−/− mice, however, BA pool became more hydrophobic with a larger proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid, attributable to a reduction of BA 12α-hydroxylation. OCA treatment reduced fecal BA excretion, indicating repression of hepatic BA synthesis in both WT and Cyp2c70−/− mice. OCA did, however, not impact on markers of liver (dys)function in plasma nor did it ameliorate cholangiopathy and fibrosis in male or female Cyp2c70−/− mice. OCA treatment also did not affect the expression of genes involved in fibrosis, inflammation and cellular senescence. In conclusion, 4 weeks of OCA treatment oppositely modulates the hydrophobicity of the BA pool in WT and Cyp2c70−/− mice, but does not improve or worsen the characteristic sex-dependent liver pathology in Cyp2c70−/− mice.

Abstract: Cholesterol in the circulation is mostly transported in an esterified form as a component of lipoproteins. The majority of these cholesteryl esters are produced in nascent, discoidal high density lipoproteins (HDLs) by the enzyme, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Discoidal HDLs are discrete populations of particles that consist of a phospholipid bilayer, the hydrophobic acyl chains of which are shielded from the aqueous environment by apolipoproteins that also confer water solubility on the particles. The progressive LCAT-mediated accumulation of cholesteryl esters in discoidal HDLs generates the spherical HDLs that predominate in normal human plasma. Spherical HDLs contain a core of water insoluble, neutral lipids (cholesteryl esters and triglycerides) that is surrounded by a surface monolayer of phospholipids with which apolipoproteins associate. Although spherical HDLs all have the same basic structure, they are extremely diverse in size, composition, and function. This review is concerned with how the biogenesis of discoidal and spherical HDLs is regulated and the mechanistic basis of their size and compositional heterogeneity. Current understanding of the impact of this heterogeneity on the therapeutic potential of HDLs of varying size and composition is also addressed in the context of several disease states.

Abstract: High-density lipoproteins (HDL) play a key role in cholesterol homeostasis maintenance in the central nervous system (CNS), by carrying newly synthesized cholesterol from astrocytes to neurons, to support their lipid-related physiological functions. As occurs for plasma HDL, brain lipoproteins are assembled through the activity of membrane cholesterol transporters, undergo remodeling mediated by specific enzymes and transport proteins, and finally deliver cholesterol to neurons by a receptor-mediated internalization process. A growing number of evidences indicates a strong association between alterations of CNS cholesterol homeostasis and neurodegenerative disorders, in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a possible role in this relationship may be played by defects in brain HDL metabolism. In the present review, we summarize and critically examine the current state of knowledge on major modifications of HDL and HDL-mediated brain cholesterol transport in AD, by taking into consideration the individual steps of this process. We also describe potential and encouraging HDL-based therapies that could represent new therapeutic strategies for AD treatment. Finally, we revise the main plasma and brain HDL modifications in other neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

Abstract: Ablation of the gene encoding the nuclear receptor Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4a (Hnf4a) in the liver strongly affects HDL concentration, structure and functionality but the role of this receptor in the intestine, the second organ contributing to serum HDL levels, has been overlooked. In the present study we show that mice with intestine-specific ablation of Hnf4a (H4IntKO) had undetectable levels of ΗΝF4A in ileum, proximal and distal colon but normal expression in liver. H4IntKO mice presented normal serum lipid levels, HDL-C and particle size (α1-α3). The expression of the major HDL biogenesis genes Apoa1, Abca1, Lcat was not affected but there was significant increase in Apoc3 as well as in Hnf4g, a paralog of Hnf4a. RNA-sequencing identified metabolic pathways significantly affected by Hnf4a ablation such as type II diabetes, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and p53 signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that HNF4G bound to various apolipoprotein gene promoters in control mice but its binding affinity was reduced in the ileum of H4IntKO mice suggesting a redundancy but also a cooperation between the two factors. In the distal colon of H4IntKO mice, where both HNF4A and HNF4G are absent and in a mouse model of DSS-induced colitis presenting decreased levels of HNF4A, most lipoprotein genes were strongly downregulated. In conclusion, Hnf4a ablation in mice does not significantly affect serum lipid levels or lipoprotein gene expression in ileum possibly due to compensatory effects by its paralog Hnf4g in this tissue.

Abstract: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictive peptide produced and secreted mainly by endothelial cells. Recent studies indicate that ET-1 can regulate lipid metabolism, which may increase the risk of insulin resistance. Our previous studies revealed that ET-1 induced lipolysis in adipocytes, but the underlying mechanisms were unclear. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used to investigate the effect of ET-1 on lipolysis and the underlying mechanisms. Glycerol levels in the incubation medium and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation were used as indices for lipolysis. ET-1 significantly increased HSL phosphorylation and lipolysis, which were completely inhibited by ERK inhibitor (PD98059) and guanylyl cyclase (GC) inhibitor (LY83583). LY83583 reduced ET-1-induced ERK phosphorylation. A Ca2+-free medium and PLC inhibitor caused significant decreases in ET-1-induced lipolysis as well as ERK and HSL phosphorylation, and IP3 receptor activator (D-IP3) increased lipolysis. ET-1 increased cGMP production, which was not affected by depletion of extracellular Ca2+. On the other hand, LY83583 diminished the ET-1-induced Ca2+ influx. Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV-1) antagonist and shRNA partially inhibited ET-1-induced lipolysis. ET-1-induced lipolysis was completely suppressed by CaMKIII inhibitor (NH-125). These results indicate that ET-1 stimulates extracellular Ca2+ entry and activates the intracellular PLC/IP3/Ca2+ pathway through a cGMP-dependent pathway. The increased cytosolic Ca2+ that results from ET-1 treatment stimulates ERK and HSL phosphorylation, which subsequently induces lipolysis. ET-1 induces HSL phosphorylation and lipolysis via the GC/cGMP/Ca2+/ERK/CaMKIII signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Abstract: Glycolipids are now known to be rapidly converted to mediators for inflammatory reactions or to signaling molecules that control inflammatory events in the nervous system. The present study aimed to explore whether disturbed glycolipids metabolism in the nervous system is present in patients with a neuroinflammatory disorder, encephalo-myelo-radiculo-neuropathy (EMRN), because most EMRN patients have been reported to exhibit autoantibodies against neutral glycolipids. Although molecular pathogenesis of this disorder remains unknown, we tried to search the immunochemical abnormalities in this disorder. ELISA for activated peripheral C5 complement and mass spectrometry analysis of cerebrospinal fluid clearly disclosed a significant upregulation of active C5 complement, C5a levels in sera as well as a significant accumulation of species-specific ceramides but not sphingomyelin in cerebrospinal fluid from EMRN patients. Furthermore, we confirmed the occurrence of anti-neutral glycolipids antibodies in all EMRN patients. Thus, the present study might indicate the pathophysiology of this disorder is the dysregulation of glycolipids metabolism and abnormal production of autoantibodies against neutral glycolipids resulting in the abnormal complement activation, although molecular basis for these sphingolipids dysregulation and the occurrence of autoantibodies against glycolipids remains to be elucidated at present. The present study implicates a new therapeutic strategy employing anti-ceramide and/or anti-complement therapy for this disorder.
