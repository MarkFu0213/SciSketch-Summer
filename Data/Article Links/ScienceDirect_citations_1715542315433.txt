Abstract: Sorption heat storage (SHS) is a promising technology towards efficient use of renewable energy sources. Composite materials based on hygroscopic salts have a high potential for SHS in term of the heat storage capacity. Recently, a new sorbent “LiCl confined to Multi-Wall Carbon NanoTubes (MWCNT)” with enhanced storage capacity (1.7kJ/g) has been suggested for SHS. This work addresses the dynamic study of water sorption on this material under operating conditions of a daily heat storage cycle. The study consists of three parts: (1) shaping the LiCl/MWCNT composite as grains (GP) and pellets with (PB) and without a binder (PP); (2) water sorption dynamics under conditions of the selected SHS cycle; (3) evaluation of the specific power achievable. Various configurations of the adsorbent bed were tested, namely, the loose grains GP placed on a metal support, and the pellets PB and PP glued to the support. The dynamic curves of water sorption obey an exponential equation. The PB configuration ensured a maximal specific power of 11.2kW/kg (at 70% conversion) during the heat storage stage. During the heat release stage, the specific power is lower (5.4kW/kg), probably due to a kinetic hindrance attributed to solid-solid transformation during the decomposition of LiCl·H2O complex towards the anhydrous salt. The high specific power along with the large heat storage capacity make the LiCl/MWCNT composite a promising new candidate for SHS.

Abstract: Nanoparticulate organic films are an attractive area of organic photovoltaic (OPV) research given their potential for controlling active layer morphology on the nanoscale. However, the power conversion efficiency of these devices remains limited in comparison to the analogous bulk heterojunction technology. Here, we report a systematic characterisation of charge carrier loss pathways in nanoparticulate OPVs prepared using poly(3-hexylthiophene) as a donor and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester as an acceptor material. Optical modelling of the nanoparticle active layer morphology indicates minimal losses from scattering and negligible plasmon effects from the discrete 40nm particles. A comparison of the modelled internal absorption for the nanoparticle films confirms negligible differences in comparison to a standard bulk heterojunction active layer structure. By contrast, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE), determined with the aid of optically modelled internal active layer and parasitic non-active layer absorption, exhibited values of 24% for the nanoparticle device whilst the bulk heterojunction showed a value of 76%. Subsequent modelling of the EQE and IQE (supported by photoluminescence quenching measurements) indicated an exciton dissociation yield of 24% for nanoparticulate devices in comparison to 81% for the corresponding bulk heterojunction, in excellent agreement with the device internal quantum efficiencies. Transient measurements of charge transport and bimolecular recombination lifetime revealed a charge carrier drift length longer than the film thickness at short circuit conditions for both device structures. Impedance spectroscopy measurements confirmed very low photoinduced chemical capacitances at short circuit and returned charge collection efficiencies in excess of 80% for both devices, suggesting only minor charge collection losses in either device at short circuit. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the dominant photocurrent loss mechanism in nanoparticulate OPVs is a poor charge generation yield rather than reduced light absorption, increased bimolecular recombination or charge extraction barriers.

Abstract: Preparing dense organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite film is hindered by the extremely low solubility of lead(II) iodide (PbI2) at one-step coating process using one-solution (PbI2 + CH3NH3I + DMF). Thus, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been widely used to enhance the solubility through the formation of adducts. However, the required mixture of DMSO and DMF cannot be simultaneously evaporated at low temperatures, owing to the different boiling points, which are influenced by the surface morphology. Consequently, this also affects the solar energy conversion efficiency of the perovskite solar cells. In this study, we develop a new approach for controlling the evaporation of DMF and DMSO by dip-coating ether on the top of the prepared thin film composed of PbI2, methylammonium iodide (MAI), DMF, and DMSO. Interestingly, it reveals that ether acted as an agent for simultaneous evaporation at similar temperatures, which then allows it to control surface morphology, and achieve dense perovskite. The fabricated inverted-perovskite PbI2 thin film solar cell shows that the efficiency reached up to 16.3% with high reproducibility. The ether-dipping post-treatment serves as a promising means for enhancing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: The screen-printed aluminium back surface field (Al-BSF) technology is the current industry standard process for crystalline silicon solar cells but, due to the search for higher efficiency, much attention has been paid to the passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC), which is gaining significant share in the world market. We undertake an environmental analysis comparing Al-BSF and PERC monocrystalline solar modules. Through the life cycle assessment (LCA) method we calculate the global warming, human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer effects), freshwater eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, abiotic depletion potentials and energy payback time of these technologies considering solar, electronic and upgraded metallurgical grade silicon feedstock. The functional unit considered is 1 kWh of energy delivered over the modules’ lifetime. As a result of this work, we showed that PERC technology generates a slight improvement in the environmental impacts when compared with Al-BSF. The use of electronic and upgraded metallurgical grade silicon results in lower environmental impacts in most cases, compared with the other technologies analysed, based on the assumptions made in this LCA.

Abstract: A well-known but heretofore uncharacterized failure mechanism in multijunction photovoltaic cells involves the development of cracks in the top cell directly adjacent to metal gridline structures. In this study, we systematically explore the potential evolution of stress, grain size, roughness, and hardness of metal gridlines during thermal cycling as it pertains to top cell cracking behavior. We discover that although top cells are found to crack after many cycles, this is not due to an accumulation of stress or damage, but rather a progression of strain hardening within the metal gridlines due to cyclic plastic deformations, quantified as an increase in hardness of as much as 57%. Furthermore, optical and topological characterization reveals morphology changes at the gridlines’ top surfaces, lending some insight to commonly observed bus bar wire-bonding issues. Ultimately this suite of characterization techniques not only reveals the underlying behavior leading to gridline-induced top cell cracking failures in multijunction photovoltaics, but also suggests a route forward for the development of improved gridline materials.

Abstract: Myoblast differentiation is a highly complex process that is regulated by proteins as well as by non-coding RNAs. Circular RNAs have been identified as an emerging new class of non-coding RNA in the modulation of skeletal muscle development, whereas their expression profiles and functional regulation in myoblast differentiation remain unknown. In the present study, we performed deep RNA-sequencing of C2C12 myoblasts during cell differentiation and uncovered 37,751 unique circular RNAs derived from 6943 hosting genes. The ensuing qRT-PCR and RNA ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization verification were carried out to confirm the RNA-sequencing results. An unbiased analysis demonstrated dynamic circular RNA expression changes in the process of myoblast differentiation, and the circular RNA abundances were independent from their cognate linear RNAs. Gene ontology analysis showed that many down-regulated circular RNAs were exclusive to cell division and the cell cycle, whereas up-regulated circular RNAs were related to the cell development process. Furthermore, interaction networks of circular RNA-microRNA were constructed. Several microRNAs well-known for myoblast regulation, such as miR-133, miR-24 and miR-23a, were in this network. In summary, this study showed that circular RNA expression dynamics changed during myoblast differentiation. Circular RNAs play a role in regulating the myoblast cell cycle and development by acting as microRNA binding sites to facilitate their regulation of gene expression during myoblast differentiation. These findings open a new avenue for future investigation of this emerging RNA class in skeletal muscle growth and development.

Abstract: InAs/GaAs quantum dot solar cell structures have been grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy, using partial capping of the quantum dots plus a subsequent thermal anneal. The optical characteristics of the InAs quantum dot layers have been studied as a function of the GaAs capping layer thickness and annealing temperature. We observe that a thinner capping layer and a higher annealing temperature result in lower non-radiative defect density and in improved quantum dot size homogeneity, leading to intense and sharp photoluminescence emission at low temperatures. We use an effective mass approximation model to correlate the photoluminescence emission characteristics to the quantum dot composition and dimensions. The resulting InAs/GaAs intermediate band solar cells show the best performance for the case of a 3 nm thick capping layer and annealing at 700 °C.

Abstract: Trichomonas vaginalis genome encodes ∼440 proteases, six of which are aspartic proteases (APs). However, only one belongs to a clan AA (EC 3.4.23.5), family A1 (pepsin A), cathepsin D-like protease. This AP is encoded by an 1113-bp gene (tv-catd), which translates into a 370-aa residues zymogen of 40.7-kDa and a theoretical pI of 4.6, generating a ∼35 kDa active enzyme after maturation (Tv-CatD). The goal of this study was to identify and analyze the effect of glucose on the expression of Tv-CatD at the transcript and protein levels, subcellular localization, and proteolytic activity. The qRT-PCR assays showed a ∼2-fold increase in tv-catd mRNA under high-glucose (HG) conditions compared to glucose-restriction (GR) conditions. We amplified, cloned, and expressed the tv-catd gene, and purified the recombinant precursor enzyme (Tv-CatDr) to generate a polyclonal antibody (anti-Tv-CatDr). Western blot (WB) and immunolocalization assays showed that glucose increases the amount of Tv-CatD in different subcellular localizations and in in vitro secretions. Additionally, Tv-CatD proteolytic activity was detected in protease-resistant extracts (PREs) using a synthetic fluorogenic peptide specific for cathepsin D/E APs at different pHs and in the presence of AP inhibitors. In a two-dimensional (2-DE) WB analysis of a PRE from parasites grown under GR and HG conditions, an anti-Tv-CatDr antibody detected a 35-kDa protein spot at pI 5.0 identified as the mature Tv-CatD form by mass spectrometry that showed proteolytic activity in 2-DE zymograms copolymerized with hemoglobin under both glucose conditions. Thus, Tv-CatD could be involved in trichomonal hemolysis.

Abstract: Organometallic halide perovskite materials have attracted great attention in the past few years owing to their excellent optical properties and solution-processable fabrication. However, the further development of these lead-based materials is restricted by the toxic heavy-metal element Pb. Herein, we present a dissolution-recrystallization method to fabricate high-quality lead-free Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanosheets film and further explore its potential application in solar cells with three different kinds of hole transport materials. The solar cells based on ultrathin Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets show remarkable improvement in the photovoltaic performance and a high power conversion efficiency of 3.20% has been achieved in the solar cell with CuI as the hole transport material, which is the highest efficiency value of Bi-based perovskite solar cells that has been reported so far. The Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets based solar cell with CuI also showed a long-term stability in ambient air. These encouraging results of our work demonstrate the possibility of further improvement of the performance of lead-free perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) has recently revealed as a candidate tumor suppressor gene. To inhibit tumor growth and decrease morbidity of esophageal cancer (EC), this study aims to test the hypothesis that the upregulation of NDRG2 may suppress proliferation, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of EC cells by regulating the AKT/XIAP signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry was conducted for the identification of NDRG2, protein kinase B (p-AKT), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in EC tissues. To identify the regulatory mechanism of NDRG2 on the AKT/XIAP signaling pathway and EMT in EC, over-expressed lentiviral vector and shRNA were applied for up-regulating and interfering NDRG2 expression, and a series of determinations on the biological behavior of EC cells were performed to validate this regulation action. The results of immunohistochemistry showed NDRG2 was lowly expressed in EC tissues while p-AKT and XIAP are highly expressed. Over-expression of NDRG2 suppresses the proteins related to AKT/XIAP signaling pathway and EMT. Besides, a series of determinations shows the proliferation, migration and invasion of TE-13 cells were suppressed by over-expressed NDRG2, while the cell cycle progression was blocked and cell apoptosis was promoted. And in vivo experiment also demonstrated NDRG2 could inhibit tumor growth. Our findings demonstrate over-expression of NDRG2 works as tumor suppressive role in EC through its effects on inhibition of cell migration, invasion, and EMT by inhibiting the AKT/XIAP signaling pathway.

Abstract: The dysregulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has increasingly been linked to human gastric cancer (GC). However, the LINC01606 expression level and clinical values, and its role in the molecular mechanism underlying GC remain largely unknown. In our research, we found that LINC010606 was elevated aberrantly and correlated with metastasis and invasion in GC patients. Moreover, we found that LINC01606 expression level was associated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In addition, subsequent functional experiments showed that JW74, a specific Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor, inhibited the transcription of LINC01606 and suppressed migration and invasion in GC cell lines. We also revealed that LINC01606 might be associated with miR-423-5p to regulate the level to which the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated. In summary, the findings of this study, based on competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) theory, combine new data on the interaction between miR-423-5p and Wnt3a and introduce LINC01606 as a new focus for research, thus providing new insight into possible molecular-level approaches to preventing the migration and invasion of GC.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is a low cost, non-toxic material composed of earth-abundant elements with a large optical absorption coefficient. However, in CZTS solar cells, CdS buffer layers are widely used, which contain toxic elements and lead to lattice mismatch with CZTS thin films. In this paper, we have systematically investigated a I-II-IV-VI semiconductor material to replace the CdS buffer layer with a non-toxic material that offers good lattice matching with the CZTS film. For the first time, Cd-free Cu2ZnSnS4-Ag2ZnSnS4 heterojunction photovoltaic device is fabricated, where Cu2ZnSnS4 and Ag2ZnSnS4 layers are obtained by co-sputtering method. The cell exhibits a 4.51% efficiency which is higher than those of CZTS solar cells with ZnS and In2S3 buffer layers. This work offers the possibility to realize environmentally benign, scalable, low-cost, and high-efficiency solar cells.

Abstract: Solar Salt-based nanofluids have attracted significant scientific interest in recent years due to their improved thermal properties, making them strong candidates as thermal energy storage materials and/or heat transfer fluids in CSP plants. There have been reports on increased specific heat due to the addition of nanoparticles, however, there is a lack of comprehensive information on other essential properties affecting the heat transfer, such as the viscosity. This article concerns the rheological behaviour of nanofluids made of Solar Salt (mass percentage at 60% NaNO3 – 40% KNO3) as the base fluid and silica or alumina nanoparticles as additives. The evolution of these nanofluids viscosity as a function of the shear rate (1–1000s−1) at a temperature range of 250–400°C was measured and analysed. The impact of the salt purity (refined or industrial grade), the nanoparticle concentration (0.5–1.5wt%) and the rheometer measuring configuration (coaxial cylinder or parallel plate) are examined. The results showed in general a Newtonian behaviour of the nanofluids with independency of the rheometer configuration. The relationship between the viscosity and the temperature follows an Arrhenius model. The influence of the nanoparticle concentration on the viscosity of the refined grade Solar Salt is analysed according to the Maron-Pierce and Kriegher-Dougherty models for the nanofluids containing alumina and silica nanoparticles respectively, due to their different shape.

Abstract: We investigate the possibility to combine Zn(O,S) buffer layers grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) with KF post-deposition treated Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS-KF) in solar cells. It is shown that the beneficial effect on open-circuit voltage from the post-deposition treatment is essentially independent of buffer layer material. However, a wet-chemical surface treatment is required prior to ALD in order to achieve competitive fill factor values. A water rinse is sufficient to create an absorber surface similar to the one formed during a conventional CdS chemical bath deposition process. However, it is observed that CIGS-KF/Zn(O,S) devices made with water-rinsed absorbers systematically result in lower fill factor values than for the corresponding CIGS-KF/CdS references. This effect can be mitigated by decreasing the H2S:H2O precursor ratio during ALD initiation, indicating that the fill factor limitation is linked to the initial Zn(O,S) growth on the modified CIGS-KF surface. The best CIGS-KF/Zn(O,S) devices were fabricated by etching away the KF-modified surface layer prior to ALD, followed by a low-temperature anneal. The thermal treatment step is needed to increase the open-circuit voltage close to the value of the CdS devices. The results presented in this contribution indicate that the main beneficial effects from KF-PDT in our devices are neither associated with the CdS CBD process nor due to the formation of a K-In-Se rich phase on the CIGS surface.

Abstract: Accurate measurements of bulk minority carrier lifetime are essential in order to determine the true limit of silicon's performance and to improve solar cell production processes. The thin film which forms when silicon wafers are dipped in solutions containing superacids such as bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (TFSI) has recently been found to be effective at electronically passivating the silicon surface. In this paper we first study the role of the solvent in which TFSI is dissolved for the passivation process. We study ten solvents with a wide range of relative polarities, finding TFSI dissolved in hexane provides improved temporal stability, marginally better passivation and improved solution longevity compared to dichloroethane which has been used previously. Sample storage conditions, particularly humidity, can strongly influence the passivation stability. The optimised TFSI-hexane passivation scheme is then applied to a set of 3 Ω cm n-type wafers cut from the same float-zone ingot to have different thicknesses. This enables the reproducibility of the scheme to be systematically evaluated. At 1015 cm−3 injection the best case effective surface recombination velocity is 0.69 ± 0.04 cm/s, with bulk lifetimes measured up to the intrinsic lifetime limit at high injection and >43 ms at lower injection. Immersion of silicon in superacid-based ionic solutions therefore provides excellent surface passivation, and, as it is applied at room temperature, the effects on true bulk lifetime are minimal.

Abstract: Fabrication of most-promising CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cell in ambient condition is excessively essential to industrialize this revolutionary development. In this research work, an efficient, facile and economical technique has been developed to fabricate CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell in ambient condition which is termed as dual-step thermal engineering technique. In this dual-step thermal engineering technique, the perovskite precursor solution has been spin coated over a mildly hot substrate which was heated at 60 ⁰C for 10 min and followed by annealing at 80 °C for 30 min immediately after spin coating and compared with the perovskite film fabricated by conventional annealing in which the film was heated once at 120 °C for 60 min after spin coating. The comparative study shows that the newly developed dual-step thermal engineering technique is highly efficient and forms smooth, dense, well-crystallize, almost pinhole free perovskite solar cell at open air condition and exhibit remarkable enhanced efficiency over conventional annealing. This is because the precursor solution spontaneously started to develop a perovskite layer over the substrate during spin coating similarly as epitaxial-growth by utilizing the kinetic energy of the hot substrate and it serves as foundation layer for the high quality device.

Abstract: Carbon-doped KNbO3 photocatalyst was synthesized for the first time via a simple combination of hydrothermal and post-calcination processes with glucose as the carbon source. The synthesized sample had excellent performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production under simulated sunlight. Various techniques were applied to investigate the origin of the extraordinary photocatalytic activity. X-ray diffraction and Ar+ sputtering X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses proved that carbon atom was successfully doped into the lattice of KNbO3. Scanning electron microscopy and N2 adsorption analysis indicated that the particle size of KNbO3 was decreased due to the doping of carbon, which resulted in the increase of the BET surface area. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy experiment verified that the carbon doping extended the light absorption region to visible light. Both the changes in surface area and optical property are beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction. However, the stronger H2 generation rate of carbon-doped KNbO3 was mostly attributed to the enhanced separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs due to the presence of carbon dopant. The promotion effect is closely correlated with the content of carbon dopant. C-KNbO3 sample calcined at 350 °C displayed the highest hydrogen generation rate of 211 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 42 times higher than that of pure KNbO3. Additionally, the synthesized carbon-doped KNbO3 also presented good photoactivity under visible-light illumination. This study provides a feasible way for the synthesis of other similar photocatalysts with high efficiency.

Abstract: If the ratio of two open circuit photoluminescence (Voc-PL) images taken at two different light intensities is displayed, some grain boundaries (GBs) may show up as bright lines. This indicates that these special GBs show distinct injection intensity-dependent recombination properties. It will be shown here that this results in an apparent ideality factor of the light emission smaller than unity. The effect is reproduced with numerical device simulations using a usual distribution of defects in the band gap along grain boundaries. Quantitative imaging of this apparent luminescence ideality factor by PL imaging is complicated by the lateral horizontal balancing currents flowing at open circuit. The local voltage response of an inhomogeneous solar cell at different injection levels under open circuit is modelled by Griddler simulations, based on PL investigations of this cell. The evaluation of Voc-PL images at different illumination intensities allows us to conclude that the apparent luminescence ideality factor at the special GBs is about 0.89, whereas in the other regions it is between 0.94 and 0.95. Reverse bias electroluminescence showed no pre-breakdown sites, and hyperspectral PL imaging showed only in one of the investigated GBs particular defect luminescence. TEM investigations of two GBs, one showing distinct injection intensity-dependent recombination and the other one showing none, revealed that the investigated special GB is a large-angle GB whereas the GB not showing this effect is a small-angle GB.

Abstract: Inner ear hair cells are mechanoreceptors responsible for hearing. Pathogenic defects of hair cell-specific genes are one of the major causes of deafness. The BarH class homeobox gene Barhl1 is a deafness gene expressed in developing hair cells, yet the role of Barhl1 during hair cell development remains poorly understood. In the present study, we first established an in vitro differentiation system to efficiently obtain mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived hair cell-like cells. Subsequently, a mESC line carrying a targeted disruption of Barhl1 was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and subjected to the established in vitro hair cell differentiation protocol. Targeted disruption of Barhl1 does not affect the induction of mESCs toward early primitive ectoderm-like (EPL) cells and otic progenitors but strongly inhibits the differentiation of hair cell-like cells. Using RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics, we further unravel the molecular mechanism underlying Barhl1-mediated hair cell development. Our data demonstrate the essential role of Barhl1 during hair cell development and provide a basis for the treatment of Barhl1 mutation-based deafness.

Abstract: Background
Resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy becomes a major obstacle in lung cancer treatment. Compensatory activation of nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is the major mechanism accounting for cisplatin-resistance. We aimed at identifying additional regulators in NER-mediated chemoresistance in a hypoxic setting induced by sodium glycididazole (CMNa)-sensitized cisplatin chemotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Methods
We performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis to identify the genes whose expression had been differentially regulated in NER-deficient cells that had been treated by cisplatin/CMNa. DNA damage, apoptosis, and correlational analysis between the differentially expressed gene and drug sensitivity were determined by Western blots, flow cytometry and Oncomine expression analysis.
Results
The stress response gene, NDRG1 (N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 1), was among the differentially expressed genes in NER-deficient cells upon treatment of cisplatin/CMNa. Downregulation of NDRG1 by ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementing 1) could be a prevalent mechanism for drug resistance. Furthermore, lower NDRG1 level is observed in human lung cancer cells showing chemotherapeutic drug resistance compared with the drug-sensitive cells.
Conclusion
NDRG1 is an important modulator linking DNA damage response and hypoxia-related cellular stress response during the development of drug resistance to cisplatin/CMNa in lung cancer. Targeting both NDRG1 and ERCC1 may be a viable strategy for overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy, and has significant clinical implications.

Abstract: Herein, 1,6-Diaminohexane Dihydrochloride (1,6-DD) is introduced into perovskite precursors to fabricate the inverted planar perovskite solar cells. By regulating the concentration of 1,6-DD additive, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells is enhanced by 20%. The champion device achieves a relatively high PCE of 17% and an excellent fill factor of 80.1%. The PCE of the large-area (1 cm2) device also reaches to 13.68%. After exposure to the air for 16 days, the device with 1,6-DD additive still retains above 90% of the initial efficiency, exhibiting good stability. We demonstrate that a small amount of 1,6-DD affects the crystallization dynamic, yielding ideal perovskite film with enhanced crystallinity and enlarged grain size. The two terminal -NH3+ groups passivates the vacancy defects at the perovskite crystal surface, suppressing charge recombination and facilitating charge transportation effectively. Meanwhile, adjacent crystal surfaces are linked through the hexane alkyl chain of 1,6-DD molecule, which enhances the interaction between perovskite grains and anchors the microstructure of perovskite to some degree. Hydrophobic hexane alkyl chains also increase the moisture resistance of perovskite film. Thus, an easy and effective way is provided for fabricating efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Objective/background
Anti-T lymphocyte globulin Fresenius (rATG-F; ATG-Fresenius) and antithymocyte globulin (thymoglobulin), which are included in transplant protocols, are used to reduce the risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) or suppress allograft rejection. Available clinical studies have been conducted in heterogenous patient populations and with different administration protocols including stem cell sources. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of ATG is variable, and the clinically effective dose of rATG-F, in particular, is not exactly known. The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who underwent hemopoietic peripheral stem cell transplantation from full-matched sibling donors and given two different doses of r-ATG-F.
Methods
This was a single-center, retrospective chart review conducted between July 2005 and July 2016. Sixty-nine consecutive AML patients who underwent transplant with fludarabine- and busulfan-based conditioning were included in the study. Patients in Group 1 received 15 mg/kg body weight rATG-F to 2013 (n = 46), and Group 2 received 30 mg/kg of rATG-F dose begining in 2013 to reduce to cGVHD (n = 23). Cyclosporine and methotrexate were used to treat acute GVHD (aGVHD) prophylaxis. Outcome parameters were compared between the groups.
Results
Although the recommended dose r-ATG-F had led to a decrease in the cumulative incidence of cGVHD (27 [58.7%] vs. 8 [34.8%]; p = .03), it also increased the infection rate at 1 year (3 [6.5%] vs. 4 [17.4%]; p = .02). The two groups were similar in terms of engraftment time, aGVHD, relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and rATG-F-related toxicity. A Cox regression model revealed that aGVHD III–IV was associated with increased nonrelapse mortality at 1 year (hazard ratio = 18.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.667–199.255; p = <.02). No patients developed rATG-F-related severe adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria grade 4 or 5).
Conclusion
Dose difference of rATG-F did not influence survival parameters; however, increasing the dose to 30 mg/kg seems to be effective for reducing cGVHD with an increase in infection rate requiring close monitoring of infections in AML patients who received myeloablative fludarabine/busulfan conditioning.

Abstract: Significant surface related degradation (SRD) is observed in samples passivated with either SiNx:H or AlOx:H/SiNx:H during treatment at 150 °C and 1 sun equivalent illumination intensity. Degradation of SiNx:H passivation is caused by a decrease of chemical passivation quality whereas degradation of AlOx:H/SiNx:H is caused by a decrease of fixed charge density. SRD is, however, strongly suppressed on highly doped silicon surfaces resulting from a diffusion step. Device simulations indicate that this cannot only be explained by reduced sensitivity to changes at the silicon surface due to the diffused region, and implications for defect formation are discussed.

Abstract: The pro-apoptotic Bax protein is the main effector of mitochondrial permeabilization during apoptosis. Bax is controlled at several levels, including post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and S-palmitoylation. However, little is known about the contribution of other protein modifications to Bax activity. Here, we used heterologous expression of human Bax in yeast to study the involvement of N-terminal acetylation by yNaa20p (yNatB) on Bax function. We found that human Bax is N-terminal (Nt-)acetylated by yNaa20p and that Nt-acetylation of Bax is essential to maintain Bax in an inactive conformation in the cytosol of yeast and Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) cells. Bax accumulates in the mitochondria of yeast naa20Δ and Naa25−/− MEF cells, but does not promote cytochrome c release, suggesting that an additional step is required for full activation of Bax. Altogether, our results show that Bax N-terminal acetylation by NatB is involved in its mitochondrial targeting.

Abstract: Semitransparent (ST) Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) solar cells based on the ultrathin absorbers with a bandgap of ~1.5eV are prepared on the tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) back electrode. In a solar cell with absorber thickness ≤300nm, incorporation of a sulfurized-AgGa (AGS) layer between the CIGSe layer and the ITO back contact was found to improve the device efficiency. This article explores the effect of the AGS layer on the CIGSe structure and CIGSe/ITO interface. Meanwhile, an ordered defect compound formation is observed in the AGS interlayered-CIGSe absorbers, the origin of which is the decrease in the (Ag+Cu)/(Ga+In) ratio arising from diffusion of In from the ITO to the absorber and the Ag/Ga ratio of 0.60 in the AGS layer. It is found that the AGS layer can significantly reduce the formation of the GaOx phase at the CIGSe/ITO interface. However, the increase in the deposition time of the CIGSe layer in the AGS interlayered-absorbers resulted in an increase in the GaOx interfacial (IF) layer thickness. The roll-over phenomenon in the illuminated J-V curves of devices based on AGS interlayered-absorbers became increasingly pronounced when the thickness of GaOx IF layer increased. The SCAPS (solar cell capacitance simulator) simulation results indicate that the reason for the roll-over effect in the illuminated J-V curves of the solar cells with AGS layers is the GaOx IF phase (n-type in nature). In light of the present results, possibilities to further enhance the conversion efficiency of ST CIGSe solar cells are also discussed.

Abstract: Obesity is a chronic inflammatory state with cytokines, adipokines, and miRNAs. The A2a-adenosine system decreases activation and cytokine release in immune cells. MiR-221 is upregulated in carcinogenesis and inflammatory processes, where its targets PTEN and ETS-1, negatively regulates the Akt pathway and induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. However, the roles of the A2a-adenosine system and miR-221 in adipose tissue are unknown. The aim of this work was to evaluate the A2a-adenosine and miRNA pathways as immune modulators in adipose tissue. We collected aspirate of adipose tissue from patients with BMI < 25 kg/m2 (BMI < 25) and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (BMI ≥ 25) who underwent liposuction; the adipose tissue was digested with collagenase, and then a Ficoll gradient was performed to obtain mononuclear cells from adipose tissue (MCAT). We evaluated the A2a levels by quantitative Retro-transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and flow cytometry and the A2a-adenosine function with a proliferation assay or cytokine levels in the presence or absence of NAD+, activators, and inhibitors of the system. We also analyzed miR-221, ETS-1 and PTEN levels by qRT-PCR. First, we detected that MCAT presented higher basal proliferation than mononuclear cells from peripheral blood; however, activation of the A2a receptor downregulated cell proliferation and cytokine release. Interestingly, while miR-221 was downregulated in MCAT from subjects with BMI ≥ 25 compared to BMI < 25, their targets ETS-1 and PTEN, were increased. In conclusion, the A2a-adenosine system is decreased in MCAT, but it maintains its function; moreover, miR-221 could participate in promoting inflammation in adipose tissue.

Abstract: Inorganic phase change materials possess superior properties such as better thermal conductivity, higher latent heat of fusion, and cheaper price to their organic counterparts. However, their extreme supercooling during freezing and phase segregation during melting have led to challenges in their applications to thermal energy storage. In this paper, a series of sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) nanocomposites filled with bio-derived chitin nanowhiskers (CNW) as the nucleating agent have been prepared and tested. Experimental results revealed that the bio-derived nanoparticles were an effective and stable nucleating agent to suppress SAT's supercooling. Furthermore, smaller SAT particle size (< 53 µm), optimal CNW content (1 wt%) as well as presence of surfactant and thickening agent were advantageous to the phase change performance of SAT-CNW nanocomposites. It must also be noted that the heating temperature during the melting cycle should be limited to 70 °C or below to retain the nanocomposite's capability to efficiently store and release thermal energy. To enhance the nanocomposite's effective thermal conductivity, different loadings of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) were added. It was found that 1 wt% of hBN was appropriate to enhance the nanocomposite's heat transfer ability by 35% without compromising its low supercooling degree. The thermal properties of the nanocomposites were also analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry. Thermal analyses indicated that although adding nucleating agent, thickening agent, surfactant, and thermally conductive filler would decrease the heat of fusion of SAT, the nanocomposite's thermal storage ability was superior to other organic phase change materials. Thermal cycling results also revealed the thermal reliability of the SAT-CNW nanocomposites. In short, this work reported an appropriate formulation of SAT nanocomposites filled with bio-derived nucleating agents that exhibited promising phase change performances.

Abstract: In this paper, novel micro- and nano-composite Al-doped ZnO (AZO) films with broadband-gap light-trapping capacity was successfully fabricated by post-chemical-etching AZO film and re-sputtering self-textured H and Al co-doped ZnO (HAZO) film. The influence of pressure and etching time on the optical and electrical properties of HAZO, AZO, and AZO/HAZO films were systematically investigated. The performance of this novel ZnO film was increased remarkably compared to that of the post-etched AZO film or native textured HAZO film for both long and short wavelengths. Microcrystalline silicon solar cells deposited on this new type of AZO/HAZO films exhibited a strong enhancement of 13.4% in the conversion efficiency, demonstrating its wide application prospect.

Abstract: Lanthionine synthetase component C-like protein 2 (LANCL2) has been identified as the mammalian receptor mediating the functional effects of the universal stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA) in mammals. ABA stimulates insulin independent glucose uptake in myocytes and adipocytes via LANCL2 binding in vitro, improves glucose tolerance in vivo and induces brown fat activity in vitro and in vivo. The emerging role of the ABA/LANCL2 system in glucose and lipid metabolism makes it an attractive target for pharmacological interventions in diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of ABA binding site(s) on LANCL2 and identify the amino acid residues involved in ABA binding. Equilibrium binding assays ([3H]-ABA saturation binding and surface plasmon resonance analysis) suggested multiple ABA-binding sites, prompting us to perform a computational study that indicated one putative high-affinity and two low-affinity binding sites. Site-directed mutagenesis (single mutant R118I, triple mutants R118I/R22I/K362I and R118I/S41A/E46I) and equilibrium binding experiments on the mutated LANCL2 proteins identified a high-affinity ABA-binding site involving R118, with a KD of 2.6 nM ± 1.2 nM, as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Scatchard plot analysis of binding curves from both types of equilibrium binding assays revealed a Hill coefficient >1, suggesting cooperativity of ABA binding to LANCL2. Identification of the high-affinity ABA-binding site is expected to allow the design of ABA agonists/antagonists, which will help to understand the role of the ABA/LANCL2 system in human physiology and disease.

Abstract: Docking, priming, and membrane fusion of secretory vesicles (i.e. regulated exocytosis) requires lipids and proteins. Sphingolipids, in particular, sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate, have been implicated in the modulation of exocytosis. However, the specific exocytotic steps that sphingolipids modulate and the enzymes that regulate sphingolipid concentrations on native secretory vesicle membranes remain unknown. Here we use tightly coupled functional and molecular analyses of fusion-ready cell surface complexes and cortical vesicles isolated from oocytes to assess the role of sphingolipids in the late, Ca2+-triggered steps of exocytosis. The molecular changes resulting from treatments with sphingolipid modifying compounds coupled with immunoblotting analysis revealed the presence of sphingosine kinase on native vesicles; the presence of a sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase is also indicated. Changes in sphingolipid concentrations on vesicles altered their docking/priming, Ca2+-sensitivity, and ability to fuse, indicating that sphingolipid concentrations are tightly regulated and maintained at optimal levels and ratios to ensure efficient exocytosis.

Abstract: Background
Hydroxyurea reduces complications and improves health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, however adherence remains suboptimal. Understanding patients’ views of hydroxyurea is critical to optimize adherence, particularly in adolescents and young adults (AYA). Study objectives were to assess beliefs about hydroxyurea using the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), and to examine the relationship of patients’ beliefs to their hydroxyurea adherence and HRQOL.
Methods
Thirty-four AYA with SCD participated in a cross-sectional study January–December 2015. Study assessments included BMQ to examine beliefs about hydroxyurea; Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to assess hydroxyurea adherence; and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) to evaluate HRQOL.
Results
Participants (41% female, 91% Black) had median age of 13.5 (IQR 12–18) years. Participants’ concerns about overuse of medications correlated with concerns about hydroxyurea (rs = 0.36, p = 0.04) and overall harm of medications (rs = 0.5, p = 0.003). Participants’ age positively correlated with the necessity of hydroxyurea (rs = 0.45, p = 0.007). Participants’ concerns about hydroxyurea and overuse of medications positively correlated with anxiety (rs = 0.41, p = 0.02; rs = 0.44, p = 0.01) and depression (rs = 0.37, p = 0.04; rs = 0.54, p = 0.001), but inversely correlated with peer relationships (rs = −0.45, p = 0.03; rs = −0.44, p = 0.03), respectively, suggesting better HRQOL with concerns. Fifty percent of participants reported low hydroxyurea adherence (VAS < 80%), which was more seen in patients with higher concerns about hydroxyurea (p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Beliefs about hydroxyurea correlated with HRQOL scores and adherence levels. Addressing patients’ concern about hydroxyurea and medications overall as well as routine assessment of adherence and beliefs could help to overcome adherence barriers.

Abstract: Circulating miRNAs have recently emerged as attractive candidates for biomarker discovery. However, they have a variant distribution in circulation, and the diagnostic significance of their compartmentalization is yet to be elucidated. This study explored the time-course expression profile and the diagnostic potential of miRNAs-122a-5p, 192-5p, 193a-3p and 194-5p in exosomal and total serum compartments in two rat models of acute liver injury (ALI)11ALI: acute liver injury; miRNA: micro RNA; DILI: drug induced liver injury; ACAP: acetaminophen; TAA: thioacetamide; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; ROC: Receiver operator characteristic analysis; AUROC: Area under ROC.. Exosomes were isolated and characterized in terms of morphology, size and CD-63 surface marker expression. Exosomal, serum and hepatic miRNAs were quantified using q-RT-PCR. An inverse expression pattern of hepatic and total serum miRNAs was observed following acetaminophen or thioacetamide-induced liver injury. Conversely, exosomal miRNAs expression pattern varied according to the type of injury. Overall, ROC analysis revealed superior discriminatory ability of exosomal miRNA-122a-5p following either acetaminophen or thioacetamide injury with earlier diagnostic potential and a wider diagnostic window compared to the corresponding total serum counterpart. Moreover, exosomal miRNAs showed higher correlation with ALT activity in both models. In conclusion, exosomal miRNA-122a-5p shows higher diagnostic performance with a broader diagnostic time window and an earlier diagnostic potential than its serum counterpart in ALI. Furthermore, exosomal miRNAs-122a-5p, 192-5p and 193a-3p exhibit an injury-specific signature in ALI and can be used not only as diagnostic tools in liver injury but also to differentiate between different etiologies of injury.

Abstract: Recent studies have reported that chemically synthesized double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), also known as small activating RNA (saRNAs), can specifically induce gene expression by targeting promoter sequences by a mechanism termed RNA activation (RNAa). In the present study, we designed 4 candidate saRNAs targeting the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene promoter. Among these saRNAs, dsVHL-821 significantly inhibited cell growth by up-regulating VHL at both the mRNA and protein levels in renal cell carcinoma 769-P cells. Functional analysis showed that dsVHL-821 induced apoptosis by increasing p53, decreasing Bcl-xL, activating caspase 3/7 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that dsVHL-821 increased the enrichment of Ago2 and RNA polymerase II at the dsVHL-821 target site. In addition, Ago2 depletion significantly suppressed dsVHL-821-induced up-regulation of VHL gene expression and related effects. Single transfection of dsVHL-821 caused long-lasting (14 days) VHL up-regulation. Furthermore, the activation of VHL by dsVHL-821 was accompanied by an increase in dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2) and acetylation of histone 4 (H4ac) and a decrease in dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) and lysine 27 (H3K27me2) in the dsVHL-821 target region. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dsVHL-821, a novel saRNA for VHL, induces the expression of the VHL gene by epigenetic changes, leading to inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis, and suggest that targeted activation of VHL by dsVHL-821 may be explored as a novel treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

Abstract: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a critical risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI). Recent studies provided evidence that tubular epithelial cells (TEC)-associated inflammation aggravates kidney injury and impairs tissue repair after I/R injury. Here we demonstrated that the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is activated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) during I/R injury via direct interactions between the inflammasome and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP). Firstly, we found that NLRP3 inflammasome activation was induced by I/R injury, peaking at day 3 after reperfusion. Consistent with this observation, NLRP3 deletion significantly attenuated I/R-induced kidney damage and markers of inflammasome activation. Then, we observed mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by ultrastructural changes and cytochrome C (Cyt c) redistribution. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO prevented mROS overproduction and the decline in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in vitro. MitoTEMPO treatment also inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and co-localization of NLRP3 and TXNIP after simulated ischemia/reperfusion (SI/R) injury. Finally, we transfected HK-2 cells with TXNIP siRNA to explore the role of TXNIP in mROS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We found that TXNIP siRNA significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome is activated through the mROS-TXNIP-NLRP3 pathway and provide a potential therapeutic target in ischemic AKI.

Abstract: In order to evaluate the effect of nanoparticles on the specific heat capacity of a low-melting-point eutectic quaternary nitrate salt, 1.0 wt% SiO2 nanoparticles with an average size of 20 nm was doped into the mixed salt Ca(NO3)2·4H2O-KNO3-NaNO3-LiNO3. A mechanical dispersion mixer was developed to prepare molten salt nanofluids. The effects of the mixing time (15, 45, 90, 120, and 150 min) and stirring rate (600, 750, and 1000 rpm) on the specific heat capacity of the nanofluids were analyzed using a differential scanning calorimeter. The results showed that the specific heat capacity of the nanofluids varied with the mixing time and stirring rate. It increased by ~ 17.0% at a mixing time of 15 min and stirring rate of 750 rpm. Microstructural characterization of the molten salt nanocomposites was performed using scanning electron microscopy, which showed that special nanostructures, which resemble chain-like nanostructures, were formed on the surface of the solid nanofluids. The special nanostructures with a large specific surface area and high surface energy could increase the specific heat capacity of the molten salt nanofluids.

Abstract: p-type ZnSe nanoribbon and n-type Si nanowire are used to prepare crossed p-n nano-heterojuncion through a two step of contact sliding transfer method. Obvious diode characteristics with a large rectification ratio of ~ 20 and a small ideality factor of ~ 2.1 are presented due to the nano-heterojunction's half-surrounded structure and the appropriate energy band alignment between the two materials. Kelvin probe force microscopy measurement and temperature-dependent electrical characterization are devoted to demonstrate the energy barrier and investigate the transport mechanism of the nano-heterojunction. Moreover, under AM 1.5G light illumination, the crossed nano-heterojunction exhibits evident photovoltaic behavior, yielding a power conversion efficiency of ~3%. Our results demonstrate the great potential of the prepared crossed nano-heterojunction in high-performance nano-device applications.

Abstract: Within this work, we present a method for fast characterization and statistical analysis of structural and electrical crystal properties. By this, we investigate the impact of grain size and grain shape distribution in the lower part of the brick on the defect development in the upper part of the brick. Our method is based on fast measurements on as-cut wafers, namely photoluminescence imaging and reflection or infrared transmission images. We combine the extracted information and isolate dislocation structures from recombination active grain boundaries via image-processing. Two large data sets (more than 40 bricks) of different materials allow us to quantify the assumed correlation between grain structure and dislocation development. The results confirm that the relative length of dark lines as a part of dislocation clusters in the upper brick part shows a locally linear correlation with the square root of a meaningful grain area measure in the lower brick part (Pearson coefficient R between 0.80 and 0.88). It also correlates with the inhomogeneity measures for grain area and shape (Pearson coefficient R about 0.88). As a result, changes in the crystallization process may be targeted according to the grain structure in the lower part of the brick. In the future, this method may serve to improve the prediction of solar cell results based on wafer-data.

Abstract: A physical stimuli, it has been reported that cyclic tensile strain can promote bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, but the underlying mechanisms have been poorly elucidated so far. Here, we used a mimicking loading strain, cyclic biaxial tensile strain (CBTS), and found it can promote BMSCs to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. When the CBTS were loaded, the cells expressed cardiac-specific markers GATA4, TNNT2, MEF-2c, and Cx43, meanwhile we found miR-27a decreased and stem cell factor (SCF) increased. When we overexpressed miR-27a, the cardiac-specific markers were down-regulated; we got the same results when SCF was knocked down by siRNA. Interestingly, we found SCF is a potential target of miR-27a by a bioinformatic analysis. So, we overexpressed miR-27a, and found SCF decreased both in mRNA and protein level. And, When miR-27a was co-transfected with SCF-3′UTR, it significantly reduced the luciferase activity, but not when co-transfected with SCF-3′UTR mutation plasmid. Furthermore, after transfected both miR-27a and SCF siRNA, and the protein expression of the markers were more down-regulated than that of single of them. Taken together, we found CBTS can promote BMSCs to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, and miR-27a functions as a mechano-sensitive miRNA in this process by targeting SCF.

Abstract: The light emitting diodes (LEDs) irradiation has been demonstrated to be potential therapeutic strategies for several diseases. However, the blue LED effects remain largely unknown in colorectal cancer (CRC), which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. In this study, we determined the effects of blue LED irradiation, the maximal light emission at 470 nm in wavelength, in human CRC cell lines SW620 and HT29. The cells were irradiated with blue LED light for 0 J/cm2, 72 J/cm2, 144 J/cm2, 216 J/cm2 and 288 J/cm2 respectively. We found that irradiation with blue LED light induced a marked decrease of live cells and an increase of dead cells. Additionally, lower cell proliferation and a remarkably increase of cell apoptosis were observed in blue LED-irradiated cells as compared with non-irradiated control group. The cell migration was significantly inhibited by blue LED irradiation 24, 48 and 72 h later compared with non-treated group. Blue LED-treated CRC cells further displayed a remarkably inhibition of EMT process in CRC cells. Finally, we found the accumulation of ROS production and DNA damage were induced by blue LED irradiation. These results indicated that blue LED irradiation inhibits CRC cell proliferation, migration and EMT process as well as induces cell apoptosis, which may result from increased ROS accumulation and induction of DNA damage.

Abstract: The eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl salt was investigated as a novel high temperature phase change material for solar thermal energy storage due to its low cost and melting point (626.0°C) interested. The measured melting point and heat of fusion of the eutectic salt are 625.3°C and 263.3J/g, which are in agreement with their theoretical values. The eutectic salt shows good thermal stability after 100 melting-freezing thermal cycles in the range of 550–680°C in air. Three types of the eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl-ceramic composites have been designed and evaluated to address the salt’ corrosion issues with containment materials. Results show that eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl/both α-alumina and mullite composites with a mass ratio of salt to ceramics of 1:1 (wt%) have good thermal stability without cracking as well as with weight losses of 0.50% and 0.74% and the decrease of latent heat by 1% and 2% respectively after 20 thermal cycles, where no phase separation and chemical reaction occur. Their measured melting temperature and latent heat are consistent with their theoretical values. Addition of α-alumina and mullite to the eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl salt can reduce the eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl salt’ supercooling. In contrast, the sample of the Na2SO4-NaCl/diatomite composite cracked after the cycles.

Abstract: Surveillance scans after autologous stem cell transplant (auto-HCT) for patients with relapsed/refractory (RR) diffuse large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have no proven survival benefit. We studied survival differences among patients with RR DLBCL post auto-HCT whose recurrences were detected clinically versus with routine surveillance imaging. Among the 139 patients with RR DLBCL that underwent auto-HCT from 2000 to 2014 at our institution, 37 relapsed: 21 clinical and 16 radiological. The median time to progression was 167 days for the clinical cohort and 565 days for the radiological cohort (p = 0.03), and median overall survival (OS) was 587 days and not reached, respectively (p = 0.006). Most patients with relapsed DLBCL after auto-HCT were diagnosed clinically and were likely to be detected earlier and have a shorter OS. Relapse in patients with aggressive disease will likely be detected when clinically apparent, and the outcome of these patients is independent of the way the relapse is diagnosed. Thus, universal scanning after auto-HCT appears to have little benefit.

Abstract: While there is continuous progress in development of new photocatalytic thin films and coatings, the lack of a reliable and standard procedure for measuring the photocatalytic performance of such active surfaces makes it difficult to compare results between research groups and different measurement setups. Here, a comparative study was carried out to demonstrate the high photocatalytic activity of sputter-deposited TiO2 film with self-organized nanocrack networks by using two different analytical approaches: (i) bleaching of a thin Methylene Blue (MB) solid layer on photocatalytic TiO2 thin film (in-air) and (ii) the decolorization of a MB aqueous solution in the presence of TiO2 thin film (in-solution). While the decolorization of aqueous MB solution provides an indirect observation of the photocatalytic effect imposed by the TiO2 film, the use of a solid MB layer as an indicator allows monitoring of photocatalytic reactions at the solid-air interface directly. We showed the applicability of this approach as a complementary and a fast analysis method to reveal the photocatalytic efficiency of thin films by comparing it with the state of the art inks (based on MB and other similar organic dyes) used as photocatalysis indicator.

Abstract: High aerobic glycolysis not only provides energy to breast cancer cells, but also supports their anabolic growth. The redox sensitive transcription factor NRF2 is over-expressed in multiple cancers, including breast cancer. It is unclear whether NRF2 could promote breast cancer cell growth through enhancing glycolysis. In this study, we found that NRF2 and HIF1α mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as compared to MCF-10A benign breast epithelial cells. Down-regulation of NRF2 decreased MCF7 and MBA-DA-231 breast cell proliferation, while it reversed by hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). Knockdown of NRF2 inhibited glycolysis by decreasing the expression of genes participated in glucose metabolism, including HK2, PFKFB3, PKM2 and LDHA. Our results further indicated that the AKT activation and AMPK inhibition were required for NRF2-mediated up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes. Consistent with these results, a positive correlation existed between NRF2 or HIF1α and several key glycolytic genes in human breast cancer cell samples and breast cancer patients with high NRF2 or HIF1α expression had poorer overall survival. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that NRF2 promotes breast cancer progression by enhancing glycolysis through coactivation of HIF1α, implicating that NRF2 is a potential molecular target for breast cancer treatment.

Abstract: An ultrathin layer of SiOx formed on the surface of a silicon solar cell can significantly reduce the potential induced degradation effect in solar cell modules. In this work, a liquid oxidation (LO) technique was developed to oxidize silicon surfaces by using a Ti/IrO2–CoO2 anode that can produce a large amount of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and other species. Our results indicate that the LO SiOx (2.5 nm) layer is very dense, thus the modules made from LO treated cells are better able to mitigate potential induced degradation than modules made from ozone oxidized cells.

Abstract: Plant defensins, a group of antimicrobial peptides, show selective cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. However, their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of PaDef defensin from avocado (Persea americana var. drymifolia) on K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells and analyzed the pathway involved in the induction of cell death. The defensin PaDef was not cytotoxic against human PBMCs; however, it was cytotoxic for K562 cell line (IC50 = 97.3 μg/ml) activating apoptosis at 12 h. PaDef did not affect the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), neither the transmembranal potential or the release of intracellular calcium. Also, PaDef induced gene expression of caspase 8 (∼2 fold), TNF-α (∼4 fold) and TNFR1 (∼10 fold). In addition, the activation of caspase 8 was detected at 24 h, whereas caspase 9 activity was not modified, suggesting that the extrinsic apoptosis pathway could be activated. In conclusion, PaDef induces apoptosis on K562 cells, which is related to the activation of caspase 8 and involves the participation of TNF-α, which is a novel property for a plant defensin.

Abstract: Sb2Se3 thin films prepared by vapor transport deposition (VTD) method have been treated by post annealing process at 200 °C in vacuum condition for 1 h, and the comparative studies between the post annealing treatment (PAT) and without the treatment were carried out. The device efficiency was improved from 4.89% to 5.72% by PAT via the augment of open-circuit voltage and fill factor. Electrical properties from dark J-V and C-V measurements, structural properties from X-ray diffraction, Raman and scanning electron microscope measurements, defect properties from admittance measurements have been compared for the two cell samples. The Sb2Se3 cell sample with PAT was found to own less parallel current pathways, larger built-in voltage, better crystalline and lower defects densities, which may account for the efficiency enhancement.

The first 1D model describes the technology and outputs device current density in dependence of voltage, temperature, illumination, etc. The second 3D model uses this data as one of its inputs, and describes size, shape and interconnection of the individual cells within the curved flexible module. In this way power production of such photovoltaic system can be assessed in reasonable time and computing resources. Two study cases are presented: a dome shaped solar street lamp and a conic shaped active rooftop shading for a skylight.

Abstract: The morphologies of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films of blended semiconductor of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and 1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)-propyl-1-phenyl-(6,6)C61 (PCBM) deposited by doctor blading and spin coating were investigated. Controlled phase separation in BHJ organic/polymer solar cells (OSCs) were achieved using doctor blading. The results revealed that the coating method induced a significant difference in the film morphology. The vertical phase distribution of the BHJ layer fabricated by doctor blading was uniform, while uneven phase distribution was observed in spin coated BHJ layer. The uniform phase distribution in the doctor blading coated film resulted in higher charge carrier mobility and power conversion efficiency in solar cell than those in films fabricated from spin coating. The results demonstrated that doctor blading has advantages not only in large area high throughput and roll-to-roll compatibility, but also in better control of film morphology to achieve high efficiency consistently in OSC devices.

Abstract: This paper presents direct experimental evidence for the strong impurity gettering effects associated with the formation of both phosphorus and boron doped polysilicon/oxide passivating contacts for silicon solar cells, doped via thermal diffusion from POCl3 or BBr3 sources. Ion-implanted iron is used as a marker to quantify the gettering effectiveness via carrier lifetime measurements. The process conditions for fabricating optimum polysilicon passivating contacts are found to remove more than 99.9% of the iron from the silicon wafer bulk. The gettering effects of POCl3 and BBr3 diffused polysilicon/oxide contacts mainly arise from the dopant diffusions, as opposed to gettering by structural defects in the polysilicon films. The thin oxide interlayer hinders the gettering effectiveness at low diffusion temperatures, although its blocking effect becomes small at the moderate temperatures used to fabricate optimum polysilicon contacts. The gettering effectiveness increases with increasing diffusion temperature. The gettering of iron from the silicon wafer bulk to the surface layers is found to have a negligible impact on their ability to suppress recombination at the interface with the silicon wafer. Therefore, the formation of polysilicon/oxide passivating contacts, via thermal diffusion from POCl3 and BBr3 sources, not only achieves high quality surface and contact passivation but also has the net additional benefit of achieving very effective gettering of unwanted impurities in the silicon wafer bulk.

Abstract: In this work, rear-contact passivated Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells were fabricated without any intentional contact openings between the CIGS and Mo layers. The investigated samples were either Na free or one of two Na supply methods was used, i) a NaF precursor on top of the Al2O3 rear passivation layer or ii) an in situ post-deposition treatment with NaF after co-evaporation of the CIGS layer. The thickness of the ALD-Al2O3 passivation layer was also varied in order to find an optimal combination of Na supply and passivation layer thickness. Our results from electrical characterization show remarkably different solar cell behavior for different Na supplies. For up to 1 nm thick Al2O3 layers an electronically good contact could be confirmed independently of Na deposition method and content. When the Al2O3 thickness exceeded 1 nm, the current was blocked on all samples except on the samples with the NaF precursor. On these samples the current was not blocked up to an Al2O3 layer thickness of about 6 nm, the maximum thickness we could achieve without the CIGS peeling off the Al2O3 layer. Transmission electron microscopy reveals a porous passivation layer for the samples with a NaF precursor. An analysis of the dependence of the open circuit voltage on temperature (JVT) indicates that a thicker NaF precursor layer lowers the height of the hole barrier at the rear contact for the passivated cells. This energy barrier is also lower for the passivated sample, compared to an unpassivated sample, when both samples have been post-deposition treated.

Abstract: In this work, we report systematic studies on improving the optical and electrical properties of four-terminal perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cells. Light harvesting power of the device is significantly enhanced due to the complementary absorption spectra of the perovskite and c-Si absorber materials. To obtain high power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the device, careful engineering of optoelectronic properties of the devices are accomplished through: 1. Oxygen annealing treatment for reducing defect density of perovskite materials; 2. Optical engineering of the transparent electrode (MoO3/Au/MoO3) to obtain high transmission at long wavelengths for the tandem solar cell applications; and 3. Enhancement of light harvesting power achieved by using the novel biomimicking elastomeric petals as the light trapping layer. The individual perovskite solar cell (PSC) with MoO3/Au/MoO3 electrode with or without light trapping layer yields an average PCE of 16.6% and 16.0% respectively. By combining c-Si bottom cell with perovskite top cell mechanically, an overall PCE of 22.4% is achieved for the averaged value, which is a promising result for future development of perovskite based tandem solar cells.

Abstract: The co-existing secondary phases, in off-stoichiometric Cu-Zn-Sn-S (CZTS) solar cells, are one of the main causes of performance gap between earth abundant CZTS and matured Cu-In-Ga-Se (CIGS) solar cells technology. Highly metallic Cu-S based secondary phases provide shunting paths to the current flow and critically affect the device performance. Several chemical etchants have been developed and used to remove conductive Cu2-xS phase from CZTS absorber surface before device fabrication. Present work is mainly focused to tune the Zn/Sn composition ratio in co-sputtered CZTS active layer to suppress the formation of Cu2-xS phase during the growth itself to eliminate the additional step of etching in device fabrication. Significant reduction of Cu2-xS secondary phase was observed with decreased Zn/Sn ratio, which resulted in more than 3 times efficiency enhancement for the final composition. The fabricated solar cell in the stacking order of Ag/ITO/i-ZnO/CdS/CZTS/Mo/SLG with optimum composition showed an efficiency of 6.11% without any antireflection coating. Controlling the Zn/Sn ratio resulted in an effective and virtuous solution to avoid the detrimental secondary phases like Cu2-xS, which conventionally required a chemical etching treatment.

Abstract: The light management strategy was applied in III-V solar cells for the maximum utilization of incident photon, namely the selective rear contact was adopted in Ga0.5In0.5P- and GaAs- based solar cells. By etching the rear contact layer (p-GaAs) with photolithography, the distinctive morphological structures consisting of polka-dot patterns were formed, which led to increased reflection and thereby the device performance. Furthermore, the photolithography was controlled to find the optimum contact ratio between the back-surface field and the rear contact. Consequently, the conversion efficiency was increased from η = 15.5% to 16.3% for the Ga0.5In0.5P-based single-junction solar cell, and from η = 21.1% to 21.9% for the GaAs-based one, both at the contact ratio of 10%, compared to the cells with full (100%) rear contact ratio. Finally, the selective rear contact was applied to double-junction solar cells (Ga0.5In0.5P- and GaAs- based), exhibiting that this straightforward rear-contact strategy has enabled reaching the efficiency of η = 30.6% with an anti-reflective coating.

Abstract: Monochromatic conversion efficiencies in excess of 60% have been achieved with Vertical Epitaxial HeteroStructure Architechture laser power converters (with anywhere from 5 to 20+ n/p junctions stacked vertically). We are presently investigating the applicability of this design to solar cells, whereby the individual junctions of a multi-junction cell are replaced with a current matched stack of subcells. If viable, such a design offers the potential for efficiency gains via reduced I2R losses and elevated Voc. Moreover, splitting the short-circuit current over additional junctions opens up the possibility of operation under concentration ratios otherwise considered impractical for conventional cells.

The breast cancer antigen 5T4 interacts with Rab11, and is a target and regulator of Rab11 mediated trafficking,

Abstract: Background and aims
5T4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with limited expression in normal adult tissues and expression in some solid tumours. It is unclear whether 5T4 is preferentially expressed by stem or differentiated cell types. Modes of 5T4 regulation are unknown despite its ongoing development as a cancer immunotherapy target. Our aims were to clarify the differentiation status of 5T4 expressing cells in breast cancer and to understand the mechanism underlying 5T4 membrane presentation.
Methods and results
We analysed 5T4 expression in breast cancer cell populations by flow cytometery and found that 5T4 is highly expressed on differentiated cells, where it localizes to focal adhesions. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified interactions between 5T4 and the membrane trafficking proteins Rab11, Rab18 and ARF6. Mechanistically we found that Rab11 and Rab18 have oppositional roles in controlling expression and surface presentation of 5T4. 5T4 depletion stabilizes Rab11 protein expression with a consequent stimulation transferrin surface labelling, indicating that 5T4 represses endocytic activity.
Implications
Successful immunotherapeutic targeting of 5T4 requires surface presentation and different immunotherapy strategies require surface presentation versus endocytosis. While breast cancer cells with high 5T4 surface expression and rapid cell surface turnover would be susceptible to antibody-drug conjugates that rely on intracellular release, 5T4 positive cells with lower expression or lower turnover may still be responsive to T-cell mediated approaches. We find that endocytosis of 5T4 is strongly Rab11 dependent and as such Rab11 activity could affect the success or failure of 5T4-targetted immunotherapy, particularly for antibody-drug conjugate approaches. In fact, 5T4 itself represses Rab11 expression. This newly uncovered relationship between Rab11 and 5T4 suggests that breast tumours with high 5T4 expression may not have efficient endocytic uptake of 5T4-targetted immunotherapeutics. This should be considered when selecting amongst the different types of immunotherapies.

Abstract: Mitochondrial nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) regulate the early stage of mitochondria-driven apoptosis, including cytochrome c release. Mitochondrial nAChR signaling is mainly mediated by intra-mitochondrial kinases, in an ion-independent manner. To determine the relationship between specific nAChR subtypes and mitochondrial kinases, the effects of a set of nAChR subtype-selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) on cytochrome c release from mouse liver mitochondria stimulated by 0.9 μM Ca2+, 0.5 mM H2O2 or 1.0 μM wortmanin is studied. The results indicate that Ca2+-stimulated cytochrome c release from wild-type, but not α7-/-, mice mitochondria is attenuated by the potent agonist PNU-282987 or type II PAMs (PNU-120596, 4BP-TQS, and PAM-2-4), but not by NS-1738, a type I PAM. In contrast, wortmannin-stimulated cytochrome c release from wild-type and, to a lesser extent, α7-/- mice mitochondria is efficiently attenuated by the β2-selective PAM desformylfrustrabromine. In conclusion, the ligand-evoked α7* nAChR conformational changes required to induce intra-mitochondrial signaling can be triggered through orthosteric (agonists) and transmembrane (type II PAMs) sites, but not by the interaction with type I PAMs. The α7 and β2 nAChR subunits are responsible for the engagement of distinct kinase pathways, supporting the concept that multiple heteromeric nAChR subtypes ensure mitochondria resistance to various exogenous and endogenous apoptogenic agents.

Abstract: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) based solution has been proven promising in preparing high-quality Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorbers. In the present work, H2O is used as a simple and effective additive to optimize the film formation of DMSO based CZTS precursor. It is demonstrated that a small amount of H2O introduction into the DMSO solution reduced the oxygen content in the CZTS precursor film, and thus limited the formation of SeO2/Sn(O,Se)x secondary phase in the final CZTSSe layer. As a result of improved morphology and carrier collection ability of absorber layer, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is enhanced significantly from 7.45% for CZTSSe solar cell device prepared with pure DMSO precursor solution to 9.30% for that with an optimized DMSO/H2O ratio. Applying the same preparing strategy to the Ag containing CZTSSe device, we finally achieved a PCE of 10.3% under 1-sun illumination.

Abstract: We review the recent progress of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. Recently, a new efficiency world record for silicon solar cells of 26.7% has been set by Kaneka Corp. using this technology. This was mainly achieved by remarkably increasing the fill-factor (FF) to 84.9% - the highest FF published for a silicon solar cell to date. High FF have for long been a challenge for SHJ technology. We emphasize with the help of simulations the importance of minimised recombination, not only to reach high open-circuit voltages, but also high FF, and discuss the most important loss mechanisms. We review the different cell-to-module loss and gain mechanisms putting focus on those that impact FF. With respect to industrialization of SHJ technology, we discuss the current hindrances and possible solutions, of which many are already present in industry. With the intrinsic bifacial nature of SHJ technology as well as its low temperature coefficient record high energy production per rated power is achievable in many climate regions.

Abstract: Superb solar-to-electricity conversion property of organic-inorganic halide perovskite has recently received considerable attention. Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaches over 22%, severe current-voltage hysteresis in perovskite solar cells has been issues. To solve the hysteresis, we report here on interfacial engineering via post-treatment of perovskite films with phenylalkylammonium iodide. The 145 °C-annealed FA.9Cs.1PbI2.9Br.1 perovskite films are post-treated with series of phenylalkylammonium iodides with chemical formula of (C6H5)CnH2n(NH3I), where effects of concentration and solvent on photovoltaic performance and hysteresis are systematically investigated. For n = 2 phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI), hysteresis is reduced by PEAI treatment but there is optimal concentration to minimize the hysteresis. Average PCE, estimated from reverse and forward scanned data, of 15.94% before PEAI treatment is improved to 17.62% after 4 mM PEAI treatment mainly due to increase in average FF from 0.696 to 0.751. At higher concentration of 10 mM, average PCE is declined again to 15.60% due to the large difference in FF between reverse and forward scan. Post-treatment with PEAI increases carrier life time from 500 ns (pristine) to 795 ns, which is responsible for the reduced hysteresis. Longer alkyl chain such as PEAI (n = 2) is found to be better to reduce the hysteresis than shorter one like PAI (n = 0) because of longer carrier life time, which indicates that dipole moment of phenylalkylammonium iodide is involved in time-dependent charge extraction.

Abstract: Objective/background
Posttranslational modification of proteins, including glycosylation, is known to differ between normal and tumor cells. Altered glycosyltransferase levels have been observed in tumor tissues and their role in tumor metastasis and invasion has been implicated. In this study the role of altered glycosyltransferase messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in serum of gastric cancer patients as early markers of gastric cancer was evaluated.
Methods
In this case control study the expression profile of ppGalNAc-T6, GlcNAcT-V, ST3Gal I, ST3 Gal IV, and ST6GalNAc-I in normal healthy control and gastric cancer patients was compared. Serum was isolated from blood samples of gastric cancer patients (n = 200) and controls (n = 200). Following RNA extraction, reverse transcription was carried out and transcript levels of glycosyltransferases were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression. The amount of target gene, normalized to an endogenous reference gene relative to calibrator was calculated by using ΔΔCT method. Transcript levels in the serum samples of gastric cancer patients were compared with those of controls; also the same was correlated within sex and different stages of disease.
Results
The mRNA expression of ppGalNAc-T6 and ST6GalNAc-I was significantly higher in serum samples of gastric cancer patients on comparison with controls (p = .008), however, there was no significant difference in mRNA expression of GlcNAcT-V, ST3Gal I, and ST3 Gal IV in serum samples of gastric cancer patients and controls (p = .097). In addition, no significant association of mRNA expression of these glycosyltransferases was found within sex and stages in this study.
Conclusion
This study revealed the potential of ppGalNAc-T6 and ST6GalNAc-I mRNA transcript levels in serum as markers of gastric cancer. Further studies on the wider range of glycosyltransferases in various cancers are needed to establish signature mRNA batteries as minimally invasive markers of gastric cancer.

Abstract: Fast heat transfer is very important for practical application of phase change materials. Herein, a novel kind of silver coated nanoencapsulated phase change materials (NanoPCMs) with high thermal conductivity were prepared, and their properties were examined. Dopamine surface activation was carried out on silica nanocapsules containing n-octadecane, followed by electroless plating in Tollen's reagent. Chemical composition and crystallinity of the original silica nanocapsules, polydopamine modified NanoPCMs, and silver coated NanoPCMs were characterized by FT-IR, XPS, and XRD methods. Microstructure and morphology of these NanoPCMs were observed by SEM and TEM. Phase change property, thermal stability, thermal reliability, and thermal conductivity of these NanoPCMs were measured by DSC, TG, thermal cycling test, and laser flash methods, respectively. Although the mass-based latent heats decline obviously after silver plating due to high density of metallic Ag, the volume-based latent heats only exhibit minor decrease. These NanoPCMs crystallize mainly based on heterogeneous nucleation and show low supercooling, by introducing n-octacosane as nucleating agent. Moreover, they can keep constant phase change properties during multiple melting/solidifying thermal cycles. Most importantly, the apparent thermal conductivity of the silver coated NanoPCMs increases significantly from 0.246 to 1.346W/mK. Owing to these excellent properties, the silver coated NanoPCMs are promising for thermal energy storage and thermo-regulation applications.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) system is greatly used in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants to collect energy for later need. It is proposed that slag is suitable for energy storage in CSP plants, however, little has been studied in this field. In this paper, the thermal stability, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and microstructures of two electric arc furnace (EAF) slag samples were studied. In TES system, as heat storage material, slag will meet with high temperature and low temperature environment. The wear resulted from heat expansion and cold contraction of slag with storaging and releasing energy process was addressed. The results revealed that slag is a good candidate to be used as heat storage material for TES system. Revalorization of slag into TES material is a cost-effective solution to the CSP plants and the industry waste recovery.

Abstract: In this work we study the degradation of roll-coated flexible inverted organic solar cells in different atmospheres. We demonstrate that impedance spectroscopy is a powerful tool for elucidating degradation mechanisms; it is used here to distinguish the different degradation mechanisms due to water and oxygen. Identical cells were exposed to different accelerated degradation environments using water only, oxygen only, and both water and oxygen simultaneously, all of them enhanced with UV light. The photocurrent is dramatically reduced in the oxygen-degraded samples. Impedance measurements indicate that this phenomenon is attributed to defects introduced by absorption of oxygen, which results in an increase of the acceptor impurity (NA) at the cathode interface obtained from a Mott-Schottky analysis. Simultaneously, at the anode interface where PEDOT:PSS is not shielded by the substrate, the nature of degradation differs for the water and oxygen degraded samples. While oxygen + UV light decreases the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layer, water + UV light changes the PEDOT:PSS work function inducing a depletion region at the anode.

Abstract: RNA binding proteins serve as critical molecular switches in a multitude of post-transcriptional regulatory processes. In the heart and muscles, the tissue specific RNA binding protein, Rbm24, is known to play important developmental roles via driving different post-transcriptional processes. Nonetheless, the currently identified molecular targets and regulatory pathways seem inadequate to completely explain the observed developmental effects upon Rbm24 knockdown/knockout. Here, by performing RNA Immunoprecipitation and coupling it to microarrays (RIP-Chip), we have generated an atlas of the mRNA binding repertoire of Rbm24. Further functional evaluation of its targets led to the elucidation of novel roles for Rbm24 in post-transcriptional processing, besides its already known roles in regulation of mRNA stability and alternative splicing. Interestingly, Rbm24 is found to cause the destabilization of Chrm2 via binding to an element in the coding region. In addition, Rbm24 is also found to have an uncharacterized role in driving the generation of isoforms with alternative transcriptional start sites. We have, for the first time, demonstrated that Rbm24 is a multi-tasking RNA binding protein capable of regulating its bound targets via a range of mechanisms.

Abstract: Reaction pathways during formation of Ag(In0.75Ga0.25)Se2 films were investigated by ex-situ characterization of time-progressive reactions using rapid thermal processing at 450 °C under 5% Ar/H2Se atmosphere. Composition measurements using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) show that with Ag/(Ag+Cu) = 1.0, Ga grading and Se uptake occur gradually up to 20 min. With 7 min reaction, there was no sign of a AgInSe2 phase and only a Ag(In,Ga)5Se8 chalcogenide phase formed. The reaction was completed with formation of Ag(In,Ga)Se2 and Ag(In,Ga)5Se8 within 20 min. The addition of Cu to the precursor so that Ag/(Ag+Cu) = 0.75 speeds up the reaction and reduces the formation of the Ag(In,Ga)5Se8 phase. EDS and XRF analyses indicated that Ga grading and Se uptake were completed after 10 min. XRD analysis also shows formation of CuInSe2 on the surface of the sample with Cu after 3.5 min reaction prior to other chalcogenide formation. On the other hand, a strong Ag(In,Ga)Se2 (112) XRD peak appeared after 5 min reaction compared to 10 min reaction for 100% Ag films. EDS and Raman scattering measurements on the back-side of the films after delamination from the substrate indicated that Ga accumulated in AgGaSe2 and Ga-Se phases at the back-side of films after 45 min reaction. XRD analysis showed that Ag tends to stay in the stable ζ-Ag3(In,Ga) phase during the reaction with Ag/(Ag+Cu) = 1.0, but not with 0.75, and this causes the longer reaction time and the non-uniformity.

Abstract: Oral leukoplakia (OL) is the most common premalignancy in the oral cavity. The objective of this study was to investigate the biological role of transglutaminase 3 (TGM3) in malignant transformation of OL and its clinical value for predicting oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) risk in patients with OL. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure TGM3 expression in OL samples from 98 patients. Patient clinicopathological and follow-up data were analyzed. The TGM3 biological role in OL cells was investigated in gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays, and the TGM3 downregulated mechanism in OLs was characterized. TGM3 mRNA and protein expressions were frequently downregulated in OL cells and samples. DNA hypermethylation was a mechanism of TGM3 downregulation. TGM3 overexpression and silencing affected the proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis of OL cells through apoptosis-related protein dysregulations. Lower TGM3 levels were strongly associated with the grade of epithelial dysplasia and OSCC development. Multivariate analyses showed that TGM3 was the independent predictor for malignant transformation of OL. Collectively, these data indicated that TGM3 played an important role in OL malignant transformation and may serve as a predictor to identify OL with OSCC development.

Abstract: A template-based liquid phase deposition was applied to fabricate SnO2 nanotube arrays. The prepared SnO2 nanotube photocatalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), UV–Vis absorb spectrum, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements. The results showed that the well-crystalled rutile-SnO2 nanotube arrays with an inner diameter of about 60 nm and a wall thickness of about 20 nm can be fabricated at calcination temperature of 600 °C. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of the SnO2 nanotubes calcined at different temperatures for degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye under UV light illumination was investigated. The results clearly indicated that the samples calcined at 600 °C exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity, which makes them ideal for applications in environmental remediation. It was suggested that the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of the SnO2 nanotubes may be due to their high specific surface area as-well-as their increased crystallinity with increasing calcination temperature. On the basis of the characterization results, we proposed a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation on SnO2 nanotubes.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to construct DNA methylation-lncRNA-mRNA interaction trios in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We first conducted eQTL analyses using genome-wide methylation, lncRNA and mRNA expression data from 43 Chinese females. Next, causal inference test (CIT) was used to detect the lncRNA mediation effects on methylation and mRNA. Methylation-lncRNA cis-eQTL analysis identified 11 significant cis-methylation-lncRNA pairs. Combined with the results from the next lncRNA-mRNA eQTL and methylation-mRNA eQTL analyses, the 11 significant pairs and their corresponding 11,204 target e-mRNAs formed 12,245 trios. Further CIT identified six lncRNAs as mediators in regulating the corresponding pairs between methylation and mRNA. This study detected lncRNAs with mediation effects on the correlations between DNA methylations and a large number of mRNAs.

Abstract: Multi-junction solar cells are considered for various applications, as they tackle various loss mechanisms for single junction solar cells. These losses include thermalization and non-absorption below the band gap. In this work, a tandem configuration comprising copper-indium-gallium-di-selenide (CIGS) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) absorber layers is studied. Two main challenges are addressed in this work. Firstly, the natural roughness of CIGS is unfavorable for monolithically growing a high quality a-Si:H top cell. Some sharp textures in the CIGS induce shunts in the a-Si:H top junction, limiting the electrical performance of such a configuration. To smoothen this interface, the possibility of mechanically polishing the intermediate i-ZnO layer has been explored. The second challenge that is addressed, is the significant current mismatch in these tandem architectures. To enhance absorption in the current-limiting top cell, the ZnO:Al front electrode was textured by means of wet-etching the entire tandem stack. We demonstrated that one can manipulate the morphology of the random textures by varying the growth conditions of the ZnO:Al, leading to better light management in these devices.

Abstract: In this work, BiOCl1-xIx coated hollow glass microsphere was synthesized as a novel near infrared reflective pigment for superhydrophobic cool roof coatings. BiOCl1-xIx microflowers or microspheres were deposited on hollow glass microspheres using a simple chemical liquid deposition method. The morphologies of BiOCl1-xIx were found to differ drastically by varying the molar ratio of Cl to I. The color of the composite pigments changed from white to red and the band gap decreased from 3.16 eV to 1.87 eV as the increased content of I. The near infrared solar reflectance of the composite pigment was as high as 0.947. An approximately 8 °C decrease in outer surface temperature was obtained for the heat box coated with the composite pigments. With the help of the micro/nano-scale surface roughness of hollow glass microsphere/ BiOCl1-xIx composites, a superhydrophobic coating with a contact angle of 156.1° could be obtained. The superhydrophobic cool coating showed good antifouling property when they were fouled by the slurry solution containing montmorillonite and Rhodamine B. Moreover, the prepared superhydrophobic coatings exhibited long term stability and ultraviolet durability. Therefore, such superhydrophobic cool coatings with antifouling property is able to work for a longer time by preventing the contamination for building thermal insulation.

Abstract: Hot spotting is a reliability problem in photovoltaic (PV) panels where a mismatched cell heats up significantly and degrades PV panel output power performance. High PV cell temperature due to hot spotting can damage the cell encapsulate and lead to second breakdown, where both cause permanent damage to the PV panel. Therefore, the design and development of a hot spot mitigation technique is proposed using a simple, low-cost and reliable hot spot activation technique. The hot spots in the examined PV system is detected using FLIR i5 thermal imaging camera. Several experiments have been studied during various environmental conditions, where the PV module P-V curve was evaluated in each observed test to analyze the output power performance before and after the activation of the proposed hot spot mitigation technique. One PV module affected by hot spot was tested. The output power increased by approximate to 3.6 W after the activation of the hot spot mitigation technique. Additional test has been carried out while connecting the hot spot PV module in series with two other PV panels. The results indicate that there is an increase of 3.57 W in the output power after activating the hot spot mitigation technique.

Abstract: The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is mainly expressed in the nervous system and regulates learning, memory processes, pain and energy metabolism. However, there is no way to directly measure its activation. In this study, we constructed a CB1 intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor, which could measure CB1 activation by monitoring structural changes between the third intracellular loop and the C-terminal tail. CB1 agonists induced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in the FRET signal, corresponding to a reduction in the distance between the third intracellular loop and the C-terminal tail. This, in turn, mobilized intracellular Ca2+, inhibited cAMP accumulation, and increased phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinases. The activation kinetics detected using this method were consistent with those from previous reports. Moreover, the increased FRET signal was markedly inhibited by the CB1 antagonist rimonabant, which also reduced phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinases. We mutated a single cysteine residue in the sensor (at position 257 or 264) to alanine. Both mutation reduced the agonist-induced increase in FRET signal and structural changes in the CB1 receptor, which attenuated phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinases. In summary, our sensor directly assesses the kinetics of CB1 activation in real-time and can be used to monitor CB1 structure and function.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence suggested that tumor-associated macrophages played crucial roles in the progression of endometrial cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the role of lncRNA NIFK-AS1 in M2-like polarization of macrophages and further to investigate the effect of NIFK-AS1 modulating macrophage polarization on the proliferation, migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor-associated macrophages were isolated from healthy volunteers and endometrial cancer patients, respectively. The expression of NIFK-AS1 and miR-146a were detected by qRT-PCR in tumor-associated macrophages or THP-1 monocytes differentiated macrophages. The expression of NIFK-AS1 and miR-146a were decreased and increased in tumor-associated macrophages of endometrial cancer patients, respectively. NIFK-AS1 overexpression suppressed the IL-4-induced M2 polarization of THP-1 macrophages. Moreover, we found that NIFK-AS1 overexpression inhibited the 17β-estradiol-induced proliferation, migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells through suppressing M2-like polarization of macrophages. NIFK-AS1 could interact with miR-146a and increased the expression of Notch1 through downregulating miR-146a. Further experiments revealed that miR-146a overexpression attenuated the effect of NIFK-AS1 on suppressing the M2 polarization of macrophages and the estrogen-induced proliferation, migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells. These findings indicated that NIFK-AS1 inhibited the M2-like polarization of macrophages via targeting miR-146a, thereby reducing the estrogen-induced proliferation, migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells. Our study highlights the important role of NIFK-AS1 in regulating the polarization and function of tumor-associated macrophages in endometrial cancer and provides novel insight into the TAMs-mediated progression of endometrial cancer.

Abstract: CH3NH3PbI3-based planar perovskite solar cells were fabricated by slot-die coating, a scalable method. Slot-die coating tends to produce perovskite layers with much lower coverage with overgrown crystals than spin coating, which does not include a self-drying mechanism in the process. To mimic the self-drying behavior inherent in spin coating, the present study introduces a blowing step in the slot-die coating method, which significantly improved coverage of the prepared slot-die coated perovskite films. The slot-die-coated device with blowing showed a moderate power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.8%. The morphology of the slot-die-coated perovskite film is further improved by optimizing the deposition temperature. The combination of blowing and heating during the slot-die-coating step and the introduction of a printing-friendly hole transport layer resulted in a PCE of 12.7% for the devices fabricated in air.

Abstract: This paper presents a new kind of KNO3–NaNO3–LiNO3–Ca(NO3)2·4H2O with certain proportion, which is potentially suitable for high-temperature thermal energy storage in concentrating solar power technology. Its primary thermophysical properties were evaluated. Thermal physical tests were conducted for the samples obtained at different stages during the tests of 1,200-h exposure to constant high temperature and thermal shock cycling for 1000 times. Results show that a comprehensive grasp of the time evolution of its thermophysical properties and their respective changes with heating time and thermal cycles were achieved. The thermophysical properties of the molten salt show good repeatability before and after the experiments, and most variations are within ± 10%. In addition, the normal temperature X-ray diffraction diagram of the candidate was measured and analyzed after 1200h of heating and 1000 times of thermal cycling. Although part of calcium nitrates has been dissolved and formed a new solution, this phenomenon does not affect the performance of the candidates, which showed high-temperature tolerance and good thermal stability. Therefore, this new kind of molten salt thermal storage materials is a promising candidate for both heat transfer and energy storage in large-scale solar thermal power plants.

Abstract: With record power conversion efficiencies of hybrid perovskite solar cells now exceeding 20% under laboratory conditions, improvements in stability of the cells under real-world working conditions are now key requirements for their commercial success. Here, we present a novel strategy to reduce penetration of humidity and oxygen into perovskite films via incorporation of a diammonium glycol. The two ammonium groups of this molecule allow it to serve as a crosslinker in the structure, bridging two unit cells within a crystallite or even across a grain boundary. In a planar heterojunction solar cell containing PCBM as an electron transport layer, the power conversion efficiency of the cell with ~0.1% diammonium glycol in the absorber layer was 13.96%, slightly exceeding that of the glycol-free device (13.53%). Most importantly, the glycol-free device exhibited the typical growth in hysteresis with performance degradation, but hysteresis remained suppressed in the device doped with diammonium glycol, even as its overall performance deteriorated. Futhermore, the chemical stability of the unpackaged device under continuous AM1.5G illumination at ambient conditions was substantially improved relative to the glycol-free device. Formation of PbI2 was significantly suppressed, which could minimize release of toxic Pb ions.

Abstract: Hybrid nanofluids are a novel class of colloidal fluids which have drawn significant attention due to potential tailoring of their thermo-physical properties for heat transfer enhancement by a combination of more than one nano-additive to meet specific requirements of an application. In the present work, ceramic copper oxide/carbon (SiO2-CuO/C) nanoparticles in 80:20 (wt%) composition were prepared by ultrasonic-assisted wet mixing technique. The hybrid nanofluid was formulated by dispersing the nanoparticles into a base fluid mixture of 60:40 (% by mass) glycerol and ethylene glycol (G/EG) using the two-steps method. The influence of nanoparticles on the augmentation of specific heat, thermal conductivity and viscosity was examined in the volume concentration range of 0.5–2.0% in the temperature range of 303.15–353.15K. The results demonstrate that the synthesized SiO2-CuO/C hybrid nanoparticles enhanced the thermo-physical properties of the base fluid mixture which is higher than using SiO2 alone. In the case of SiO2–G/EG nanofluid, the specific heat capacity decremented by a maximum value of 5.7% whereas the thermal conductivity and viscosity incremented by 6.9% and 1.33-times as compared with G/EG at maximum volume concentration of 2.0% at a temperature of 353.15K. Comparatively, a reinforcement of 80% SiO2 with 20% CuO/C in G/EG mixture led to thermal conductivity and viscosity enhancement by 26.9% and 1.15-times, respectively with a significant reduction of specific heat by 21.1%. New empirical correlations were proposed based on the experimental data for evaluation of thermophysical properties.

Abstract: Post-natal skeletal muscle growth in mice is very rapid and involves complex changes in many cells types over the first 6 weeks of life. The acute onset of dystropathology also occurs around 3 weeks of age in the mdx mouse model of the human disease Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). This study investigated (i) alterations in expression patterns of regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in vivo, including miRNAs, lncRNAs and tRNAs, during early growth of skeletal muscles in normal control C57Bl/10Scsn (C57) compared with dystrophic mdx mice from 2 to 6 weeks of postnatal age, and revealed inherent differences in vivo for levels of 3 ncRNAs between C57 and mdx muscles before the onset of dystropathology. Since the amino acid taurine has many benefits and reduces disease severity in mdx mice, this study also (ii) determined the impact of taurine treatment on these expression patterns in mdx muscles at the onset of dystropathology (3 weeks) and after several bouts of myonecrosis and regeneration (6 weeks). Taurine treatment of mdx mice only altered ncRNA levels when administered from 18 days to 6 weeks of age, but a deficiency in tRNA levels was rectified earlier in mdx skeletal muscles treated from 14 days to 3 weeks. Myogenesis in tissue culture was also used to (iii) compare ncRNA expression patterns for both strains, and (iv) the response to taurine treatment. These analyses revealed intrinsic differences in ncRNA expression patterns during myogenesis between strains, as well as increased sensitivity of mdx ncRNA levels to taurine treatment.

Abstract: Milk lipids, important for infant growth and development, are produced and secreted by mammary gland under the regulation of steroid hormones, growth factors, and microRNAs (miRNAs). miR-221 has been identified in milk and adipocytes and it plays important roles in regulating normal mammary epithelial hierarchy and breast cancer stem cells; however, its roles in lipid metabolism in mammary epithelial cells (MECs), the cells of lipid synthesis and secretion, are as yet unknown. Through overexpression or inhibition of miR-221 expression, we found that it regulated lipid metabolism in MECs and was expressed differentially at various stages during murine mammary gland development. Inhibition of miR-221 expression increased lipid content in MECs through elevation of the lipid synthesis enzyme FASN, while overexpression of miR-221 reduced MEC lipid content. Moreover, the steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone decreased miR-221 expression with a subsequent increase in lipid formation in MECs. The expression of miR-221 was lower during lactation, which suggests that it may be involved in milk production. Therefore, miR-221 might be a useful target for influencing milk lipid production.

Abstract: A comparison of performance parameters for first, second and third generation PV technologies has been conducted. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules displayed markedly different outdoor performance characteristics to other PV technologies owing to the positive temperature coefficient, lower thermal mass and response under low light conditions. The linear relationship between irradiance and module temperature rise above ambient is studied, leading to calculation of values for the Ross coefficient for OPV modules. OPVs are shown to possess a lower Ross coefficient than poly-Si, due to the lower absorption of infrared radiation. The effect of wind speed on the Ross coefficient is also investigated, showing the effect that module structure has upon outdoor PV performance, with the OPV module cooling quicker under windy conditions than the poly-Si due to a lower thermal mass. A long term stability study on OPV modules with a silver nanowire-zinc oxide (AgNW-ZnO) composite front electrode has showed two phases of degradation: a short initial burn-in with significant drops in performance; followed by stabilisation and degradation progressing at a much slower rate. During the burn-in period the modules showed diurnal reversible degradation in the short circuit current (ISC), whereas open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) show a steady decline. The reversible degradation is assumed to be related to the desorption of oxygen from the ZnO layer during the day due to UV excitation, leading to an increase in trap formation and a drop in current generation capacity, followed by re-adsorption of the oxygen overnight.

Abstract: Multijunction solar cells, proven technological route for achievements of highest PV conversion efficiencies, require accurate tuning of the sub-cell absorption to ensure that every cell in the stack delivers the same current density. Even though currents of the sub-cells can be precisely matched for a fixed illumination spectrum, current mismatch cannot be avoided in real terrestrial applications due to variations of the irradiance spectrum. The issue becomes critical when a solar cell has to cover wider range of applications such as a mixture of direct sun / shadow / artificial light – the case for various distributed PV-powered electronics. Furthermore the current matching constrains choice of materials and designs of sub-cells for a tandem device. A straightforward basic configuration with decoupling the sub-cell's currents is a 3-terminal configuration with one additional contact sheared by the top and bottom cell. This concept requires voltage-matching between the top and bottom cell when these cells are integrated in modules. A realistic concept for the voltage-matched 3-terminal cell reported recently includes a wide gap top cell combined with a tandem bottom cell made of 2 sub-cells with lower bandgaps. The concept is a hybrid between 2 and 3-terminal configurations with voltage matching and relaxed current matching constrains. Established thin film silicon solar cell technology provides interesting option to realize the hybrid 3-terminal cell with amorphous Si top cell (VOC ≈ 0.9 V) and two microcrystalline Si cells (VOC ≈ 0.5 V). In this work we present proof of concept of the voltage matched 3-terminal tandem cell prepared with highly transparent and conductive IOH intermediate contact. The efficiency of 10.4% has been achieved made up of independently operating 7.9% efficient top cell and 2.5% efficient bottom tandem cell. The paper summarizes the development and discusses optical losses identified in the 3-T devices.

Abstract: A theoretical approach based on the Matthiessen rule for scattering lifetime is presented to formulate the effective characteristics of polycrystalline solar cells. Application of this method to Perovskite solar cells obtains polycrystalline bulk defect density for diverse grain sizes along with the determination of surface recombination velocity at grain boundaries. Unlike previous works on Silicon based solar cells that use an independently weighted average equation for extracting mobility, we introduce a variation of Drude-Smith model for calculating the mobility from carrier lifetime and defect density. In agreement with the experiments, introduced method reveals sub-picosecond background scattering times associated with phonon-lattice vibrations. Obtained carrier diffusion length spans over multi-micron to multi-millimeter scale for grain sizes ranging from 100 nm to 1 mm. Calculated monomolecular recombination lifetimes explains elevated Photoluminescence Yield and peak position in larger grain sizes. Presented method is verified by feeding extracted parameters into Drift-Diffusion equations and fitting with reported experimental photovoltaic conversion efficiency data. Finally, through employing a Gaussian distribution for grain sizes, we also study the reduction of device efficiency caused by non-uniform grain size distribution as a more realistic case.

Abstract: CuBi2O4 is regarded as p-type candidate for photoelectrochemical water splitting due to its attractive thermodynamic and band structure features. In this work, we present the optimization of CuBi2O4 thin films synthesized by electrodeposition method on FTO glass substrate. CuBi2O4/BiVO4 heterojunction were further fabricated by depositing BiVO4 on CuBi2O4 with pulsed laser deposition method. The influence of parameters such as the electrodeposition time and pulse count of PLD deposition on performance of the heterojunctions was studied. The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, SEM, UV–Vis and electrochemical properties. The optimal deposition condition for CuBi2O4 sample was found to be electrodeposition for 20 min and annealing at 500 °C for 4 h. Pulse laser deposition (PLD) was used for the first time to deposit BiVO4 on CuBi2O4 to form p-n heterojunction. The photoelectrochemical behavior study of sample with different BiVO4 thin film thickness showed that the optimal photocurrent is − 0.25 mA/cm2 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6), which is doubled comparing to that of the bare CuBi2O4 film.

Abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is not just a thin film deposition technology limited to the semiconductor IC industries to grow high-k gate dielectric or a Cu diffusion barrier layer. In recent times, it has found plenty of applications in the field of renewable energy due to its precise thickness control up to few angstroms and its unique feature of conformal and uniform coating on any randomly shaped 3D structure. ALD has far-reaching applications in this field, including electrochemical storage, fuel cells, solar photovoltaics (PV), and catalysis for water splitting to produce H2 as a green fuel. In solar PV technology, ALD is now being extensively used as an efficient tool to deposit surface passivation layers, absorber or sensitizer, transparent conducting oxide, and barrier and buffer layers in several kinds of solar cells. Out of all the different layers associated with a solar cell, ALD is majorly used for the development of a very thin n-type buffer layer. This review article presents a systematic chronological study on such ALD-grown buffer layers for thin film solar cells (TSFCs). The study is carried out in detail based on different earth-abundant absorber materials, such as Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe), Cu2O and SnS, for which ALD is successfully used to deposit the buffer layer.

Abstract: Annealing dependent absorption and quantum efficiency spectra are determined on femtosecond-laser, sulfur hyperdoped silicon solar cells in a spectral range from 300 to 2500 nm. Although the samples, which are rapidly quenched after annealing at T = 1250 °C, do not feature the highest sub-bandgap absorption, the highest sub-bandgap quantum efficiency is measured on the same level as on non-annealed samples, featuring the highest sub-bandgap absorption. Findings on annealing dependent absorption are carried over, in order to explain the measured quantum efficiency spectra. In the sub-bandgap spectral range conversion is more efficient, when deep sulfur centers are obtained from annealing at higher temperatures at preferably rapid quenching. For those annealing regimes the above-bandgap quantum efficiency is decreased, which is ascribed to less shallow sulfur donors. Lower temperatures or slow cooling rates results in shallow donors, featuring a more efficient conversion in the above-bandgap spectral range. This is on the expense of deep sulfur centers and the corresponding sub-bandgap conversion ability. Therewith it is concluded, that the main absorption occurs only in the laser-induced sulfur emitter layer. Furthermore, to some extent a prediction is proposed on sulfur hyperdoped silicon prepared by ion implantation and subsequent pulsed laser melting, featuring rapid cooling from the melt.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is defined by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with PD although it is not fully understood how neurons respond to these stresses. How adaptive and apoptotic neuronal stress response pathways are regulated and the thresholds at which they are activated remains ambiguous. Utilising SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, we show that MAPK/AP-1 pathways are critical in regulating the response to mitochondrial uncoupling. Here we found the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun can act in either a pro- or anti-apoptotic manner, depending on the level of stress. JNK-mediated cell death in differentiated cells only occurred once a threshold of stress was surpassed. We also identified a novel feedback loop between Parkin activity and the c-Jun response, suggesting defective mitophagy may initiate MAPK/c-Jun-mediated neuronal loss observed in PD. Our data supports the hypothesis that blocking cell death pathways upstream of c-Jun as a therapeutic target in PD may not be appropriate due to crossover of the pro- and anti-apoptotic responses. Boosting adaptive responses or targeting specific aspects of the neuronal death response may therefore represent more viable therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Recently, studies on ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) have revealed their potentials for achieving the improved device performances. However, owing to the trade-off between the short-circuit current density JSC) and open circuit voltage (VOC), the mismatch of the energy levels between donors and acceptors leads to a large energy loss and then leads to a lower VOC in most ternary systems. In this study, we incorporated 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)− 5-methylindanone)− 5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b’]-dithiophene (IT-M) into a PTB7-Th:PC71BM host system as the third component, which has a higher energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) than that of PC71BM. The introduction of IT-M adjusts the energy-level cascade, enhances the absorption intensity and modulates the film morphology, which facilitate the charge generation, enhance the charge transport, and suppress the charge recombination, as manifested by the significantly enhanced VOC, JSC, and fill factor (FF). Therefore, the results indicate that a simultaneous enhancement of VOC, JSC, and FF can be achieved by incorporation of IT-M in ternary OSCs, providing a higher efficiency.

Abstract: Controlling the concentration of charge carriers near the surface is essential for solar cells. It permits to form regions with selective conductivity for either electrons or holes and it also helps to reduce the rate at which they recombine. Chemical passivation of the surfaces is equally important, and it can be combined with population control to implement carrier-selective, passivating contacts for solar cells. This paper discusses different approaches to suppress surface recombination and to manipulate the concentration of carriers by means of doping, work function and charge. It also describes some of the many surface-passivating contacts that are being developed for silicon solar cells, restricted to experiments performed by the authors.

Abstract: In high efficient planar perovskite solar cells (PSC), electron transportation layer (ETL) plays an important role in its photovoltaic performance. Except for TiO2, Nb2O5 has also been considered as ideal electron selective layer material for planar perovskite solar cell due to its excellent optical transmittance and similar Femi level with TiO2. Herein, we report niobium oxide film deposited by a simple and low temperature solution method, as an effective alternative to high temperature sintered TiO2 film in the regular architecture of PSC. Nb2O5 modification of FTO has successfully tuned the surface work function from 4.59 eV to 4.28 eV without obviously affecting the surface roughness and optical transmittance, which could significantly decrease energy level offset and improve the open voltage. Appropriate UV ozone treatment could adjust the surface hydrophilicity of Nb2O5 film benefiting the growth of perovskite films on low temperature solution deposited Nb2O5 coated FTO substrate. Relatively high efficiency over 17% with less J–V hysteresis has been achieved by optimizing the precursor solution, spin rate, annealing temperature and UV ozone treatment time. The results indicate low temperature solution deposited Nb2O5 film can be a low cost and easy-prepared ETL material for high performance PSC.

Abstract: The future of third generation Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) can be optimistic if concerns of charge recombination and stability of cells can be worked upon. In this work, we report the role of Graphene materials in its different dimension in overcoming recombination and enhancing power conversion efficiency (PCE). Composite of Graphene oxide nanoribbons (GNRs) synthesized by oxidative unzipping of multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was used as an effective electron transport layer with TiO2 as photo anode in QDSSCs. The best performing TiO2-GNR showed a significant enhancement in PCE of 3.7% for CdS based quantum dots, apart from increased efficiency reported earlier. Investigation of design of anode material reveals that the enhanced surface area and active sites of partially conducting GNRs facilitated uniform deposition of Titania particles (TiO2) with less aggregation, excellent mobility, presence of organic functional group for anchor of TiO2, its 1D quasi structure add to enhanced electron transport (less resistance).

Abstract: Photovoltaic MoS2/Si nanowire array (SiNWA) heterojunction photodetectors (PDs) are constructed and investigated, which exhibit excellent photoresponse properties to light illumination at wavelengths from the deep ultraviolet to the near-infrared. Further photoresponse analysis reveals that a high responsivity of 53.5 A/W and a specific detectivity of 2.8 × 1013 Jones, as well as fast response speeds of 2.9/7.3 μs at 50 kHz are achieved in a MoS2/SiNWA heterojunction device. The high performances could be attributed to the high-quality heterojunction between MoS2 and the SiNWA. Such high performances of MoS2/SiNWA PDs are much better than those of previously reported MoS2-based PDs, suggesting that MoS2/SiNWA heterojunction devices have great potential in optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: A mixed polymeric emulsifier consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene glycol-600 (PEG-600) was explored for preparing high-performance phase change material emulsions (PCMEs) containing the paraffin with a melting point of 62–64°C. After the effects of the mass ratio of PVA to PEG-600, the mass ratio of the mixed emulsifier to the paraffin and the homogenization rate on the size distribution, viscosity and dispersion stability of the PCMEs containing 20wt% paraffin were systematically investigated, the optimal emulsifying process parameters have been determined to be the mass ratio of PVA to PEG-600 of 50:50, the mass ratio of the mixed emulsifier to paraffin of 1:5 and the homogenization rate of 10,000rpm. Accordingly, the PCMEs with the paraffin mass fractions varying from 10wt% to 30wt% were prepared. It is found that the paraffin has been well dispersed in water in the form of sphere-like droplets with average diameters ranging from 3µm to 11µm in the obtained PCMEs. Significantly, the PCMEs with different mass fractions of the paraffin exhibit no supercooling, owing to the function of the mixed polymeric emulsifier as a nucleating agent. The apparent specific heat of PCMEs are 1.51–2.18 times as high as that of water at the phase transition temperature region, due to the existent of the paraffin in them. Their apparent thermal conductivity gradually decreases with an increase in the mass fraction of the paraffin, while the viscosity increases significantly with mass fraction of the paraffin at the same temperatures. Furthermore, the pumping power consumption of the PCMEs shows a drastic reduction as compared to that of water at the same heat storage capacity. It is revealed that the PCMEs show great potential for use as a novel heat transfer fluid (HTF) in thermal energy storage (TES) systems.

Abstract: Interfacial engineering plays a very significant role in suppressing charge recombination and improving the photovoltaic performance in solar cells. The introduction of a buffer or passivation layer is an effective way to modify interfacial behaviours. In this paper, a new approach involving the deposition of a MnS passivation layer was studied to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of CdS/CdSe quantum dot co-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). Compared to the pure CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells, the introduction of the MnS passivation layer can not only modify the surface defects of the quantum dots and suppress charge recombination at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, but also enhance the light harvesting capability in terms of both the absorbance intensity and absorption range. This work may provide inspiration for future studies on the interfacial modification of QDSSCs. The best device performance with a ZnO photoanode could be achieved when the MnS passivation layer was deposited for 1 min for each of two successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) cycles. The PCE, open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) were 3.70%, 0.60 V, 13.74 mA cm−2, and 0.44, respectively.

Abstract: In the current study pre-formed geopolymer half shells were fabricated from a combination of fly ash and black slag. Five (5) geopolymer shells were filled with a chloride-based phase change material (PCM) with a melting point of 540°C for use in a high temperature thermal energy storage system (TESS). Additionally, three (3) of these shells contained an inner coating of alumina (various manufacturers) while another geopolymer shell was pre-fired at 610°C. The half shells were cycled around the melting point of the PCM (500–580°C) for five (5) cycles, with the mass change of the samples recorded. Of the five (5) samples only the Aremco-coated sample suffered less PCM loss than the control. Furthermore, the melting point and latent heat of PCM samples from the geopolymer half shells were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to find if degradation occurs. In all samples the PCM melting point was not affected while the latent heat was significantly affected. Additionally, the Aremco-coated sample resulted in PCM segregation.

Abstract: Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) is a leading cause of morbidity in premature newborns and is a common reason for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Recent studies found that the pathogenesis of NRDS is not simply lung immaturity. Apoptosis is an essential process for the development and maturation of the lungs. In this study, we report a critical role of lncRNA MALAT1 in regulating CD80 transcription in the NRDS-associated apoptosis via binding with NF-κB. We first showed MALAT1 and CD80 were highly expressed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of NRDS with infection exposure. Then we found MALAT1 expressions were significantly increased by the treatment of LPS. We confirmed knockdown of MALAT1 promoted cell viability by CCK-8 assays, cell apoptosis by flow cytometric assays and cytoskeleton destruction by immunocytochemistry. We confirmed CD80 expression level was associated with cell apoptosis by affecting PARP and caspase-3. Then we demonstrated knockdown of MALAT1 promoted CD80 transcription in A549 cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that MALAT1 downregulated transcriptional expression of CD80 by interfering with NF-κB activation and disrupting its binding efficiency with the CD80 promoter in the cell nucleus. In conclusion, we first identified lncRNA MALAT1 as an important prognosis maker for NRDS patients. Most significantly, this study then demonstrated a novel regulatory function of knocked-down MALAT1 on the transcriptional level of CD80 by enhancing the binding of NF-κB to CD80 promoter. Since the interaction between MALAT1 and CD80 plays an essential role in the cell apoptosis of NRDS, our findings demonstrate the possibility of using MALAT1 as therapeutic target for treatment of NRDS, and extend existing knowledge about the molecular mechanism that underlies NRDS pathogensis.

Abstract: A direct mapping of photovoltage in a complete Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/ZnO/Al:ZnO solar cell device is carried out using Kelvin probe force microscopic (KPFM) measurements in surface and junction modes. Four cells having different values of open circuit voltage (VOC) have been studied, and nanoscale variation of photovoltage have been obtained from the difference of surface potential (SP) images in the two modes. The maps exhibit a higher photovoltage at grain boundaries in general. Observed SP image of pristine CZTSe layer reveals downward band bending resulting in reduction of carrier recombination, and thus, lower Jdark at grain boundaries (GB). The observed downward band bending resulting in low Jdark at GB in CZTSe layer is used to explain the increase in photovoltage (VOC) at the GB. KPFM measurements of CZTSe and CZTSe/CdS layers show that the surface potential of CZTSe layer and its variation can be affected by CdS deposition and further device processing, in addition to surface adsorption and contamination effects. The photovoltage mapping obtained from Kelvin probe force microscopic measurements on the final device without any interfering effects, is an important advantage of the present method.

Abstract: In this work, an efficient and stable inverted planar perovskite solar cell (PSC) with water additive has been prepared in ambient air. Adding moderate water additive to CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution leads to growth in quality of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film, because the boiling point of water is lower than that of N, N-dimethylformamide. The annealing temperature of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film is controlled to 105°C (slightly higher than the boiling point of water) to obtain the dense perovskite film rapidly in ambient environment with ~ 40% relative humidity. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSC with water additive is 14.02%, higher than that (11.17%) of the reference device without water additive. In addition, the aqueous CH3NH3PbI3−xClx solution is transformed into the stable perovskite film through the method of rapid annealing. The stable CH3NH3PbI3−xClx·nH2O system can resist the decomposition of perovskite film and weaken iodide ion migration in PSCs, which enhance stability of the device under the atmospheric environment. After being stored in the air for 120h, the PSC device with water additive still has an PCE of 12.01%, higher than that (1.64%) of the reference device.

Abstract: In this study, a novel microencapsulated phase change material, paraffin@Cu-Cu2O, was prepared by a hydrothermal method. The diameters of the microcapsules were 600–900 nm. The micro morphology, chemical compositions, phase change properties, and thermal stability of the products were characterized. It was calculated that the encapsulation efficiency of the microencapsulated paraffin@Cu-Cu2O composite was 62.79%. The melting temperature and freezing temperature of products were close to those of paraffin, but the products had better thermal stability and higher thermal conductivity because of the metal shell materials. Additionally, we compared the paraffin@Cu-Cu2O slurry with paraffin emulsion, and we found that the slurry had better light absorbing properties, thermal conductivity, and photo-thermal conversion performance. The developed material is a promising candidate for application in direct absorption solar collector systems.

Abstract: We report the synthesis of a novel nanohybrid based on nickel sulfide (NiS) nanoparticles decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) following a facile hydrothermal approach for application as Pt-free counter electrode (CE) in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC). The DSSC devices fabricated using this NiS/rGO nanohybrid film as CE showed an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.5% and a fill factor of about 0.78 when illuminated by AM 1.5 G simulated solar light. These values are well above those reported previously for DSSCs fabricated with Pt free CE and thus establishes the potential of the NiS/rGO nanohybrid as an excellent low-cost CE material for DSSC fabrication. The improvement in the PCE is due to improved electro-catalytic activity of the NiS/rGO nanohybrid for reduction of the triiodide caused by the synergistic effects of highly catalytic NiS nanoparticles and electrically conductive rGO.

Abstract: Oxygen-related defects in the intrinsic metal-oxide films restrict the transportation and collection processes of photogenerated carriers from the perovskite film to charge transport layers, which obstruct the applications of metal-oxide films in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, fluorine as an anion dopant was introduced to modify the oxygen-related defects in the intrinsic zinc oxide (ZnO). The impact of fluorine concentration on the structural, electrical, and optical characteristics of solution-processed ZnO films was systematically investigated. When the fluorine concentration was optimized to 15%, fluorine-doped ZnO (ZnO:F) film exhibited multiple advantageous effects, such as large crystalline size, low oxygen-related defect state density, good hydrophobic surface, and high conductivity. Furthermore, ZnO:F films with various fluorine concentrations as electron transport layers (ETLs) were introduced into the PSCs. The PSCs based on the ZnO:F ETL with the fluorine concentration of 15% yielded a maximum power conversion efficiency of 16.23% owing to the improvements of short-circuit current and fill factor. Meanwhile, the thermochemical stability of the device based on the ZnO:F ETL was also significantly improved.
