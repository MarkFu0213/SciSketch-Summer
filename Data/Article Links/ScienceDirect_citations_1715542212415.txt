Abstract: In this study, two components based polyethylene glycol (PEG)/thermosetting solid-solid phase change material composites as novel form stable phase change material (FSPCM) were successfully prepared via free-radical polymerization. One of the components consists of PEG-based polyurethane acrylate prepolymer and extra pristine PEG. Another component is made up of 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate and benzoyl peroxide. The extra pristine PEG with low viscosity at melting state was used as diluents to decline the melting viscosity of PUA and served as phase change functional chains of the FSPCMs, endowing the FSPCM with high latent heats and flexible application ability for thermal energy storage. The chemical structure, crystalline performances, phase change properties and thermal reliability and stability of prepared FSPCMs were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, polarizing optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry analysis, respectively. The leakage test results show that the maximum content of PEG in novel FSPCM without any leakage above the melting point of PEG is 85wt%. The DSC analysis results show that the novel FSPCMs have high latent heats and the latent heats efficiency of novel FSPCMs is significantly higher than that of the traditional FSPCMs. The prepared FSPCMs exhibit good thermal reliability and stability from the thermal cycling test and TG analysis.

Abstract: A Si quantum dot (QD) heterojunction solar cell with a p-type Si QD layer on an n-type crystalline Si wafer was developed, and the effect of the boron (B)-doping profile in the Si QD layer was investigated. The doping concentration of B in the p-type Si QD layer was optimized at 5.71×1021 atoms/cm3, and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.15% was achieved at the optimized B concentration. A Si QD solar cell having a Si QD layer with a double-step B-doping profile was suggested to enhance the vertical charge carrier transport in the Si QD layer. As a result of the B-doping profile change from a single-step to double-step, the PCE of the Si QD solar cell was increased from 14.41% to 14.98%. In the Si QD solar cell with a double-step B-doping profile, quantum efficiency analysis showed that the improvement in short circuit current within short wavelength region under 650nm can be related with the additional built-in E-field caused by the band structure modification.

Abstract: Thermal Energy Storage systems are acknowledged solutions frequently used for reducing indoor thermal fluctuations by behaving as thermal buffer. In this view, phase change materials (PCMs) are included into building envelope components. At the same time, cool roofs represent passive cooling techniques aimed at maximizing the solar radiation reflected by the roof without contributing to the indoor overheating, in hot summer conditions, in particular. In this panorama, the authors developed a new composite material made by a polyurethane liquid waterproof cool membrane with non-capsulated PCMs acting as shape stabilized thermal buffer additive. In this work, the behaviour of such composite material when exposed to accelerated weathering long-term tests (QUV test) has been studied. Temperature, humidity and ultraviolet radiation are varied in order to test the membrane vulnerability to realistic environmental conditions. The purpose of such experimental analysis was to clarify if the PCM inclusion could help the membrane to better behave during the course of the time, since PCMs are supposed to be responsible for thermal stress reduction. Optic-energy, morphology, thermal and mechanical tests are carried out in order to analyse the membrane degradation imputable to the weathering stress. The inclusion of PCMs in different concentrations allowed identifying the best performing PCM-doping inclusion, i.e. 25wt%. Such composition, in fact, was able to register a better spectral reflectance reflectance in the near infrared region of the solar spectrum up to 10% with the fewest modification during the course of the QUV test, i.e. 7% of weight loss after 60 days of exposure, and to preserve the required flexibility of the membrane together with its superficial finishing characteristics.

Abstract: Glutamate is an essential excitatory neurotransmitter that regulates brain functions, and its activity is tightly regulated by glutamate transporters. Excess glutamate in the synaptic cleft and dysfunction of excitatory amino acid transporters have been shown to be involved in development of Alzheimer’s disease, but the precise regulatory mechanism is poorly understood. Using a D-[3H]-aspartic acid uptake assay, we found that Aβ1-42 oligomers impaired glutamate uptake in astrocytes and neurons. In astrocytes, this process was accompanied by reduced expression of GLT-1 and GLAST as detected by Western blot and immunocytofluorescence. However, mRNA levels of EAATs detected by qPCR in astrocytes and neurons were not altered, which suggests that this process is post-translational. Co-localization analysis using immunocytofluorescence showed that ubiquitylation of GLT-1 significantly increased. Therefore, we hypothesized that Aβ1-42 oligomers-induced endocytosis of astrocytic GLT-1 may be involved in ubiquitylation. In addition, Aβ1-42 oligomers enhanced secretion of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 into culture supernatant, which may be correlated with an inflammatory response and altered EAATs expression or function in Alzheimer’s disease. These findings support the idea that dysregulation of the glutamatergic system may play a significant role in pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, enhancing expression or function of EAATs in astrocytes and neurons might be a new therapeutic approach in treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: In this work, the corrosion behavior of Ni-based alloys including Inconel 625(In625), Hastelloy X(H X) and Hastelloy B-3(H B-3) alloys were investigated in a molten salt NaCl-CaCl2-MgCl2 by gravimetric methods. The corrosion test was conducted at 600°C for a maximum immersion time of 3 weeks. The corrosion behavior was determined by measuring the mass loss of samples at different time intervals. The corrosion products and morphology were investigated in detail via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The microscopic area element analysis in corrosion surface and the mapping diagram of element distribution from corrosion profile were carried out by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The results show that In625 alloy resists corrosion better than H X and H B-3 alloys in molten salt NaCl-CaCl2-MgCl2 in the presence of air. The corrosion profile in In625 and H X alloy show a poor Cr zone in the inner corrosion layer, probably caused through the outward diffusion of CrCl4(g) which is forecasted the formation by thermodynamic calculation. MgCr2O4 attached to the In625 and H X alloys specimens surface formed a compact protective layer and thus resist corrosion well. Thin and uniform corrosion layer was observed from profile in H B-3 alloy after immersed in NaCl-CaCl2-MgCl2 molten salt when air was present, however there is not a poor Cr zone in corrosion profile of H B-3 alloy. From above, the corrosion rate of Ni and Mo in alloy dominates the corrosion rate. Certain amount of Cr in the nickel-based alloys enhanced its corrosion resistance in molten salt NaCl-CaCl2-MgCl2, even if Ni and Mo in nickel-based alloys shows more stable performance in the corrosion test in chloride molten salt.

Abstract: An oxalic acid dihydrate/boric acid (OCD-BA) binary eutectic mixtures containing 88wt% OCD and 12wt% BA was investigated as a novel phase change material (PCM) with high latent heat and thermal stability. The solid-liquid phase diagram of binary systems is established, and the phase change temperature of OCD-BA binary eutectic mixture is 87.3°C and the latent heats of the melting and crystallization process are 344Jg−1 and 262Jg−1, respectively. Its thermophysical properties and thermal stability were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Scanning electron microscopy-Energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Its thermal stability was investigated in situ through 100 cycles using DSC and 1000 thermal cycling tests using Refrigerated and heating circulators (RHC). The latent heat of melting still exceed 280Jg−1 after 1000 heating/cooling cycles. The heat release platform sustained 5h at more than 70.0°C, and the degree of supercooling was only 1.0°C according to T-history method. These results indicate that the newly prepared OCD-BA binary eutectic mixture is a potential PCM for thermal storage tanks.

Abstract: Increasing photocatalytic application of KTaO3 motivated us to find efficient strategy to reduce its band gap, so that it can better utilize the solar spectrum. In this study, the effect of (N, Mo/W) pair on the electronic structure of KTaO3 has been investigated using density functional theory. The experimental band gap of KTaO3 (3.6eV) has been successfully reproduced (3.61eV) by employing hybrid functional proposed by Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof. The present study reveals that the dopant elements individually can reduce the band gap either by introducing localized unoccupied states or occupied states in between valence band and conduction band. Unfortunately, these localized states in combination with charge compensating vacancy defects may reduce the photoconversion efficiency. In case of codoping with (N, Mo/W) pair total electrical charge neutrality is maintained. Therefore, vacancy promoted electron-hole recombination can be avoided. Moreover, the feasibility of N doping into crystal structure of KTaO3 increases in presence of (Mo/W) due to reduction in formation energy. Interestingly, in presence of both cationic (Mo/W) and anionic dopant (N) a clean band structure is produced, which is favorable for good photoconversion efficiency. The reduction in band gap due to codoping is quite significant for enhancement of absorption of visible light, and it is more prominent in the case of (Mo, N) pair. The final conclusion has been drawn by checking the relative positions of the band edges of both the codoped systems with respect to water redox potential. Thus present study explores the role of (Mo/W, N) pair in improving the visible light photocatalytic activity of KTaO3.

Abstract: Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is the most common and aggressive interstitial lung disease, characterized by a patchy development of fibrosis leading to progressive destruction of the normal lung architecture which is preceded by an inflammatory process. Gene expression studies are important to understand the development of PF but the accuracy and reproducibility of Real-Time PCR depend on appropriate normalization strategies. This study aimed to analyze the expression variability of eight commonly used reference genes during the initial inflammatory phase of bleomycin-induced PF in a mouse model and to verify whether the selected reference genes could be applied to an in-vitro model of BLM-treated primary murine lung fibroblasts. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice (n=40) were used. Real-Time PCR was carried out on lung tissue of mice either BLM (BLM-tm) or physiological solution-treated (PSS-tm), and in primary lung fibroblasts, isolated from healthy C57BL/6 mice. Histological analysis was performed to confirm the inflammation development. During inflammation, the most stable genes resulted: PPIA, HPRT-1 and SDHA for both models; the normalization strategy was tested analyzing mRNA expression of PTX-3 and TNF-α which resulted up-regulated both in ex-vivo and in-vitro with respect to PSS-tm/fibroblasts. Histological analysis supported the results. This study identified a new set of reference genes expressed both in the in-vitro and ex-vivo models. A higher expression of both markers in BLM-tm with respect to PSS-tm indicated that BLM might lead to increased PTX-3 local production by a co-regulation with TNF-α at lung level.

Abstract: Hydrogen gas (H2) and formic acid (HCOOH) are simultaneously generated through direct water photoelectrolysis and CO2 reduction, respectively. These processes are demonstrated in this study by using photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells with working electrodes composed of InGaN/GaN epitaxial wafers in CO2-containing NaCl electrolyte. In particular, the electrolyte used in this study is the mixture of NaCl and water, which is an environment friendly aqueous solution rather than the artificial acid or alkaline solution, such as HCl or KOH. The working electrodes composed of double-sided epitaxial wafers, where Si-doped InGaN and GaN layers are separately grown on both surface sides of a sapphire substrate, exhibit higher hydrogen gas production and CO2 reduction rates than the working electrodes consisting of single-sided epitaxial layer. The typical energy conversion efficiency of HCOOH and H2 generated from the double-sided working electrodes without an external bias are estimated as 1.09% and 5.48%, respectively.

Abstract: MicroRNAs are important post transcriptional regulators of gene expression and play critical role in osteoblast differentiation. In this study we report miR-467g, an uncharacterized novel miRNA, in regulation of osteoblast functions. Over-expression of miR-467g inhibited osteoblast differentiation. Target prediction analysis tools and experimental validation by luciferase 3′ UTR reporter assay identified Runx-2 as a direct target of miR-467g. Over expression of miR-467g in osteoblasts down regulated Runx-2 and Ihh signaling components. Furthermore, silencing of miR-467g was done to see its role in Ihh and Runx-2 mediated bone healing and regeneration in a drill hole injury model in BALB/c mice. Silencing of miR-467g led to significant increase in new bone regeneration and Ihh and Runx-2 localization at injury site in a day dependent manner. In conclusion, miR-467g negatively regulates osteogenesis by targeting Ihh/Runx-2 signaling. We, thus, propose that therapeutic approaches targeting miR-467g could be useful in enhancing the new bone formation.

Abstract: To obtain cool materials as inorganic and nontoxic pigments with high near-infrared reflectance, nano-powder of Fe/N co-doped MgTiO3 (FNM), were synthesized by the sol-gel method. The substitution of Fe/N changed the color from white to dark-red due to the point defect equilibrium theory, while the band gap decreased from 2.11ev to 1.89ev. Ammonolysis reaction can promote the particle dispersion and increase the particle size. Furthermore, the FNM pigments exhibit high NIR reflectance (>65%) and the NIR solar reflectance (>53.51%) in the range of 700–2500nm. After the prepared pigments (N-doped Mg1−xFexTiO3+δ, x=0.3) and conventional brown pigments used as building roof materials, the temperature difference of coatings could reach 2.4°C (the inner surface temperature of substrate plates) and 2.0°C (the interior temperature of the two boxes), respectively. Moreover, the surface temperature distribution of the coatings was recorded by infrared images and the difference (ΔT) varied at 0–12°C. According to the maximum value of coatings (x=0.3), energy savings would reduce annual emissions of 1379.35t carbon dioxide, 41.65t nitrogen oxides and 34.30t sulfur oxides. Owing to the wide range of color and good chemical stability, which meets reflectance of solar radiation energy and cooling energy needs, these FNM materials are considered as novel color pigments.

Abstract: Copper Iodide (CuI) thin films are p-type transparent conductors. In the present investigation, the physical properties of thermally evaporated (at 300K) γ-phase copper iodide (CuI) thin films (of thickness 120nm) prepared on the quartz substrates have been reported. The grain size (from SEM measurements) is ~ 80nm. The (direct) optical band gap of CuI is 3.0eV; the films show >70% transmission in the wavelength range 550–1000nm and have low electrical resistance 72 mΩ cm. The Photo-luminescence spectra (with excitation wavelength 325nm) shows a violet emission at ~ 409.4nm (corresponds to the near band edge emission) and a shoulder peak centered at 417.4nm (indicates the trap level near to the valence band edge induced by Iodine). The Hall mobility and carrier density of holes (from room temperature Hall measurements) in CuI thin films calculated are 1.46cm2/V/s and 5.8×1019cm−3 respectively. The disorder in the CuI thin films is evaluated by the temperature dependent (20–300K) electrical resistivity measurements. The surface work-function of the CuI thin films measured by Kelvin probe technique; a non-destructive and sensitive surface analytical technique, is 4.71eV (with reference to the gold probe).

Abstract: The performance of a solar cell is inherently dependent on the illumination spectrum and intensity. Therefore standard characterization under AM1.5 illumination represents only one point in a large parameter space. In view of potential applications in portable electronics, obtaining reference data on the performance under varying light sources and illumination intensity for a comprehensive set of thin-film silicon solar cells (TFSC) is a primary motivation of our study. In addition, illumination dependencies of photovoltaic parameters provide deeper understanding of the operation and limitations of thin-film silicon solar cell for both indoor and outdoor applications. In this paper we assess the performance of single and multijunction TFSC with amorphous (a-Si:H) and microcrystalline (µc-Si:H) absorber layers under common light sources like light emitting diode (LED), halogen, fluorescent and solar simulator with AM1.5 spectrum. The illumination intensity of these light sources has been varied over several orders of magnitude (0.01–230mW/cm2) to explore a wide range of operating conditions for the solar cells. We observed expected increase in efficiency with increase of the illumination intensity (up to approximately 1 sun) of all cells and naturally strong dependence on the illumination spectrum. For example, the efficiency reached impressive 20% for a-Si:H cells under LED illumination while it is below 4% under halogen bulb. More detailed analysis performed in this work shows that the cell parameters are not always following diode model predictions mostly due to the bias-dependent collection in drift driven thin-film silicon solar cells. The results first of all provide reference for the assessment of energy gain from TFSC in various illumination conditions. It also provides better view into the limitations of TFSC and potentials for improvement especially for the non-standard illumination spectra and intensities.

Abstract: The antifungal activity of Nerol (NEL) against Candida albicans, a pathogenic fungus, has a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.4mM that causes noteworthy candidacidal activity through an apoptosis-like mechanism. Calcium (Ca2+) levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which are the major causes of apoptosis, were determined in C. albicans cells treated with NEL and were found to increase, which related to mitochondrial dysfunction and disruption. A series of characteristic changes of apoptosis caused by NEL, including mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c (cyt c) release, and metacaspase activation were examined using a flow cytometer and Western blot. The results showed that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and ROS led to dramatically decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP); cyt c was also released from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Other early apoptotic features were also observed with the metacaspase activation. Finally, the morphological changes of the cells were observed, including phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation through Annexin V-FITC and PI double staining, TUNEL assay, and DAPI staining. The results supported the hypothesis that NEL was involved in the apoptosis of C. albicans cells not only at the early stages, but also at the late stages. In summary, NEL can trigger mitochondrial dysfunction and disruption via elevation of Ca2+ and ROS leading to apoptosis in C. albicans. This research on the mechanism of cell death triggered by NEL against C. albicans has important significance for providing a novel treatment of C. albicans infections.

Abstract: In this study, dodecylbenzene sulfonate acid (DBSA) doped-polyaniline (PANI) films were synthesized in situ on Au/porous flexible substrate by electrochemical deposition. The emissivity change (△ε) data of PANI films show a reversal from positive to negative as the polymerization charge increases. This trend can be explained by using the Drude free electron theory and the Hagen-Rubens approximation at low frequency due to the pseudo-metallic behavior of conducting polymers. The DBSA doped-PANI film was used as an active layer to fabricate an infrared (IR) electrochromic device. The △ε of this IR electrochromic device was measured to be 0.183, 0.388, and 0.315 in the wavelength ranges of 3–5µm, 8–12µm, and 2.5–25µm, respectively. IR thermal images visually obtained from an IR thermal imager suggest that the IR electrochromic device possesses regulating capacity of thermal radiation within the operating waveband of the instrument (7.5–14µm). The IR electrochromic device developed in this work can be potentially used in IR camouflage for military and thermal control for satellite.

Abstract: The small wavelength utilizable range used for determining the optimum performance of photovoltaic and rectenna devices, compared to the broad band spectrum of solar or other heat sources, limits the energy conversion efficiency of such technologies. A selective emitter, with an emissivity profile that matches the receiver's characteristic bandwidth, can be used to improve the overall efficiency of such energy harvesting devices. This paper compares simulated and experimental results of the design and fabrication of a selective emitter that can be used in the 8–12µm frequency range. The matrix transform method is used to calculate the radiative properties of one dimensional metal-dielectric photonic structures. By using genetic algorithm as a powerful optimization tool, the simulated design characteristics of such structure are adjusted to minimize the mean square deviation of the actual spectral emissivity from the target emissivity profile. Specifically, this paper presents and compares results of the simulated design and fabrication of selective emitters composed of alternating layers of Al2O3-SiO2 or Al2O3-SiC on an aluminum substrate. The output radiation of these selective emitters could be used as the input radiation to high efficiency rectenna devices.

Abstract: Solar spectral behavior of nanopigments has been an important issue in many practical relevance due to their tunable properties. There are extensive literatures on radiative transfer through pigmented coating but they are generally restricted to a small range of materials with specific properties and particular applications. Current study, on the other hand, concerns with a comprehensive look at contribution of fundamental characteristics of nanopigments on spectral behavior of the pigmented coatings. In order to accomplish this goal, a Discrete Ordinate Method (DOM), known as Multi Flux (MF) model in color science, has been applied on spherical particles embedded in nonabsorbing medium, and their optical responses including reflectance, transmittance and absorption has been studied over solar spectrum, with special emphasis on VIS region. The effect of various indices of refraction, particle sizes and volume fractions has been further investigated. Obtained results reveal that, pigments with different fundamental and morphological structures represent interesting optical behavior which is very promising in optimization of spectrally selective pigmented coatings. The results from MF model were subsequently validated using spectrophotometric measurements on Titanium dioxide nanopigments coated on white polyester substrate, which represented a good agreement with collected data from MF model.

Abstract: The band alignment at the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4/CdS solar cell heterojunction is a controversial issue, as different measurements and calculations point to substantially different conduction band offsets (CBO). As the actual value of the CBO has profound implications on solar cell performance, the aim of this work is to separate genuine process-dependent variations in the CBO from errors in its experimental determination. We argue that the two most likely mechanisms responsible for real CBO variations are Fermi level pinning (which tends to decrease the CBO) and chemical interdiffusion (which tends to increase the CBO). The experimental and computational approaches employed so far to determine the band alignment are analyzed to point out possible limitations for each approach, with an emphasis on photoemission-based approaches. The influence of Fermi level pinning on the CBO should be captured correctly by all types of measurements, except for measurements performed under flat-band conditions. This may explain some particularly large values of the CBO that have been measured under flat-band conditions. On the other hand, the influence of interdiffusion is difficult to resolve completely by most measurement approaches. Interestingly, a rough correlation can be established between the CBO measured at the Cu2ZnSnS4/CdS interface by different groups and their corresponding solar cell efficiency: lower-efficiency cells often have a large “cliff-like” offset, whereas most high-efficiency cells have a “spike-like” or nearly flat offset. Control of interdiffusion can be a powerful way to engineer the optimal band alignment in Cu2ZnSnS4/CdS solar cells, but it can be detrimental in Cu2ZnSnSe4/CdS solar cells, as it may increase the CBO above the optimal range for maximum efficiency.

Abstract: Passivated contacts based on low-pressure chemical vapor deposited (LPCVD) heavily-doped poly-Si and a thin SiOx layer are explored for the application in an interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cell. The poly-Si/SiOx contacts are realized by applying wet-chemically grown SiOx tunnel layers and amorphous Si (a-Si) layers doped via ion implantation that are subsequently transformed into poly-Si/SiOx contacts by a high temperature step. The impact of doping species, ion dose, and poly-Si thickness on the surface passivation of such contacts is studied. Excellent J0 values down to 4.5fA/cm2 were measured for n+-poly-Si contacts, while J0 values as low as 22fA/cm2 were obtained for p+-poly-Si contacts. Solar cells with top/rear poly-Si contacts were processed and Voc values up to 709mV and FF values above 81% were measured. Furthermore, the upper bound for the parasitic absorption losses in 10–40nm thick poly-Si films was quantified to be about 0.5mA/cm2 per 10nm poly-Si layer thickness.

Abstract: Atmospheric pressure air plasma treatment was applied to glass substrates to improve the adhesion of the reflective silver layer of mirrors used in solar power systems. This treatment attempts to prevent problems related to the detachment of this layer that affect its energy performance. Untreated and plasma treated glass substrates were subjected to a spray coating process to fabricate mirrors. Chemical characterization by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and measurements of the water contact angle (WCA) were undertaken on the glass substrates before the plating process. The reflectivity of the mirrors was studied by spectrophotometry in the wavelength range of 280–2500nm, and the adhesion between the glass substrates and the silver layers was measured by pull-off tests. In order to determine the relationship between the parameters of the plasma treatment and the adhesion and reflectivity of the mirrors, different combinations of treatment speeds and gap distances between the glass substrates and the plasma nozzle were used. It was observed that the plasma treatment has a cleaning effect and forms oxygen-based functional groups that promote the hydrophilicity of the glass substrates. This double effect resulted in improved adhesion of the silver layer to the plasma treated substrates, with no significant loss of solar reflectance of the mirrors. The plasma treatment with the lowest gap distance (2mm) and the lowest speed (1m/min) achieved the best results in this work. It brought an improvement of 85.8% in the breaking strength of the untreated glass mirror and no significant variation in the solar reflectance in as-fabricated conditions. After accelerated aging, it maintained an improvement of 27.2% in the breaking strength and showed higher solar reflectance than the untreated glass mirror.

Abstract: Interfacial engineering related to charge transfer plays a vital role in boosting performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). For the first time, we report Al2O3 layer passivated TiO2 nanorods (NRs) array as an electron transfer layer (ETL) for thermal evaporation-route synthesized formamidine lead iodine (FAPbI3) PSCs. The modification of Al2O3 layer on TiO2 NRs can efficiently enhance charge transport and retard charge recombination at interface between ETL and FAPbI3 layers. PSCs based on evaporation-fabricated FAPbI3 absorption layer and Al2O3-TiO2 ETL display excellent photoelectronic performance, showing a high photoelectric conversion efficiency of 14% with negligible hysteresis and excellent reproducibility and stability. Al2O3 passivation can induce an obvious fluorescence quenching phenomenon and reduced electron-hole recombination rate. The greatly improved performances can be attributed to the following three factors. Firstly, Al2O3 buffer layer as a barrier can effectively retard electrons in ETL reversely transport and impede charge carrier recombination. Secondly, Al2O3 passivation can enhance the TiO2/FAPbI3 interface contacts, alleviate the electron trapping effect resulted from the surface defects at TiO2/perovskite interface, benefiting for electron extraction to be transported directly toward FTO. Thirdly, the evaporation synthetic route is helpful to get extremely homogeneous FAPbI3 film without any pinholes and compact interface.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have attracted enormous attention due to their low cost and high power conversion efficiency. However, the use of toxic metals such as lead in the perovskite dye and the disposal methods of perovskite solar cells cause grave concerns about their environmental impacts. Inorganic and lead-free perovskite solar cells have been developed to overcome the disadvantages of lead-based organic perovskite solar cells, a development that involves different materials and manufacturing processes to fabricate different perovskite solar cells. In order to understand and develop an environmentally friendly perovskite solar cell technology, comprehensive environmental impact assessments have been conducted in this study on five typical perovskite solar cells, using an attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The results indicate that MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells have relatively larger environmental impacts than MASnI3−xBrx, CsPbBr3, and MAPbI2Cl perovskite solar cells based on a 1cm2 active area solar cell system, and this result can be explained by the different amounts of organic solvents used in the device fabrication. In addition, gold production makes the largest environmental impact contribution to perovskite solar cell systems, and the substitution of silver or aluminum for gold can significantly reduce the total environmental impact scores. For disposal methods, incineration with energy recovery is found better than landfill.

Abstract: Centrosomal proteins have been implicated in the progression of human diseases. CEP131 plays important roles in centrosome duplication and genome stability, but its role in cancers remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that CEP131 expression was increased in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), compared to the paracarcinoma tissues, at both mRNA and protein levels. High CEP131 expression was closely associated with tumor size (P=0.020), tumor capsule (P=0.043), TNM stage (P=0.007) and tumor differentiation (P=0.019). Furthermore, patients with high expression of CEP131 were accompanied with worse overall and disease-free survivals in our and TCGA cohorts consisting of a total of 802 cases. The prognostic value of CEP131 was further confirmed by stratified survival analysis. Multivariate cox regression model indicated that CEP131 was an independent factor for overall survival (hazard ratio=1.762, 95% confident interval: 1.443–2.151, P<0.001). In vitro data demonstrated that nucleophosmin (NPM) physically bound to CEP131 and maintained its protein stability. Overexpression of CEP131 in HCC cell lines enhanced cell proliferation and migration, whereas the knockdown of CEP131 led to the opposite phenotypes. Further studies demonstrated that CEP131 exhibited oncogenic activity via activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest CEP131 serves as a potential prognostic biomarker in HCC, and functions as an oncogene in this deadly disease.

Abstract: Mitochondrial introns in flowering plant genes are virtually all classified as members of the group II ribozyme family although certain structural features have degenerated to varying degrees over evolutionary time. We are interested in the impact that unconventional intron architecture might have on splicing biochemistry in vivo and we have focused in particular on intronic domains V and VI, which for self-splicing introns provide a key component of the catalytic core and the bulged branchpoint adenosine, respectively. Notably, the two transesterification steps in classical group II splicing are the same as for nuclear spliceosomal introns and release the intron as a lariat. Using RT-PCR and circularized RT-PCR, we had previously demonstrated that several wheat mitochondrial introns which lack a branchpoint adenosine have atypical splicing pathways, and we have now extended this analysis to the full set of wheat introns, namely six trans-splicing and sixteen cis-splicing ones. A number of introns are excised using non-lariat pathways and interestingly, we find that several introns which do have a conventional domain VI also use pathways that appear to exploit other internal or external nucleophiles, with the lariat form being relatively minor. Somewhat surprisingly, several introns with weakly-structured domain V/VI helices still exhibit classical lariat splicing, suggesting that accessory factors aid in restoring a splicing-competent conformation. Our observations illustrate that the loss of conventional group II features during evolution is correlated with altered splicing biochemistry in an intron-distinctive manner.

Abstract: Carrier-selective contact schemes, like polysilicon on oxide (POLO), provide low contact resistivities while preserving an excellent passivation quality. These junctions offer an important additional feature compared to a-Si/c-Si heterojunctions. We find that the formation of n-type POLO junctions lead to a huge increase of the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) lifetime of the substrate, a prerequisite for highly efficient solar cells. The SRH lifetime improvement can be observed for both bulk polarities and for a variety of bulk resistivities. Thus we suggest that the highly doped POLO junction getters impurities that have more or less symmetric SRH capture cross sections. We are able to achieve SRH lifetimes of > 50ms. By applying POLO junctions to interdigitated back contact cells, we achieve cells with an efficiency of 25%.

Abstract: It has been shown that the sympathetic nervous system is activated in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Norepinephrine (NE) levels are increased by chemoreflex-dependent sympathetic overactivation and involved in pulmonary vascular remodeling. However, the underlying mechanisms of the remodeling induced by NE are poorly understood. In this study, we found that, in vivo, the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and the concentration of plasma NE were increased in PAH rats compared with normal rats. Increases in ventricular hypertrophy and medial width of the pulmonary arteries were reversed by prazosin, α1-adrenoceptor (α1-AR) antagonists, in PAH rats. Elevated expression of α1D-AR was detected in PAH rats. In addition, prazosin reduced the increasing expression of PCNA, CyclinA and CyclinE induced by hypoxia. In vitro, MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the effects of NE on proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). We revealed that NE promoted PASMCs viability, increased the expression of PCNA, CyclinA and CyclinE, made more cells from G0/G1 phase to G2/M+S phase and enhanced the microtubule formation. Above NE-induced changes could be suppressed by BMY 7378, an inhibitor of α1D-AR. Furthermore, ERK-1/2 pathway was activated by NE. U0126, a specific inhibitor for ERK-1/2, attenuated the NE-induced proliferation of PASMCs under normoxia and hypoxia. Taken together, our results suggest that NE which stimulates α1D-AR promotes proliferation of PASMCs and the effect is, at least in part, mediated via the ERK-1/2 pathway.

Abstract: The photo-degradation of polymer solar cells is a critical challenge preventing its commercial deployment. We experimentally fabricate organic solar cells and characterize their degradation under solar simulators in an environmental chamber under nitrogen flow, without exposure to oxygen and moisture. We have developed a thermally stable inverted organic solar cell architecture in which light induced degradation of device characteristics can be reversibly annealed to the pristine values. The stable inverted cells utilized MoOx layers that are thermally treated immediately after their deposition on the organic layer, and before metal cathode deposition. Organic solar cells that are photo-degraded in the presence of oxygen, however show irreversible degradation that cannot be thermally recovered. The decrease of organic solar cell characteristics correlates with increases in mid-gap electronic states, measured using capacitance spectroscopy and dark current. It is likely the photo-induced defect states caused by local H motion from the alkyl chains to the aromatic backbone, can be reversibly annealed at elevated temperatures after photo-degradation. Our results provide a pathway for improving the stability of organic photovoltaics.

Abstract: We present a modeling framework to quantify current density losses and determine optimization steps for four-terminal tandem solar cells, which consist of a high-bandgap thin-film top cell and an industrial-type Si wafer bottom cell. We demonstrate the framework on the example of a 21.3% efficient stacked four-terminal GaAs/Si tandem solar cell. In a first step, we develop an optical model for stacked tandem configuration and carry out the current loss analysis for this tandem device. Photon absorption in the tandem is broken down into different channels. All parasitic absorptions that do not contribute to current generation are considered part of a loss channel. In a second step, we quantify the potential current gains from single-parameter optimizations, the redistribution of photon losses into other channels, and the synergistic gains that can be achieved by co-optimization. Finally, using the simulation model, we are able to determine the best sequence of optimizing the short-circuit current density in the GaAs/Si tandem solar cell to possibly achieve 37.8mA/cm2 with experimentally feasible parameters.

Abstract: To achieve fully utilization of solar energy, development of an efficient full solar spectrum light responsive photocatalyst is strongly needed. Besides, the smaller particle sizes, better dispersion and more heterojunction interfaces can enhance the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts. Assembling graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a narrow bandgap semiconductor to form a heterostructure which can increase the charge-separation efficiency and harvest the light from UV to near-infrared (NIR) region would be ideal for photocatalysis. Here, we report a facile synthesis of Ag2O/g-C3N4 heterostructures by in-situ growth Ag2O nanoparticles (NPs) onto surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets (NSs) to display superior UV–visible-NIR full spectrum photocatalytic activities and favorable stability. TEM results show that the obtained Ag2O NPs with the size of 8nm are uniformly dispersed on the surface of g-C3N4 NSs, which reveals that g-C3N4 is probably a promising support template for in-situ growth of nano-sized materials. The mechanism for improving the photocatalytic performance of the Ag2O/g-C3N4 heterostructures is proposed. It is demonstrated that the Ag2O/g-C3N4 heterostructures not only enhance the production of photogenerated electron-hole pairs by extending the visible and NIR light absorption region due to the visible and NIR harvesting of highly dispersed smaller Ag2O NPs on the surface of g-C3N4 NSs, but also facilitate electron-hole separation by the heterojunction formed by intimate contact between Ag2O and g-C3N4. Moreover, the formation of a certain amount of metal Ag0 on the surface of Ag2O under illumination contribute to the high stability and charge transfer of Ag2O/g-C3N4 heterostructures.

Abstract: Materials with excellent photochromic (PC) characteristics are promising to be applied in energy-saving smart windows, however little progress was achieved in the past decade. Herein we propose a heterojunction strategy based on a MoO3@TiO2 (MT) core/shell nanorods system to obtain remarkably enhanced photochromic property. MT core/shell nanorods have a crystalline MoO3 core with a chemically bonded amorphous TiO2 shell. They were synthesized by a scalable water-bath method and characterized by using x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry. The MT photochromic response extends from the visible to the infrared and depends on the transmittance of the MT core/shell nanorods. The photochromic optical modulation of MT core/shell nanorods is faster and more efficient than that of MoO3 nanorods, derived from remarkable structural and chemical changes, as revealed by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. XPS analysis combined with EELS probing on a single rod indicates that the photochromic-enhancement mechanism is highly correlated to the charge transfer between Ti and Mo species, especially across the MoO3/TiO2 interface. Oxidation of Ti3+occurs simultaneously with the PC reductive transition of the Mo center, which indicates that Ti3+ plays an important role either as electron source or by favoring electron transfer by charge rectification through hole scavenging. The significant role of Ti3+ is further confirmed by annealing the material in air, which quenches the Ti3+ defects and thereby reduces PC enhancement to negligible levels compared with the unannealed samples. By controlling the shell defect state rather than only considering the bulk band structure, this work provides a new paradigm for modulating photo-driven charge transfer across core/shell heterojunctions.

Abstract: Thin-film solar cells based on Cu(In, Ga)Se2 chalcopyrite materials have achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCE) above 22%, higher than any other thin film technology. Here, a proof-of-principle for Cu(In, Ga)Se2 solar cells with a reduced materials consumption by a factor of ~100 is demonstrated for which simulations indicate an even higher PCE potential. The concept is based on using micrometer-sized solar cells onto which sunlight is concentrated using a lens array. Thereby, all incoming sunlight is absorbed in solar cells that only cover a fraction (on the order of 1/100) of the surface, creating thus significant material savings. A fabrication process based on selective growth of CuInSe2 micro solar cells is presented, using electrodeposition into holes of an insulating SiO2 layer on a Mo back electrical contact. Proof-of-principle micro solar cells using this materials-savings approach are realized and characterized. Additionally, the heat management of micro-concentrator solar cells is studied using finite element simulations. For square micro solar cells up to 100µm side length the temperature increase due to the concentrated sunlight can be kept below 4°C above that of a flat panel solar cell. An increase of the PCE by 4.9% is estimated, considering the combined effect of the open circuit voltage increase due to concentrated sunlight, and the PCE decrease due to the temperature increase.

Abstract: This work demonstrates the preparation of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1-x)4(CZTSSe) thin films by sputtering deposition using single-phase Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) target followed by selenization/sulfurization treatment at 570°C for 1h. Afterward, the CZTSSe thin-film solar cell samples with the Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/IZO/Al structure were prepared and their performances were evaluated. By varying the ratio of Se and S powders of heat treatment, the Cu-poor/Zn-rich CZTSSe layers with S/(S+Se) ratio in the range of 0.21–1 were achieved and the CZTSSe layers were the mixture of kesterite CZTS and CZTSe phases as revealed by the x-ray diffraction and the Raman spectroscopy analyses. UV-NIR spectroscopy indicated the bandgaps of CZTSSe samples are in the range of 1.06–1.45eV when the S/(S+Se) ratio varies from 0.21 to 1. Hall measurement observed the best transport property with p-type carrier concentration of 2.17×1015cm−3 and mobility of 8.9cm2V−1sec−1 in CZTSSe layer with S/(S+Se) ratio of 0.46. Under the AM1.5 illumination condition, the CZTSSe thin-film solar cell sample with S/(S+Se) ratio of 0.46 exhibited the best performance with open-circuit voltage of 0.506V, short-circuit current density of 27.41mA/cm2, fill factor of 50% and conversion efficiency of 6.9%.

Abstract: Application of a thin-film SiOx barrier layer prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) enables to achieve, with a Cu-plated amorphous Si/crystalline Si heterojunction (HJ c-Si) solar cell, a retention ratio of over 99% for the maximum power after 6000-h 85°C/85% relative humidity mini-module damp heat (DH) test. A series of DH tests revealed that there existed two crucial factors to maintain long-term photovoltaic properties; protection from moisture ingress from outside of the module and suppression of sodium ions (Na+) diffusion from the module front cover-glass. Surface capping of a HJ c-Si solar cell by a PECVD-SiOx layer reduces the ingress of both moisture and Na+ into the layers below the PECVD-SiOx, leading to an improvement of the reliability after DH test. Besides, the PECVD-SiOx layer plays a role as a barrier layer protecting the heterojunction during the Cu electroplating process. Using a PECVD-SiOx layer, we have developed an industrial metallization scheme for Cu-plated HJ c-Si solar cells. This industrially compatible metallization scheme is effective to increase module conversion efficiency and reduce the metallization cost. Therefore, use of the PECVD-SiOx layer allows the optimization of the HJ c-Si solar cell and contributes to the improvement of the photovoltaic power generation and the reduction of the module production cost.

Abstract: Flexible perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) possessing high efficiency and low fabrication cost have been considered as the promising wearable energy supply devices in the near future. However, the intrinsic brittleness of the commonly used transparent conducting oxide electrodes is one of the limitations for the mechanical stability of flexible pero-SCs. Here we demonstrate the improved mechanical stability of flexible pero-SCs consisting of ultrathin Au electrode and vapour-deposited perovskite film. The thermal annealing-free perovskite film fabrication by vapour deposition is beneficial to the stability of the ultrathin Au electrode and contributes to the improved mechanical stability of the flexible pero-SCs. The power conversion efficiency for flexible pero-SCs maintains 74% of their initial efficiencies after 2000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 3.5mm.

Abstract: Abstract:
Besides their application in photovoltaics, semiconductor solar-energy-materials can be directly employed as photocatalysts of hydrogen fuel production using sunlight and water feedstock. In this paper, through a facile hydrothermal route, we synthesized a CuO-ZnO pn junction nanocomposite in the absence and presence of carbon nanotube (CNT), and applied them in a water photosplitting setup to evolve hydrogen gas. The investigation revealed that in the presence of CNT, the photocatalyst performance increases significantly–becomes approximately twice. The superior activity witnessed here for the ternary nanocomposite (CuO-ZnO/CNT) was explained in terms of the ability of CNT to enlarge the photocatalyst surface area, enhance the absorption of photons, and prohibit the recombination of photogenerated e/h pairs. Finally, quantum yield and energy efficiency analyses were performed on both binary and ternary nanocomposite materials as well as on their semiconductor components, and the results were discussed in detail from physicochemical viewpoint.

Abstract: Single-cell sequencing has emerged as a revolutionary method that reveals biological processes with unprecedented resolution and scale, and has already greatly impacted biology and medicine. To investigate processes such as alternative splicing, novel exon detection and allele-specific expression (ASE), full-length based single-cell RNA-seq methods are required for broad sequence coverage and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification. In this review, we revisit recent achievements from studies that used single-cell RNA-seq to advance our understanding of ASE in the context of both autosomal and X-chromosome genes. We also recapitulate useful bioinformatic tools developed to identify haplotype phase.

Abstract: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays crucial roles in the development, maintenance, plasticity and homeostasis of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Perturbing BDNF signaling in mouse brain results in hyperphagia, obesity, hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. Currently, little is known whether BDNF affects liver tissue directly. Our aim was to determine the metabolic signaling pathways activated after BDNF treatment in hepatocytes. Unlike its effect in the brain, BDNF did not lead to activation of the liver AKT pathway. However, AMP protein activated kinase (AMPK) was ∼3 times more active and fatty acid synthase (FAS) ∼2-fold less active, suggesting increased fatty acid oxidation and reduced fatty acid synthesis. In addition, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) was ∼3.5-fold less active together with its output the gluconeogenic transcript phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck), suggesting reduced gluconeogenesis. The levels of glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b) was ∼3-fold higher suggesting increased glycogen synthesis. In parallel, the expression levels of the clock genes Bmal1 and Cry1, whose protein products play also a metabolic role, were ∼2-fold increased and decreased, respectively. In conclusion, BDNF binding to hepatocytes leads to activation of catabolic pathways, such as fatty acid oxidation. In parallel gluconeogenesis is inhibited, while glycogen storage is triggered. This metabolic state mimics that of after breakfast, in which the liver continues to oxidize fat, stops gluconeogenesis and replenishes glycogen stores.

Abstract: The glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anchored urokinase receptor (uPAR) has no intracellular domain, but nevertheless initiates signalling through proximal interactions with other membrane receptors including integrins. The relationships between uPAR and ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins, moesin and merlin have never been explored. Moesin and merlin are versatile membrane-actin links and regulators of receptors signalling, respectively. We show that uPAR controls moesin and merlin, which propagate uPAR-initiated signals and modulate integrin functions, thereby regulating uPAR activity. uPAR rapidly de-phosphorylates moesin and phosphorylates merlin inactivating both proteins, and enhancing cell migration and angiogenesis. Moesin behaves as a molecular switch turning either on or off uPAR signalling through cycles of de-activation/activation, or sustained activation, respectively. Furthermore, moesin is at the crossroads of uPAR-initiated outside-in and inside-out signalling promoting integrin-dependent cell adhesion suggesting that uPAR also activates integrins distally through moesin. Knocking down merlin expression enhanced cell migration and adhesion through different regulation of fibronectin- and vitronectin-binding integrins.

Abstract: One passive cooling approach is pumping energy to outer space through thermal radiation. Such a radiative cooling mechanism widely exists in nature and is important to maintain the temperature of the earth. However, natural materials generally have poor radiative cooling efficiency. To better utilize the radiative cooling for thermal management applications, the surface should be designed to have a high reflectivity in the solar spectrum and high emissivity in the "sky window" region (8–13µm in wavelength). In this work, we propose and demonstrate a highly scalable nanoparticle-based double-layer coating to achieve such selective radiative properties. Double-layer coatings consisting of a top reflective layer with high solar albedo and a bottom emissive layer are achieved by properly designed TiO2, SiO2, and SiC nanoparticles. These coatings were fabricated on both low- and high-emissivity substrates and their spectral radiative properties were characterized. The coating composed of TiO2 and SiO2 on a reflective substrate has excellent selective emission property for radiative cooling purpose. Under dry air conditions and assuming non-radiative heat transfer coefficient hc=4W/m2K, TiO2+SiO2 and TiO2+SiC can theoretically achieve about 17°C below ambient at night and 5°C below ambient under direct solar radiation (AM1.5). On-site measurements have also been conducted. Under direct solar irradiation, significant temperature reduction was observed for both aluminum and black substrate after the coating was applied. At nighttime, radiative cooling effect can cool the surface to a few degrees below ambient temperature. Although the theoretical cooling under dry weather condition is not observed, the experiment results can be well explained by theoretical calculations with the consideration of high humidity and non-radiative heat transfer. This nanoparticle-based approach can be easily applied to large area, which is a significant step of achieving large scale application of the radiative cooling technology.

Abstract: A new spectrally selective solar absorber coating of TiC-WC/Al2O3 tandem layer is designed and prepared on stainless steel (SS) substrate by magnetron sputtering. The coating consists of an absorptance layer (TiC-WC) and an antireflectance layer (Al2O3) from substrate to top. The new SS/TiC-WC/Al2O3 coating exhibits excellent selective absorbing properties with a high solar absorptance of 0.92 and a low thermal emittance of 0.11. The SS/TiC-WC/Al2O3 coating presents a purple color, which is further investigated by chromaticity study. The thermal stability of the coating is evaluated and characterized by SEM, XRD, UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Experimental results indicate that the coating is highly stable in vacuum at 500°C for 100h with a good solar selectivity of 0.92/0.11.

Abstract: Solution-processed colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for large-scale, low-cost, and lightweight photovoltaic and electronic devices. Carrier transport dynamics has a substantial impact on device efficiency optimization. Coupled with photocarrier radiometry (PCR) — a dynamic spectrally integrated frequency-domain photoluminescence (PL) modality, we report the derivation of a trap-state-mediated carrier hopping transport model for the extraction of multiple carrier transport parameters in PbS CQD thin films. These parameters, including effective carrier lifetime τE, hopping diffusivity Dh, trap-state-dependent carrier trapping rate RT, diffusion length Lh, and carrier thermal emission rate ei, were obtained for CQD thin films with different dot size and capping ligands: tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT), and methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite (MAPbI3). Consistent with the framework of phonon-assisted carrier hopping mechanism, τE, Dh, and Lh have demonstrated a monotonic dependence on temperature in the range from 100 K to 300 K. Perovskite-passivated PbS CQD thin films, especially those with larger dot sizes which are free of apparent defect induced PL emission and have higher τE and Dh at room temperature (ca. 0.51μs and 1.80×10−2cm2/s, respectively) than their counterparts, demonstrate better photovoltaic material properties. Dot-size-dependent exciton binding energies (35.21–53.20meV) were characterized using a dynamic PCR photo-thermal spectroscopy that also characterized the trap-state-mediated carrier hopping activation energies in the range from 100meV to 280meV. To test the reliability of the best-fitted results, computational fitting uniqueness was examined using a parametric theory.

Abstract: The ever increasing demand of energy consumption, and harmful CO2 emission, which causes global warming necessitate the urgent need of energy conservation particularly in buildings which are one of the energy consuming sectors. The most vulnerable building parts to heat gain and heat loss are windows that count for substantial cooling and heating load consequently. An enormous amount of electrical energy is being consumed to run air conditioner devices to adjust the temperature of living spaces and inside buildings, while proper glazing technologies and materials can be utilized to reduce the energy consumption. With the advancement of glazing technology, smart, passive, and active windows are developed that can considerably decrease buildings energy demands while improving indoor environment. This paper rigorously reviews various types of glass coatings and glazing systems including conventional, advanced, and smart and highlights their paramount features. The relative merits of various coatings fabrication methods are elucidated. Finally based on touchstone for different climate types, the possibility of employing different window technologies is discussed for hot, cool, and temperate climates.

Abstract: A key step in industrialization of photovoltaics (PV) is the development of low-cost and large-area metallization processes to substitute the standard screen-printing process of silver paste. Thus Cu and Ni metallization processes enabled by laser patterning have been widely pursued in passivated-emitter rear-cell (PERC) technology. However, the undesirable opto-thermal side-effects of laser processing have so far hindered using similar processes for metallization of Si heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells due to the relatively high sensitivity of SHJ cells to thermal shocks. Here an innovative process is described, in which the laser damage to the SHJ cell is minimized by using a double-mask layer that optically and thermally isolates the device from the laser beam. As a proof of concept, Si heterojunction solar cells of 235cm2 surface area are metallized using this method and >19% power conversion efficiencies are achieved. This process is applicable to any temperature-sensitive electronic device with front conductive surface, such as perovskite/Si multi-junction and semi-transparent perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: The power conversion efficiency of TiO2 based organo-lead halide perovskite solar cells has already surpassed 20% by utilizing low temperature solution processing techniques. However, the electronic structures and exciton/electron transport mechanism at the TiO2/perovskite interface are not fully understood. In this report, simple planar TiO2/perovskite heterojunctions are fabricated with different TiO2 compact layers followed by studies of their effect on the charge extraction/transport properties of the deposited heterojunctions. Efficient perovskite solar cells based on these TiO2/perovskite heterojunctions [with CH3NH3PbI3 and FA0.81MA0.15Pb(I0.836Br0.15)3 films] have been fabricated and the devices exhibit reproducible efficiency values and good stability. The impact of interfacial potential barrier and TiO2 surface properties on photogenerated carrier transport mechanisms and overall power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells is investigated by using comprehensive electrical and optical characterization methods such as SEM, XRD, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, TRPL, TAS and TPD. Obtained results indicate that efficient device can be fabricated by optimizing of TiO2 annealing conditions.

Abstract: The quality and cost of a wafer are important prerequisites for a high-efficiency, low-cost solar cell. Standard wafers are fabricated using a dicing process, which leads to the loss of a substantial amount of material (up to 40%), the kerf loss. The kerf loss is costly, but in standard technologies, it is unavoidable. As the wafer thickness decreases, these losses become more significant. Using an alternative approach, by applying a sacrificial detachment layer on top of a thin seed layer made of porous silicon for a follow-on thick epitaxial growth, so-called EpiWafers can be produced, and kerf losses can be avoided. An advantage of this EpiWafer production process is that the thickness of the wafers can be deliberately chosen according to requirements, e.g. between 50µm and 250µm. The wafer production costs are lower than standard wafering techniques if high-throughput porosification tools and chemical vapour deposition reactors are used. In this work, solar cells with n-type wafers epitaxially grown in an atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition reactor are presented. The processed wafers feature an n-type doping density of 3×1016cm−3 and a mean thickness of 150µm. The best EpiWafer cell reached an open circuit voltage of 657mV, a short circuit current of 39.6mA/cm2 and a fill factor of 77%. A detailed analysis of the losses caused by stacking faults and cell process issues is presented. The resulting energy conversion efficiency of 20% proves the high efficiency potential of this material.

Abstract: Both buried contact solar cells (BCSC) and laser doped selective emitter (LDSE) solar cells have achieved considerable success in large-scale manufacturing. Both technologies are based on plated contacts. High metal aspect ratios achieved by BCSC allow low shading loss while the buried metal contacts in the grooves provide good contact adhesion strength. In comparison, although the LDSE cell achieves significantly higher efficiencies and is a much simpler approach for forming the selective emitter region and self-aligned metal plating, the metal adhesion strength falls well short of that achieved by the BCSC. Recent studies show that plated contacts based on the latter can be more durable than screen-printed contacts. This work introduces a new concept of laser doping with grooving to form narrow grooves with heavily doped walls in a simultaneous step, with the self-aligned metal contact subsequently formed by plating. This process capitalizes on the benefits of both BCSC and LDSE cells. The laser-doped grooves are only 3–5µm wide and 10–15µm deep; the very steep walls of these grooves remain exposed even after the subsequent deposition of the antireflection coating (ARC). This unique feature significantly reduces the formation of laser-induced defects since the stress due to the thermal expansion mismatch between the ARC and silicon is avoided. Furthermore, the exposed walls allow nucleation of the subsequent metal plating. This novel structure also benefits from greatly enhanced adhesion of the plated contact due to it being buried underneath the silicon surface in the same way as the BCSC. Cell efficiencies over 19% are achieved by using this technology on p-type Czochralski (Cz) wafers with a full area aluminum (Al) back surface field (BSF) rear contact. It is expected that much higher voltages and consequently higher efficiencies could be achieved if this technology is combined with a passivated rear approach.

Abstract: Cancer cell metabolism is largely controlled by oncogenic signals and nutrient availability. Here, we highlighted that the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), an intracellular protein influencing many signaling pathways, reprograms cancer cell metabolism to promote proliferation. We provided evidence that GILZ overexpression induced a significant increase of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as evidenced by the augmentation in basal respiration, ATP-linked respiration as well as respiratory capacity. Pharmacological inhibition of glucose, glutamine and fatty acid oxidation reduced the activation of GILZ-induced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. At glycolysis level, GILZ-overexpressing cells enhanced the expression of glucose transporters in their plasmatic membrane and showed higher glycolytic reserve. 1H NMR metabolites quantification showed an up-regulation of amino acid biosynthesis. The GILZ-induced metabolic reprograming is present in various cancer cell lines regardless of their driver mutations status and is associated with higher proliferation rates persisting under metabolic stress conditions. Interestingly, high levels of OXPHOS made GILZ-overexpressing cells vulnerable to cell death induced by mitochondrial pro-oxidants. Altogether, these data indicate that GILZ reprograms cancer metabolism towards mitochondrial OXPHOS and sensitizes cancer cells to mitochondria-targeted drugs with pro-oxidant activities.

Abstract: Stem cells have been assumed to demonstrate a reliance on anaerobic energy generation, suited to their hypoxic in vivo environment. However, we found that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have an active oxidative metabolism with a range of substrates. More ATP was consistently produced from substrate oxidation than glycolysis by cultured hMSCs. Strong substrate preferences were shown with the ketone body, acetoacetate, being oxidised at up to 35 times the rate of glucose. ROS-generation was 45-fold lower during acetoacetate oxidation compared with glucose and substrate preference may be an adaptation to reduce oxidative stress. The UCP2 inhibitor, genipin, increased ROS production with either acetoacetate or glucose by 2-fold, indicating a role for UCP2 in suppressing ROS production. Addition of pyruvate stimulated acetoacetate oxidation and this combination increased ATP production 27-fold, compared with glucose alone, which has implications for growth medium composition. Oxygen tension during culture affected metabolism by hMSCs. Between passages 2 and 5, rates of both glycolysis and substrate-oxidation increased at least 2-fold for normoxic (20% O2)- but not hypoxic (5% O2)-cultured hMSCs, despite declining growth rates and no detectable signs of differentiation. Culture of the cells with 3-hydroxybutyrate abolished the increased rates of these pathways. These findings have implications for stem cell therapy, which necessarily involves in vitro culture of cells, since low passage number normoxic cultured stem cells show metabolic adaptations without detectable changes in stem-like status.

Abstract: This study presents the re-fabrication of a crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell using a Si wafer reclaimed from the solar cell of an end-of-life (EoL) module, and an evaluation of its performance. A 6-in. commercial solar cell was used in the etching process by wet chemical process in order to investigate the optimal mixing ratio of a mixture of HNO3 and HF. The silicon nitride (SiNx) and aluminum (Al) back contact on both sides of the solar cell were not completely removed at a high ratio of aqueous HNO3, and the precipitation of Ag particles on the surface of Si wafer were deposited at a high ratio of aqueous HF in a mixed acid solution. The optimum etching condition for the recovery of the c-Si wafer was applied to the EoL module, which consisted of 4″ solar cells. The photovoltaic (PV) performance of the re-fabricated 4″ solar cell was measured by conventional solar cell processing, which shows the best results reported so far. The higher boron (B) concentration and reflectance of the re-fabricated solar cell reduced cell efficiency by 0.6% compared with the commercial 6″ solar cell. However, it has sufficient potential for use in the PV industry.

Abstract: In this work, we report a facile and novel approach to produce zinc titanate (ZnTiO3) powders of nanoporous nanoparticulate matter which show an improved photocatalytic activity under visible light illumination. The method consists of calcining the electrospun fibrous mats obtained by electrospinning a sol with a solution of guiding polymer that yields a white crystalline nanopowder. The powder's crystallinity was characterized by XRD which confirmed ZnTiO3 with a hexagonal structure. We have examined the photocatalytic activity of these powders by studying the photocatalytic degradation reaction of phenol in the presence of visible light from an incandescent light bulb. A comparison of the photocatalytic activity of our material with that of the powders prepared by other standard routes such as the bulk sol-gel method and the sol-gel method in presence of surfactant (CTAB) shows that the nanopowders obtained by calcining the electrospun-sols afford a much better photocatalytic activity in presence of the visible light. Surface area analysis of these nanopowders suggest an enhanced surface area per unit volume and that the nanoparticles are nanoporous. The enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity is believed to be originating chiefly from the enhanced surface area as confirmed by the BET analysis, and larger carrier lifetimes as confirmed by the photoluminescence spectra. The reaction kinetics studied by monitoring the UV–Visible absorption spectra of phenol shows a first order decay kinetics in each case with the powder samples of calcined electrospun-sols giving the highest rate constant.

Abstract: Solar heat blocking materials, which can not only strongly shield the near infrared (NIR) heat rays, but also retain high visible transparency, have been widely studied and used in energy conservation of buildings. In this work, a complete process for preparation of waveband two-component transparent NIR shielding (WTNS) coatings combined ATO (antimony doped tin oxide) and Cs0.33WO3 nanomaterials is proposed. ATO and Cs0.33WO3 were synthesized by controllable hydrothermal methods and dispersed by a ball mill with silane coupling agents. The transmittance spectra demonstrate that WTNS coated glass shows excellent NIR shielding performance in a wide-band wavelength from 780nm to 2500nm, which could shield the NIR light as much as 90.9% and retain high transparency in the visible light of 70.6%. The overall energy performance assessment of this NIR shielding coatings was obtained, which includes thermal chamber test and software simulation in EnergyPlus. The chamber tests reveal the superior thermal insulation ability of WTNS coatings. The simulations indicate that for the area like Hong Kong which is cooling dominated areas, WTNS coated glass has the best energy performance which can significantly save up to 15.22% and 9.15% electricity per year in comparison with the normal glass and low-e glass, respectively.

Abstract: This paper reports an extensive analysis of the potential-induced degradation (PID) of N-type bifacial solar cells. The analysis is based on combined electrical characterization, electroluminescence and external quantum efficiency measurements, carried out on solar cells submitted to high PID stresses. We investigate the impact of two different encapsulation materials: (i) polyolefin elastomer (POE) and (ii) ethylene-vinyl-acetate (EVA). We describe the degradation and recovery kinetics as a function of the temperature and the stress voltage. Moreover we demonstrate that the POE can be adopted to reduce the decrease of conversion efficiency during PID stresses. Finally we investigate the effects of PID with an optical analysis in order to find the main cause of the performance degradation.

Abstract: In this work, the efficiency of n-type silicon solar cells with a front side boron-doped emitter and a full-area tunnel oxide passivating electron contact was studied experimentally as a function of wafer thickness W and resistivity ρb. Conversion efficiencies in the range of 25.0% have been obtained for all variations studied in this work, which cover 150µm to 400µm thick wafers and resistivities from 1Ωcm to 10Ωcm. We present a detailed cell analysis based on three-dimensional full-area device simulations using the solar cell simulation tool Quokka. We show that the experimental variation of the wafer thickness and resistivity at device level in combination with a detailed simulation study allows the identification of recombination induced loss mechanisms. This is possible because different recombination mechanisms can have a very specific influence on the I-V parameters as a function of W and ρb. In fact, we identified Shockley-Read-Hall recombination in the c-Si bulk as the source of a significant FF reduction in case of high resistivity Si. This shows that cells made of high resistivity Si are very sensitive to even a weak lifetime limitation in the c-Si bulk. Applying low resistivity 1Ωcm n-type Si in combination with optimized fabrication processes, we achieved confirmed efficiency values of 25.7%, with a VOC of 725mV, a FF of 83.3% and a JSC of 42.5mA/cm2. This represents the highest efficiency reported for both-sides contacted c-Si solar cells. Thus, the results presented in this work demonstrate not only the potential of the cell structure, but also that a variation of the wafer thickness and resistivity at device level can provide deep insights into the cell performance.

Abstract: As stability of perovskite solar cells remains a significant research topic, it is important to be able to predict the long-term stability of any new kinds of perovskite solar cells when new perovskite absorber materials or transport layers or new cell structures are being demonstrated. This work reports a reliable method of determining degradation rate which is resulted from thermal stress. By incorporating three kinds of accelerated tests, the activation energy for photo-thermally driven degradation processes of perovskites solar cells was determined, which is then used to predict its long-term stability using an Arrhenius equation. In addition, thermal stability of CH3NH3PbI3, HC(NH2)2PbI3, PTAA (poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethyl phenyl)amine]) and Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2',7,7'-Tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]−9,9'-spirobifluorene) are studied. The thermal stability of a planar HC(NH2)2PbI3/PTAA device is better than a planar HC(NH2)2PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD device which in turn is better than a planar CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD device due to better thermal stability of HC(NH2)2PbI3 and PTAA. It is predicted that a planar HC(NH2)2PbI3/PTAA device can have a lifetime of more than 3 years (or 1.5 years) at room temperature if 50% (or 25%) drop in power output can be tolerated. While these lifetimes are specific to perovskite material chosen, preparation method and solar cell design, the lifetime prediction method reported here can be verified experimentally. Therefore, the lifetime calculation method developed in this work is a quick and useful tool for determining the relative stability of a perovskite device especially when comparing the merits of different cell structure designs.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates a straightforward strategy to improve the TiO2-based solar cell performances employing highly qualified copper-indium-sulfide (CIS) ternary colloids. The CIS colloids in different In/Cu ratios of 1–4 capped with thioglycolic acid (TGA) were prepared in “green” water media. And, subsequently the CIS colloidal solutions were treated with microwave (MW)-irradiation at different temperatures (80–200℃) for 5min. The preferable solar cell employing CIS colloids in In/Cu ratio of 2 treated at 160℃ showed high photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) yielding with 6.12% (short-circuit current: 14.0mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage: 0.91V and fill factor: 48.0%). To our best knowledge, this value is the highest among the solar cells employing CIS colloids prepared in water media. It was also confirmed that the MW-irradiation improved the light absorption of the CIS colloids as well as induced photo-electrochemical cathodic shift of the Fermi levels for the CIS-TiO2 photoelectrode due to the reduction of defective sites involved in the CIS colloids.

Abstract: In this study, smart glass with the property of auto-adjust transparency was constructed to economize the consumption of energy by screening sunlight irradiation entering a building. Graphene oxide (GO), a photothermal conversion material, when intercalated within a thermotropic hydrogel can effectively convert the photoenergy of sunlight into thermal energy and cause the smart glass to reach an opaque state owing to the increased temperature of the hydrogel heated by solar light, as a result, reducing the incident intensity of solar energy and room temperature. In addition, GO embedded within the thermotropic hydrogel absorbs the colored organic solvent, which provides the smart glass with arbitrary color.

Abstract: Organic phase change materials (PCMs) have relatively high latent heat capacities, are stable, nontoxic, and not corrosive. Having such advantages, organic PCMs shall find applications in many more thermal energy storage (TES) systems. Currently their main handicap is finding a cost-effective, environmentally benign and compatible encapsulation method. This study uses SiO2, which is preferred in several biocompatible applications, as shell material to microencapsulate two different organic PCMs: Paraffin and Stearic acid. Nanocapsules of these PCMs with sizes in the range of 20–700nm were produced by in situ emulsion interfacial hydrolysis and polycondensation technique. The resulting microencapsulation ratios observed were 11% for paraffin (PA) and 23% for stearic acid (SA).

Abstract: Increasing photovoltaic conversion efficiency by overcoming the fundamental loss mechanisms due to hot carrier thermalisation remains one of the challenges in solar energy research. A large proportion of dynamic energy is lost due to thermalisation where hot carriers lose their energy to lattice vibrations within picoseconds. Extending hot carrier lifetimes will potentially improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. In this study, the bulk hafnium nitride film is proposed as a potential hot carrier absorber from its phononic properties. Hafnium nitride thin films were deposited by sputtering on quartz substrates. The films are polycrystalline as determined from X-ray diffraction and from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy the chemical composition of the films are estimated to be HfN0.9. The absorption coefficient of the film exhibits strong amplitude below 500nm and free electron absorption at longer wavelengths. Transient absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate carrier dynamics in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. For the first time we present evidence of up to nanosecond long lifetimes of photo-excited carriers observed in hafnium nitride. We propose that the long lived excited states are due to restricted phonon decay pathways in hafnium nitride. The long lived excited states in the bulk hafnium nitride film provide a simple route to devices designed to utilise hot carriers efficiently.

Abstract: A microencapsulated phase change composite, in which paraffin as the core and graphite nanoparticles embedded melamine–formaldehyde (MF) as the shell, has been prepared and characterized. The paraffin@MF/graphite composite is composed of spherical particles with diameters ranging from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers. Raman spectroscopy analyses confirm the existence of graphite on the shell of the paraffin@MF/graphite composite. DSC results indicate that the melting temperature and latent heat of the paraffin@MF/graphite composite are 50.5°C and 90.8Jg−1, respectively, in which the mass ratio of paraffin is calculated to be 51.1%. The paraffin@MF/graphite composite can be dispersed into the ionic liquid to form a novel latent functional thermal fluid (LFTF). It is found that the temperature of the LFTF can increase from 30 to 113°C under irradiation, indicating its remarkable photo-thermal conversion performance. The thermal storage capacity of this new kind of heat transfer fluid (HTF) is twice larger than pure ionic liquid. The high heat storage capability and excellent photo-thermal conversion performance enable the paraffin@MF/graphite composite as a potential material for solar energy utilization.

Abstract: Leptin monotherapy is sufficient to restore euglycemia in insulinopenic type 1 diabetes (T1D), yet the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the brain mediates the leptin action on euglycemia restoration. Here, we first review evidence supporting that symptoms in T1D resemble an uncontrolled response to fasting. Then, we discuss recent research progress on brain neurons and their neurotransmitters that potentially mediate the leptin action. Finally, peripheral effective pathways, which are normally involved in fasting responses and associated with leptin action on euglycemia restoration in T1D, will also be discussed. This summary complements several previous excellent reviews on this topic (Meek and Morton, 2016; Perry et al., 2016; Fujikawa and Coppari, 2015). A deep understanding of neurocircuitry and the peripheral effective pathways that mediate the leptin action on euglycemia restoration will likely lead to novel targets for an insulin-independent therapeutics against T1D.

Abstract: Iron–sulfur clusters perform essential functions in enzymatic catalysis and homeostatic regulation. Here we for the first time identified Ssq1 as an essential component for iron–sulfur cluster assembly in Candida albicans. Ssq1 played an important role in cell growth. Shutting off SSQ1 led to accumulation of intracellular iron, especially in mitochondria, and disorder of intracellular iron regulation. In tetO-SSQ1, iron overloading triggered the oxidative damage of mitochondrial function. Surprisingly, disruption of SSQ1 activated autophagic pathway. The mitochondrial dysfunction was further aggravated when CCZ1 (which is essential for autophagy) and SSQ1 was simultaneously deleted, suggesting that autophagy played a critical role in maintenance of mitochondrial function in tetO-SSQ1. In addition, double deletion of SSQ1 and CCZ1 further elevated cellular iron levels in comparison with tetO-SSQ1, indicating that autophagy participated in maintenance of iron homeostasis. Furthermore, we found that loss of SSQ1 led to increasing protein expression of Rnr1 and redistribution of Rnr2 from the nucleus to cytoplasm, and further resulted in cell cycle arrest. The results implied that cell cycle arrest was caused by activating the checkpoint pathway because of impairing the iron–sulfur cluster assembly in tetO-SSQ1. Shutting off SSQ1 led to a significant defect in filamentous development. Interestingly, the tetO-SSQ1ccz1Δ/Δ growth was inhibited on hyphae-inducing solid media. Both tetO-SSQ1 and tetO-SSQ1ccz1Δ/Δ exhibited extremely attenuated virulence, indicating that Ssq1 might provide a promising target for antifungal drugs development. In summary, our findings provide new insights into the understanding of iron–sulfur cluster assembly-related gene in C. albicans.

Abstract: We report efficient, planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells prepared via bar coating that are compatible with large-scale fabrication on flexible substrates. Our MAPbI3 perovskite devices by bar coating method achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.0% using a ITO/PEDOT: PSS/CH3NH3PbI3(MAPbI3)/PCBM/Ag structure, and there is very weak hysteresis in these devices. After formulation of the precursor solution and optimization of the coating process, planar perovskite thin films containing large-size grains with low surface roughness were obtained. We found that anti-solvent plays an important role in determining the uniformity, size of grains and width of grain boundaries in perovskite films. The addition of 5vol% isopropanol into the precursor solution leads to the formation of large aspect ratio grains with a length ca. 200µm and width of a few hundred nanometers, together with narrow grain boundaries. However, the absence or excessive of isopropanol result in perovskite films with high surface roughness and broad grain boundaries due to inefficient crystal growth or the formation of ridges between crystal grains. These grain boundaries have high PL intensity due to charge recombination and consequently deteriorate device efficiency. When bar-coating the perovskite films in air, best devices with PCE over 11% can be achieved with a relatively high humidity around 50%, eliminating the low humidity requirement during air processing.

Abstract: Tin oxide (SnO2) has recently attracted significant research interest for its role functioning as an efficient electron-transporting layer (ETL) due to its higher charge mobility than the commonly used titanium oxide (TiO2) for realizing high-performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). However, it is still challenging to develop a facile, low-temperature solution-based (<100oC) processing method to synthesize crystalline SnO2 with desirable charge mobility, which can facilitate its widespread applications in flexible optoelectronic devices. In this work, we utilize an electrochemical deposition technique to prepare SnO2 films at a reduced temperature below 100 oC. The electrodeposition endows the SnO2 film with high crystallinity and conductivity in addition to high transparency across the visible spectrum. Efficient photoluminescence (PL) quenching is observed in the bi-layered SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film, manifesting its efficient electron extraction capability from perovskite. Consequently, a conventional n-i-p PVSC using this electrodeposited SnO2 ETL shows a high PCE of 13.88% with negligible hysteresis. This work demonstrates a low-temperature solution-based preparation route for making crystalline SnO2 and its potential for application in large-scale PVSC production.

Abstract: This work shows a novel fabrication process of interdigitated back-contacted c-Si(n) solar cells based on laser-doped point contacts. In this approach, all the highly-doped regions have been entirely fabricated through UV laser processing of dielectric layers, avoiding the high temperature steps typically involved in conventional diffusion processes. Additionally, the number of patterning steps has been significantly reduced. Aluminum oxide films deposited by thermal ALD on the front surface passivate and reduce reflection losses, while at the rear surface the same films are also used as aluminum source for p+ emitter contacts. n+ regions are created by laser processing a phosphorus-doped amorphous silicon carbide stack deposited by PECVD. As a proof of concept, solar cells (3×3cm2) have been fabricated with efficiencies beyond 20% with short-circuit current densities and open-circuit voltages up to 40.7mA/cm2 and 654mV respectively.

Abstract: Metals are promising high-temperature phase change materials (PCMs) with high heat storage density and high heat exchange rate for high high-temperature heat storage. However, encapsulation of metallic PCMs is essential for its practical application owing to its highly corrosive to encapsulation materials and its volume expansion during the phase change. The present study applied spouted bed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to encapsulate metallic PCMs. A novel heat storage capsule was developed using iron core encapsulated with porous pyrolytic carbon (PyC) layer, dense PyC layer and dense silicon carbide (SiC) layer in turn from inside to outside. The inner porous PyC layer is used to accommodate the volume expansion of the iron core and the outer dense SiC layer act as package layer and the oxidation resistance layer. The SiC/C-shells/Fe-core capsules could work at a temperature up to 1100°C and include solid-solid phase change (48.85J/g, 686°C) and solid-liquid phase change (128J/g，1136°C). It is demonstrated that the SiC/C-shells/Fe-core capsules have several desired characteristics, such as high thermal conductivity and high thermal density, excellent oxidation resistance and good thermal cycling performance.

Abstract: The capability of thermotropic glazing to reduce stagnation temperatures in solar thermal collectors is evaluated in in-situ testing (south-façade of an office building). Therefore, a thermotropic formulation which is curable by sunlight and which exhibits both, excellent light-shielding characteristics (transmittance reduction by ~20%) and long-term stability is specifically designed. Application relevant overheating protection efficiency is given: absorber temperatures are reduced by up to 29K in collector stagnation. Performance characteristics are not changed during the six month period of in-situ testing. The application demonstration emphasizes the high innovative capacity of thermotropic materials.

Abstract: The degradation kinetics of multicrystalline silicon solar cells and wafers at elevated temperature (often termed “LeTID”) depend on the specific temperature and injection conditions. We apply different forward biases in the dark at a constant temperature of ~75°C to industrial passivated emitter rear contacted (PERC) solar cells fabricated on p-type multicrystalline wafers from a variety of material producers and determine the degradation rate constant in dependence of the excess carrier density at the p-n junction. We find that whereas the specific material properties influence the degradation extent, the degradation rate constant is comparable for all materials but depends on the excess carrier concentration. This implies involvement of one electron in the rate-limiting step of LeTID defect formation. The result not only is an important contribution to elucidate the physical mechanism underlying LeTID, but can also be used as a guideline for devising degradation tests of multicrystalline silicon wafers and solar cells.

Abstract: Ionically conductive membranes of gelatin and d-PCL(530)/siloxane doped with cyano-based ionic liquids (ILs) were prepared through solvent casting and sol-gel methods, respectively. The membranes were characterized in terms of ionic conductivity, thermal behavior, morphology, and structure. All samples, except the d-PCL(530)/siloxane matrix, exhibited a predominantly amorphous morphology. The samples prepared through solvent casting and sol-gel displayed a minimum thermal stability of 170 and 230°C, respectively. The ionic conductivity varied according with the type, quantity, and length of the alkyl chain of the cation of the ILs. The sample with the highest ionic conductivity was gelatin0.5[C2mim][N(CN)2] with 2.40×10−3Scm−1 at 25°C and 1.68×10−2Scm−1 at 95°C. The good results of ionic conductivity encouraged the assembly and characterization of prototypes of electrochromic devices (ECDs). The best results were obtained with glass/ITO/WO3/gelatin1[C2mim][SCN]/CeO2-TiO2/ITO/glass configuration that showed a fast color switching time (~15s) and a good open circuit memory (~4h). The ECD changed its color from pale blue to transparent, and its charge density decreased from −17.53 to −2.71mCcm−2 during 640 color/bleaching cycles.

Abstract: Adaptive suspended particle device (SPD) switchable glazing is promising for low energy building application. SPD glazing allows light passes through it in the presence of applied voltage and block light in the absence of power supply. In this work SPD glazing performance after 3 years of outdoor exposure was evaluated. It was found that contrast ratio of SPD glazing before and after exposures changed from 1:11 to 1:10. SPD glazing surface temperature for any transparency level varies between 13 and 40°C under indoor and outdoor thermal exposure. SPD glazing's surface temperature variation occurs due to the incident radiation level, not for the transmission level of glazing. Voltage and power requirement of SPD glazing did not vary at elevated glazing surface temperature.

Abstract: In this study, the spectrally selective solar absorber coatings of TiN/Al2O3 are deposited onto stainless steels (SS) at a high substrate temperature of 300°C, which exhibits a high absorptance of 0.92 and a low emittance of 0.11 at 82°C. The structure, optical properties and thermal stability have been characterized by ultra-high resolution scanning electron microscopy, UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The study's results indicate that the substrate temperature (300°C) has an important effect on the solar absorptance and emittance. The SS/TiN/Al2O3 coating exhibits good thermal stability in a vacuum at 500°C for 5h. The coating also exhibits good thermal stability in air at 200°C for 2h. Raman analysis confirms that the oxidation of the SS/TiN/Al2O3 coating in air causes the composition to approach the stable oxide TiO2.

Abstract: SiNx and SiNx:Tb3+ thin layers were deposited by reactive magnetron co-sputtering with the objective of optimizing the light management in Si solar cells. Those Si-based layers are developed to be compatible with the Si-PV technology. An efficient energy transfer between SiNx matrix and terbium ions (Tb3+), enhancing this system absorption, has been demonstrated and optimized. The layer composition and microstructure as well as its optical properties have been analyzed with the aim of improving both its anti-reflective properties and its luminescence emission intensity. An optimized layer was obtained by co-sputtering of Si and Tb targets in a nitrogen rich atmosphere. The emission efficiency of the SiNx:Tb3+ layer is compared to the one of previously optimized SiOxNy:Tb3+ layer. Finally we show how SiNx:Tb3+ thin films may be integrated on top of Si solar cells and act simultaneously as a down-shifting layer and antireflective coating.

Abstract: The SASH1 gene is discovered as a tumor suppressor recently. However, the molecular mechanisms of SASH1 in hepatocarcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In present studies, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of SASH1 on cell invasion and metastasis of hepatocarcinoma in vivo and in vitro. In this study, SASH1 overexpression HCC cell lines were treated with purmorphamine (0, 0.5, 1, 2μmol/l). Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to examine the related gene expression of EMT markers and the Shh-Gli1 and PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by Transwell assay. In addition, a mice SASH1 overexpression HCC orthotopic xenograft model was established and treated with purmorphamine or 740Y-P or PDGF. Tumor volume was assessed, and H&E staining was applied to histopathologic analysis. The results showed that purmorphamine exposure significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of Shh and Gli1 in a dose-dependent manner in the SASH1 overexpression HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells. Besides, purmorphamine promoted the migration and invasion of SASH1 overexpression HCC cells, as well as the EMT progress. Moreover, purmorphamine significantly increased the synthesis of PI3K and pAkt in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the invasion and migration abilities were also improved by treatment with 740Y-P or PDGF in the SASH1 overexpression HCC cells. Additionally, the agonists promoted tumor growth and intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis of the orthotopic transplantation tumors grown from SASH1 overexpression HCC cells in vivo. In conclusion, SASH1 may inhibit hepatocarcinoma cell invasion and metastasis through down-regulating the Shh-Gli1 and PI3K-AKT pathways in vivo and in vitro.

Abstract: The thermal stability of copper substrate material used in solar thermal collectors was investigated with and without atomic layer deposited (ALD) hafnium oxide barrier films at temperatures of 200–400°C. HfO2 films were studied as barriers against thermal diffusion of copper substrate atoms. The ALD HfO2 thin films were deposited in a thermal process at 200°C using Tetrakis(Dimethylamido)Hafnium(Hf(NMe2)4) and H2O precursors, with 200, 400, and 600 cycles. The Cu substrates with and without HfO2 thin films were aged by means of heat treatment in air. The influence of the HfO2 barriers was determined by optical, microstructural, and morphological analyses before and after the ageing procedures. The optical performance of the HfO2 barriers as a part of solar absorber stack was modelled with CODE Coating Designer. The copper surface without a HfO2 barrier thin film oxidized significantly, which increased thermal emittance and surface roughness. 200 cycles of HfO2 deposition did not result in a completely continuous coating and only provided a little protection against oxidation. Films of 200 and 400 cycles gave continuous coverage and the thickest HfO2 thin film studied, which was deposited from 600 ALD cycles and had a thickness ~50nm, prevented Cu oxidation and diffusion processes after 2h heat treatment in air at 300°C, and retained low thermal emissivity. At 400°C, diffusion and formation of copper oxide hillocks were observed but the HfO2 thin film significantly retarded the degradation when compared to a Cu substrate without and with thinner barrier layers.

Abstract: As the efficiency of silicon solar cells increases continuously, recombination at the metal contacts becomes more and more limiting, unless the contacts are passivated. Passivating contact layers on the front side, however, usually lead to parasitic absorption. To prevent this we develop a new self-aligned deposition process to implement a passivating layer only under the metal contacts. As passivating layer for the contacts on an optically highly transparent boron emitter we use PEDOT:PSS, which can be electro-polymerized at an anodic surface in an aqueous electrolyte. This electro-deposition technique is used to deposit PEDOT:PSS in the openings of the patterned dielectric passivation layers on the boron emitter of an n-type silicon solar cell. We demonstrate that the electrical properties of the electro-deposited PEDOT:PSS layer are suitable for a passivating contact layer and that the Fermi-level is de-pinned at the interface with silicon.

Abstract: An analysis of BiFeO3, focusing on its absorption properties, is carried out using experimental results from the literature and first-principles. In order to identify the different contributions to the absorption coefficient, the results have been split into inter- and intra-atomic contributions. Its potential as a photovoltaic material has been evaluated using both theoretical and experimental optical results. Because of the ferroelectric properties, we have considered two mechanisms for generating photocurrent: the traditional radiative and the ferroelectric or photovoltaic effects. The efficiencies, when ferroelectric photogeneration coexists with the traditional photovoltaic mechanism, are only slightly larger than when only the latter is considered. However, the increase in efficiency is significant with just multi-gap solar cells.

Abstract: Mesoporous TiO2 films were modified with Sm(NO3)3·6H2O and TiCl4 mixture solution in dye-sensitized solar cells. Samarium oxide was formed after modification according to UV–vis absorption spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analyses, and acted as energy barrier on TiO2 surface. The electron recombination reaction with I3− can be suppressed when samples are treated using Sm3+/TiCl4 solutions via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) analyses. With the mesoporous TiO2 film modified by the TiCl4 mixture solution contained 0.07M samarium trinitrate, the power conversion efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar cell is increased from 6.91% to 8.23%. The enhanced performance is ascribed to the increase of dye loading, the reduce of surface state density, and the energy barrier created on TiO2 surface. It is a effective method to improve the power conversion efficiency without requiring a tedious synthesis pathway.

Abstract: Nanomaterials with a broadband photon absorption capability are essential for better performing solar cells. Plasmonic nanostructures and Quantum Dots, often fabricated via complex time intensive methods, have a narrow absorption spectrum. In this paper, we report a plasmon hybridised self-assembled 3D nano network of multiphase titanium oxide, which was synthesised via a single step bottoms-up method, and is structurally both multi-layered and three dimensional in nature. The surface plasmonic effect was induced on the self-assembled nanomaterial through its hybridisation with Au and Au/palladium alloy that resulted in the achievement of an enhanced and broadened absorption spectrum extending over the entire visible as well as the near infrared region of the solar spectrum. Further studies were also carried out to examine the impact of various factors like the size, composition and degree of hybridisation of the self-assembled 3D multiphase nano titanium oxide network on its photon absorption capability.

Abstract: We quantitatively and analytically investigate the properties of buffer/window junctions and their effects on the energy band alignment and the current-voltage characteristics of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells with solution processed silver nanowire (AgNW) composite window layers. AgNWs are generally embedded in a moderately conductive matrix layer to ensure lateral collection efficiency of charge carriers photogenerated in the lateral gaps present between AgNWs. Studies on the junctions between a buffer and AgNW-composite window layers and their effects on the performances of CIGS thin film solar cells have seldom been addressed. Here, we show that solution processed AgNW-composite window layers could induce defect states at the buffer/window interface, resulting in poor energy band alignment impeding carrier transport in the solar cells. On the basis of our analysis, we suggest an analytical expression of nmatrixDi2≥3.46×10−5ε cm to avoid losses in the power conversion efficiency of the solar cells. nmatrix is the carrier concentration in a matrix layer embedding AgNWs, Di is the negative defect density at the buffer/window interface, and ε is the relative dielectric constant of the matrix layer embedding AgNWs.

Abstract: A general procedure for predicting metal grid performance in solar cells was developed. Unlike transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) or other homogeneous films, metal grids induce more resistance in the neighbor layer. The resulting balance of transmittance, neighbor and grid resistance was explored in light of cheap lithography advances that have enabled metal nano-grid (MNG) fabrication. The patterned MNGs have junction resistances and degradation rates that are more favorable than solution-synthesized metal nanowires. Neighbor series resistance was simulated by the finite element method, although a simpler analytical model was sufficient in most cases. Finite-difference frequency-domain transmittance simulations were performed for MNGs with minimum wire width (w) of 50nm, but deviations from aperture transmittance were small in magnitude. Depending on the process, MNGs can exhibit increased series resistance as w is decreased. However, numerous experimental reports have already achieved transmittance-MNG sheet resistance trade-offs comparable to TCOs. The transmittance, neighbor and MNG series resistances were used to parameterize a grid fill factor for a solar cell. This new figure of merit was used to demonstrate that although MNGs have only been employed in low efficiency solar cells, substantial gains in performance are predicted for decreased w in all high efficiency absorber technologies.

Abstract: Thin film solar cells based on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS), where just the buffer layer is changed, were fabricated and studied. The effects of two different buffer layers, CdS and ZnxSn1−xOy (ZnSnO), are compared using several characterization techniques. We compared both devices and observe that the ZnSnO-based solar cells have similar values of power conversion efficiency as compared to the cells with CdS buffer layers. The ZnSnO-based devices have higher values in the short-circuit current (Jsc) that compensate for lower values in fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (Voc) than CdS based devices. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) results indicate that CdS provides junctions with slightly higher surface photovoltage (SPV) than ZnSnO, thus explaining the lower Voc potential for the ZnSnO sample. The TEM analysis shows a poly-crystalline ZnSnO layer and we have not detected any strong evidence of diffusion of Zn or Sn into the CIGS. From the photoluminescence measurements, we concluded that both samples are being affected by fluctuating potentials, although this effect is higher for the CdS sample.

Abstract: In this work, Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorbers with thicknesses ranging from 2µm to 370nm were prepared by a two-step process using electrodeposition of Cu-In-Ga followed by annealing under a pure Se atmosphere. Based on compositional characterizations, it is shown that in order to decrease the thickness of the precursors, it is not enough to reduce only the deposition time of Cu-In-Ga layers without working on the composition and deposition parameters of the thin films. After the optimization of annealing conditions, the properties of the absorbers and solar cells with three different thicknesses (2µm, 0.7µm and 0.37µm) were compared. It is shown that, in spite of the decreasing thickness, hence a decrease in JSC, the VOC of ultrathin CIGS electrodeposited solar cells can be improved due to an increase in the Ga content of the electrodeposited absorbers. Without deliberate light trapping and anti-reflecting coating from the very thin absorber layer of 0.37µm, an efficiency of 8.7% with VOC of 685mV, JSC of 19mA/cm2 and FF of 67%, was achieved.

Abstract: Organic solar cells subjected to environmental stressors such as heat, moisture, and UV radiation can undergo significant mechanical degradation, leading to delamination of layers and device failure. This paper reports the effect these stressors have on the mechanical integrity of active layers and interfaces as measured by subcritical debonding tests, and the in situ evolution of defects and fracture processes is characterized. At elevated temperatures below 50°C in inert conditions, significant device weakening was observed, an effect we attributed to a temperature-induced P3HT:PCBM delamination mechanism from the underlying ZnO. At 50°C in ambient conditions with UV exposure—selected to better simulate real-world environments—devices were more resistant to fracture because of an interfacial strengthening effect from increased hydrogen bonding where UV-induced Zn(OH)2 formation reinforced the interface with P3HT:PCBM. This photoinduced hydroxylation mechanism was determined from a decrease in the Zn/O ratio with increased UVA or UVB exposure, and hydroxylation was shown to directly correlate with the resistance to fracture in devices.

Abstract: A model that relates the relatively low Fill Factor (FF) in p+/n amorphous/crystalline silicon (a-Si:H/c-Si) hetero-junction solar cells (SHJ) with perfectly ohmic contacts, to hole reflection at the hetero-interface under illumination is proposed. Such a reflection results from the partial emission and transport of holes imposed by the thermionic emission boundary condition at the hetero-interface. The non-emitted holes scatter back and diffuse towards the substrate. The probability of hole reflection depends on the thermionic emission parameters and also on the diffusion barrier associated with the pn junction adjacent to the hetero-interface. With such hole reflection the cell forward current under illumination is enhanced well above the cell dark current leading to Fill Factor and efficiency degradation. Such effects are found to be particularly significant in cells with deficient active doping in a-Si:H. The model is supported by the results of AFORS-HET simulations at room temperature and at different temperatures. When the model predictions are taken into account, p+/n SHJ cells with minimum hole reflection and FF's exceeding 81% could be designed.

Abstract: Previously, IMEC proposed the i2-module concept which allows to process silicon heterojunction interdigitated back-contact (SHJ-IBC) cells on thin (<50µm) Si wafers at module level. This concept includes the bonding of the thin wafer early on to the module cover glass, which delivers mechanical support to the wafer and thus significantly improves the production yield. In this work, we test silicone and ethylene vinyl acetate bonding agents and prove them to be resistant to all rear side processes, including wet and plasma processes. Moreover, a lift-off process using a sacrificial SiOx layer has been developed for emitter patterning to replace conventional lithography. The optimized process steps are demonstrated by the fabrication of SHJ-IBC cells on 6-inch 190µm-thick wafers. Efficiencies up to 22.6% have been achieved on reference freestanding wafers. Excellent Voc of 734 mv and Jsc of 40.8mA/cm2 lead to an efficiency of 21.7% on silicone-bonded cells, where the high Voc indicates the process compatibility of the bonding agent. The developments that enabled such achievements and the key factors that limit the device performance are discussed in this paper.

Abstract: We investigate Cr-doped ZnS (ZnS: Cr) as a potential deep-level intermediate band material for high efficiency solar cells. We study n-ZnO:Al/ZnS:Cr/p-GaP heterojunction cell for the first time, and this paper presents an interpretation of the performance of the solar cell in the framework of intermediate band solar cells. We conclude that the ZnS:Cr used in this work has two characteristic energy levels at 0.88eV and 2.68eV below the conduction band. This material also has a quasi-continuum of energy levels between the former level and the valence band maximum. This quasi-continuum results in thermal carrier escape that limits the open-circuit voltage to the lowest energy gap in ZnS: Cr, ≃0.8V.

Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of ultra-thin a-Si:H solar cells on various transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coated glass substrates. We find that the highly textured boron doped zinc oxide (BZO) with multi-scale features made with metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) outperforms the flat aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) deposited by sputtering and the highly textured AZO with only large features after the chemical etching with diluted HCl. We believe that the much larger features than the cell thickness provide only an enhancement of the effective area for increasing the light absorption, while the variable sizes of features similar to and smaller than cell thickness provide- a highly effective light trapping for thin film solar cells. In addition, the ultra-thin a-Si:H solar cell on the BZO has a better p/i interface than the cell on the AZO substrates, which leads to a high cell performance. A high efficiency of 8.15% was obtained using an a-Si:H p-i-n structure on the BZO with the intrinsic layer of 70nm.

Abstract: We report on the fabrication and analysis of highly optically reflective textured stacks consisting of silver oxide (Ag2O) coated silver for application as scattering back reflectors in thin-film solar cells. Thin Ag2O layers have been formed on textured silver back reflectors by using a UV-ozone (UVO) exposure technique, and during this formation, the stacks display improvement in their diffuse reflectance, particularly in the near infrared (NIR) spectral region. The silver oxide formed is composed of densely packed small grains with sizes from 20nm to 50nm, and their formation measurably increases the roughness of the silver reflector. The optimized silver reflector showed a ~ 6% increase in diffuse reflectance in the spectral range from 800nm to 1100nm while maintaining excellent total reflectance (over 95%). As a result, a high haze value (~ 98%) in the NIR region was achieved using these stacks. The stacks were tested as the back reflector in microcrystalline silicon solar cells. Due to the improved optical properties of the back reflector, a higher external quantum efficiency in the NIR region was obtained, and thus an increased short current density (from 22.3mA/cm2 to 23.6mA/cm2). It is also worth noting that the open circuit voltage was unchanged (0.529V) while the fill factor also increased (from 66.3% to 72.3%).

Abstract: Titanium diboride (TiB2) is a low-density refractory material belonging to the family of ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs). This paper reports on the production and microstructural and optical characterization of nearly fully dense TiB2, with particular interest to its potential utilization as novel thermal solar absorber. Monolithic bulk samples are produced starting from elemental reactants by a two-step method consisting of the Self-propagating High-temperature Synthesis (SHS) followed by the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) of the resulting powders. The surface of obtained samples has-been characterized from the microstructural and topological points of view. The hemispherical reflectance spectrum has been measured from 0.3 to 15µm wavelength, to evaluate the potential of this material as solar absorber for future concentrating solar plants.

Abstract: Within (crystalline silicon) solar cell modeling, a skin means the thin region from the quasi-neutral bulk to the actual surface or metal contact, including e.g. doping profiles, induced band-bending or top-cells of a tandem configuration. A typical highly doped skin is commonly characterized by its main lumped properties: effective recombination via J0,skin and lateral conductance via Rsheet. When applied as a boundary condition to bulk carrier transport modeling, it is known as the conductive boundary model. However, the detailed resolution of physics inside the skin is then lacking but required in many cases, and possible complexities, like injection dependence of the lumped parameters, are commonly neglected. This work introduces a general parameterization of skins, which accounts fully for injection dependence and a vertical resistance, and is thus able to accurately describe arbitrarily complex skins by lumped parameters. A “skin solver” is implemented in the solar cell simulation software Quokka3 to solve a detailed skin in 1D and to perform the general parameterization. Additionally, the performance of the multidimensional quasi-neutral bulk (qn-bulk) solver is largely improved compared to Quokka2, enabling, for the first time, the 3D discretization and solution of up to an entire 156mm × 156mm solar cell in manageable computing times. Quokka3 can then consistently couple the skin solver with the qn-bulk solver. With this multiscale modeling approach, the user can define and solve a solar cell device including the details of the skins orders of magnitude faster compared to generic device simulation software, without loss of accuracy for the majority of conditions in wafer-based silicon solar cells. The new capabilities are demonstrated by showing how the front phosphorus diffusion of a PERC solar cell can be optimized with unprecedented completeness and accuracy. Besides accurately modeling 3D current transport in the bulk, the single solution domain intrinsically accounts for the busbar influence (both recombination and shading), the distributed resistance of the fingers, and the limited current collection independent of the surface area enlargement by texturing.

Abstract: The present study reports the fabrication and performance of swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiated transparent conducting electrode (TCE) having oxide-metal-oxide multilayer structure; ZnO/Ag/ZnO (ZAZ) deposited at room temperature and exhibiting electrical and optical properties comparable to that of commercial ITO. Pristine and SHI irradiated films show a good stability of electrical parameters; sheet resistance, carrier concentration and mobility of charge carriers under temperature variation from 80 to 340K. This shows that these films are stable and hence suitable for application in this temperature range. The sputter deposited ZAZ multilayer structure has sheet resistance 24Ω/□ and average transparency 80% in the visible spectrum. The obtained values of sheet resistance and average transmittance after SHI irradiation of 100MeV Ag ions with fluence 5E12 ions/cm2 are 27Ω/□ and ~70%. Ion-induced sputtering of metal ions which get embedded in oxide layer creates centres for the scattering of light that leads to loss of ~10% transparency. The crystalline ZAZ structure shows smooth surface morphology and chemical stability before and after heavy ions treatment. The change in sheet resistance of the multilayer structure in the temperature range 80–340K (δRS) is ~3.1Ω/□ for pristine and 3.14Ω/□ for SHI irradiated sample at a fluence of 5E12 ions/cm2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies of both pristine and irradiated samples reveal that the middle layer is in metallic form and maintains its continuity even after ion irradiation.

Abstract: Film-based photovoltaic modules employ monolithic interconnects to minimize resistance loss and enhance module voltage via series connection. Conventional interconnect construction occurs sequentially, with a scribing step following deposition of the bottom electrode, a second scribe after deposition of absorber and intermediate layers, and a third following deposition of the top electrode. This method produces interconnect widths of about 300µm, and the area comprised by interconnects within a module (generally about 3%) does not contribute to power generation. The present work reports on an increasingly popular strategy capable of reducing the interconnect width to less than 100µm: printing interconnects. Cost modeling projects a savings of about $0.02/watt for CdTe module production through the use of printed interconnects, with savings coming from both reduced capital expense and increased module power output. Printed interconnect demonstrations with copper-indium-gallium-diselenide and cadmium-telluride solar cells show successful voltage addition and miniaturization down to 250µm. Material selection guidelines and considerations for commercialization are discussed.

Abstract: In this work we perform comprehensive characterization on a 6.9% pure sulphide Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) device and construct a 2D device model in Sentaurus TCAD to identify possible roots of performance bottlenecks. Electrical and optical parameters of the absorber from comprehensive electrical and optical characterization, together with other necessary parameters from literature, we successfully reproduce measured current density-voltage (J-V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves. Absorption coefficient is extracted by fitting measured internal quantum efficiency (IQE). At the buffer/absorber interface, a surface recombination velocity of 1×105cm/s is identified to adequately describe measured spectral response at the near-interface region. Furthermore, a bulk lifetime of ~29ns is extracted from effective lifetime modelling in conjunction with time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results. The key underlying Voc deficit, ~200mV, is pinpointed to bandgap fluctuation, which is backed by the simulation study on both QE tail and steady state photoluminescence.

Abstract: Aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1) is a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of various aldehydes. Certain types of epithelial tissues in mammals, especially those continually exposed to environmental stress (e.g., corneal epithelium), express ALDH3A1 at high levels and its abundance in such tissues is perceived to help to maintain cellular homeostasis under conditions of oxidative stress. Metabolic as well as non-metabolic roles for ALDH3A1 have been associated with its mediated resistance to cellular oxidative stress. In this study, we provide evidence that ALDH3A1 exhibits molecular chaperone-like activity further supporting its multifunctional role. Specifically, we expressed and purified the human ALDH3A1 in E. coli and used the recombinant protein to investigate its in vitro ability to protect SmaI and citrate synthase (from precipitation and/or deactivation) under thermal stress conditions. Our results indicate that recombinant ALDH3A1 exhibits significant chaperone function in vitro. Furthermore, over-expression of the fused histidine-tagged ALDH3A1 confers host E. coli cells with enhanced resistance to thermal shock, while ALDH3A1 over-expression in the human corneal cell line HCE-2 was sufficient for protecting them from the cytotoxic effects of both hydrogen peroxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide. These results further support the chaperone-like function of human ALDH3A1. Taken together, ALDH3A1, in addition to its primary metabolic role in fundamental cellular detoxification processes, appears to play an essential role in protecting cellular proteins against aggregation under stress conditions.

Depending on the closely and continuous arrangement of large perovskite crystals in the film, a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.01% was achieved along with a photocurrent density of 21.32mA/cm2, an open circuit voltage of 1.07V and a fill factor of 0.70 from the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells with p-i-n structure. Even more exciting was the quite good stability of the hot-casting-based device, which remained at more than 91% under 55% humidity for 10 days.

Abstract: The precise role of interleukin (IL)-10 in breast cancer is not clear. Previous studies suggested a tumor-promoting role of IL-10 in breast cancer, whereas recent discoveries that IL-10 activated and expanded tumor-resident CD8+ T cells challenged the traditional view. Here, we investigated the role of IL-10 in HLA-A2-positive breast cancer patients with Grade III, Stage IIA or IIB in-situ and invasive ductal carcinoma, and compared it with that of IL-2, the canonical CD8+ T cell growth factor. We first observed that breast cancer patients presented higher serum levels of IL-2 and IL-10 than healthy controls. Upon prolonged TCR stimulation, peripheral blood CD8+ T cells from breast cancer patients tended to undergo apoptosis, which could be prevented by the addition of IL-2 and/or IL-10. The cytotoxicity of TCR-activated CD8+ T cells was also enhanced by exogenous IL-2 and/or IL-10. Interestingly, IL-2 and IL-10 demonstrated synergistic effects, since the enhancement in CD8+ T cell function when both cytokines were added was greater than the sum of the improvements mediated by each individual cytokine. IL-10 by itself could not promote the proliferation of CD8+ T cells but could significantly enhance IL-2-mediated promotion of CD8+ T cell proliferation. In addition, the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in breast tumor was elevated when both IL-2 and IL-10 were present but not when either one was absent. This synergistic effect was stopped by CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg), which depleted IL-2 in a cell number-dependent manner. Together, these results demonstrated that IL-2 and IL-10 could work synergistically to improve the survival, proliferation, and cytotoxicity of activated CD8+ T cells, an effect suppressible by CD4+CD25+ Treg cells.

Abstract: Homeobox (HOX) genes are conserved transcription factors which determine the anterior-posterior body axis patterning. HOXD8 is a member of HOX genes deregulated in several tumors such as lung carcinoma, neuroblastoma, glioma and colorectal cancer (CRC) in a context-dependent manner. In CRC, HOXD8 is downregulated in cancer tissues and metastatic foci as compared to normal tissues. Whether HOXD8 acts as a tumor suppressor of malignant progression and metastasis is still unclear. Also, the underlying mechanism of its function including the downstream targets is totally unknown. Here, we clarified the lower expression of HOXD8 in clinical colorectal cancer vs. normal colon tissues. Also, we showed that stable expression of HOXD8 in colorectal cancer cells significantly reduced the cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and invasion. Further, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified the genes associated with HOXD8 in order to demonstrate its function as a suppressor or a promoter of colorectal carcinoma. Among inversely related genes, apoptotic inhibitors like STK38 kinase and MYC were shown to be negatively associated with HOXD8. We demonstrated the ability of HOXD8 to upregulate executioner caspases 6 & 7 and cleaved PARP, thus inducing the apoptotic events in colorectal cancer cells.

Abstract: Background
Bacillus anthracis (BA) is a major bioterrorism concern which has evolved complex regulatory mechanisms for its virulence factors. Secreted proteases play an imperative role in the pathogenesis of BA, however their regulation remains elusive. Two component systems (TCS) are often employed by bacteria to sense and adapt to the environmental perturbations. In several pathogens, TCS are commonly associated with the regulation of virulence factors including proteases. The genome of BA encodes 41 TCS pairs, however, the role of any TCS in regulation of its proteases is not known.
Principal findings
The study established BAS2108-2109 as a prototypical TCS where BAS2108 functions as a histidine kinase and BAS2109 as the response regulator. The expression of BAS2109 was found to be elevated under host simulated conditions and in pellicle forming cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and lacZ reporter assay revealed positive autoregulation of the BAS2108-2109 operon by BAS2109. Collective analysis of ANS assay and EMSA demonstrated Lys167, Thr179 and Thr182 residues are crucial for the DNA binding activity of BAS2109. EMSA analysis further highlighted BAS2109 as the transcriptional regulator for different genes of BA, particularly proteases. Upregulation of proteases in BA overexpressing BAS2109 further strengthen its role in protease regulation.
Significance
This is the first report to identify a TCS pair for its role in the regulation of proteases of BA. Importance of proteases in the pathogenesis of BA is well documented, therefore, studying the regulatory networks governing their expression will help in identification of new drug targets.

Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of the optical properties of different surface textures for silicon solar cells must include (i) the optical performance at cell level as well as encapsulated to a module stack and (ii) a varying angle of incidence of the solar irradiation, as it influences the optical yield. Within this work, the OPTOS formalism (Optical Properties of Textured Optical Sheets) was used to compare a honeycomb texture featuring a high aspect ratio with state of the art random pyramids and the isotexture. The honeycomb texture exhibits an increased absorbed photocurrent density of 2.3mA/cm2 before and 0.7mA/cm2 after encapsulation compared to the isotexture for a 180µm thick solar cell. The simulated absolute value of 42.3mA/cm2 after encapsulation is even superior to the random pyramid texture with 41.5mA/cm2. Furthermore, a simulation-based optical yield analysis reveals that the angular irradiance of three exemplary terrestrial locations plays a minor role for the relative performance between the textures compared to influence of encapsulation effects.

Abstract: Genetic and laboratory experiments have brought remarkable advances in management of human malignancies, which not only revolutionized the understanding of the disease, but also led to development of novel and effective targeted therapies against specific deregulated pathways. This study aimed to investigate anti-cancer effects of Idelalisib, a potent PI3K-δ inhibitor, in a panel of hematological cell lines. The resulting data showed that Idelalisib decreased cell survival in all the tested cell lines; however, as compared to NB4, viability of other cell lines, irrespective of their molecular characteristics or even the compensatory activation of MEK/ERK pathway, was inhibited at higher concentrations. This study suggests for the first time that there is a significant correlation between relative response to Idelalisib and basal expression levels of anti-apoptotic genes, in particular survivin and MCL-1. Intriguingly, we found that Idelalisib-induced apoptosis in NB4, as the most sensitive cell line with the lowest expression level of the aforementioned genes, is executed probably via alteration in the transcriptional level of apoptosis-related genes coupled with p21-mediated caspase-3 activation. Moreover, the lower concentrations of Idelalisib combined with arsenic trioxide (ATO) produced synergistic anti-cancer effect in APL-derived NB4 cells. Overall, due to the pharmacologic safety of Idelalisib and its broad clinical effectiveness in chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, our study suggests that this inhibitor is a promising agent for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, either as single agent or in a combined-modality strategy.
