Abstract: Summary
Distinguishing between conserved and divergent regulatory mechanisms is essential for translating preclinical research from mice to humans, yet there is a lack of information about how evolutionary genome rearrangements affect the regulation of the immune response, a rapidly evolving system. The current model is topologically associating domains (TADs) are conserved between species, buffering evolutionary rearrangements and conserving long-range interactions within a TAD. However, we find that TADs frequently span evolutionary translocation and inversion breakpoints near genes with species-specific expression in immune cells, creating unique enhancer-promoter interactions exclusive to the mouse or human genomes. This includes TADs encompassing immune-related transcription factors, cytokines, and receptors. For example, we uncover an evolutionary rearrangement that created a shared LPS-inducible regulatory module between OASL and P2RX7 in human macrophages that is absent in mice. Therefore, evolutionary genome rearrangements disrupt TAD boundaries, enabling sequence-conserved enhancer elements from divergent genomic locations between species to create unique regulatory modules.

Abstract: Summary
In mature B cells, TACI controls class-switch recombination and differentiation into plasma cells during T cell-independent antibody responses. TACI binds the ligands BAFF and APRIL. Approximately 10% of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) carry TACI mutations, of which A181E and C172Y are in the transmembrane domain. Residues A181 and C172 are located on distinct sides of the transmembrane helix, which is predicted by molecular modeling to spontaneously assemble into trimers and dimers. In human B cells, these mutations impair ligand-dependent (C172Y) and -independent (A181E) TACI multimerization and signaling, as well as TACI-enhanced proliferation and/or IgA production. Genetic inactivation of TACI in primary human B cells impaired survival of CpG-activated cells in the absence of ligand. These results identify the transmembrane region of TACI as an active interface for TACI multimerization in signal transduction, in particular for ligand-independent signals. These functions are perturbed by CVID-associated mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cell (Treg) lymphatic migration is required for resolving inflammation and prolonging allograft survival. Focusing on Treg interactions with lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), we dissect mechanisms and functional consequences of Treg transendothelial migration (TEM). Using three genetic mouse models of pancreatic islet transplantation, we show that Treg lymphotoxin (LT) αβ and LEC LTβ receptor (LTβR) signaling are required for efficient Treg migration and suppressive function to prolong allograft survival. Inhibition of LT signaling increases Treg conversion to Foxp3loCD25lo exTregs. In a transwell-based model of TEM across polarized LECs, non-migrated Tregs become exTregs. Such conversion is regulated by LTβR nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling in LECs, which increases interleukin-6 (IL-6) production and drives exTreg conversion. Migrating Tregs are ectonucleotidase CD39hi and resist exTreg conversion in an adenosine-receptor-2A-dependent fashion. Human Tregs migrating across human LECs behave similarly. These molecular interactions can be targeted for therapeutic manipulation of immunity and suppression.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic program is altered during macrophage activation and influences macrophage polarization. Glutaminolysis promotes accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (αKG), leading to Jumonji domain-containing protein D3 (Jmjd3)-dependent demethylation at H3K27me3 during M2 polarization of macrophages. However, it remains unclear how αKG accumulation is regulated during M2 polarization of macrophages. This study shows that SENP1-Sirt3 signaling controls glutaminolysis, leading to αKG accumulation during IL-4-stimulated M2 polarization. Activation of the SENP1-Sirt3 axis augments M2 macrophage polarization through the accumulation of αKG via glutaminolysis. We also identify glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1) as an acetylated protein in mitochondria. The SENP1-Sirt3 axis deacetylates GLUD1 and increases its activity in glutaminolysis to promote αKG production, leading to M2 polarization of macrophages. Therefore, SENP1-Sirt3 signaling plays a critical role in αKG accumulation via glutaminolysis to promote M2 polarization.

Abstract: Both matrix stiffening and remodeling of calcium signaling occur in breast cancers, with downstream consequences linked to the progression of the disease. However, the potential intersection between calcium signaling and matrix stiffness has not been fully assessed in models of cancer. Here, we describe the assessment of calcium signaling in breast cancer cells at high and low matrix stiffness using novel gel culture models (gelatin methacryloyl and polydimethylsiloxane) and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells expressing the calcium sensor GCaMP6m. Remodeling of ATP-stimulated cytosolic calcium responses in cells on different matrices was assessed using a high throughput fluorescence imaging plate reader. Our data reveal that matrices of higher stiffness attenuate ATP-induced sustained calcium influx in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. This matrix-mediated attenuation of sustained calcium influx was dependent on the store-operated calcium channel component ORAI1. These studies suggest that calcium signaling in breast cancer cells can be altered as a consequence of matrix stiffness; modulation of such pathways may represent a new mechanism to target calcium signaling to regulate tumor progression in breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Argonautes are nucleic acid-guided proteins that perform numerous cellular functions across all domains of life. Little is known about how distinct evolutionary pressures have shaped each Argonaute’s biophysical properties. We applied high-throughput biochemistry to characterize how Thermus thermophilus Argonaute (TtAgo), a DNA-guided DNA endonuclease, finds, binds, and cleaves its targets. We found that TtAgo uses biophysical adaptations similar to those of eukaryotic Argonautes for rapid association but requires more extensive complementarity to achieve high-affinity target binding. Using these data, we constructed models for TtAgo association rates and equilibrium binding affinities that estimate the nucleic acid- and protein-mediated components of the target interaction energies. Finally, we showed that TtAgo cleavage rates vary widely based on the DNA guide, suggesting that only a subset of guides cleaves targets on physiologically relevant timescales.

Abstract: Summary
γ-oscillatory activity is ubiquitous across brain areas. Numerous studies have suggested that γ-synchrony is likely to enhance the transmission of sensory information. However, direct causal evidence is still lacking. Here, we test this hypothesis in the mouse olfactory system, where local GABAergic granule cells (GCs) in the olfactory bulb shape mitral/tufted cell (MTC) excitatory output from the olfactory bulb. By optogenetically modulating GC activity, we successfully dissociate MTC γ-synchronization from its firing rates. Recording of odor responses in downstream piriform cortex neurons shows that increasing MTC γ-synchronization enhances cortical neuron odor-evoked firing rates, reduces response variability, and improves odor ensemble representation. These gains occur despite a reduction in MTC firing rates. Furthermore, reducing MTC γ-synchronization without changing the MTC firing rates, by suppressing GC activity, degrades piriform cortex odor-evoked responses. These findings provide causal evidence that increased γ-synchronization enhances the transmission of sensory information between two brain regions.

Abstract: Summary
Circular RNAs are garnering increasing interest as potential regulatory RNAs and a format for gene expression. The characterization of circular RNA using analytical techniques commonly employed in the literature, such as gel electrophoresis, can, under differing conditions, yield different results when attempting to distinguish circular RNA from linear RNA of similar molecular weights. Here, we describe circular RNA migration in different conditions, analyzed by gel electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We characterize key parameters that affect the migration pattern of circular RNA in gel electrophoresis systems, which include gel type, electrophoresis time, sample buffer composition, and voltage. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of orthogonal analytical tests for circular RNA that take advantage of its covalently closed structure to further distinguish circular RNA from linear RNA following in vitro synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is connected to immunotherapy responses, but it remains unclear how cancer cells and host tissues differentially influence the immune composition within TME. Here, we performed single-cell analyses for autologous samples from liver metastasized colorectal cancer to disentangle factors shaping TME. By aligning CD45+ cells across different tissues, we classified exhausted CD8+ T cells (Texs) and activated regulatory T cells as M-type, whose phenotypes were associated with the malignancy, while natural killer and mucosal-associated invariant T cells were defined as N-type, whose phenotypes were associated with the niche. T cell receptor sharing between Texs in primary and metastatic tumors implicated the presence of common peripheral non-exhausted precursors. For myeloid cells, a subset of dendritic cells (DC3s) and SPP1+ macrophages were M-type, and the latter were predominant in liver metastasis, indicating its pro-metastasis role. Our analyses bridge immune phenotypes of primary and metastatic tumors, thereby helping to understand the tumor-specific contexture and identify the pro-metastasis components.

Abstract: Summary
Retroviral integration is mediated by a unique enzymatic process shared by all retroviruses and retrotransposons. During integration, double-stranded linear viral DNA is inserted into the host genome in a process catalyzed by viral-encoded integrase (IN). However, host cell defenses against HIV-1 integration are not clear. This study identifies β-catenin-like protein 1 (CTNNBL1) as a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 integration via association with viral-encoded integrase (IN) and its cofactor, lens epithelium-derived growth factor/p75. CTNNBL1 overexpression blocks HIV-1 integration and inhibits viral replication, whereas CTNNBL1 depletion significantly upregulates HIV-1 integration into the genome of various target cells. Further, CTNNBL1 expression is downregulated in CD4+ T cells by activation, and CTNNBL1 depletion also facilitates HIV-1 integration in resting CD4+ T cells. Thus, host cells may employ CTNNBL1 to inhibit HIV-1 integration into the genome. This finding suggests a strategy for the treatment of HIV infections.

Abstract: Summary
The appearance of trophectoderm (TE) is a hallmark event in preimplantation development during murine embryogenesis. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying TE specification. We find that the depletion of Rif1 breaks down the barrier to the transition from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). Rif1-null-induced TSCs show typical TE properties and the potential to differentiate into terminal trophoblast lineages. Global transcriptome analysis reveal that Rif1 deletion activates 2-cell embryo (2C)-related genes and induces a totipotent-like state. Chimeric assays further confirm that Rif1-null ESCs contribute to the functional placenta in addition to the fetus on embryonic day 12.5. Furthermore, we show overexpression of Hmgn3, one of the key upregulated gene in Rif1-null ESCs, facilitates the induction of TSCs. Therefore, we report two key genes regulating the conversion of TSCs and provide insights for investigating TE specification.

Abstract: Summary
Innate immune responses induce hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Viperin, a member of the radical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) superfamily of enzymes, is the product of one such ISG that restricts the replication of a broad spectrum of viruses. Here, we report a previously unknown antiviral mechanism in which viperin activates a ribosome collision-dependent pathway that inhibits both cellular and viral RNA translation. We found that the radical SAM activity of viperin is required for translation inhibition and that this is mediated by viperin’s enzymatic product, 3′-deoxy-3′,4′-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP). Viperin triggers ribosome collisions and activates the MAPKKK ZAK pathway that in turn activates the GCN2 arm of the integrated stress response pathway to inhibit translation. The study illustrates the importance of translational repression in the antiviral response and identifies viperin as a translation regulator in innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The homunculus in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is famous for its body part selectivity, but this dominant feature may eclipse other representational features, e.g., information content, also relevant for S1 organization. Using multivariate fMRI analysis, we ask whether body part information content can be identified in S1 beyond its primary region. Throughout S1, we identify significant representational dissimilarities between body parts but also subparts in distant non-primary regions (e.g., between the hand and the lips in the foot region and between different face parts in the foot region). Two movements performed by one body part (e.g., the hand) could also be dissociated well beyond its primary region (e.g., in the foot and face regions), even within Brodmann area 3b. Our results demonstrate that information content is more distributed across S1 than selectivity maps suggest. This finding reveals underlying information contents in S1 that could be harnessed for rehabilitation and brain-machine interfaces.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the NF1 gene cause the familial genetic disease neurofibromatosis type I, as well as predisposition to cancer. The NF1 gene product, neurofibromin, is a GTPase-activating protein and acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the small GTPase, Ras. However, structural insights into neurofibromin activation remain incompletely defined. Here, we provide cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures that reveal an extended neurofibromin homodimer in two functional states: an auto-inhibited state with occluded Ras-binding site and an asymmetric open state with an exposed Ras-binding site. Mechanistically, the transition to the active conformation is stimulated by nucleotide binding, which releases a lock that tethers the catalytic domain to an extended helical repeat scaffold in the occluded state. Structure-guided mutational analysis supports functional relevance of allosteric control. Disease-causing mutations are mapped and primarily impact neurofibromin stability. Our findings suggest a role for nucleotides in neurofibromin regulation and may lead to therapeutic modulation of Ras signaling.

Abstract: Although microRNAs (miRNAs) exert an important role in the osteogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the effect of miR-381-3p on the osteogenic differentiation in MBD‑MSCs is still unclear. The BMMSCs from patients with MBD (MBD‑MSC) or normal participants (Normal‑MSC) were isolated and induced to differentiation with dexamethasone. BMMSCs were transfected with miR-381-3p mimic, miR-381-3p inhibitor, and FGF7 siRNA to regulate the expression of miR-381-3p or FGF7. The direct binding between miR-381-3p and FGF7 was predicted and confirmed by bioinformatics prediction and luciferase reporter assay. The effect of miR-381-3p on the osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs was assessed by RT‑qPCR, alizarin Red S staining and western blot assays. Isolated BMMSCs showed the regular morphology, and were positive for CD44, CD90 and CD105 but negative for CD34 and CD45 markers. The calcium deposition and the relative mRNA expression levels of ALP, OC and OPN after induction were markedly enhanced. MiR-381-3p was upregulated in BMMSCs. Also, inhibition of miR-381-3p notably promoted osteogenic differentiation, vice versa. Besides, miR-381-3p could directly target FGF7 and negatively modulate the expression of FGF7. Moreover, inhibition of FGF7 attenuated the increase of the calcium deposition, and the relative mRNA expression of ALP, OC and OPN caused by the downregulation of miR-381-3p. In addition, the miR-381-3p inhibitor-induced the enhancement of the relative protein expressions of FGFR2, p-MEK and p-ERK1/2 were significantly reduced by the co-transfection of si-FGF7. Furthermore, the application of LY3214996, the inhibitor of ERK also verified these outcomes. MiR-381-3p directly targeting FGF7 modulated the osteogenic differentiation via MEK/ERK signaling pathway in BMMSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Cilia are important for the interaction with environments and the proper function of tissues. While the basic structure of cilia is well conserved, ciliated cells have various functions. To understand the distinctive identities of ciliated cells, the identification of cell-specific proteins and its regulation is essential. Here, we report the mechanism that confers a specific identity on IL2 neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans, neurons important for the dauer larva-specific nictation behavior. We show that DAF-19M, an isoform of the sole C. elegans RFX transcription factor DAF-19, heads a regulatory subroutine, regulating target genes through an X-box motif variant under the control of terminal selector proteins UNC-86 and CFI-1 in IL2 neurons. Considering the conservation of DAF-19M module in IL2 neurons for nictation and in male-specific neurons for mating behavior, we propose the existence of an evolutionarily adaptable, hard-wired genetic module for distinct behaviors that share the feature “recognizing the environment.”

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence indicates that the accretion of senescent cells is linked to metabolic disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms and metabolic consequences of cellular senescence in obesity remain obscure. In this study, we found that obese adipocytes are senescence-susceptible cells accompanied with genome instability. Additionally, we discovered that SREBP1c may play a key role in genome stability and senescence in adipocytes by modulating DNA-damage responses. Unexpectedly, SREBP1c interacted with PARP1 and potentiated PARP1 activity during DNA repair, independent of its canonical lipogenic function. The genetic depletion of SREBP1c accelerated adipocyte senescence, leading to immune cell recruitment into obese adipose tissue. These deleterious effects provoked unhealthy adipose tissue remodeling and insulin resistance in obesity. In contrast, the elimination of senescent adipocytes alleviated adipose tissue inflammation and improved insulin resistance. These findings revealed distinctive roles of SREBP1c-PARP1 axis in the regulation of adipocyte senescence and will help decipher the metabolic significance of senescence in obesity.

Abstract: Background
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) belongs to non-small cell lung carcinoma, and the metastasis is the main cause of death in LUAD patients. It is generally accepted that cell adhesion is closely associated with tumor metastasis. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to investigate the functions of CLEC3B to the invasion, adhesion, and migration of LUAD cells.

Through bioinformatic analysis, CLEC3B level was found markedly down-regulated in LUAD tissue. Parallel-plate flow chamber, wound-healing and Transwell assays were taken to detect the cell adhesion, invasion, and migration. qRT-PCR and western blot analyzed expression of CLEC3B, p53 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker.
Results
When CLEC3B was lowly-expressed in LUAD cell lines, the cell adhesion capability was also lowered, with the EMT, migration and invasion of the cells progressed. Abnormal expression of CLEC3B was related to p53 signaling pathway.
Conclusion
Above all, a further investigation of the function of CLEC3B in LUAD helps us further understand the molecular mechanism of the tumor metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Upon extensive hepatocyte loss or impaired hepatocyte proliferation, liver regeneration occurs via biliary epithelial cell (BEC) transdifferentiation, which includes dedifferentiation of BECs into bipotential progenitor cells (BP-PCs) and then redifferentiation of BP-PCs to nascent hepatocytes and BECs. This BEC-driven liver regeneration involves reactivation of hepatoblast markers, but the underpinning mechanisms and their effects on liver regeneration remain largely unknown. Using a zebrafish extensive hepatocyte ablation model, we perform an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) forward genetic screen and identify a liver regeneration mutant, liver logan (lvl), in which the telomere maintenance 2 (tel2) gene is mutated. During liver regeneration, the tel2 mutation specifically inhibits transcriptional activation of a hepatoblast marker, hematopoietically expressed homeobox (hhex), in BEC-derived cells, which blocks BP-PC redifferentiation. Mechanistic studies show that Tel2 associates with the hhex promoter region and promotes hhex transcription. Our results reveal roles of Tel2 in the BP-PC redifferentiation process of liver regeneration by activating hhex.

Abstract: Summary
RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated transcription in metazoans requires precise regulation. RNA Pol II-associated protein 2 (RPAP2) was previously identified to transport Pol II from cytoplasm to nucleus and dephosphorylates Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD). Here, we show that RPAP2 binds hypo-/hyper-phosphorylated Pol II with undetectable phosphatase activity. The structure of RPAP2-Pol II shows mutually exclusive assembly of RPAP2-Pol II and pre-initiation complex (PIC) due to three steric clashes. RPAP2 prevents and disrupts Pol II-TFIIF interaction and impairs in vitro transcription initiation, suggesting a function in inhibiting PIC assembly. Loss of RPAP2 in cells leads to global accumulation of TFIIF and Pol II at promoters, indicating a critical role of RPAP2 in inhibiting PIC assembly independent of its putative phosphatase activity. Our study indicates that RPAP2 functions as a gatekeeper to inhibit PIC assembly and transcription initiation and suggests a transcription checkpoint.

Abstract: Summary
How metastatic cells arise is unclear. Here, we search for the induction of recently characterized pro-metastatic states as a surrogate for the origin of metastasis. Since cell-death-inducing therapies can paradoxically promote metastasis, we ask if such treatments induce pro-metastatic states in human colon cancer cells. We find that post-near-death cells acquire pro-metastatic states (PAMEs) and form distant metastases in vivo. These PAME (“let's go” in Greek) cells exhibit a multifactorial cytokine storm as well as signs of enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and nuclear reprogramming, requiring CXCL8, INSL4, IL32, PERK-CHOP, and NANOG. PAMEs induce neighboring tumor cells to become PAME-induced migratory cells (PIMs): highly migratory cells that re-enact the storm and enhance PAME migration. Metastases are thus proposed to originate from the induction of pro-metastatic states through intrinsic and extrinsic cues in a pro-metastatic tumoral ecosystem, driven by an impending cell-death experience involving ER stress modulation, metastatic reprogramming, and paracrine recruitment via a cytokine storm.

Abstract: Summary
A growing number of studies support a direct role for nuclear mTOR in gene regulation and chromatin structure. Still, the scarcity of known chromatin-bound mTOR partners limits our understanding of how nuclear mTOR controls transcription. Herein, comprehensive mapping of the mTOR chromatin-bound interactome in both androgen-dependent and -independent cellular models of prostate cancer (PCa) identifies a conserved 67-protein interaction network enriched for chromatin modifiers, transcription factors, and SUMOylation machinery. SUMO2/3 and nuclear pore protein NUP210 are among the strongest interactors, while the androgen receptor (AR) is the dominant androgen-inducible mTOR partner. Further investigation reveals that NUP210 facilitates mTOR nuclear trafficking, that mTOR and AR form a functional transcriptional module with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, and that androgens specify mTOR-SUMO2/3 promoter-enhancer association. This work identifies a vast network of mTOR-associated nuclear complexes advocating innovative molecular strategies to modulate mTOR-dependent gene regulation with conceivable implications for PCa and other diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Mutational signatures defined by single base substitution (SBS) patterns in cancer have elucidated potential mutagenic processes that contribute to malignancy. Two prevalent mutational patterns in human cancers are attributed to the APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase enzymes. Among the seven human APOBEC3 proteins, APOBEC3A is a potent deaminase and proposed driver of cancer mutagenesis. In this study, we prospectively examine genome-wide aberrations by expressing human APOBEC3A in avian DT40 cells. From whole-genome sequencing, we detect hundreds to thousands of base substitutions per genome. The APOBEC3A signature includes widespread cytidine mutations and a unique insertion-deletion (indel) signature consisting largely of cytidine deletions. This multi-dimensional APOBEC3A signature is prevalent in human cancer genomes. Our data further reveal replication-associated mutations, the rate of stem-loop and clustered mutations, and deamination of methylated cytidines. This comprehensive signature of APOBEC3A mutagenesis is a tool for future studies and a potential biomarker for APOBEC3 activity in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The functions of the human brain are metabolically expensive and reliant on coupling between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neural activity, yet how this coupling evolves over development remains unexplored. Here, we examine the relationship between CBF, measured by arterial spin labeling, and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) from resting-state magnetic resonance imaging across a sample of 831 children (478 females, aged 8–22 years) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. We first use locally weighted regressions on the cortical surface to quantify CBF-ALFF coupling. We relate coupling to age, sex, and executive functioning with generalized additive models and assess network enrichment via spin testing. We demonstrate regionally specific changes in coupling over age and show that variations in coupling are related to biological sex and executive function. Our results highlight the importance of CBF-ALFF coupling throughout development; we discuss its potential as a future target for the study of neuropsychiatric diseases.

Abstract: Summary
During Drosophila melanogaster male germline stem cell (GSC) asymmetric division, preexisting old versus newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 are asymmetrically inherited. However, the biological outcomes of this phenomenon have remained unclear. Here, we tracked old and new histones throughout the GSC cell cycle through the use of high spatial and temporal resolution microscopy. We found unique features that differ between old and new histone-enriched sister chromatids, including differences in nucleosome density, chromosomal condensation, and H3 Ser10 phosphorylation. These distinct chromosomal features lead to their differential association with Cdc6, a pre-replication complex component, and subsequent asynchronous DNA replication initiation in the resulting daughter cells. Disruption of asymmetric histone inheritance abolishes differential Cdc6 association and asynchronous S-phase entry, demonstrating that histone asymmetry acts upstream of these critical cell-cycle progression events. Furthermore, disruption of these GSC-specific chromatin features leads to GSC defects, indicating a connection between histone inheritance, cell-cycle progression, and cell fate determination.

Abstract: Summary
Marine planktonic eukaryotes play critical roles in global biogeochemical cycles and climate. However, their poor representation in culture collections limits our understanding of the evolutionary history and genomic underpinnings of planktonic ecosystems. Here, we used 280 billion Tara Oceans metagenomic reads from polar, temperate, and tropical sunlit oceans to reconstruct and manually curate more than 700 abundant and widespread eukaryotic environmental genomes ranging from 10 Mbp to 1.3 Gbp. This genomic resource covers a wide range of poorly characterized eukaryotic lineages that complement long-standing contributions from culture collections while better representing plankton in the upper layer of the oceans. We performed the first, to our knowledge, comprehensive genome-wide functional classification of abundant unicellular eukaryotic plankton, revealing four major groups connecting distantly related lineages. Neither trophic modes of plankton nor its vertical evolutionary history could completely explain the functional repertoire convergence of major eukaryotic lineages that coexisted within oceanic currents for millions of years.

Abstract: Summary
Astrocytes play critical roles in brain development and disease, but the mechanisms that regulate astrocyte proliferation are poorly understood. We report that astrocyte proliferation is bi-directionally regulated by neuronal activity via NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling in neurons. Prolonged treatment with an NMDAR antagonist reduced expression of cell-cycle-related genes in astrocytes in hippocampal cultures and suppressed astrocyte proliferation in vitro and in vivo, whereas neuronal activation promoted astrocyte proliferation, dependent on neuronal NMDARs. Expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2) is induced specifically in neurons by NMDAR activation and is required for activity-dependent astrocyte proliferation through its product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). NMDAR inhibition or Ptgs2 genetic ablation in mice reduced the proliferation of astrocytes and microglia induced by mild traumatic brain injury in the absence of secondary excitotoxicity-induced neuronal death. Our study defines an NMDAR-mediated signaling mechanism that allows trans-cellular control of glial proliferation by neurons in brain development and injury.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) negatively impacts quality of life in the elderly population. The prevalent cause of ARHL is loss of mechanosensitive cochlear hair cells (HCs). The molecular and cellular mechanisms of HC degeneration remain poorly understood. Using RNA-seq transcriptomic analyses of inner and outer HCs isolated from young and aged mice, we show that HC aging is associated with changes in key molecular processes, including transcription, DNA damage, autophagy, and oxidative stress, as well as genes related to HC specialization. At the cellular level, HC aging is characterized by loss of stereocilia, shrinkage of HC soma, and reduction in outer HC mechanical properties, suggesting that functional decline in mechanotransduction and cochlear amplification precedes HC loss and contributes to ARHL. Our study reveals molecular and cytological profiles of aging HCs and identifies genes such as Sod1, Sirt6, Jund, and Cbx3 as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for ameliorating ARHL.

Abstract: Summary
Introspection based on the integration of uncertain evidence is critical for acting upon abstract thinking and imagining future scenarios. However, it is unknown how confidence read-outs from multiple sources of different concepts are integrated, especially considering the relationships among the concepts. In this study, monkeys performed wagering based on an estimation of their performance in a preceding mnemonic decision. We found that the longer the response times for post-decision wagering, the more relieved the impairments having been caused by frontal disruption. This suggests the existence of a time-consuming compensatory metacognitive process. We found posterior inferior parietal lobe (pIPL) as its candidate, which was not coding the wagering per se (i.e., just high bet or low bet), but became more active when monkeys successfully chose the optimal bet option based on mnemonic decision performance. Thereafter, the pIPL prompts dorsal anterior cingulate cortex to carry the chosen wagering option. Our findings suggest a role for the pIPL in metacognitive concept integration.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular temperature affects a wide range of cellular functions in living organisms. However, it remains unclear whether temperature in individual animal cells is controlled autonomously as a response to fluctuations in environmental temperature. Using two distinct intracellular thermometers, we find that the intracellular temperature of steady-state Drosophila S2 cells is maintained in a manner dependent on Δ9-fatty acid desaturase DESAT1, which introduces a double bond at the Δ9 position of the acyl moiety of acyl-CoA. The DESAT1-mediated increase of intracellular temperature is caused by the enhancement of F1Fo-ATPase-dependent mitochondrial respiration, which is coupled with thermogenesis. We also reveal that F1Fo-ATPase-dependent mitochondrial respiration is potentiated by cold exposure through the remodeling of mitochondrial cristae structures via DESAT1-dependent unsaturation of mitochondrial phospholipid acyl chains. Based on these findings, we propose a cell-autonomous mechanism for intracellular temperature control during environmental temperature changes.

Abstract: Summary
Factors released from glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs) play a crucial role in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) progression. Here, we study the importance of CCL18, a cytokine expressed in human but not in rodent GAMs, as a modulator of glioma growth. Since CCL18 signaling could not be studied in classical mouse glioma models, we developed an approach by transplanting induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human microglia and human glioma cells into mouse brain slices depleted of their intrinsic microglia. We observe that CCL18 promotes glioma cell growth and invasion. Chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 8 (CCR8) is identified as a functional receptor for CCL18 on glioma cells, and ACP5 (acid phosphatase 5) is revealed as an important part of the downstream signaling cascade for mediating glioma growth. We conclude, based on the results from an in vitro, ex vivo humanized glioma model and an in vivo GBM model that microglia/macrophage-derived CCL18 promotes glioma growth.

Abstract: Summary
The killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) recognizes human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules and modulates the function of natural killer cells. Despite its role in immunity, the complex genomic structure has limited a deep understanding of the KIR genomic landscape. Here we conduct deep sequencing of 16 KIR genes in 1,173 individuals. We devise a bioinformatics pipeline incorporating copy number estimation and insertion or deletion (indel) calling for high-resolution KIR genotyping. We define 118 alleles in 13 genes and demonstrate a linkage disequilibrium structure within and across KIR centromeric and telomeric regions. We construct a KIR imputation reference panel (nreference = 689, imputation accuracy = 99.7%), apply it to biobank genotype (ntotal = 169,907), and perform phenome-wide association studies of 85 traits. We observe a dearth of genome-wide significant associations, even in immune traits implicated previously to be associated with KIR (the smallest p = 1.5 × 10−4). Our pipeline presents a broadly applicable framework to evaluate innate immunity in large-scale datasets.

Abstract: The neuromuscular junction (NMJ), which is a synapse for signal transmission from motor neurons to muscle cells, has emerged as an important region because of its association with several peripheral neuropathies. In particular, mutations in GARS that affect the formation of NMJ result in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. These disorders are mainly considered to be caused by neuronal axon abnormalities; however, no treatment is currently available. Therefore, in order to determine whether the NMJ could be targeted to treat neurodegenerative disorders, we investigated the NMJ recovery effect of HDAC6 inhibitors, which have been used in the treatment of several peripheral neuropathies. In the present study, we demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibition was sufficient to enhance movement by restoring NMJ impairments observed in a zebrafish disease model. We found that CKD-504, a novel HDAC6 inhibitor, was effective in repairing NMJ defects, suggesting that treatment of neurodegenerative diseases via NMJ targeting is possible.

Abstract: Plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles are an emerging trend in plant biology. For the first time, we have isolated and characterized exosomes from Beta vulgaris extract (BEX). The antioxidant capacity, the nitrite, and total phenolic contents of BEX were determined. In vitro angiogenesis assay was used to measure the proangiogenic effects of BEX on endothelial cells. Furthermore, we examined the effects of BEX on migration and gene expression profiles of skin-derived fibroblasts. The anti-cancer effects of BEX were also investigated. The results indicated that BEX had antioxidative and scavenging properties. An increase in angiogenic potential was observed in endothelial cells treated with BEX. Furthermore, BEX treatment modulated the potential of fibroblasts to produce collagen 1/3 and hyaluronan synthase enzyme type 2. In addition, BEX treatment inhibited the migration abilities of fibroblasts. Nevertheless, BEX was not found to negatively affect the viability of cancerous cells at the dosage selected. In conclusion, this study identified novel properties of Beta vulgaris and its exosomes in the promotion of angiogenesis as well as antiaging and anti-scar capacities of fibroblasts. The findings suggest new cosmetic and therapeutic applications for Beta vulgaris.

Abstract: Summary
The product of hexokinase (HK) enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate, can be metabolized through glycolysis or directed to alternative metabolic routes, such as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to generate anabolic intermediates. HK1 contains an N-terminal mitochondrial binding domain (MBD), but its physiologic significance remains unclear. To elucidate the effect of HK1 mitochondrial dissociation on cellular metabolism, we generated mice lacking the HK1 MBD (ΔE1HK1). These mice produced a hyper-inflammatory response when challenged with lipopolysaccharide. Additionally, there was decreased glucose flux below the level of GAPDH and increased upstream flux through the PPP. The glycolytic block below GAPDH is mediated by the binding of cytosolic HK1 with S100A8/A9, resulting in GAPDH nitrosylation through iNOS. Additionally, human and mouse macrophages from conditions of low-grade inflammation, such as aging and diabetes, displayed increased cytosolic HK1 and reduced GAPDH activity. Our data indicate that HK1 mitochondrial binding alters glucose metabolism through regulation of GAPDH.

Abstract: Summary
Many neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), lead to the selective degeneration of discrete cell types in the CNS despite the ubiquitous expression of many genes linked to disease. Therapeutic advancement depends on understanding the unique cellular adaptations that underlie pathology of vulnerable cells in the context of disease-causing mutations. Here, we employ bacTRAP molecular profiling to elucidate cell type-specific molecular responses of cortical upper motor neurons in a preclinical ALS model. Using two bacTRAP mouse lines that label distinct vulnerable or resilient projection neuron populations in motor cortex, we show that the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (Oxphos) pathways is a common response in both cell types. However, differences in the baseline expression of genes involved in Stem and the handling of reactive oxygen species likely lead to the selective degeneration of the vulnerable cells. These results provide a framework to identify cell-type-specific processes in neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Summary
Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In this phase 3 study (ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT03829969), 514 patients with treatment-naïve advanced ESCC were randomized (1:1) to receive toripalimab or placebo in combination with paclitaxel plus cisplatin (TP) every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles, followed by toripalimab or placebo maintenance. At the prespecified final analysis of progression-free survival (PFS), a significant improvement in PFS is observed for the toripalimab arm over the placebo arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46–0.74; p < 0.0001). The prespecified interim analysis of overall survival (OS) also reveals a significant OS improvement for patients treated with toripalimab plus TP over placebo plus TP (HR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43–0.78; p = 0.0004). The incidences of grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events are similar between the two arms. Toripalimab plus TP significantly improves PFS and OS in patients with treatment-naïve, advanced ESCC, with a manageable safety profile.

Abstract: Summary
Blood vessel morphogenesis is driven by coordinated endothelial cell behaviors. Active remodeling of cell-cell junctions promotes cellular plasticity while preserving vascular integrity. Here, we analyze the dynamics of endothelial adherens junctions during lumen formation in angiogenic sprouts in vivo. Live imaging in zebrafish reveals that lumen expansion is accompanied by the formation of transient finger-shaped junctions. Junctional fingers are positively regulated by blood pressure, whereas flow inhibition prevents their formation. Using fluorescent reporters, we show that junctional fingers contain the mechanotransduction protein vinculin. Furthermore, genetic deletion of vinculin prevents finger formation, a junctional defect that could be rescued by transient endothelial expression of vinculin. Our findings suggest a mechanism whereby lumen expansion leads to an increase in junctional tension, triggering recruitment of vinculin and formation of junctional fingers. We propose that endothelial cells employ force-dependent junctional remodeling to counteract external forces in order to maintain vascular integrity during sprouting angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
ARID2 is the most recurrently mutated SWI/SNF complex member in melanoma; however, its tumor-suppressive mechanisms in the context of the chromatin landscape remain to be elucidated. Here, we model ARID2 deficiency in melanoma cells, which results in defective PBAF complex assembly with a concomitant genomic redistribution of the BAF complex. Upon ARID2 depletion, a subset of PBAF and shared BAF-PBAF-occupied regions displays diminished chromatin accessibility and associated gene expression, while BAF-occupied enhancers gain chromatin accessibility and expression of genes linked to the process of invasion. As a function of altered accessibility, the genomic occupancy of melanoma-relevant transcription factors is affected and significantly correlates with the observed transcriptional changes. We further demonstrate that ARID2-deficient cells acquire the ability to colonize distal organs in multiple animal models. Taken together, our results reveal a role for ARID2 in mediating BAF and PBAF subcomplex chromatin dynamics with consequences for melanoma metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T cells that recognize tumor antigens are required for immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy in murine models, but their contributions in human cancer are unclear. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor sequences to identify signatures and functional correlates of tumor-specific CD4+ T cells infiltrating human melanoma. Conventional CD4+ T cells that recognize tumor neoantigens express CXCL13 and are subdivided into clusters expressing memory and T follicular helper markers, and those expressing cytolytic markers, inhibitory receptors, and IFN-γ. The frequency of CXCL13+ CD4+ T cells in the tumor correlated with the transcriptional states of CD8+ T cells and macrophages, maturation of B cells, and patient survival. Similar correlations were observed in a breast cancer cohort. These results identify phenotypes and functional correlates of tumor-specific CD4+ T cells in melanoma and suggest the possibility of using such cells to modify the tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Caspases are evolutionarily conserved cysteine proteases that are essential for regulating cell death and are involved in multiple development and disease processes, including immunity. Here, we show that the bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS) effector CopC (Chromobacterium outer protein C) from the environmental pathogen Chromobacterium violaceum attacks caspase-3/-7/-8/-9 by ADPR-deacylization to dysregulate programmed cell death, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. This modification involves ADP-ribosylation- and deamination-mediated cyclization on Arg207 of caspase-3 by a mechanism that requires the eukaryote-specific protein calmodulin (CaM), leading to inhibition of caspase activity. The manipulation of cell death signaling by CopC is essential for the virulence of C. violaceum in a mouse infection model. CopC represents a family of enzymes existing in taxonomically diverse bacteria associated with a wide spectrum of eukaryotes ranging from humans to plants. The unique activity of CopC establishes a mechanism by which bacteria counteract host defenses through a previously unrecognized post-translational modification.

Abstract: Summary
Temporal patterning of neural progenitors is an evolutionarily conserved strategy for generating neuronal diversity. Type II neural stem cells in the Drosophila central brain produce transit-amplifying intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) that exhibit temporal patterning. However, the known temporal factors cannot account for the neuronal diversity in the adult brain. To search for missing factors, we developed NanoDam, which enables rapid genome-wide profiling of endogenously tagged proteins in vivo with a single genetic cross. Mapping the targets of known temporal transcription factors with NanoDam revealed that Homeobrain and Scarecrow (ARX and NKX2.1 orthologs) are also temporal factors. We show that Homeobrain and Scarecrow define middle-aged and late INP temporal windows and play a role in cellular longevity. Strikingly, Homeobrain and Scarecrow have conserved functions as temporal factors in the developing visual system. NanoDam enables rapid cell-type-specific genome-wide profiling with temporal resolution and is easily adapted for use in higher organisms.

Abstract: Summary
The precisionFDA Truth Challenge V2 aimed to assess the state of the art of variant calling in challenging genomic regions. Starting with FASTQs, 20 challenge participants applied their variant-calling pipelines and submitted 64 variant call sets for one or more sequencing technologies (Illumina, PacBio HiFi, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Submissions were evaluated following best practices for benchmarking small variants with updated Genome in a Bottle benchmark sets and genome stratifications. Challenge submissions included numerous innovative methods, with graph-based and machine learning methods scoring best for short-read and long-read datasets, respectively. With machine learning approaches, combining multiple sequencing technologies performed particularly well. Recent developments in sequencing and variant calling have enabled benchmarking variants in challenging genomic regions, paving the way for the identification of previously unknown clinically relevant variants.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of activated T cells. The switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis provides energy and intermediary metabolites for the biosynthesis of macromolecules to support clonal expansion and effector function. Here, we show that glycolytic reprogramming additionally controls inflammatory gene expression via epigenetic remodeling. We found that the glucose transporter GLUT3 is essential for the effector functions of Th17 cells in models of autoimmune colitis and encephalomyelitis. At the molecular level, we show that GLUT3-dependent glucose uptake controls a metabolic-transcriptional circuit that regulates the pathogenicity of Th17 cells. Metabolomic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic analyses linked GLUT3 to mitochondrial glucose oxidation and ACLY-dependent acetyl-CoA generation as a rate-limiting step in the epigenetic regulation of inflammatory gene expression. Our findings are also important from a translational perspective because inhibiting GLUT3-dependent acetyl-CoA generation is a promising metabolic checkpoint to mitigate Th17-cell-mediated inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: The development of three-dimensional (3D) in vitro model to recapitulate the in vivo tumor tissue is essential for studying tumor biology, discovering anti-cancer drugs, and evaluating anti-cancer drug efficacy. However, most of the previous models lack the involvement of vascular barrier. Here, we proposed an in vitro 3D cocultured tumor-vascular barrier model by the combination of alginate hydrogels beads and Transwell system. PC-3 cells and NIH/3T3 cells were encapsulated in alginate hydrogel beads, which were cultured in the bottom chamber of Transwell, while human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured on the porous membrane in the upper chamber to form vascular barrier. The effect of the concentration of alginate sodium on the morphology, diameter and swelling ratio of the beads was studied. The alginate sodium content and cell seeding density were further optimized according to cell proliferation ability. The formation of endothelial barrier was verified by immunostaining with tight junction protein VE-cadherin and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) monitoring. Finally, the drug response of 3D cocultured tumor-vascular barrier model to curcumin was evaluated. Compared with two-dimensional (2D) coculture model and 3D coculture spheroid model, 3D tumor-vascular barrier model showed the highest activity of cancer cells and the strongest drug resistance. The developed 3D cocultured tumor-vascular barrier model possesses great potential to be applied for in vitro evaluation of anti-tumor drugs.

Abstract: Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a growth factor that appears to play an important role in prostate cancer growth and angiogenesis. We have previously shown that decreased PTN expression in human prostate cancer PC3 cells leads to decreased adhesion of prostate cancer cells to osteoblasts, suggesting that PTN mediates this interaction. In the current work, using peptides that correspond to different regions of the PTN protein, we identified that a domain responsible for the adhesion of prostate cancer cells to osteoblasts corresponds to amino acids 16–24 of the mature PTN protein. Given that a synthetic PTN16–24 peptide which disturbs the interaction of PTN with nucleolin (NCL) was found to inhibit prostate cancer cells’ adhesion to osteoblasts, it seems that NCL mediates the cellular interactions involved in the adhesion process. Two pseudopeptides that bind to cell surface NCL and an anti-NCL antibody also decrease prostate cancer cell adhesion to osteoblasts to the same degree as PTN16–24, further supporting the involvement of cell surface NCL in this interaction. Collectively, our data suggest that NCL on the cell surface of osteoblasts may mediate adhesion of prostate cancer cells through PTN and identify peptides that could be exploited therapeutically to target this component of prostate cancer bone metastases.

Abstract: Summary
7SK non-coding RNA (7SK) negatively regulates RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) elongation by inhibiting positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), and its ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) is hijacked by HIV-1 for viral transcription and replication. Methylphosphate capping enzyme (MePCE) and La-related protein 7 (Larp7) constitutively associate with 7SK to form a core RNP, while P-TEFb and other proteins dynamically assemble to form different complexes. Here, we present the cryo-EM structures of 7SK core RNP formed with two 7SK conformations, circular and linear, and uncover a common RNA-dependent MePCE-Larp7 complex. Together with NMR, biochemical, and cellular data, these structures reveal the mechanism of MePCE catalytic inactivation in the core RNP, unexpected interactions between Larp7 and RNA that facilitate a role as an RNP chaperone, and that MePCE-7SK-Larp7 core RNP serves as a scaffold for switching between different 7SK conformations essential for RNP assembly and regulation of P-TEFb sequestration and release.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF or BAF) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes play critical roles in governing genomic architecture and gene expression and are frequently perturbed in human cancers. Transcription factors (TFs), including fusion oncoproteins, can bind to BAF complex surfaces to direct chromatin targeting and accessibility, often activating oncogenic gene loci. Here, we demonstrate that the FUS::DDIT3 fusion oncoprotein hallmark to myxoid liposarcoma (MLPS) inhibits BAF complex-mediated remodeling of adipogenic enhancer sites via sequestration of the adipogenic TF, CEBPB, from the genome. In mesenchymal stem cells, small-molecule inhibition of BAF complex ATPase activity attenuates adipogenesis via failure of BAF-mediated DNA accessibility and gene activation at CEBPB target sites. BAF chromatin occupancy and gene expression profiles of FUS::DDIT3-expressing cell lines and primary tumors exhibit similarity to SMARCB1-deficient tumor types. These data present a mechanism by which a fusion oncoprotein generates a BAF complex loss-of-function phenotype, independent of deleterious subunit mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Mobile microRNAs (miRNAs) serve as local and long-distance signals in the developmental patterning and stress responses in plants. However, mechanisms governing the non-cell autonomous activities of miRNAs remain elusive. Here, we show that mutations that disrupt microtubule dynamics are specifically defective for the non-cell autonomous actions of mobile miRNAs, including miR165/6 that is produced in the endodermis and moves to the vasculature to pattern xylem cell fates in Arabidopsis roots. We show that KTN1, a subunit of a microtubule-severing enzyme, is required in source cells to inhibit the loading of miR165/6 into ARGONUATE1 (AGO1), which is cell autonomous, to enable the miRNA to exit the cell. Microtubule disruption enhances the association of miR165/6 with AGO1 in the cytoplasm. These findings suggest that although cell-autonomous miRNAs load onto AGO1 in the nucleus, the cytoplasmic AGO1 loading of mobile miRNAs is a key step regulated by microtubules to promote the range of miRNA cell-to-cell movement.

Abstract: Summary
Ebola virus (EBOV) critically depends on the viral polymerase to replicate and transcribe the viral RNA genome in the cytoplasm of host cells, where cellular factors can antagonize or facilitate the virus life cycle. Here we leverage proximity proteomics and conduct a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to define the functional interactome of EBOV polymerase. As a proof of principle, we validate two cellular mRNA decay factors from 35 identified host factors: eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1) and up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1). Our data suggest that EBOV can subvert restrictions of cellular mRNA decay and repurpose GSPT1 and UPF1 to promote viral replication. Treating EBOV-infected human hepatocytes with a drug candidate that targets GSPT1 for degradation significantly reduces viral RNA load and particle production. Our work demonstrates the utility of proximity proteomics to capture the functional host interactome of the EBOV polymerase and to illuminate host-dependent regulation of viral RNA synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue homeostasis often requires a properly placed niche to support stem cells. Morphogenetic processes that position a niche are just being described. For the Drosophila testis, we recently showed that pro-niche cells, specified at disparate positions during early gonadogenesis, must assemble into one collective at the anterior of the gonad. We now find that Slit and FGF signals emanating from adjacent visceral mesoderm regulate assembly. In response to signaling, niche cells express islet, which we find is also required for niche assembly. Without signaling, niche cells specified furthest from the anterior are unable to migrate, remaining dispersed. The function of such niches is severely disrupted, with niche cells evading cell cycle quiescence, compromised in their ability to signal the incipient stem cell pool, and failing to orient stem cell divisions properly. Our work identifies both extrinsic signaling and intrinsic responses required for proper assembly and placement of the testis niche.

Abstract: Summary
The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces the unfolded protein response (UPR), which acts through various mechanisms to reduce ER stress. While the UPR has been well studied for its effects on the ER, its impact on the Golgi is less understood. The Golgi complex receives transport vesicles from the endosome through two types of tethering factors: long coiled-coil golgin and the multisubunit Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex. Here, we report that ER stress increases the phosphorylation of golgin Imh1 to maintain the GARP-mediated recycling of the SNAREs Snc1 and Tlg1. We also identify a specific function of the Golgi affected by ER stress and elucidate a homeostatic response to restore this function, which involves both an Ire1-dependent and a MAP kinase Slt2/ERK2-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, our findings advance a general understanding of how two different types of tethers act cooperatively to mediate a transport pathway.

Abstract: Summary
A paradigm of RNA viruses is their ability to mutate and escape from herd immunity. Because antibody responses are a major effector for viral immunity, antigenic sites are usually under strong diversifying pressure. Here, we use norovirus as a model to study mechanisms of antigenic diversification of non-enveloped, fast-evolving RNA viruses. We comprehensively characterize all variable antigenic sites involved in virus neutralization and find that single neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) map to multiple antigenic sites of GII.4 norovirus. Interactions of multiple epitopes on the viral capsid surface provide a broad mAb-binding repertoire with a remarkable difference in the mAb-binding profiles and immunodominance hierarchy for two distantly related GII.4 variants. Time-ordered mutant viruses confirm a progressive change of antibody immunodominance along with point mutations during the process of norovirus evolution. Thus, in addition to point mutations, switches in immunodominance that redirect immune responses could facilitate immune escape in RNA viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Mutation or disruption of the Shank/ProSAP family of genes is a high risk factor for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and intellectual disability. N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction contributes to the development of autism-like behaviors. However, the molecular mechanism of Shank-mediated NMDAR modulation is still not clear. Here, we show that the scaffold protein plenty of SH3s (POSH) directly interacts with two other scaffold proteins, PSD95 and SHANK2/3, at excitatory synapses. In POSH conditional knockout (cKO) mice, normal synaptic clustering of NMDAR/PSD-95/SHANK complex is disrupted, accompanied by abnormal dendritic spine development and glutamatergic transmission in hippocampal neurons. POSH cKO mice display profound autism-like behaviors, including impairments in social interactions, social communication, repetitive behaviors, and deficits in learning and memory. Thus, POSH clusters at the postsynaptic density (PSD) with PSD-95 and SHANK2/3 and plays important roles in the signaling mechanisms of the NMDAR/PSD-95/POSH/SHANK complex as well as in spine development and brain function.

Abstract: Summary
Mammals have limited regenerative capacity, whereas some vertebrates, like fish and salamanders, are able to regenerate their organs efficiently. The regeneration in these species depends on cell dedifferentiation followed by proliferation. We generate a mouse model that enables the inducible expression of the four Yamanaka factors (Oct-3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, or 4F) specifically in hepatocytes. Transient in vivo 4F expression induces partial reprogramming of adult hepatocytes to a progenitor state and concomitantly increases cell proliferation. This is indicated by reduced expression of differentiated hepatic-lineage markers, an increase in markers of proliferation and chromatin modifiers, global changes in DNA accessibility, and an acquisition of liver stem and progenitor cell markers. Functionally, short-term expression of 4F enhances liver regenerative capacity through topoisomerase2-mediated partial reprogramming. Our results reveal that liver-specific 4F expression in vivo induces cellular plasticity and counteracts liver failure, suggesting that partial reprogramming may represent an avenue for enhancing tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Recent findings have demonstrated that mitochondria can be transferred between cells to control metabolic homeostasis. Although the mitochondria of brown adipocytes comprise a large component of the cell volume and undergo reorganization to sustain thermogenesis, it remains unclear whether an intercellular mitochondrial transfer occurs in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and regulates adaptive thermogenesis. Herein, we demonstrated that thermogenically stressed brown adipocytes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain oxidatively damaged mitochondrial parts to avoid failure of the thermogenic program. When re-uptaken by parental brown adipocytes, mitochondria-derived EVs reduced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ signaling and the levels of mitochondrial proteins, including UCP1. Their removal via the phagocytic activity of BAT-resident macrophages is instrumental in preserving BAT physiology. Depletion of macrophages in vivo causes the abnormal accumulation of extracellular mitochondrial vesicles in BAT, impairing the thermogenic response to cold exposure. These findings reveal a homeostatic role of tissue-resident macrophages in the mitochondrial quality control of BAT.

Abstract: In addition to inducing apoptosis, caspase inhibition contributes to necroptosis and/or autophagy depending on the cell type and cellular context. In macrophages, necroptosis can be induced by co-treatment with Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] for TLR4 and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly I:C] for TLR3) and a cell-permeable pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD. Here, we elucidated the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms of cell death. We showed that LPS/zVAD- and poly I:C/zVAD-induced cell death in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) was inhibited by receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) inhibitor necrostatin-1 and autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. Electron microscopic images displayed autophagosome/autolysosomes, and immunoblotting data revealed increased LC3II expression. Although zVAD did not affect LPS- or poly I:C-induced activation of IKK, JNK, and p38, it enhanced IRF3 and STAT1 activation as well as type I interferon (IFN) expression. In addition, zVAD inhibited ERK and Akt phosphorylation induced by LPS and poly I:C. Of note, zVAD-induced enhancement of the IRF3/IFN/STAT1 axis was abolished by necrostatin-1, while zVAD-induced inhibition of ERK and Akt was not. Our data further support the involvement of autocrine IFNs action in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent necroptosis, LPS/zVAD-elicited ROS production was inhibited by necrostatin-1, neutralizing antibody of IFN receptor (IFNR) and JAK inhibitor AZD1480. Accordingly, both cell death and ROS production induced by TLR ligands plus zVAD were abrogated in STAT1 knockout macrophages. We conclude that enhanced TRIF-RIP1-dependent autocrine action of IFNβ, rather than inhibition of ERK or Akt, is involved in TLRs/zVAD-induced autophagic and necroptotic cell death via the JAK/STAT1/ROS pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Unicellular eukaryotes have been suggested to undergo self-inflicted destruction. However, molecular details are sparse compared with the mechanisms of programmed/regulated cell death known for human cells and animal models. Here, we report a molecular cell death pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae leading to vacuole/lysosome membrane permeabilization. Following a transient cell death stimulus, yeast cells die slowly over several hours, consistent with an ongoing molecular dying process. A genome-wide screen for death-promoting factors identified all subunits of the AP-3 complex, a vesicle trafficking adapter known to transport and install newly synthesized proteins on the vacuole/lysosome membrane. To promote cell death, AP-3 requires its Arf1-GTPase-dependent vesicle trafficking function and the kinase Yck3, which is selectively transported to the vacuole membrane by AP-3. Video microscopy revealed a sequence of events where vacuole permeability precedes the loss of plasma membrane integrity. AP-3-dependent death appears to be conserved in the human pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans.

Abstract: Summary
Human brown adipose tissue (BAT) undergoes progressive involution. This involution process is not recapitulated in rodents, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that the interscapular BAT (iBAT) of rabbits whitens rapidly during early adulthood. The transcriptomic remodeling and identity switch of mature adipocytes are accompanied by loss of brown adipogenic competence of progenitors. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that rabbit and human iBAT progenitors highly express the FSTL1 gene. When iBAT involutes in rabbits, adipocyte progenitors reduce FSTL1 expression and are refractory to brown adipogenic recruitment. Conversely, FSTL1 is constitutively expressed in mouse iBAT to sustain WNT signaling and prevent involution. Progenitor incompetence and iBAT paucity can be induced in mice by genetic deletion of the Fstl1 gene or ablation of Fstl1+ progenitors. Our results highlight the hierarchy and dynamics of the BAT progenitor compartment and implicate the functional incompetence of FSTL1-expressing progenitors in BAT involution.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are specialized innate immune cells known for their ability to fight pathogens. However, the mechanisms of neutrophil trafficking to lymph nodes are not fully clear. Using a murine model of dermal infection with Leishmania parasites, we observe a transient neutrophil influx in draining lymph nodes despite sustained recruitment to the infection site. Cell-tracking experiments, together with intravital two-photon microscopy, indicate that neutrophil recruitment to draining lymph nodes occurs minimally through lymphatics from the infected dermis, but mostly through blood vessels via high endothelial venules. Mechanistically, neutrophils do not respond to IL-1β or macrophage-derived molecules. Instead, they are guided by the C5a-C5aR1 axis, using L-selectin and integrins, to extravasate into the draining lymph node parenchyma. We also report that C5, the C5a precursor, is locally produced in the draining lymph node by lymphatic endothelial cells. Our data establish and detail organ-specific mechanisms of neutrophil trafficking.

Abstract: Summary
YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), two major effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway, are frequently activated in human cancers. The activity of YAP/TAZ is strictly repressed upon phosphorylation by LATS1/2 tumor suppressors. However, it is unclear how LATS1/2 are precisely regulated by upstream factors such as Hippo kinases MST1/2. Here, we show that WWC proteins (WWC1/2/3) directly interact with LATS1/2 and SAV1, and SAV1, in turn, brings in MST1/2 to phosphorylate and activate LATS1/2. Hence, WWC1/2/3 play an organizer role in a signaling module that mediates LATS1/2 activation by MST1/2. Moreover, we have defined a minimum protein interaction interface on WWC1/2/3 that is sufficient to activate LATS1/2 in a robust and specific manner. The corresponding minigene, dubbed as SuperHippo, can effectively suppress tumorigenesis in multiple tumor models. Our study has uncovered a molecular mechanism underlying LATS1/2 regulation and provides a strategy for treating diverse malignancies related to Hippo pathway dysregulation.

Abstract: The androgen receptor (AR) is an important therapeutic target for treating prostate cancer (PCa). Moreover, there is an increasing need for understanding the AR-independent progression of tumor cells such as neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). Menin, which is encoded by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), serves as a direct link between AR and the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex in PCa development by activating AR target genes through histone H3 lysine 4 methylation. Although menin is a critical component of AR signaling, its tumorigenic role in AR-independent PCa cells remains unknown. Here, we compared the role of menin in AR-positive and AR-negative PCa cells via RNAi-mediated or pharmacological inhibition of menin. We demonstrated that menin was involved in tumor cell growth and metastasis in PCa cells with low or deficient levels of AR. The inhibition of menin significantly diminished the growth of PCa cells and induced apoptosis, regardless of the presence of AR. Additionally, transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of many metastasis-associated genes was perturbed by menin inhibition in AR-negative DU145 cells. Furthermore, wound-healing assay results showed that menin promoted cell migration in AR-independent cellular contexts. Overall, these findings suggest a critical function of menin in tumorigenesis and provide a rationale for drug development against menin toward targeting high-risk metastatic PCa, especially those independent of AR.

Abstract: Summary
Unlike most cell types, many cancer cells survive at low extracellular pH (pHe), a chemical signature of tumors. Genes that facilitate survival under acid stress are therefore potential targets for cancer therapies. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 cell viability screen at physiological and acidic conditions to systematically identify gene knockouts associated with pH-related fitness defects in colorectal cancer cells. Knockouts of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (NDUFS1) and iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis (IBA57, NFU1) grew well at physiological pHe, but underwent profound cell death under acidic conditions. We identified several small-molecule inhibitors of mitochondrial metabolism that can kill cancer cells at low pHe only. Xenografts established from NDUFS1−/− cells grew considerably slower than their wild-type controls, but growth could be stimulated with systemic bicarbonate therapy that lessens the tumoral acid stress. These findings raise the possibility of therapeutically targeting mitochondrial metabolism in combination with acid stress as a cancer treatment option.

Abstract: Summary
Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are commonly acknowledged as a class of homogeneous non-coding RNAs that guide ribosomal RNA modifications. However, snoRNAs referred to as orphans have largely unknown functions. Here, we systematically profile chromatin-associated snoRNAs (casnoRNAs) in mammalian cells and identify a subgroup of orphan casnoRNAs responding to DNA damage stress, among which SNORA73 shows the most marked reduction in chromatin enrichment. Downregulated SNORA73 maintains cancer genome stability and differentiation block in hematopoietic malignancy. Mechanistically, casnoRNA the 5′ end non-canonical structure of SNORA73 is critical for its function and binding to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). SNORA73 inhibits PARP1 auto-PARylation to affect cancer genome stability by forming a small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) with PARP1 and canonical H/ACA proteins DKC1/NHP2. Our findings reveal the role of an orphan snoRNA serving as casnoRNA and highlights a link between non-canonical structure of snoRNA and their functional diversity.

Abstract: Summary
Resistance to apoptosis due to caspase deregulation is considered one of the main hallmarks of cancer. However, the discovery of novel non-apoptotic caspase functions has revealed unknown intricacies about the interplay between these enzymes and tumor progression. To investigate this biological problem, we capitalized on a Drosophila tumor model with human relevance based on the simultaneous overactivation of the EGFR and the JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Our data indicate that widespread non-apoptotic activation of initiator caspases limits JNK signaling and facilitates cell fate commitment in these tumors, thus preventing the overgrowth and exacerbation of malignant features of transformed cells. Intriguingly, caspase activity also reduces the presence of macrophage-like cells with tumor-promoting properties in the tumor microenvironment. These findings assign tumor-suppressing activities to caspases independent of apoptosis, while providing molecular details to better understand the contribution of these enzymes to tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Transposable elements (TEs) are widespread genetic parasites known to be kept under tight transcriptional control. Here, we describe a functional connection between the mouse-orthologous “nuclear exosome targeting” (NEXT) and “human silencing hub” (HUSH) complexes, involved in nuclear RNA decay and the epigenetic silencing of TEs, respectively. Knocking out the NEXT component ZCCHC8 in embryonic stem cells results in elevated TE RNA levels. We identify a physical interaction between ZCCHC8 and the MPP8 protein of HUSH and establish that HUSH recruits NEXT to chromatin at MPP8-bound TE loci. However, while NEXT and HUSH both dampen TE RNA expression, their activities predominantly affect shorter non-polyadenylated and full-length polyadenylated transcripts, respectively. Indeed, our data suggest that the repressive action of HUSH promotes a condition favoring NEXT RNA decay activity. In this way, transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries synergize to suppress the genotoxic potential of TE RNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Knowledge about the impact of prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of the elderly on mRNA vaccination response is needed to appropriately address the demand for additional vaccinations in this vulnerable population. Here, we show that octogenarians, a high-risk population, mount a sustained SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody response for 15 months following infection. This response boosts antibody levels 35-fold upon receiving a single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine 15 months after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In contrast, antibody responses in naive individuals boost only 6-fold after a second vaccine. Spike-specific angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) antibody binding responses in the previously infected octogenarians following two vaccine doses exceed those found in a naive cohort after two doses. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) demonstrates activation of interferon-induced genetic programs, which persist only in the previously infected. A preferential increase of specific immunoglobulin G heavy chain variable (IGHV) clonal transcripts that are the basis of neutralizing antibodies is observed only in the previously infected nuns.

Abstract: Summary
The DSB machinery, which induces the programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the leptotene and zygotene stages during meiosis, is suppressed before the onset of the pachytene stage. However, the biological significance and underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Here, we report that ZFP541 is indispensable for the suppression of DSB formation after mid-pachytene. The deletion of Zfp541 in mice causes the aberrant recruitment of DSB machinery to chromosome axes and generation of massive DSBs in late pachytene and diplotene spermatocytes, leading to meiotic arrest at the diplotene stage. Integrated analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing data indicate that ZFP541 predominantly binds to promoters of pre-pachytene genes, including meiotic DSB formation-related genes (e.g., Prdm9 and Mei1) and their upstream activators (e.g., Meiosin and Rxra), and maintains their repression in pachytene spermatocytes. Our results reveal that ZFP541 functions as a transcriptional regulator in pachytene spermatocytes, orchestrating the transcriptome to ensure meiosis progression.

Abstract: Summary
The resistance to transcription factor-mediated reprogramming into pluripotent stem cells is one of the distinctive features of cancer cells. Here we dissect the profiles of reprogramming factor binding and the subsequent transcriptional response in cancer cells to reveal its underlying mechanisms. Using clear cell sarcomas (CCSs), we show that the driver oncogene EWS/ATF1 misdirects the reprogramming factors to cancer-specific enhancers and thereby impairs the transcriptional response toward pluripotency that is otherwise provoked. Sensitization to the reprogramming cue is observed in other cancer types when the corresponding oncogenic signals are pharmacologically inhibited. Exploiting this oncogene dependence of the transcriptional “stiffness,” we identify mTOR signaling pathways downstream of EWS/ATF1 and discover that inhibiting mTOR activity substantially attenuates the propagation of CCS cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the early transcriptional response to cell fate perturbations can be a faithful readout to identify effective therapeutics targets in cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
The evolution and adaptation of S. japonicum, a zoonotic parasite that causes human schistosomiasis, remain unclear because of the lack of whole-genome data. We construct a chromosome-level S. japonicum genome and analyze it together with 72 samples representing six populations of the entire endemic region. We observe a Taiwan zoophilic lineage splitting from zoonotic populations ∼45,000 years ago, consistent with the divergent history of their intermediate hosts. Interestingly, we detect a severe population bottleneck in S. japonicum, largely coinciding with human history in Asia during the last glacial maximum. We identify several genomic regions underlying natural selection, including GATAD2A and Lmln, both showing remarkable differentiation among different areas. RNAi knockdown suggests association of GATAD2A with parasite development and infection in definitive hosts, while Lmln relates to the specificity of the intermediate hosts. Our study provides insights into the evolution of S. japonicum and serves as a resource for further studies.

Abstract: Most Majoidea crabs display high sperm competition rates due to the development of spermatic strata within the seminal receptacle (SR). To verify the occurrence of sperm competition, SR anatomy and histochemistry analyses were performed in Mithrax hispidus, Omalacantha bicornuta, and Mithraculus forceps. The SR of the three Mithracidae species is classified into two regions, one of mesodermal origin (dorsal), consisting of a stratified epithelium with desquamation cells that produce a holocrine secretion, and the other, an ectodermal region (ventral) comprising a simple cubic epithelium covered by a cuticle. The oviduct opens in a ventral position near the transition region, which exhibits more pronounced folds on the opposite face of the oviduct, which may aid fertilization due to the presence of an external musculature. Sperm masses in a circular format were observed in the SR lumen, reminiscent of coenospermic spermatophores, and no morphological evidence strata of sperm packets were observed in any of the three studied species. The ventral SR followed the most common pattern observed in Majoidea. The secretion produced in the receptacle is composed of glycoproteins, with neutral polysaccharides. Acidic polysaccharides probably play a role against microorganisms from male seminal fluid. Due to the absence sperm packets, we were unable to determine whether the investigated females receive material from more than one male nor (if this does, in fact, occur) whether any preference for the spermatozoa of one male over another takes place during fertilization, that can may indicate the absence of sperm competition in the investigated species.

Abstract: Summary
Several mental illnesses, characterized by aberrant stress reactivity, often arise after early-life adversity (ELA). However, it is unclear how ELA affects stress-related brain circuit maturation, provoking these enduring vulnerabilities. We find that ELA increases functional excitatory synapses onto stress-sensitive hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing neurons, resulting from disrupted developmental synapse pruning by adjacent microglia. Microglial process dynamics and synaptic element engulfment were attenuated in ELA mice, associated with deficient signaling of the microglial phagocytic receptor MerTK. Accordingly, selective chronic chemogenetic activation of ELA microglia increased microglial process dynamics and reduced excitatory synapse density to control levels. Notably, selective early-life activation of ELA microglia normalized adult acute and chronic stress responses, including stress-induced hormone secretion and behavioral threat responses, as well as chronic adrenal hypertrophy of ELA mice. Thus, microglial actions during development are powerful contributors to mechanisms by which ELA sculpts the connectivity of stress-regulating neurons, promoting vulnerability to stress and stress-related mental illnesses.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the complexities of behavior is necessary to interpret neurophysiological data and establish animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. This understanding requires knowledge of the underlying information-processing structure—something often hidden from direct observation. Commonly, one assumes that behavior is solely governed by the experimenter-controlled rules that determine tasks. For example, differences in tasks that require memory of past actions are often interpreted as exclusively resulting from differences in memory. However, such assumptions are seldom tested. Here, we provide a comprehensive examination of multiple processes that contribute to behavior in a prevalent experimental paradigm. Using a combination of behavioral automation, hypothesis-driven trial design, and reinforcement learning modeling, we show that rats learn a spatial alternation task consistent with their drawing upon spatial preferences in addition to memory. Our approach also distinguishes learning based on established preferences from generalization of task structure, providing further insights into learning dynamics.

Abstract: Background
Gum Arabic (GA) has a protective role against experimental nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. This study explores the possible ameliorating effect of Gum Arabic on the liver tissues of the uremic rats.
Materials & methods
50 adult male albino rats were divided into 5 groups; Group I, (negative control). Group II: two ﬂank incisions were made and the kidneys were kindly manipulated. Group III: the rats have received a daily oral dose of GA. Group IV: subtotal nephrectomy in the left kidney was done followed by total nephrectomy on the right kidney 1 week later to induce uremia. Group V: the rats received GA one day after the second operation and daily for 5 weeks. At the end of the work, the rats were sacrificed, blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis. The abdomen was opened and the liver was dissected for light, electron microscopic and immunohistochemical studies.
Results
The biochemical results were increased in the uremic group, but greatly improved after GA administration. Light and electron studies showed histopathological changes of the liver tissues in the uremic group, which was improved after GA administration and confirmed by the morphometric measures.
Conclusion
GA ameliorates the histopathological changes of the liver tissues caused by uremic toxins and has a protective effect against the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abstract: Summary
Tendon maturation lays the foundation for postnatal tendon development, its proper mechanical function, and regeneration, but the critical cell populations and the entangled mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, by integrating the structural, mechanical, and molecular properties, we show that post-natal days 7–14 are the crucial transitional stage for mouse tendon maturation. We decode the cellular and molecular regulatory networks at the single-cell level. We find that a nerve growth factor (NGF)-secreting Cd9+Cd271+ tendon stem/progenitor cell population mainly prompts conversion from neonate to adult tendon. Through single-cell gene regulatory network analysis, in vitro inhibitor identification, and in vivo tendon-specific Shp2 deletion, we find that SHP2 signaling is a regulator for tendon maturation. Our research comprehensively reveals the dynamic cell population transition during tendon maturation, implementing insights into the critical roles of the maturation-related stem cell population and SHP2 signaling pathway during tendon differentiation and regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Immunotherapy has achieved limited success in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. Commensal microbiota have been proven to colonize the mammary gland, but whether and how they modulate the tumor microenvironment remains elusive. We performed a multiomics analysis of a cohort of patients with TNBC (n = 360) and found genera under Clostridiales, and the related metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) was more abundant in tumors with an activated immune microenvironment. Patients with higher plasma TMAO achieved better responses to immunotherapy. Mechanistically, TMAO induced pyroptosis in tumor cells by activating the endoplasmic reticulum stress kinase PERK and thus enhanced CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in TNBC in vivo. Collectively, our findings offer new insights into microbiota-metabolite-immune crosstalk and indicate that microbial metabolites, such as TMAO or its precursor choline, may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to promote the efficacy of immunotherapy in TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
The neurons in the cerebral cortex are not randomly interconnected. This specificity in wiring can result from synapse formation mechanisms that connect neurons, depending on their electrical activity and genetically defined identity. Here, we report that the morphological properties of the neurons provide an additional prominent source by which wiring specificity emerges in cortical networks. This morphologically determined wiring specificity reflects similarities between the neurons’ axo-dendritic projections patterns, the packing density, and the cellular diversity of the neuropil. The higher these three factors are, the more recurrent is the topology of the network. Conversely, the lower these factors are, the more feedforward is the network’s topology. These principles predict the empirically observed occurrences of clusters of synapses, cell type-specific connectivity patterns, and nonrandom network motifs. Thus, we demonstrate that wiring specificity emerges in the cerebral cortex at subcellular, cellular, and network scales from the specific morphological properties of its neuronal constituents.

Abstract: Summary
Biological age (BA) has been proposed to evaluate the aging status instead of chronological age (CA). Our study shows evidence that there might be multiple “clocks” within the whole-body system: systemic aging drivers/clocks overlaid with organ/tissue-specific counterparts. We utilize multi-omics data, including clinical tests, immune repertoire, targeted metabolomic molecules, gut microbiomes, physical fitness examinations, and facial skin examinations, to estimate the BA of different organs (e.g., liver, kidney) and systems (immune and metabolic system). The aging rates of organs/systems are diverse. People’s aging patterns are different. We also demonstrate several applications of organs/systems BA in two independent datasets. Mortality predictions are compared among organs' BA in the dataset of the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Polygenic risk score of BAs constructed in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey cohort can predict the possibility of becoming centenarian.

Abstract: Summary
Nav1.7 represents a preeminent target for next-generation analgesics for its critical role in pain sensation. Here we report a 2.2-Å resolution cryo-EM structure of wild-type (WT) Nav1.7 complexed with the β1 and β2 subunits that reveals several previously indiscernible cytosolic segments. Reprocessing of the cryo-EM data for our reported structures of Nav1.7(E406K) bound to various toxins identifies two distinct conformations of S6IV, one composed of α helical turns only and the other containing a π helical turn in the middle. The structure of ligand-free Nav1.7(E406K), determined at 3.5-Å resolution, is identical to the WT channel, confirming that binding of Huwentoxin IV or Protoxin II to VSDII allosterically induces the α → π transition of S6IV. The local secondary structural shift leads to contraction of the intracellular gate, closure of the fenestration on the interface of repeats I and IV, and rearrangement of the binding site for the fast inactivation motif.

Abstract: Summary
Bone stromal cells are critical for bone homeostasis and regeneration. Growing evidence suggests that non-stem bone niche cells support bone homeostasis and regeneration via paracrine mechanisms, which remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that physiologically quiescent SM22α-lineage stromal cells expand after bone injury to regulate diverse processes of intramembranous bone regeneration. The majority of SM22α-lineage cells neither act as stem cells in vivo nor show their expression patterns. Dysfunction of SM22α-lineage niche cells induced by loss of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) impairs bone repair. We further show that PDGFRβ-triggered hydrogen sulfide (H2S) generation in SM22α-lineage niche cells facilitates osteogenesis and angiogenesis and suppresses overactive osteoclastogenesis. Collectively, these data demonstrate that non-stem SM22α-lineage niche cells support the niche for bone regeneration with a PDGFRβ/H2S-dependent regulatory mechanism. Our findings provide further insight into non-stem bone stromal niche cell populations and niche-regulation strategy for bone repair.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-cell communication systems typically comprise families of ligand and receptor variants that function together in combinations. Pathway activation depends on the complex way in which ligands are presented extracellularly and receptors are expressed by the signal-receiving cell. To understand the combinatorial logic of such a system, we systematically measured pairwise bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligand interactions in cells with varying receptor expression. Ligands could be classified into equivalence groups based on their profile of positive and negative synergies with other ligands. These groups varied with receptor expression, explaining how ligands can functionally replace each other in one context but not another. Context-dependent combinatorial interactions could be explained by a biochemical model based on the competitive formation of alternative signaling complexes with distinct activities. Together, these results provide insights into the roles of BMP combinations in developmental and therapeutic contexts and establish a framework for analyzing other combinatorial, context-dependent signaling systems.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic networks are characterized by extensive buffering. During tumor evolution, disruption of functional redundancies can create de novo vulnerabilities that are specific to cancer cells. Here, we systematically search for cancer-relevant paralog interactions using CRISPR screens and publicly available loss-of-function datasets. Our analysis reveals >2,000 candidate dependencies, several of which we validate experimentally, including CSTF2-CSTF2T, DNAJC15-DNAJC19, FAM50A-FAM50B, and RPP25-RPP25L. We provide evidence that RPP25L can physically and functionally compensate for the absence of RPP25 as a member of the RNase P/MRP complexes in tRNA processing. Our analysis also reveals unexpected redundancies between sex chromosome genes. We show that chrX- and chrY-encoded paralogs, such as ZFX-ZFY, DDX3X-DDX3Y, and EIF1AX-EIF1AY, are functionally linked. Tumor cell lines from male patients with loss of chromosome Y become dependent on the chrX-encoded gene. We propose targeting of chrX-encoded paralogs as a general therapeutic strategy for human tumors that have lost the Y chromosome.

Abstract: Summary
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is an important extracellular human pathogen. The initial adherence of EHEC to host cells is a major cue for transcriptional induction of the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) genes to promote colonization and pathogenesis, but the mechanism through which this adherence is sensed and the LEE is induced remains largely elusive. Here, we report a complete signal transduction pathway for this virulence activation process. In this pathway, the outer-membrane lipoprotein NlpE senses a mechanical cue generated from initial host adherence and activates the BaeSR two-component regulatory system; the response regulator BaeR then directly activates the expression of airA located on O-island-134 and encoding a LEE transcriptional activator. Disruption of this pathway severely attenuates EHEC O157:H7 virulence both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides further insights into the evolution of EHEC pathogenesis and the host-pathogen interaction.

Abstract: Altered expression of transient receptor potential channel melastatin 4 (TRPM4) contributes to several diseases, including cardiac conduction disorders, immune diseases, and cancer. Yet the underlying mechanisms of TRPM4 expression changes remain elusive. In this study, we report that loss of tumor suppressor protein p53 or p63γ function or mutation of a putative p53 response element in the TRPM4 promoter region increase TRPM4 promoter activity in the colorectal cancer cell line HCT 116. In cells that lack p53 expression, we observed increased TRPM4 mRNA and protein levels and TRPM4-mediated Na+ currents. This phenotype can be reversed by transient overexpression of p53. In the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, which expresses p53 endogenously, p53 overexpression decreases TRPM4-mediated currents. As in other cancer cells, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of TRPM4 in p53 deficient HCT 116 cells results in increased store-operated Ca2+entry. The effect of the TRPM4 knockout is mimicked by p53 mediated suppression of TRPM4 in the parental cell line expressing TRPM4. In addition, a TRPM4 knockout-mediated shift in cell cycle is abolished upon loss of p53. Taken together, these findings indicate that p53 represses TRPM4 expression, thereby altering cellular Ca2+ signaling and that TRPM4 adds to cell cycle shift dependent on p53 signaling. One sentence summary: TRPM4 is repressed in the p53 pathway leading to reduced currents and increased calcium signaling.

At present, there are two main methods to obtain mouse embryonic palatal mesenchymal (MEPM) cells, while no systematic investigation about characteristics of cells using these two methods to get a clear application. In this study, using the traditional two-step primary culture method as the control group, we found that the MEPM cells of the simplified one-step method and the control group were both consistent with the surface markers of mesenchymal stem cells. The vimentin (mesenchymal marker) was positive, cytokeratin 14 (CK14, epithelium marker) was negative. In addition, along with the increasing passages, the cells cultured by two methods had similar changes with a decreasing proliferation activity, increasing apoptosis rate, declining migration, diminishing stemness, and obvious senescence. Moreover, the senescence of MEPM cells in the one-step group was lower than that in the control group. Our findings indicate that there are no significant differences between the two methods and one-step method can be a good method in investigating palatal development mechanisms by shortening the processing of the MEPM cell culture and may reduce the damage to the cells done by more enzymes and processing.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of biological rhythms plays a role in a wide range of psychiatric disorders. We report mechanistic insights into the rhythms of rapid dopamine signals and cholinergic interneurons (CINs) working in concert in the rodent striatum. These rhythms mediate diurnal variation in conditioned responses to reward-associated cues. We report that the dopamine signal-to-noise ratio varies according to the time of day and that phasic signals are magnified during the middle of the dark cycle in rats. We show that CINs provide the mechanism for diurnal variation in rapid dopamine signals by serving as a gain of function to the dopamine signal-to-noise ratio that adjusts across time of day. We also show that conditioned responses to reward-associated cues exhibit diurnal rhythms, with cue-directed behaviors observed exclusively midway through the dark cycle. We conclude that the rapid dopamine signaling rhythm is mediated by a diurnal rhythm in CIN activity, which influences learning and motivated behaviors across the time of day.

Abstract: Summary
Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) plays a key role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by mediating protein folding via catalyzing disulfide bond formation, breakage, and rearrangement in the endoplasmic reticulum. Increasing evidence suggests that PDI can be a potential treatment target for several diseases. However, the function of PDI in the peripheral sensory nervous system is unclear. Here we report the expression and secretion of PDI from primary sensory neurons is upregulated in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. Deletion of PDI in nociceptive DRG neurons results in a reduction in inflammatory and neuropathic heat hyperalgesia. We demonstrate that secreted PDI activates TRPV1 channels through oxidative modification of extracellular cysteines of the channel, indicating that PDI acts as an unconventional positive modulator of TRPV1. These findings suggest that PDI in primary sensory neurons plays an important role in development of heat hyperalgesia and can be a potential therapeutic target for chronic pain.

Abstract: Summary
Sulfs represent a class of unconventional sulfatases which provide an original post-synthetic regulatory mechanism for heparan sulfate polysaccharides and are involved in multiple physiopathological processes, including cancer. However, Sulfs remain poorly characterized enzymes, with major discrepancies regarding their in vivo functions. Here we show that human Sulf-2 (HSulf-2) harbors a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain, attached to the enzyme substrate-binding domain. We demonstrate that this GAG chain affects enzyme/substrate recognition and tunes HSulf-2 activity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we show that mammalian hyaluronidase acts as a promoter of HSulf-2 activity by digesting its GAG chain. In conclusion, our results highlight HSulf-2 as a proteoglycan-related enzyme and its GAG chain as a critical non-catalytic modulator of the enzyme activity. These findings contribute to clarifying the conflicting data on the activities of the Sulfs.

Abstract: Summary
Despite their importance in tissue homeostasis and renewal, human pituitary stem cells (PSCs) are incompletely characterized. We describe a human single nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq resource from pediatric, adult, and aged postmortem pituitaries (snpituitaryatlas.princeton.edu) and characterize cell-type-specific gene expression and chromatin accessibility programs for all major pituitary cell lineages. We identify uncommitted PSCs, committing progenitor cells, and sex differences. Pseudotime trajectory analysis indicates that early-life PSCs are distinct from the other age groups. Linear modeling of same-cell multiome data identifies regulatory domain accessibility sites and transcription factors that are significantly associated with gene expression in PSCs compared with other cell types and within PSCs. We identify distinct deterministic mechanisms that contribute to heterogeneous marker expression within PSCs. These findings characterize human stem cell lineages and reveal diverse mechanisms regulating key PSC genes and cell type identity.

Abstract: Summary
Host interferons (IFNs) powerfully restrict viruses through the action of several hundred IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products, many of which remain uncharacterized. Here, using RNAi screening, we identify several ISG restriction factors with previously undescribed contributions to IFN-mediated defense. Notably, RABGAP1L, a Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC)-domain-containing protein involved in regulation of small membrane-bound GTPases, robustly potentiates IFN action against influenza A viruses (IAVs). Functional studies reveal that the catalytically active TBC domain of RABGAP1L promotes antiviral activity, and the RABGAP1L proximal interactome uncovered its association with proteins involved in endosomal sorting, maturation, and trafficking. In this regard, RABGAP1L overexpression is sufficient to disrupt endosomal function during IAV infection and restricts an early post-attachment, but pre-fusion, stage of IAV cell entry. Other RNA viruses that enter cells primarily via endocytosis are also impaired by RABGAP1L, while entry promiscuous SARS-CoV-2 is resistant. Our data highlight virus endocytosis as a key target for host defenses.

Abstract: Summary
Fallopian tube (FT) homeostasis requires dynamic regulation of heterogeneous cell populations and is disrupted in infertility and ovarian cancer. Here, we applied single-cell RNA-seq to profile 59,738 FT cells from four healthy, pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal, and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified four ciliated and six non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells and the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed 17,798 cells from two hydrosalpinx samples and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations and cell-type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-β signaling; this underscores fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies aimed at expanding understanding of fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease.

Abstract: RACGAP1 (Rac GTPase-activating protein 1) is correlated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis, but the role of RACGAP1 in cervical cancer has not been fully reported. Analysis of RACGAP1 expression data in cervical cancer from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was carried out by GEPIA and UALCAN websites. In addition, the UALCAN database was used to identify the RACGAP1 positively correlated genes, which were used for the enrichment analysis. qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and immunofluorescence were utilized to measure RACGAP1 expression in tissues and cells. Western blot, flow cytometry, MTT, and colony formation assays were applied to assess the effects of RACGAP1 on cell cycle, growth and viability in cervical cancer. Through bioinformatics analysis, we found that the level of RACGAP1 was aberrantly increased in cervical cancer, which was confirmed in cervical cancer tissues and cells. RACGAP1 associated genes, including CDC25C, were mainly enriched in cell cycle pathway, and RACGAP1 expression was negatively associated with CDC25C expression. RACGAP1 overexpression was related to patient’s poor prognosis and promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, RACGAP1 knockdown decreased the level of CDC2, p-CDC2, CDC25C, and Cyclin B1, inhibited proliferation and delayed cell cycle progression in cervical cancer cells. In mechanism, overexpression of CDC25C attenuated RACGAP1 knockdown-mediated cell growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest. Taken together, this study demonstrated that RACGAP1 was overexpressed in cervical cancer, and downregulation of RACGAP1 could inhibit the cervical cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression through regulating CDC25C expression.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular heterogeneity of aortic valves complicates the mechanistic evaluation of the calcification processes in calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), and animal disease models are lacking. In this study, we identify a disease-driver population (DDP) within valvular interstitial cells (VICs). Through stepwise single-cell analysis, phenotype-guided omic profiling, and network-based analysis, we characterize the DDP fingerprint as CD44highCD29+CD59+CD73+CD45low and discover potential key regulators of human CAVD. These DDP-VICs demonstrate multi-lineage differentiation and osteogenic properties. Temporal proteomic profiling of DDP-VICs identifies potential targets for therapy, including MAOA and CTHRC1. In vitro loss-of-function experiments confirm our targets. Such a stepwise strategy may be advantageous for therapeutic target discovery in other disease contexts.

Abstract: This study examines the anatomical development of the visual system of Atlantic bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, during the first 15 days of life at histological level, with emphasis in the immunohistochemical characterization of different cell types. As an altricial fish species, the retina was not developed at hatching. The appearance of eye pigmentation and the transformation of the retina from an undifferentiated neuroblastic layer into a laminated structure occurred during the first two days of life. At 16 days after hatching (DAH), the ganglion cells were arranged in a single row in the central region of the retina and the outer segments of the photoreceptors were morphologically developed. Furthermore, at this age, all the retinal cell types were immunohistochemically characterized. The presence of ganglion cell axons was confirmed with the TUJ1 antibody and the existence of functional synapses in the plexiform layers with antibodies against SV2. Cone opsins were immunostained with antibodies against visinin and CERN-922 immunoreactive rods were also identified. Different subpopulations of amacrine cells were immunostained with antibodies against αTH and PV. Highly GS-immunoreactive Müller cells were also detected at this age. These observations suggested that the T. thynnus retina was fully functional at the end of the second week of life. Basic studies on early morphology of the visual system and larval behavior are necessary to support applied research on larval rearing. Furthermore, they may have implications for understanding larval ecology in the wild.

Abstract: Summary
The inflammatory response is tightly regulated, but its regulatory principles are still incompletely understood. Cyclophilin A (CypA) has long been considered as a pro-inflammatory factor. Here, we discover how CypA precisely regulates interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-mediated inflammatory responses. In lipopolysaccharide-treated mice, CypA deficiency initially inhibits and then promotes lung inflammation, which is closely related to IL-1β production. Mechanistically, CypA not only facilitates pro-IL-1β processing by increasing Smurf1-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination in an ATP-dependent manner but also accelerates pro-IL-1β degradation, depending on Smurf1-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination. Moreover, in IL-1β-treated mice, CypA exacerbates lung injury by enhancing cytokine production. It also upregulates the ILK/AKT pathway by inhibiting Cyld-mediated K63-linked ILK deubiquitination, which promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to facilitate lung repair. Collectively, CypA promotes inflammation activation by increasing IL-1β production and then promotes inflammation resolution by enhancing redundant pro-IL-1β degradation and IL-1β-induced EMT, indicating the complex and delicate regulation of inflammatory response.

Abstract: Objective
The critical role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in osteoporosis (OP) has been highlighted. We tried to explore the role of circPVT1 in OP in relation to microRNA-30d-5p (miR-30d-5p) and ITGB3.
Methods
After bone marrow collection, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated and identified. Then, Pearson coefficient was used to analyze the correlation among circPVT1, miR-30d-5p and ITGB3, and the binding sites were predicted and verified. Gain- and loss-of function assays in circPVT1, miR-30d-5p and ITGB3 were performed to analyze their effect on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.
Results
The osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs from OP patients was significantly decreased, and reduced circPVT1 expression was found in the BMSCs from OP patients. Overexpression of circPVT1 stimulated the formation of calcified nodules, increased alkaline phosphatase activity, and enhanced the expression of osteogenic marker genes in the BMSCs from OP patients. Additionally, circPVT1 expression was negatively correlated with miR-30d-5p, and miR-30d-5p was negatively correlated with ITGB3 in OP patients. Mechanically, circPVT1 regulated the osteogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs by relieving the inhibition of miR-30d-5p on ITGB3 through the competitive endogenous RNA mechanism.
Conclusion
Our study highlighted a circPVT1/miR-30d-5p/ITGB3 axis in regulating osteogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs from OP patients.

Abstract: The Piezo1 channel, a mechanosensitive channel that exhibit a preference for Ca2+, play multifarious physiological and pathological roles in the endothelium and epithelium of various tissues. However, the functional expression of Piezo1 channel in the epithelium of the male reproductive tract remains unknown. In the present study, the expression of Piezo1 channel in the rat epididymis was determined by real-time quantitative PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. Our data revealed that Piezo1 channel was located in the epithelial layer of the rat epididymis, with higher expression levels in the corpus and cauda regions. The pro-secretion function of Piezo1 channel was then investigated using short circuit current (ISC) and intracellular Ca2+ imaging techniques. Application of Yoda1, a selective Piezo1 channel activator, stimulated a remarkable decrease in the ISC of the epididymal epithelium. Pharmacological experiments revealed that the ISC response induced by Piezo1 channel activation was abolished by pretreating epithelial cells with the Yoda1 analogue, Dooku1, the selective mechanosensitive cation channel blocker, GsMTx4, or removal of basolateral K+. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that activation of Piezo1 channel triggered a robust Ca2+ influx in epididymal epithelial cells. The possible involvement of Ca2+- activated K+channels (KCa) in transepithelial K+ secretion was then evaluated. And that big conductance KCa (BK), but not small conductance or intermediate conductance KCa, mediated Piezo1-elicited transepithelial K+ secretion. Moreover, we demonstrated that NKCC and NKA were responsible for supplying substrate K+ during transepithelial K+ secretion. These data demonstrate that the activation of Piezo1 channel promotes BK-mediated transepithelial K+ secretion, and thus may plays an important role in the formation of a high K+ concentration in epididymal intraluminal fluid.

Abstract: Summary
CK1s are acidophilic serine/threonine kinases with multiple critical cellular functions; their misregulation contributes to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and sleep phase disorders. Here, we describe an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of CK1 activity: autophosphorylation of a threonine (T220 in human CK1δ) located at the N terminus of helix αG, proximal to the substrate binding cleft. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations uncovered inherent plasticity in αG that increased upon T220 autophosphorylation. The phosphorylation-induced structural changes significantly altered the conformation of the substrate binding cleft, affecting substrate specificity. In T220 phosphorylated yeast and human CK1s, activity toward many substrates was decreased, but we also identified a high-affinity substrate that was phosphorylated more rapidly, and quantitative phosphoproteomics revealed that disrupting T220 autophosphorylation rewired CK1 signaling in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. T220 is present exclusively in the CK1 family, thus its autophosphorylation may have evolved as a unique regulatory mechanism for this important family.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying cellular functions dysregulated by disease-associated variants could implicate novel pathways for drug targeting or modulation in cell therapies. However, follow-up studies can be challenging if disease-relevant cell types are difficult to sample. Variants associated with immune diseases point toward the role of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells). We mapped genetic regulation (quantitative trait loci [QTL]) of gene expression and chromatin activity in Treg cells, and we identified 133 colocalizing loci with immune disease variants. Colocalizations of immune disease genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants with expression QTLs (eQTLs) controlling the expression of CD28 and STAT5A, involved in Treg cell activation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling, support the contribution of Treg cells to the pathobiology of immune diseases. Finally, we identified seven known drug targets suitable for drug repurposing and suggested 63 targets with drug tractability evidence among the GWAS signals that colocalized with Treg cell QTLs. Our study is the first in-depth characterization of immune disease variant effects on Treg cell gene expression modulation and dysregulation of Treg cell function.

Abstract: Background
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) as an inorganic compound is used to treat various cancers and other diseases. It has been reported that arsenic trioxide induced cellular apoptosis in certain kinds of cancers, including prostate cancers. The present study aimed to elucidate the crucial cooperative role of arsenic trioxide and Curcumin and their ability to protect against prostate cancers by targeting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and expression of apoptosis-related genes.
Material and methods
The human prostate cell lines (LNCaP and PC3) were treated with different concentrations of Curcumin and As2O3 alone and combined to find effective doses and IC50 values. Percentages of apoptotic cells were evaluated by Annexin/P.I. staining, the proliferative inhibitory effect was assessed by Micro Culture Tetrazolium Test (MTT), and mRNA levels of KLK2, E-cadherin, SNAIL, angiogenesis genes (VEGFA and VEGFC), and apoptosis genes (BAX, Bcl2, and P53) expression were investigated by the real-time PCR method. ANOVA and t-test were used to appraise the results.
Results
For the first time, we presented that the combination therapy of Curcumin and As2O3 increases prostate cancer cell apoptosis and inhibits proliferation; Our data displayed that Curcumin (15 μM and 10 μM in PC3 and LNCap), As2O3 (8 μM and 5 μM in PC3 and LNCap), and also their combination (15 μM Curcumin and 8 μM As2O3 in PC3, 10 μM Curcumin and 5 μM As2O3 in LNCap cell lines) significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells and inhibited cell growth (P < 0.05) compared with each drug alone. Generally, both cell lines treated with the combination of Curcumin and As2O3 displayed decreased angiogenesis genes (VEGFA and VEGFC), apoptosis genes (BAX and Bcl2), and prostate cancer marker (KLK2), the zinc-finger protein (SNAIL); and an increase in expression (P < 0.05) of cell–cell adhesion molecule (E-cadherin) and tumor suppressor gene (P53) genes.
