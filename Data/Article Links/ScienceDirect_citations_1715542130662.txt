Abstract: Methyl donors play critical roles in nutritional programming through epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Here we fed gestational sows with control or betaine-supplemented diets (3g/kg) throughout the pregnancy to explore the effects of maternal methyl-donor nutrient on neonatal expression of hepatic lipogenic genes. Betaine-exposed piglets demonstrated significantly lower liver triglyceride content associated with down-regulated hepatic expression of lipogenic genes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c. Moreover, s-adenosyl methionine to s-adenosyl homocysteine ratio was elevated in the liver of betaine-exposed piglets, which was accompanied by DNA hypermethylation on FAS and SCD gene promoters and more enriched repression histone mark H3K27me3 on SCD gene promoter. Furthermore, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding to SCD gene promoter was diminished along with reduced serum cortisol and liver GR protein content in betaine-exposed piglets. GR-mediated SCD gene regulation was confirmed in HepG2 cells in vitro. Dexamethasone (Dex) drastically increased the luciferase activity of porcine SCD promoter, while the deletion of GR response element on SCD promoter significantly attenuated Dex-mediated SCD transactivation. In addition, miR-let-7e, miR-1285 and miR-124a, which respectively target porcine SCD, ACC and GR, were significantly up-regulated in the liver of betaine-exposed piglets, being in accordance with decreased protein content of these three genes. Taken together, our results suggest that maternal dietary betaine supplementation during gestation attenuates hepatic lipogenesis in neonatal piglets via epigenetic and GR-mediated mechanisms.

Abstract: During evolution, the male gametophyte of Angiosperms has been severely reduced to the pollen grain, consisting of a vegetative cell containing two sperm cells. This vegetative cell has to deliver the sperm cells from the stigma through the style to the ovule. It does so by producing a pollen tube and elongating it to many centimeters in length in some species, requiring vast amounts of fatty acid and membrane lipid synthesis. In order to optimize this polar tip growth, a unique lipid composition in the pollen has evolved. Pollen tubes produce extraplastidial galactolipids and store triacylglycerols in lipid droplets, probably needed as precursors of glycerolipids or for acyl editing. They also possess special sterol and sphingolipid moieties that might together form microdomains in the membranes. The individual lipid classes, the proteins involved in their synthesis as well as the corresponding Arabidopsis knockout mutant phenotypes are discussed in this review.

Abstract: Part of medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) coming from dietary triglycerides (TGs) can be directly absorbed through the gastric mucosa after the action of preduodenal lipase (lingual lipase in the rat). MCFA gastric absorption, particularly that of octanoic acid (C8:0), may have a physiological importance in the octanoylation of ghrelin, the orexigenic gastric peptide acting as an endogenous ligand of the hypothalamic growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR-1a). However, the amount of C8:0 absorbed in the stomach and its metabolic fate still haven't been clearly characterized. The purpose of the present study was to further characterize and quantify the importance of preduodenal lipase activity on the release and gastric absorption of dietary C8:0 and on the subsequent ghrelin octanoylation in the stomach mucosa. Fifteen days old rats received fat emulsions containing triolein or [1,1,1-13C]-Tri-C8:0 and a specific inhibitor of preduodenal lipase, 5-(2-(benzyloxy)ethoxy)-3-(3-phenoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2(3H)-one or BemPPOX. The fate of the 13C-C8:0 was followed in rat tissues after 30 and 120min of digestion and octanoylated ghrelin was measured in the plasma. This work (1) demonstrates that part of C8:0 coming from Tri-C8:0 is directly absorbed at the gastric level, (2) allows the estimation of C8:0 gastric absorption level (1.3% of the 13C-C8:0 in sn-3 position after 30min of digestion), as well as (3) the contribution of rat lingual lipase to total lipolysis and to duodenal absorption of dietary FAs (at least 30%), (4) shows no short-term effect of dietary Tri-C8:0 consumption and subsequent increase of C8:0 gastric tissue content on plasma octanoylated ghrelin concentration.

Abstract: Membrane lipids are gaining increasing attention in the clinical biomarker field, as they are associated with different pathologic processes such as cancer or neurodegenerative diseases. Analyzing human colonoscopic sections by matrix assisted laser/desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging techniques, we identified a defined number of lipid species changing concomitant to the colonocyte differentiation and according to a quite simple mathematical expression. These species felt into two lipid families tightly associated in signaling: phosphatidylinositols and arachidonic acid-containing lipids. On the other hand, an opposed pattern was observed in lamina propria for AA-containing lipids, coinciding with the physiological distribution of the immunological response cells in this tissue. Importantly, the lipid gradient was accompanied by a gradient in expression of enzymes involved in lipid mobilization. Finally, both lipid and protein gradients were lost in adenomatous polyps. The latter allowed us to assess how different a single lipid species is handled in a pathological context depending on the cell type. The strict patterns of distribution in lipid species and lipid enzymes described here unveil the existence of fine regulatory mechanisms orchestrating the lipidome according to the physiological state of the cell. In addition, these results provide solid evidence that the cell lipid fingerprint image can be used to predict precisely the physiological and pathological status of a cell, reinforcing its translational impact in clinical research.

Abstract: Lysosomes and mitochondria occupy a central stage in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, by playing complementary roles in nutrient sensing and energy metabolism. Specifically, these organelles function as signaling hubs that integrate environmental and endogenous stimuli with specific metabolic responses. In particular, they control various lipid biosynthetic and degradative pipelines, either directly or indirectly, by regulating major cellular metabolic pathways, and by physical and functional connections established with each other and with other organelles. Membrane contact sites allow the exchange of ions and molecules between organelles, even without membrane fusion, and are privileged routes for lipid transfer among different membrane compartments. These inter-organellar connections typically involve the endoplasmic reticulum. Direct membrane contacts have now been described also between lysosomes, autophagosomes, lipid droplets, and mitochondria. This review focuses on these recently identified membrane contact sites, and on their role in lipid biosynthesis, exchange, turnover and catabolism.

Abstract: Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are two of the most abundant phospholipids in cells. Although both lipids can be synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in S. cerevisiae PE can also be produced in mitochondria and endosomes; this PE can be transported back to the ER where it is converted to PC. In this study we found that dithiothreitol (DTT), which induces ER stress, decreases PE export from mitochondria to the ER. This results in decreased levels of total cellular PC and mitochondrial PC. These decreases were not caused by changes in levels of PC synthesizing or degrading enzymes. PE export from mitochondria to the ER during ER stress was further reduced in cells lacking Mdm10p, a component of an ER-mitochondrial tethering complex that may facilitated lipid exchange between these compartments. We also found that reducing mitochondrial PC levels induces mitophagy. In conclusion, we show that ER stress affected PE export from mitochondria to ER and the Mdm10p is important for this process.

Abstract: Photosynthetic microalgae have promise as biofuel feedstock. Under certain conditions, they produce substantial amounts of neutral lipids, mainly in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs), which can be converted to fuels. Much of our current knowledge on the genetic and molecular basis of algal neutral lipid metabolism derives mainly from studies of plants, i.e. seed tissues, and to a lesser extent from direct studies of algal lipid metabolism. Thus, the knowledge of TAG synthesis and the cellular trafficking of TAG precursors in algal cells is to a large extent based on genome predictions, and most aspects of TAG metabolism have yet to be experimentally verified. The biofuel prospects of microalgae have raised the interest in mechanistic studies of algal TAG biosynthesis in recent years and resulted in an increasing number of publications on lipid metabolism in microalgae. In this review we summarize the current findings on genetic, molecular and physiological studies of TAG accumulation in microalgae. Special emphasis is on the functional analysis of key genes involved in TAG synthesis, molecular mechanisms of regulation of TAG biosynthesis, as well as on possible mechanisms of lipid droplet formation in microalgal cells.

Abstract: We have previously identified a deletion mutant of human apoB [apoB (Thr26_Tyr27del)] in a subject with primary hypobetalipoproteinemia. The present study determined the effect of Thr26_Tyr27del mutation on apoB secretion using transfected McA-RH7777 cells. Transient or stable transfection of apoB-48 containing the Thr26_Tyr27del mutation showed drastically reduced secretion of the mutant as compared to wild-type apoB-48. No lipoproteins containing the mutant apoB-48 were secreted into the medium. Incubation of transfected cells in a lipid-rich medium in the presence of cycloheximide showed rapid turnover of cell-associated mutant apoB-48 as compared to that of wild-type apoB-48. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that the mutant apoB-48 was mostly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 markedly attenuated the turnover of cell-associated mutant apoB-48, whereas treatment with inhibitors of autophagosomal/lysosomal function (e.g. 3-MA or ammonium chloride) had no effect. Taken together, these results indicated that the defective secretion of the Thr26_Tyr27del mutant was associated with increased intracellular degradation of apoB through the proteasome-dependent pathway.

Abstract: MicroRNAs are key regulators of β-cell physiology. They participate to the differentiation of insulin-producing cells and are instrumental for the acquisition of their unique secretory properties. Moreover, they contribute to the adaptation of β-cells to conditions of increased insulin demand and, if expressed at inappropriate levels, certain microRNAs cause β-cell dysfunction and promote the development of different forms of diabetes mellitus. While these functions are increasingly better understood, additional tasks for these small non-coding RNAs have been recently unveiled. Thus, microRNAs are emerging as signaling molecules of a novel exosome-mediated cell-to-cell communication mode permitting a coordinated response of the β-cells to inflammatory conditions and to modifications in the insulin demand. These discoveries raise a number of important issues that once addressed promise to shed new light on the molecular mechanism governing the functions of the β-cells under normal and disease states.

Abstract: High density lipoprotein (HDL) and its main protein component apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) have multiple anti-atherogenic functions. Some of them are exerted within the vessel wall, so that HDL needs to pass the endothelial barrier. To elucidate their itinerary through endothelial cells (ECs), we labelled ApoA-I and HDL either fluorescently or with 1.4nm nanogold and investigated their cellular localization by using immunofluorescent microscopy (IFM) and electron microscopy (EM). HDL as well as ApoA-I is taken up by ECs into the same route of intracellular trafficking. Time kinetics and pulse chase experiments revealed that HDL is trafficked through different vesicles. HDL partially co-localized with LDL, albumin, and transferrin. HDL did not co-localize with clathrin and caveolin-1. Fluorescent HDL was recovered at small proportions in early endosomes and endosome to trans-golgi network vesicles but not at all in recycling endosomes, in late endosomes or lysosomes. EM identified HDL mainly in large filled vesicles which however upon IFM did not colocalize with markers of multivesicular bodies or autophagosomes. The uptake or cellular distribution of HDL was altered upon pharmacological interference with cytochalasine D, colchicine and dynasore. Blockage of fluid phase uptake with Amiloride or EIPA did not reduce the uptake of HDL. Neither did we observe any co-localization of HDL with dextran as the marker of fluid phase uptake. In conclusion, HDL and ApoA-I are internalized and trafficked by endothelial cells through a non-classical endocytic route.

Abstract: Ces1g/Es-x deficiency in mice results in weight gain, insulin resistance, fatty liver and hyperlipidemia through upregulation of de novo lipogenesis and oversecretion of triacylglycerol (TG)-rich lipoproteins. Here, we show that restoration of Ces1g/Es-x expression only in the liver significantly reduced hepatic TG concentration accompanied by decreased size of lipid droplets, reduced secretion of very low-density lipoproteins and improved insulin-mediated signal transduction in the liver. Collectively, these results demonstrate that hepatic Ces1g/Es-x plays a critical role in limiting hepatic steatosis, very low-density lipoprotein assembly and in augmenting insulin sensitivity.

Abstract: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates formation of disc-shaped high-density lipoprotein (HDL) from cell lipid and lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I). Discoidal HDL particles are heterogeneous in physicochemical characteristics for reasons that are understood incompletely. Discoidal lipoprotein particles similar in characteristics and heterogeneity to cell-formed discoidal HDL can be reconstituted from purified lipids and apo A-I by cell-free, physicochemical methods. The heterogeneity of reconstituted HDL (rHDL) is sensitive to the lipid composition of the starting lipid/apo A-I mixture. To determine whether the heterogeneity of cell-formed HDL is similarly sensitive to changes in cell lipids, we investigated four compounds that have well-established effects on cell lipid metabolism and ABCA1-mediated cell cholesterol efflux. 2-Bromopalmitate, D609, monensin and U18666A decreased formation of the larger-sized, but dramatically increased formation of the smaller-sized HDL. 2-Bromopalmitate did not appear to affect ABCA1 activity, subcellular localization or oligomerization, but induced dissolution of the cholesterol-phospholipid complexes in the plasma membrane. Arachidonic and linoleic acids shifted HDL formation to the smaller-sized species. Tangier disease mutations and inhibitors of ABCA1 activity wheat germ agglutinin and AG 490 reduced formation of both larger-sized and smaller-sized HDL. The effect of probucol was similar to the effect of 2-bromopalmitate. Taking rHDL formation as a paradigm, we propose that ABCA1 mutations and activity inhibitors reduce the amount of cell lipid available for HDL formation, and the compounds in the 2-bromopalmitate group and the polyunsaturated fatty acids change cell lipid composition from one that favors formation of the larger-sized HDL particles to one that favors formation of the smaller-sized species.

Abstract: Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the main constituent of mammalian cell membranes. Consequently, preservation of membrane PC content and composition — PC homeostasis — is crucial to maintain cellular life. PC biosynthetic pathway is generally controlled by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), which is considered the rate-limiting enzyme. CCTα is an amphitropic protein, whose enzymatic activity is commonly associated with endoplasmic reticulum redistribution. However, most of the enzyme is located inside the nuclei. Here, we demonstrate that CCTα is the most abundant isoform in renal collecting duct cells, and its redistribution is dependent on endogenous prostaglandins. Previously we have demonstrated that PC synthesis was inhibited by indomethacin (Indo) treatment, and this effect was reverted by exogenous PGD2. In this work we found that Indo induced CCTα distribution into intranuclear Lamin A/C foci. Exogenous PGD2 reverted this effect by inducing CCTα redistribution to nuclear envelope, suggesting that PGD2 maintains PC synthesis by CCTα mobilization. Interestingly, we found that the effect of PGD2 was dependent on ERK1/2 activation. In conclusion, our previous observations and the present results lead us to suggest that papillary cells possess the ability to maintain their structural integrity through the synthesis of their own survival molecule, PGD2, by modulating CCTα intracellular location.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is of major concern in ageing populations and we have used the Tg2576 mouse model to understand connections between brain lipids and amyloid pathology. Because dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been identified as beneficial, we compared mice fed with a DHA-supplemented diet to those on a nutritionally-sufficient diet. Major phospholipids from cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum were separated and analysed. Each phosphoglyceride had a characteristic fatty acid composition which was similar in cortex and hippocampus but different in the cerebellum. The biggest changes on DHA-supplementation were within ethanolamine phospholipids which, together with phosphatidylserine, had the highest proportions of DHA. Reciprocal alterations in DHA and arachidonate were found. The main diet-induced alterations were found in ethanolamine phospholipids, (and included their ether derivatives), as were the changes observed due to genotype. Tg mice appeared more sensitive to diet with generally lower DHA percentages when on the standard diet and higher relative proportions of DHA when the diet was supplemented. All four major phosphoglycerides analysed showed age-dependent decreases in polyunsaturated fatty acid contents. These data provide, for the first time, a detailed evaluation of phospholipids in different brain areas previously shown to be relevant to behaviour in the Tg2576 mouse model for AD. The lipid changes observed with genotype are consistent with the subtle alterations found in AD patients, especially for the ethanolamine phospholipid molecular species. They also emphasise the contrasting changes in fatty acid content induced by DHA supplementation within individual phospholipid classes.

Abstract: Cholesterol oxidation products frequently have a high biological activity. In the present study, we have used microelectrode recording of end plate currents and FM-based optical detection of synaptic vesicle exo-endocytosis to investigate the effects of two structurally similar oxysterols, olesoxime (cholest-4-en-3-one, oxime) and 5ɑ-cholestan-3-one (5ɑCh3), on neurotransmission at the frog neuromuscular junction. Olesoxime is an exogenous, potentially neuroprotective, substance and 5ɑCh3 is an intermediate product in cholesterol metabolism, which is elevated in the case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. We found that olesoxime slightly increased evoked neurotransmitter release in response to a single stimulus and significantly reduced synaptic depression during high frequency activity. The last effect was due to an increase in both the number of synaptic vesicles involved in exo-endocytosis and the rate of synaptic vesicle recycling. In contrast, 5ɑCh3 reduced evoked neurotransmitter release during the low- and high frequency synaptic activities. The depressant action of 5ɑCh3 was associated with a reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles participating in exo- and endocytosis during high frequency stimulation, without a change in rate of the synaptic vesicle recycling. Of note, olesoxime increased the staining of synaptic membranes with the B-subunit of cholera toxin and the formation of fluorescent ganglioside GM1 clusters, and decreased the fluorescence of 22-NBD-cholesterol, while 5ɑCh3 had the opposite effects, suggesting that the two oxysterols have different effects on lipid raft stability. Taken together, these data show that these two structurally similar oxysterols induce marked different changes in neuromuscular transmission which are related with the alteration in synaptic vesicle cycle.

Abstract: A diet rich in n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is cardioprotective. Dietary PUFAs affect the cellular phospholipids composition, which may influence the function of membrane proteins. We investigated the impact of the membrane incorporation of several PUFAs on ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, a key antiatherogenic pathway. Arachidonic acid (AA) (C20:4 n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6 n-3) decreased or increased cholesterol efflux from J774 mouse macrophages, respectively, whereas they had no effect on efflux from human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM). Importantly, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C20:5 n-3) induced a dose-dependent reduction of ABCA1 functionality in both cellular models (−28% for 70μM of EPA in HMDM), without any alterations in ABCA1 expression. These results show that PUFA membrane incorporation does not have the same consequences on cholesterol efflux from mouse and human macrophages. The EPA-treated HMDM exhibited strong phospholipid composition changes, with high levels of both EPA and its elongation product docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (C22:5 n-3), which is associated with a decreased level of AA. In HMDM, EPA reduced the ATPase activity of the membrane transporter. Moreover, the activation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin and the inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase by isobutylmethylxanthine restored ABCA1 cholesterol efflux in EPA-treated human macrophages. In conclusion, EPA membrane incorporation reduces ABCA1 functionality in mouse macrophages as well as in primary human macrophages and this effect seems to be PKA-dependent in human macrophages.

Abstract: Adipose tissue can store over 50% of whole-body cholesterol; however, the physiological role of adipose tissue in cholesterol metabolism and atherogenesis has not been directly assessed. Here, we examined lipoprotein metabolism and atherogenesis in a unique mouse model of severe lipodystrophy: the Seipin−/− mice, and also in mice deficient in both low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) and Seipin: the Ldlr−/−Seipin−/− mice. Plasma cholesterol was moderately increased in the Seipin−/− mice when fed an atherogenic diet. Strikingly, plasma cholesterol reached ~6000mg/dl in the Seipin−/−Ldlr−/− mice on an atherogenic diet, as compared to ~1000mg/dl in the Ldlr−/− mice on the same diet. The Seipin−/−Ldlr−/− mice also developed spontaneous atherosclerosis on chow diet and severe atherosclerosis on an atherogenic diet. Rosiglitazone treatment significantly reduced the hypercholesterolemia of the Seipin−/−Ldlr−/− mice, and also alleviated the severity of atherosclerosis. Our results provide direct evidence, for the first time, that the adipose tissue plays a critical role in the clearance of plasma cholesterol. Our results also reveal a previously unappreciated strong link between adipose tissue and LDLR in plasma cholesterol metabolism.

Abstract: Sapienic acid, 16:1n-10 is the most abundant unsaturated fatty acid on human skin where its synthesis is mediated by FADS2 in the sebaceous glands. The FADS2 product introduces a double bond at the Δ6, Δ4 and Δ8 positions by acting on at least ten substrates, including 16:0, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3. Our aim was to characterize the competition for accessing FADS2 mediated Δ6 desaturation between 16:0 and the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the human diet, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, to evaluate whether competition may be relevant in other tissues and thus linked to metabolic abnormalities associated with FADS2 or fatty acid levels. MCF7 cells stably transformed with FADS2 biosynthesize 16:1n-10 from exogenous 16:0 in preference to 16:1n-7, the immediate product of SCD highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and 16:1n-9 via partial β-oxidation of 18:1n-9. Increasing availability of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 resulted in decreased bioconversion of 16:0 to 16:1n-10, simultaneously increasing the levels of highly unsaturated products. FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo lipogenesis from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids, and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves insulin resistance and other factors related to diabetes and metabolic syndrome aggravated by excess calorie consumption.

Abstract: Glycerophospholipids are the principal fabric of cellular membranes. The pathways by which these lipids are synthesized were elucidated mainly through the work of Kennedy and colleagues in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Subsequently, attention turned to cell biological aspects of lipids: Where in the cell are lipids synthesized? How are lipids integrated into membranes to form a bilayer? How are they sorted and transported from their site of synthesis to other cellular destinations? These topics, collectively termed ‘lipid topogenesis’, were the subject of a review article in 1981 by Bell, Ballas and Coleman. We now assess what has been learned about early events of lipid topogenesis, i.e. “lipid synthesis, the integration of lipids into membranes, and lipid translocation across membranes”, in the 35years since the publication of this important review. We highlight the recent elucidation of the X-ray structures of key membrane enzymes of glycerophospholipid synthesis, progress on identifying lipid scramblase proteins needed to equilibrate lipids across membranes, and new complexities in the subcellular location and membrane topology of phosphatidylinositol synthesis revealed through a comparison of two unicellular model eukaryotes. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: The cellular lipid landscape edited by Tim P. Levine and Anant K. Menon.

Abstract: Brown spider phospholipases D from Loxosceles venoms are among the most widely studied toxins since they induce dermonecrosis, triggering inflammatory responses, increase vascular permeability, cause hemolysis, and renal failure. The catalytic (H12 and H47) and metal-ion binding (E32 and D34) residues in Loxosceles intermedia phospholipase D (LiRecDT1) were mutated to understand their roles in the observed activities. All mutants were identified using whole venom serum antibodies and a specific antibody to wild-type LiRecDT1, they were also analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The phospholipase D activities of H12A, H47A, H12A-H47A, E32, D34 and E32A-D34A, such as vascular permeability, dermonecrosis, and hemolytic effects were inhibited. The mutant Y228A was equally detrimental to biochemical and biological effects of phospholipase D, suggesting an essential role of this residue in substrate recognition and binding. On the other hand, the mutant C53A-C201A reduced the enzyme's ability to hydrolyze phospholipids and promote dermonecrosis, hemolytic, and vascular effects. These results provide the basis understanding the importance of specific residues in the observed activities and contribute to the design of synthetic and specific inhibitors for Brown spider venom phospholipases D.

Abstract: Squalene synthase catalyzes the first committed step in sterol biosynthesis and consists of both an amino-terminal catalytic domain and a carboxy-terminal domain tethering the enzyme to the ER membrane. While the overall architecture of this enzyme is identical in eukaryotes, it was previously shown that plant and animal genes cannot complement a squalene synthase knockout mutation in yeast unless the carboxy-terminal domain is swapped for one of fungal origin. This implied a unique component of the fungal carboxy-terminal domain was responsible for the complementation phenotype. To identify this motif, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a squalene synthase knockout mutation, and expressed intact and chimeric squalene synthases originating from fungi, plants, and animals. In contrast to previous observations, all enzymes tested could partially complement the knockout mutation when the genes were weakly expressed. However, when highly expressed, non-fungal squalene synthases could not complement the yeast mutation and instead led to the accumulation of a toxic intermediate(s) as defined by mutations of genes downstream in the ergosterol pathway. Restoration of the complete complementation phenotype was mapped to a 26-amino acid hinge region linking the catalytic and membrane-spanning domains specific to fungal squalene synthases. Over-expression of the C-terminal domain containing a hinge domain from fungi, not from animals or plants, led to growth inhibition of wild-type yeast. Because this hinge region is unique to and highly conserved within each kingdom of life, the data suggests that the hinge domain plays an essential functional role, such as assembly of ergosterol multi-enzyme complexes in fungi.

d-3-Deoxy-dioctanoylphosphatidylinositol induces cytotoxicity in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells via a mechanism that involves downregulation of the D-type cyclin-retinoblastoma pathway,

Abstract: Phosphatidylinositol analogs (PIAs) were originally designed to bind competitively to the Akt PH domain and prevent membrane translocation and activation. d-3-Deoxy-dioctanoylphosphatidylinositol (d-3-deoxy-diC8PI), but not compounds with altered inositol stereochemistry (e.g., l-3-deoxy-diC8PI and l-3,5-dideoxy-diC8PI), is cytotoxic. However, high resolution NMR field cycling relaxometry shows that both cytotoxic and non-toxic PIAs bind to the Akt1 PH domain at the site occupied by the cytotoxic alkylphospholipid perifosine. This suggests that another mechanism for cytotoxicity must account for the difference in efficacy of the synthetic short-chain PIAs. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with little constitutively active Akt, d-3-deoxy-diC8PI (but not l-compounds) decreases viability concomitant with increased cleavage of PARP and caspase 9, indicative of apoptosis. d-3-Deoxy-diC8PI also induces a decrease in endogenous levels of cyclins D1 and D3 and blocks downstream retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. siRNA-mediated depletion of cyclin D1, but not cyclin D3, reduces MCF-7 cell proliferation. Thus, growth arrest and cytotoxicity induced by the soluble d-3-deoxy-diC8PI occur by a mechanism that involves downregulation of the D-type cyclin-pRb pathway independent of its interaction with Akt. This ability to downregulate D-type cyclins contributes, at least in part, to the anti-proliferative activity of d-3-deoxy-diC8PI and may be a common feature of other cytotoxic phospholipids.

Abstract: Several previous studies indicated that for optimal uptake by the brain, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) should be present as phospholipid in the plasma. However most of dietary DHA is absorbed as triacylglycerol (TAG) because it is released as free fatty acid during digestion of either TAG-DHA (fish oil) or sn-2-DHA phospholipid (krill oil), and subsequently incorporated into TAG of chylomicrons. We tested the hypothesis that the absorption of DHA as phospholipid can be increased if it is present in the sn-1 position of dietary phospholipid or in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), because it would escape the hydrolysis by pancreatic phospholipase A2. We infused micelle containing the DHA either as LPC or as free acid, into the duodenum of lymph cannulated rats, and analyzed the chylomicrons and HDL of the lymph for the DHA-containing lipids. The results show that while the total amount of DHA absorbed was comparable from the two types of micelle, the percentage of DHA recovered in lymph phospholipids was 5 times greater with LPC-DHA, compared to free DHA. Furthermore, the amount of DHA recovered in lymph HDL was increased by 2-fold when LPC-DHA micelle was infused. These results could potentially lead to a novel strategy to increase brain DHA levels through the diet.

Abstract: Aims
Electronegative LDL (LDL(−)) is a plasma LDL subfraction that induces cytokine release in monocytes through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. However, the intracellular pathways induced by LDL(−) downstream TLR4 activation are unknown. We aimed to identify the pathways activated by LDL(−) leading to cytokine release in monocytes.
Methods and results
We determined LDL(−)-induced activation of several intracellular kinases in protein extracts from monocytes using a multikinase ELISA array. LDL(−) induced higher p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation than native LDL. This was corroborated by a specific cell-based assay and it was dependent on TLR4 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3k)/Akt pathway. P38 MAPK activation was involved in cytokine release promoted by LDL(−). A specific ELISA showed that LDL(−) activated cAMP response-element binding (CREB) in a p38 MAPK dependent manner. P38 MAPK was also involved in the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) and activating protein-1 (AP-1) activation by LDL(−). We found that NF-kB, AP-1 and CREB inhibitors decreased LDL(−)-induced cytokine release, mainly on MCP1, IL6 and IL10 release, respectively.
Conclusions
LDL(−) promotes p38 MAPK phosphorylation through TLR4 and PI3k/Akt pathways. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK is involved in NF-kB, AP-1 and CREB activation, leading to LDL(−)-induced cytokine release in monocytes.

Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa expresses a secreted LOX-isoform (PA-LOX, LoxA) capable of oxidizing polyenoic fatty acids to hydroperoxy derivatives. Here we report high-level expression of this enzyme in E. coli and its structural and functional characterization. Recombinant PA-LOX oxygenates polyenoic fatty acids including eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid to the corresponding (n-6)S-hydroperoxy derivatives. This reaction involves abstraction of the proS-hydrogen from the n-8 bisallylic methylene. PA-LOX lacks major leukotriene synthase activity but converts 5S-HETE and 5S,6R/S-DiHETE to anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipoxins. It also exhibits phospholipid oxygenase activity as indicated by the formation of a specific pattern of oxygenation products from different phospholipid subspecies. Multiple mutagenesis studies revealed that PA-LOX does not follow classical concepts explaining the reaction specificity of mammalian LOXs. The crystal structure of PA-LOX was solved with resolutions of up to 1.48Å and its polypeptide chain is folded as single domain. The substrate-binding pocket consists of two fatty acid binding subcavities and lobby. Subcavity-1 contains the catalytic non-heme iron. A phosphatidylethanolamine molecule occupies the substrate-binding pocket and its sn1 fatty acid is located close to the catalytic non-heme iron. His377, His382, His555, Asn559 and the C-terminal Ile685 function as direct iron ligands and a water molecule (hydroxyl) completes the octahedral ligand sphere. Although the biological relevance of PA-LOX is still unknown its functional characteristics (lipoxin synthase activity) implicate this enzyme in a bacterial evasion strategy aimed at downregulating the hosts' immune system.

Abstract: The activation of hepatic kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is implicated in the development of obesity-related metabolic disorders. This study investigated the metabolic sequelae of mTORC1 hyperactivation in human hepatoma cells and the lipid-regulating mechanisms of two short-chain fatty acids: 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and (R)-α-lipoic acid (LA). We created three stable cell lines that exhibit low, normal, or high mTORC1 activity. mTORC1 hyperactivation induced the expression of lipogenic (DGAT1 and DGAT2) and lipoprotein assembly (MTP and APOB) genes, thereby raising cellular triacylglyceride (TG) and exacerbating secretion of apoB-containing TG-rich lipoproteins. LYS6K2, a specific inhibitor of the p70 S6 kinase branch of mTORC1 signaling, reversed these effects. PBA and LA decreased secreted TG through distinct mechanisms. PBA repressed apoB expression (both mRNA and protein) and lowered secreted TG without mitigation of mTORC1 hyperactivity or activation of AMPK. LA decreased cellular and secreted TG by attenuating mTORC1 signaling in an AMPK-independent manner. LA did not regulate apoB expression but led to the secretion of apoB-containing TG-poor lipoproteins by repressing the expression of lipogenic genes, FASN, DGAT1, and DGAT2. Our studies provide new mechanistic insight into the hypolipidemic activity of PBA and LA in the context of mTORC1 hyperactivation and suggest that the short-chain fatty acids may aid in the prevention and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.

Abstract: Dysfunction of lipid metabolism and accumulation of 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DAG) may be a key factor in the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline alkaloid extract that has shown promise as a hypoglycemic agent in the management of diabetes in animal and human studies. However, its mechanism of action is not well understood. To determine the effect of BBR on lipid synthesis and its relationship to insulin resistance in H9c2 cardiomyocytes, we measured neutral lipid and phospholipid synthesis and their relationship to glucose uptake. Compared with controls, BBR treatment stimulated 2-[1,2-3H(N)]deoxy-D-glucose uptake and consumption in palmitate-mediated insulin resistant H9c2 cells. The mechanism was though an increase in protein kinase B (AKT) activity and GLUT-4 glucose transporter expression. DAG accumulated in palmitate-mediated insulin resistant H9c2 cells and treatment with BBR reduced this DAG accumulation and increased accumulation of 1,2,3-triacyl-sn-glycerol (TAG) compared to controls. Treatment of palmitate-mediated insulin resistant H9c2 cells with BBR increased [1,3-3H]glycerol and [1-14C]glucose incorporation into TAG and reduced their incorporation into DAG compared to control. In addition, BBR treatment of these cells increased [1-14C]palmitic acid incorporation into TAG and decreased its incorporation into DAG compared to controls. BBR treatment did not alter phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis. The mechanism for the BBR-mediated decreased precursor incorporation into DAG and increased incorporation into TAG in palmitate-incubated cells was an increase in DAG acyltransferase-2 activity and its expression and a decrease in TAG hydrolysis. Thus, BBR treatment attenuates palmitate-induced reduction in glucose uptake and consumption, in part, through reduction in cellular DAG levels and accumulation of TAG in H9c2 cells.

Abstract: Analysis of polar lipids from eight psychrophilic yeasts (Cryptococcus victoriae, Cystofilobasidium capitatum, Holtermaniella wattica, Mrakiella aquatica, M. cryoconiti, Rhodotorula lignophila, Kondoa malvinella and Trichosporon aggtelekiense) grown at 4–28°C by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography/high resolution electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry determined 17 classes of lipids and identified dozens of molecular species of phospholipids including their regioisomers. Most of the yeasts were able to grow over the whole temperature range, reaching the highest biomass at 4 or 10°C. On temperature drop to 4°C, all eight strains showed a significant decrease of MUFA and a simultaneous increase of PUFA such as α-linolenic acid, the content of which in the biomass reached up to 20%. We also found alterations in the proportions of individual phospholipids (PI, PE and PC), the PC/PE-ratio decreasing with decreasing temperature. With increasing temperature the content of PoO-PC rose while that of LL-PC decreased, the drop in the content of LL-PC being nearly 100-fold while the content of PoO-PC increased more than twice. A change in temperature brought about changes in molecular species of PC (molecular species PO-PC versus OP-PC) as well as PE, i.e. PO-PE and OP-PE. The phase transition temperature of PO-PC differs from OP-PC by 7°C and the difference between PO-PE and OP-PE is some 10°C; we thus assume that the cell compensates for the adverse temperature effect by changing the fatty acids in the sn-1 and sn-2 positions.

Abstract: Acyl CoA:2-monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT)-2 has an important role in dietary fat absorption in the intestine. MGAT2 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and catalyzes the synthesis of diacylglycerol which is then utilized as a substrate for triacylglycerol synthesis. This triacylglycerol is then incorporated into chylomicrons which are released into the circulation. In this study, we determined the membrane topology of human MGAT2. Protease protection experiments showed that the C-terminus is exposed to the cytosol, while the N-terminus is partially buried in the ER membrane. MGAT2, like murine DGAT2, was found to have two transmembrane domains. We also identified a region of MGAT2 associated with the ER membrane that contains the histidine–proline–histidine–glycine sequence present in all DGAT2 family members that is thought to comprise the active site. Proteolysis experiments demonstrated that digestion of total cellular membranes from cells expressing MGAT2 with trypsin abolished MGAT activity, indicating that domains that are important for catalysis face the cytosol. We also explored the role that the five cysteines residues present in MGAT2 have in catalysis. MGAT activity was sensitive to two thiol modifiers, N-ethylmaleimide and 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Furthermore, mutation of four cysteines resulted in a reduction in MGAT activity. However, when the C-terminal cysteine (C334) was mutated, MGAT activity was actually higher than that of wild-type FL-MGAT2. Lastly, we determined that both transmembrane domains of MGAT2 are important for its ER localization, and that MGAT2 is present in mitochondrial-associated membranes.

Abstract: The oxidized phospholipids (oxPl) 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PGPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC) are cytotoxic components of oxidized LDL (oxLDL). Sustained exposure to oxLDL or isolated oxPl induces apoptotic signaling in vascular cells, which is a hallmark of the late phase of atherosclerosis. Activation of sphingomyelinase, the coordinate formation of ceramide and activation of caspase 3/7 as well as the activation of stress-associated kinases are causally involved in this process. Here, we provide evidence for a role of PKCδ in oxPl cytotoxicity. Silencing of the enzyme by siRNA significantly reduced caspase 3/7 activation in RAW 264.7 macrophages under the influence of oxPl. Concomitantly, PKCδ was phosphorylated as a consequence of cell exposure to PGPC or POVPC. Single molecule fluorescence microscopy provided direct evidence for oxPl-protein interaction. Both oxPl recruited an RFP-tagged PKCδ to the plasma membrane in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, two color cross-correlation number and brightness (ccN&B) analysis of the molecular motions revealed that fluorescently labeled PGPC or POVPC analogs co-diffuse and are associated with the fluorescent protein kinase in live cells. The underlying lipid-protein interactions may be due to chemical bonding (imine formation between the phospholipid aldehyde POVPC with protein amino groups) and physical association (with POVPC or PGPC). In summary, our data supports the assumption that PKCδ acts as a proapototic kinase in oxPl-included apoptosis of RAW 264.7 macrophages. The direct association of the bioactive lipids with this enzyme seems to be an important step in the early phase of apoptotic signaling.

Abstract: MicroRNAs have been described as important regulators of skeletal muscle differentiation and development, but the role of microRNAs in glucose and lipid metabolism is less well established. Here we review the microRNAs involved in insulin resistance and glucose metabolism, as well as microRNAs regulating lipid metabolism and mitochondrial functions in skeletal muscle, with an emphasis on metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and the adaptive response to exercise training. Finally, we raise some methodological considerations for studying microRNAs, as well as challenges investigators may face when elucidating the direct role of microRNAs in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle.

Abstract: Sphingolipid metabolites have emerged playing important roles in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, whereas the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In the present study, we provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence showing a pathogenic role of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) in hepatocellular steatosis. We found that levels of SphK1 expression were significantly increased in steatotic hepatocytes. Enforced overexpression of SphK1 or treatment with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) markedly enhanced hepatic lipid accumulation. In contrast, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of SphK1 or S1P receptors, S1P2 and S1P3, profoundly inhibited lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Moreover, Sphk1−/− mice exhibited a significant amelioration of hepatosteatosis under diet-induced obese (DIO) conditions, compared to wild-type littermates. In addition, DIO-induced up-regulation of PPARγ and its target genes were significantly reduced by SphK1 deficiency. Furthermore, treatment of hepatocytes with S1P induces a dose-dependent increase in PPARγ expression at the transcriptional level. Blockage of S1P receptors and the Akt-mTOR signaling profoundly inhibited S1P-induced PPARγ expression. Notably, down-regulation of PPARγ by using its siRNA significantly diminished the pro-steatotic effect of SphK1/S1P. Thus, the study demonstrates a new pathway connecting SphK1 and PPARγ involved in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular steatosis.

Abstract: Objective
Oxidised low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) contributes to atherosclerosis, whereas high density lipoprotein (HDL) is known to be atheroprotective due, at least in part, to its ability to remove oxidised lipids from oxLDL. The molecular details of the lipid transfer process are not fully understood. We aimed to identify major oxidised lipid species of oxLDL and investigate their transfer upon co-incubation with HDL with varying levels of oxidation.
Approach and results
A total of 14 major species of oxidised phosphatidylcholine and oxidised cholesteryl ester from oxLDL were identified using an untargeted mass spectrometry approach. HDL obtained from pooled plasma of normolipidemic subjects (N=5) was oxidised under mild and heavy oxidative conditions. Non-oxidised (native) HDL and oxidised HDL were co-incubated with oxLDL, re-isolated and lipidomic analysis was performed. Lipoprotein surface lipids, oxidised phosphatidylcholines and oxidised cholesterols (7-ketocholesterol and 7β-hydroxycholesterol), but not internal oxidised cholesteryl esters, were effectively transferred to native HDL. Saturated and monounsaturated lyso-phosphatidylcholines were also transferred from the oxLDL to native HDL. These processes were attenuated when HDL was oxidised under mild and heavy oxidative conditions. The impaired capacities were accompanied by an increase in a ratio of sphingomyelin to phosphatidylcholine and a reduction in phosphatidylserine content in oxidised HDL, both of which are potentially important regulators of the oxidised lipid transfer capacity of HDL.
Conclusions
Our study has revealed the differential transfer efficiency of surface and internal oxidised lipids from oxLDL and their acceptance onto HDL. These capacities were modulated when HDL was itself oxidised.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic disease characterized by accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. Enhanced release of non-esterified fatty acids from adipose tissue accounts for a remarkable fraction of accumulated lipids. However, the de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is also implicated in the etiology of the NAFLD. Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1 (SREBP-1) is a transcription factor modulating the expression of several lipogenic enzymes. In the present study, in order to investigate the effect of lipid droplet accumulation on DNL, we used a cellular model of steatosis represented by HepG2 cells cultured in a medium supplemented with free oleic and palmitic fatty acids (FFAs). We report that FFA supplementation induces the expression of genes coding for enzymes involved in the DNL as well as for the transcription factor SREBP-1a. The SREBP-1a mRNA translation, dependent on an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and the SREBP-1a proteolytic cleavage are activated by FFAs. Furthermore, FFA treatment enhances the expression and the nucleus-cytosolic shuttling of hnRNP A1, a trans-activating factor of SREBP-1a IRES. The binding of hnRNP A1 to the SREBP-1a IRES is also increased upon FFA supplementation. The relocation of hnRNP A1 and the consequent increase of SREBP-1a translation are dependent on the p38 MAPK signal pathway, which is activated by FFAs. By RNA interference approach, we demonstrate that hnRNP A1 is implicated in the FFA-induced expression of SREBP-1a and of its target genes as well as in the lipid accumulation in cells.

Abstract: Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant phospholipid in intestinal mucus, indicative of a specific transport system across the mucosal epithelium to the intestinal lumen. To elucidate this transport mechanism, we employed a transwell tissue culture system with polarized CaCo2 cells. It was shown that PC could not substantially be internalized by the cells. However, after basal application of increasing PC concentrations, an apical transport of 47.1±6.3nmolh−1mMPC−1 was observed. Equilibrium distribution studies with PC applied in equal concentrations to the basal and apical compartments showed a 1.5-fold accumulation on the expense of basal PC. Disruption of tight junctions (TJ) by acetaldehyde or PPARγ inhibitors or by treatment with siRNA to TJ proteins suppressed paracellular transport by at least 50%. Transport was specific for the choline containing the phospholipids PC, lysoPC and sphingomyelin. We showed that translocation is driven by an electrochemical gradient generated by apical accumulation of Cl− and HCO3− through CFTR. Pretreatment with siRNA to mucin 3 which anchors in the apical plasma membrane of mucosal cells inhibited the final step of luminal PC secretion. PC accumulates in intestinal mucus using a paracellular, apically directed transport route across TJs.

Abstract: The vacuoles play important roles in cellular homeostasis and their functions include the digestion of cytoplasmic material and organelles derived from autophagy. Conserved nutrient signaling pathways regulate vacuolar function and autophagy, ensuring normal cell and organismal development and aging. Recent evidence implicates sphingolipids in the modulation of these processes, but the impact of ceramide signaling on vacuolar dynamics and autophagy remains largely unknown. Here, we show that yeast cells lacking Isc1p, an orthologue of mammalian neutral sphingomyelinase type 2, exhibit vacuolar fragmentation and dysfunctions, namely decreased Pep4p-mediated proteolysis and V-ATPase activity, which impairs vacuolar acidification. Moreover, these phenotypes are suppressed by downregulation of the ceramide-activated protein phosphatase Sit4p. The isc1Δ cells also exhibit defective Cvt and vesicular trafficking in a Sit4p-dependent manner, ultimately contributing to a reduced autophagic flux. Importantly, these phenotypes are also suppressed by downregulation of the nutrient signaling kinase TORC1, which is known to inhibit Sit4p and autophagy, or Sch9p. These results support a model in which Sit4p functions downstream of Isc1p in a TORC1-independent, ceramide-dependent signaling branch that impairs vacuolar function and vesicular trafficking, leading to autophagic defects in yeast.

Abstract: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) aggregation is central in triggering atherogenesis. A minor fraction of electronegative plasma LDL, termed LDL(−), plays a special role in atherogenesis. To better understand this role, we analyzed the kinetics of aggregation, fusion and disintegration of human LDL and its fractions, LDL(+) and LDL(−). Thermal denaturation of LDL was monitored by spectroscopy and electron microscopy. Initially, LDL(−) aggregated and fused faster than LDL(+), but later the order reversed. Most LDL(+) disintegrated and precipitated upon prolonged heating. In contrast, LDL(−) partially retained lipoprotein morphology and formed soluble aggregates. Biochemical analysis of all fractions showed no significant degradation of major lipids, mild phospholipid oxidation, and an increase in non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) upon thermal denaturation. The main baseline difference between LDL subfractions was higher content of NEFA in LDL(−). Since NEFA promote lipoprotein fusion, increased NEFA content can explain rapid initial aggregation and fusion of LDL(−) but not its resistance to extensive disintegration. Partial hydrolysis of apoB upon heating was similar in LDL subfractions, suggesting that minor proteins importantly modulate LDL disintegration. Unlike LDL(+), LDL(−) contains small amounts of apoA-I and apoJ. Addition of exogenous apoA-I to LDL(+) hampered lipoprotein aggregation, fusion and precipitation, while depletion of endogenous apoJ had an opposite effect. Therefore, the initial rapid aggregation of LDL(−) is apparently counterbalanced by the stabilizing effects of minor proteins such as apoA-I and apoJ. These results help identify key determinants for LDL aggregation, fusion and coalescence into lipid droplets in vivo.

Abstract: Altered lipoprotein metabolism plays a key role during atherogenesis. For over 50years, epidemiological data have fueled the proposal that HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) in circulation is inversely correlated to cardiovascular risk. However, the atheroprotective role of HDL is currently the focus of much debate and remains an active field of research. The emerging picture from research in the past decade suggests that HDL function, rather than HDL-c content, is important in disease. Recent developments demonstrate that miRNAs play an important role in fine-tuning the expression of key genes involved in HDL biogenesis, lipidation, and clearance, as well as in determining the amounts of HDL-c in circulation. Thus, it has been proposed that miRNAs that affect HDL metabolism might be exploited therapeutically in patients. Whether HDL-based therapies, alone or in combination with LDL-based treatments (e.g. statins), provide superior outcomes in patients has been recently questioned by human genetics studies and clinical trials. The switch in focus from “HDL-cholesterol” to “HDL function” opens a new paradigm to understand the physiology and therapeutic potential of HDL, and to find novel modulators of cardiovascular risk. In this review we summarize the current knowledge on the regulation of HDL metabolism and function by miRNAs.

Abstract: In yeast, β-oxidation of fatty acids (FAs) essentially takes place in peroxisomes, and FA activation must precede FA oxidation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a single fatty-acyl–CoA-synthetase, ScFaa2p, mediates peroxisomal FA activation. We have previously shown that this reaction also exists in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica; however, the protein involved in this process remains unknown. Here, we found that proteins, named Aal proteins (Acyl/Aryl-CoA-ligases), resembling the 4-coumarate–CoA-ligase-like enzymes found in plants are involved in peroxisomal FA activation in Y. lipolytica; Y. lipolytica has 10 AAL genes, eight of which are upregulated by oleate. All the Aal proteins contain a PTS1-type peroxisomal targeting sequence (A/SKL), suggesting a peroxisomal localization. The function of the Aal proteins was analyzed using the faa1Δant1Δ mutant strain, which demonstrates neither cytoplasmic FA activation (direct result of FAA1 deletion) nor peroxisomal FA activation (indirect result of ANT1 deletion, a gene coding an ATP transporter). This strain is thus highly sensitive to external FA levels and unable to store external FAs in lipid bodies (LBs). Whereas the overexpression of (cytoplasmic) AAL1ΔPTS1 was able to partially complement the growth defect observed in the faa1Δant1Δ mutant on short-, medium- and long-chain FA media, the presence of Aal2p to Aal10p only allowed growth on the short-chain FA medium. Additionally, partial LB formation was observed in the oleate medium for strains overexpressing Aal1ΔPTS1p, Aal4ΔPTS1p, Aal7ΔPTS1p, and Aal8ΔPTS1p. Finally, an analysis of the FA content of cells grown in the oleate medium suggested that Aal4p and Aal6p present substrate specificity for C16:1 and/or C18:0.

Abstract: Recent advances in membrane contact site (MCS) biology have revealed key roles for MCSs in inter-organellar exchange, the importance of which is becoming increasingly apparent. Roles for MCSs in many essential physiological processes including lipid transfer, calcium exchange, receptor tyrosine kinase signalling, lipid droplet formation, autophagosome formation, organelle dynamics and neurite outgrowth have been reported. The ER forms an extensive and dynamic network of MCSs with a diverse range of functionally distinct organelles. MCSs between the ER and endocytic pathway are particularly abundant, suggesting important physiological roles. Here, our current knowledge of the formation and function of ER contact sites with endocytic organelles from studies in mammalian systems is reviewed. Their relatively poorly defined molecular composition and recently identified functions are discussed. In addition, likely, but yet to be established, roles for these contacts in lipid transfer and calcium signalling are considered.

Abstract: The genome of Aspergillus niger codes for a fusion protein (EHA25900), which can be aligned with ~50% sequence identity to 9S-dioxygenase (DOX)-allene oxide synthase (AOS) of Fusarium oxysporum, homologues of the Fusarium and Colletotrichum complexes and with over 62% sequence identity to homologues of Aspergilli, including (DOX)-9R-AOS of Aspergillus terreus. The aims were to characterize the enzymatic activities of EHA25900 and to identify crucial amino acids for the stereospecificity. Recombinant EHA25900 oxidized 18:2n-6 sequentially to 9R-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9R-HPODE) and to a 9R(10)-allene oxide. 9S- and 9R-DOX-AOS catalyze abstraction of the pro-R hydrogen at C-11, but the direction of oxygen insertion differs. A comparison between twelve 9-DOX domains of 9S- and 9R-DOX-AOS revealed conserved amino acid differences, which could contribute to the chirality of products. The Gly616Ile replacement of 9R-DOX-AOS (A. niger) increased the biosynthesis of 9S-HPODE and the 9S(10)-allene oxide, whereas the Phe627Leu replacement led to biosynthesis of 9S-HPODE and the 9S(10)-allene oxide as main products. The double mutant (Gly616Ile, Phe627Leu) formed over 90% of the 9S stereoisomer of HPODE. 9S-HPODE was formed by antarafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion, i.e., the original H-abstraction was retained but the product chirality was altered. We conclude that 9R-DOX-AOS can be altered to 9S-DOX-AOS by replacement of two amino acids (Gly616Ile, Phe627Leu) in the DOX domain.

Abstract: The discovery of endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) in the early 1990s has been followed by the identification of hundreds of miRNAs and their roles in regulating various biological processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis and viral infection Esteller (2011), Ameres and Zamore (2013) [1], [2]. miRNAs are small (~22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that function as “rheostats” to simultaneously tweak the expression of multiple genes within a genetic network, resulting in dramatic functional modulation of biological processes. Although the last decade has brought the identification of miRNAs, their targets and function(s) in health and disease, there remains much to be deciphered from the human genome and its complexities in mechanistic regulation of entire genetic networks. These discoveries have opened the door to new and exciting avenues for therapeutic interventions to treat various pathological diseases, including cardiometabolic diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes and obesity. In a complex multi-factorial disease like atherosclerosis, many miRNAs have been shown to contribute to disease progression and may offer novel targets for future therapy.

Abstract: Obesity and metabolic disorders are a major health concern in all developed countries and a primary focus of current medical research is to improve our understanding treatment of metabolic diseases. One avenue of research that has attracted a great deal of recent interest focuses upon understanding the role of miRNAs in the development of metabolic diseases. miRNAs have been shown to be dysregulated in a number of different tissues under conditions of obesity and insulin resistance, and have been demonstrated to be important regulators of a number of critical metabolic functions, including insulin secretion in the pancreas, lipid and glucose metabolism in the liver, and nutrient signaling in the hypothalamus. In this review we will focus on the important role of miRNAs in regulating the differentiation and function of white and brown adipose tissue and the potential importance of this for maintaining metabolic function and treating metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Background
Trans-10, cis-12 (t10-c12) CLA treatment reduces lipid accumulation in differentiating mouse and human adipocytes, and decreases fat mass in mice, yet the mechanism of action remains unknown.
Objective
This study investigated the effect of the cis-9, trans-11 (c9-t11) and t10-c12 CLA isomers on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which has been reported to inhibit adipogenesis by down-regulating PPARγ.
Results
We observed that t10-c12 CLA treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes increases the levels of β-catenin and Ser-675 phosphorylated β-catenin due to inhibition of its degradation. These changes in β-catenin were not linked to either the Wnt/β-catenin agonist Wnt10b or other upstream effectors such as SFRP-5. Paradoxically, the presence of higher amounts of β-catenin did not elevate cyclin D1 levels, which is recognized as a critical target gene. Neither of the CLA isomers affected the localization of β-catenin in the cytosol and nucleus as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. However, subcellular fractionation suggested the level of cytosolic β-catenin was reduced in t10-c12 CLA treated cells. Immunoprecipitation revealed that t10-c12 CLA increased the interaction of β-catenin and PPARγ.
Conclusions
t10-c12-CLA inhibits adipocyte differentiation by increasing β-catenin stability in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, thus enhancing sequestration of PPARγ in an inactive complex, which prevents progression of adipogenesis.

Abstract: Taxanes can induce drug resistance by increasing signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt and ERK, which promote survival and cell growth in human cancer cells. We have previously shown that long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) decrease resistance of experimental mammary tumors to anticancer drugs. Our objective was to determine whether DHA could increase tumor sensitivity to docetaxel by down-regulating these survival pathways. In docetaxel-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, phosphorylated-ERK1/2 levels were increased by 60% in membrane and nuclear compartments, compared to untreated cells. Our data showed that ERK1/2 activation depended on PKC activation since: i) enzastaurin (a pan-PKC inhibitor) blocked docetaxel-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation ii) docetaxel increased PKC activity by 30% and phosphatidic acid level by 1.6-fold iii) inhibition of PKCε and PKCδ by siRNA resulted in reduced phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels. In DHA-supplemented cells, docetaxel was unable to increase PKCε and δ levels in membrane and nuclear fractions, resulting in diminished ERK1/2 phosphorylation and increased docetaxel efficacy. Reduced membrane level of PKCε and PKCδ was associated with significant incorporation of DHA in all phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine which is a major source of phosphatidic acid. Additionally, examination of the Akt pathway showed that DHA could repress docetaxel-induced Ser473Akt phosphorylation. In rat mammary tumors, dietary DHA supplementation during docetaxel chemotherapy repressed ERK and Akt survival pathways and in turn strongly improved taxane efficacy. The P-ERK level was negatively correlated with tumor regression. These findings are of potential clinical importance in treating chemotherapy-refractory cancer.

Abstract: The content and composition of cardiolipin (CL) is critical for preservation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and inner membrane integrity. Tafazzin (Taz) is an enzyme responsible for remodeling of immature CL containing mixed acyl groups into the mature tetralinoleyl form (C18:2)4-CL. We hypothesized that acquired defects in Taz in the mature heart would impact remodeling of CL and augment cardiac injury. The role of acquired Taz deficiency was studied using the inducible Taz knockdown (TazKD) mouse. Taz-specific shRNA is induced by doxycycline (DOX). One day of DOX intake decreased Taz mRNA in the heart to 20% vs. DOX-treated WT. Knockdown was initiated at an adult age and was stable during long term feeding. CL phenotype was assessed by (C18:2)4-CL content and was reduced 40% vs. WT at two months of DOX. TazKD showed increased production of reactive oxygen species and increased susceptibility to permeability transition pore opening at baseline. However, OXPHOS measured using the rate of oxygen consumption was unchanged in the setting of acquired Taz deficiency. Infarct size, measured in isolated buffer-perfused Langendorff hearts following 25min. Stop flow ischemia and 60min. Reperfusion was not altered in TazKD hearts. Thus, impaired Taz-function with onset at adult age does not enhance susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Abstract: Background/Aims
Vitamin A and its metabolites are known to regulate lipid metabolism. However so far, no study has assessed, whether vitamin A deficiency per se aggravates or attenuates the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Therefore, here, we tested the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the development of NAFLD.
Methods
Male weanling Wistar rats were fed one of the following diets; control, vitamin A-deficient (VAD), high fructose (HFr) and VAD with HFr (VADHFr) of AIN93G composition, for 16weeks, except half of the VAD diet-fed rats were shifted to HFr diet (VAD(s)HFr), at the end of 8th week.
Results
Animals fed on VAD diet with HFr displayed hypotriglyceridemia (33.5mg/dL) with attenuated hepatic triglyceride accumulation (8.2mg/g), compared with HFr diet (89.5mg/dL and 20.6mg/g respectively). These changes could be partly explained by the decreased activity of glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) and the down-regulation of stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), both at gene and protein levels, the key determinants of triglyceride biosynthesis. On the other hand, n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid and its active metabolite; resolvin D1 (RvD1) levels were elevated in the liver and plasma of VAD diet-fed groups, which was negatively associated with triglyceride levels. All these factors confer vitamin A deficiency-mediated protection against the development of hepatic steatosis, which was also evident from the group shifted from VAD to HFr diet.
Conclusions
Vitamin A deficiency attenuates high fructose-induced hepatic steatosis, by regulating triglyceride synthesis, possibly through GPDH, SCD1 and RvD1.

Abstract: Lipoprotein X (Lp-X) is an abnormal lipoprotein that may typically be formed in intra- and extrahepatic cholestasis and potentially interfere with lipid analysis in the routine lab. To gain insight into lipid class and species composition, Lp-X, LDL and HDL from cholestatic and control serum samples were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis including phospholipids (PL), sphingolipids, free cholesterol (FC), cholesteryl esters (CE) and bile acids. Our analysis of Lp-X revealed a content of 46% FC, 49% PL with 34% phosphatidylcholine (PC) as main PL component. The lipid species pattern of Lp-X showed remarkable high fractions of mono-unsaturated species including PC 32:1 and PC 34:1 and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) 32:1 and 34:1. LDL and HDL lipid composition in the same specimens strongly reflected the lipid composition of Lp-X with increased PC 32:1, PC 34:1, PE 32:1, PE 34:1 and FC accompanied by decreased CE compared to controls. Comparison of Lp-X and biliary lipid composition clearly indicates that Lp-X does not originate from a sole release of bile lipids. Moreover, these data present evidence for increased hepatic fatty acid and PL synthesis which may represent a reaction to high hepatic FC level observed during cholestasis.

Abstract: A mismatch between fatty acid availability and utilization leads to cellular/organ dysfunction during cardiometabolic disease states (e.g., obesity, diabetes mellitus). This can precipitate cardiac dysfunction. The heart adapts to increased fatty acid availability at transcriptional, translational, post-translational and metabolic levels, thereby attenuating cardiomyopathy development. We have previously reported that the cardiomyocyte circadian clock regulates transcriptional responsiveness of the heart to acute increases in fatty acid availability (e.g., short-term fasting). The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the cardiomyocyte circadian clock plays a role in adaptation of the heart to chronic elevations in fatty acid availability. Fatty acid availability was increased in cardiomyocyte-specific CLOCK mutant (CCM) and wild-type (WT) littermate mice for 9weeks in time-of-day-independent (streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetes) and dependent (high fat diet meal feeding) manners. Indices of myocardial metabolic adaptation (e.g., substrate reliance perturbations) to STZ-induced diabetes and high fat meal feeding were found to be dependent on genotype. Various transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms were investigated, revealing that Cte1 mRNA induction in the heart during STZ-induced diabetes is attenuated in CCM hearts. At the functional level, time-of-day-dependent high fat meal feeding tended to influence cardiac function to a greater extent in WT versus CCM mice. Collectively, these data suggest that CLOCK (a circadian clock component) is important for metabolic adaption of the heart to prolonged elevations in fatty acid availability.

Abstract: Increased synthesis of hyaluronic acid (HA) is often associated with increased metastatic potential and invasivity of tumor cells. 4-Methylumbelliferone (MU) is an inhibitor of HA synthesis, and has been studied as a potential anti-tumor drug to inhibit the growth of primary tumors and distant metastasis of tumor cells. Although several studies reported that the anticancer effects of MU are mediated by inhibition of HA signaling, the mechanism still needs to be clarified. In a previous study we demonstrated the regulation of HA synthesis by ceramide, and now show how MU activated neutral sphingomyelinase2 (NSMase2) generates ceramides and mediates MU induced inhibition of HA synthesis, cell migration and invasion, and apoptosis of tumor cells. Using a HA enriched mouse oligodendroglioma cell line G26-24 we found that MU elevated the activity of NSMase2 and increased ceramide levels, which in turn increased phosphatase PP2A activity. Further, the activated PP2A reduced phosphorylation of Akt, decreased activities of HA synthase2 (HAS2) and calpains, and inhibited both the synthesis of HA, and the migration and invasion of G26-24 tumor cells. In addition, MU mediated ceramide stimulated activation of p53 and caspase-3, reduced SIRT1 expression and decreased G26-24 viability. The mechanism of the MU anticancer therefore initially involves NSMase2/ceramide/PP2A/AKT/HAS2/caspase-3/p53/SIRT1 and the calpain signaling pathway, suggesting that ceramides play a key role in the ability of a tumor to become aggressively metastatic and grow.

Distinct mechanisms underlying cholesterol protection against alcohol-induced BK channel inhibition and resulting vasoconstriction,

Abstract: Alcohol (ethanol) at concentrations reached in blood following moderate to heavy drinking (30–80mM) reduces cerebral artery diameter via inhibition of voltage- and calcium-gated potassium channels of large conductance (BK) in cerebral artery smooth muscle. These channels consist of channel-forming α and regulatory β1 subunits. A high-cholesterol diet protects against ethanol-induced constriction via accumulation of cholesterol within the vasculature. The molecular mechanisms of this protection remain unknown. In the present work, we demonstrate that in vitro cholesterol enrichment of rat middle cerebral arteries significantly increased cholesterol within arterial tissues and blunted constriction by 50mM of ethanol. Ethanol-induced BK channel inhibition in inside-out patches excised from freshly isolated cerebral artery myocytes was also abolished by cholesterol enrichment. Enrichment of arteries with enantiomeric cholesterol (ent-cholesterol) also blunted BK channel inhibition and cerebral artery constriction in response to ethanol. The similar protection of cholesterol and ent-cholesterol against ethanol action indicates that this protection does not require protein site(s) that specifically sense natural cholesterol. Cholesterol-driven protection against ethanol-induced BK channel inhibition and vasoconstriction was replicated in myocytes and middle cerebral arteries of C57BL/6 mice. BK β1 subunits are known to regulate vascular diameter and its modification by ethanol. However, blunting of an ethanol effect by in vitro cholesterol enrichment was observed in arteries and myocyte membrane patches from BK β1 (KCNMB1) knockout mice. Thus, BK β1 subunits are not needed for cholesterol protection against ethanol effect on BK channel function and cerebral artery diameter.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and have been implicated in many pathological conditions. Significant progress has been made to unveil their role in lipid metabolism. This review aims at summarizing the role of different miRs that regulate hepatic assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins. Overproduction and/or impaired clearance of these lipoproteins from circulation increase plasma concentrations of lipids enhancing risk for cardiovascular disease. So far, three miRs, miR-122, miR-34a, and miR-30c have been shown to modulate hepatic production of apoB-containing low density lipoproteins. In this review, we will first provide a brief overview of lipid metabolism and apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly to orient readers to different steps that have been shown to be regulated by miRs. Then, we will discuss the role of each miR on plasma lipids and atherosclerotic burden. Furthermore, we will summarize mechanistic studies explaining how these miRs regulate hepatic lipid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and lipoprotein secretion. Finally, we will briefly highlight the potential use of each miR as a therapeutic drug for treating cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is an intracellular neutral lipase capable of hydrolyzing acylglycerols, as well as cholesteryl and retinyl esters. In mice, HSL deficiency results in male sterility. Lipid rafts, a plasma membrane microdomain enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids and saturated glycerophospholipids, comprise a highly dynamic clustering of proteins and lipids that play a central role in signal transduction and intercellular communication. In the present work, we examined the effect of HSL deficiency in the lipid composition of plasma membrane microdomains in mouse testis. The lack of HSL affected the density of lipid rafts, as indicated by the shifting of caveolin 1 to denser fractions in the sucrose-gradient fractionation, and altered the sterol and phospholipid composition of both lipid raft and non-raft fractions, the biochemical differences among them being less obvious in HSL−/− than in HSL+/+ mice. Compared to HSL+/+, the lipid rafts from HSL−/− mice had significantly less desmosterol and T-MAS, while the non-raft domain had increased cholesterol content. Lipid rafts from HSL−/− mice had reduced PUFA-containing phospholipid species but increased phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine species with monounsaturated fatty acid moieties, while the non-raft domain was enriched in phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine species having four double bonds. The changes in both the sterols and phospholipid composition of lipid raft and non-raft microdomains may have consequences in signal transduction and contribute to the sterility observed in HSL-deficient male mice.

Abstract: Excessive energy intake leads to fat overload and the formation of lipotoxic compounds mainly derived from the saturated fatty acid palmitate (PAL), thus promoting insulin resistance (IR) in skeletal muscle. N−3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n−3PUFA) may prevent lipotoxicity and IR. The purpose of this study was to examine the differential effects of n−3PUFA on fatty acid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in muscle cells. C2C12 myotubes were treated with 500μM of PAL without or with 50μM of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for 16h. PAL decreased insulin-dependent AKT activation and glucose uptake and increased the synthesis of ceramides and diglycerides (DG) derivatives, leading to protein kinase Cθ activation. EPA and DHA, but not ALA, prevented PAL-decreased AKT activation but glucose uptake was restored to control values by all n−3PUFA vs. PAL. Total DG and ceramide contents were decreased by all n−3PUFA, but only EPA and DHA increased PAL β-oxidation, decreased PAL incorporation into DG and reduced protein kinase Cθ activation. EPA and DHA emerge as better candidates than ALA to improve fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle cells, notably via their ability to increase mitochondrial β-oxidation.

Abstract: Plants rapidly perceive tissue damage, such as that inflicted by insects, and activate several key defense responses. The importance of the fatty acid-derived hormone jasmonates (JA) in dictating these wound responses has been recognized for many years. However, important features pertaining to the regulation of the JA pathway are still not well understood. One key unknown is the inactivation mechanism of the JA pathway and its relationship with plant response to wounding. Arabidopsis cytochrome P450 enzymes in the CYP94 clade metabolize jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile), a major metabolite of JA responsible for many biological effects attributed to the JA signaling pathway; thus, CYP94s are expected to contribute to the attenuation of JA-Ile-dependent wound responses. To directly test this, we created the double and triple knock-out mutants of three CYP94 genes, CYP94B1, CYP94B3, and CYP94C1. The mutations blocked the oxidation steps and caused JA-Ile to accumulate 3–4-fold the WT levels in the wounded leaves. Surprisingly, over accumulation of JA-Ile did not lead to a stronger wound response. On the contrary, the mutants displayed a series of symptoms reminiscent of JA-Ile deficiency, including resistance to wound-induced growth inhibition, decreased anthocyanin and trichomes, and increased susceptibility to insects. The mutants, however, responded normally to exogenous JA treatments, indicating that JA perception or signaling pathways were intact. Untargeted metabolite analyses revealed >40% reduction in wound-inducible metabolites in the mutants. These observations raise questions about the current JA signaling model and point toward a more complex model perhaps involving JA derivatives and/or feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: The natural food for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in freshwater has relatively lower levels of omega−3 (n−3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) than found in prey for post-smolt salmon in seawater. Land-locked salmon such as the Gullspång population feed exclusively on freshwater type lipids during its entire life cycle, a successful adaptation derived from divergent evolution. Studying land-locked populations may provide insights into the molecular and genetic control mechanisms that determine and regulate n−3 LC-PUFA biosynthesis and retention in Atlantic salmon. A two factorial study was performed comparing land-locked and farmed salmon parr fed diets formulated with fish or rapeseed oil for 8weeks. The land-locked parr had higher capacity to synthesise n−3 LC-PUFA as indicated by higher expression and activity of desaturase and elongase enzymes. The data suggested that the land-locked salmon had reduced sensitivity to dietary fatty acid composition and that dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) did not appear to suppress expression of LC-PUFA biosynthetic genes or activity of the biosynthesis pathway, probably an evolutionary adaptation to a natural diet lower in DHA. Increased biosynthetic activity did not translate to enhanced n−3 LC-PUFA contents in the flesh and diet was the only factor affecting this parameter. Additionally, high lipogenic and glycolytic potentials were found in land-locked salmon, together with decreased lipolysis which in turn could indicate increased use of carbohydrates as an energy source and a sparing of lipid.

Abstract: In a recent study, we showed that in response to high fat feeding C57BL/6, 129X1, DBA/2 and FVB/N mice all developed glucose intolerance, while BALB/c mice displayed minimal deterioration in glucose tolerance and insulin action. Lipidomic analysis of livers across these five strains has revealed marked strain-specific differences in ceramide (Cer) and sphingomyelin (SM) species with high-fat feeding; with increases in C16-C22 (long-chain) and reductions in C>22 (very long-chain) Cer and SM species observed in the four strains that developed HFD-induced glucose intolerance. Intriguingly, the opposite pattern was observed in sphingolipid species in BALB/c mice. These strain-specific changes in sphingolipid acylation closely correlated with ceramide synthase 2 (CerS2) protein content and activity, with reduced CerS2 levels/activity observed in glucose intolerant strains and increased content in BALB/c mice. Overexpression of CerS2 in primary mouse hepatocytes induced a specific elevation in very long-chain Cer, but despite the overall increase in ceramide abundance, there was a substantial improvement in insulin signal transduction, as well as decreased ER stress and gluconeogenic markers. Overall our findings suggest that very long-chain sphingolipid species exhibit a protective role against the development of glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin resistance.

Abstract: Diatoms accumulate triacylglycerols (TAGs) as storage lipids, but the knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism is still sparse. Starting from a partial sequence for a putative TAG-lipase of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum retrieved from the data bases, we have identified the full length coding sequence, tgl1. The gene encodes an 813 amino acid sequence that shows distinct motifs for so called “true” TAG-lipases [EC 3.1.1.3] that have been functionally characterized in model organisms like Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These lipases mediate the first initial step of TAG breakdown from storage lipids. To test whether Tgl1 can act as a TAG-lipase, a His-tagged version was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the protein indeed showed esterase activity. To identify the TAG degrading function of Tgl1 in P. tricornutum, knock-down mutant strains were created using an antisense RNA approach. In the mutant cell lines the relative tgl1-mRNA-level was reduced up to 20% of that of the wild type, accompanied by a strong increase of TAG in the lipid extracts. In spite of the TAG accumulation, the polar lipid species pattern appeared to be unchanged, confirming the TAG-lipase function of Tgl1.

Abstract: Sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) is a proposed potential therapeutic target for obesity and insulin resistance. However, the contributions of SMS2 to glucose metabolism in tissues and its possible therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, to determine whole-body glucose utilization and the contributions of each insulin-targeted tissue to glucose uptake, we performed a glucose kinetics study, using the radiolabeled glucose analog 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG), in wild-type (WT) and SMS2 knockout (KO) mice. Insulin signaling was enhanced in the liver, white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of SMS2 KO mice compared with those of WT mice. In addition, compared with in WT mice, blood clearance of 18F-FDG was accelerated in SMS2 KO mice when they were fed either a normal or a high fat diet. 18F-FDG uptake was also increased in insulin-targeted tissues such as skeletal muscle in the SMS2 KO mice. Whereas skeletal muscle sphingolipid content was not clearly affected, plasma levels of very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA)-containing ceramides were markedly increased in SMS2 KO mice, compared with in WT mice. We also generated liver-conditional SMS2 KO mice and performed glucose and insulin tolerance tests on mice with a high fat diet. However, no significant effect was observed. Thus, our study provided evidence that genetic inhibition of SMS2 elevated glucose clearance through activation of glucose uptake into insulin-targeted tissues such as skeletal muscle by a mechanism independent of hepatic SMS2. Our findings further indicate that this occurs, at least in part, via indirect mechanisms such as elevation of VLCFA-containing ceramides.

Abstract: Lipoproteins, namely high-density lipoproteins (HDL), transport a wide-variety of cargo in addition to cholesterol and lipids. In 2011, HDL and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were reported to transport microRNAs (miRNA). Since the original discovery, there has been great excitement for this topic and a handful of follow-up publications. Here, we review the current landscape of lipoprotein transport of miRNAs. HDL-miRNAs have been demonstrated to be altered in cardiovascular disease (CVD), including hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. As such, HDL- and LDL-miRNAs may represent a novel class of disease biomarkers. Below, we review HDL-miR-92a and miR-486 levels in myocardial infarction and unstable angina, and HDL-miR-223 and miR-24 levels in coronary artery disease (CAD). Moreover, we address HDL's contribution to the total pool of extracellular miRNAs in plasma and differential distribution of miRNAs across HDL subspecies. Finally, we address current and future challenges for this new field and the barriers to such work.

Abstract: Background
We have previously shown that high fat (HF) feeding during pregnancy primes the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatits (NASH) in the adult offspring. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear.
Aims
Since the endogenous molecular clock can regulate hepatic lipid metabolism, we investigated whether exposure to a HF diet during development could alter hepatic clock gene expression and contribute to NASH onset in later life.
Methods
Female mice were fed either a control (C, 7%kcal fat) or HF (45%kcal fat) diet. Offspring were fed either a C or HF diet resulting in four offspring groups: C/C, C/HF, HF/C and HF/HF. NAFLD progression, cellular redox status, sirtuin expression (Sirt1, Sirt3), and the expression of core clock genes (Clock, Bmal1, Per2, Cry2) and clock-controlled genes involved in lipid metabolism (Rev-Erbα, Rev-Erbβ, RORα, and Srebp1c) were measured in offspring livers.
Results
Offspring fed a HF diet developed NAFLD. However HF fed offspring of mothers fed a HF diet developed NASH, coupled with significantly reduced NAD+/NADH (p<0.05, HF/HF vs C/C), Sirt1 (p<0.001, HF/HF vs C/C), Sirt3 (p<0.01, HF/HF vs C/C), perturbed clock gene expression, and elevated expression of genes involved lipid metabolism, such as Srebp1c (p<0.05, C/HF and HF/HF vs C/C).
Conclusion
Our results suggest that exposure to excess dietary fat during early and post-natal life increases the susceptibility to develop NASH in adulthood, involving altered cellular redox status, reduced sirtuin abundance, and desynchronized clock gene expression.

Abstract: Chemerin is a novel adipokine associated with obesity and insulin resistance. α-Lipoic acid (α-LA) has shown beneficial properties on diabetes and obesity. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of α-LA on chemerin production in adipocytes in absence or presence of TNF-α, insulin and AICAR. The potential signaling pathways involved in α-LA effects on chemerin were also analyzed. α-LA actions on chemerin were tested in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in some cases in human subcutaneous and omental adipocytes. Chemerin mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR and the amount of chemerin secreted to culture media was determined by ELISA. α-LA induced a concentration-dependent inhibition on both chemerin secretion and mRNA levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The AMPK activator AICAR and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 dramatically abrogated both chemerin secretion and gene expression, and further potentiated the inhibitory effect of α-LA on chemerin secretion. Insulin was able to partially reverse the inhibitory action of α-LA on chemerin secretion. α-LA also reduced basal chemerin secretion in both subcutaneous and omental adipocytes from overweight/obese subjects. Moreover, α-LA was able to abolish the stimulatory effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α on chemerin secretion. Our data demonstrated the ability of α-LA to inhibit chemerin production, an adipokine associated to obesity and metabolic syndrome, suggesting that the reduction of chemerin could contribute to the antiobesity/antidiabetic properties described for α-LA.

Abstract: Primary human hepatocytes are considered to be the “gold standard” in studies of lipid metabolism despite a number of disadvantages like large inter-donor differences and inability to proliferate. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells retain many hepatocyte-specific functions but do also exhibit disadvantages like secretion of lipoproteins and bile acids that do not emulate human hepatocytes in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate whether supplementation of the culturing media with human serum could improve the functionality of HepG2 cells and thereby make them more apposite in studies of lipid metabolism. The cells were cultured with human sera (2%) from three healthy individuals or with fetal bovine serum (10%). Lipoprotein, apolipoprotein, bile acid, albumin, and proprotein subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9) concentrations in the cell media, as well as gene and protein expressions were then measured. We found apoB-containing LDL-sized but also apoA1-containing HDL-sized particles, increased bile acid and Pcsk9 concentrations in the cell media, as well as increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and differentiation in HepG2 cells cultured with human sera. Thus, supplementation of the culturing media with human serum improves the functionality of HepG2 cells and makes them more apposite in studies of lipid metabolism.

Abstract: In photosynthetic organisms, the photosynthetic membrane constitutes a scaffold for light-harvesting complexes and photosynthetic reaction centers. Three kinds of glycolipids, namely monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, digalactosyldiacylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol, constitute approximately 80–90% of photosynthetic membrane lipids and are well conserved from tiny cyanobacteria to the leaves of huge trees. These glycolipids perform a wide variety of functions beyond biological membrane formation. In particular, the capability of adaptation to harsh environments through regulation of membrane glycolipid composition is essential for healthy growth and development of photosynthetic organisms. The genome analysis and functional genetics of the model seed plant Arabidopsis thaliana have yielded many new findings concerning the biosynthesis, regulation, and functions of glycolipids. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified how the complex biosynthetic pathways and well-organized functions of glycolipids evolved in early and primitive photosynthetic organisms, such as cyanobacteria, to yield modern photosynthetic organisms like land plants. Recently, genome data for many photosynthetic organisms have been made available as the fruit of the rapid development of sequencing technology. We also have reported the draft genome sequence of the charophyte alga Klebsormidium flaccidum, which is an intermediate organism between green algae and land plants. Here, we performed a comprehensive phylogenic analysis of glycolipid biosynthesis genes in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms including K. flaccidum. Based on the results together with membrane lipid analysis of this alga, we discuss the evolution of glycolipid synthesis in photosynthetic organisms.

Abstract: Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] and its derivatives diphosphoinositol phosphates (DPIPs) play key signaling and regulatory roles. However, a direct function of these molecules in lipid and membrane homeostasis remains obscure. Here, we have studied the cold tolerance phenotype of yeast cells lacking the Inp51-mediated phosphoinositide-5-phosphatase. Genetic and biochemical approaches showed that increased metabolism of PI(4,5)P2 reduces the activity of the Pho85 kinase by increasing the levels of the DPIP isomer 1-IP7. This effect was key in the cold tolerance phenotype. Indeed, pho85 mutant cells grew better than the wild-type at 15°C, and lack of this kinase abolished the inp51-mediated cold phenotype. Remarkably, reduced Pho85 function by loss of Inp51 affected the activity of the Pho85-regulated target Pah1, the yeast phosphatidate phosphatase. Cells lacking Inp51 showed reduced Pah1 abundance, derepression of an INO1-lacZ reporter, decreased content of triacylglycerides and elevated levels of phosphatidate, hallmarks of the pah1 mutant. However, the inp51 phenotype was not associated to low Pah1 activity since deletion of PAH1 caused cold sensitivity. In addition, the inp51 mutant exhibited features not shared by pah1, including a 40%-reduction in total lipid content and decreased membrane fluidity. These changes may influence the activity of membrane-anchored and/or associated proteins since deletion of INP51 slows down the transit to the vacuole of the fluorescent dye FM4-64. In conclusion, our work supports a model in which changes in the PI(4,5)P2 pool affect the 1-IP7 levels modulating the activity of Pho85, Pah1 and likely additional Pho85-controlled targets, and regulate lipid composition and membrane properties.

Abstract: Mammalian cells maintain the glycerophospholipid (GPL) compositions of their membranes nearly constant. To achieve this, GPL synthesis and degradation must be coordinated. There is strong evidence that A-type phospholipases (PLAs) are key players in homeostatic degradation of GPLs, but the identities of the PLAs involved have not been established. However, some members of the Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing proteins (PNPLAs) have been implicated. Accordingly, we knocked down all the PNPLAs significantly expressed in human HeLa cells using RNA interference and then determined whether the turnover of the major glycerophospholipids is affected by using mass spectrometry and metabolic labeling with stable isotope-labeled precursors. Knockdown of PNPLA9, PNPLA6 or PNPLA4 significantly (30–50%) reduced the turnover of phosphatidylcholine, −ethanolamine and –serine. In a notable contrast, turnover of phosphatidylinositol was not significantly affected by the knockdown of any PNPLA. Depletion of PNPLA9 and PNPLA4 also inhibited G0/G1 to S cell cycle progression, which could thus be regulated by GPL turnover. These results strongly suggest that PNPLA9, -6 and -4 play a key role in GPL turnover and homeostasis in human cells. A hypothetical model suggesting how these enzymes could recognize the relative concentration of the different GPLs is proposed.

Abstract: Nonclassical P450s of CYP74 family control the secondary conversions of fatty acid hydroperoxides to bioactive oxylipins in plants. At least ten genes attributed to four novel CYP74 subfamilies have been revealed by the recent sequencing of the spikemoss Selaginella moellendorffii Hieron genome. Two of these genes CYP74M1 and CYP74M3 have been cloned in the present study. Both recombinant proteins CYP74M1 and CYP74M3 were active towards the 13(S)-hydroperoxides of α-linolenic and linoleic acids (13-HPOT and 13-HPOD, respectively) and exhibited the activity of divinyl ether synthase (DES). Products were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Individual oxylipins were purified by HPLC and finally identified by their NMR data, including the 1H NMR, 2D-COSY, HSQC and HMBC. CYP74M1 (SmDES1) specifically converted 13-HPOT to (11Z)-etherolenic acid and 13-HPOD to (11Z)-etheroleic acid. CYP74M3 (SmDES2) turned 13-HPOT and 13-HPOD mainly to etherolenic and etheroleic acids, respectively. CYP74M1 and CYP74M3 are the first DESs detected in non-flowering plants. The obtained results demonstrate the existence of the sophisticated oxylipin biosynthetic machinery in the oldest taxa of vascular plants.

Abstract: Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a hexa-coordinated hemoprotein with yet to be defined physiological functions. The iron coordination and spin state of the Cygb heme group are sensitive to oxidation of two cysteine residues (Cys38/Cys83) and/or the binding of free fatty acids. However, the roles of redox vs lipid regulators of Cygb's structural rearrangements in the context of the protein peroxidase competence are not known. Searching for physiologically relevant lipid regulators of Cygb, here we report that anionic phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositolphosphates, affect structural organization of the protein and modulate its iron state and peroxidase activity both conjointly and/or independently of cysteine oxidation. Thus, different anionic lipids can operate in cysteine-dependent and cysteine-independent ways as inducers of the peroxidase activity. We establish that Cygb's peroxidase activity can be utilized for the catalysis of peroxidation of anionic phospholipids (including phosphatidylinositolphosphates) yielding mono-oxygenated molecular species. Combined with the computational simulations we propose a bipartite lipid binding model that rationalizes the modes of interactions with phospholipids, the effects on structural re-arrangements and the peroxidase activity of the hemoprotein.

Lack of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in mice does not promote fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle,

Abstract: Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) converts phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the liver. Mice lacking PEMT are protected from high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, and exhibit increased whole-body energy expenditure and oxygen consumption. Since skeletal muscle is a major site of fatty acid oxidation and energy utilization, we determined if rates of fatty acid oxidation/oxygen consumption in muscle are higher in Pemt−/− mice than in Pemt+/+ mice. Although PEMT is abundant in the liver, PEMT protein and activity were undetectable in four types of skeletal muscle. Moreover, amounts of PC and PE in the skeletal muscle were not altered by PEMT deficiency. Thus, we concluded that any influence of PEMT deficiency on skeletal muscle would be an indirect consequence of lack of PEMT in liver. Neither the in vivo rate of fatty acid uptake by muscle nor the rate of fatty acid oxidation in muscle explants and cultured myocytes depended upon Pemt genotype. Nor did PEMT deficiency increase oxygen consumption or respiratory function in skeletal muscle mitochondria. Thus, the increased whole body oxygen consumption in Pemt−/− mice, and resistance of these mice to diet-induced weight gain, are not primarily due to increased capacity of skeletal muscle for utilization of fatty acids as an energy source.
