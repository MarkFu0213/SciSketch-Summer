Abstract: In the paper, results of electrical modeling of Cu(InxGa1−x)Se2 (CIGS) thin-film photovoltaic (PV) modules are presented. Whether the equivalent double diode model—DEM (Double diode Equivalent Model) is appropriate to model CIGS PV modules was investigated. Modeling was based on large amount of data (including current–voltage (I–V) curves) collected during long-term outdoor monitoring of PV systems. The process of applying baseline physical parameters to two of five DEM parameters: diffusion IS1 and recombination IS2 related components of dark diode saturation current was carried out. Modeled IS1 and IS2 values were used to replace previously approximated DEM parameters and then to predict measured I–V curves in order to determine electrical parameters of the PV modules. The parameters are used to predict energy yield in natural operating conditions. Results of modeling are presented and compared with measured data.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential performance of a novel concept for dividing solar radiation into spectral components that separately illuminate photovoltaic (PV) cells of different band gaps using an optical design that (1) is simple, easily manufactured, and extensible to many spectral channels and (2) does not achieve high geometric concentration factors. The concept that we explore leverages the approach of stacked luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) for dividing the solar spectrum using fluorophores that are tuned to different spectral bands. However, whereas multicolor LSCs must perform two functions using the same optical component—spectral division and concentration—we consider the performance of a similar design when only one demand—spectral division—is placed on it. We find that the optical quantum and power efficiencies can be quite high (QE>90%, PE>80%) compared to what one might intuitively expect. When we couple the light output to a simple detailed balance model of a solar cell using experimental performance parameters we find that solar-to-electric conversion could exceed 30% with four junctions, using existing PV materials. While this does not exceed what can be achieved by HCPV designs on multijunction epitaxially grown stacks, the concept presented here has the major advantage of being easily extensible to an arbitrarily large number of spectral channels. Because of this extensibility, the number of junctions in the system is limited only by the availability of PV cells with appropriate band gaps, so significantly higher system efficiencies should be accessible without major revision to the basic design presented here.

Abstract: In this study, we engineer and investigate the interface structure and chemistry at the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode (front-side electrode) as well as at the Mg−Ag cathode (back-side electrode) in metal phthalocyanine (MePc)/C60 organic solar cells (OSCs). For the front-side electrode, Zn-phthalocyaninetetraphosphonic acid (Zn-PTPA) and Sn-phthalocyanine axially substituted with tartaric acid (Sn-PTA) have been used for the surface termination of ITO coated glass substrates. Both terminations yielded OSCs with higher fill factors and open circuit voltages, thus increasing the power conversion efficiency by 33% and 67%, respectively. A possible influence of a chemisorbed Zn-PTPA on the film growth of the adjacent ZnPc absorber in the vicinity of the hybrid interface is discussed using X-ray reflectivity and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure data. Distinct effects of the Zn-PTPA and Sn-PTA terminations on the electronic properties of the ITO surface were found by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements at the valence band edge. We demonstrate the possibility to engineer the hybrid interface without additional buffer. For the back-side electrode we report the formation of buffer-free charge carrier selective Mg−Ag cathodes, which are applied for bulk heterojunction organic absorbers consisting of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) donor and fullerene C60 acceptor materials. The chemical and structural properties of the CuPc:C60/Mg−Ag interface are investigated by element depth profiling using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), grazing incidence X-ray diffraction analysis (GI-XRD) and XPS. We demonstrate that an optimum charge carrier selectivity is achieved with Mg:Ag/Ag cathode structures, where the Mg:Ag alloy layer has a composition close to that of Ag3Mg. In addition, Mg diffusion into CuPc:C60 layer is observed. As a result, an interaction between Mg and Cu2+ with a concurrent change in oxidation state of both metals takes place. However, no formation of MgPc is observed. The findings of this work are discussed against the background of the performance and electrical properties of the corresponding MePc/C60-based organic solar cells.

Abstract: Ternary silver–indium–sulfide samples were deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates using a one-step electrodeposition method. A new procedure for the deposition of AgInS2 samples is reported. The effect of the [Ag]/[In] molar ratio in solution bath on the structural, morphological, and photoelectrochemical properties of samples was examined. X-ray diffraction patterns of samples show that the films are the AgInS2 phase. The thickness, direct band gap, and indirect band gap of the films were in the ranges 209–1021nm, 1.82–1.85eV, and 1.44–1.51eV, respectively. The carrier densities and flat-band potentials of films obtained from Mott-Schottky and open-circuit potential measurements were in the ranges of 4.2×1019–9.5×1019cm−3 and −0.736 to −0.946V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively. It was found that the samples with molar ratio [Ag]/[In]=0.8 in solution bath had a maximum photocurrent density of 9.28mA/cm2 with an applied bias of +1.0V vs. an Ag/AgCl electrode in contact with electrolyte containing 0.25M K2SO3 and 0.35M Na2S. The results show that high-quality AgInS2 films can be deposited on FTO-coated glass substrates for photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications.

Abstract: The interface between an electrode and the organic active layer is an important factor in organic solar cells (OSCs) that influences the power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this report, a buffer layer of 2-thenylmercaptan/Au self-assembly film is introduced into OSCs as a substitute for the poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) layer. The electrode/active layer interface is meliorated by Au-S coordinate bond of self assembly after applying this buffer layer. The series resistance reduces from 20Ωcm2 in a device based on PEDOT:PSS to 10.2Ωcm2. Correspondingly, the fill factor (FF) increases from 0.50 to 0.64. Moreover, due to the dipole of this self-assembled layer, the open circuit voltage (Voc) also increases slightly from 0.54V to 0.56V and the PCE reaches 2.5%.

Abstract: Efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene): fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester composites have been fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass substrates using the sputtered nitrogen doped amorphous chromium oxide (NACO) film as a hole-transporting layer (HTL). Optimized parameters for p-type NACO layer fabrication have been obtained through argon/oxygen/nitrogen flow ratio variations. Based on the HTL, the power conversion efficiency up to 3.17% has been achieved. With the help of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Hall-effect measurements, we come to a conclusion that CrN in amorphous chromium oxide (ACO) film could prevent water dissociation and hydroxylation at defect sites on the ACO film surface, and reduce the electrical resistivity of films. The stability of NACO as HTL has been improved compared with that of ACO as HTL, which can improve the performance of OSC.

Abstract: Highly transparent and conductive aluminum-doped zinc oxide thin films (ZnO:Al) were reactively sputtered from metallic targets at high rate of up to 90nmm/min. For the application as transparent light scattering front contact in silicon thin film solar cells, a texture etching process is applied. Typically, it is difficult to achieve appropriate etch features in hydrochloric acid as the deposition process must be tuned and the interrelation is not well understood. We thus introduce a novel two-step etching method based on hydrofluoric acid. By tuning the etch parameters we varied the surface morphology and achieved a regular distribution of large craters with the feature size of 1–2μm in diameter and about 250nm in depth. Microcrystalline silicon single junction solar cells (μc-Si:H) and amorphous/microcrystalline silicon (a-Si:H/μc-Si:H) tandem solar cells with high efficiency of up to 8.2% and 11.4%, respectively, were achieved with optimized ZnO:Al films as light scattering transparent front contact.

Abstract: Aluminium modified clays were prepared, characterised and tested for their potential application as solar coolers of roof surfaces. The water adsorption isotherm of the samples with restored cation exchange capacity was of hydrophilic type II, indicating multilayer adsorption with large heat of adsorption and pore condensation of water vapour at the pressures of the proposed application. In addition, high moisture adsorption capacity (more than 0.1g of moisture per g of material at 60–70% of relative humidity) and fast kinetics for night sorption (comparable to silica gel) were determined for the freeze-dried pillared sample. In cyclic experiments with low irradiation during the day and night relative humidity of 55%, the maximum temperature inside the pillared montmorillonite was 6.5°C lower than the corresponding temperature inside a typical soil sample. The primary mechanism for the reduced temperature elevation at aluminium modified clays was evaporative cooling and desorption with minor influence of solar reflection. These results indicate the suitability of aluminium pillared clays for lowering the roof surface temperatures.

Abstract: It is clear that the microenvironment or niche plays an important role in determining the fate of stem cells: being stem cells or differentiated. However, the intrinsic pathways controlling the fate of adult stem cells in different niches are largely unknown. This study was to explore the role of β-catenin/Tcf4/survivin signaling in determining the fate of human corneal epithelial stem cells in different media. We observed that the low calcium serum-free media, especially CnT-20, promoted proliferative capacity, colony forming efficiency and stem cell-like phenotype of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) when compared with the cells cultured in a high calcium serum-containing medium SHEM. Three key factors in Wnt signaling, β-catenin, Tcf4 and survivin, were found to be expressed higher by HCECs grown in CnT-20 than those cultured in SHEM, as evaluated by real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunostaining. Transfection of siRNA-Tcf4 at 10–50nM knocked down Tcf4, and also significantly suppressed its down stream molecule survivin at both mRNA and protein levels in HCECs. Furthermore, Tcf4 silencing significantly suppressed the proliferative capacity of HCECs, measured by WST-1 assay, compared with the control groups, untreated or transfected with non-coding sequence siRNA-fluorescein. These findings demonstrate that low calcium serum free media promote ex vivo expansion of corneal epithelial progenitor cells that retain a less differentiated phenotype and high proliferative capacity via β-catenin/Tcf4/survivin signaling, a novel intrinsic pathway. This study may have high impact and clinic implication on the expansion of corneal epithelial stem cells in regenerative medicine, especially for ocular surface reconstruction.

Abstract: The use of zinc oxide (ZnO) based intermediate reflector (ZIR) in micromorph solar cells using low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) was investigated. The influences of deposition temperature and dopant gas concentration on grain size and lateral electrical conductivity measurements are presented. Further ZIR deposition conditions were then directly evaluated in micromorph solar cell devices. Their electrical performances were compared to reference cells and cells incorporating silicon oxide based intermediate reflector. It is shown that both reduced ZIR deposition temperature and increased total flow rate allow for better performing devices with increased shunt resistance, as further supported by lock-in thermography shunt imaging. Relative micromorph efficiency increase of above 7% is shown with thin ZnO layers, along with absence of loss or even small increase of total current in the whole structure compared to cells without intermediate reflector.

Abstract: We report on the fabrication of efficient polymer solar cells via airbrush coating as a promising method for low cost and large area production. We used a dual action airbrush for deposition of the active layer from a poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl-ester (P3HT:PCBM) blend dissolved in a co-solvent mixture. The resulting devices were measured under AM1.5G conditions and compared with spin-coated ones in air and nitrogen atmosphere. High power conversion efficiencies (η=4.1%) were obtained by optimizing the parameters of the spray system (i.e. film thickness, time of spray, distance between sample and airbrush, substrate temperature, etc.). The measurements also showed good repeatability and uniformity despite a relatively rougher surface.

Abstract: The sheet resistance of bare and encapsulated PEDOT:PSS films is investigated as a function of time when irradiated. A spectral sensitivity curve is extracted by monitoring the increase in sheet resistance over 500h while the films are exposed to monochrome light in the spectral range of 290–417nm at a power level of approximately 2W/m². It is shown that light of wavelength λ<315nm has to be strictly omitted to maintain the film's sheet resistance. The degradation can be significantly slowed down by taking proper encapsulation means. The impact of oxygen and humidity has to be blocked to avoid light induced oxidation reactions of PEDOT and subsequent conductivity losses. Alternatively, the conductivity can be maintained by the addition of stabilizing agents to the polymer dispersion.

Abstract: A structure is developed to help improve the TCO/p contact and efficiency of the solar cell. A p–i–n amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cell with high-conversion efficiency is presented via use of a double p-type window layer composed of microcrystalline silicon and amorphous silicon carbide. The best efficiency is obtained for a glass/textured TCO/p-μc-Si:H/p-a-SiC:H/buffer/i-a-Si:H/n-μc-Si:H/GZO/Ag structure. Using a SnO2/GZO bi-layer and a p-type hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (p-μc-Si:H) layer between the TCO/p-a-SiC:H interface improves the photovoltaic performance due to reduction of the surface potential barrier. Layer thickness, B2H6/SiH4 ratio and hydrogen dilution ratio of the p-μc-Si:H layer are studied experimentally. It is clearly shown that the double window layer can improve solar cell efficiency. An initial conversion efficiency of 10.63% is achieved for the a-Si:H solar cell.

The procedures include directions for shelf life testing, outdoor testing, laboratory weathering testing and thermal cycling testing, as well as guidelines for reporting data. These procedures are not meant to be qualification tests, but rather generally agreed test conditions and practices to allow ready comparison between laboratories and to help improving the reliability of reported values. Failure mechanisms and detailed degradation mechanisms are not covered in this report.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is a kesterite semiconductor consisting of abundantly available elements. It has a band gap of 1.5eV and a large absorption coefficient. Hence, thin films made of this material can be used as absorber layers of a solar cell. CZTS films were deposited on soda lime and Na free borosilicate glass substrates through Ultrasonic Spray Pyrolysis. The diffusion of sodium from soda lime glass was found to have a profound effect on characteristics like grain size, crystal texture and conductivity of CZTS thin films. Copper ion concentration also varied during the deposition and it was observed that the carrier concentration was enhanced when there was a deficiency of copper in the films. The effect of sodium diffusion and copper deficiency in enhancing the structural and electrical properties of CZTS films are presented in this paper.

Abstract: ZnO:Al films deposited at 250°C on Corning glass by radio frequency magnetron sputtering were studied for their use as front contact for thin film silicon solar cells. For this purpose, a two-step etching method combining different concentrations of diluted hydrochloric acid (from 0.1% to 3%) with different etching times was developed. Its influence on morphological, electrical and optical properties of the etched films was evaluated. This new etching method led to more uniform textured surfaces, where the electrical properties remained unchangeable after the etching process, and with adapted light scattering properties similar to those exhibited by commercial substrates.

Abstract: Paclitaxel is the most promising chemotherapeutic agent of plant origin despite its high cost and dose-limiting toxicity. Our earlier report has shown that cervical cancer cells can be sensitized by curcumin to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis through down-regulation of NF-κB and Akt. In the present study we have attempted to decipher the signaling pathways regulating the synergism of paclitaxel and curcumin. The study has clearly proved that Akt and NF-κB function successively in the sequence of paclitaxel induced signaling events where Akt is upstream of NF-κB. While inhibition of NF-κB led to complete inhibition of the synergism of paclitaxel and curcumin, inhibition of Akt brought about only partial reduction of the same, suggesting that, apart from Akt, there are other pathways induced by paclitaxel leading to NF-κB activation, which are also down-regulated by curcumin. Inactivation of NF-κB did not affect the activation of Akt and survivin, while that of Akt significantly inhibited NF-κB and completely inhibited up-regulation of survivin. Up-regulation of Cyclin-D1, Cox-2, XIAP and cIAP1 and phosphorylation of MAPKs, were completely inhibited on inactivation of NF-κB assigning a key regulatory role to NF-κB in the synergestic effect of paclitaxel and curcumin. While up-regulation of survivin by paclitaxel is regulated by Akt, independent of NF-κB, inactivation of neither Akt nor NF-κB produced any change in Bcl-2 level suggesting a distinct pathway for its action. As curcumin could effectively down-regulate all these survival signals induced by paclitaxel, we suggest it as a potent chemosensitizer to improve the therapeutic index of paclitaxel.

Abstract: Factor VIII (FVIII) catabolism has been demonstrated to involve LDL receptor-related protein (LRP). We have established that antibody fragment KM33 inhibits cofactor function of FVIII by interacting with the membrane binding region 2092–2093 of the C1 domain. As KM33 also inhibits LRP-dependent uptake of FVIII, we now assessed the role of region 2092–2093 for LRP-dependent endocytosis. For this purpose, we employed functional fluorescent FVIII-YFP or -GFP derivatives and U87MG cells which express high levels of LRP. Confocal microscopy studies and flow cytometry analysis combined with siRNA technology showed that the fluorescent FVIII derivatives are indeed effectively internalized by U87MG cells in a LRP-dependent manner. Competition experiments employing an antagonist of the LDL receptor family members revealed that there is a cell surface binding event for FVIII, which is independent of LRP. Cell surface binding proved to be less effective for the FVIII-YFP variants K2092A, F2093A and K2092A/F2093A. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that these substitutions affect LRP binding as well. Finally, flow cytometry analysis revealed a major reduction of endocytic uptake of these FVIII-YFP variants. Our results demonstrate that C1 domain residues 2092–2093 are of major importance for FVIII endocytosis by contributing to cell surface binding and receptor binding.

Abstract: A novel fullerene derivative with an N-hexylphenothiazine moiety, PTZ-C60, was synthesized and characterized. The new synthesized fullerene showed good solubility in common organic solvents such as toluene, chlorobenzene and 1, 2 dichlorobenzene. The synthetic product PTZ-C60 was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, FT-IR and UV–vis spectroscopy. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using the new fullerene derivative as the electron acceptor and P3HT as the electron donor. The configuration of the device was as follows: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. The weight ratios of the electron donor to the acceptor in the active layer were 1:0.5, 1:0.7, and 1:1. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the fabricated devices was found to be higher than that of devices based on C60 because the LUMO energy level of the new fullerene derivative was higher than that of C60. Further, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these devices was observed to be high when annealing was carried out at 150°C for 5min and the thickness of the active layer was 80nm. The maximum Voc, short-circuit current density, and PCE of the best device were 0.608V, 4.393mA/cm2, and 1.29%, respectively.

Abstract: The relatively low immunogenic and tumorigenic nature of fetal stem cells makes them attractive candidates for transplantation. Pancreatic progenitor cells (PPCs) derived from human fetal pancreas that are amenable to growth and differentiation into transplantable insulin-producing islet-like cell clusters (ICCs) have been reported recently; however, the immunological nature of these cells has yet to be characterized. We thus investigated and compared the immunogenicity of pancreatic progenitor cells and islet-like cell clusters from first- and second-trimester human fetal pancreas. Polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that pancreatic progenitor cells and islet-like cell clusters express immune-related genes of major histocompatibility complex, MHC-I and MHC-II, complement component 3 (C3), chemokine ligand (CCL19), and tumor necrosis factor super family (TNFSF10), but no expression of the co-stimulatory genes, CD80 and CD86. Interestingly, pancreatic progenitor cells showed a differential expression of MHC-I and MHC-II with advancing gestational age with a greater expression in pancreatic progenitor cells from the second trimester. Pre-incubation of the second-trimester cells with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) increased MHC molecule expression. Functional alloreactivity of pancreatic progenitor cells was investigated via mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs). Relative to first-trimester pancreatic progenitor cells, second-trimester pancreatic progenitor cells induced a greater extent of proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and resulted in more IFN-γ production in phytohaemagllutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells following co-culture. Results of the study indicated that first-trimester pancreatic progenitor cells and islet-like cell clusters have a distinctively lower immunogenicity relative to second-trimester pancreatic progenitor cells, even after a pro-inflammatory cytokine challenge.

Abstract: Stacked thin films composed of In2(Se,S)3 and CuIn(Se,S)2 layers were grown on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrate using electrodeposition of the corresponding selenide (In2Se3 and CuInSe2) precursors followed by annealing in H2S flow (5% in Ar). Structural characterizations of both layers revealed that the resulting film quality strongly depended on annealing conditions of both CuIn(Se,S)2 and In2(Se,S)3 layers: a compact and uniform film was obtained by annealing both layers at 400°C. Performance of Au/CuIn(Se,S)2/In2(Se,S)3/FTO superstrate-type solar cells also followed these structural characteristics, i.e., a preliminary conversion efficiency of 2.9% was obtained on the device based on 400°C-annealed In2(Se,S)3 and CuIn(Se,S)2 layers.

Abstract: It is a classical signaling pathway that the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) results in the phosphorylation of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and thereby initiates the transcription of osteogenic genes. Recently, it is found that the activation of ERK1/2 resulted from fluid shear stress (FSS) also increased the expression of Runx2 and β1 integrins, and finally enhanced osteogenic differentiation. However, it has been remained largely unknown how ERK1/2 regulates the expression of Runx2 and β1 integrins. We use the perfusion culture system to produce FSS exerting on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and thus activate ERK1/2. Our study demonstrated that FSS-activated ERK1/2 mediated the expression of osteogenic genes via two novel signaling pathways except for the classical signaling pathway: feedback up-regulation of β1 integrins expression via activating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and activation of bone morphogenesis proteins (BMPs)/mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad) pathway via activating NF-κB and thereby regulating Runx2 expression. These signaling pathways combined with the classical signaling pathway, with ERK1/2 as a hub node molecule, form a molecular signaling cross-talking network to induce the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. The understanding on the mechanism of FSS inducing the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs will not only be helpful to develop the bone tissue engineering but also provide new targets for drug discovery for treatment of osteoporosis and other related bone-wasting diseases.

Abstract: This study is one of a series of researches on polymer-assisted deposition (PAD) of thermochromic VO2 film. This paper describes the synthesis of Ti-doped VO2 films (V1−xTixO2, x=0–0.167) and a systematic investigation of the effects of Ti doping on morphology, crystalline phase and optical properties (visible transmittance, transmittance changes in near infrared (NIR) light across the metal–insulator transition (MIT), absorption edge, MIT temperatures and sharpness) of V1−xTixO2 films. The films showed excellent visible transmittance and large changes (∼50% at 2000nm) in the NIR-light transmittance before and after MIT for samples with a wide range of Ti contents (0–10%). The width of the hysteresis loop was severely reduced, which is in agreement with a qualitative analysis using the nucleation theory, while the MIT sharpness was not obviously influenced. An increase in the MIT temperature was observed for all samples with Ti doping, in particular 18.5°C for 2% Ti doping, which is quite large compared with those in the literature. However, the MIT seemed saturated at around 80°C. The morphology evolution of Ti-doped VO2 films was investigated for the first time. Interestingly, Ti doping could remarkably reduce the particle size of VO2 films due to Ti enhanced heterogeneous nucleation process of VO2 particles, indicating a new method for the growth of nanostructured VO2 films.

Abstract: Neutrophil attraction and adhesion to endothelial cells occurs via well defined mechanisms, yet the ability of other cell types to express neutrophil-binding adhesion molecules is not well studied. Cardiac fibroblasts (CF) are a key cell type involved in repair of the infarcted myocardium, a scenario in which neutrophil recruitment is perceived to be detrimental. Here we determined the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on expression of neutrophil-binding adhesion molecules and neutrophil-attracting chemokines in CF cultured from multiple patients, and explored the underlying regulatory mechanisms. An adhesion molecule focused RT-PCR array identified 5 transcripts that were increased markedly in human CF treated with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1, 10ng/ml, 6h); including intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and E-selectin. Real-time RT-PCR verified the array data and immunoblotting confirmed cytokine-induced ICAM-1 and E-selectin protein expression. Treatment with a panel of pharmacological inhibitors identified the NF-κB pathway as mediating IL-1-induced ICAM-1 and E-selectin mRNA and protein expression. Additionally, E-selectin expression in human CF was markedly potentiated by the JNK inhibitor SP600125, but this was not observed when a more selective inhibitor ((L)-JNKI-1) was used, or in human vascular endothelial cells. IL-1 also stimulated CF to secrete the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL8 via a p38- and NF-κB-dependent mechanism, as well as inducing CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5 mRNA expression. In conclusion, human CF express neutrophil-binding adhesion molecules and neutrophil chemoattractants in response to proinflammatory cytokines suggesting that, in addition to EC, CF may play an important role in regulating neutrophil recruitment into the infarcted myocardium.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only therapeutic modality capable of correcting the hematologic manifestations of Fanconi anemia (FA). The development of well-tolerated immunosuppressive conditioning regimens for FA patients undergoing HCT has proven to be a challenging task for hematologists.
DESIGN AND SETTINGS
Retrospective, patients referred to the hematology, oncology and stem cell transplantation research center.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
We analyzed the outcome of 53 FA patients who had undergone HCT between 1992 and 2010. The median age at transplantation was 9 years. Patients received transplants from an HLA-identi-cal sibling (n=39) or matched relative (n=9) and one-antigen locus mismatched other relative/sibling (n=5). All of the patients underwent transplantation with fludarabine and non-fludarabine-based conditioning regimens. No radiation therapy was given.
RESULTS
The median follow-up period for survivors was 13.5months (range, 3 months-13.5years). The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 60.6%. The 3-year OS for patients who did or did not receive fludarabine-based preparative regimens for the allograft was 36.4%, and 70%, respectively. However, there were no statistically significant differences in OS rates between these two groups (P=.112). Graft failure occurred in 4 patients (7.5%). All of these 4 patients had received fludarabine-based conditioning regimens. The incidence of acute GVHD after fludarabine-based regimens was 45% versus 79% in non-fludarabine-based regimens (P=.03).
CONCLUSION
Despite the high incidence of acute GVHD (78.6%) in the non-fludarabine group, which resulted in the death of some patients, the OS rate was significantly better than in fludarabine recipients. Therefore, in spite of the fact that recent studies advocate the fludarabine-based conditioning regimens, we propose to conduct a multicenter, prospective study to evaluate the outcomes of regimens employed in FA patients.

Abstract: We describe a study of the stabilization behavior of P3HT/PCBM organic solar cells under air and UV irradiation using a 20nm thin TiOx protection layer made by partial hydrolysis of a Ti-alkoxide and spin coating in air. Data on the degradation of solar cell performance under air and under UV exposure are presented indicating that significant improvements are observed with TiOx layer protection. The protection mechanism has been investigated by transmission IR and UV spectroscopy and by ESR spectroscopy. The results of this study suggest how sol–gel derived TiOx films containing organic functionalities serve as effective passivation films for protection from oxygen when excited by photons, where the photooxidation of the bound organic moieties causes oxygen gas scavenging.

Abstract: Recently, accumulating evidence has shown that several immunological molecules previously thought to be exclusively expressed by immune cells are also produced by nervous cells. Such molecules are thought to participate in the cross-talk between the immune and the nervous systems. IgG, an important immunological molecule, was traditionally thought to be produced by B lymphocytes only. In this study, extensive expression of neuron-derived IgG was detected throughout the nervous system. Relative quantification indicated that IgG was produced by neural cells at a low constant level. Transcripts of rearranged V-(D)-J segments and recombination activating genes-1 and -2 were also detected. Various IgG receptor types were also detected with distinct distribution patterns at different parts of the central and the peripheral nervous system. Given the widespread expression of IgG and its receptors, IgG most likely has an important biological function in the nervous system and might be classified as an immune mediator involved in neuro-immune crosstalk.

Abstract: A series of novel environmentally benign near-infrared (NIR) reflecting inorganic pigments based on yttrium cerate doped with metal ions such as Mo6+ or Pr4+ have been developed and characterized using XRD, UV–vis–NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and CIE 1976 L⁎a⁎b⁎ color scales. The substitution of Mo6+ for Ce4+ in Y2Ce2O7 changed the color from ivory-white to yellow and the band gap decreased from 3.01 to 2.44eV due to O2p–Mo4d charge-transfer transitions. Most importantly the molybdenum doped pigments exhibit bright yellow hue with high NIR solar reflectance (>90%) in the range 700–2500nm. In contrast, replacing Pr4+ for Ce4+ drastically shifts the absorption edge of the pigments from 410 to 725nm and as a result the band gap of the compounds changes from 3.01 to 1.70eV. Interestingly, the praseodymium doped pigments not only exhibits colors ranging from brick-red to dark-brown but also shows significant NIR solar reflectance. The ability of the pigments to transfer their NIR reflectance properties to a roofing material like asbestos cement sheet was evaluated.

Abstract: We show that the number of extracted charge carriers is a suitable measure to compare lifetime measurements on organic solar cells at different intensities. In detail, we used pin-structures with active layers containing a bulk heterojunction of Zincphthalocyanine (ZnPc) and C60. Extended lifetime measurements under constant monochromatic or white illumination at defined temperatures of 50°C or 90°C are done. On the one hand, we show that the number of extracted charge carriers is important to determine the degree of degradation. On the other hand, our results show that the energy of irradiated photons is significant for accelerated measurements. This is an major advantage for the realisation of accelerated lifetime measurements. Additionally, we find that not single charge carriers, but excitons cause the degradation of the observed solar cells.

Abstract: In this article, we have studied the temperature and illumination dependence of open-circuit voltage (VOC) in polymer–fullerene based solar cells. It has been observed that VOC at higher illumination intensities gets converged at 0K which gives information about maximum achievable VOC in a particular donor–acceptor blend. Besides this, recombination processes have been studied by transient open-circuit voltage decay (TOCVD) and the transition between recombination regimes has been observed for the first time. At low VOC carrier lifetime exhibits a constant value around 500μs, which is interpreted in terms of a monomolecular recombination regime. At higher VOC carrier lifetime decreases as derived from a bimolecular relaxation law. The method allows estimating the recombination coefficient, which results in 2×10−13cm3s−1. The results have been explained by considering Gaussian density-of-states (DOS) for highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).

Abstract: We report on the effects of long-term artificial accelerated ageing on the active layer of organic solar cells in the absence of oxygen. The samples were composed of a bulk heterojunction formed by poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) deposited on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). First, a set of experiments was performed to study the modifications resulting from prolonged exposure to UV–vis light. A gradual decrease in absorbance was recorded, and TEM results clearly indicated that the initial morphology was unstable upon long irradiation times. Second, we revealed that the annealing temperature of PEDOT:PSS strongly influenced the degradation of the active layer. Indeed, an increase in the PEDOT:PSS annealing temperature resulted in an important improvement in stability. Third, a comparison was made between different active layers obtained by changing the P3HT type, polymer:fullerene weight ratio and solvent nature. As expected, the polymer:fullerene weight ratio was shown to significantly impact the degradation kinetics. The ageing effects on the photovoltaic properties were then explored, and extrapolation of the data to outdoor exposure is also discussed.

Abstract: New symmetrical low band-gap small molecule materials, DPP-bis[ter-3HT-TPA] and DPP-bis[ter-3HT] as novel derivatives of Diketopyrrolopyrrole–thiophene with/without triphenylamine (TPA) end group have been synthesized and characterized. And the effects of TPA moiety were investigated. Compared to DPP-bis[ter-3HT], DPP-bis[ter-3HT-TPA] shows red-shifted absorption and significantly higher molar absorption coefficient. And the HOMO level of DPP-bis[ter-3HT-TPA] is elevated than DPP-bis[ter-3HT]. Moreover, DPP-bis[ter-3HT-TPA] exhibited one order higher hole mobility than DPP-bis[ter-3HT], suggesting that TPA contributes to a better hole mobility. The bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices with DPP-bis[ter-3HT-TPA] showed better efficiencies than DPP-bis[ter-3HT], showing the best power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.5% (±0.12) under 100mW/cm2 with a short-circuit current (Jsc)=5.73mA/cm2, a fill factor (FF)=0.45, and an open-circuit voltage (Voc)=0.59mV.

Abstract: The brushing painting method is one of the typical solution processes, which makes it possible to fabricate electronic devices by simply using polymers. For the fabrication of modules and large-area devices, however, a patterning process is required for each layer. Due to the problems associated with the conventional patterning, many studies have been conducted to develop new patterning . In this study, we successfully fabricated bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structured polymer solar cells (PSCs) on a plastic substrate with an active layer through the brushing painting process. In particular, flexible PSCs with hole transporting and photo-active layers formed by the repositionable adhesive-based patterning method were fabricated to produce large-area solar cells. The fabricated PSCs exhibited Jsc, Voc, FF and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of 8.5mA/cm2, 0.636V, 48.8% and 2.6%, respectively. In other words, they were more efficient than those fabricated by the spin coating method. In particular, an increase in the Jsc and FF values was observed when the series resistance (Rs) decreased to 29Ωcm2 while the shunt resistance (Rsh) increased to 2018Ωcm2.

Abstract: We developed a novel hybridized electron-selective layer comprised of Sb-doped SnO2 nanowires for efficient inverted polymer solar cells. A device containing Sb-doped SnO2 nanowires with 0.1mg/ml concentration showed a significant increase in power conversion efficiency to 3.23% with an enhanced fill factor, compared to a reference device without the nanowires (2.89%). Such improvement is attributed to the high electrical conductivity of one-dimensional Sb-doped SnO2 nanowires and to the good light transmittance through the wide band gap of tin oxide. Also the surface morphology of the hybridized electron-selective layer is made denser and improved by incorporating one-dimensional Sb-doped SnO2 nanowires, resulting in the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance.

Abstract: The use of nano-sized materials offers exciting new options in technical and medical applications. Single-walled carbon nanotubes are emerging as technologically important in different industries. However, adverse effects on cells have been reported and this may limit their use. We previously found that 200μg/mL of single-walled carbon nanotubes induce apoptosis in rat aorta endothelial cells. The current study aimed to determine the signaling pathway involved in this process. We found that reactive oxygen species generation was involved in activation of the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. The finding of apoptosis was supported by a number of morphological and biochemical hallmarks, including chromatin condensation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that single-walled carbon nanotubes induce apoptosis in rat aorta endothelial cells and that reactive oxygen species are involved in the mitochondrial pathway.

Abstract: An all-solution process was developed to prepare VO2-based double-layered films containing SiO2 and TiO2 antireflection layers. These double-layered films were optimized to improve luminous transmittance (Tlum) and switching efficiency (ΔTsol). The substrate/VO2/TiO2 double-layered structure showed the largest improvement of 21.2% in Tlum (from 40.3% to 61.5%). Tlum could be further improved to the maximum of 84.8% by combining film thickness optimization and antireflection layer deposition. ΔTsol (usually below 10% for single VO2 films) could be improved by adjusting the position of antireflection peaks (the highest ΔTsol was 15.1%). A sample with balanced Tlum and ΔTsol showed Tlum of about 58% (20°C) and 54% (90°C), and ΔTsol of 10.9%. This work is an important technical breakthrough toward the practical application of VO2-based smart windows.

Abstract: A life cycle analysis was performed on a full roll-to-roll coating procedure used for the manufacture of flexible polymer solar cell modules. The process known as ProcessOne employs a polyester substrate with a sputtered layer of the transparent conductor indium-tin-oxide (ITO). The ITO film was processed into the required pattern using a full roll-to-roll process, employing screen printing of an etch resist and then applying etching, stripping, washing and drying procedures. The three subsequent layers; ZnO, P3HT:PCBM and PEDOT:PSS were slot-die coated and the silver back electrode was screen printed. Finally the polymer solar modules were encapsulated, using a polyester barrier material. All operations except the application of ITO were carried out under ambient conditions. The life cycle analysis delivered a material inventory of the full process for a module production, and an accountability of the energy embedded both in the input materials and in the production processes. Finally, upon assumption of power conversion efficiencies and lifetime for the modules, a calculation of energy pay-back time allowed us to compare this roll-to-roll manufacturing with other organic and hybrid photovoltaic technologies. The results showed that an Energy Pay-Back Time (EPBT) of 2.02 years can be achieved for an organic solar module of 2% efficiency, which could be reduced to 1.35 years, if the efficiency was 3%.

Abstract: Ethylene dilauroyl, dimyristoyl, and dipalmitoyl amides were synthesized as novel solid–liquid phase change materials (PCMs) via condensation of ethylene diamine with the respective carboxyl chlorides (lauroyl chloride, myristoyl chloride, and palmytoyl chloride). The synthesized ethylene dilauroyl amide (EDLA), ethylene dimyristoyl amide (EDMA), and ethylene dipalmytoyl amide (EDPA) were characterized structurally by FT-IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy techniques. Latent heats of melting and freezing determined using DSC technique were found to be 127.83 and −118.30J/g for EDLA, 129.95 and −132.40J/g for EDMA, and 150.66 and −145.22J/g for EDPA, respectively. Phase change temperatures of these PCMs were ranged between 38.5 and 52.5°C. The synthesized PCMs were tested for durability by accelerated thermal cyclings including 1000 melting/freezing cycles. Besides the thermal endurance of the PCMs were determined by TG analysis. Based on the results it was concluded that EDLA, EDMA, and EDPA compounds synthesized as novel solid–liquid PCMs have considerable amount of thermal energy storage potential in terms of suitable phase change temperatures, high latent heats, thermal reliability, and thermal stability. Moreover, the other advantages of the synthesized PCMs over the fatty acids used are better odor, low corrosivity, and low sublimation rates.

Abstract: The current–voltage characteristics of mono-crystalline solar cell device under dark and illumination of 100mW/m2 (AM1.5) were measured. The efficiency of the studied device under AM1.5 was found to be 14.22%±0.2 compared with the company standards. The capacitance properties of mono-crystalline silicon solar cell device were investigated under dark and illumination conditions. The studied mono-crystalline silicon solar cell exhibits an unusual photocapacitance ranging from 50.4 to 4585nF under dark and 100mW/m2 (AM1.5) of white light, respectively. The drastic increase in the capacitance of the solar cell is due to the space charge polarization induced by the increasing number of photogenerated carriers. The photocapacitance mechanism of the solar cell was interpreted by modified Goswami and Goswami (MGG) model. The relative capacitance Cph/Cd (the ratio between the capacitance under illumination to the capacitance under dark) and the relative resistance Rph/Rd (the ratio between the resistance under illumination to the resistance under dark) as a function of the applied frequency at different illuminations were interpreted. The values of the interface state density Nss and interface capacitance Css are increased with the increasing illumination intensities. The prepared mono-silicon solar cell device is a good candidate for photocapacitive and photoresistive sensors in modern electronic and optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Optical transmittance and conductivity for thin metallic films, such as Au, are two inversely related and extremely important parameters for its application in organic photovoltaics as the front electrode. We report our findings on how these parameters have been optimized to attain maximum possible efficiencies by fabricating organic solar cells with thin Au film anodes of differing optical transmittances and consequently due to scaling at the nanolevel, varying electrical conductivities. There was an extraordinary improvement in the overall solar cell efficiency (to the order of 49%) when the Au thin film transmittance was increased from 38% to 54%. Surface morphologies of these thin films also have an effect on the critical parameters including, Voc, Jsc and FF.

Abstract: We report the photovoltaic properties of a D–A copolymer, poly(benzothiadiazole-thiophene-co-bithiophene) (PBTTbT), containing the donor (D) unit of oligothiophene with a hexyl side chain and the acceptor (A) unit of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) with a methyl side chain. The geometry, electronic and absorption spectroscopic properties of bithiophene-benzothiadiazole-thiophene monomer (M1) of the polymer were investigated theoretically by the density functional theory (DFT) method for deep understanding the relationship of the structure and properties of the polymer. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with PBTTbT as an electron donor blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) as an electron acceptor. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSC is 0.87% for an optimized PBTTbT:PC70BM weight ratio of 1:3, under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100mW/cm2. With the additive of 1% 1,8-dioctanedithiol and thermal annealing at 130°C for 15min, the PCE of the device was improved to 1.98%. The efficiency improvement of the device was ascribed to a better morphology of the PBTTbT:PC70BM active layer with the additive and thermal annealing.

Abstract: Expression of Bcl-2 family protein, Bfl-1/A1 has been found to differ considerably amongst macrophages infected with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv or with avirulent M. tuberculosis H37Ra. Present work was undertaken to deduce the significance of differential expression of Bfl-1/A1 in the outcome of mycobacterial infection. We have studied the role of Bfl-1/A1 particularly in autophagy formation in tubercle bacilli infected cells since autophagy has been recognized as a component of innate immunity against pathogenic mycobacteria. First, we have confirmed that upon infection virulent strain H37Rv retain Bfl-1/A1 for longer period and impose autophagosome maturation block within infected cells as evident from confocal microscopy. Moreover, down regulation of Bfl-1/A1 by siRNA induced autophagy formation and reduced bacterial growth. Furthermore, even the avirulent strain H37Ra resist autophagosome maturation and survive if the cellular level of Bfl-1 is maintained in THP-1 cells by stable transfection (Bfl-1 overexpressing cells). No noteworthy difference in mTOR expression was observed between normal THP-1 and Bfl-1 overexpressing THP-1 cells infected with either strain of mycobacteria. Interestingly, we found that not only mTOR but also Bfl-1/A1 is involved in rapamycin induced autophagy in mycobacteria infected macrophages. We have found that Bfl-1 physically interacts with Beclin 1 in Bfl-1 overexpressing THP-1 as well as in H37Rv infected THP-1 cells as they co-precipitated. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrated that Bfl-1/A1 negatively regulates autophagy and expression of Bfl-1/A1 in H37Rv infected macrophages provides the bacteria a survival strategy to overcome host defense.

Abstract: Copper is a cofactor for many essential enzymes in aerobic organisms. When intracellular copper levels are elevated, the Menkes (ATP7A) P-Type ATPase traffics from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) towards the plasma membrane to facilitate copper efflux. The ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) is required for maintenance of Golgi architecture and for vesicular trafficking, including the copper-responsive trafficking of ATP7A. Here we report an ATP7A-independent role of Arf1 in copper homeostasis. Whilst the loss of ATP7A function increased copper levels, RNA interference mediated Arf1 knockdown reduced copper accumulation in HeLa cells as well as in both wild-type and ATP7A-null cultured fibroblasts. Arf1 therefore affected copper levels independently of ATP7A mediated copper efflux. Knockdown of Arf79F, the Drosophila melanogasterArf1 orthologue, also reduced copper accumulation in cultured Drosophila S2 cells, indicating an evolutionarily conserved role for this protein in cellular copper homeostasis. Whereas severe Arf1 inhibition with brefeldin A caused fragmentation and dispersal of the TGN resident protein Golgin 97, the peri-nuclear localisation of the Golgin 97 was retained following Arf1 knockdown, consistent with a moderate reduction in Arf1 activity. Ctr1 levels at the plasma membrane of cultured fibroblast cells were reduced following Arf1 knockdown, indicating an Arf1-dependent trafficking pathway is required for correct distribution of this copper uptake protein. Arf1-dependent trafficking pathways are therefore required for optimal copper uptake efficiency in cultured human and Drosophila cells.

Abstract: Several works concerning the incorporation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in bulk polymer RR-P3HT (regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)):PCBM (methanofullerene phenyl–C61–butyric-acid–methyl-ester) heterojunction have been already reported by a number of research groups. The optical and electrical properties of organic cells have been extensively studied. We investigated the incorporation of functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) into the matrix of P3HT:PCBM photovoltaic (PV) cells. The photovoltaic characteristics of the cells depend on the concentration of SWCNT. The incorporation of low concentrations of SWCNT in the photoactive layer increases the current density Jsc before annealing and it can reach above 9mA/cm2. We attribute the improved PV performances to partial crystallization of the RR-P3HT. As revealed by XRD studies and confirmed by the absorbance spectra, which exhibit the typical shoulder at 600nm and absorbance in the near infrared region. Interestingly, we observe also that doping the P3HT:PCBM active layer by the functionalized SWCNTs increases the open circuit voltage Voc.

The device demonstrated a strong photovoltaic response under AM1.5 illumination of 80mW/cm2 with an open circuit voltage of 0.704V. The co-planar electrode design offers advantages in terms of electrode material selection and reliability as well as simplified device fabrication.

Abstract: TGFβ signals through serine/threonine kinase receptors and intracellular Smad transcription factors. An important regulatory step involves ubiquitination of Smads and/or TGFβ receptors by specific ubiquitin ligases, in a process that can be reversed by the deubiquitinating enzyme UCH37. Here, to explore the physiological role of UCH37 in TGFβ signalling we have generated stable and inducible HaCAT keratinocyte and Colo-357 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines mis-expressing UCH37. We show that UCH37 knockdown significantly inhibits the activity of a TGFβ-dependent gene reporter and selectively decreases levels of some TGFβ-dependent target genes, notably p21 and PAI-1, but only during the early phase of TGFβ receptor activation. Interestingly, UCH37 knockdown in Colo-357 cells had no effect on TGFβ-dependent cell proliferation and epithelial–mesenchymal transition, yet significantly impaired cell migration. Collectively, our data indicate that UCH37 sustains early TGFβ pathway activation kinetics that determines threshold-specific gene expression patterns, and that opposing actions of ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases influences distinct biological TGFβ-dependent biological responses. Moreover, we suggest that UCH37 could represent a viable target for novel and selective cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Composite phase change materials (PCM) for latent heat thermal energy storage were made by mixing two different kinds of exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGnP-1 and xGnP-15) into paraffin wax. Direct casting and two roll milling were used to prepare samples. The investigation on the thermal and electrical conductivity of nanocomposites with these two nanoplatelets was performed. Higher thermal conductivity of composite PCM can be achieved with nanofillers of larger aspect ratio, better orientation and lower interface density. The thermal physical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis. It was found that the latent heat of the nanocomposites was not adversely affected by the presence of xGnP nanoplatelets and the thermal stability improved.

Abstract: Mutations in prion protein are thought to be causative of inherited prion diseases favoring the spontaneous conversion of the normal prion protein into the scrapie-like pathological prion protein. We previously reported that, by controlled thermal denaturation, human prion protein fragment 90–231 acquires neurotoxic properties when transformed in a β-rich conformation, resembling the scrapie-like conformation. In this study we generated prion protein fragment 90–231 bearing mutations identified in familial prion diseases (D202N and E200K), to analyze their role in the induction of a neurotoxic conformation. Prion protein fragment 90–231(wild type) and the D202N mutant were not toxic in native conformation but induced cell death only after thermal denaturation. Conversely, prion protein fragment 90–231(E200K) was highly toxic in its native structure, suggesting that E200K mutation per se favors the acquisition of a peptide neurotoxic conformation. To identify the structural determinants of prion protein fragment 90–231 toxicity, we show that while the wild type peptide is structured in α-helix, hPrP90–231 E200K is spontaneously refolded in a β-structured conformer characterized by increased proteinase K resistance and propensity to generate fibrils. However, the most significant difference induced by E200K mutation in prion protein fragment 90–231 structure in native conformation we observed, was an increase in the exposure of hydrophobic amino-acids on protein surface that was detected in wild type and D202N proteins only after thermal denaturation. In conclusion, we propose that increased hydrophobicity is one of the main determinants of toxicity induced by different mutations in prion protein-derived peptides.

Abstract: This paper proposes an improved modeling approach for the two-diode model of photovoltaic (PV) module. The main contribution of this work is the simplification of the current equation, in which only four parameters are required, compared to six or more in the previously developed two-diode models. Furthermore the values of the series and parallel resistances are computed using a simple and fast iterative method. To validate the accuracy of the proposed model, six PV modules of different types (multi-crystalline, mono-crystalline and thin-film) from various manufacturers are tested. The performance of the model is evaluated against the popular single diode models. It is found that the proposed model is superior when subjected to irradiance and temperature variations. In particular the model matches very accurately for all important points of the I–V curves, i.e. the peak power, short-circuit current and open circuit voltage. The modeling method is useful for PV power converter designers and circuit simulator developers who require simple, fast yet accurate model for the PV module.

Abstract: Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (mean size of about 10nm) capped by surfactant oleic acid (OA) were incorporated into P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSCs by doping in the P3HT:PCBM photoactive layer for the first time. The PCE of the OA-Fe3O4:P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSC device is enhanced by ∼18% at the optimum OA-Fe3O4 NPs doping ratio of 1%. The role of the magnetic property of Fe3O4 NPs on the PCE of OA-Fe3O4:P3HT:PCBM devices was studied, confirming the exclusive contribution of the Fe3O4 NPs to the observed enhancement of PCE. The enhancement of the PCE of the OA-Fe3O4:P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSC device is found to be primarily due to the increase of short-circuit current (Jsc) by ∼14%, which is attributed to the magnetic field effect originated from the superparamagnetism of Fe3O4 NPs, resulting in the increase of the population of triplet excitons. Finally, the effect of Fe3O4 NPs on the enhancement of PCE of OA-Fe3O4:P3HT:PCBM device is further investigated by comparing different means of doping in P3HT:PCBM or PEDOT:PSS layer, confirming that such an effect can be achieved only when Fe3O4 NPs are doped in the P3HT:PCBM photoactive layer.

Abstract: 1, 2-dicyano-methanofullerene (C60(CN)2) is a soluble fullerene derivative that has been reported to have stronger electron affinity than parent C60. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments were carried out on C60(CN)2 thin films spin coated on heavily doped n-type Si substrate. UPS spectra enabled the determination of the vacuum shift at the fullerene derivative/Si interface and the onset of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). From the UV–vis absorption spectra of C60(CN)2 thin films spin coated on quartz substrates, the optical band gap (Eg) and the onset of absorption were determined. These measurements allowed the determination of the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) position. The morphology of the deposited film was probed by AFM and reveals non-uniformity of the thin film. Open circuit voltage (Voc) measurements on P3HT/C60(CN)2 based organic solar cell device are compared to the commonly used P3HT/PCBM device.

Abstract: Cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanoparticles of 2–7nm diameter were synthesized by a hot injection method and their TOPO ligands exchanged with pyridine by a liquid–liquid extraction process. The effects of the ligand exchange on the material properties of the nanoparticles and device performance of the bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) solar cell were systematically investigated. The wavelength shift to a shorter value observed in the PL spectra of the pyridine-capped CdSe indicates that the size of nanoparticles decreased due to the exchange of the surface ligands of the CdSe from TOPO to pyridine. Improvements in the power conversion efficiency of BHJ solar cells made with pyridine-capped CdSe are mainly attributed to the enhanced current collection, Jsc=0.43mA/cm2 (TOPO) to 1.4mA/cm2 (pyridine).

Abstract: The third (P3) laser patterning step of thin film photovoltaic devices is studied experimentally using a diode pumped solid state laser with 532nm wavelength and a delay generator. The effect on the electrical characteristics of the devices due to the patterning process is investigated by performing scribes on single, thin-film solar cells. As it is shown, in this type of experiments the inertia in the motion systems or in the scanner controlling the direction of the laser beam plays a critical role in the results. By controlling externally the output of the laser beam it is possible to overcome the inertia and investigate the real effect of the P3 laser scribing on the device electrical characteristics. When the laser scribing conditions are optimized and the inertia in the system is taken care of, the P3 process has very little effect on the device electrical characteristics. Translated to modules this means that by optimizing the P3 process, the decrease in the efficiency found when up-scaling from single cells to modules can be minimized (as far as the P3 process is concerned) to that coming from the removed area.

Abstract: Knowing the substrate temperature during in-line high-rate Al deposition onto silicon solar cells is essential for understanding and improving the deposition process. We deposit 2 and 5μm-thick aluminum layers at a dynamic deposition rate of 5μmm/min onto 130 and 180μm-thick, planar and pyramidally textured, p-type silicon wafers and measure the wafer temperature during the deposition. The temperature depends on the aluminum layer thickness, the wafer thickness, and the wafer emissivity. Two-dimensional finite-element simulations reproduce the measured peak temperatures with an accuracy of 3%.

Abstract: Sialyl Lewis X is a tumor-associated antigen frequently found in the advanced cancers. However, the mechanism for the production of this cancer antigen is not entirely clear. The objective of this study is to examine whether epigenetics is involved in the regulation of the formation of this antigen. We observed an increase of sialyl Lewis X in HCT15 cells, a colon cancer cell line, treated with 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine. This treatment enhanced the expression of β-galactoside:α2,3-sialyltransferase 6 gene and sialyl Lewis X on MUC1, and the adherence of these cells to E-selectin under dynamic flow conditions. In addition, 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment inhibited methylation of β-galactoside:α2,3-sialyltransferase 6 gene and siRNA knockdown of this gene drastically reduced sialyl Lewis X without affecting MUC1 expression. We conclude that 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment increases sialyl Lewis X on MUC1 by stimulating the β-galactoside:α2,3-sialyltransferase 6 gene via inhibition of DNA methylation. Increased sialyl Lewis X by 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine raises a concern about the safety of this chemotherapeutic drug. In addition, β-galactoside:α2,3-sialyltransferase 6 gene may be a potential therapeutic target for suppressing tumorigenicity of colon cancer.

Abstract: Mechanical properties of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blend films, prepared under different processing conditions, were evaluated by nanoindentation. Photovoltaic devices fabricated using above active layers presented the highest power conversion efficiencies for blend films having lowest Young’s modulus (20.73GPa) and hardness (649MPa), as measured by a nanoidentator under optimized conditions of blend proportion (1:1), film drying rate (slow) and annealing temperature and time (110°C and 10min). It implies that the degree of nano-scale phase separation for the P3HT:PCBM blend is strongly correlated with the mechanical properties in the nanodimension. The nanoindentation is a method to estimate nano-scale mechanical properties of blend films and the performance of photovoltaic cells.

Abstract: An improved post-deposition treatment for CdS/CdTe photovoltaic devices has been developed. Aqueous solutions containing pyrrole and sodium chloride provide a treatment of the CdTe surface when the device is illuminated with visible light. Evaporating gold metal on the CdTe surface completes the device structure. Comparison of the JV characteristics of the device treated with illumination to those not illuminated reveals a significant enhancement in device output. While most of the electronic properties (Jsc, FF, Rs and Rsh) are very similar the Voc for the treated sample is higher (circa 0.79V versus 0.71V) leading to a higher efficiency of 12.3% for the treated cell versus 11.0% for the untreated cell. The performance of this treatment is very much the same as that observed when the photochemically induced treatment employs aniline, the benefit of the herein described method is the decreased level of toxicity associated with pyrrole relative to that of aniline. Characterization of the CdTe surface with SEM does not reveal any noticeable features and could be interpreted as indicating that treatment leads to a very thin coating of material. The GIXRD data reveal the presence of elemental tellurium on the surface of the CdTe.

Abstract: This work aims at understanding the energy loss in the polysilicon deposition reactor during the production of solar grade silicon. The radiative heat transfer between the polysilicon rods and the reactor wall in the so-called Siemens reactor is studied in detail in this paper. First, the most commonly used reactor configuration, 36 rods in three rings, is explained, detailing the particular radiation transfer of each rod toward the wall. Based on this analysis, some proposals for diminishing the energy loss are proposed: enlarge the reactor capacity, improve the properties of the reactor wall and introduce thermal shields. The impact of each proposal on the energy savings is quantified. If the reactor capacity is enlarged from 36 to 60 rods, the energy savings would be around 11kWh per kg of polysilicon produced (kWhkg−1). Increasing the reflectivity of the wall, the savings would be around 17kWhkg−1. And finally, the potential for cost reduction because of the introduction of thermal shields would be 20kWhkg−1.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic devices with a photo-crosslinkable interlayer were fabricated. This photo-crosslinkable interlayer acted as a leakage current reducing buffer layer. The performance of the small area OPV cell (0.04cm2) was enhanced by the increase in the short circuit current and the fill factor. When a larger area cell (1cm2) was used, the performance of OPV cell increased when the appropriate interlayer thickness was used. In the case of a 10cm×10cm module, the power conversion efficiency was about double than that without the interlayer. The insertion of the interlayer increased the current extraction by lowering the barrier height and attenuated the fill factor reduction by enhancing the rectification with a better leakage current sealing. From this study, it is clearly proved that the insertion of the appropriate photo-crosslinkable layer improves the performance of OPV devices, the effect was especially evident for large area cells.

Abstract: We present a methodology which allows designing photonic crystals slabs (PCs) able to couple incident light into “slow Bloch modes” (SBMs) and dealing with their incorporation in an organic solar cell (OSC). We theoretically study different structures based on the same couple of organic materials (poly-3-hexylthiophène (P3HT) as donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butiryc acid methyl ester (PCBM) as acceptor): a 2D photonic crystal based on a perfectly ordered P3HT/PCBM blend (placed in the air), a 1D photonic crystal based on a nanostructured PEDOT:PSS (Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate)) layer embedded in a P3HT:PCBM host matrix (first placed in the air and then inserted in an organic solar cell) and finally a 1D photonic crystal based on a nanostructured P3HT:PCBM layer covered by a metallic electrode and inserted in an OSC ( with and without nanostructuration of the PEDOT:PSS layer). We show that the light coupling into SBMs in an OSC depends on vertical interferences and that optical spacers are needed. We then demonstrate that the P3HT:PCBM active layer nanostructuring covered by a thick metallic electrode exhibits the highest gain (4% in the 400–700nm spectral range) thanks to a simultaneous optimisation of the optical properties of the photonic crystal (coupling of SBM) and of the stack of the organic solar cell (vertical interferences).

Abstract: Solar modules are becoming an everyday presence in several countries. So far, the installation of such modules has been performed without esthetic concerns, typical locations being rooftops or solar power plants. Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems represent an interesting, alternative approach for increasing the available area for electricity production and potentially for further reducing the cost of solar electricity. In BIPV, the visual impression of a solar module becomes important, including its color. The color of a solar module is determined by the color of the cells in the module, which is given by the antireflection coating (ARC). The ARC is a thin film structure that significantly increases the amount of current produced by and, hence, the efficiency of a solar cell. The deposition of silicon nitride single layer ARCs with a dark blue color is the most common process in the industry today and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is mostly used for this purpose. However, access to efficient, but differently colored solar cells are important for the further development of BIPV. In this paper, the impact of varying the color of an ARC upon the optical characteristics and efficiency of a solar cell is investigated. The overall transmittance and reflectance of a set of differently colored single layer ARCs are compared with multilayered silicon nitride ARCs, all made using PECVD. These are again compared with porous silicon ARCs fabricated using an electrochemical process allowing for the rapid and simple manufacture of ARC structures with many tens of layers. In addition to a comparison of the optical characteristics of such solar cells, the effect of using colored ARCs on solar cell efficiency is quantified using the solar cell modeling tool PC1D. This work shows that the use of multilayer ARC structures can allow solar cells with a range of different colors throughout the visual spectrum to retain very high efficiencies.

Abstract: This study evaluated the possibility of utilizing a spray-coating process for large-area organic solar cells (OSCs) combined with a metal electrode geometry. The effects of the cell area in spray-coated OSCs were investigated systematically by introducing a metal sub-electrode and grid-electrode to realize large-area cells of up to 12.25cm2. The series resistance could be reduced significantly by inserting a metal grid-electrode into the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 2.11% at a cell area of 12.25cm2 and 2.49% at an effective photocurrent generated area of 11.23cm2 under AM.1.5 simulated illumination. This is comparable to the 3.13% obtained in the cell produced by spray-coating at a cell area of 0.38cm2.

Abstract: The polycrystalline silicon material grown by the edge-defined film-fed growth technique, and often used in solar cell production, is known to be carbon and dislocation rich. Aim of this work was to explore the effect of low-temperature annealing in vacuum on properties of these structural defects, often present in different solar-grade materials. Electrical measurements by deep level transient spectroscopy revealed the presence of the defects typically found in dislocated silicon. Detailed analysis further suggested that they are also carbon related, exhibiting quite unexpected behavior at such low-temperature annealing. Moreover, photoluminescence results showed electron–hole droplet condensation at dislocations after such low-temperature annealing. This further supports the hypothesis that point defects are incorporated at dislocation cores rather than in a cloud at its proximity.

Abstract: Understanding charge separation and transport is momentously important for the rectification of solar cell performance. To probe photo-generated carrier dynamics, we implemented intensity modulated short circuit current spectroscopy (IMSCCS) on porous Si and Cu(Inx,Ga1−x)Se2 solar cells. In this experiment, the solar cells were lightened with sinusoidally modulated monochromatic light. The photocurrent response of the solar cell as a function of modulation frequency is measured as the optoelectronic transfer function of the system. The optoelectronic transfer function introduces the connection between the modulated light intensity and measured AC current of the solar cell. In this study, interaction of free carriers with the density of states of the porous Si and Cu(Inx, Ga1−x)Se2 solar cells was studied on the basis of charge transport time by IMSCCS data.

Abstract: A seasonal chemical heat store based on the hydration/dehydration cycle of a magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) composite material has been developed. During summer, the material stores heat by an endothermic dehydration reaction and heat used for space heating is released in winter by rehydrating the material. For this specific purpose, a new thermal energy storage composite material has been developed, which is the subject of the present paper. The active material needs to be dispersed to optimise the gas–solid reaction kinetics and the thermal power released/absorbed. Zeolites have proved to be a favourable porous expanded structure for MgSO4 with energy densities of 150–400kWh/m3 at a storage temperature compatible with solar-thermal collectors. Characterisation by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on 10mg samples shows that almost 80% of the total energy density can be stored at 150°C although the material is not fully dehydrated. At a bigger scale, during hydration tests on 200g sample, an energy density of 0.18Wh/g is achieved, i.e., 45% of the theoretical energy density of the form-stable zeolite–MgSO4 composite sorbent. Micro-calorimetry measurements have confirmed that this energy density value remains at this level over 3 charge/discharge cycles.

Abstract: Antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) is a transparent conducting oxide (TCO), which has been the focus of intensified study due to its wide range of technological applications and low cost. In the present work ATO films have been prepared by reactive DC magnetron sputtering from a metallic target at different discharge power densities without direct substrate heating. Then a post-deposition annealing at 350°C in N2 during 20min was performed. There is a process window for the optimal sputter deposition of ATO with a minimum resistivity of about 3.3×10−3Ωcm observed in samples deposited at a power density of 1.13W/cm2. These samples, which present a (211) preferential orientation, have good electrical conductivity and good transparency in the visible range. Higher values of sputtering discharge power density (1.24W/cm2) change the preferential orientation to (101) because of the formation of oxygen vacancy planes. These samples are less conductive and transparent because their layered structure reduces the free charge mobility and allows the formation of Sb in its unusual oxidation state 4+ (between Sb3+ and Sb5+), which produces a sample blue darkening. Higher discharge power densities, above 1.41W/cm2, produce amorphous samples and an abrupt resistivity increase. The aim of the present work is to go into more depth in the knowledge of ATO in order to develop thin films with optimal electrical and optical properties.

Abstract: Monolithic solar modules made from thin-film crystalline-silicon layers of high quality on glass substrates could lower the price of photovoltaic electricity substantially. This paper describes three different approaches that we are currently investigating to address the challenge to form high-quality crystalline-silicon layers on glass substrates. The SLiM-Cut approach is a wafering technique that results in 50-micron thick layers with a minimum of material loss. We show that crack initiation can be used as a means to better control the lift-off process. The epifree approach involves the lift-off of ultra-thin monocrystalline films formed by reorganization of cylindrical macropore arrays in silicon upon annealing. So far, films with a thickness of around 1μm and very simple cells with an efficiency of up to 4.1% have been achieved. Finally, a seed layer approach is presented based on the epitaxial thickening by thermal CVD of monocrystalline silicon layers bonded on glass-ceramic substrates. Very promising cell efficiencies of 11% and Voc values of up to 610mV have been achieved using a very simple and non-optimized cell structure.

Abstract: Palmitic acid/silicon dioxide (SiO2) composites with flame retardant as thermal energy storage materials were prepared using sol–gel methods. In the composites, palmitic acid was used as the phase change material (PCM) for thermal energy storage, and SiO2 acted as the supporting material. In order to improve flame retardant property of the composites, melamine was added in the composites. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT-IR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electronic microscope (SEM) were used to determine chemical structure, crystalloid phase and microstructure of palmitic acid/SiO2 composites, respectively. The thermal properties, such as phase change temperature and latent heat, were investigated by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Thermal stability was determined by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The SEM results showed that palmitic acid was well dispersed in the porous network of SiO2. The DSC results indicated that the composites solidify at 59.20°C with a latent heat of 60.55kJ/kg and melt at 59.76°C with a latent heat of 85.11kJ/kg when the mass percentage of palmitic acid in the composites was 41.1%. The TGA results showed that addition of melamine improved thermal stability. The microstructure of the charred residue after combustion indicated that the homogeneous and compact charred residue decreased the flammability of the composites.

Abstract: Thin films of Ce/Cu mixed oxide with molar ratios of 1 and 2 were prepared from inorganic precursors using the sol–gel route. Various electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques were used for characterization of the films and investigation of their optical and electrochemical properties. It was found that the redox behaviour significantly depends on the Ce/Cu ratio and on the concentration of Li+ ions. Slow kinetics of the charge transfer reactions was evident from cyclic voltammetry measurements of both types of films only at low scan rates (<20mV/s). Measurement of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) indicated that the local structure of Ce and Cu ions is not affected by the Ce/Cu molar ratio.

Abstract: The effect of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as a buffer layer was investigated in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Four different types of PEDOT:PSS were used: PH, PH500 and their DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide)-doped counterparts. The efficiency of PSCs was independent of the electric conductivity of the buffer layer as a bulk property while it was significantly related to interfacial properties between the buffer layer and a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) layer. The interfacial properties included charge transfer resistance (RCT), hole mobility (μh) and contact angle (θ) of the solution of BHJ on the buffer layer. Lower RCT, higher μh and smaller θ led to the higher fill factor (up to 72%), enabling highly efficient PSCs with efficiency (η)=4.25%.

Abstract: The possibility to reach up to 14.7% efficiency with Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell, using a cadmium free buffer layer (indium sulphide:In2S3) and an electrodeposited front contact (chloride doped ZnO:ZnO:Cl) is demonstrated in this article. This is the first time that costly gas phase deposition processes for ZnO, by high vacuum sputtering, can be replaced by an efficient low cost atmospheric technology, representing an important breakthrough in further cost reduction for photovoltaic application. In addition, the compatibility with cadmium free buffer layers brings this new approach at the cutting edge of strategic evolution of the CIGS technology. In this study the influences of the In2S3 buffer layer thickness, the presence of an intrinsic ZnO layer and a soft annealing treatment are studied. It is shown that the growth behavior of the electrodeposited ZnO:Cl is controlled by nucleation phenomena on different surfaces, with a unique morphology on indium sulphide. Finally the best performances have been achieved with a cell annealed at 150°C under atmospheric conditions containing a very thin In2S3 layer (15nm) but without intrinsic ZnO (CIGS/In2S3/ZnO:Cl).

Abstract: CdTe solar cells and modules have been manufactured on polyimide (PI) substrates. Aluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) was used as a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) front contact, while a thin high resistive transparent layer of intrinsic zinc oxide (i-ZnO) was used between the front contact and the CdS layer. The CdS and CdTe layers were evaporated onto the ZnO:Al/i-ZnO coated PI films in a high vacuum evaporation system followed by a CdCl2 activation treatment and a Cu–Au electrical back contact deposition. In some cases prior to the cell deposition, the PI film was coated with MgF2 on the light facing side and the effects on the optical and electrical properties of TCO and solar cells were investigated. The limitations on current density of solar cells due to optical losses in the PI substrate were estimated and compared to the experimentally achieved values. Flexible CdTe solar cells of highest efficiencies of 12.4% and 12.7% were achieved with and without anti-reflection MgF2 coating, respectively. Laser scribing was used for patterning of layers and monolithically interconnected flexible solar modules exhibiting 8.0% total area efficiency on 31.9cm2 were developed by interconnection of 11 solar cells in series.

Abstract: Straight grooves were formed in single crystalline Si wafers and poly-crystalline Si blocks in an aqueous solution containing HF by an electrochemical method using Pt wires (φ=50μm) and a Pt foil as catalytic electrodes and a counter electrode, respectively. The grooves were formed by applying anodic potential of about 2.25V vs. Ag/AgCl to the Pt wires, which were in contact with Si. The grooving rate and morphologies were dependent on HF concentrations. The grooving rate was also dependent on the pressure applied to the Si/Pt interface. Grooves with a width of about 55μm were formed at the edge of a 250-μm-thick single crystalline wafer at a rate of 3.2mm/h by processing in 15moldm−3 HF under a pressure of about 54×104g/cm2. This pressure was necessary to increase the grooving rate. Possibly, an insulating porous silicon layer formed between Si and Pt was destroyed under this pressure. On applying this process to a poly-crystalline Si block, a Si wafer with a size of 1×1cm2 was obtained by the electrochemical method. However, the slicing speed was lowered as the depth of grooves increased and it took 120h to obtain the wafer. The slow exchange of HF solution in the groove was thought to be the main reason for the slow speed of slicing the Si block.

Abstract: The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor traffics between nucleus and cytoplasm to perform distinct functions. Here we identify a specific role for APC in the DNA replication stress response. The silencing of APC caused an accumulation of asynchronous cells in early S phase and delayed S phase progression in cells released from hydroxyurea-mediated replication arrest. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed a selective binding of APC to replication protein A 32kDa subunit (RPA32), and the APC–RPA32 complex increased at chromatin after hydroxyurea treatment. Interestingly, APC knock-down prevented accumulation at chromatin of the stress-induced S33- and S29-phosphorylated forms of RPA32, and reduced the expression of ATR-phosphorylated forms of S317-phospho-Chk1 and γ-H2AX. Using RPA32-inducible cells we showed that reconstitution of RPA32 diminished the S-phase delay caused by loss of APC. In contrast to full-length APC, the truncated APC mutant protein expressed in SW480 colon cancer cells was impaired in its binding and regulation of RPA32, and failed to regulate cell cycle after replication stress. We propose that APC associates with RPA at stalled DNA replication forks and promotes the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of RPA32, Chk1 and γ-H2AX in response to DNA replication stress, thereby influencing the rate of re-entry into the cell cycle.

Abstract: Sjogren's syndrome and radiotherapy for head and neck cancers result in irreversible damage to functional salivary tissue, for which no adequate treatment is available. The microenvironment for salivary gland cell cytodifferentiation is critical for the future development of salivary gland regeneration, repair and tissue engineering treatments. Results from this study indicate that human submandibular cell line (HSG) cultured on Matrigel (2mg/ml) could be induced to differentiate into polarized secretory acinar-like cells. The HSG cells grown on Matrigel were evaluated by physiological functional assays, molecular and immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and morphological assessments. The results showed (1) a decrease in cell proliferation; (2) an increase in cell apoptosis; (3) cellular polarization evident by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), expressions of tight junction proteins (claudin-1, -2, -3, -4, occludin, JAM-A, and ZO-1) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); (4) an increase in the production and/or secretion of acinar cell proteins, i.e., alpha-amylase, aquaporin-5, cytokeratins, and mucin-1, that were not associated with increases in mRNA transcription; (5) a decrease in vimentin expression; and (6) expression of potential stem cell biomarkers CD44 and CD166. The data indicated that Matrigel provided a suitable microenvironment for morphological and functional differentiation of HSG cells into 3D acinar like cells. This study provides an in vitro model and baseline data on future developments of new strategies for salivary gland regeneration and replacement.

Abstract: The present report investigated the pathway(s) involved in the inhibition of apoptosis by the synthetic androgen, R1881 in serum-starved LNCaP cells exposed to the pi3K inhibitor, LY294002. R1881 blocked LY294002-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of Bak activation via an increase in Bcl-xL transcription and protein expression. In addition, R1881 treatment enhanced the stability of the Pim-1 kinase, resulting in the inhibition of the activation of the BH3-only protein Bad through its phosphorylation at ser75. Pharmacological inhibition of the Pim-1 kinase activity with quercetagetin, a highly selective Pim-1 inhibitor, prevented R1881-mediated increase in Bad phosphorylation and restored cell sensitivity to LY294002-induced apoptosis despite the increase in Bcl-xL expression. These results demonstrate for the first time that the inhibition of LY294002-induced apoptosis by androgen is a function of an androgen receptor-dependent genomic signaling pathway leading to an increase in Bcl-xL expression as well as a non-genomic, Pim-1-dependent, signaling pathway mediated via phosphorylation of Bad at ser75.

Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) afford protection in several experimental models of kidney disease. HIF-1α protein is degraded under normoxia but stabilized by hypoxia, which activates its transcription factor function. ATRA activates another set of transcription factors, the retinoic acid receptors (RAR) α, β and γ, which mediate its effects on target genes. ATRA also up-regulates the expression of RAR α, β and γ at the transcriptional level. Here we demonstrate the presence of mutual regulation of hypoxic and retinoic acid related signalling in tubular proximal cells. In human proximal tubular HK-2 cells we have found that: (i) ATRA treatment induces HIF-1α under normoxic conditions and also synergizes with hypoxia leading to the over-expression of HIF-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor-A, a HIF-1α-regulated renal protector. ATRA-induced HIF-1α expression involved stabilization of HIF-1α mRNA but not of HIF-1α protein. (ii) Expression of HIF-1α is an absolute requirement for the transcriptional up-regulation of RARβ by ATRA. Transfection with HIF-1α siRNA abolished the induction by ATRA of the expression of both RARβ mRNA and protein while treatment with HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1 results in the abolishment of ATRA-induced activity of a retinoic acid-response element (RARE) construct from the RARβ promoter. (iii) Hypoxia up-regulates RARβ through HIF-1α since this effect was inhibited by HIF-1α knockdown. In contrast to ATRA-induced RARβ up-regulation, induction of RARβ expression by ATRA did not involve transcriptional up-regulation as hypoxia did not increase the expression of RARβ mRNA or the activity of the RARE construct. These results suggest the presence of crosstalk between hypoxia/HIF-1α and ATRA/RARβ that may be physiologically and pharmacologically relevant.

Abstract: The effect of n-type phthalocyanine tin (IV) dichloride (SnCl2Pc) as cathode interfacial layer on the performance of poly[2-methoxy,5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction solar cells (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MEH-PPV:PCBM/SnCl2Pc/LiF/Al) is investigated. Our results show that the integration of SnCl2Pc into the solar cell not only enhances the exciton dissociation efficiency due to the formation of additional MEH-PPV/SnCl2Pc exciton dissociation junction, but also improves the electron transport and collection due to the step-like electron injection barrier to cathode caused by SnCl2Pc interlayer. The incorporation of 6nm thick SnCl2Pc interlayer leads to 15.7% improvement of the short circuit current density (JSC), which in turn results in 15.2% improvement of power conversion efficiency (η) up to 2.49%. The results suggest that the employment of an n-type organic semiconductor like SnCl2Pc as an interlayer is a promising strategy to improve the device performance of polymer solar cells.

Abstract: The external quantum efficiencies of P3HT:PCBM blend solar cells decrease significantly when they are bent or illuminated at large incident angles because of (i) optical anisotropy of the P3HT:PCBM films—primarily because a mismatch between the direction of the electric field of the incoming light and the orientation of the P3HT:PCBM blend nanocrystallites results in a significant reduction in the amount of TM-polarized light absorbed and (ii) interfacial reflection of multilayer structures – primarily because the outermost air–flexible substrate interface exhibits a distinct refractive index difference – at large incident angles. Textured moth-eye structures fabricated by nanoimprint lithography on the flexible substrates of organic solar cells reduce the degree of interfacial reflection at high incident angles; they should allow more TE-polarized light to absorb in the P3HT:PCBM films (active layers) of the organic solar cells.

Abstract: The present work gives an overview of how electron microscopy and its related techniques are used to analyze individual layers and their interfaces in Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 thin-film solar cells. Imaging of samples can be performed at scales of down to the (sub)angstroms range. At similar spatial resolutions, information on composition can be gathered by means of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and on spatial distributions of electrostatic Coulomb potentials in the specimen by applying electron holography. Microstructural and compositional properties as well as charge-carrier collection and radiative recombination behavior of the individual layers are accessible by use of electron backscatter diffraction, EDX, electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) and cathodoluminescence measurements, available in scanning electron microscopy. The present contribution gives an overview of the various scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques applied on Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 thin-film solar cells, examples from case studies, and also demonstrates how these techniques may be combined in order to improve the analysis. Particularly, EBIC results show a reduced charge-carrier collection at Cu(In,Ga)Se2 grain boundaries, while no indication was found for a charge accumulation at the grain boundaries by electron holography.

Abstract: High-chain fatty acid esters have not been investigated for their thermal properties as phase change materials (PCMs) in thermal energy storage. A series of high-chain fatty acid esters of myristyl alcohol (1-tetradecanol) were synthesized via esterification of lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic and arachidic acids under vacuum and in the absence of any catalyst. The esterification reactions were studied by FT-IR spectroscopy. A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) were intensively used to determine the thermal properties of the introduced thermal storage materials. The thermal properties were given in terms of phase change temperature, enthalpy, specific heat (Cp) and thermal decomposition temperature with related statistical data. The thermal reliability of the novel organic PCMs was investigated by thermal cycling with 1000 thermal cycles with respect to the thermal properties of the original synthesized PCMs. In addition to the synthesized esters, one commercial product was also investigated. The DSC analyses indicated that the melting points of the novel organic PCMs were between 38 and 53°C with phase change enthalpy above 200kJ/kg. The effect of chemical structure of the materials on thermal properties was also discussed. The results showed that these materials were favorable for low temperature heat transfer applications with superior thermal properties and reliability.

Abstract: We report the antireflective characteristics of disordered subwavelength structures (SWSs) fabricated on a GaAs substrate by thermal dewetting induced Au nanoparticle masks in a subsequent inductively coupled plasma etching process. The optical reflectance relies on the geometric profile of disordered GaAs SWSs. The average size of Au nanoparticles and the correlation distance between adjacent nanoparticles are determined by the Au film thickness and the thermal dewetting condition. It is found that the height and shape of the SWSs, which can be controlled by changing the etching parameters, affect the reflectance strongly. The tapered SWS with a height of ∼380nm results in a relatively low reflectance spectra of <∼5% in the wavelength range of 350–900nm. The angle-dependent reflectance is also investigated for the fabricated GaAs SWSs.

Abstract: Rad51D, one of five Rad51 paralogs, is required for homologous recombination and disruption of Holliday junctions with bloom syndrome protein (BLM) in vertebrates. The N-terminal domain of Rad51D is highly conserved in eukaryotic Rad51D orthologs and is essential for protein–protein interaction with XRCC2, but nothing is known about its individual structure or function. In this study, we determined the solution structure of the human Rad51D N-terminal domain (residues 1–83), which consists of four short helices flanked by long N- and C-terminal tails. Interestingly, the position of the N-terminal tail (residues 1–13) is fixed within the domain structure via several hydrophobic interactions between Leu4 and Thr27, Leu4 and Val28, and Val6 and Ile17. We show that the domain preferentially binds to ssDNA versus dsDNA and does not bind to a mobile Holliday junction by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. NMR titration and dynamics studies showed that human Rad51D-N interacts with ssDNA by positively charged and hydrophobic residues on its surface. The results suggest that the N-terminal domain of Rad51D is required for the ssDNA-specific binding function of human Rad51D and that the conserved N-terminal domains of other Rad51 paralogs may have distinguishable functions from each other in homologous recombination.

Abstract: A Cu(In,Ga)S2-based solar cell with a confirmed efficiency of 12.6% together with an open circuit voltage of 879mV, prepared from sputtered metals subsequently sulfurized using rapid thermal processing in sulfur vapor, is reported. The performance of the new cell is superior to those obtained previously with multi-source evaporated absorbers. We show that by carefully adjusting the temperature profile, good absorber properties could be transferred from a long process to a rapid thermal process. The improved efficiency is due to an appropriate degree of gallium diffusion toward the surface, which could be achieved despite the short sulfurization time. Absorber and solar cell characteristics are presented.

Abstract: The effects of water content on the degradation behavior of dye-sensitized solar cells were studied by adding water isotopes (H2O, D2O, and H218O) to the electrolytes. Time-dependent photovoltaic performance of the water-added DSSCs was monitored accompanied with the diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. DRIFT technique was utilized to study the chemical reactions that occurred on the working electrodes (TiO2). EIS was implemented to evaluate the effects of the charge-transfer resistance at the interfaces between TiO2/dye/electrolyte. Results show that the degradation rates of the cells in presence of water isotopes were in the order of H2O>D2O>H218O. In addition, the values of open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) for the water-added cells increased within first 12h sun irradiation. However, their short-circuit current (Jsc) and efficiency (η) decreased during the sun irradiation. Moreover, a new peak assigned to LiNCS was noticed after soaking in water-added electrolytes for 48h, attributing to the interaction of lithium ions with free thiocyanate ions from the dye.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have recently received increasing attention as alternatives to inorganic solar cells because of their light weight, compatibility with flexible electronics, and low production cost. In this work, an ideal device structure for ordered bulk heterojunction (OBHJ) organic photovoltaics is proposed. Also suggested is a parameter related to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices. Such a parameter could serve as a rule of thumb for researchers. For cases in which it is difficult to reduce the pillar size and spacing, the proposed parameter dictates that an increase in the active layer thickness could be one way to increase the PCE of an OBHJ. To generate maximum PCE, (1) the pillar size and spacing must be two to three times less than the exciton diffusion length and (2) the thickness of the active layer has to be greater than half of the photon mean free path, which is the inverse of the absorption coefficient.

Activation-induced internalization differs for the tetraspanins CD9 and Tspan8: Impact on tumor cell motility,

Abstract: Exosomes are most important intercellular communicators and tetraspanins/tetraspanin-complexes have been suggested to play an important role in exosomal target cell selection. We have shown that only exosomes expressing a Tspan8–CD49d complex preferentially bind endothelial cells, which initiates angiogenesis. This finding was unexpected as in the exosome donor cell Tspan8 is associated with CD49c and the tetraspanins CD9 and CD151. In view of the discussed therapeutic power of exosomes as message/drug transporter, it became important to clarify the mechanisms accounting for the distinct Tspan8-web in the cell membrane versus exosomes. We therefore compared the route of Tspan8 and Tspan8-chimera internalization, where the N- and/or C-terminal regions were exchanged with the corresponding regions of CD9 or CD151. Activation-induced Tspan8-internalization proceeds more rapidly than CD9 internalization and is accompanied by disassembly of the Tspan8–CD9–CD151 membrane complex in resting cells. Tspan8-internalization relies on the association of the Tspan8 N-terminal region with intersectin-2, a multimodular complex involved in clathrin-coated pit internalization. Internalization and recovery of Tspan8 in early endosomes is further promoted by the recruitment of CD49d such that only in PMA-activated cells a Tspan8–INS2–CD49d–clathrin complex is recovered in cholesterol-depletion-resistant membrane microdomains. PMA-induced Tspan8-internalization promotes cell migration, but reduces matrix and cell adhesion. Thus, stimulation initiates tetraspanin-web rearrangements, which have strong functional consequences for the cell, exosome-delivery and exosome target selection. This knowledge will be essential for generating tailored therapeutic exosomes.

Abstract: The electrical property of the organic–inorganic heterojunctions is one of the important factors affecting the performance of hybrid photovoltaic devices. We introduce a good electron conductor, C60, to modify the surface of ZnO-nanorod arrays in a ZnO-nanorod/poly(3-hexylthiophene):(6,6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (ZnO/P3HT:PCBM) hybrid photovoltaic structure. We found that there is ∼40% and ∼15% increment in the short circuit current (JSC) and open circuit voltage (VOC), respectively, for the device after C60 modification. By probing the carrier dynamics and the surface property of ZnO-nanorods, the presence of the C60 layer assists the exciton separation and passivates part of the defect states on the ZnO-nanorod surface. The charge transport property at the ZnO/polymer blend interface is, therefore, improved. As a result, higher charge concentration can transfer from the polymer blend to the ZnO-nanorods more effectively and subsequently travel to electrodes leading to the improved performance in the photovoltaic device.

Abstract: The high temperature stability of the organic solar cells (OSCs) was improved using a phosphine oxide based organic cathode modification layer instead of LiF. The OSC modified with the phosphine oxide cathode modification layer showed constant device performances after a thermal treatment at 90°C, while the LiF based OSC exhibited degraded device performance after the thermal treatment. The use of the phosphine oxide based interlayer was effective to improve the high temperature stability of the OSC.

Abstract: Citrate carrier (CiC), also known as tricarboxylate carrier, is an integral protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane. It is an essential component of the shuttle system by which mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, primer for both fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, is transported into the cytosol, where lipogenesis occurs. Here, we report the effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on the activity and expression of CiC in rat liver mitochondria. A significant reduction of CiC activity and a parallel decline in the abundance of CiC mRNA were found in liver from diabetic rats. Diabetes did not influence CiC mRNA stability, whereas nuclear run-on assay revealed that the transcriptional rate of CiC mRNA decreased, when compared to control, in the nuclei from diabetic rats. The ratio of mature to precursor CiC RNA decreased in diabetic animals, indicating that the splicing of CiC RNA was also affected. The 3′-end processing rate of CiC mRNA was not altered in diabetes. These results suggest that diabetes affects CiC expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. In addition, by in vitro transfection experiments in rat hepatocytes cultured in the absence of insulin, a reduction of CiC promoter activity was observed, and this was ascribed to a decreased expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 transcriptional factor. Furthermore, the binding of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 to the CiC promoter was reduced in STZ-diabetic rats with respect to control ones, and it was restored to the control values after insulin treatment.

Abstract: A procedure to prepare flat and dense composite films of a conjugated polymer poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEHPPV) and various amounts of neat C60 by means of electrophoretic deposition from dilute suspensions is reported. It has been observed that deposition from suspensions containing both components results in pinhole-free films, which are applicable to photovoltaic devices, while inhomogeneous films are formed from the suspensions containing only one of the components. The applicability of electrophoretic deposition to obtain polymer–C60 composite films showing photovoltaic effects has been successfully demonstrated.

Abstract: Photoluminescence output from InAs/GaAs quantum dots has been improved by a Sb treatment immediately prior to capping with GaAs. Spectra taken at 300 and 80K show a significant increase in output intensity when the quantum dots are exposed for 15s under a Sb flux of approximately 0.1 monolayers per second, but this improvement is lost when the Sb exposure is extended to 30s. There is no significant shift in the emission energies between samples indicating strain relief due to the cap layer is not responsible for the improvement. Analysis of temperature dependent photoluminescence taken between 80 and 300K show increased activation energies at lower temperatures when an Sb spray is used, suggesting passivation of deep defect levels. For the higher temperature activation energy, corresponding to carrier escape from the QD to the barrier, whilst a 15s Sb spray gives a substantial increase, the longer 30s Sb spray sees the activation energy decrease, a result deduced to be due to Sb segregation providing shallow defect levels. A band structure including a very thin GaAsSb layer adjacent to the quantum dots is used to explain these results, with the 30s Sb spray leading to shallow Sb segregation related defects and a lower activation energy. Depth dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data support the band structure proposed to explain the photoluminescence results and also reveals the highest concentration of Sb at the sample surface suggesting a ‘floating layer’ of Sb during growth of the GaAs cap. Some of the implications of these results, for growth of quantum dot samples and for two novel solar cell proposals, the intermediate band and hot carrier solar cells, are discussed.

Abstract: Copper indium disulfide (CuInS2) thin films have been successfully prepared on Ni substrates using a novel one-step potentiostatic electrodeposition combined with a potassium hydrogen phthalate (C8H5KO4) complexing agent, accompanied by annealing at 350°C. Electrodeposition in the solution of Cu and In salts and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) containing an adequate concentration of C8H5KO4 (e.g., [C8H5KO4]=23mM) provides thin films comprised of a CuInS2 single phase as the bulk composition, without forming CuxS secondary phases. In addition to the effect on bulk-phase compositions, the adjustment of [C8H5KO4] causes variation in morphology and atomic composition of the film surface. The surface states of the films change from the Cu-rich rough surface at low [C8H5KO4] (15mM) to the In-rich smooth surface at high [C8H5KO4] (23mM). The higher [C8H5KO4] induces the grains constructing the film to interconnect and form a densely packed CuInS2 film without voids and pinholes. The single-phase and void-free CuInS2 film shows a band gap of 1.54eV, satisfying the requirement of the absorber layers in solar cells. The electrical properties tests denote its n-type conductivity with a resistivity of 9.6×10−5Ωcm, a carrier concentration of 2.9×1021cm−3 and a carrier mobility of 22.2cm2V−1s−1.

Abstract: We have studied hybrid solar cells based on the polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and colloidal CdSe nanocrystals. Using CdSe nanospheres with varying size, we have found that the power conversion efficiency (ηP) of these devices increases monotonically with the CdSe nanocrystal size, from ηP=(0.39±0.04)% under AM1.5G solar illumination for 4.0±0.2nm size nanospheres to ηP=(1.9±0.2)% for 6.8±0.5nm size nanospheres. The efficiency increase with nanocrystal size is mostly due to a significant increase in the short-circuit current, whereas the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the solar cells are less affected. The devices also exhibit abnormal initial aging behavior when exposed to air, as an increase in both the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage during the first 30min leads to a significant increase in ηP.

Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) and the polymer applied (MEH-PPV or P3HT) on the photovoltaic properties of TCO/TiO2/polymer/Ag bi-layer solar cells. The solar cells were analyzed under inert atmosphere conditions resembling an encapsulated or sealed device. We demonstrate that the substrate applied, ITO or FTO, modifies the crystalline structure of the TiO2: on an ITO substrate, TiO2 is present in its anatase phase, on an FTO, the rutile phase predominates. Devices fabricated on an FTO, where the rutile phase is present, show better stability under inert atmospheres than devices fabricated on an ITO, anatase phase. With respect to the polymer, devices based on MEH-PPV show higher Voc (as high as 1V), while the application of P3HT results in lower Voc, but higher Jsc and longer device stability. These observations have been associated to (a), the crystalline structure of TiO2 and (b) to the form the polymer is bonded to the TiO2 surface. In-situ IPCE analyses of P3HT-based solar cells show a red shift on the peak corresponding to TiO2, which is not present on the MEH-PPV-based solar cells. The latter suggest that P3HT can be linked to the TiO2 though the S-end atom, which results in devices with lower Voc. All these observations are also valid for devices, where the bare TiO2 is replaced by an Nb–TiO2. The application of an Nb–TiO2 with rutile structure in these polymer/oxide solar cells is the reason for their higher stability under inert atmospheres. We conclude that the application of TiO2 in its rutile phase is beneficial for long-term stability devices. Moreover there is an interplay between low Voc and Jsc in devices applying P3HT, since power conversion efficiency can be partially canceled by their lower Voc in comparison with MEH-PPV. These findings are important for polymer/oxide solar cells, but also for organic solar cells, where a layer of semiconductor oxides are in direct contact with a polymer, like in an inverted or tandem organic solar cells.

Abstract: Studies in yeast indicate that three specialized endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways, namely ERAD-L, -M, or -C, dispose substrates with structural lesions in the lumenal, transmembrane, or cytosolic domains, respectively. The ubiquitin ligase (E3) Hrd1p and its cooperating partners are required for ERAD-L and -M pathways, whereas Doa10p complex is required for the ERAD-C pathway. We investigated these pathways in mammalian cells by assessing the requirements of the mammalian ERAD E3s, gp78 and Hrd1, in degradation of four substrates each with different type of structural lesions: CD3δ, Z-variant α1-antitrypsin, tyrosinase (C89R) and mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTRΔF508). We demonstrated that tyrosinase (C89R) is a substrate for Hrd1 while all others are gp78 substrates. Knockdown of Hrd1 diminished gp78 substrate levels, but silencing of gp78 had no effect on Hrd1's substrate, suggesting that the functional interaction between Hrd1 and gp78 is unidirectional. Furthermore, while Ufd1 is dispensable for gp78-mediated ERAD, it is essential for Hrd1-mediated ERAD. Interestingly, Npl4 was found to be a key component for both pathways. These results suggest that the Hrd1-mediated ERAD requires a well-established retrotranslocation machinery, the p97/VCP–Ufd1–Npl4 complex, whereas the gp78 pathway needs only p97/VCP and Npl4. In addition, the three distinct ERAD pathways described in yeast may not be strictly conserved in mammalian cells as gp78 can function on three substrates with different structural lesions.
