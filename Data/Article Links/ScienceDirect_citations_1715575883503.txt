Abstract: After herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, the cytosolic sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) recognizes DNA and catalyzes synthesis of the second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP. cGAMP binds to the ER-localized adaptor protein MITA (also known as STING) to activate downstream antiviral responses. Conversely, HSV-1-encoded proteins evade antiviral immune responses via a wide variety of delicate mechanisms, promoting viral replication and pathogenesis. Here, we identified HSV-1 envelop protein UL56 as a negative regulator of cGAS-mediated innate immune responses. Overexpression of UL56 inhibited double-stranded DNA-triggered antiviral responses, whereas UL56-deficiency increased HSV-1-triggered induction of downstream antiviral genes. UL56-deficiency inhibited HSV-1 replication in wild-type but not MITA-deficient cells. UL56-deficient HSV-1 showed reduced replication in the brain of infected mice and was less lethal to infected mice. Mechanistically, UL56 interacted with cGAS and inhibited its DNA binding and enzymatic activity. Furthermore, we found that UL56 homologous proteins from different herpesviruses had similar roles in antagonizing cGAS-mediated innate immune responses. Our findings suggest that UL56 is a component of HSV-1 evasion of host innate immune responses by antagonizing the DNA sensor cGAS, which contributes to our understanding of the comprehensive mechanisms of immune evasion by herpesviruses.

Abstract: The yield of primary synovial mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is highly variable, but cell transplantation therapy with autologous synovial MSCs requires accurate prediction of the synovial MSC yield per synovium weight. Here, we determined whether the yield of synovial fluid MSCs might predict the ultimate yield of primary MSCs from the synovium of RA knees. Synovial fluid and synovium were harvested during total knee arthroplasty from the knee joints of 10 patients with RA. Synovial fluid (1.5 mL) was diluted fourfold and plated equally into six 60 cm2 dishes. Nucleated cells from digested synovium were similarly plated at 1 × 104 cells in 6 dishes. All dishes were cultured for 14 days and analyzed for MSC yields and properties, including in vitro chondrogenesis. The cultured synovial cell number was correlated with the cultured synovial fluid cell number (n = 10, R2 = 0.64, p < 0.01). Synovial fluid cells formed cell colonies and showed MSC-like surface epitopes and multi-differentiation potential. However, the cartilage pellet weight indicated a greater chondrogenic potential of the synovial MSCs (n = 8). The primary MSC yields from synovial fluid and synovium were correlated, indicating that the synovial fluid MSC yield can predict the ultimate synovial MSC yield.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 has a broad mammalian species tropism infecting humans, cats, dogs, and farmed mink. Since the start of the 2019 pandemic, several reverse zoonotic outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have occurred in mink, one of which reinfected humans and caused a cluster of infections in Denmark. Here we investigate the molecular basis of mink and ferret adaptation and demonstrate the spike mutations Y453F, F486L, and N501T all specifically adapt SARS-CoV-2 to use mustelid ACE2. Furthermore, we risk assess these mutations and conclude mink-adapted viruses are unlikely to pose an increased threat to humans, as Y453F attenuates the virus replication in human cells and all three mink adaptations have minimal antigenic impact. Finally, we show that certain SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging from circulation in humans may naturally have a greater propensity to infect mustelid hosts and therefore these species should continue to be surveyed for reverse zoonotic infections.

Abstract: Summary
We test the hypothesis that glioblastoma harbors quiescent cancer stem cells that evade anti-proliferative therapies. Functional characterization of spontaneous glioblastomas from genetically engineered mice reveals essential quiescent stem-like cells that can be directly isolated from tumors. A derived quiescent cancer-stem-cell-specific gene expression signature is enriched in pre-formed patient GBM xenograft single-cell clusters that lack proliferative gene expression. A refined human 118-gene signature is preserved in quiescent single-cell populations from primary and recurrent human glioblastomas. The F3 cell-surface receptor mRNA, expressed in the conserved signature, identifies quiescent tumor cells by antibody immunohistochemistry. F3-antibody-sorted glioblastoma cells exhibit stem cell gene expression, enhance self-renewal in culture, drive tumor initiation and serial transplantation, and reconstitute tumor heterogeneity. Upon chemotherapy, the spared cancer stem cell pool becomes activated and accelerates transition to proliferation. These results help explain conventional treatment failure and lay a conceptual framework for alternative therapies.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are transcribed as long primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II. Plant pri-miRNAs encode regulatory peptides called miPEPs, which specifically enhance the transcription of the pri-miRNA from which they originate. However, paradoxically, whereas miPEPs have been identified in different plant species, they are poorly conserved, raising the question of the mechanisms underlying their specificity. To address this point, we identify and re-annotate multiple Arabidopsis thaliana pri-miRNAs in order to identify ORF encoding miPEPs. The study of several identified miPEPs in different species show that non-conserved miPEPs are only active in their plant of origin, whereas conserved ones are active in different species. Finally, we find that miPEP activity relies on the presence of its own miORF, explaining both the lack of selection pressure on miPEP sequence and the ability for non-conserved peptides to play a similar role, i.e., to activate the expression of their corresponding miRNA.

Abstract: Summary
During female meiosis I (MI), spindle positioning must be tightly regulated to ensure the fidelity of the first asymmetric division and faithful chromosome segregation. Although the role of F-actin in regulating these critical processes has been studied extensively, little is known about whether microtubules (MTs) participate in regulating these processes. Using mouse oocytes as a model system, we characterize a subset of MT organizing centers that do not contribute directly to spindle assembly, termed mcMTOCs. Using laser ablation, STED super-resolution microscopy, and chemical manipulation, we show that mcMTOCs are required to regulate spindle positioning and faithful chromosome segregation during MI. We discuss how forces exerted by F-actin on the spindle are balanced by mcMTOC-nucleated MTs to anchor the spindle centrally and to regulate its timely migration. Our findings provide a model for asymmetric cell division, complementing the current F-actin-based models, and implicate mcMTOCs as a major player in regulating spindle positioning.

Abstract: Summary
In the eukaryotic cytosol, the Hsp70 and the Hsp90 chaperone machines work in tandem with the maturation of a diverse array of client proteins. The transfer of nonnative clients between these systems is essential to the chaperoning process, but how it is regulated is still not clear. We discovered that NudC is an essential transfer factor with an unprecedented mode of action: NudC interacts with Hsp40 in Hsp40-Hsp70-client complexes and displaces Hsp70. Then, the interaction of NudC with Hsp90 allows the direct transfer of Hsp40-bound clients to Hsp90 for further processing. Consistent with this mechanism, NudC increases client activation in vitro as well as in cells and is essential for cellular viability. Together, our results show the complexity of the cooperation between the major chaperone machineries in the eukaryotic cytosol.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota benefits the host by limiting enteric pathogen expansion (colonization resistance), partially via the production of inhibitory metabolites. Propionate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by microbiota members, is proposed to mediate colonization resistance against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm). Here, we show that S. Tm overcomes the inhibitory effects of propionate by using it as a carbon source for anaerobic respiration. We determine that propionate metabolism provides an inflammation-dependent colonization advantage to S. Tm during infection. Such benefit is abolished in the intestinal lumen of Salmonella-infected germ-free mice. Interestingly, S. Tm propionate-mediated intestinal expansion is restored when germ-free mice are monocolonized with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta), a prominent propionate producer in the gut, but not when mice are monocolonized with a propionate-production-deficient B. theta strain. Taken together, our results reveal a strategy used by S. Tm to mitigate colonization resistance by metabolizing microbiota-derived propionate

Abstract: Summary
The tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate, TAK-003, induces a functional antibody response, but the titers of antibodies against the four serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV) can vary. Here, through a transcriptomic analysis on whole blood collected from recipients of a two-dose schedule of TAK-003, we examine gene expression, splicing, and transcript isoform-level changes for both protein-coding and noncoding genes to broaden our understanding of the immune response. Our analysis reveals a dynamic pattern of vaccine-associated regulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), differential splicing of interferon-stimulated gene exons, and gene expression changes related to multiple signaling pathways that detect viral infection. Co-expression networks isolate immune cell-type-related and interferon-response modules that represent specific biological processes that correlate with more robust antibody responses. These data provide insights into the early determinants of the variable immune response to the vaccine, highlighting the significance of splicing and isoform-level gene regulatory mechanisms in defining vaccine immunogenicity.

Abstract: Summary
We determine that type I interferon (IFN) response biomarkers are enriched in a subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors; however, actionable vulnerabilities associated with IFN signaling have not been systematically defined. Integration of a phosphoproteomic analysis and a chemical genomics synergy screen reveals that IFN activates the replication stress response kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) in PDAC cells and sensitizes them to ATR inhibitors. IFN triggers cell-cycle arrest in S-phase, which is accompanied by nucleotide pool insufficiency and nucleoside efflux. In combination with IFN, ATR inhibitors induce lethal DNA damage and downregulate nucleotide biosynthesis. ATR inhibition limits the growth of PDAC tumors in which IFN signaling is driven by stimulator of interferon genes (STING). These results identify a cross talk between IFN, DNA replication stress response networks, and nucleotide metabolism while providing the rationale for targeted therapeutic interventions that leverage IFN signaling in tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammasome activation exacerbates infectious disease caused by pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although these pathogens activate host inflammasomes to regulate pathogen expansion, the mechanisms by which pathogen toxins contribute to inflammasome activation remain poorly understood. Here we show that activation of inflammasomes by Listeria infection is promoted by amino acid residue T223 of listeriolysin O (LLO) independently of its pore-forming activity. LLO T223 is critical for phosphorylation of the inflammasome adaptor ASC at amino acid residue Y144 through Lyn-Syk signaling, which is essential for ASC oligomerization. Notably, a Listeria mutant expressing LLO T223A is impaired in inducing ASC phosphorylation and inflammasome activation. Furthermore, the virulence of LLO T223A mutant is markedly attenuated in vivo due to impaired ability to activate the inflammasome. Our results reveal a function of a pathogen toxin that exacerbates infection by promoting phosphorylation of ASC.

Abstract: Summary
How do neuronal subtypes emerge during development? Recent molecular studies have profiled existing neuronal diversity, but neuronal subtype genesis remains elusive. The 15 types of mouse retinal bipolar interneurons are characterized by distinct functions, morphologies, and transcriptional profiles. Here, we develop a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of bipolar subtype genesis in the murine retina. Combining multiplexed detection of 16 RNA markers with timed delivery of 5-ethynyl uridine (EdU) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), we analyze more than 30,000 single cells in full retinal sections to classify all bipolar subtypes and their birthdates. We find that bipolar subtype birthdates are ordered and follow a centrifugal developmental axis. Spatial analysis reveals a striking wave pattern of bipolar subtype birthdates, and lineage analyses suggest clonal restriction on homotypic subtype production. These results inspire a hierarchical developmental model, with ordered subtype genesis within lineages. Our results provide insight into neuronal subtype development and establish a framework for studying subtype diversification.

Abstract: Summary
Nanoparticle (NP) vaccine formulations promote immune responses through multiple mechanisms. We recently reported that mannose-binding lectin (MBL) triggers trafficking of glycosylated HIV Env-immunogen NPs to lymph node follicles. Here, we investigate effects of MBL and complement on NP forms of HIV and other viral antigens. MBL recognition of oligomannose on gp120 nanoparticles significantly increases antigen accumulation in lymph nodes and antigen-specific germinal center (GC) responses. MBL and complement also mediate follicular trafficking and enhance GC responses to influenza, HBV, and HPV particulate antigens. Using model protein nanoparticles bearing titrated levels of glycosylation, we determine that mannose patches at a minimal density of 2.1 × 10−3 mannose patches/nm2 are required to trigger follicular targeting, which increases with increasing glycan density up to at least ∼8.2 × 10−3 patches/nm2. Thus, innate immune recognition of glycans has a significant impact on humoral immunity, and these findings provide a framework for engineering glycan recognition to optimize vaccine efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
How the splicing machinery defines exons or introns as the spliced unit has remained a puzzle for 30 years. Here, we demonstrate that peripheral and central regions of the nucleus harbor genes with two distinct exon-intron GC content architectures that differ in the splicing outcome. Genes with low GC content exons, flanked by long introns with lower GC content, are localized in the periphery, and the exons are defined as the spliced unit. Alternative splicing of these genes results in exon skipping. In contrast, the nuclear center contains genes with a high GC content in the exons and short flanking introns. Most splicing of these genes occurs via intron definition, and aberrant splicing leads to intron retention. We demonstrate that the nuclear periphery and center generate different environments for the regulation of alternative splicing and that two sets of splicing factors form discrete regulatory subnetworks for the two gene architectures. Our study connects 3D genome organization and splicing, thus demonstrating that exon and intron definition modes of splicing occur in different nuclear regions.

Abstract: Summary
Homologous recombination is essential to maintain genome stability in response to DNA damage. Here, we have used genome-wide sequencing to quantitatively analyze at nucleotide resolution the dynamics of DNA end resection, re-synthesis, and gene conversion at a double-strand break. Resection initiates asymmetrically in an MRX-independent manner before proceeding steadily in both directions. Sgs1, Exo1, Rad51, and Srs2 differently regulate the rate and symmetry of early and late resection. Exo1 also ensures the coexistence of resection and re-synthesis, while Srs2 guarantees a constant and symmetrical DNA re-polymerization. Gene conversion is MMR independent, spans only a minor fraction of the resected region, and its unidirectionality depends on Srs2. Finally, these repair factors prevent the development of alterations remote from the DNA lesion, such as subtelomeric instability, duplication of genomic regions, and over-replication of Ty elements. Altogether, this approach allows a quantitative analysis and a direct genome-wide visualization of DNA repair by homologous recombination.

Abstract: Summary
The heterogeneous therapy response observed in colorectal cancer is in part due to cancer stem cells (CSCs) that resist chemotherapeutic insults. The anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL plays a critical role in protecting CSCs from cell death, where its inhibition with high doses of BH3 mimetics can induce apoptosis. Here, we screen a compound library for synergy with low-dose BCL-XL inhibitor A-1155463 to identify pathways that regulate sensitivity to BCL-XL inhibition and reveal that fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)4 inhibition effectively sensitizes to A-1155463 both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we identify a rescue response that is activated upon BCL-XL inhibition and leads to rapid FGF2 secretion and subsequent FGFR4-mediated post-translational stabilization of MCL-1. FGFR4 inhibition prevents MCL-1 upregulation and thereby sensitizes CSCs to BCL-XL inhibition. Altogether, our findings suggest a cell transferable induction of a FGF2/FGFR4 rescue response in CRC that is induced upon BCL-XL inhibition and leads to MCL-1 upregulation.

Abstract: Summary
In mice, retinal direction selectivity is organized in a map that aligns to the body and gravitational axes of optic flow, and little is known about how this map develops. We find direction selectivity maps are largely present at eye opening and develop normally in the absence of visual experience. Remarkably, in mice lacking the beta2 subunit of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (β2-nAChR-KO), which exhibit drastically reduced cholinergic retinal waves in the first postnatal week, selectivity to horizontal motion is absent while selectivity to vertical motion remains. We tested several possible mechanisms that could explain the loss of horizontal direction selectivity in β2-nAChR-KO mice (wave propagation bias, FRMD7 expression, starburst amacrine cell morphology), but all were found to be intact when compared with WT mice. This work establishes a role for retinal waves in the development of asymmetric circuitry that mediates retinal direction selectivity via an unknown mechanism.

Transcription is orchestrated by thousands of transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin-associated proteins, but how these are causally connected to transcriptional activation is poorly understood. Here, we conduct an unbiased proteome-scale screen to systematically uncover human proteins that activate transcription in a natural chromatin context. By combining interaction proteomics and chemical inhibitors, we delineate the preference of these transcriptional activators for specific co-activators, highlighting how even closely related TFs can function via distinct cofactors. We also identify potent transactivation domains among the hits and use AlphaFold2 to predict and experimentally validate interaction interfaces of two activation domains with BRD4. Finally, we show that many novel activators are partners in fusion events in tumors and functionally characterize a myofibroma-associated fusion between SRF and C3orf62, a potent p300-dependent activator. Our work provides a functional catalog of potent transactivators in the human proteome and a platform for discovering transcriptional regulators at genome scale.

Abstract: We compared the effects of two ladder-based resistance training (LRT) protocols on the skeletal muscle morphology (biceps brachialis and plantaris) of Wistar rats. Also, we correlated the training parameters with the muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA). After maximum load tests (ML), twenty-nine young adult Wistar rats were divided into: CONTROL (n = 9), LIMITED (n = 10, 6–8 climb [2 × 50 %ML, 2 × 75 %ML, 2 × 100 %ML, and 2 × 100 %ML+30 g]) and UNLIMITED (n = 10, ≥4 climbs [50 %ML, 75 %ML, 90 %ML, 100 %ML + 30 g until failure) LRT. After eight weeks, the main results were: 1) For biceps brachialis, the type I, IIa, and mean fCSA was statistically larger in the LIMITED than CONTROL. The nuclei/fiber ratio was statistically higher in the LIMITED and UNLIMITED. The correlations found between total load, absolute delta load, and relative load and fCSA were moderate. 2) For plantaris, the type I, IIa, IIx/b, and mean fCSA was statistically larger in the LIMITED than CONTROL. The type IIa, IIx/b, and mean fCSA was statistically larger in the UNLIMITED than CONTROL. The nuclei/fiber ratio was statistically higher in both trained groups than CONTROL. The correlation between the climbing number, total load, and the fCSA was moderate. The correlation between delta absolute load and fCSA was strong. We concluded that rodents submitted to high-intensity, high-volume LRT, but limited climbing volume per session, presented more significant type I, IIa, IIx/b, and mean fCSA, higher nuclei/fiber ratio, and greater maximum carrying capacity. Also, muscle hypertrophy correlated positively with the load progression, training volume, and total load.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue insulin resistance are major drivers of metabolic disease. To uncover pathways involved in insulin resistance, specifically in these tissues, we leveraged the metabolic diversity of different dietary exposures and discrete inbred mouse strains. This revealed that muscle insulin resistance was driven by gene-by-environment interactions and was strongly correlated with hyperinsulinemia and decreased levels of ten key glycolytic enzymes. Remarkably, there was no relationship between muscle and adipose tissue insulin action. Adipocyte size profoundly varied across strains and diets, and this was strongly correlated with adipose tissue insulin resistance. The A/J strain, in particular, exhibited marked adipocyte insulin resistance and hypertrophy despite robust muscle insulin responsiveness, challenging the role of adipocyte hypertrophy per se in systemic insulin resistance. These data demonstrate that muscle and adipose tissue insulin resistance can occur independently and underscore the need for tissue-specific interrogation to understand metabolic disease.

Abstract: Summary
CD21low age-associated or atypical memory B cells are autoantibody enriched and poised for plasma cell differentiation. These cells overaccumulate in chronic infections, autoimmune disease, and immunodeficiency, posing the question of what checkpoints normally oppose their accumulation. Here, we reveal a critical role for paralogous calcium-NFAT-regulated transcription factors EGR2 and EGR3 that are induced in self-reactive B cells. CD21low and B1 B cells lacking EGR2 and EGR3 accumulate and circulate in young mice in numbers 10- to 20-fold greater than normal and overexpress a large set of EGR2 ChIP-seq target genes, including known drivers of plasma cell differentiation. Most follicular B cells constitutively express Egr2 proportionally to surface IgM downregulation by self-antigens, and EGR2/3 deficiency abolishes this cardinal feature of B cell anergy. These results explain the cardinal features of B cell anergy, define a key transcriptional checkpoint repressing CD21low B cell formation, and inform how NFATC1 or EGR2 mutations promote B1 cell-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemias.

Abstract: Summary
Translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC) is a poorly characterized subtype of kidney cancer driven by MiT/TFE gene fusions. Here, we define the landmarks of tRCC through an integrative analysis of 152 patients with tRCC identified across genomic, clinical trial, and retrospective cohorts. Most tRCCs harbor few somatic alterations apart from MiT/TFE fusions and homozygous deletions at chromosome 9p21.3 (19.2% of cases). Transcriptionally, tRCCs display a heightened NRF2-driven antioxidant response that is associated with resistance to targeted therapies. Consistently, we find that outcomes for patients with tRCC treated with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) are worse than those treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Using multiparametric immunofluorescence, we find that the tumors are infiltrated with CD8+ T cells, though the T cells harbor an exhaustion immunophenotype distinct from that of clear cell RCC. Our findings comprehensively define the clinical and molecular features of tRCC and may inspire new therapeutic hypotheses.

Abstract: Summary
Candida albicans is both a commensal and an opportunistic fungal pathogen. Invading hyphae of C. albicans secrete candidalysin, a pore-forming peptide toxin. To prevent cell death, epithelial cells must protect themselves from direct damage induced by candidalysin and by the mechanical forces exerted by expanding hyphae. We identify two key Ca2+-dependent repair mechanisms employed by epithelial cells to withstand candidalysin-producing hyphae. Using camelid nanobodies, we demonstrate candidalysin secretion directly into the invasion pockets induced by elongating C. albicans hyphae. The toxin induces oscillatory increases in cytosolic [Ca2+], which cause hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and loss of cortical actin. Epithelial cells dispose of damaged membrane regions containing candidalysin by an Alg-2/Alix/ESCRT-III-dependent blebbing process. At later stages, plasmalemmal tears induced mechanically by invading hyphae are repaired by exocytic insertion of lysosomal membranes. These two repair mechanisms maintain epithelial integrity and prevent mucosal damage during both commensal growth and infection by C. albicans.

Abstract: MicroRNA (miRNA) is vital to the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thereinto, miR-369-5p could yield assorted effects on various cancers, but there are few reports concerning the effect of miR-369-5p on HCC. Thus this study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of miR-369-5p in HCC. The data of miR-369-5p and HOXA13 expressions in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) were analyzed by starBase, and then the miR-369-5p expression in HCC tissues and cells was detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Subsequently, miR-369-5p mimic was transfected into HCC cells and then its effects on cell activities were evaluated by cell counting kit-8, colony formation, wound healing, transwell assays, respectively. Expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes were determined by western blot. The targeting relationship between miR-369-5p and HOXA13 was predicted by Targetscan and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Pearson correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between HOXA13 and miR-369-5p. The above assays were experimented again to investigate the effects of HOXA13 on biological activity and EMT of HCC cells. MiR-369-5p expression was down-regulated and HOXA13 expression was up-regulated in LIHC. MiR-369-5p targeted HOXA13 and the expression of miR-369-5p was negatively correlated with the HOXA13 expression. MiR-369-5p inhibited the viability, proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells, increased E-cadherin level and decreased N-cadherin and Vimentin expressions. Concurrently, HOXA13 overexpression could counteract the effects of miR-369-5p on biological activity and EMT-related biomarkers of HCC cells. To conclude, miR-369-5p inhibits the viability, proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells by repressing the expression of HOXA13.

Abstract: Summary
The protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network (PN) encompasses mechanisms that maintain proteome integrity by controlling various biological functions. Loss of proteostasis leads to toxic protein aggregation (proteotoxicity), which underlies the manifestation of neurodegeneration. How the PN responds to dissimilar proteotoxic challenges and how these responses are regulated at the organismal level are largely unknown. Here, we report that, while torsin chaperones protect from the toxicity of neurodegeneration-causing polyglutamine stretches, they exacerbate the toxicity of the Alzheimer’s disease-causing Aβ peptide in neurons and muscles. These opposing effects are accompanied by differential modulations of gene expression, including that of three neuropeptides that are involved in tailoring the organismal response to dissimilar proteotoxic insults. This mechanism is regulated by insulin/IGF signaling and the transcription factor SKN-1/NRF. Our work delineates a mechanism by which the PN orchestrates differential responses to dissimilar proteotoxic challenges and points at potential targets for therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Concerns that infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may cause new-onset diabetes persist in an evolving research landscape, and precise risk assessment is hampered by, at times, conflicting evidence. Here, leveraging comprehensive single-cell analyses of in vitro SARS-CoV-2-infected human pancreatic islets, we demonstrate that productive infection is strictly dependent on the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and targets practically all pancreatic cell types. Importantly, the infection remains highly circumscribed and largely non-cytopathic and, despite a high viral burden in infected subsets, promotes only modest cellular perturbations and inflammatory responses. Similar experimental outcomes are also observed after islet infection with endemic coronaviruses. Thus, the limits of pancreatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, even under in vitro conditions of enhanced virus exposure, challenge the proposition that in vivo targeting of β cells by SARS-CoV-2 precipitates new-onset diabetes. Whether restricted pancreatic damage and immunological alterations accrued by COVID-19 increase cumulative diabetes risk, however, remains to be evaluated.

Abstract: Summary
Selective autophagy is a catabolic route that turns over specific cellular material for degradation by lysosomes, and whose role in the regulation of innate immunity is largely unexplored. Here, we show that the apical kinase of the Drosophila immune deficiency (IMD) pathway Tak1, as well as its co-activator Tab2, are both selective autophagy substrates that interact with the autophagy protein Atg8a. We also present a role for the Atg8a-interacting protein Sh3px1 in the downregulation of the IMD pathway, by facilitating targeting of the Tak1/Tab2 complex to the autophagy platform through its interaction with Tab2. Our findings show the Tak1/Tab2/Sh3px1 interactions with Atg8a mediate the removal of the Tak1/Tab2 signaling complex by selective autophagy. This in turn prevents constitutive activation of the IMD pathway in Drosophila. This study provides mechanistic insight on the regulation of innate immune responses by selective autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Plants respond to higher temperatures by the action of heat stress (HS) transcription factors (Hsfs), which control the onset, early response, and long-term acclimation to HS. Members of the HsfA1 subfamily, such as tomato HsfA1a, are the central regulators of HS response, and their activity is fine-tuned by other Hsfs. We identify tomato HsfA7 as capacitor of HsfA1a during the early HS response. Upon a mild temperature increase, HsfA7 is induced in an HsfA1a-dependent manner. The subsequent interaction of the two Hsfs prevents the stabilization of HsfA1a resulting in a negative feedback mechanism. Under prolonged or severe HS, HsfA1a and HsfA7 complexes stimulate the induction of genes required for thermotolerance. Therefore, HsfA7 exhibits a co-repressor mode at mild HS by regulating HsfA1a abundance to moderate the upregulation of HS-responsive genes. HsfA7 undergoes a temperature-dependent transition toward a co-activator of HsfA1a to enhance the acquired thermotolerance capacity of tomato plants.

Abstract: Summary
Genetically encoded biosensors are powerful tools to monitor cellular behavior, but the difficulty in generating appropriate reporters for chromatin factors hampers our ability to dissect epigenetic pathways. Here, we present TRACE (transgene reporters across chromatin environments), a high-throughput, genome-wide technique to generate fluorescent human reporter cell lines responsive to manipulation of epigenetic factors. By profiling GFP expression from a large pool of individually barcoded lentiviral integrants in the presence and absence of a perturbation, we identify reporters responsive to pharmacological inhibition of the histone lysine demethylase LSD1 and genetic ablation of the PRC2 subunit SUZ12. Furthermore, by manipulating the HIV-1 host factor LEDGF through targeted deletion or fusion to chromatin reader domains, we alter lentiviral integration site preferences, thus broadening the types of chromatin examined by TRACE. The phenotypic reporters generated through TRACE will allow the genetic interrogation of a broad range of epigenetic pathways, furthering our mechanistic understanding of chromatin biology.

Abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a primary biliary epithelium malignancy with limited therapies, poor prognosis and high mortality rate. Nowadays, the molecular mechanisms of CCA remain elusive. SPARC has been proposed to be highly expressed in clinical CCA tissues, but few studies has been elucidated its functions in CCA. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the functional role of SPARC in the progression of CCA. In this study, a significantly increased expression of SPARC was observed in CCA tissues and cells. Knockdown of SPARC by RNA interference significantly impeded the proliferation of CCA cells. Moreover, SPARC silencing hampered the migration and invasion of CCA cells by inhibiting EMT. In parallel, overexpression of SPARC in RBE cells had the opposite effects. Mechanically, SPARC promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT of CCA cells in vitro via activating the PI3K-AKT signaling. Overall, our integrated analysis revealed that SPARC plays a crucial role in CCA progression via the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which suggests that targeting SPARC might represent a promising approach for improving CCA patient’s clinical outcome.

Abstract: Summary
Exposing animals to an enriched environment (EE) has dramatic effects on brain structure, function, and plasticity. The poorly known “EE-derived signals'' mediating the EE effects are thought to be generated within the central nervous system. Here, we shift the focus to the body periphery, revealing that gut microbiota signals are crucial for EE-driven plasticity. Developmental analysis reveals striking differences in intestinal bacteria composition between EE and standard rearing (ST) mice, as well as enhanced levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in EE mice. Depleting the microbiota of EE mice with antibiotics strongly decreases SCFA and prevents activation of adult ocular dominance plasticity, spine dynamics, and microglia rearrangement. SCFA treatment in ST mice mimics EE induction of ocular dominance plasticity and microglial remodeling. Remarkably, transferring the microbiota of EE mice to ST recipients activates adult ocular dominance plasticity. Thus, experience-dependent changes in gut microbiota regulate brain plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic Kras induces a hyper-proliferative state that permits cells to progress to neoplasms in diverse epithelial tissues. Depending on the cell of origin, this also involves lineage transformation. Although a multitude of downstream factors have been implicated in these processes, the precise chronology of molecular events controlling them remains elusive. Using mouse models, primary human tissues, and cell lines, we show that, in Kras-mutant alveolar type II cells (AEC2), FOSL1-based AP-1 factor guides the mSWI/SNF complex to increase chromatin accessibility at genomic loci controlling the expression of genes necessary for neoplastic transformation. We identified two orthogonal processes in Kras-mutant distal airway club cells. The first promoted their transdifferentiation into an AEC2-like state through NKX2.1, and the second controlled oncogenic transformation through the AP-1 complex. Our results suggest that neoplasms retain an epigenetic memory of their cell of origin through cell-type-specific transcription factors. Our analysis showed that a cross-tissue-conserved AP-1-dependent chromatin remodeling program regulates carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial dysbiosis is a colorectal cancer (CRC) hallmark and contributes to inflammation, tumor growth, and therapy response. Gut microbes signal via metabolites, but how the metabolites impact CRC is largely unknown. We interrogated fecal metabolites associated with mouse models of colon tumorigenesis with varying mutational load. We find that microbial metabolites from healthy mice or humans are growth-repressive, and this response is attenuated in mice and patients with CRC. Microbial profiling reveals that Lactobacillus reuteri and its metabolite, reuterin, are downregulated in mouse and human CRC. Reuterin alters redox balance, and reduces proliferation and survival in colon cancer cells. Reuterin induces selective protein oxidation and inhibits ribosomal biogenesis and protein translation. Exogenous Lactobacillus reuteri restricts colon tumor growth, increases tumor reactive oxygen species, and decreases protein translation in vivo. Our findings indicate that a healthy microbiome and specifically, Lactobacillus reuteri, is protective against CRC through microbial metabolite exchange.

Abstract: In comparison with normal cells, cancer cells are equipped with a higher number of lysosomes, involved in degradative and non-degradative roles. In particular, the lysosome is a Ca2+signalling hub, and the enhancement of this interconnected machinery in cancer cells has recently prompted investigations into the role that lysosomal ion channels play in oncology. The present review reports findings about the emerging role of lysosomal Ca2+channels: Two-Pore Channels (TPCs), Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channels (TRPMLs; mucolipins), and Purinergic X Receptor 4 (P2×4R), in a variety of cancer models, highlighting their impact on crucial functions such as the regulation of autophagy and the composition of the tumour microenvironment, including the secretion-mediated interplay with immune and endothelial cells. Notably, recent evidence indicates that, by regulating tumour secretome, lysosomal Ca2+ signalling can affect the composition of the tumour-infiltrating immune cell repertoire. Intriguingly, the data so far available show that the protumoral/antitumoral role of lysosomal Ca2+ channels can differ according to the specific genetic context, types of cancer and the malignancy stage, and signals from the microenvironment.

Abstract: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of movement disorders in children. Next generation sequencing (NGS) studies have previously shown that expression levels are fundamentally different in children with CP compared to typically developing (TD). However, given that children are in full development, we might expect gene expression levels to change once maturity is reached. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to investigate gene expression levels of 93 target genes in adults with CP using NGS on muscle biopsies of the gastrocnemius, taken from 22 participants (n = 12 adults with CP; n = 10 TD adults). Subsequently, we carried out NGS of the mitochondrial genome to identify mtDNA variants, and additionally we studied the mitochondrial content using transmission electron microscopy images of the gastrocnemius muscle. Finally, we compared systemic ion levels between TD adults and adults with CP. Differential gene expression levels were found in genes involved in muscle contraction (MYH1 and MYBPC2), mitochondrial function kATP5J, CYCS and NDUFB6), calcium handling (CAMK2B and ATP2A), metabolism (LPL), muscle signaling (MYC, CREB1, ACVR2B, LMNA and TRIM54), and ECM (TNC). There was no statistical significant difference between CP and TD for mtDNA variant frequencies and mitochondrial content. The ion levels of Ca2+, Na+ and K+ were statistically significantly reduced while the Cl− levels were significant increased in adults with CP compared to TD adults. These results highlight that most transcriptional differences are related to muscle function in adults with CP and that mitochondrial function might be altered but not mitochondrial content.

Abstract: CACNA1E is a gene encoding the ion-conducting α1 subunit of R-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, whose roles in tumorigenesis remain to be determined. We previously showed that CACNA1E was significantly mutated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were long-term exposed to household air pollution, with a mutation rate of 19% (15 of 79 cases). Here we showed that CACNA1E was also mutated in 207 (12.8%) of the 1616 patients with NSCLC in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. At mRNA and protein levels, CACNA1E was elevated in tumor tissues compared to counterpart non-tumoral lung tissues in NSCLCs of the public datasets and our settings, and its expression level was inversely associated with clinical outcome of the patients. Overexpression of wild type (WT) or A275S or R249G mutant CACNA1E transcripts promoted NSCLC cell proliferation with activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway, whereas knockdown of this gene exerted inhibitory effects on NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. CACNA1E increased current density and Ca2+ entrance, whereas calcium channel blockers inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation. These data indicate that CACNA1E is required for NSCLC cell proliferation, and blockade of this oncoprotein may have therapeutic potentials for this deadly disease.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) display enhanced transmissibility and resistance to antibody neutralization. Comparing the early 2020 isolate EU-1 to the VOCs Alpha, Beta, and Gamma in mice transgenic for human ACE2 reveals that VOCs induce a broadened scope of symptoms, expand systemic infection to the gastrointestinal tract, elicit the depletion of natural killer cells, and trigger variant-specific cytokine production patterns. Gamma infections result in accelerated disease progression associated with increased immune activation and inflammation. All four SARS-CoV-2 variants induce pDC depletion in the lungs, paralleled by reduced interferon responses. Remarkably, VOCs also use the murine ACE2 receptor for infection to replicate in the lungs of wild-type animals, which induce cellular and innate immune responses that apparently curtail the spread of overt disease. VOCs thus display distinct intrinsic pathogenic properties with broadened tissue and host range. The enhanced pathogenicity of VOCs and their potential for reverse zoonotic transmission pose challenges to clinical and pandemic management.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, white adipose tissues are largely divided into visceral epididymal adipose tissue (EAT) and subcutaneous inguinal adipose tissue (IAT) with distinct metabolic properties. Although emerging evidence suggests that subpopulations of adipose stem cells (ASCs) would be important to explain fat depot differences, ASCs of two fat depots have not been comparatively investigated. Here, we characterized heterogeneous ASCs and examined the effects of intrinsic and tissue micro-environmental factors on distinct ASC features. We demonstrated that ASC subpopulations in EAT and IAT exhibited different molecular features with three adipogenic stages. ASC transplantation experiments revealed that intrinsic ASC features primarily determined their adipogenic potential. Upon obesogenic stimuli, EAT-specific SDC1+ ASCs promoted fibrotic remodeling, whereas IAT-specific CXCL14+ ASCs suppressed macrophage infiltration. Moreover, IAT-specific BST2high ASCs exhibited a high potential to become beige adipocytes. Collectively, our data broaden the understanding of ASCs with new insights into the origin of white fat depot differences.

Abstract: Summary
Alpha-synuclein (αS) is causally involved in the development of Parkinson disease (PD); however, its role in normal vertebrate physiology has remained unknown. Recent studies demonstrate that αS is induced by noroviral infection in the enteric nervous system of children and protects mice against lethal neurotropic viral infection. Additionally, αS is a potent chemotactic activator of phagocytes. In this report, using both wild-type and αS knockout mice, we show that αS is a critical mediator of inflammatory and immune responses. αS is required for the development of a normal inflammatory response to bacterial peptidoglycan introduced into the peritoneal cavity as well as antigen-specific and T cell responses following intraperitoneal immunization. Furthermore, we show that neural cells are the sources of αS required for immune competence. Our report supports the hypothesis that αS accumulates within the nervous system of PD individuals because of an inflammatory/immune response.

Abstract: Summary
The utility of the urinary proteome in infectious diseases remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the proteome and metabolome of urine and serum samples from patients with COVID-19 and healthy controls. Our data show that urinary proteins effectively classify COVID-19 by severity. We detect 197 cytokines and their receptors in urine, but only 124 in serum using TMT-based proteomics. The decrease in urinary ESCRT complex proteins correlates with active SARS-CoV-2 replication. The downregulation of urinary CXCL14 in severe COVID-19 cases positively correlates with blood lymphocyte counts. Integrative multiomics analysis suggests that innate immune activation and inflammation triggered renal injuries in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19-associated modulation of the urinary proteome offers unique insights into the pathogenesis of this disease. This study demonstrates the added value of including the urinary proteome in a suite of multiomics analytes in evaluating the immune pathobiology and clinical course of COVID-19 and, potentially, other infectious diseases.

Abstract: Objectives
Osteosarcoma is a relatively common primary malignant bone tumor in clinic, which frequently occurs in children and adolescents. It is essential to clarify the molecular mechanism of osteosarcoma to provide better diagnosis and treatment. Abnormal expression of miRNAs is closely related to the pathogenesis and progression of osteosarcoma. MiRNAs play a regulatory role in tumorigenesis and development of osteosarcoma. The purpose of this study is to reveal the working mechanism of miR-139/ITGAV axis in osteosarcoma progression.
Methods
ITGAV and miR-139 expression was detected in osteosarcoma tissues or paracancerous normal tissues. TargetScan and Double luciferase reporter gene assay were adopted to verify weather ITGAV was the target gene of miR-139. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to evaluate the effects of miR-139 on ITGAV. CCK8, Flow cytometry, Transwell and Cell wound scratch assay were used to measure the effects of miR-139 and ITGAV on cell cycle, proliferation, migration and invasion of MG63, respectively. A nude mouse xenograft model of cervical cancer was constructed to observe the effects of miR-139 on the tumor growth.
Results
We found that the expression of miR-139 in osteosarcoma tissue was significantly reduced, while the expression of ITGAV was significantly increased. MiR-139 could specifically bind to the 3'-UTR of ITGAV and negatively regulate its expression. Transfection of miR-139 mimic could inhibit the proliferation, S-phase arrest, invasion and migration of MG63 cells, and up-regulating the expression of ITGAV could reverse such inhibitory effect. In nude mouse xenograft model of osteosarcoma, overexpression of miR-139 could inhibit tumor growth, while down-regulation of miR-139 produced the opposite effect.
Conclusions
These results indicate that miR-139/ITGAV axis was related to osteosarcoma initiation. MiR-139 could inhibit the biological behavior of osteosarcoma cells and the tumor growth in nude mouse model via targeting ITGAV, and miR-139/ITGAV axis may impede the progression of osteosarcoma.

Abstract: Summary
Melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells, are replenished from multiple stem cell niches in adult tissue. Although pigmentation traits are known risk factors for melanoma, we know little about melanocyte stem cell (McSC) populations other than hair follicle McSCs and lack key lineage markers with which to identify McSCs and study their function. Here we find that Tfap2b and a select set of target genes specify an McSC population at the dorsal root ganglia in zebrafish. Functionally, Tfap2b is required for only a few late-stage embryonic melanocytes, and is essential for McSC-dependent melanocyte regeneration. Fate mapping data reveal that tfap2b+ McSCs have multifate potential, and are the cells of origin for large patches of adult melanocytes, two other pigment cell types (iridophores and xanthophores), and nerve-associated cells. Hence, Tfap2b confers McSC identity in early development, distinguishing McSCs from other neural crest and pigment cell lineages, and retains multifate potential in the adult zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of limbs evolved many times in squamate reptiles. Here we investigated the genomic basis of convergent limb loss in reptiles. We sequenced the genomes of a closely related pair of limbless-limbed gymnophthalmid lizards and performed a comparative genomic analysis including five snakes and the limbless glass lizard. Our analysis of these three independent limbless lineages revealed that signatures of shared sequence or transcription factor binding site divergence in individual limb regulatory elements are generally rare. Instead, shared divergence occurs more often at the level of signaling pathways, involving different regulatory elements associated with the same limb genes (such as Hand2 or Hox) and/or patterning mechanisms (such as Shh signaling). Interestingly, although snakes are known to have mutations in the Shh ZRS limb enhancer, this enhancer lacks relevant mutations in limbless lizards. Thus, different mechanisms could contribute to limb loss, and there are likely multiple evolutionary paths to limblessness in reptiles.

Abstract: Summary
The lipid droplet (LD) is a central hub for fatty acid metabolism in cells. Here we define the dynamics and explore the role of LDs in skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs), a stem cell population responsible for muscle regeneration. In newly divided SCs, LDs are unequally distributed in sister cells exhibiting asymmetric cell fates, as the LDLow cell self-renews while the LDHigh cell commits to differentiation. When transplanted into regenerating muscles, LDLow cells outperform LDHigh cells in self-renewal and regeneration in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of LD biogenesis or genetic inhibition of LD catabolism through knockout of Pnpla2 (encoding ATGL, the rate-limiting enzyme for lipolysis) disrupts cell fate homeostasis and impairs the regenerative capacity of SCs. Dysfunction of Pnpla2-null SCs is associated with energy insufficiency and oxidative stress that can be partially rescued by antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine) treatment. These results establish a direct link between LD dynamics and stem cell fate determination.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolism of activated macrophages relies on aerobic glycolysis, while mitochondrial oxidation is disrupted. In lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages, the citrate carrier (CIC) exports citrate from mitochondria to enhance glycolytic genes through histone acetylation. CIC inhibition or Slc25a1 knockdown reduces the occupancy of H3K9ac to hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) binding sites in promoters of glycolytic genes to restrain glycolysis. HIF-1α also transcriptionally upregulates immune-responsive gene 1 for itaconate production, which is inhibited by CIC blocking. Isotopic tracing of [U-13C6] glucose shows that CIC blockage prevents citrate accumulation and itaconate production by reducing glycolytic flux and facilitating metabolic flux in the TCA cycle. Isotopic tracing of [U-13C5] glutamine reveals that CIC inhibition reduces succinate accumulation from glutaminolysis and the gamma-aminobutyric acid shunt by enhancing mitochondrial oxidation. By restraining glycolysis, CIC inhibition increases NAD+ content to ensure mitochondrial biogenesis for oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, blockage of citrate export reduces cerebral thrombosis by inactivation of peripheral macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Successful host colonization by fungi in fluctuating niches requires response and adaptation to multiple environmental stresses. However, our understanding about how fungal species thrive in the gastrointestinal (GI) ecosystem by combing multifaceted nutritional stress with respect to homeostatic host-commensal interactions is still in its infancy. Here, we discover that depletion of the phosphate transceptor Pho84 across multiple fungal species encountered a substantial cost in gastrointestinal colonization. Mechanistically, Pho84 enhances the gastrointestinal commensalism via a dual-action activity, coordinating both phosphate uptake and TOR activation by induction of the transcriptional regulator Try4 and downstream commensalism-related transcription. As such, Pho84 promotes Candida albicans commensalism, but this does not translate into enhanced pathogenicity. Thus, our study uncovers a specific nutrient-dependent dual-action regulatory pathway for Pho84 on fungal commensalism.

Abstract: Following calcium-triggered vesicle exocytosis, endocytosis regenerates vesicles to maintain exocytosis and thus synaptic transmission, which underlies neuronal circuit activities. Although most molecules involved in endocytosis have been identified, it remains rather poorly understood how endocytic machinery regulates vesicle size. Vesicle size, together with the transmitter concentration inside the vesicle, determines the amount of transmitter the vesicle can release, the quantal size, that may control the strength of synaptic transmission. Here, we report that, surprisingly, knockout of the GTPase dynamin 1, the most abundant brain dynamin isoform known to catalyze fission of the membrane pit's neck (the last step of endocytosis), not only significantly slowed endocytosis but also increased the synaptic vesicle diameter by as much as ∼40–64% at cultured hippocampal synapses. Furthermore, dynamin 1 knockout increased the size of membrane pits, the precursor for endocytic vesicle formation. These results suggest an important function of dynamin other than its well-known fission function – control of vesicle size at the pit formation stage.

Abstract: An ultrastructural study of the gonadal wall in 10 sea star species from the orders Forcipulatida, Paxillosida, Spinulosida, Valvatida and Velatida has shown variations in the presence of myoepithelial cells in the visceral peritoneal epithelium. These cells have only been found in the peritoneal epithelium of the gonads in Aphelasterias japonica (Forcipulatida: Asteriidae), Asterias amurensis (Forcipulatida: Asteriidae), Distolasterias nipon (Forcipulatida: Asteriidae), Diplopteraster multipes (Velatida: Pterasteridae), Luidia quinaria (Paxillosida: Ctenodiscidae), and Pteraster sp. (Velatida: Pterasteridae). Our results may shed light on the evolution of peritoneal epithelium of sea star gonads. It is probable that, initially sea stars had myoepithelial cells in visceral peritoneal epithelium of the gonads. The species from the orders Forcipulatida and Velatida have retained this plesiomorphic state, while many species from the orders Paxillosida, Spinulosida and Valvatida have lost myoepithelial cells from visceral peritoneal epithelium of their gonads.

Abstract: Summary
Shoot regeneration is mediated by the sequential action of two phytohormones, auxin and cytokinin. However, the chromatin regulatory landscapes underlying this dynamic response have not yet been studied. In this study, we jointly profiled chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and transcriptomes to demonstrate that a high auxin/cytokinin ratio environment primes Arabidopsis shoot regeneration by increasing the accessibility of the gene loci associated with pluripotency and shoot fate determination. Cytokinin signaling not only triggers the commitment of the shoot progenitor at later stages but also allows chromatin to maintain shoot identity genes at the priming stage. Our analysis of transcriptional regulatory dynamics further identifies a catalog of regeneration cis-elements dedicated to cell fate transitions and uncovers important roles of BES1, MYC, IDD, and PIF transcription factors in shoot regeneration. Our results, thus, provide a comprehensive resource for studying cell reprogramming in plants and provide potential targets for improving future shoot regeneration efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
A mesenchymal tumor phenotype associates with immunotherapy resistance, although the mechanism is unclear. Here, we identified FBXO7 as a maintenance regulator of mesenchymal and immune evasion phenotypes of cancer cells. FBXO7 bound and stabilized SIX1 co-transcriptional regulator EYA2, stimulating mesenchymal gene expression and suppressing IFNα/β, chemokines CXCL9/10, and antigen presentation machinery, driven by AXL extracellular ligand GAS6. Ubiquitin ligase SCFFBXW7 antagonized this pathway by promoting EYA2 degradation. Targeting EYA2 Tyr phosphatase activity decreased mesenchymal phenotypes and enhanced cancer cell immunogenicity, resulting in attenuated tumor growth and metastasis, increased infiltration of cytotoxic T and NK cells, and enhanced anti-PD-1 therapy response in mouse tumor models. FBXO7 expression correlated with mesenchymal and immune-suppressive signatures in patients with cancer. An FBXO7-immune gene signature predicted immunotherapy responses. Collectively, the FBXO7/EYA2-SCFFBXW7 axis maintains mesenchymal and immune evasion phenotypes of cancer cells, providing rationale to evaluate FBXO7/EYA2 inhibitors in combination with immune-based therapies to enhance onco-immunotherapy responses.

Abstract: Human platelets regulate agonist-evoked Ca2+ signalling through Ca2+ release from and sequestration into acidic organelles. Previous studies have pharmacologically characterised the presence of a Ca2+-H+ exchanger in these organelles. This exchanger appears to regulate a secondary plateau phase in agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ signals in fura-2-loaded human platelets. Here we demonstrate that cytochalasin D treatment removes the secondary plateau in ADP-evoked Ca2+ signals elicited in the absence of external Ca2+. This effect was reversed by pretreatment with nigericin, a K+/H+ exchanger that short-circuits the Ca2+-H+ exchanger. Using Fluo-5N- or Lysosensor Green-loaded cells, cytochalasin D was found to enhance Ca2+ sequestration into acidic organelles by preventing their alkalinisation. Additional experiments demonstrated that ADP-evoked alkalinisation of acidic organelles and subsequent slowing of acidic organellar Ca2+ sequestration was mediated by autocrine 5-HT signalling. Enhancing this 5-HT signalling using fluoxetine overcame the inhibitory effect of cytochalasin D on ADP-evoked Ca2+ signals, indicating that cytochalasin D interferes with 5-HT autocrine signalling. The ability of Cytochalasin D to interfere with autocrine 5-HT signalling was downstream of the 5-HT2A receptor as secretion of [3H]-5-HT from ADP-stimulated human platelets was not reduced. These data provide the first evidence that the pH gradient across acidic organelles is dynamically regulated upon human platelet activation, and that this can play a significant role in controlling human platelet function by modulating Ca2+-H+ exchange and so [Ca2+]i.

Abstract: Summary
In mammalian sperm cells, regulation of spatiotemporal Ca2+ signaling relies on the quadrilinear Ca2+ signaling nanodomains in the flagellar membrane. The sperm-specific, multi-subunit CatSper Ca2+ channel, which is crucial for sperm hyperactivated motility and male fertility, organizes the nanodomains. Here, we report CatSperτ, the C2cd6-encoded membrane-associating C2 domain protein, can independently migrate to the flagella and serve as a major targeting component of the CatSper channel complex. CatSperτ loss of function in mice demonstrates that it is essential for sperm hyperactivated motility and male fertility. CatSperτ targets the CatSper channel into the quadrilinear nanodomains in the flagella of developing spermatids, whereas it is dispensable for functional channel assembly. CatSperτ interacts with ciliary trafficking machinery in a C2-dependent manner. These findings provide insights into the CatSper channel trafficking to the Ca2+ signaling nanodomains and the shared molecular mechanisms of ciliary and flagellar membrane targeting.

Abstract: Summary
Gastric bypass and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) remain the most potent and durable treatments for obesity and type 2 diabetes but are also associated with iron deficiency. The transcription factor HIF2α, which regulates iron absorption in the duodenum, increases following these surgeries. Increasing iron levels by means of dietary supplementation or hepatic hepcidin knockdown does not undermine the effects of VSG, indicating that metabolic improvements following VSG are not secondary to lower iron levels. Gut-specific deletion of Vhl results in increased constitutive duodenal HIF2α signaling and produces a profound lean, glucose-tolerant phenotype that mimics key effects of VSG. Interestingly, intestinal Vhl deletion also results in increased intestinal secretion of GLP-1, which is essential for these metabolic benefits. These data demonstrate a role for increased duodenal HIF2α signaling in regulating crosstalk between iron-regulatory systems and other aspects of systemic physiology important for metabolic regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial cells (ECs) are phenotypically heterogeneous, mainly due to their dynamic response to the tissue microenvironment. Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), the best-known angiogenic factor, activates calcium-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling following acute angiogenic gene transcription. Here, we evaluate the global mapping of VEGF-mediated dynamic transcriptional events, focusing on major histone-code profiles using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Remarkably, the gene loci of immediate-early angiogenic transcription factors (TFs) exclusively acquire bivalent H3K4me3-H3K27me3 double-positive histone marks after the VEGF stimulus. Moreover, NFAT-associated Pax transactivation domain-interacting protein (PTIP) directs bivalently marked TF genes transcription through a limited polymerase II running. The non-canonical polycomb1 variant PRC1.3 specifically binds to and allows the transactivation of PRC2-enriched bivalent angiogenic TFs until conventional PRC1-mediated gene silencing is achieved. Knockdown of these genes abrogates post-natal aberrant neovessel formation via the selective inhibition of indispensable bivalent angiogenic TF gene transcription. Collectively, the reported dynamic histone mark landscape may uncover the importance of immediate-early genes and the development of advanced anti-angiogenic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer heterogeneity and evolution are not fully understood. Here, we show that mitochondrial DNA of the normal liver shapes tumor progression, histology, and immune environment prior to the acquisition of oncogenic mutation. Using conplastic mice, we show that mtDNA dictates the expression of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in the normal liver. Activation of oncogenic mutations in UPRmt-positive liver increases tumor incidence and histological heterogeneity. Further, in a subset of UPRmt-positive mice, invasive liver cancers develop. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the normal liver reveals that, in this subset, the PAPP-A/DDR2/SNAIL axis of invasion pre-exists along with elevated collagen. Since PAPP-A promotes immune evasion, we analyzed the immune signature and found that their livers are immunosuppressed. Further, the PAPP-A signature identifies the immune exhausted subset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans. Our data suggest that mtDNA of normal liver shapes the entire liver cancer portrait upon acquisition of oncogenic mutations.

Abstract: Background: Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) is a new type of gene delivery technology. MiR-21-5p was highly expressed in a variety of cancers. In this paper, miR-21-5p inhibitor was transfected into lung cancer cells by UTMD to observe its role in lung cancer. Methods: StarBase was used to analyze the miR-21-5p expression in lung cancer patients and its relationship with the prognosis of the patients. MiR-21-5p expression in lung cancer tissues or cell lines was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Effects of gradient concentration (0, 5, 10, 20, 30%) of SonoVue or gradient mechanical index (MI) (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 W/cm2) on the cell viability were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The targeting relationship between miR-21-5p and B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2) was predicted by TargetScan and confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay, while the expressions of the two genes were determined by qRT-PCR. Through liposome transfection or UTMD transfection, the effects of miR-21-5p/BTG2 on the biological behaviors of lung cancer cells, the size of xenograft tumors and the expressions of ki67 and miR-21-5p were measured by qRT-PCR, western blot, cell function experiments and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results: MiR-21-5p expression was upregulated in lung cancer, which was associated with a poor prognosis. The optimal ultrasound conditions were 10% SonoVue concentration and 1 W/cm2. UTMD transfection exerted a stronger effect than liposome transfection. MiR-21-5p promoted cell viability, proliferation and migration yet suppressed apoptosis by targeting BTG2. MiR-21-5p inhibitor reduced the size and volume of xenograft tumor and the expressions of ki67 and miR-21-5p in xenograft tumor tissues.
Conclusion
UTMD-mediated miR-21-5p inhibitor can more effectively suppress the development of lung cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding vaccine-mediated protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical to overcoming the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We investigate mRNA-vaccine-induced antibody responses against the reference strain, seven variants, and seasonal coronaviruses in 168 healthy individuals at three time points: before vaccination, after the first dose, and after the second dose. Following complete vaccination, both naive and previously infected individuals developed comparably robust SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies and variable levels of cross-reactive antibodies to seasonal coronaviruses. However, the strength and frequency of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in naive individuals were lower than in previously infected individuals. After the first vaccine dose, one-third of previously infected individuals lacked neutralizing antibodies; this was improved to one-fifth after the second dose. In all individuals, neutralizing antibody responses against the Alpha and Delta variants were weaker than against the reference strain. Our findings support future tailored vaccination strategies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as mRNA-vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are highly variable among individuals.

Abstract: Summary
The induction of synaptic plasticity at an individual dendritic glutamatergic spine can affect neighboring spines. This local modulation generates dendritic plasticity microdomains believed to expand the neuronal computational capacity. Here, we investigate whether local modulation of plasticity can also occur between glutamatergic synapses and adjacent GABAergic synapses. We find that the induction of long-term potentiation at an individual glutamatergic spine causes the depression of nearby GABAergic inhibitory synapses (within 3 μm), whereas more distant ones are potentiated. Notably, L-type calcium channels and calpain are required for this plasticity spreading. Overall, our data support a model whereby input-specific glutamatergic postsynaptic potentiation induces a spatially regulated rearrangement of inhibitory synaptic strength in the surrounding area through short-range heterosynaptic interactions. Such local coordination of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity is expected to influence dendritic information processing and integration.

Abstract: Summary
Concerted alteration of immune and metabolic homeostasis underlies several inflammation-related pathologies, ranging from metabolic syndrome to infectious diseases. Here, we explored the coordination of nucleic acid-dependent inflammatory responses and metabolic homeostasis. We reveal that the STING (stimulator of interferon genes) protein regulates metabolic homeostasis through inhibition of the fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) rate-limiting enzyme in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) desaturation. STING ablation and agonist-mediated degradation increased FADS2-associated desaturase activity and led to accumulation of PUFA derivatives that drive thermogenesis. STING agonists directly activated FADS2-dependent desaturation, promoting metabolic alterations. PUFAs in turn inhibited STING, thereby regulating antiviral responses and contributing to resolving STING-associated inflammation. Thus, we have unveiled a negative regulatory feedback loop between STING and FADS2 that fine-tunes inflammatory responses. Our results highlight the role of metabolic alterations in human pathologies associated with aberrant STING activation and STING-targeting therapies.

Abstract: Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) are considered valuable for regenerative therapy. Although glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is known to play a critical role in cell differentiation, its mechanism of the odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs remains unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the effect and underlying mechanisms of GLUT1 on odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs. hDPSCs was treated with phloretin (Phl), a GLUT1 inhibitor. The impact of GLUT1 on the odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs was analysed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, alizarin-red staining, and western blotting. Glucose uptake by hDPSCs was significantly inhibited by Phl treatment. Overall, inhibition of GLUT1 upregulated the expression of DSPP, DMP1, RUNX2, and OCN and increased the formation of mineralised nodules on odontogenic induction of hDPSCs. The levels of phosphorylated mTOR and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K) were increased after GLUT1 inhibition and decreased by an mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin, Rapa) during the odontogenic induction of hDPSCs. Moreover, mTOR suppression decreased the expression of the genes described above and formation of mineralised nodules. These results suggest that inhibition of GLUT1 promoted the odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs via the mTORC1–p70S6K axis, providing a foundation for further application of hDPSCs in regenerative therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Although overwhelming plasma membrane integrity loss leads to cell lysis and necrosis, cells can tolerate a limited level of plasma membrane damage, undergo ESCRT-III-mediated repair, and survive. Here, we find that cells which undergo limited plasma membrane damage from the pore-forming actions of MLKL, GSDMD, perforin, or detergents experience local activation of PKCs through Ca2+ influx at the damage sites. S660-phosphorylated PKCs subsequently activate the TAK1/IKKs axis and RelA/Cux1 complex to trigger chemokine expressions. We observe that in late-stage cancers, cells with active MLKL show expression of CXCL8. Similar expression induction is also found in ischemia-injured kidneys. Chemokines generated in this manner are also indispensable for recruiting immune cells to the dead and dying cells. This plasma membrane integrity-sensing pathway is similar to the well-established yeast cell wall integrity signaling pathway at molecular level, and this suggests an evolutionary conserved mechanism to respond to the cellular barrier damage.

Abstract: Summary
Gait and posture are often perturbed in many neurological, neuromuscular, and neuropsychiatric conditions. Rodents provide a tractable model for elucidating disease mechanisms and interventions. Here, we develop a neural-network-based assay that adopts the commonly used open field apparatus for mouse gait and posture analysis. We quantitate both with high precision across 62 strains of mice. We characterize four mutants with known gait deficits and demonstrate that multiple autism spectrum disorder (ASD) models show gait and posture deficits, implying this is a general feature of ASD. Mouse gait and posture measures are highly heritable and fall into three distinct classes. We conduct a genome-wide association study to define the genetic architecture of stride-level mouse movement in the open field. We provide a method for gait and posture extraction from the open field and one of the largest laboratory mouse gait and posture data resources for the research community.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular gene expression changes throughout a dynamic biological process, such as differentiation. Pseudotimes estimate cells’ progress along a dynamic process based on their individual gene expression states. Ordering the expression data by pseudotime provides information about the underlying regulator-gene interactions. Because the pseudotime distribution is not uniform, many standard mathematical methods are inapplicable for analyzing the ordered gene expression states. Here we present single-cell inference of networks using Granger ensembles (SINGE), an algorithm for gene regulatory network inference from ordered single-cell gene expression data. SINGE uses kernel-based Granger causality regression to smooth irregular pseudotimes and missing expression values. It aggregates predictions from an ensemble of regression analyses to compile a ranked list of candidate interactions between transcriptional regulators and target genes. In two mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation datasets, SINGE outperforms other contemporary algorithms. However, a more detailed examination reveals caveats about poor performance for individual regulators and uninformative pseudotimes.

Abstract: Summary
Cells are complex systems in which many functions are performed by different genetically defined and encoded functional modules. To systematically understand how these modules respond to drug or genetic perturbations, we develop a functional module states framework. Using this framework, we (1) define the drug-induced transcriptional state space for breast cancer cell lines using large public gene expression datasets and reveal that the transcriptional states are associated with drug concentration and drug targets, (2) identify potential targetable vulnerabilities through integrative analysis of transcriptional states after drug treatment and gene knockdown-associated cancer dependency, and (3) use functional module states to predict transcriptional state-dependent drug sensitivity and build prediction models for drug response. This approach demonstrates a similar prediction performance as approaches using high-dimensional gene expression values, with the added advantage of more clearly revealing biologically relevant transcriptional states and key regulators.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-angiogenic therapies, such as anti-VEGF antibodies (AVAs), have shown promise in clinical settings. However, adaptive resistance to such therapies occurs frequently. We use orthotopic ovarian cancer models with AVA-adaptive resistance to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Genomic profiling of AVA-resistant tumors guides us to endothelial p130cas. We find that bevacizumab induces cleavage of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells by caspase-10 and that VEGFR2 fragments internalize into the nucleus and autophagosomes. Nuclear VEGFR2 and p130cas fragments, together with TNKS1BP1 (tankyrase-1-binding protein), initiate endothelial cell death. Blockade of autophagy in AVA-resistant endothelial cells retains VEGFR2 at the membrane with bevacizumab treatment. Targeting host p130cas with RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-tagged nanoparticles or genomic ablation of vascular p130cas in p130casflox/floxTie2Cre mice significantly extends the survival of mice with AVA-resistant ovarian tumors. Higher vascular p130cas is associated with shorter survival of individuals with ovarian cancer. Our findings identify opportunities for new strategies to overcome adaptive resistance to AVA therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical processing depends on finely tuned excitatory and inhibitory connections in neuronal microcircuits. Reduced inhibition by somatostatin-expressing interneurons is a key component of altered inhibition associated with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (depression), which is implicated in cognitive deficits and rumination, but the link remains to be better established mechanistically in humans. Here we test the effect of reduced somatostatin interneuron-mediated inhibition on cortical processing in human neuronal microcircuits using a data-driven computational approach. We integrate human cellular, circuit, and gene expression data to generate detailed models of human cortical microcircuits in health and depression. We simulate microcircuit baseline and response activity and find a reduced signal-to-noise ratio and increased false/failed detection of stimuli due to a higher baseline activity in depression. We thus apply models of human cortical microcircuits to demonstrate mechanistically how reduced inhibition impairs cortical processing in depression, providing quantitative links between altered inhibition and cognitive deficits.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin misfolding has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis; yet, its role in therapy resistance remains unclear. Here, we systematically integrated sequencing and imaging data to examine the spatial and linear chromatin structures in targeted therapy-sensitive and -resistant human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We found widespread alterations in successive layers of chromatin organization including spatial compartments, contact domain boundaries, and enhancer positioning upon the emergence of targeted therapy resistance. The reorganization of genome folding structures closely coincides with the restructuring of chromatin activity and redistribution of architectural proteins. Mechanistically, the derepression and repositioning of the B-lineage-determining transcription factor EBF1 from the heterochromatic nuclear envelope to the euchromatic interior instructs widespread genome refolding and promotes therapy resistance in leukemic T cells. Together, our findings suggest that lineage-determining transcription factors can instruct changes in genome topology as a driving force for epigenetic adaptations in targeted therapy resistance.

Abstract: 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is being used in the treatment of several malignancies, but side effects are often reported and include: diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, poor appetite, watery eyes, and photophobia. We have developed and tested the cytotoxic activity of nanocrystalline powder of γ-alumina (γ-Al2O3) containing 5-FU in two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) CRC cell culture. γ-Al2O3 was prepared using a facile sol–gel method. The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles were investigated by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Energy Dispersive X–ray Analysis (EDXA). Moreover, the particle size was monitored by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We used MTT and a scratch assay to assess the antiproliferative and anti-migratory of this agent. The effect of γ-Al2O3-5-FU on SOD, MDA, and total-thiols levels were evaluated. We assessed the expression of apoptotic markers in mRNA or proteins by RT-PCR and ELISA respectively. γ-Al2O3-5-FU inhibited cell growth in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cell culture and increased apoptosis as detected by DAPI stainning via modulation of caspases, BAx, BCl2 and cyclinD1. γ-Al2O3-5-FU also reduced the migratory activity of CRC cells relative to untreated controls. γ-Al2O3-5-FU increased the level of MDA, while reducing the level of SOD and total-thiols as well as inflamatory markers (e.g., TNF-s and IL-6). Our study demonstrated that γ-Al2O3-5-FU inhibited cell growth and migration, indicating its potential value in the treatment of colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Summary
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates the balance between cellular anabolism and catabolism dependent on energy resources to maintain proliferation and survival. Small-compound AMPK activators show anti-cancer activity in preclinical models. Using the direct AMPK activator GSK621, we show that the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated by AMPK in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Mechanistically, the UPR effector protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) represses oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and pyrimidine biosynthesis and primes the mitochondrial membrane to apoptotic signals in an AMPK-dependent manner. Accordingly, in vitro and in vivo studies reveal synergy between the direct AMPK activator GSK621 and the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Thus, selective AMPK-activating compounds kill AML cells by rewiring mitochondrial metabolism that primes mitochondria to apoptosis by BH3 mimetics, holding therapeutic promise in AML.

Abstract: Summary
DNA accessibility of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) dictates transcriptional activity and drives cell differentiation during development. While many genes regulating embryonic development have been identified, the underlying CRE dynamics controlling their expression remain largely uncharacterized. To address this, we produced a multimodal resource and genomic regulatory map for the zebrafish community, which integrates single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq) with bulk histone PTMs and Hi-C data to achieve a genome-wide classification of the regulatory architecture determining transcriptional activity in the 24-h post-fertilization (hpf) embryo. We characterized the genome-wide chromatin architecture at bulk and single-cell resolution, applying sci-ATAC-seq on whole 24-hpf stage zebrafish embryos, generating accessibility profiles for ∼23,000 single nuclei. We developed a genome segmentation method, ScregSeg (single-cell regulatory landscape segmentation), for defining regulatory programs, and candidate CREs, specific to one or more cell types. We integrated the ScregSeg output with bulk measurements for histone post-translational modifications and 3D genome organization and identified new regulatory principles between chromatin modalities prevalent during zebrafish development. Sci-ATAC-seq profiling of npas4l/cloche mutant embryos identified novel cellular roles for this hematovascular transcriptional master regulator and suggests an intricate mechanism regulating its expression. Our work defines regulatory architecture and principles in the zebrafish embryo and establishes a resource of cell-type-specific genome-wide regulatory annotations and candidate CREs, providing a valuable open resource for genomics, developmental, molecular, and computational biology.

Abstract: Summary
Standard cancer therapy targets tumor cells without considering possible damage on the tumor microenvironment that could impair therapy response. In rectal cancer patients we find that inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAFs) are associated with poor chemoradiotherapy response. Employing a murine rectal cancer model or patient-derived tumor organoids and primary stroma cells, we show that, upon irradiation, interleukin-1α (IL-1α) not only polarizes cancer-associated fibroblasts toward the inflammatory phenotype but also triggers oxidative DNA damage, thereby predisposing iCAFs to p53-mediated therapy-induced senescence, which in turn results in chemoradiotherapy resistance and disease progression. Consistently, IL-1 inhibition, prevention of iCAFs senescence, or senolytic therapy sensitizes mice to irradiation, while lower IL-1 receptor antagonist serum levels in rectal patients correlate with poor prognosis. Collectively, we unravel a critical role for iCAFs in rectal cancer therapy resistance and identify IL-1 signaling as an attractive target for stroma-repolarization and prevention of cancer-associated fibroblasts senescence.

Abstract: Summary
The two human pathogens Helicobacter pylori and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) co-exist in many geographical areas of the world. Here, using a co-infection model of H. pylori and the Mtb relative M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), we show that both bacteria affect the colonization and immune control of the respective other pathogen. Co-occurring M. bovis boosts gastric Th1 responses and H. pylori control and aggravates gastric immunopathology. H. pylori in the stomach compromises immune control of M. bovis in the liver and spleen. Prior antibiotic H. pylori eradication or M. bovis-specific immunization reverses the effects of H. pylori. Mechanistically, the mutual effects can be attributed to the redirection of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) to sites of M. bovis infection. Reversal of Treg cell redirection by CXCR3 blockade restores M. bovis control. In conclusion, the simultaneous presence of both pathogens exacerbates the problems associated with each individual infection alone and should possibly be factored into treatment decisions.

Abstract: Summary
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely expressed in eukaryotes and are regulated in many biological processes. Although several studies indicate their activity as microRNA (miRNA) and protein sponges, little is known about their ability to directly control mRNA homeostasis. We show that the widely expressed circZNF609 directly interacts with several mRNAs and increases their stability and/or translation by favoring the recruitment of the RNA-binding protein ELAVL1. Particularly, the interaction with CKAP5 mRNA, which interestingly overlaps the back-splicing junction, enhances CKAP5 translation, regulating microtubule function in cancer cells and sustaining cell-cycle progression. Finally, we show that circZNF609 downregulation increases the sensitivity of several cancer cell lines to different microtubule-targeting chemotherapeutic drugs and that locked nucleic acid (LNA) protectors against the pairing region on circZNF609 phenocopy such effects. These data set an example of how the small effects tuned by circZNF609/CKAP5 mRNA interaction might have a potent output in tumor growth and drug response.

Abstract: Since the discovery of the pyridine nucleotide metabolites Ca2+ mobilizing messengers cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), they have been demonstrated to function as Ca2+ signaling messengers in a wide range of cell types. In this review, I will briefly summarize the roles of cADPR and NAADP in the physiological process of stimulus-secretion coupling in pancreatic β cells. I am also going to outline the current breadth of knowledge regarding intracellular Ca2+ stores and Ca2+ channels targeted by cADPR and NAADP, as well as the biogenesis of these Ca2+ signaling messengers. I focused on receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling in mediating the effects of GLP-1 and insulin in pancreatic β cells. A better grasp in the roles of these signaling messengers will assist in our understanding of Ca2+ signaling as well as pathophysiology.

Abstract: Small- and intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium (KCa2.x and KCa3.1, also called SK and IK) channels are activated exclusively by a Ca2+-calmodulin gating mechanism. Wild-type KCa2.3 channels have a Ca2+ EC50 value of ∼0.3 μM, while the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of wild-type KCa3.1 channels is ∼0.27 μM. Heterozygous genetic mutations of KCa2.3 channels have been associated with Zimmermann-Laband syndrome and idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension, while KCa3.1 channel mutations were reported in hereditary xerocytosis patients. KCa2.3_S436C and KCa2.3_V450L channels with mutations in the S45A/S45B helices exhibited hypersensitivity to Ca2+. The corresponding mutations in KCa3.1 channels also elevated the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity. KCa3.1_S314P, KCa3.1_A322V and KCa3.1_R352H channels with mutations in the HA/HB helices are hypersensitive to Ca2+, whereas KCa2.3 channels with the equivalent mutations are not. The different effects of the equivalent mutations in the HA/HB helices on the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 channels may imply distinct modulation of the two channel subtypes by the HA/HB helices. AP14145 reduced the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the hypersensitive mutant KCa2.3 channels, suggesting the potential therapeutic usefulness of negative gating modulators.

Abstract: Summary
Exosomes/small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) can serve as multifactorial mediators of cell-to-cell communication through their miRNA and protein cargo. Quantitative proteomic analysis of five cell lines representing metabolically important tissues reveals that each cell type has a unique sEV proteome. While classical sEV markers such as CD9/CD63/CD81 vary markedly in abundance, we identify six sEV markers (ENO1, GPI, HSPA5, YWHAB, CSF1R, and CNTN1) that are similarly abundant in sEVs of all cell types. In addition, each cell type has specific sEV markers. Using fat-specific Dicer-knockout mice with decreased white adipose tissue and increased brown adipose tissue, we show that these cell-type-specific markers can predict the changing origin of the serum sEVs. These results provide a valuable resource for understanding the sEV proteome of the cells and tissues important in metabolic homeostasis, identify unique sEV markers, and demonstrate how these markers can help in predicting the tissue of origin of serum sEVs.

Abstract: Summary
The subthreshold voltage-gated transient K+ current (IA) carried by pore-forming Kv4.2 subunits regulates the propagation of synaptic input, dendritic excitability, and synaptic plasticity in CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites of the hippocampus. We report that the Ca2+ channel subunit Cav2.3 regulates IA in this cell type. We initially identified Cav2.3 as a Kv4.2-interacting protein in a proteomic screen and we confirmed Cav2.3-Kv4.2 complex association using multiple techniques. Functionally, Cav2.3 Ca2+-entry increases Kv4.2-mediated whole-cell current due to an increase in Kv4.2 surface expression. Using pharmacology and Cav2.3 knockout mice, we show that Cav2.3 regulates the dendritic gradient of IA. Furthermore, the loss of Cav2.3 function leads to the enhancement of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents and NMDA receptor-mediated spine Ca2+ influx. These results propose that Cav2.3 and Kv4.2 are integral constituents of an ion channel complex that affects synaptic function in the hippocampus.

Abstract: This study aimed to address the roles of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MIR155HG in melanoma cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as the roles of deregulated MIR155HG in melanoma cells in regulation M1/M2 macrophage balance and macrophage infiltration. In this study, melanoma A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells that transfected with MIR155HG knockdown or overexpression plasmid were subjected to examinations of cell viability, colony formation ability, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Then, monocytic THP-1 cells were differentiated and polarized into M1 and M2 phenotypes. M1 and M2 markers were identified and MIR155HG levels in M0, M1 and M2 macrophages were determined. Next, conditioned medium (CM) from A375 cells knocking down or overexpressing MIR155HG was harvested to stimulate M0 macrophages. M1/M2 markers and macrophage infiltration were analyzed. The results showed that MIR155HG knockdown markedly reduced cell viability, suppressed colony formation, arrested the cell cycle at G1 phase and promoted apoptosis of A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells. Next, we successfully obtained and identified M1/M2 macrophages. Interestingly, M1 macrophages expressed lower, while M2 macrophages expressed higher levels of MIR155HG. More importantly, we also found that CM from A375 cells knocking down MIR155HG favored M1 polarization and ameliorated macrophage infiltration, while CM from MIR155HG overexpressing cells promoted M2 polarization and accelerated macrophage infiltration. These evidences suggest that MIR155HG knockdown may inhibit melanoma cell proliferation, aberrant MIR155HG levels correlate with the regulation of M1/M2 macrophage balance and macrophage infiltration in tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) efficiently leave the circulation to target cancer cells or contribute to inflammation is of high medical interest. Here, we demonstrate that human central memory CTLs cross the endothelium in a predominantly paracellular fashion, whereas effector and effector memory CTLs cross the endothelium preferably in a transcellular fashion. We find that effector CTLs show a round morphology upon adhesion and induce a synapse-like interaction with the endothelium where ICAM-1 is distributed at the periphery. Moreover, the interaction of ICAM-1:β2integrin and endothelial-derived CX3CL1:CX3CR1 enables transcellular migration. Mechanistically, we find that ICAM-1 clustering recruits the SNARE-family protein SNAP23, as well as syntaxin-3 and -4, for the local release of endothelial-derived chemokines like CXCL1/8/10. In line, silencing of endothelial SNAP23 drives CTLs across the endothelium in a paracellular fashion. In conclusion, our data suggest that CTLs trigger local chemokine release from the endothelium through ICAM-1-driven signals driving transcellular migration.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the homeostatic mechanism of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells is a critical issue in iNKT cell biology. Because interleukin (IL)-15 is required for the thymic generation of iNKT cells, IL-15 has also been considered necessary for the homeostasis of peripheral iNKT cells. Here, we delineated the in vivo cytokine requirement for iNKT cells, and we came to the surprising conclusion that IL-7, not IL-15, is the homeostatic cytokine for iNKT cells. Employing a series of experimental mouse models where the availability of IL-7 or IL-15 was manipulated in peripheral tissues, either by genetic tools or by adult thymectomy and cytokine pump installation, we demonstrate that the abundance of IL-7, and not IL-15, limits the size of the peripheral iNKT cell pool. These results redefine the cytokine requirement for iNKT cells and indicate competition for IL-7 between iNKT and conventional αβ T cells.

Abstract: Purpose
Emodin has a protective effect on asthma. Obesity is closely related to asthma. We further explored the role of Emodin in obese asthmatic rats.
Methods
Ovalbumin (OVA) was used to induce asthma model, and high fat diet (HFD) was used to induce obese rat model. Body weight was measured before and after the modeling. Serum lipid levels were evaluated using commercial kits. Then, lung tissue and airway tissue of rat were separated forin vivo. Hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) analyzed the extent of lung lesions. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR assessed the mRNA expression of Visfatin and Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay measured NF-κB protein expression in airway tissues. MTT, Brdu and Western blot detected cell viability, proliferation and NF-κB level of human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE, respectively.
Results
Asthma and Emodin alone had no effect on the body weight of normal rats, while HFD promoted the body weight of rats and could be reversed by Emodin. Both asthma and obesity promoted the pathological damage of rat lungs, including emphysema, lipid accumulation, edema changes, lymphoid hypertrophy and airway smooth muscle hyperplasia as well as lipid accumulation in surum, and Emodin treatment could reduce the damage. In the airway tissues of asthma and obesity models, up-regulated Visfatin mRNA and NF-κB protein were observed. In 16HBE, Emodin reversed Visfatin’s role in promoting cell viability, proliferation and activating NF-κB signaling pathway.
Conclusion
Emodin inhibited NF-κB expression to relieve the pathological symptoms of obese asthmatic rats by Visfatin.

Abstract: Summary
Candida albicans is a commensal of the urogenital tract and the predominant cause of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). Factors that increase circulatory estrogen levels such as pregnancy, the use of oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapy predispose women to VVC, but the reasons for this are largely unknown. Here, we investigate how adaptation of C. albicans to estrogen impacts the fungal host-pathogen interaction. Estrogen promotes fungal virulence by enabling C. albicans to avoid the actions of the innate immune system. Estrogen-induced innate immune evasion is mediated via inhibition of opsonophagocytosis through enhanced acquisition of the human complement regulatory protein, Factor H, on the fungal cell surface. Estrogen-induced accumulation of Factor H is dependent on the fungal cell surface protein Gpd2. The discovery of this hormone-sensing pathway might pave the way in explaining gender biases associated with fungal infections and may provide an alternative approach to improving women's health.

Abstract: Summary
Pitx3ak mice lack a functioning retina and develop fewer than 10% of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Del Río-Martín et al. (2019) reported that entrainment of circadian rhythms to daily light-dark (LD) cycles is absent in these mice, and that rhythms of locomotor activity, energy expenditure, and other metabolic variables are disrupted with food available ad libitum and fail to entrain to a daily feeding. The authors propose that retinal innervation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is required for development of cyclic metabolic homeostasis, but methodological issues limit interpretation of the results. Using standardized feeding schedules and procedures for distinguishing free-running from entrained circadian rhythms, we confirm that behavioral and metabolic rhythms in Pitx3ak mice do not entrain to LD cycles, but we find no impairment in circadian organization of metabolism with food available ad libitum and no impairment in entrainment of metabolic or behavioral rhythms by daily feeding schedules. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Del Río-Martín et al. (2019), published in Cell Reports. See also the response by Fernandez-Perez et al. (2022), published in this issue.

Gut microbiome is of major interest due to its close relationship to health and disease. Bacteria usually vary in gene content, leading to functional variations within species, so resolution higher than species-level methods is needed for ecological and clinical relevance. We design a protocol to identify strains in selected species with high discrimination and in high numbers by amplicon sequencing of the flagellin gene. We apply the protocol to fecal samples from a human diet trial, targeting Escherichia coli. Across the 119 samples from 16 individuals, there are 1,532 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), but only 32 ASVs are dominant in one or more fecal samples, despite frequent dominant strain turnover. Major strains in an intestine are found to be commonly accompanied by a large number of satellite cells, and many are identified as potential extraintestinal pathogens. The protocol could be used to track epidemics or investigate the intra- or inter-host diversity of pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
The epigenome delineates lineage-specific transcriptional programs and restricts cell plasticity to prevent non-physiological cell fate transitions. Although cell diversification fosters tumor evolution and therapy resistance, upstream mechanisms that regulate the stability and plasticity of the cancer epigenome remain elusive. Here we show that 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) not only suppresses DNA repair but also mediates the high-plasticity chromatin landscape. A combination of single-cell epigenomics and multi-omics approaches demonstrates that 2HG disarranges otherwise well-preserved stable nucleosome positioning and promotes cell-to-cell variability. 2HG induces loss of motif accessibility to the luminal-defining transcriptional factors FOXA1, FOXP1, and GATA3 and a shift from luminal to basal-like gene expression. Breast tumors with high 2HG exhibit enhanced heterogeneity with undifferentiated epigenomic signatures linked to adverse prognosis. Further, ascorbate-2-phosphate (A2P) eradicates heterogeneity and impairs growth of high 2HG-producing breast cancer cells. These findings suggest 2HG as a key determinant of cancer plasticity and provide a rational strategy to counteract tumor cell evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Mesendodermal specification is one of the earliest events in embryogenesis, where cells first acquire distinct identities. Cell differentiation is a highly regulated process that involves the function of numerous transcription factors (TFs) and signaling molecules, which can be described with gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Cell differentiation GRNs are difficult to build because existing mechanistic methods are low throughput, and high-throughput methods tend to be non-mechanistic. Additionally, integrating highly dimensional data composed of more than two data types is challenging. Here, we use linked self-organizing maps to combine chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)/ATAC-seq with temporal, spatial, and perturbation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from Xenopus tropicalis mesendoderm development to build a high-resolution genome scale mechanistic GRN. We recover both known and previously unsuspected TF-DNA/TF-TF interactions validated through reporter assays. Our analysis provides insights into transcriptional regulation of early cell fate decisions and provides a general approach to building GRNs using highly dimensional multi-omic datasets.

Abstract: Summary
The crAss-like phages are a diverse group of related viruses that includes some of the most abundant viruses of the human gut. To explore their diversity and functional role in human population and clinical cohorts, we analyze gut metagenomic data collected from 1,950 individuals from the Netherlands. We identify 1,556 crAss-like phage genomes, including 125 species-level and 32 genus-level clusters absent from the reference databases used. Analysis of their genomic features shows that closely related crAss-like phages can possess strikingly divergent regions responsible for transcription, presumably acquired through recombination. Prediction of crAss-like phage hosts points primarily to bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes, consistent with previous reports. Finally, we explore the temporal stability of crAss-like phages over a 4-year period and identify associations between the abundance of crAss-like phages and several human phenotypes, including depletion of crAss-like phages in inflammatory bowel disease patients.

Abstract: Summary
The superkiller (SKI) complex is the cytoplasmic co-factor and regulator of the RNA-degrading exosome. In human cells, the SKI complex functions mainly in co-translational surveillance-decay pathways, and its malfunction is linked to a severe congenital disorder, the trichohepatoenteric syndrome. To obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating the human SKI (hSKI) complex, we structurally characterized several of its functional states in the context of 80S ribosomes and substrate RNA. In a prehydrolytic ATP form, the hSKI complex exhibits a closed conformation with an inherent gating system that effectively traps the 80S-bound RNA into the hSKI2 helicase subunit. When active, hSKI switches to an open conformation in which the gating is released and the RNA 3′ end exits the helicase. The emerging picture is that the gatekeeping mechanism and architectural remodeling of hSKI underpin a regulated RNA channeling system that is mechanistically conserved among the cytoplasmic and nuclear helicase-exosome complexes.

Abstract: Summary
The coordinated regulation of growth control and metabolic pathways is required to meet the energetic and biosynthetic demands associated with proliferation. Emerging evidence suggests that the Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) reprograms cellular metabolism to meet the anabolic demands of growth, although the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that YAP co-opts the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-dependent lipogenic program to facilitate proliferation and tissue growth. Mechanistically, YAP stimulates de novo lipogenesis via mechanistic target of rapamcyin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and subsequent activation of SREBP. Importantly, YAP-dependent regulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is required to activate mTORC1/SREBP and stimulate de novo lipogenesis. We also find that the SREBP target genes fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) are conditionally required to support YAP-dependent proliferation and tissue growth. These studies reveal that de novo lipogenesis is a metabolic vulnerability that can be targeted to disrupt YAP-dependent proliferation and tissue growth.

Abstract: Summary
HER2+ breast cancer patients are presented with either synchronous (S-BM), latent (Lat), or metachronous (M-BM) brain metastases. However, the basis for disparate metastatic fitness among disseminated tumor cells of similar oncotype within a distal organ remains unknown. Here, employing brain metastatic models, we show that metabolic diversity and plasticity within brain-tropic cells determine metastatic fitness. Lactate secreted by aggressive metastatic cells or lactate supplementation to mice bearing Lat cells limits innate immunosurveillance and triggers overt metastasis. Attenuating lactate metabolism in S-BM impedes metastasis, while M-BM adapt and survive as residual disease. In contrast to S-BM, Lat and M-BM survive in equilibrium with innate immunosurveillance, oxidize glutamine, and maintain cellular redox homeostasis through the anionic amino acid transporter xCT. Moreover, xCT expression is significantly higher in matched M-BM brain metastatic samples compared to primary tumors from HER2+ breast cancer patients. Inhibiting xCT function attenuates residual disease and recurrence in these preclinical models.

Abstract: Two-pore channels are ancient members of the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily that are expressed predominantly on acidic organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes. Here we review recent advances in understanding how TPCs are activated by their ligands and identify five salient features: (1) TPCs are Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channels gated by NAADP. (2) NAADP activation is indirect through associated NAADP receptors. (3) TPCs are also Na+-selective channels gated by PI(3,5)P2. (4) PI(3,5)P2 activation is direct through a structurally-resolved binding site. (5) TPCs switch their ion selectivity in an agonist-dependent manner.

Abstract: Apart from the treatment potential of micro-fragmented adipose tissue (MF) in joint diseases, what’s less clear is the mechanism of MF on Osteoarthritis (OA). Synoviocytes isolated from synovium tissues of 11 knee joint OA patients were identified and co-cultured with MF collected by Lipogems®. Cytokines and mRNA levels in synoviocytes were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell viability, apoptosis and apoptosis-related protein expression of Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α)-activated synoviocytes were detected by cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry and western blot, respectively. The rescue experiments were conducted to verify the causal relationship of MF and miR-92a-3p. The relationship between miR-92a-3p and KLHL29 was verified by bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blot. OA synoviocytes were composed of synovial fibroblasts and synovial macrophages. After co-cultivation of synoviocytes and TNF-α, the levels of Interleukin (IL)-8 and hyaluronic acid (HA) appeared a few changes, and those of chemotactic cytokine ligand (CCL) 2, CCL3, CCL5 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 were downregulated, while the levels of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, IL-10 and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were up-regulated. Co-culture of MF and activated synoviocytes reversed the above-mentioned effects regulated by TNF-α and reduced the mRNA levels of inflammatory factors. However, miR-92a-3p inhibitor overturned the reversal. KLHL29 was the target gene of miR-92a-3p and its expression was suppressed in activated synoviocytes co-cultured with MF, which was reversed by down-regulated miR-92a-3p. Collectively, MF regulated the biological functions of OA synoviocytes by upregulating miR-92a-3p expression.

Abstract: Summary
Aneuploidy, defective differentiation, and inactivation of the tumor suppressor TP53 all occur frequently during tumorigenesis. Here, we probe the potential links among these cancer traits by inactivating TP53 in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). TP53−/− hESCs exhibit increased proliferation rates, mitotic errors, and low-grade structural aneuploidy; produce poorly differentiated immature teratomas in mice; and fail to differentiate into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro. Genome-wide CRISPR screen reveals requirements of ciliogenesis and sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathways for hESC differentiation into NPCs. TP53 deletion causes abnormal ciliogenesis in neural rosettes. In addition to restraining cell proliferation through CDKN1A, TP53 activates the transcription of BBS9, which encodes a ciliogenesis regulator required for proper Shh signaling and NPC formation. This developmentally regulated transcriptional program of TP53 promotes ciliogenesis, restrains Shh signaling, and commits hESCs to neural lineages.

Abstract: Certain circulating cell subsets are involved in immune dysregulation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and tuberculosis (TB) co-infection; however, the characteristics and role of these subclusters are unknown. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with HIV-1 infection alone (HIV-pre) and those with HIV-1-TB co-infection without anti-TB treatment (HIV-pre & TB-pre) and with anti-TB treatment for 2 weeks (HIV-pre & TB-pos) were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptome of different immune cell subclusters. We obtained > 60,000 cells and identified 32 cell subclusters based on gene expression. The proportion of immune-cell subclusters was altered in HIV-1-TB co-infected individuals compared with that in HIV-pre-group, indicating immune dysregulation corresponding to different disease states. The proportion of an inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocyte subset was higher in the HIV-pre & TB-pre group than in the HIV-pre group; this was validated in an additional cohort (n = 80) via a blood cell differential test, which also demonstrated a good discriminative performance (area under the curve, 0.8046). These findings depicted the atlas of immune PBMC subclusters in HIV-1-TB co-infection and demonstrate that monocyte subsets in peripheral blood might serve as a discriminating biomarker for diagnosis of HIV-1-TB co-infection.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic cancer (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy for which the identification of novel therapies is urgently needed. Here, we establish a human PDAC organoid biobank from 31 genetically distinct lines, covering a representative range of tumor subtypes, and demonstrate that these reflect the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity of primary PDAC tissue. We use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and drug screening to characterize drug-gene interactions with ARID1A and BRCA2. We find that missense, but not frameshift, mutations in the PDAC driver gene ARID1A are associated with increased sensitivity to the kinase inhibitors dasatinib (p < 0.0001) and VE-821 (p < 0.0001). We further conduct an automated drug-repurposing screen with 1,172 FDA-approved compounds, identifying 26 compounds that effectively kill PDAC organoids, including 19 chemotherapy drugs currently approved for other cancer types. We validate the activity of these compounds in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo validated hits include emetine and ouabain, compounds that are approved for non-cancer indications and that perturb the ability of PDAC organoids to respond to hypoxia. Our study provides proof-of-concept for advancing precision oncology and for identifying candidates for drug repurposing via genome editing and drug screening in tumor organoid biobanks.

Abstract: Summary
Protein machines undergo conformational motions to interact with and manipulate polymeric substrates. The Sec translocase promiscuously recognizes, becomes activated, and secretes >500 non-folded preprotein clients across bacterial cytoplasmic membranes. Here, we reveal that the intrinsic dynamics of the translocase ATPase, SecA, and of preproteins combine to achieve translocation. SecA possesses an intrinsically dynamic preprotein clamp attached to an equally dynamic ATPase motor. Alternating motor conformations are finely controlled by the γ-phosphate of ATP, while ADP causes motor stalling, independently of clamp motions. Functional preproteins physically bridge these independent dynamics. Their signal peptides promote clamp closing; their mature domain overcomes the rate-limiting ADP release. While repeated ATP cycles shift the motor between unique states, multiple conformationally frustrated prongs in the clamp repeatedly “catch and release” trapped preprotein segments until translocation completion. This universal mechanism allows any preprotein to promiscuously recognize the translocase, usurp its intrinsic dynamics, and become secreted.

Abstract: Summary
TH2 cells and innate lymphoid cells 2 (ILC2) can stimulate tumor growth by secreting pro-tumorigenic cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13. However, the mechanisms by which type 2 immune cells traffic to the tumor microenvironment are unknown. Here, we show that oncogenic KrasG12D increases IL-33 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, which recruits and activates TH2 and ILC2 cells. Correspondingly, cancer-cell-specific deletion of IL-33 reduces TH2 and ILC2 recruitment and promotes tumor regression. Unexpectedly, IL-33 secretion is dependent on the intratumoral fungal mycobiome. Genetic deletion of IL-33 or anti-fungal treatment decreases TH2 and ILC2 infiltration and increases survival. Consistently, high IL-33 expression is observed in approximately 20% of human PDAC, and expression is mainly restricted to cancer cells. These data expand our knowledge of the mechanisms driving PDAC tumor progression and identify therapeutically targetable pathways involving intratumoral mycobiome-driven secretion of IL-33.

Abstract: To investigate the effects of the previous administration of testosterone propionate (TP) on the morphology of the gastrocnemius muscle of Wistar rats submitted to ladder-based resistance training (LRT). Twenty-eight rats were divided equally into groups: initial control (CI), 4-week TP (CT4), 4-week TP + LRT (TRT), and placebo + LRT (RT). The rats from the CT4 and TRT groups were treated with TP for four weeks (10 mg/kg/week). TRT and RT trained for ten weeks. The rodents were euthanized at the end of the experiment, and gastrocnemius muscle, prostate, and left and right testicles were collected. There was no statistical difference between the RT and TRT for final volume load. The prostate mass of the TRT and RT groups was statistically heavier than the CT4 group (P < 0.01). The TRT group's prostate/body mass ratio was statistically different from the CT4 group (P < 0.05). The TRT group was shown to have larger type I, type II, and mean fCSA fibers than all other groups (P < 0.001). Regarding the nuclei/fiber ratio (N/f), the CT4, RT, and TRT groups had higher values than CI (P < 0.01). In addition, the RT group showed a higher N/f ratio than CT4 (P < 0.001) but lower than TRT (P < 0.001). In conclusion, short-term TP administration before resistance training can elicit a greater N/f ratio and size of the mean fCSA of the Gastrocnemius muscle of young adult Wistar rats than resistance training alone.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic association studies for blood cell traits, which are key indicators of health and immune function, have identified several hundred associations and defined a complex polygenic architecture. Polygenic scores (PGSs) for blood cell traits have potential clinical utility in disease risk prediction and prevention, but designing PGS remains challenging and the optimal methods are unclear. To address this, we evaluated the relative performance of 6 methods to develop PGS for 26 blood cell traits, including a standard method of pruning and thresholding (P + T) and 5 learning methods: LDpred2, elastic net (EN), Bayesian ridge (BR), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN). We evaluated these optimized PGSs on blood cell trait data from UK Biobank and INTERVAL. We find that PGSs designed using common machine learning methods EN and BR show improved prediction of blood cell traits and consistently outperform other methods. Our analyses suggest EN/BR as the top choices for PGS construction, showing improved performance for 25 blood cell traits in the external validation, with correlations with the directly measured traits increasing by 10%–23%. Ten PGSs showed significant statistical interaction with sex, and sex-specific PGS stratification showed that all of them had substantial variation in the trajectories of blood cell traits with age. Genetic correlations between the PGSs for blood cell traits and common human diseases identified well-known as well as new associations. We develop machine learning-optimized PGS for blood cell traits, demonstrate their relationships with sex, age, and disease, and make these publicly available as a resource.

Abstract: Summary
Citrulline can be converted into argininosuccinate by argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) in the urea cycle and the citrulline-nitric oxide cycle. However, the regulation and biological function of citrulline metabolism remain obscure in the immune system. Unexpectedly, we found that macrophage citrulline declines rapidly after interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, which is required for efficient proinflammatory signaling activation. Mechanistically, IFN-γ and/or LPS stimulation promotes signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1)-mediated ASS1 transcription and Janus kinase2 (JAK2)-mediated phosphorylation of ASS1 at tyrosine 87, thereby leading to citrulline depletion. Reciprocally, increased citrulline directly binds to JAK2 and inhibits JAK2-STAT1 signaling. Blockage of ASS1-mediated citrulline depletion suppresses the host defense against bacterial infection in vivo. We therefore define a central role for ASS1 in controlling inflammatory macrophage activation and antibacterial defense through depletion of cellular citrulline and, further, identify citrulline as an innate immune-signaling metabolite that engages a metabolic checkpoint for proinflammatory responses.
