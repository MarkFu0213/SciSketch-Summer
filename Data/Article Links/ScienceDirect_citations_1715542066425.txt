Abstract: Summary
SF3b is a heptameric protein complex of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) that is essential for pre-mRNA splicing. Mutations in the largest SF3b subunit, SF3B1/SF3b155, are linked to cancer and lead to alternative branch site (BS) selection. Here we report the crystal structure of a human SF3b core complex, revealing how the distinctive conformation of SF3b155’s HEAT domain is maintained by multiple contacts with SF3b130, SF3b10, and SF3b14b. Protein-protein crosslinking enabled the localization of the BS-binding proteins p14 and U2AF65 within SF3b155’s HEAT-repeat superhelix, which together with SF3b14b forms a composite RNA-binding platform. SF3b155 residues, the mutation of which leads to cancer, contribute to the tertiary structure of the HEAT superhelix and its surface properties in the proximity of p14 and U2AF65. The molecular architecture of SF3b reveals the spatial organization of cancer-related SF3b155 mutations and advances our understanding of their effects on SF3b structure and function.

Abstract: Summary
PKMζ has been proposed to be essential for maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term memory (LTM). However, recent data from PKMζ-knockout mice has called this role into question. Instead, the other atypical isoform, protein kinase C iota/lambda (PKCι/λ), has emerged as a potential alternative player. Therefore, the nature of the “memory molecule” maintaining learned information remains uncertain. Here, we report knockdown (KD) of PKCι/λ and PKMζ in the dorsal hippocampus and find deficits in early expression and late maintenance, respectively, during both LTP and hippocampus-dependent LTM. Sequential increases in the active form of PKCι/λ and PKMζ are detected during LTP or fear conditioning. Importantly, PKMζ, but not PKCι/λ, KD disrupts previously established LTM. Thus, PKCι/λ and PKMζ have distinct functions in LTP and memory, with PKMζ playing a specific role in memory maintenance. This relaying pattern may represent a precise molecular mechanism by which atypical PKCs regulate the different stages of memory.

The TIP60 Complex Regulates Bivalent Chromatin Recognition by 53BP1 through Direct H4K20me Binding and H2AK15 Acetylation,

Abstract: Summary
The NuA4/TIP60 acetyltransferase complex is a key regulator of genome expression and stability. Here we identified MBTD1 as a stable subunit of the complex, and we reveal that, via a histone reader domain for H4K20me1/2, MBTD1 allows TIP60 to associate with specific gene promoters and to promote the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination. It was previously suggested that TIP60-dependent acetylation of H4 regulates binding of the non-homologous end joining factor 53BP1, which engages chromatin through simultaneous binding of H4K20me2 and H2AK15ub. We find that the TIP60 complex regulates association of 53BP1 partly by competing for H4K20me2 and by regulating H2AK15ub. Ubiquitylation of H2AK15 by RNF168 inhibits chromatin acetylation by TIP60, while this residue can be acetylated by TIP60 in vivo, blocking its ubiquitylation. Altogether, these results uncover an intricate mechanism orchestrated by the TIP60 complex to regulate 53BP1-dependent repair through competitive bivalent binding and modification of chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) is a major determinant and indicator of cell fate, but it is not possible to assess small changes in Δψm within cells or in vivo. To overcome this, we developed an approach that utilizes two mitochondria-targeted probes each containing a triphenylphosphonium (TPP) lipophilic cation that drives their accumulation in response to Δψm and the plasma membrane potential (Δψp). One probe contains an azido moiety and the other a cyclooctyne, which react together in a concentration-dependent manner by “click” chemistry to form MitoClick. As the mitochondrial accumulation of both probes depends exponentially on Δψm and Δψp, the rate of MitoClick formation is exquisitely sensitive to small changes in these potentials. MitoClick accumulation can then be quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This approach enables assessment of subtle changes in membrane potentials within cells and in the mouse heart in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza virus polymerase transcribes or replicates the segmented RNA genome (vRNA) into respectively viral mRNA or full-length copies and initiates RNA synthesis by binding the conserved 3′ and 5′ vRNA ends (the promoter). In recent structures of promoter-bound polymerase, the cap-binding and endonuclease domains are configured for cap snatching, which generates capped transcription primers. Here, we present a FluB polymerase structure with a bound complementary cRNA 5′ end that exhibits a major rearrangement of the subdomains within the C-terminal two-thirds of PB2 (PB2-C). Notably, the PB2 nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing domain translocates ∼90 Å to bind to the endonuclease domain. FluA PB2-C alone and RNA-free FluC polymerase are similarly arranged. Biophysical and cap-dependent endonuclease assays show that in solution the polymerase explores different conformational distributions depending on which RNA is bound. The inherent flexibility of the polymerase allows it to adopt alternative conformations that are likely important during polymerase maturation into active progeny RNPs.

Abstract: Summary
Adult tissue-specific stem cells (SCs) mediate tissue homeostasis and regeneration and can give rise to all lineages in the corresponding tissue, similar to the early progenitors that generate organs in the first place. However, the developmental origins of adult SCs are largely unknown. We recently identified thymosphere-forming stem cells (TSFCs) in the adult mouse thymus, which display genuine stemness features and can generate the two major thymic epithelial cell lineages. Here, we show that embryonic TSFCs possess stemness features but differ from adult TSFCs in surface marker profile. Our findings support the model of a continuous thymic SC lineage that is maintained throughout ontogeny. TGF-β signaling differentially affects embryonic versus adult thymosphere formation, suggesting that thymic epithelial SC potency depends on both developmental stage and environmental signals. Collectively, our findings suggest that embryonic TSFCs contribute to an adult SC pool and that TSFC plasticity is controlled by TGF-β signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The Golgi apparatus controls the formation of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays important for Golgi organization, polarized transport, cell motility, and cell differentiation. Here, we show that CAMSAP2 stabilizes and attaches microtubule minus ends to the Golgi through a complex of AKAP450 and myomegalin. CLASPs stabilize CAMSAP2-decorated microtubules but are not required for their Golgi tethering. AKAP450 is also essential for Golgi microtubule nucleation, and myomegalin and CDK5RAP2 but not CAMSAP2 contribute to this function. In the absence of centrosomes, AKAP450- and CAMSAP2-dependent pathways of microtubule minus-end organization become dominant, and the presence of at least one of them is needed to maintain microtubule density. Strikingly, a compact Golgi can be assembled in the absence of both centrosomal and Golgi microtubules. However, CAMSAP2- and AKAP450-dependent Golgi microtubules facilitate Golgi reorientation and cell invasion in a 3D matrix. We propose that Golgi-anchored microtubules are important for polarized cell movement but not for coalescence of Golgi membranes.

Abstract: Summary
Selective autophagy performs an array of tasks to maintain intracellular homeostasis, sterility, and organellar and cellular functionality. The fidelity of these processes depends on precise target recognition and limited activation of the autophagy apparatus in a localized fashion. Here we describe cooperation in such processes between the TRIM family and Galectin family of proteins. TRIMs, which are E3 ubiquitin ligases, displayed propensity to associate with Galectins. One specific TRIM, TRIM16, interacted with Galectin-3 in a ULK1-dependent manner. TRIM16, through integration of Galectin- and ubiquitin-based processes, coordinated recognition of membrane damage with mobilization of the core autophagy regulators ATG16L1, ULK1, and Beclin 1 in response to damaged endomembranes. TRIM16 affected mTOR, interacted with TFEB, and influenced TFEB's nuclear translocation. The cooperation between TRIM16 and Galectin-3 in targeting and activation of selective autophagy protects cells from lysosomal damage and Mycobacterium tuberculosis invasion.

Abstract: Summary
More than 80% of patients with the refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have mutations in Splicing Factor 3B, Subunit 1 (SF3B1). We generated a conditional knockin mouse model of the most common SF3B1 mutation, Sf3b1K700E. Sf3b1K700E mice develop macrocytic anemia due to a terminal erythroid maturation defect, erythroid dysplasia, and long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) expansion. Sf3b1K700E myeloid progenitors and SF3B1-mutant MDS patient samples demonstrate aberrant 3′ splice-site selection associated with increased nonsense-mediated decay. Tet2 loss cooperates with Sf3b1K700E to cause a more severe erythroid and LT-HSC phenotype. Furthermore, the spliceosome modulator, E7017, selectively kills SF3B1K700E-expressing cells. Thus, SF3B1K700E expression reflects the phenotype of the mutation in MDS and may be a therapeutic target in MDS.

Abstract: Summary
Twelve sodium-activated potassium channel (KCNT1, Slack) genetic mutants have been identified from severe early-onset epilepsy patients. The changes in biophysical properties of these mutants and the underlying mechanisms causing disease remain elusive. Here, we report that seven of the 12 mutations increase, whereas one mutation decreases, the channel’s sodium sensitivity. Two of the mutants exhibit channel over-activity only when the intracellular Na+ ([Na+]i) concentration is ∼80 mM. In contrast, single-channel data reveal that all 12 mutants increase the maximal open probability (Po). We conclude that these mutant channels lead to channel over-activity predominantly by increasing the ability of sodium binding to activate the channel, which is indicated by its maximal Po. The sodium sensitivity of these epilepsy causing mutants probably determines the [Na+]i concentration at which these mutants exert their pathological effects.

Abstract: Summary
We describe a comprehensive genomic characterization of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Using this dataset, we expand the catalogue of known ACC driver genes to include PRKAR1A, RPL22, TERF2, CCNE1, and NF1. Genome wide DNA copy-number analysis revealed frequent occurrence of massive DNA loss followed by whole-genome doubling (WGD), which was associated with aggressive clinical course, suggesting WGD is a hallmark of disease progression. Corroborating this hypothesis were increased TERT expression, decreased telomere length, and activation of cell-cycle programs. Integrated subtype analysis identified three ACC subtypes with distinct clinical outcome and molecular alterations which could be captured by a 68-CpG probe DNA-methylation signature, proposing a strategy for clinical stratification of patients based on molecular markers.

Abstract: Summary
Despite their antiviral effect, the in vivo effect of interferons on HIV transmission is difficult to predict, because interferons also activate and recruit HIV-susceptible cells to sites of infection. HIV does not normally induce type I interferons in infected cells, but does if TREX1 is knocked down. Here, we investigated the effect of topical TREX1 knockdown and local interferon production on HIV transmission in human cervicovaginal explants and humanized mice. In explants in which TREX1 was knocked down, HIV induced interferons, which blocked infection. In humanized mice, even though TREX1 knockdown increased infiltrating immune cells, it delayed viral replication for 3–4 weeks. Similarly intravaginal application of type I interferons the day before HIV infection induced interferon responsive genes, reduced inflammation, and decreased viral replication. However, intravenous interferon enhanced inflammation and infection. Thus, in models of human sexual transmission, a localized interferon response inhibits HIV transmission but systemic interferons do not.

Abstract: The objective of this research was to evaluate the optimal passage number according to the biological characteristics of mouse skin melanocytes from different passages. Skin punch biopsies harvested from the dorsal region of 2-day old mice were used to establish melanocyte cultures. The cells from passage 4, 7, 10 and 13 were collected and evaluated for their melanogenic activity. Histochemical staining for tyrosinase (TYR) activity and immunostaining for the melanocyte specific markers including S-100 antigen, TYR, tyrosinase related protein 1 (TYRP1), tyrosinase related protein 2 (TYRP2) and micropthalmia associated transcription factor (MITF) confirmed purity and melanogenic capacity of melanocytes from different passages, with better melanogenic activity of passage 10 and 13 cells being observed. Treatment of passage 13 melanocytes with α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) showed increased expression of MITF, TYR and TYRP2 mRNA. However, considering the TYR mRNA dramatically high expression which is the characteristics of melanoma cells, melanocytes from passage 10 was the optimal passage number for the further research. Our results demonstrate culture of pure populations of mouse melanocytes to at least 10 passages and illustrate the potential utility of passage 10 cells for studies of intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of genes controlling pigmentation and coat color in mouse.

Abstract: Summary
Argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) is the rate-limiting enzyme for arginine biosynthesis. ASS1 expression is lost in a range of tumor types, including 50% of malignant pleural mesotheliomas. Starving ASS1-deficient cells of arginine with arginine blockers such as ADI-PEG20 can induce selective lethality and has shown great promise in the clinical setting. We have generated a model of ADI-PEG20 resistance in mesothelioma cells. This resistance is mediated through re-expression of ASS1 via demethylation of the ASS1 promoter. Through coordinated transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling, we have shown that ASS1-deficient cells have decreased levels of acetylated polyamine metabolites, together with a compensatory increase in the expression of polyamine biosynthetic enzymes. Upon arginine deprivation, polyamine metabolites are decreased in the ASS1-deficient cells and in plasma isolated from ASS1-deficient mesothelioma patients. We identify a synthetic lethal dependence between ASS1 deficiency and polyamine metabolism, which could potentially be exploited for the treatment of ASS1-negative cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Upon infection, antigen-specific naive CD8 T cells are activated and differentiate into short-lived effector cells (SLECs) and memory precursor cells (MPECs). The underlying signaling pathways remain largely unresolved. We show that Rictor, the core component of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), regulates SLEC and MPEC commitment. Rictor deficiency favors memory formation and increases IL-2 secretion capacity without dampening effector functions. Moreover, mTORC2-deficient memory T cells mount more potent recall responses. Enhanced memory formation in the absence of mTORC2 was associated with Eomes and Tcf-1 upregulation, repression of T-bet, enhanced mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity, and fatty acid oxidation. This transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming is mainly driven by nuclear stabilization of Foxo1. Silencing of Foxo1 reversed the increased MPEC differentiation and IL-2 production and led to an impaired recall response of Rictor KO memory T cells. Therefore, mTORC2 is a critical regulator of CD8 T cell differentiation and may be an important target for immunotherapy interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Inhalation of environmental antigens such as allergens does not always induce inflammation in the respiratory tract. While antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells and macrophages, take up inhaled antigens, the cell-intrinsic molecular mechanisms that prevent an inflammatory response during this process, such as activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, are not well understood. Here, we show that the nuclear receptor PPARγ plays a critical role in blocking NF-κB activation in response to inhaled antigens to preserve immune tolerance. Tolerance induction promoted mitochondrial respiration, generation of H2O2, and suppression of NF-κB activation in WT, but not PPARγ-deficient, APCs. Forced restoration of H2O2 in PPARγ-deficient cells suppressed IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation. Conversely, scavenging reactive oxygen species from mitochondria promoted IκBα degradation with loss of regulatory and promotion of inflammatory T cell responses in vivo. Thus, communication between PPARγ and the mitochondria maintains immune quiescence in the airways.

Abstract: Summary
V(D)J recombination relies on the presence of proximal enhancers that activate the antigen receptor (AgR) loci in a lineage- and stage-specific manner. Unexpectedly, we find that both active and inactive AgR enhancers cooperate to disseminate their effects in a localized and long-range manner. Here, we demonstrate the importance of short-range contacts between active enhancers that constitute an Igk super-enhancer in B cells. Deletion of one element reduces the interaction frequency between other enhancers in the hub, which compromises the transcriptional output of each component. Furthermore, we establish that, in T cells, long-range contact and cooperation between the inactive Igk enhancer MiEκ and the active Tcrb enhancer Eβ alters enrichment of CBFβ binding in a manner that impacts Tcrb recombination. These findings underline the complexities of enhancer regulation and point to a role for localized and long-range enhancer-sharing between active and inactive elements in lineage- and stage-specific control.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic interactions between RNA polymerase II and various mRNA-processing and chromatin-modifying enzymes are mediated by the changing phosphorylation pattern on the C-terminal domain (CTD) of polymerase subunit Rpb1 during different stages of transcription. Phosphorylations within the repetitive heptamer sequence (YSPTSPS) of CTD have primarily been defined using antibodies, but these do not distinguish different repeats or allow comparative quantitation. Using a CTD modified for mass spectrometry (msCTD), we show that Ser5-P and Ser2-P occur throughout the length of CTD and are far more abundant than other phosphorylation sites. msCTD extracted from cells mutated in several CTD kinases or phosphatases showed the expected changes in phosphorylation. Furthermore, msCTD associated with capping enzyme was enriched for Ser5-P while that bound to the transcription termination factor Rtt103 had higher levels of Ser2-P. These results suggest a relatively sparse and simple “CTD code.”

Abstract: Summary
The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) coordinates proper chromosome biorientation on the spindle with ubiquitination activities of CDC20-activated anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/CCDC20). APC/CCDC20 and two E2s, UBE2C and UBE2S, catalyze ubiquitination through distinct architectures for linking ubiquitin (UB) to substrates and elongating polyUB chains, respectively. MCC, which contains a second molecule of CDC20, blocks APC/CCDC20-UBE2C-dependent ubiquitination of Securin and Cyclins, while differentially determining or inhibiting CDC20 ubiquitination to regulate spindle surveillance, checkpoint activation, and checkpoint termination. Here electron microscopy reveals conformational variation of APC/CCDC20-MCC underlying this multifaceted regulation. MCC binds APC/C-bound CDC20 to inhibit substrate access. However, rotation about the CDC20-MCC assembly and conformational variability of APC/C modulate UBE2C-catalyzed ubiquitination of MCC’s CDC20 molecule. Access of UBE2C is limiting for subsequent polyubiquitination by UBE2S. We propose that conformational dynamics of APC/CCDC20-MCC modulate E2 activation and determine distinctive ubiquitination activities as part of a response mechanism ensuring accurate sister chromatid segregation.

Abstract: Summary
Commensal microbes are necessary for a healthy gut immune system. However, the mechanism involving these microbes that establish and maintain gut immune responses is largely unknown. Here, we have found that the gut immune receptor leucine-rich repeat (LRR) C19 is involved in host-microbiota interactions. LRRC19 deficiency not only impairs the gut immune system but also reduces inflammatory responses in gut tissues. We demonstrate that the LRRC19-associated chemokines CCL6, CCL9, CXCL9, and CXCL10 play a critical role in immune cell recruitment and intestinal inflammation. The expression of these chemokines is associated with regenerating islet-derived (REG) protein-mediated microbiotas. We also found that the expression of REGs may be regulated by gut Lactobacillus through LRRC19-mediated activation of NF-κB. Therefore, our study establishes a regulatory axis of LRRC19, REGs, altered microbiotas, and chemokines for the recruitment of immune cells and the regulation of intestinal inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Alterations in dendritic spine numbers are linked to deficits in learning and memory. While we previously revealed that postsynaptic plasticity-related gene 1 (PRG-1) controls lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling at glutamatergic synapses via presynaptic LPA receptors, we now show that PRG-1 also affects spine density and synaptic plasticity in a cell-autonomous fashion via protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)/β1-integrin activation. PRG-1 deficiency reduces spine numbers and β1-integrin activation, alters long-term potentiation (LTP), and impairs spatial memory. The intracellular PRG-1 C terminus interacts in an LPA-dependent fashion with PP2A, thus modulating its phosphatase activity at the postsynaptic density. This results in recruitment of adhesome components src, paxillin, and talin to lipid rafts and ultimately in activation of β1-integrins. Consistent with these findings, activation of PP2A with FTY720 rescues defects in spine density and LTP of PRG-1-deficient animals. These results disclose a mechanism by which bioactive lipid signaling via PRG-1 could affect synaptic plasticity and memory formation.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-editing technologies allow systematic inactivation of human genes. Whether knockout phenotypes always reflect gene functions as determined by acute RNAi is an important question. Here we show how the acute knockdown of the Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) gene DOCK6, coding for a RAC1/CDC42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, results in strikingly different phenotypes to those generated by genomic DOCK6 disruption. Cell-intrinsic adaptation compensates for loss of DOCK6 function. Prolonged DOCK6 loss impacts upon the MRTF-A/SRF transcription factor, reducing levels of the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15. Reduced ISGylation of the IQGAP1 protein increases levels of active CDC42 and RAC1 to compensate for DOCK6 disruption. Similar downregulation of ISG15 in cells from DOCK6 AOS patients indicates that such adaptation can compensate for genetic defects during development. Thus, phenotypes of gene inactivation are critically dependent on the timescale, as acute knockdown reflects a transient state of adjustment to a new equilibrium that is attained following compensation.

Abstract: Summary
Centrioles are fundamental and evolutionarily conserved microtubule-based organelles whose assembly is characterized by microtubule growth rates that are orders of magnitude slower than those of cytoplasmic microtubules. Several centriolar proteins can interact with tubulin or microtubules, but how they ensure the exceptionally slow growth of centriolar microtubules has remained mysterious. Here, we bring together crystallographic, biophysical, and reconstitution assays to demonstrate that the human centriolar protein CPAP (SAS-4 in worms and flies) binds and “caps” microtubule plus ends by associating with a site of β-tubulin engaged in longitudinal tubulin-tubulin interactions. Strikingly, we uncover that CPAP activity dampens microtubule growth and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting catastrophes and promoting rescues. We further establish that the capping function of CPAP is important to limit growth of centriolar microtubules in cells. Our results suggest that CPAP acts as a molecular lid that ensures slow assembly of centriolar microtubules and, thereby, contributes to organelle length control.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) regulates inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization, and disease-associated IRF5 genetic variants regulate pattern-recognition-receptor (PRR)-induced cytokines. PRR-stimulated macrophages and M1 macrophages exhibit enhanced glycolysis, a central mediator of inflammation. We find that IRF5 is needed for PRR-enhanced glycolysis in human macrophages and in mice in vivo. Upon stimulation of the PRR nucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) in human macrophages, IRF5 binds RIP2, IRAK1, and TRAF6. IRF5, in turn, is required for optimal Akt2 activation, which increases expression of glycolytic pathway genes and HIF1A as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines and M1 polarization. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines and glycolytic pathways co-regulate each other. Rs2004640/rs2280714 TT/TT IRF5 disease-risk-carrier cells demonstrate increased IRF5 expression and increased PRR-induced Akt2 activation, glycolysis, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and M1 polarization relative to GG/CC carrier macrophages. Our findings identify that IRF5 disease-associated polymorphisms regulate diverse immunological and metabolic outcomes and provide further insight into mechanisms contributing to the increasingly recognized important role for glycolysis in inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
While interphase mitochondria associate with microtubules, mitotic mitochondria dissociate from spindle microtubules and localize in the cell periphery. Here, we show that this redistribution is not mediated by mitochondrial active transport or tethering to the cytoskeleton. Instead, kinesin and dynein, which link mitochondria to microtubules, are shed from the mitochondrial surface. Shedding is driven by phosphorylation of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic targets by CDK1 and Aurora A. Forced recruitment of motor proteins to mitotic mitochondria to override this shedding prevents their proper symmetrical distribution and disrupts the balanced inheritance of mitochondria to daughter cells. Moreover, when mitochondria with bound dynein bind to the mitotic spindle, they arrest cell-cycle progression and produce binucleate cells. Thus, our results show that the regulated release of motor proteins from the mitochondrial surface is a critical mitotic event.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) for protein degradation has been under intensive study, and yet, we have only partial understanding of mechanisms by which proteins are selected to be targeted for proteolysis. One of the obstacles in studying these recognition pathways is the limited repertoire of known degradation signals (degrons). To better understand what determines the susceptibility of intracellular proteins to degradation by the UPS, we developed an unbiased method for large-scale identification of eukaryotic degrons. Using a reporter-based high-throughput competition assay, followed by deep sequencing, we measured a degradation potency index for thousands of native polypeptides in a single experiment. We further used this method to identify protein quality control (PQC)-specific and compartment-specific degrons. Our method provides an unprecedented insight into the yeast degronome, and it can readily be modified to study protein degradation signals and pathways in other organisms and in various settings.

Abstract: The morphological characteristics and glycoconjugate composition of the vomeronasal organ (VNO) of the horse was investigated using histological, immunohistochemical, and lectin histochemical methods. The VNO is bilaterally located at the base of the nasal septum, has a tubular structure surrounded by cartilage, and consists of sensory and non-sensory epithelia. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the vomeronasal sensory epithelium (VSE) consisted of receptor cells positive for both olfactory marker protein (OMP) and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), supporting cells, and basal cells. VNO receptor cells were positive for G protein Gαi2 (vomeronasal receptor type 1 marker), but not Gαo (vomeronasal receptor type 2 marker). Lectin histochemical studies using 21 biotinylated lectins showed that the free border of the VSE was positive for 20 lectins. The receptor and supporting cells reacted with 16 lectins while the basal cells reacted with 15 lectins, with varying intensities. In the vomeronasal non-sensory epithelium, the free border was positive for 19 lectins. The cilated cells were positive for 17 lectins and the basal cells were positive for 15 lectins. The vomeronasal glands, positioned in the lamina propria, were stained with both periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and alcian blue (pH 2.5). Eighteen lectins stained the acinar cells of the vomeronasal glands with various binding patterns. These findings suggest that horse VNO receptor cells express vomeronasal receptor type 1, and the VNO glands have mucous to seromucous characteristics. Moreover, each lectin differentially binds each cell type in both the VNO sensory and non-sensory epithelia.

Abstract: Various stimuli to the exposed surface of dentin induce changes in the hydrodynamic force inside the dentinal tubules resulting in dentinal pain. Recent evidences indicate that mechano-sensor channels, such as the transient receptor potential channels, in odontoblasts receive these hydrodynamic forces and trigger the release of ATP to the pulpal neurons, to generate dentinal pain. A recent study, however, has shown that odontoblasts also express glutamate receptors (GluRs). This implies that cells in the dental pulp tissue have the ability to release glutamate, which acts as a functional intercellular mediator to establish inter-odontoblast and odontoblast-trigeminal ganglion (TG) neuron signal communication. To investigate the intercellular signal communication, we applied mechanical stimulation to odontoblasts and measured the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). During mechanical stimulation in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, we observed a transient [Ca2+]i increase not only in single stimulated odontoblasts, but also in adjacent odontoblasts. We could not observe these responses in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. [Ca2+]i increases in the neighboring odontoblasts during mechanical stimulation of single odontoblasts were inhibited by antagonists of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) as well as glutamate-permeable anion channels. In the odontoblast-TG neuron coculture, we observed an increase in [Ca2+]i in the stimulated odontoblasts and TG neurons, in response to direct mechanical stimulation of single odontoblasts. These [Ca2+]i increases in the neighboring TG neurons were inhibited by antagonists for mGluRs. The [Ca2+]i increases in the stimulated odontoblasts were also inhibited by mGluRs antagonists. We further confirmed that the odontoblasts express group I, II, and III mGluRs. However, we could not record any currents evoked from odontoblasts near the mechanically stimulated odontoblast, with or without extracellular Mg2+, indicating that N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor does not contribute to inter-odontoblast signal communication. The results suggest that a mechanically stimulated odontoblast is capable of releasing glutamate into the extracellular space via glutamate-permeable anion channels. The released glutamate activates mGluRs on the odontoblasts in an autocrine/paracrine manner, forming an inter-odontoblasts communication, which drives dentin formation via odontoblast-odontoblast signal communication. Glutamate and mGluRs also mediate neurotransmission between the odontoblasts and neurons in the dental pulp to modulate sensory signal transmission for dentinal sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are key regulators of gene expression and physiology. Nearly half of all human NRs lack endogenous ligands including estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα). ERRα has important roles in cancer, metabolism, and skeletal homeostasis. Affinity chromatography of tissue lipidomes with the ERRα ligand-binding domain (LBD) and subsequent transcriptional assays identified cholesterol as an endogenous ERRα agonist. Perturbation of cholesterol biosynthesis or inhibition of ERRα revealed the interdependence of cholesterol and ERRα. In bone, the effects of cholesterol, statin, and bisphosphonate on osteoclastogenesis require ERRα; and consequently, cholesterol-induced bone loss or bisphosphonate osteoprotection is lost in ERRα knockout mice. Furthermore, statin induction of muscle toxicity and cholesterol suppression of macrophage cytokine secretion are impaired by loss or inhibition of ERRα. These findings reveal a key step in ERRα regulation and explain the actions of two highly prescribed drugs, statins and bisphosphonates.

Abstract: Summary
ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTD1–16) have emerged as major downstream effectors of NAD+ signaling in the cell. Most ARTDs (ARTD7 and 8, 10–12, and 14–17) catalyze the transfer of a single unit of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to target proteins, a process known as mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation). Progress in understanding the cellular functions of MARylation has been limited by the inability to identify the direct targets for individual mono-ARTDs. Here, we engineered mono-ARTDs to use an NAD+ analog that is orthogonal to wild-type ARTDs. We profiled the MARylomes of ARTD10 and ARTD11 in vitro, identifying isoform-specific targets and revealing a potential role for ARTD11 in nuclear pore complex biology. We found that ARTD11 targeting is dependent on both its regulatory and catalytic domains, which has important implications for how ARTDs recognize their targets. We anticipate that our chemical genetic strategy will be generalizable to all mono-ARTD family members based on the similarity of the mono-ARTD catalytic domains.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous signals drive the proliferative expansion of the distal endoderm and the underlying mesenchyme during lung branching morphogenesis, but little is known about how these signals are integrated. Here, we show by analysis of conditional double mutants that the two T-box transcription factor genes Tbx2 and Tbx3 act together in the lung mesenchyme to maintain branching morphogenesis. Expression of both genes depends on epithelially derived Shh signaling, with additional modulation by Bmp, Wnt, and Tgfβ signaling. Genetic rescue experiments reveal that Tbx2 and Tbx3 function downstream of Shh to maintain pro-proliferative mesenchymal Wnt signaling, in part by direct repression of the Wnt antagonists Frzb and Shisa3. In combination with our previous finding that Tbx2 and Tbx3 repress the cell-cycle inhibitors Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b, we conclude that Tbx2 and Tbx3 maintain proliferation of the lung mesenchyme by way of at least two molecular mechanisms: regulating cell-cycle regulation and integrating the activity of multiple signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Crosstalk between cellular metabolism and the epigenome regulates epigenetic and metabolic homeostasis and normal cell behavior. Changes in cancer cell metabolism can directly impact epigenetic regulation and promote transformation. Here we analyzed the contribution of methionine and serine metabolism to methylation of DNA and RNA. Serine can contribute to this pathway by providing one-carbon units to regenerate methionine from homocysteine. While we observed this contribution under methionine-depleted conditions, unexpectedly, we found that serine supported the methionine cycle in the presence and absence of methionine through de novo ATP synthesis. Serine starvation increased the methionine/S-adenosyl methionine ratio, decreasing the transfer of methyl groups to DNA and RNA. While serine starvation dramatically decreased ATP levels, this was accompanied by lower AMP and did not activate AMPK. This work highlights the difference between ATP turnover and new ATP synthesis and defines a vital function of nucleotide synthesis beyond making nucleic acids.

Components of the evolutionarily conserved developmental planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway were recently described to play a prominent role in cancer cell dissemination. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PCP molecules drive the spread of cancer cells remain largely unknown. PRICKLE1 encodes a PCP protein bound to the promigratory serine/threonine kinase MINK1. We identify RICTOR, a member of the mTORC2 complex, as a PRICKLE1-binding partner and show that the integrity of the PRICKLE1-MINK1-RICTOR complex is required for activation of AKT, regulation of focal adhesions, and cancer cell migration. Disruption of the PRICKLE1-RICTOR interaction results in a strong impairment of breast cancer cell dissemination in xenograft assays. Finally, we show that upregulation of PRICKLE1 in basal breast cancers, a subtype characterized by high metastatic potential, is associated with poor metastasis-free survival.

Abstract: Summary
CENP-A is a centromere-specific histone 3 variant essential for centromere specification. CENP-A partially replaces canonical histone H3 at the centromeres. How the particular CENP-A/H3 ratio at centromeres is precisely maintained is unknown. It also remains unclear how CENP-A is excluded from non-centromeric chromatin. Here, we identify Ccp1, an uncharacterized NAP family protein in fission yeast that antagonizes CENP-A loading at both centromeric and non-centromeric regions. Like the CENP-A loading factor HJURP, Ccp1 interacts with CENP-A and is recruited to centromeres at the end of mitosis in a Mis16-dependent manner. These data indicate that factors with opposing CENP-A loading activities are recruited to centromeres. Furthermore, Ccp1 also cooperates with H2A.Z to evict CENP-A assembled in euchromatin. Structural analyses indicate that Ccp1 forms a homodimer that is required for its anti-CENP-A loading activity. Our study establishes mechanisms for maintenance of CENP-A homeostasis at centromeres and the prevention of ectopic assembly of centromeres.

Abstract: Summary
P2X receptors are trimeric ATP-gated cation channels involved in physiological processes ranging widely from neurotransmission to pain and taste signal transduction. The modulation of the channel gating, including that by divalent cations, contributes to these diverse physiological functions of P2X receptors. Here, we report the crystal structure of an invertebrate P2X receptor from the Gulf Coast tick Amblyomma maculatum in the presence of ATP and Zn2+ ion, together with electrophysiological and computational analyses. The structure revealed two distinct metal binding sites, M1 and M2, in the extracellular region. The M1 site, located at the trimer interface, is responsible for Zn2+ potentiation by facilitating the structural change of the extracellular domain for pore opening. In contrast, the M2 site, coupled with the ATP binding site, might contribute to regulation by Mg2+. Overall, our work provides structural insights into the divalent cation modulations of P2X receptors.

Abstract: Summary
The organelles within a eukaryotic host are manipulated by viruses to support successful virus replication and spread of infection, yet the global impact of viral infection on host organelles is poorly understood. Integrating microscopy, subcellular fractionation, mass spectrometry, and functional analyses, we conducted a cell-wide study of organelles in primary fibroblasts throughout the time course of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. We used label-free and isobaric-labeling proteomics to characterize nearly 4,000 host and 100 viral proteins, then classified their specific subcellular locations over time using machine learning. We observed a global reorganization of proteins across the secretory pathway, plasma membrane, and mitochondria, including reorganization and processing of lysosomal proteins into distinct subpopulations and translocations of individual proteins between organelles at specific time points. We also demonstrate that MYO18A, an unconventional myosin that translocates from the plasma membrane to the viral assembly complex, is necessary for efficient HCMV replication. This study provides a comprehensive resource for understanding host and virus biology during HCMV pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) maintains metabolic equilibrium to survive during infection and upon exposure to antimycobacterial drugs are poorly characterized. Ergothioneine (EGT) and mycothiol (MSH) are the major redox buffers present in Mtb, but the contribution of EGT to Mtb redox homeostasis and virulence remains unknown. We report that Mtb WhiB3, a 4Fe-4S redox sensor protein, regulates EGT production and maintains bioenergetic homeostasis. We show that central carbon metabolism and lipid precursors regulate EGT production and that EGT modulates drug sensitivity. Notably, EGT and MSH are both essential for redox and bioenergetic homeostasis. Transcriptomic analyses of EGT and MSH mutants indicate overlapping but distinct functions of EGT and MSH. Last, we show that EGT is critical for Mtb survival in both macrophages and mice. This study has uncovered a dynamic balance between Mtb redox and bioenergetic homeostasis, which critically influences Mtb drug susceptibility and pathogenicity.

Abstract: Summary
Sorely missing from the “toolkit” for directed differentiation of stem/progenitor cells are agonists of the BMP-signaling pathway. Using a high-throughput chemical screen, we discovered that PD407824, a checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor, increases the sensitivity of cells to sub-threshold amounts of BMP4. We show utility of the compound in the directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells toward mesoderm or cytotrophoblast stem cells. Blocking CHK1 activity using pharmacological compounds or CHK1 knockout using single guide RNA (sgRNA) confirmed that CHK1 inhibition increases the sensitivity to BMP4 treatment. Additional mechanistic studies indicate that CHK1 inhibition depletes p21 levels, thereby activating CDK8/9, which then phosphorylates the SMAD2/3 linker region, leading to decreased levels of SMAD2/3 protein and enhanced levels of nuclear SMAD1. This study provides insight into mechanisms controlling the BMP/transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways and a useful pharmacological reagent for directed differentiation of stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a classic example of inflammation-linked cancer. To characterize the role of the immune system in hepatic injury and tumor development, we comparatively studied the extent of liver disease and hepatocarcinogenesis in immunocompromised versus immunocompetent Fah-deficient mice. Strikingly, chronic liver injury and tumor development were markedly suppressed in alymphoid Fah−/− mice despite an overall increased mortality. Mechanistically, we show that CD8+ T cells and lymphotoxin β are central mediators of HCC formation. Antibody-mediated depletion of CD8+ T cells as well as pharmacological inhibition of the lymphotoxin-β receptor markedly delays tumor development in mice with chronic liver injury. Thus, our study unveils distinct functions of the immune system, which are required for liver regeneration, survival, and hepatocarcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPRer) pathway plays an important role in helping pancreatic β cells to adapt their cellular responses to environmental cues and metabolic stress. Although altered UPRer gene expression appears in rodent and human type 2 diabetic (T2D) islets, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. We show here that germline and β cell-specific disruption of the lysine acetyltransferase 2B (Kat2b) gene in mice leads to impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance. Genome-wide analysis of Kat2b-regulated genes and functional assays reveal a critical role for Kat2b in maintaining UPRer gene expression and subsequent β cell function. Importantly, Kat2b expression is decreased in mouse and human diabetic β cells and correlates with UPRer gene expression in normal human islets. In conclusion, Kat2b is a crucial transcriptional regulator for adaptive β cell function during metabolic stress by controlling UPRer and represents a promising target for T2D prevention and treatment.

Abstract: Summary
IL-12 is important for the differentiation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, as well as Th1 cells in humans. Still, how IL-12 signals regulate Tfh versus Th1 cell differentiation remains poorly characterized. Here we aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms that regulate the differentiation and the function of IL-12-stimulated human naive CD4+ T cells. We found that T-bet promoted the expression of CXCR5 in human CD4+ T cells. We provide evidence that T-bet does not strongly inhibit the Tfh cell differentiation program per se but diminishes the functions to provide help to B cells. This study also suggests that IRF4 plays an important role in driving the early differentiation of IL-12-stimulated CD4+ T cells toward Tfh and away from Th1 by inhibiting the expression of Eomesodermin. Thus, the fate of IL-12-stimulated CD4+ T cells is determined through interplay of multiple transcription factors at early stages.

Abstract: Summary
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and related alphaviruses cause epidemics of acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the failure of immune clearance of CHIKV, we studied mice infected with an attenuated CHIKV strain (181/25) and the pathogenic parental strain (AF15561), which differ by five amino acids. Whereas AF15561 infection of wild-type mice results in viral persistence in joint tissues, 181/25 is cleared. In contrast, 181/25 infection of μMT mice lacking mature B cells results in viral persistence in joint tissues, suggesting that virus-specific antibody is required for clearance of infection. Mapping studies demonstrated that a highly conserved glycine at position 82 in the A domain of the E2 glycoprotein impedes clearance and neutralization of multiple CHIKV strains. Remarkably, murine and human antibodies targeting E2 domain B failed to neutralize pathogenic CHIKV strains efficiently. Our data suggest that pathogenic CHIKV strains evade E2 domain-B-neutralizing antibodies to establish persistence.

Olig2-Dependent Reciprocal Shift in PDGF and EGF Receptor Signaling Regulates Tumor Phenotype and Mitotic Growth in Malignant Glioma,

Abstract: Summary
Malignant gliomas exhibit extensive heterogeneity and poor prognosis. Here we identify mitotic Olig2-expressing cells as tumor-propagating cells in proneural gliomas, elimination of which blocks tumor initiation and progression. Intriguingly, deletion of Olig2 resulted in tumors that grow, albeit at a decelerated rate. Genome occupancy and expression profiling analyses reveal that Olig2 directly activates cell-proliferation machinery to promote tumorigenesis. Olig2 deletion causes a tumor phenotypic shift from an oligodendrocyte precursor-correlated proneural toward an astroglia-associated gene expression pattern, manifest in downregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α and reciprocal upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Olig2 deletion further sensitizes glioma cells to EGFR inhibitors and extends the lifespan of animals. Thus, Olig2-orchestrated receptor signaling drives mitotic growth and regulates glioma phenotypic plasticity. Targeting Olig2 may circumvent resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs.

Regulation of Poly(A) Tail and Translation during the Somatic Cell Cycle,

Abstract: Summary
Poly(A) tails are critical for mRNA stability and translation. However, recent studies have challenged this view, showing that poly(A) tail length and translation efficiency are decoupled in non-embryonic cells. Using TAIL-seq and ribosome profiling, we investigate poly(A) tail dynamics and translational control in the somatic cell cycle. We find dramatic changes in poly(A) tail lengths of cell-cycle regulatory genes like CDK1, TOP2A, and FBXO5, explaining their translational repression in M phase. We also find that poly(A) tail length is coupled to translation when the poly(A) tail is <20 nucleotides. However, as most genes have >20 nucleotide poly(A) tails, their translation is regulated mainly via poly(A) tail length-independent mechanisms during the cell cycle. Specifically, we find that terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) tract-containing transcripts escape global translational suppression in M phase and are actively translated. Our quantitative and comprehensive data provide a revised view of translational control in the somatic cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Acetylation of histones and transcription-related factors is known to exert epigenetic and transcriptional control of gene expression. Here we report that histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) also regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by controlling poly(A) RNA stability. Inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 induces massive and widespread degradation of normally stable poly(A) RNA in mammalian and Drosophila cells. Acetylation-induced RNA decay depends on the HATs p300 and CBP, which acetylate the exoribonuclease CAF1a, a catalytic subunit of the CCR4-CAF1-NOT deadenlyase complex and thereby contribute to accelerating poly(A) RNA degradation. Taking adipocyte differentiation as a model, we observe global stabilization of poly(A) RNA during differentiation, concomitant with loss of CBP/p300 expression. Our study uncovers reversible acetylation as a fundamental switch by which HATs and HDACs control the overall turnover of poly(A) RNA.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets are vital to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection as the putative sites of virion assembly, but morphogenesis and egress of virions remain ill defined. We performed quantitative lipid droplet proteome analysis of HCV-infected cells to identify co-factors of that process. Our results demonstrate that HCV disconnects lipid droplets from their metabolic function. Annexin A3 (ANXA3), a protein enriched in lipid droplet fractions, strongly impacted HCV replication and was characterized further: ANXA3 is recruited to lipid-rich fractions in HCV-infected cells by the viral core and NS5A proteins. ANXA3 knockdown does not affect HCV RNA replication but severely impairs virion production with lower specific infectivity and higher density of secreted virions. ANXA3 is essential for the interaction of viral envelope E2 with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and for trafficking, but not lipidation, of ApoE in HCV-infected cells. Thus, we identified ANXA3 as a regulator of HCV maturation and egress.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is the first known endocrine signal activated by protein restriction. Although FGF21 is robustly elevated in low-protein environments, increased FGF21 is also seen in various other contexts such as fasting, overfeeding, ketogenic diets, and high-carbohydrate diets, leaving its nutritional context and physiological role unresolved and controversial. Here, we use the Geometric Framework, a nutritional modeling platform, to help reconcile these apparently conflicting findings in mice confined to one of 25 diets that varied in protein, carbohydrate, and fat content. We show that FGF21 was elevated under low protein intakes and maximally when low protein was coupled with high carbohydrate intakes. Our results explain how elevation of FGF21 occurs both under starvation and hyperphagia, and show that the metabolic outcomes associated with elevated FGF21 depend on the nutritional context, differing according to whether the animal is in a state of under- or overfeeding.

Abstract: Summary
Meiosis is a differentiated program of the cell cycle that is characterized by high levels of recombination followed by two nuclear divisions. In fission yeast, the genetic program during meiosis is regulated at multiple levels, including transcription, mRNA stabilization, and splicing. Mei4 is a forkhead transcription factor that controls the expression of mid-meiotic genes. Here, we describe that Fkh2, another forkhead transcription factor that is essential for mitotic cell-cycle progression, also plays a pivotal role in the control of meiosis. Fkh2 binding preexists in most Mei4-dependent genes, inhibiting their expression. During meiosis, Fkh2 is phosphorylated in a CDK/Cig2-dependent manner, decreasing its affinity for DNA, which creates a window of opportunity for Mei4 binding to its target genes. We propose that Fkh2 serves as a placeholder until the later appearance of Mei4 with a higher affinity for DNA that induces the expression of a subset of meiotic genes.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrent mutations in the splicing factor U2AF35 are found in several cancers and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). How oncogenic U2AF35 mutants promote transformation remains to be determined. Here we derive cell lines transformed by the oncogenic U2AF35(S34F) mutant and identify aberrantly processed pre-mRNAs by deep sequencing. We find that in U2AF35(S34F)-transformed cells the autophagy-related factor 7 (Atg7) pre-mRNA is abnormally processed, which unexpectedly is not due to altered splicing but rather selection of a distal cleavage and polyadenylation (CP) site. This longer Atg7 mRNA is translated inefficiently, leading to decreased ATG7 levels and an autophagy defect that predisposes cells to secondary mutations, resulting in transformation. MDS and acute myeloid leukemia patient samples harboring U2AF35(S34F) have a similar increased use of the ATG7 distal CP site, and previous studies have shown that mice with hematopoietic cells lacking Atg7 develop an MDS-like syndrome. Collectively, our results reveal a basis for U2AF35(S34F) oncogenic activity.

Abstract: Summary
Primary cilia are ubiquitous sensory organelles that mediate diverse signaling pathways. Cilia position on the cell surface is determined by the location of the basal body (BB) that templates the cilium. The mechanisms that regulate BB positioning in the context of ciliogenesis are largely unknown. Here we show that the conserved signaling and scaffolding protein Girdin localizes to the proximal regions of centrioles and regulates BB positioning and ciliogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans sensory neurons and human RPE-1 cells. Girdin depletion alters localization of the intercentriolar linker and ciliary rootlet component rootletin, and rootletin knockdown in RPE-1 cells mimics Girdin-dependent phenotypes. C. elegans Girdin also regulates localization of the apical junction component AJM-1, suggesting that in nematodes Girdin may position BBs via rootletin- and AJM-1-dependent anchoring to the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane, respectively. Together, our results describe a conserved role for Girdin in BB positioning and ciliogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue macrophages exhibit diverse functions, ranging from the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, including clearance of senescent erythrocytes and cell debris, to modulation of inflammation and immunity. Their contribution to the control of blood-stage malaria remains unclear. Here, we show that in the absence of tissue-resident CD169+ macrophages, Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection results in significantly increased parasite sequestration, leading to vascular occlusion and leakage and augmented tissue deposition of the malarial pigment hemozoin. This leads to widespread tissue damage culminating in multiple organ inflammation. Thus, the capacity of CD169+ macrophages to contain the parasite burden and its sequestration into different tissues and to limit infection-induced inflammation is crucial to mitigating Plasmodium infection and pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Neutralization or deletion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) causes loss of control of intracellular pathogens in mice and humans, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we found that TNF antagonized alternative activation of macrophages and dendritic cells by IL-4. TNF inhibited IL-4-induced arginase 1 (Arg1) expression by decreasing histone acetylation, without affecting STAT6 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. In Leishmania major-infected C57BL/6 wild-type mice, type 2 nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS2) was detected in inflammatory dendritic cells or macrophages, some of which co-expressed Arg1. In TNF-deficient mice, Arg1 was hyperexpressed, causing an impaired production of NO in situ. A similar phenotype was seen in L. major-infected BALB/c mice. Arg1 deletion in hematopoietic cells protected these mice from an otherwise lethal disease, although their disease-mediating T cell response (Th2, Treg) was maintained. Thus, deletion or TNF-mediated restriction of Arg1 unleashes the production of NO by NOS2, which is critical for pathogen control.

Abstract: Summary
The master regulatory transcription factor GATA-2 triggers hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell generation. GATA2 haploinsufficiency is implicated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and GATA2 overexpression portends a poor prognosis for AML. However, the constituents of the GATA-2-dependent genetic network mediating pathogenesis are unknown. We described a p38-dependent mechanism that phosphorylates GATA-2 and increases GATA-2 target gene activation. We demonstrate that this mechanism establishes a growth-promoting chemokine/cytokine circuit in AML cells. p38/ERK-dependent GATA-2 phosphorylation facilitated positive autoregulation of GATA2 transcription and expression of target genes, including IL1B and CXCL2. IL-1β and CXCL2 enhanced GATA-2 phosphorylation, which increased GATA-2-mediated transcriptional activation. p38/ERK-GATA-2 stimulated AML cell proliferation via CXCL2 induction. As GATA2 mRNA correlated with IL1B and CXCL2 mRNAs in AML-M5 and high expression of these genes predicted poor prognosis of cytogenetically normal AML, we propose that the circuit is functionally important in specific AML contexts.

Abstract: Summary
The Linc-p21 locus, encoding a long non-coding RNA, plays an important role in p53 signaling, cell-cycle regulation, and tumor suppression. However, despite extensive study, confusion exists regarding its mechanism of action: is activity driven by the transcript acting in trans, in cis, or by an underlying functional enhancer? Here, using a knockout mouse model and a massively parallel enhancer assay, we delineate the functional elements at this locus. We observe that, even in tissues with no detectable Linc-p21 transcript, deletion of the locus significantly affects local gene expression, including of the cell-cycle regulator Cdkn1a. To characterize this RNA-independent regulatory effect, we systematically interrogated the underlying DNA sequence for enhancer activity at nucleotide resolution and confirmed the existence of multiple enhancer elements. Together, these data suggest that, in vivo, the cis-regulatory effects mediated by Linc-p21, in the presence or absence of transcription, are due to DNA enhancer elements.

Abstract: Summary
The EZH2 histone methyltransferase mediates the humoral immune response and drives lymphomagenesis through formation of bivalent chromatin domains at critical germinal center (GC) B cell promoters. Herein we show that the actions of EZH2 in driving GC formation and lymphoma precursor lesions require site-specific binding by the BCL6 transcriptional repressor and the presence of a non-canonical PRC1-BCOR-CBX8 complex. The chromodomain protein CBX8 is induced in GC B cells, binds to H3K27me3 at bivalent promoters, and is required for stable association of the complex and the resulting histone modifications. Moreover, oncogenic BCL6 and EZH2 cooperate to accelerate diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) development and combinatorial targeting of these repressors results in enhanced anti-lymphoma activity in DLBCLs.

Abstract: Mammalian P2X receptors (P2XRs), a family of seven ionotropic purinergic receptors, function as ion channels modulating diverse cellular processes such as secretion, apoptosis and proliferation in response to extracellular ATP. Previously, it was shown that upon ATP stimulus, the P2X7 receptor (a member of P2XR family) triggers plasma membrane (PM) blebbing in HEK293 cells. In this study, we demonstrate that this phenomenon extends to another member of the P2XR family–P2X2 receptor (P2X2R). Similar to P2X7 receptor, P2X2R blebbing is dependent on Ca2+–calmodulin and ROCK-I. To elucidate the spatiotemporal relationship between Ca2+ signaling and blebbing, protein biosensors and switches were used to image and generate Ca2+ signals, respectively, while observing PM blebbing in cells. Blebbing cannot be initiated by Ca2+ influx from the endoplasmic reticulum or by Ca2+ transport across the PM by other Ca2+ channels. To trigger blebbing, it is necessary for Ca2+ to enter specifically through the P2X2R. Lastly, a local Ca2+ signal near a fragment that encodes the intracellular P2X2R C-terminus tail is sufficient to trigger blebbing.
Keywords: P2X2Rs; Plasma membrane blebbing; Ca2+ signaling

Abstract: Summary
Deciphering the sub-compartmental location of a given protein of interest may help explain its physiological function, but it can be challenging to do using optical or biochemical methods. Imaging with electron microscopy (EM) can provide highly resolved mapping of proteins; however, EM requires complex sample preparation and a specialized facility. Here, we use engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX)-generated molecular labeling patterns to provide information regarding intracellular microenvironments in living cells. Using APEX labeling of specific proteins, we uncovered subcellular localization at sub-compartmental resolution and successfully elucidated the membrane protein topology of HMOX1 and sub-mitochondrial localization of recently identified mitochondrial proteins. This method can be expanded to confirm sub-mitochondrial localization and membrane topologies of previously identified mitochondrial proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Using high-throughput screening we identified small molecules that suppress superoxide and/or H2O2 production during reverse electron transport through mitochondrial respiratory complex I (site IQ) without affecting oxidative phosphorylation (suppressors of site IQ electron leak, “S1QELs”). S1QELs diminished endogenous oxidative damage in primary astrocytes cultured at ambient or low oxygen tension, showing that site IQ is a normal contributor to mitochondrial superoxide-H2O2 production in cells. They diminished stem cell hyperplasia in Drosophila intestine in vivo and caspase activation in a cardiomyocyte cell model driven by endoplasmic reticulum stress, showing that superoxide-H2O2 production by site IQ is involved in cellular stress signaling. They protected against ischemia-reperfusion injury in perfused mouse heart, showing directly that superoxide-H2O2 production by site IQ is a major contributor to this pathology. S1QELs are tools for assessing the contribution of site IQ to cell physiology and pathology and have great potential as therapeutic leads.

Abstract: Summary
The high rate of metastasis and recurrence among melanoma patients indicates the existence of cells within melanoma that have the ability to both initiate metastatic programs and bypass immune recognition. Here, we identify CD47 as a regulator of melanoma tumor metastasis and immune evasion. Protein and gene expression analysis of clinical melanoma samples reveals that CD47, an anti-phagocytic signal, correlates with melanoma metastasis. Antibody-mediated blockade of CD47 coupled with targeting of CD271+ melanoma cells strongly inhibits tumor metastasis in patient-derived xenografts. This therapeutic effect is mediated by drastic changes in the tumor and metastatic site immune microenvironments, both of whichwhich exhibit greatly increased density of differentiated macrophages and significantly fewer inflammatory monocytes, pro-metastatic macrophages (CCR2+/VEGFR1+), and neutrophils, all of which are associated with disease progression. Thus, antibody therapy that activates the innate immune response in combination with selective targeting of CD271+ melanoma cells represents a powerful therapeutic approach against metastatic melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Remodeling DNA methylation in mammalian genomes can be global, as seen in preimplantation embryos and primordial germ cells (PGCs), or locus specific, which can regulate neighboring gene expression. In PGCs, global and locus-specific DNA demethylation occur in sequential stages, with an initial global decrease in methylated cytosines (stage I) followed by a Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase (Tet)-dependent decrease in methylated cytosines that act at imprinting control regions (ICRs) and meiotic genes (stage II). The purpose of the two-stage mechanism is unclear. Here we show that Dnmt1 preserves DNA methylation through stage I at ICRs and meiotic gene promoters and is required for the pericentromeric enrichment of 5hmC. We discovered that the functional consequence of abrogating two-stage DNA demethylation in PGCs was precocious germline differentiation leading to hypogonadism and infertility. Therefore, bypassing stage-specific DNA demethylation has significant consequences for progenitor germ cell differentiation and the ability to transmit DNA from parent to offspring.

Abstract: Summary
Critical roles for DNA methylation in embryonic development are well established, but less is known about its roles during trophoblast development, the extraembryonic lineage that gives rise to the placenta. We dissected the role of DNA methylation in trophoblast development by performing mRNA and DNA methylation profiling of Dnmt3a/3b mutants. We find that oocyte-derived methylation plays a major role in regulating trophoblast development but that imprinting of the key placental regulator Ascl2 is only partially responsible for these effects. We have identified several methylation-regulated genes associated with trophoblast differentiation that are involved in cell adhesion and migration, potentially affecting trophoblast invasion. Specifically, trophoblast-specific DNA methylation is linked to the silencing of Scml2, a Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 protein that drives loss of cell adhesion in methylation-deficient trophoblast. Our results reveal that maternal DNA methylation controls multiple differentiation-related and physiological processes in trophoblast via both imprinting-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Previous efforts to identify cross-neutralizing antibodies to the receptor-binding site (RBS) of ebolavirus glycoproteins have been unsuccessful, largely because the RBS is occluded on the viral surface. We report a monoclonal antibody (FVM04) that targets a uniquely exposed epitope within the RBS; cross-neutralizes Ebola (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), and, to a lesser extent, Bundibugyo viruses; and shows protection against EBOV and SUDV in mice and guinea pigs. The antibody cocktail ZMapp™ is remarkably effective against EBOV (Zaire) but does not cross-neutralize other ebolaviruses. By replacing one of the ZMapp™ components with FVM04, we retained the anti-EBOV efficacy while extending the breadth of protection to SUDV, thereby generating a cross-protective antibody cocktail. In addition, we report several mutations at the base of the ebolavirus glycoprotein that enhance the binding of FVM04 and other cross-reactive antibodies. These findings have important implications for pan-ebolavirus vaccine development and defining broadly protective antibody cocktails.

Abstract: Summary
Control of cell-division orientation is integral to epithelial morphogenesis and asymmetric cell division. Proper spatiotemporal localization of the evolutionarily conserved Gαi-LGN-NuMA protein complex is critical for mitotic spindle orientation, but how this is achieved remains unclear. Here we identify Suppressor APC domain containing 2 (SAPCD2) as a previously unreported LGN-interacting protein. We show that SAPCD2 is essential to instruct planar mitotic spindle orientation in both epithelial cell cultures and mouse retinal progenitor cells in vivo. Loss of SAPCD2 randomizes spindle orientation, which in turn disrupts cyst morphogenesis in three-dimensional cultures, and triples the number of terminal asymmetric cell divisions in the developing retina. Mechanistically, we show that SAPCD2 negatively regulates the localization of LGN at the cell cortex, likely by competing with NuMA for its binding. These results uncover SAPCD2 as a key regulator of the ternary complex controlling spindle orientation during morphogenesis and asymmetric cell divisions.

Abstract: The N-methyl d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) mediating Ca2+ uptake upon stimulation with glutamate and glycine were recently discovered in red blood cells (RBC) of healthy humans. Activation of these receptors with agonists triggered transient Ca2+-dependent decrease in hemoglobin oxygen affinity in RBC suspension. The aim of this study was to assess the potential physiological relevance of this phenomenon. Two groups formed by either healthy untrained volunteers or endurance athletes were subjected to a stepwise incremental cycling test to exhaustion. Plasma glutamate levels, activity of the NMDARs, and hemoglobin O2 affinity were measured in blood samples obtained before and after the exercise in both groups. Increase in plasma glutamate levels following exercise was observed in both groups. Transient Ca2+ accumulation in response to the NMDAR stimulation with NMDA and glycine was followed by facilitated Ca2+ extrusion from the RBC and compensatory decrease in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Short-term activation of the receptors triggered a transient decrease in O2 affinity of hemoglobin in both groups. These exercise-induced responses were more pronounced in athletes compared to the untrained subjects. Athletes were initially presented with lower basal intracellular Ca2+ levels and hemoglobin oxygen affinity compared to non-trained controls. High basal plasma glutamate levels were associated with induction of hemolysis and formation of echinocytes upon stimulation with the receptor agonists. These findings suggest that glutamate release occurring during exhaustive exercise bouts may acutely facilitate O2 liberation from hemoglobin and improve oxygen delivery to the exercising muscle.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we uncover a mechanism for regulating the number of active presynaptic GABAB receptors (GABABRs) at nerve terminals, an important determinant of neurotransmitter release. We find that GABABRs gain access to axon terminals by lateral diffusion in the membrane. Their relative accumulation is dependent upon agonist activation and the presence of the two distinct sushi domains that are found only in alternatively spliced GABABR1a subunits. Following brief activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) using glutamate, GABABR diffusion is reduced, causing accumulation at presynaptic terminals in a Ca2+-dependent manner that involves phosphorylation of GABABR2 subunits at Ser783. This signaling cascade indicates how synaptically released glutamate can initiate, via a feedback mechanism, increased levels of presynaptic GABABRs that limit further glutamate release and excitotoxicity.

Abstract: During the arousal and startle response, locus coeruleus neurons, innervating practically all brain regions, release catecholamine noradrenaline, which reaches neural brain cells, including astrocytes. These glial cells respond to noradrenergic stimulation by simultaneous activation of the α- and β-adrenergic receptors (ARs) in the plasma membrane with increasing cytosolic levels of Ca2+ and cAMP, respectively. AR-activation controls a myriad of processes in astrocytes including glucose metabolism, gliosignal vesicle homeostasis, gene transcription, cell morphology and antigen-presenting functions, all of which have distinct temporal characteristics. It is known from biochemical studies that Ca2+ and cAMP signals in astrocytes can interact, however it is presently unclear whether the temporal properties of the two second messengers are time associated upon AR-activation. We used confocal microscopy to study AR agonist-induced intracellular changes in Ca2+ and cAMP in single cultured cortical rat astrocytes by real-time monitoring of the Ca2+ indicator Fluo4-AM and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based nanosensor A-kinase activity reporter 2 (AKAR2), which reports the activity of cAMP via its downstream effector protein kinase A (PKA). The results revealed that the activation of α1-ARs by phenylephrine triggers periodic (phasic) Ca2+ oscillations within 10s, while the activation of β-ARs by isoprenaline leads to a ∼10-fold slower tonic rise to a plateau in cAMP/PKA activity devoid of oscillations. Thus the concomitant activation of α- and β-ARs triggers the Ca2+ and cAMP second messenger systems in astrocytes with distinct temporal properties, which appears to be tailored to regulate downstream effectors in different time domains.

Abstract: Summary
Human platelets acutely increase mitochondrial energy generation following stimulation. Herein, a lipidomic circuit was uncovered whereby the substrates for this are exclusively provided by cPLA2, including multiple fatty acids and oxidized species that support energy generation via β-oxidation. This indicates that acute lipid membrane remodeling is required to support energetic demands during platelet activation. Phospholipase activity is linked to energy metabolism, revealing cPLA2 as a central regulator of both lipidomics and energy flux. Using a lipidomic approach (LipidArrays), we also estimated the total number of lipids in resting, thrombin-activated, and aspirinized platelets. Significant diversity between genetically unrelated individuals and a wealth of species was revealed. Resting platelets demonstrated ∼5,600 unique species, with only ∼50% being putatively identified. Thrombin elevated ∼900 lipids >2-fold with 86% newly appearing and 45% inhibited by aspirin supplementation, indicating COX-1 is required for major activation-dependent lipidomic fluxes. Many lipids were structurally identified. With ∼50% of the lipids being absent from databases, a major opportunity for mining lipids relevant to human health and disease is presented.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitin is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation at several sites, but the consequences of these modifications are largely unknown. Here, we synthesize multi-milligram quantities of ubiquitin phosphorylated at serine 20, serine 57, and serine 65 via genetic code expansion. We use these phosphoubiquitins for the enzymatic assembly of 20 isomeric phosphoubiquitin dimers, with different sites of isopeptide linkage and/or phosphorylation. We discover that phosphorylation of serine 20 on ubiquitin converts UBE3C from a dual-specificity E3 ligase into a ligase that primarily synthesizes K48 chains. We profile the activity of 31 deubiquitinases on the isomeric phosphoubiquitin dimers in 837 reactions, and we discover that phosphorylation at distinct sites in ubiquitin can activate or repress cleavage of a particular linkage by deubiquitinases and that phosphorylation at a single site in ubiquitin can control the specificity of deubiquitinases for distinct ubiquitin linkages.

Abstract: Summary
B cells are unique antigen-presenting cells because their antigen presentation machinery is closely tied to the B cell receptor. Autoreactive thymic B cells can efficiently present cognate self-antigens to mediate CD4+ T cell-negative selection. However, the nature of thymocyte-thymic B cell interaction and how this interaction affects the selection of thymic B cell repertoire and, in turn, the T cell repertoire are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that a large percentage of thymic B cells have undergone class switching intrathymically. Thymic B cell class switching requires cognate interaction with specific T cells. Class-switched thymic B cells have a distinct repertoire compared with unswitched thymic B cells or splenic B cells.

Abstract: Summary
One-carbon (1C) units for purine and thymidine synthesis can be generated from serine by cytosolic or mitochondrial folate metabolism. The mitochondrial 1C pathway is consistently overexpressed in cancer. Here, we show that most but not all proliferating mammalian cell lines use the mitochondrial pathway as the default for making 1C units. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mitochondrial pathway knockout activates cytosolic 1C-unit production. This reversal in cytosolic flux is triggered by depletion of a single metabolite, 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (10-formyl-THF), and enables rapid cell growth in nutrient-replete conditions. Loss of the mitochondrial pathway, however, renders cells dependent on extracellular serine to make 1C units and on extracellular glycine to make glutathione. HCT-116 colon cancer xenografts lacking mitochondrial 1C pathway activity generate the 1C units required for growth by cytosolic serine catabolism. Loss of both pathways precludes xenograft formation. Thus, either mitochondrial or cytosolic 1C metabolism can support tumorigenesis, with the mitochondrial pathway required in nutrient-poor conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The UbiB protein kinase-like (PKL) family is widespread, comprising one-quarter of microbial PKLs and five human homologs, yet its biochemical activities remain obscure. COQ8A (ADCK3) is a mammalian UbiB protein associated with ubiquinone (CoQ) biosynthesis and an ataxia (ARCA2) through unclear means. We show that mice lacking COQ8A develop a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia linked to Purkinje cell dysfunction and mild exercise intolerance, recapitulating ARCA2. Interspecies biochemical analyses show that COQ8A and yeast Coq8p specifically stabilize a CoQ biosynthesis complex through unorthodox PKL functions. Although COQ8 was predicted to be a protein kinase, we demonstrate that it lacks canonical protein kinase activity in trans. Instead, COQ8 has ATPase activity and interacts with lipid CoQ intermediates, functions that are likely conserved across all domains of life. Collectively, our results lend insight into the molecular activities of the ancient UbiB family and elucidate the biochemical underpinnings of a human disease.

Abstract: Summary
Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) recognize and cleave linkage-specific polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains, but mechanisms underlying specificity remain elusive in many cases. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus papain-like protease (PLpro) is a DUB that cleaves ISG15, a two-domain Ub-like protein, and Lys48-linked polyUb chains, releasing diUbLys48 products. To elucidate this specificity, we report the 2.85 Å crystal structure of SARS PLpro bound to a diUbLys48 activity-based probe. SARS PLpro binds diUbLys48 in an extended conformation via two contact sites, S1 and S2, which are proximal and distal to the active site, respectively. We show that specificity for polyUbLys48 chains is predicated on contacts in the S2 site and enhanced by an S1-S1′ preference for a Lys48 linkage across the active site. In contrast, ISG15 specificity is dominated by contacts in the S1 site. Determinants revealed for polyUbLys48 specificity should prove useful in understanding PLpro deubiquitinating activities in coronavirus infections.

Distinct Roles of HDAC3 in the Core Circadian Negative Feedback Loop Are Critical for Clock Function,

Abstract: Summary
In the core mammalian circadian negative feedback loop, the BMAL1-CLOCK complex activates the transcription of the genes Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry). To close the negative feedback loop, the PER-CRY complex interacts with the BMAL1-CLOCK complex to repress its activity. These two processes are separated temporally to ensure clock function. Here, we show that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a critical component of the circadian negative feedback loop by regulating both the activation and repression processes in a deacetylase activity-independent manner. Genetic depletion of Hdac3 results in low-amplitude circadian rhythms and dampened E-box-driven transcription. In subjective morning, HDAC3 is required for the efficient transcriptional activation process by regulating BMAL1 stability. In subjective night, however, HDAC3 blocks FBXL3-mediated CRY1 degradation and strongly promotes BMAL1 and CRY1 association. Therefore, these two opposing but temporally separated roles of HDAC3 in the negative feedback loop provide a mechanism for robust circadian gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Parent-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are established during gametogenesis and regulate parent-specific expression of imprinted genes. Monoallelic expression of imprinted genes is essential for development, suggesting that imprints are faithfully maintained in embryos and adults. To test this hypothesis, we targeted a reporter for genomic methylation to the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 intergenic DMR (IG-DMR) to assess the methylation of both parental alleles at single-cell resolution. Biallelic gain or loss of IG-DMR methylation occurred in a small fraction of mouse embryonic stem cells, significantly affecting developmental potency. Mice carrying the reporter in either parental allele showed striking parent-specific changes in IG-DMR methylation, causing substantial and consistent tissue- and cell-type-dependent signatures in embryos and postnatal animals. Furthermore, dynamics in DNA methylation persisted during adult neurogenesis, resulting in inter-individual diversity. This substantial cell-cell DNA methylation heterogeneity implies that dynamic DNA methylation variations in the adult may be of functional importance.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic development must proceed despite both internal molecular fluctuations and external perturbations. However, mechanisms that provide robustness to mechanical perturbation remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we use light-sheet microscopy, comprehensive single-cell tracking, and targeted cell ablation to study the response of Caenorhabditis elegans embryos to external compression. Compression changes the relative positions of many cells and causes severe distortions of the embryonic axes. A large-scale movement of cells then corrects this distortion. Only a few specific cells are required for these compensatory movements, and one cell, ABarppap, appears to generate force, dramatically changing as it moves to its correct local cellular environment. During these movements, we also observed “egressions”, cells moving out onto the surface, and lineages that undergo both ingression and egression. In total, our work describes how the embryo responds to a major mechanical deformation that can occur during the early development in situ and puts forward a model to explain how the response is coordinated.

Abstract: Summary
Cohesin is essential for the hierarchical organization of the eukaryotic genome and plays key roles in many aspects of chromosome biology. The conformation of cohesin bound to DNA remains poorly defined, leaving crucial gaps in our understanding of how cohesin fulfills its biological functions. Here, we use single-molecule microscopy to directly observe the dynamic and functional characteristics of cohesin bound to DNA. We show that cohesin can undergo rapid one-dimensional (1D) diffusion along DNA, but individual nucleosomes, nucleosome arrays, and other protein obstacles significantly restrict its mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DNA motor proteins can readily push cohesin along DNA, but they cannot pass through the interior of the cohesin ring. Together, our results reveal that DNA-bound cohesin has a central pore that is substantially smaller than anticipated. These findings have direct implications for understanding how cohesin and other SMC proteins interact with and distribute along chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of minichromosome maintenance protein 10 (Mcm10) causes replication stress. We uncovered that S. cerevisiae mcm10-1 mutants rely on the E3 SUMO ligase Mms21 and the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase complex Slx5/8 for survival. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified changes in the SUMO proteome of mcm10-1 mutants and revealed candidates regulated by Slx5/8. Such candidates included subunits of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC), Bir1 and Sli15, known to facilitate spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) activation. We show here that Slx5 counteracts SAC activation in mcm10-1 mutants under conditions of moderate replication stress. This coincides with the proteasomal degradation of sumoylated Bir1. Importantly, Slx5-dependent mitotic relief was triggered not only by Mcm10 deficiency but also by treatment with low doses of the alkylating drug methyl methanesulfonate. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which Slx5/8 allows for passage through mitosis when replication stress is tolerable.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a high-grade pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor. The transcription factors ASCL1 and NEUROD1 play crucial roles in promoting malignant behavior and survival of human SCLC cell lines. Here, we find that ASCL1 and NEUROD1 identify heterogeneity in SCLC, bind distinct genomic loci, and regulate mostly distinct genes. ASCL1, but not NEUROD1, is present in mouse pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, and only ASCL1 is required in vivo for tumor formation in mouse models of SCLC. ASCL1 targets oncogenic genes including MYCL1, RET, SOX2, and NFIB while NEUROD1 targets MYC. ASCL1 and NEUROD1 regulate different genes that commonly contribute to neuronal function. ASCL1 also regulates multiple genes in the NOTCH pathway including DLL3. Together, ASCL1 and NEUROD1 distinguish heterogeneity in SCLC with distinct genomic landscapes and distinct gene expression programs.

Abstract: Summary
We generated and compared Drosophila models of RET fusions CCDC6-RET and NCOA4-RET. Both RET fusions directed cells to migrate, delaminate, and undergo EMT, and both resulted in lethality when broadly expressed. In all phenotypes examined, NCOA4-RET was more severe than CCDC6-RET, mirroring their effects on patients. A functional screen against the Drosophila kinome and a library of cancer drugs found that CCDC6-RET and NCOA4-RET acted through different signaling networks and displayed distinct drug sensitivities. Combining data from the kinome and drug screens identified the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 plus the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib as a synergistic drug combination that is specific for NCOA4-RET. Our work emphasizes the importance of identifying and tailoring a patient’s treatment to their specific RET fusion isoform and identifies a multi-targeted therapy that may prove effective against tumors containing the NCOA4-RET fusion.

Abstract: Summary
While Bmp4 has a well-established role in the commitment of mesenchymal stem cells into the adipogenic lineage, its role in brown adipocyte formation and activity is not well defined. Here, we show that Bmp4 has a dual function in adipogenesis by inducing adipocyte commitment while inhibiting the acquisition of a brown phenotype during terminal differentiation. Selective brown adipose tissue overexpression of Bmp4 in mice induces a shift from a brown to a white-like adipocyte phenotype. This effect is mediated by Smad signaling and might be in part due to suppression of lipolysis, via regulation of hormone sensitive lipase expression linked to reduced Ppar activity. Given that we observed a strong correlation between BMP4 levels and adipocyte size, as well as insulin sensitivity in humans, we propose that Bmp4 is an important factor in the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor protein 53BP1, a pivotal regulator of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, was first identified as a p53-interacting protein over two decades ago. However, its direct contributions to p53-dependent cellular activities remain undefined. Here, we reveal that 53BP1 stimulates genome-wide p53-dependent gene transactivation and repression events in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and synthetic p53 activation. 53BP1-dependent p53 modulation requires both auto-oligomerization and tandem-BRCT domain-mediated bivalent interactions with p53 and the ubiquitin-specific protease USP28. Loss of these activities results in inefficient p53-dependent cell-cycle checkpoint and exit responses. Furthermore, we demonstrate 53BP1-USP28 cooperation to be essential for normal p53-promoter element interactions and gene transactivation-associated events, yet dispensable for 53BP1-dependent DSB repair regulation. Collectively, our data provide a mechanistic explanation for 53BP1-p53 cooperation in controlling anti-tumorigenic cell-fate decisions and reveal these activities to be distinct and separable from 53BP1’s regulation of DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are peripheral blood leukocytes that represent the first line of immune cell defense against bacterial and fungal infections but are also crucial players in the generation of the inflammatory response. Many neutrophil cell surface receptors regulate important cellular processes via activation of agonist-activated PI3Ks. We show here that activation of human neutrophils with insoluble immune complexes drives a previously uncharacterized, PI3K-dependent, non-canonical, pro-apoptotic signaling pathway, FcγR-PI3Kβ/δ-Cdc42-Pak-Mek-Erk. This is a rare demonstration of Ras/Raf-independent activation of Erk and of PI3K-mediated activation of Cdc42. In addition, comparative analysis of immune-complex- and fMLF-induced signaling uncovers key differences in pathways used by human and murine neutrophils. The non-canonical pathway we identify in this study may be important for the resolution of inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases that rely on immune-complex-driven neutrophil activation.

Abstract: The present study was undertaken in order to extend of our earlier work, focusing on the analysis of roles of cell-to-cell communications in the regulation of the subendothelial cell function. In present study, we have found that the expression of connexin43 (Cx43) is dramatically reduced in human atherosclerotic lesions, compared with undiseased intima. In atherosclerotic lesions, the number of so-called ‘connexin plaques’ was found to be lower in lipid-laden cells than in cells which were free from lipid inclusions. In primary cell culture, subendothelial intimal cells tended to create multicellular structures in the form of clusters. Cluster creation was accompanied by the formation of gap junctions between cells; the degree of gap junctional communication correlated with the density of cells in culture. We found that atherosclerosis-related processes such as DNA synthesis, protein synthesis and accumulation of intracellular cholesterol correlated with the degree of cell-to-cell communication. The relation of DNA and protein synthesis with cell-to-cell communication could be described as “bell-shaped”. We further incubated cells, cultured from undiseased subendothelial intima, with various forms of modified LDL causing intracellular cholesterol accumulation. After the incubation of intimal cells with modified LDL, intercellular communication has “dropped” considerably. The findings indicate that intracellular lipid accumulation might be a reason for a decrease of the number of gap junctions. The findings also suggest that the disintegration of cellular network is associated with foam cell formation, the process known as a key event of atherogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The NF-κB pathway plays important roles in immune responses. Although its regulation has been extensively studied, here, we report an unknown feedforward mechanism for the regulation of this pathway by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands in macrophages. During bacterial infections, TLR ligands upregulate the expression of the 11S proteasome subunit PSME3 via NF-κB-mediated transcription in macrophages. PSME3, in turn, enhances the transcriptional activity of NF-κB by directly binding to and destabilizing KLF2, a negative regulator of NF-κB transcriptional activity. Consistent with this positive role of PSME3 in NF-κB regulation and importance of the NF-κB pathway in host defense against bacterial infections, the lack of PSME3 in hematopoietic cells renders the hosts more susceptible to bacterial infections, accompanied by increased bacterial burdens in host tissues. Thus, this study identifies a substrate for PSME3 and elucidates a proteolysis-dependent, but ubiquitin-independent, mechanism for NF-κB regulation that is important for host defense and innate immunity.

Abstract: Head shaping in mammalian sperm is regulated by a number of factors including acrosome formation, nuclear condensation and the action of the microtubular manchette. A role has also been suggested for the attendant Sertoli cells and the perinuclear theca (PT). In comparison, relatively little information is available on this topic in birds and the presence of a PT per se has not been described in this vertebrate order. This study revealed that a similar combination of factors contributed to head shaping in the ostrich, emu and rhea, although the Sertoli cells seem to play a limited role in ratites. A fibro-granular structure analogous to the mammalian PT was identified, consisting of sub- and post-acrosomal components. The latter was characterized by stage-specific finger-like projections that appeared to emanate from the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope. They were particularly obvious beneath the base of the acrosome, and closely aligned, but not connected to, the manchette microtubules. During the final stages of chromatin condensation and elongation of the sperm head the projections abruptly disappeared. They appear to play a role in stabilizing the shape of the sperm head during the caudal translocation of the spermatid cytoplasm.

Abstract: Summary
HCMV is a highly sophisticated virus that has developed various mechanisms for immune evasion and viral dissemination throughout the body (partially mediated by neutrophils). NK cells play an important role in elimination of HCMV-infected cells. Both neutrophils and NK cells utilize similar sets of chemokine receptors to traffic, to and from, various organs. However, the mechanisms by which HCMV attracts neutrophils and not NK cells are largely unknown. Here, we show a unique viral protein, vCXCL1, which targets three chemokine receptors: CXCR1 and CXCR2 expressed on neutrophils and CXCR1 and CX3CR1 expressed on NK cells. Although vCXCL1 attracted both cell types, neutrophils migrated faster and more efficiently than NK cells through the binding of CXCR2. Therefore, we propose that HCMV has developed vCXCL1 to orchestrate its rapid systemic dissemination through preferential attraction of neutrophils and uses alternative mechanisms to counteract the later attraction of NK cells.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions of transcription factors (TFs) with DNA comprise a complex interplay between base-specific amino acid contacts and readout of DNA structure. Recent studies have highlighted the complementarity of DNA sequence and shape in modeling TF binding in vitro. Here, we have provided a comprehensive evaluation of in vivo datasets to assess the predictive power obtained by augmenting various DNA sequence-based models of TF binding sites (TFBSs) with DNA shape features (helix twist, minor groove width, propeller twist, and roll). Results from 400 human ChIP-seq datasets for 76 TFs show that combining DNA shape features with position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) scores improves TFBS predictions. Improvement has also been observed using TF flexible models and a machine-learning approach using a binary encoding of nucleotides in lieu of PSSMs. Incorporating DNA shape information is most beneficial for E2F and MADS-domain TF families. Our findings indicate that incorporating DNA sequence and shape information benefits the modeling of TF binding under complex in vivo conditions.

We used public domain data to locate signatures of positive selection based on derived allele frequency, genetic diversity, long haplotypes, and differences between populations at SNPs identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for BMI. We used SNPs near the lactase (LCT), SLC24A5, and SLC45A2 genes as positive controls and 120 randomly selected SNPs as negative controls. We found evidence for positive selection (p < 0.05) at nine out of 115 BMI SNPs. However, five of these involved positive selection for the protective allele (i.e., for leanness). The widespread absence of signatures of positive selection, combined with selection favoring leanness at some alleles, does not support the suggestion that obesity provided a selective advantage to survive famines, or any other selective advantage.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferons (IFNs) play both beneficial and harmful roles in antiviral responses. Precise regulation of host type I IFNs is thus needed to prevent immune dysregulation. Here, we find that the DNA demethylase TET3 is a negative regulator of IFN-β in response to poly(I:C) stimulation or viral infection. Deletion of TET3 enhances antiviral responses, with elevated expression of IFN-β and IFN-stimulated genes. The catalytic domain of TET3 was critical for the suppression of IFN-β production, but TET3 enzymatic activity was dispensable. Instead, the catalytic domain of TET3 interacts with HDAC1 and SIN3A, thus enhancing their binding to the Ifnb1 promoter. Our study demonstrates that TET3 negatively regulates type I IFN production independent of DNA demethylation. This not only sheds light on TET3 as a signaling protein in immune cells for gene regulation but also will help to develop strategies to prevent type I IFN-related disease.

Abstract: Summary
Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family proteins convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. We show that mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) depleted of Tet1 and/or Tet2 by RNAi exhibit short telomeres and chromosomal instability, concomitant with reduced telomere recombination. Tet1 and Tet2 double-knockout ESCs also display short telomeres but to a lesser extent. Notably, Tet1/2/3 triple-knockout ESCs show heterogeneous telomere lengths and increased frequency of telomere loss and chromosomal fusion. Mechanistically, Tets depletion or deficiency increases Dnmt3b and decreases 5hmC levels, resulting in elevated methylation levels at sub-telomeres. Consistently, knockdown of Dnmt3b or addition of 2i (MAPK and GSK3β inhibitors), which also inhibits Dnmt3b, reduces telomere shortening, partially rescuing Tet1/2 deficiency. Interestingly, Tet1/2 double or Tet1/2/3 triple knockout in ESCs consistently upregulates Zscan4, which may counteract telomere shortening. Together, Tet enzymes play important roles in telomere maintenance and chromosomal stability of ESCs by modulating sub-telomeric methylation levels.

Abstract: Summary
PTPN12 is an important tumor suppressor that plays critical roles in various physiological processes. However, the molecular basis underlying the substrate specificity of PTPN12 remains uncertain. Here, enzymological and crystallographic studies have enabled us to identify two distinct structural features that are crucial determinants of PTPN12 substrate specificity: the pY+1 site binding pocket and specific basic charged residues along its surface loops. Key structurally plastic regions and specific residues in PTPN12 enabled recognition of different HER2 phosphorylation sites and regulated specific PTPN12 functions. In addition, the structure of PTPN12 revealed a CDK2 phosphorylation site in a specific PTPN12 loop. Taken together, our results not only provide the working mechanisms of PTPN12 for desphosphorylation of its substrates but will also help in designing specific inhibitors of PTPN12.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of neurons from neural stem cells requires large-scale changes in gene expression that are controlled to a large extent by proneural transcription factors, such as Ascl1. While recent studies have characterized the differentiation genes activated by proneural factors, less is known on the mechanisms that suppress progenitor cell identity. Here, we show that Ascl1 induces the transcription factor MyT1 while promoting neuronal differentiation. We combined functional studies of MyT1 during neurogenesis with the characterization of its transcriptional program. MyT1 binding is associated with repression of gene transcription in neural progenitor cells. It promotes neuronal differentiation by counteracting the inhibitory activity of Notch signaling at multiple levels, targeting the Notch1 receptor and many of its downstream targets. These include regulators of the neural progenitor program, such as Hes1, Sox2, Id3, and Olig1. Thus, Ascl1 suppresses Notch signaling cell-autonomously via MyT1, coupling neuronal differentiation with repression of the progenitor fate.

Abstract: Summary
Although compensatory islet hyperplasia in response to insulin resistance is a recognized feature in diabetes, the factor(s) that promote β cell proliferation have been elusive. We previously reported that the liver is a source for such factors in the liver insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mouse, an insulin resistance model that manifests islet hyperplasia. Using proteomics we show that serpinB1, a protease inhibitor, which is abundant in the hepatocyte secretome and sera derived from LIRKO mice, is the liver-derived secretory protein that regulates β cell proliferation in humans, mice, and zebrafish. Small-molecule compounds, that partially mimic serpinB1 effects of inhibiting elastase activity, enhanced proliferation of β cells, and mice lacking serpinB1 exhibit attenuated β cell compensation in response to insulin resistance. Finally, SerpinB1 treatment of islets modulated proteins in growth/survival pathways. Together, these data implicate serpinB1 as an endogenous protein that can potentially be harnessed to enhance functional β cell mass in patients with diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroblastoma is a pediatric embryonal malignancy characterized by impaired neuronal differentiation. A better understanding of neuroblastoma differentiation is essential for developing new therapeutic approaches. GDE2 (encoded by GDPD5) is a six-transmembrane-domain glycerophosphodiesterase that promotes embryonic neurogenesis. We find that high GDPD5 expression is strongly associated with favorable outcome in neuroblastoma. GDE2 induces differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, suppresses cell motility, and opposes RhoA-driven neurite retraction. GDE2 alters the Rac-RhoA activity balance and the expression of multiple differentiation-associated genes. Mechanistically, GDE2 acts by cleaving (in cis) and releasing glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glypican-6, a putative co-receptor. A single point mutation in the ectodomain abolishes GDE2 function. Our results reveal GDE2 as a cell-autonomous inducer of neuroblastoma differentiation with prognostic significance and potential therapeutic value.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to sense energy status is crucial in the regulation of metabolism via the mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1). The assembly of the TTT-Pontin/Reptin complex is responsive to changes in energy status. Under energy-sufficient conditions, the TTT-Pontin/Reptin complex promotes mTORC1 dimerization and mTORC1-Rag interaction, which are critical for mTORC1 activation. We show that WAC is a regulator of energy-mediated mTORC1 activity. In a Drosophila screen designed to isolate mutations that cause neuronal dysfunction, we identified wacky, the homolog of WAC. Loss of Wacky leads to neurodegeneration, defective mTOR activity, and increased autophagy. Wacky and WAC have conserved physical interactions with mTOR and its regulators, including Pontin and Reptin, which bind to the TTT complex to regulate energy-dependent activation of mTORC1. WAC promotes the interaction between TTT and Pontin/Reptin in an energy-dependent manner, thereby promoting mTORC1 activity by facilitating mTORC1 dimerization and mTORC1-Rag interaction.

Wnt Signalosome Assembly by DEP Domain Swapping of Dishevelled,

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular signals are often transduced by dynamic signaling complexes (“signalosomes”) assembled by oligomerizing hub proteins following their recruitment to signal-activated transmembrane receptors. A paradigm is the Wnt signalosome, which is assembled by Dishevelled via reversible head-to-tail polymerization by its DIX domain. Its activity causes stabilization of β-catenin, a Wnt effector with pivotal roles in animal development and cancer. How Wnt triggers signalosome assembly is unknown. Here, we use structural analysis, as well as biophysical and cell-based assays, to show that the DEP domain of Dishevelled undergoes a conformational switch, from monomeric to swapped dimer, to trigger DIX-dependent polymerization and signaling to β-catenin. This occurs in two steps: binding of monomeric DEP to Frizzled followed by DEP domain swapping triggered by its high local concentration upon Wnt-induced recruitment into clathrin-coated pits. DEP domain swapping confers directional bias on signaling, and the dimerization provides cross-linking between Dishevelled polymers, illustrating a key principle underlying signalosome formation.

Cellulose-Microtubule Uncoupling Proteins Prevent Lateral Displacement of Microtubules during Cellulose Synthesis in Arabidopsis,

Abstract: Summary
Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on Earth and is the major contributor to plant morphogenesis. Cellulose is synthesized by plasma membrane-localized cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs). Nascent cellulose microfibrils become entangled in the cell wall, and further catalysis therefore drives the CSC forward through the membrane: a process guided by cortical microtubules via the protein CSI1/POM2. Still, it is unclear how the microtubules can withstand the forces generated by the motile CSCs to effectively direct CSC movement. Here, we identified a family of microtubule-associated proteins, the cellulose synthase-microtubule uncouplings (CMUs), that located as static puncta along cortical microtubules. Functional disruption of the CMUs caused lateral microtubule displacement and compromised microtubule-based guidance of CSC movement. CSCs that traversed the microtubules interacted with the microtubules via CSI1/POM2, which prompted the lateral microtubule displacement. Hence, we have revealed how microtubules can withstand the propulsion of the CSCs during cellulose biosynthesis and thus sustain anisotropic plant cell growth.

Abstract: Summary
NIPBL, a cohesin loader, has been implicated in transcriptional control and genome organization. Mutations in NIPBL, cohesin, and its deacetylase HDAC8 result in Cornelia de Lange syndrome. We report activation of the RNA-sensing kinase PKR in human lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying NIPBL or HDAC8 mutations, but not SMC1A or SMC3 mutations. PKR activation can be triggered by unmodified RNAs. Gene expression profiles in NIPBL-deficient lymphoblastoid cells and mouse embryonic stem cells reveal lower expression of genes involved in RNA processing and modification. NIPBL mutant lymphoblastoid cells show reduced proliferation and protein synthesis with increased apoptosis, all of which are partially reversed by a PKR inhibitor. Non-coding RNAs from an NIPBL mutant line had less m6A modification and activated PKR activity in vitro. This study provides insight into the molecular pathology of Cornelia de Lange syndrome by establishing a relationship between NIPBL and HDAC8 mutations and PKR activation.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA exosome is a 3′–5′ ribonuclease complex that is composed of nine core subunits and an essential catalytic subunit, Rrp44. Two distinct conformations of Rrp44 were revealed in previous structural studies, suggesting that Rrp44 may change its conformation to exert its function. In the channeling conformation, (Rrp44ch), RNA accesses the active site after traversing the central channel of the RNA exosome, whereas in the other conformation, (Rrp44da), RNA gains direct access to the active site. Here, we show that the Rrp44da exosome is important for nuclear function of the RNA exosome. Defects caused by disrupting the direct access conformation are distinct from those caused by channel-occluding mutations, indicating specific functions for each conformation. Our genetic analyses provide in vivo evidence that the RNA exosome employs a direct-access route to recruit specific substrates, indicating that the RNA exosome uses alternative conformations to act on different RNA substrates.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription controls splicing and other gene regulatory processes, yet mechanisms remain obscure due to our fragmented knowledge of the molecular connections between the dynamically phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD) and regulatory factors. By systematically isolating phosphorylation states of the CTD heptapeptide repeat (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7), we identify hundreds of protein factors that are differentially enriched, revealing unappreciated connections between the Pol II CTD and co-transcriptional processes. These data uncover a role for threonine-4 in 3′ end processing through control of the transition between cleavage and termination. Furthermore, serine-5 phosphorylation seeds spliceosomal assembly immediately downstream of 3′ splice sites through a direct interaction with spliceosomal subcomplex U1. Strikingly, threonine-4 phosphorylation also impacts splicing by serving as a mark of co-transcriptional spliceosome release and ensuring efficient post-transcriptional splicing genome-wide. Thus, comprehensive Pol II interactomes identify the complex and functional connections between transcription machinery and other gene regulatory complexes.
